1	What makes bed bugs spread and how can hotels prevent them?	Bed bugs are knowledgeable hitchhikers mainly transported by humans and their belongings like suitcases. According to the CDC, bed bugs can appear anywhere from fancy hotels to campgrounds, regardless of cleanliness. To prevent them, hotels should implement routine housekeeping, while guests should check travel reviews for bed bug reports, inspect headboards, mattresses, and bed frames upon check-in, keep suitcases on luggage racks instead of floors or beds, and avoid storing clothing in dressers.

At one time an afterthought, such pests have recently made quite the comeback. The more you understand about bed bugs, the better your opportunities of avoiding them.\nBasics of Bed BugsBed bugs derive their name from the truth that they’re typically discovered in close proximity to beds. That is because these pests require the blood of warm-blooded animals in order to survive. Unfortunately, they may mature in around 35 days. Then, they live around 7 - 12 months. It’ll make removal of bed bugs challenging to do without the assistance of the professionals.\nBed Bug BitesBed bugs mainly feed on human beings sleeping in bed overnight. Their bite is painless, and its blood meal takes around ten minutes.\nThe HuntHow will bed bugs find a host while they’re asleep? The CO2 from exhaled breath, body heat, and additional biological signatures assist in focusing the bed bugs on snoozing, unsuspecting hosts. Bed bugs feed, then retreat back to their place of harborage for days or perhaps weeks before returning back to the surface. It might make detection hard until the infestation is highly established.\nOn the MoveThese pests are knowledgeable hitchhikers. As a matter of fact, they’re mainly transported by human beings and humans’ belongings such as suitcases.\nBe on the Lookout for Bed BugsThe smaller an infestation, the easier extermination is to perform. That is why it is vital that you spot any potential infestation as early as you can.\nWhat does their Skin Look Like?The shed skin of bed bugs appears almost identical to live bed bugs. The difference between the skin and the actual bug is that its exoskeleton will look translucent and empty and obviously can’t move. As an infestation continues and mating is ongoing, immature bed bugs start making up most of the population. During this time, every adult bed bug already has molted multiple times. As shed skins don’t decompose at the same pace, they’ll begin building up over a period of time.That means you’ll stand a better opportunity at spotting the clear exoskeletons than actual bugs, particularly since its skins are going to be discovered in larger clusters along a mattress seam, headboard, box spring, baseboards and even trapped to your pajamas and bedding.You’ll find a variety of sizes of skins depending upon the life stage:\n- 1 mm - Bed bug egg\n- 5 mm – 1st-stage instar nymph\n- 2 mm – 2nd-stage instar nymph\n- 5 mm – 3rd-stage instar nymph\n- 3 mm – 4th-stage instar nymph\n- 5 mm – 5th-stage instar nymph\nBed Bugs: How often do they shed?The bugs only shed after they finish a blood feeding at each of the initial five life stages. Depending upon food availability (that is, blood sources) as well as temperature, each stage (under ideal conditions) will last around a week. If food isn’t readily available or if conditions are too cold, each molt and shedding thereafter may take longer.\nBed Bug Shedding: What should you do with it?As you see bed bug skins, immediately stop your search. Continuing your search or cleaning up may disturb the living bugs, and cause them to hide and scatter. It’ll potentially spread the infestation to additional areas of your house. Instead, contact Janssen Pest Solutions at 515-519-3447 to eliminate bed bugs, as well as their dirty skins.\nIndications of Bed BugsThese pests are great at hiding, yet not great at concealing evidence. The careless clues left behind are the best sign that your room is overrun with these pests. Some clues to search for include:\n- Blood stains on PJs and sheets\n- Fecal stains on bedding\n- Shed bed bug shells, exoskeletons, or skins\nIndications of Bed Bug BitesBite reactions in skin appear like those that are caused by mosquitoes and fleas. Telling which pest caused a bite may not be possible. Search for these indications of bed bug bite symptoms:\n- Lines of several bites\n- Bed bug bite rash around a localized space\n- Itching and burning\n- Red, raised welts\nWhere do you Look?The right bed bug control will require a watchful eye. In order to feed on human beings, bed bugs desire close proximity to their host. Inside the bedroom, headboards, box springs, and bed framing are favorite areas for these bugs. They also may settle inside furniture, as well as fixtures close to the bed.Bedrooms aren’t the only area in which these pests might be a problem. The feeding does not need to be overnight. All these pests want are human hosts who inactive long enough to offer a meal. Eliminating bed bugs is challenging. Any area which human beings sleep, rest, or sit may be a space that bed bugs feed or are introduced.Sitting for a couple of hours inside a theater will make you a target. You might become a target riding in a cab across town. You can also make a target inside your favorite recliner in your living room.\nPut Your Concerns to RestThese pests have an uncanny capability of spreading using unsuspecting individuals and their valuables as carriers.Following the measures below will assist in minimizing the opportunities for you running into these pests. Most importantly, it’ll help to minimize the odds of you bringing some to the house with you.\n- Firstly, check all travel reviews before you visit a hotel, and be aware of the ones that have several bed bug reports.\n- As you check into your hotel, check your headboard, mattress, bed frame, as well as pictures for any bed bug signs.\n- Instead of storing suitcases on the floor or bed, keep your suitcases on the luggage rack.\n- Don’t store clothing inside dressers and hang clothing that may be hung.', 'by Russell Riviera,\nThese days, Bed bug country is far from a make-believe place, since the little bloodsucking pests have been spotted everywhere from coast to coast. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports that bed bugs can show up everywhere from fancy hotels to rustic campgrounds, and their presence is unrelated to a place’s cleanliness. To get rid of bed bugs takes a tremendous amount of diligence on the part of the hospitality industry and what’s worse is that the suckers can spread easily through travel since typical hotel guests may not always look closely at linens or carpeting. Once the bugs stow aboard your luggage, they may jump off at the next warm place, whether it’s another hotel or your home.\nAre there ways to avoid them? Possibly. Here’s how.\nKnow What They Look Like\nBeyond knowing that they’re tiny and come out more at night, the average person may not be as familiar with their appearance. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) site says bed bugs are between 1 mm and 7 mm, about the size of Lincoln’s head on a penny, so they can be seen by the naked eye if you’re looking for them. They can be brown to red in color, depending on how recently they’ve fed.\nRecognize the Signs\nEven if you don’t see bugs themselves, since they tend to hide in dark, warm places, the EPA said you can see where they’ve been recently, such as looking for shed skin, dark spots, blood smears or a sweet, musty odor.\nCheck and Clean Your Surroundings\nThe EPA and CDC advise looking into places that they could be can help, such as furniture, beds, or couches. Not everyone knows to do this while traveling, but it can be part of your checking in process into a new hotel room or vacation rental. Vacuuming and changing linens when you arrive may work if you’re staying at a home, but may not work at a hotel. However, housekeeping is supposed to do this routinely anyway.\nStore Your Belongings Away from Possible Infestation\nIf you want to get rid of bed bugs at a hotel, consider placing your luggage on a rack so it does not come into contact with the carpet, beds, furniture or walls, which are all places where bed bugs can enter.\nFind Out About the Hotel’s Treatment Methods\nBecause bed bugs are considered a public health concern, good hotels should be happy to share their prevention methods. Check online travel sites to see if guests have reported bed bugs at individual properties. The Bed Bug Registry website invites people to share where and when they’ve spotted bed bugs nationwide in the U.S. and Canada. There are more than 20,000 sightings in 12,000 locations.\nInspect Your Luggage Before Departure\nWhile repacking, look through all your items plus your suitcase. If you fear infection, travel site RandMcNally suggests putting your luggage in a lawn-sized garbage bag on the way home. This will stop them from spreading from your suitcase into your car. Finally, when you get home, take your suitcase to the laundry area first and wash your laundry in hot water right away. You can even visit the local laundromat instead of unpacking elsewhere in your home.']	['<urn:uuid:39648f05-fecb-44ac-88da-0e0a26430d65>', '<urn:uuid:d3f746b4-5796-4520-b986-38b7db66c997>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	11	73	1521
2	What are the two types of liability a business can face?	There are two types of liability: tort liability, which occurs when you intentionally commit an act that causes damage, and consequential liability, which occurs when an unintentional act causes damages.	"['Smart managers mitigate risk to an acceptable level.\nBy Marty McGhie\nIn today""?s business world, we encounter some measure of risk in almost everything we do. Whether we are hiring a new employee, producing a product, dealing with a customer, or borrowing money from the bank, we are constantly evaluating and accepting risk. The smart and successful manager weighs the risks and makes decisions that will most often mitigate risk to an acceptable level.\nIf you are successful in that process, your decisions will generate\nassets to the company. If not, however, you might incur liabilities. Some of these liabilities may result from the products we generate""?liabilities you may not even be aware of.\nTwo types of liability\nTo illustrate, allow me to relate an experience our company recently encountered. Several months ago, we produced some pole banners for a retail establishment""?s parking lot. The banners were double-sided, printed on vinyl, and were installed to hardware attached to the light poles in the parking lot""?pretty standard stuff. We produced the output and outsourced the install (we were the ""face""? of the install to the client).\nThen, a few weeks ago, a fairly strong wind came through the area, blowing down one of the light poles that had a banner attached to it. Thankfully, no one was injured and there was no property damage""?other than the pole and, of course, the banner\nwith its hardware. The client called to inform us of the incident. In addition, they told us that they felt that we were liable for the damages because we didn""?t do the proper due diligence to determine the wind-load capacity of the poles created by having the banners attached.\nI""?m not simply venting my frustration here or criticizing a client (in fact, we""?re working this out with our client and they are being very reasonable). Rather, I relate this experience to you in an effort to help you think differently about the liability you may face with the products you""?re producing.\nFrom a legal perspective, there are two different types of liability you can incur. The first type of liability is tort liability. Tort liability occurs when you intentionally commit an act that causes damage. For example, if you deliberately use materials that are unsafe or outside of engineering specs to save money; if your product fails causing personal or property damage, you could be held liable for tort damages due to your intentional negligence.\nGetting the Jump on Liability Issues\nA different type of liability occurs when an unintentional act, even something outside your control, causes damages""?this is called consequential liability or consequential damages. This type of liability is more difficult to identify, more difficult to prevent,\nand more difficult to control in terms of damages.\nFor example, let""?s assume you have the job of producing all the trade-show graphics for a client""?s booth; you also have agreed to ship them and install them for your client. But, machinery breaks down, you are late on the job, your delivery truck breaks down, etc. As a result, you are never able to actually deliver the graphics to your client. Your client ends up having\nno graphics and, essentially, no booth at the show.\nSo what are your damages? The easy one is the cost of the graphics""?it would be pretty difficult to charge your client for those. Consequential damages, however, also become part of the equation here: Do you owe your client for the rental of the booth space? How about the client""?s travel and lodging expenses? What about the salaries and wages of those hired to work the booth? Here""?s a big one: Could you owe money for the loss of business they experienced (or will experience in the future) for not having a booth at this trade show? You can see that this can quickly snowball and become a very big problem.\nBy now you probably get the point: Consequential liability can have serious ramifications on your company""?s bottom line. So what can you do to prevent this kind of consequential liability? I have three recommendations:\nFirst, establish sound business practices. For example, don""?t ever compromise on safety. Put together a comprehensive safety program ensuring employee safety at all times and all locations. If a project is complex, spend the necessary time and money to prevent problematic situations. Hire an engineer if you need to and use subcontractors that are contracted and licensed to do the required work. Yes, these are commonsense suggestions, but it""?s amazing how many of us take the shortcut\nroute, keeping our fingers crossed that the project will go smoothly ""just this once.""? Typically, however, if you are trying to cut corners, those are the projects that will generally get us into trouble. So get into the habit of applying good business sense.\nSecond, purchase the right amount of insurance. In addition, meet with your insurance company""?s representative and ask them to help you identify situations and experiences they may have had with other clients. Determine if you have adequate insurance to cover these types of potential issues (as well as any other scenarios you can come up with). If your insurance company does not know or is not sure, fire them and hire someone who does know. A proactive and knowledgeable insurance representative can save you a lot of heartache and money. And in addition to your own insurance, you need to verify that all subcontractors you use are fully insured and that you are named on their insurance policy as an additional insured. This way, if there is a problem, your insurance coverage will be secondary to theirs.\nThird, get legal help. The ideas and examples I""?ve noted in this column have just scratched the surface. I""?m not an attorney, so don""?t assume that I have given you anywhere close to the total amount of legal advice you may need. Discuss these types of situations with your attorney, and then structure your business organization and practices in a way that will prevent you from incurring unnecessary liabilities.\nNo ""?mini""? problem\nRecently, our shop wrapped a BMW Mini Cooper. ""While it""?s there, why don""?t you take it out for a spin?""? the customer suggested. So as not to offend her, I obliged.\nAs I drove the Mini around, however, I noticed that the vehicle""?s back windows and the rear window were not wrapped in perforated vinyl""?I couldn""?t see out of them. My only reference for looking behind me were the car""?s two tiny side mirrors. Consequential liability was the first thing that popped into my mind. I immediately (after my little ride, anyway) talked to the sales rep and had her e-mail the client, advising her to wrap the windows in perforated vinyl so as to prevent a possible accident in his future.\nWe should all condition ourselves to think about these types of liability issues, and avoid the problems down the road. Better for you, and your client, if you evaluate up-front the worst-case scenario and consider how you can change that now.\nMarty McGhie (firstname.lastname@example.org) is VP finance/\noperations of Ferrari Color, a digital-imaging center with Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and Sacramento locations.\nDid you enjoy this article?

3	I've been thinking about getting back into swimming after many years. What are the main health benefits of swimming, and what injuries should I watch out for as someone starting again?	Swimming offers several health benefits - it's a low-impact workout that builds endurance, muscle strength, and cardiovascular fitness, and can be done for a lifetime. However, you should be cautious when starting, as beginning too quickly can lead to injuries. The shoulder (rotator cuff) is particularly susceptible to injury in swimmers due to continuous rotation. When returning to swimming, it's important to ease back into the activity gradually - experts recommend reducing physical activity by about 50% initially and having a pre-season conditioning program to build up strength and fitness. If you experience pain, stop immediately and apply ice for 15-20 minutes several times a day. Any pain lasting more than 2-3 days should be examined by a physician.	"['Swimming is an individual or team sport that uses arms and legs to move the body through water. The sport takes place in pools or open water (e.g., in a sea or lake). Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports, with varied distance events in butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley. In addition to these individual events, four swimmers can take part in either a freestyle or medley relay. Swimming each stroke requires specific techniques, and in competition, there are specific regulations concerning the acceptable form for different strokes.\nMen\'s swimming became part of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens. In 1908, the world swimming association, Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA), was formed. Women\'s swimming was introduced into the Olympics in 1912; the first international tournament for women outside the Olympics was the 1922 Women\'s Olympiad.\nFINA is the international federation recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for administering international competition in water sports. It is one of several international federations which administer a given sport or discipline for the IOC and international community. FINA currently oversees competition in five aquatics sports: swimming, diving, artistic swimming, water polo, and open water swimming.\nEvents of FINA:\n- World Aquatics Championships: The biggest FINA event is the biennial World Aquatics Championships, currently held every odd year. It features competitions in all five aquatic disciplines.\n- Discipline championships\n- Swimming: World Swimming Championships (25m), (a.k.a. ""Short Course Worlds""). Bi-annual event (in even years), swum in 25-meter length pool (Olympic and World Championships are in a 50m pool).\n- Open Water: World Open Water Swimming Championships (a.k.a. ""Open Water Worlds"").\n- Artistic swimming: Synchro World Trophy.\n- Masters: World Masters Championships (a.k.a. ""Masters Worlds""). Bi-annual, in even years. ""Masters"" competition is for adults (20 years old and up). This championships features all 5 disciplines.\n- Discipline world cups: In addition to the championships events listed above, FINA also organizes the following events:\n- Swimming: Swimming World Cup.\n- Open Water: 10 km Marathon Swimming World Cup.\n- Artistic Swimming: Synchro World Cup. Every 4 years.\n- Junior championships: A world-level championships restricted to a younger age, vary by discipline/gender:\n- Swimming: World Junior Swimming Championships.\n- Open Water: Junior Open Water Swimming World Championships.\n- Artistic Swimming: World Junior Synchronised Swimming Championships\nThe Swimming Federation of India (SFI) is the central governing body for promotion and administration of swimming sport in India. The SFI is affiliated to FINA, the world governing body for the sport. SFI was formed after the amalgamation of its predecessors – the National Swimming Association (NSA) and the Indian Swimming Federation (ISF). The SFI was formed in 1948\nThe SFI Annually conducts the following events:\n- Sub Junior National Aquatic Championships\n- Junior National Aquatic Championships\n- Senior National Aquatic Championships\n- National Masters Swimming\n- National Club Championships\nSwimming meets in India: upcoming meets\nSome of the organisations offering swimming training in India are:\n- Nisha Millet Swimming Academy, Bangalore: visit (www.nishamillet.com)\n- Michael Phelps Swimming School: visit (michaelphelpsswimming.in)\n- YMCA Swimming Pool, Tardeo, Mumbai: visit (ymcabombay.org)\n- Ramagya Sports Academy, Noida: visit (ramagyasportsacademy.com)\n- Fitso Seals, Noida: visit (www.getfitso.com)\n- Dolphin Swimming Academy, Chennai: visit (www.dolphinswimmingacademy.com)\nCompetitive swimming: Competitive swimming became popular in the 19th century. The goal of competitive swimming is to break personal or world records while beating competitors in any given event. Swimming is an event at the Summer Olympic Games, where male and female athletes compete in 16 of the recognized events each. Olympic events are held in a 50-meter pool, called a long course pool. There are forty officially recognized individual swimming events in the pool; however the International Olympic Committee only recognizes 32 of them.\nOpen water: In open water swimming, where the events are swum in a body of open water (lake or sea), there are also 5 km, 10 km and 25 km events for men and women. However, only the 10 km event is included in the Olympic schedule, again for both men and women. Open-water competitions are typically separate to other swimming competitions with the exception of the World Championships and the Olympics.\nSwim styles: In competitive swimming, four major styles have been established. These have been relatively stable over the last 30–40 years with minor improvements. They are:\nIn competition, only one of these styles may be used except in the case of the individual medley, or IM, which consists of all four. In this latter event, swimmers swim equal distances of butterfly, then backstroke, breaststroke, and finally, freestyle. In Olympic competition, this event is swum in two distances – 200 and 400 meters.\nDolphin kick: Since the 1990s, the most drastic change in swimming has been the addition of the underwater dolphin kick. This is used to maximize the speed at the start and after the turns in all styles. The first successful use of it was by David Berkoff. At the 1988 Olympics, he swam most of the 100 m backstroke race underwater and broke the world record in the distance during the preliminaries. however currently swimmers are not allowed to go any further than fifteen metres underwater due to rule changes by FINA.\nElite and international swimming: Elite and international swimming comprises the highest level of competition available to swimmers, including competitions such as the Olympic Games and FINA World Aquatics Championships.\nProfessionalism: Swimming creates a mix of levels, including: fully professional, semi-professional, and amateur. Fully professional swimmers will typically get a salary both from their national governing body and from outside sponsors, semi-professionals a small stipend from their national governing body, and amateurs receive no funding.\nHealth benefits: Swimming is a healthy workout that can be done for a lifetime. It is a low-impact workout that has several mental and bodily health benefits, and can be a recreational activity. Swimming builds endurance, muscle strength, and cardiovascular fitness.\nCommon injuries: Due to continuous rotation and usage, the shoulder (rotator cuff) is the joint most susceptible to injury in swimmers.', ""Most Common Sports Injuries\n- 06-14-2006, 04:17 PM\nMost Common Sports Injuries\nNo Pain? Your Gain\nDon’t play harder—play smarter. How to avoid the most common athletic injuries\nBy Amy Lynn Smith\nWatching the power, grace and determination of Olympic athletes can inspire the rest of us to get off the couch and exercise—that is, until reality soon knocks us flat on our aching backs.\nStarting an exercise program too fast can be a prescription for injury. “People often forget they’re not as young or flexible as they once were,” says Don LeMay, DO, a sports medicine specialist with the OSU Sports Medicine Center.\nAnd many people make it worse by not listening to their bodies. “‘No pain, no gain’ really doesn’t have any place in athletics,” says Jim Borchers, MD, also a sports medicine specialist. “Pain is your body telling you that something’s wrong and you need to stop.”\nStaying Out of Trouble\nLeMay and Borchers are physicians at the OSU Sports Medicine Center, where their patients include many OSU athletes and the general\npublic. Here’s their expert take on cures for the most common sports injuries they see.\nAnkle Sprains and Strains\nA number of factors can lead to ankle sprains, including poor technique and uneven terrain. And, according to Borchers, having the right footwear for your sport is paramount.\nIf you’ve had ankle problems in the past, an ankle brace can provide extra stability to prevent re-injury. Physical therapy after an injury can increase strength and range of motion.\nKnee injuries are often caused by improper technique, lack of conditioning and poor flexibility. While it’s important to build up training gradually to avoid overuse, the mechanics of a runner’s feet can also come into play, LeMay says. “Do you have flat feet or high arches? Or do you tend to walk more on the inside or outside of your feet? All of these factors can contribute to knee pain,” he explains. Appropriate footwear or orthotics—shoe inserts to improve body alignment—can be helpful in reducing injury risk.\nLower Back Pain\nLower back pain is a common complaint—and inactivity is the biggest culprit, LeMay says.\n“As we get older and less active, we lose the balance in the deep abdominal and lower back muscles,” he explains. “They’re weakened and easily fatigued, leading to pain.”\nConsistent activity is the best way to protect your lower back, including regular exercise and stretching.\nTennis players and golfers are particularly prone to elbow injuries. Although conditioning is important here, proper technique is critical, Borchers says. “If you can, take a class or get professional golf or tennis instruction,” he suggests. “Equipment can be an issue, too, like making sure your tennis racket has an adequate grip size.”\nFrequently seen in throwing sports, rotator cuff tendonitis is a common cause of shoulder pain. Staying in shape and easing back into an activity are the best ways to prevent problems.\n“People want to throw the football around with family and friends on Thanksgiving weekend,” says LeMay, “but if it’s not an activity they’re used to, the muscles of the rotator cuff can get inflamed.”\nYou Can’t Win ’Em All\nEven with precautions, you may still experience some pain while exercising. If so, ease off immediately. Apply ice for 15 to 20 minutes several times a day and\nelevate the injured area. Wrapping the area in an elastic bandage—compression—is recommended in many instances, including ankle sprains.\nAny injury that remains painful for more than two or three days should be examined by a physician. In some cases surgery may be necessary, but most overuse injuries can be treated with physical therapy. “Even if someone’s been injured, we want them to stay active,” LeMay says. Sometimes, he adds, it’s just a matter of finding a new activity.\nPlay Like a Winner\nWant to stay in the game without getting hurt? It’s as simple as taking the appropriate steps.\nReady: Make sure you have everything you need to participate safely in the sport. Do you know how to play it properly? Do you understand its physical demands? Do you have the right equipment—and is it still in good condition?\nSet: Exercise regularly and have a pre-season conditioning program to gradually build up strength, duration and fitness for specific disciplines. Take time to warm up before each session, whether by stretching or just starting out at a slower, easier pace.\nGo: Even if you’ve been injured, don’t\njust sit there. Reduce physical activity by about 50 percent and cross-train with other sports or exercises that don’t irritate the injured area. If you’re given physical rehabilitation exercises, keep doing them even after the injury has healed to maintain strength and conditioning.\nWhen “weekend warrior” activities get the best of you, you can rely on the OSU Sports Medicine Center's physicians for the best care.

5	I love watching fish in aquariums, but I'm worried about how noisy submarines might scare them away. Is there any new technology that lets us watch sea creatures without disturbing them?	Yes, there is a new eel larvae-like robot that can swim silently in salt water without using electric motors or noisy propellers. Unlike traditional rigid submarine-like vehicles, this robot uses artificial muscle-inspired chambers filled with conductive ionic solution similar to seawater for propulsion. It's virtually transparent and represents an important step toward observing marine life without disturbing or harming them. This innovation will enable collecting non-invasive biological and behavioral data of aquatic communities.	"[""An innovative, eel larvae-like robot developed by engineers and a marine biologist at the University of California can swim silently in salt water without an electric motor.\nInstead, the robot uses artificial muscle-inspired electrode chambers filled with a conductive ionic solution akin to seawater to propel itself. The foot-long robot, the first prototype of which is connected to an electronics board that remains on the surface, is also virtually transparent.\nThe team, which includes researchers from UC San Diego and UC Berkeley, detailed its work in the April 25 issue of Science Robotics. Researchers say the bot is an important step toward a future when soft robots can swim in the ocean alongside fish and invertebrates without disturbing or harming them. Today most underwater vehicles designed to observe marine life are rigid and submarine-like and powered by electric motors with noisy propellers.\n“This robot, inspired from biology, will provide a novel platform with which a whole new set of ‘un-disturbed, non-invasive’ biological and behavioural data of aquatic communities will be possible to record,” said Dimitri Deheyn, a marine biologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego and a member of the research team, “thus opening a new window of opportunities for ecosystem observation, understanding, and management.”\nOne key innovation was using the salt water in which the robot swims to help generate the electrical forces that propel it. The bot is equipped with cables that apply voltage to both the salt water surrounding it and to pouches of conductive water inside of its artificial muscles-like chambers. The robot’s electronics then deliver negative charges in the water just outside of the robot and positive charges inside of the robot that polarise the material and activate the muscle-like propulsion.\nAlternative changes of these electrical charges cause the artificial muscles to bend, generating the robot’s undulating swimming motion. The charges are located just outside the robot’s surface and carry very little current so they are safe for nearby marine life.\n“Our biggest breakthrough was the idea of using the environment as part of our design,” said Michael Tolley, the paper’s corresponding author and a professor of mechanical engineering at the Jacobs School at UC San Diego. “There will be more steps to creating an efficient, practical, untethered eel robot, but at this point we have proven that it is possible.”\nPreviously, other research groups had developed robots with similar technology. But to power these robots, engineers were using materials that need to be held in constant tension inside semi-rigid frames. The Science Robotics study shows that the frames are not necessary.\n“This is in a way the softest robot to be developed for underwater exploration,” Tolley said.\nThe robot was tested inside saltwater tanks filled with jellies, coral and fish at Birch Aquarium at Scripps and in Tolley’s lab.\nThe conductive chambers inside the robot’s artificial muscles were loaded with fluorescent dye to help researchers observe the robot’s activity. Deheyn said the fluorescence could serve an additional purpose in the future, being a mode of communications through which researchers activate or deactivate sensors within the robot.\nNext steps also include improving the robot’s reliability and its geometry. Researchers need to improve ballast, equipping the robot with weights so that it can dive deeper. For now, engineers have improvised ballast weights with a range of objects, such as magnets. In future work, researchers envision building a head for their eel robot to house a suite of sensors.\n“This robot is just the beginning and it has a bright future ahead, especially for communities currently difficult to observe using traditional means,” Deheyn said.\nThe best maritime site on the web.

6	Could you explain how Venice's churches reflect both the city's wealth and its social structure during its historical development?	Venice's churches, particularly the Basilica San Marco and Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, demonstrate the city's immense wealth through their ostentatious opulence, reflecting Venice's status as the greatest marketplace in the western world by the 15th century. The social structure is evident in how these churches served different classes - while aristocrats lived in luxury, working-class families actively participated in church life through scuole (confraternities or guilds) founded by Dominicans and Franciscans. These scuole, organized by trade or ethnic background, provided charitable services, granted dowries, distributed food to the poor, and supported widows and orphans, helping maintain social harmony between Venice's aristocrats and working class.	['Italy is justifiably famous for its natural beauty, compelling history, sumptuous foods and elegant culture. It’s also home to fascinating and magnificent churches and cathedrals, some of them the most famous in the world.\nIf you plan to visit Italy, we can guarantee you will see captivating churches. Even for seasoned travelers experienced in the majestic sights of Europe, churches in Italy are like nothing you’ve seen anywhere in the Old World.\nThe Duomo of Siena\nIt’s probably a fair claim that this is the most stunning cathedral in Italy. Construction lasted virtually half a century, from 1215 to 1263. What makes this cathedral incomparable is the exterior and interior design. You’ll find both decorated in stunning and contrasting colors of marble. That alone is enough of a reason to explore.\nIt’s a towering Romanesque-inspired church, adorned with works of art from timeless Italian artists who need no introduction, names like Michelangelo, Donatello, Pisano, Bernini and others.\nPerhaps the most magnificent feature of the cathedral is right under your feet.\nThe entire floor of Siena’s Cathedral is one of the most stunning works of art in all the world: a spectacular inlaid marble mosaic floor, described by art historian and artist Giorgio Vasari as “the most beautiful, largest and most magnificent floor that ever was made.”\nThis beautiful Gothic cathedral is the fifth largest in the world and the second largest in Italy. Taking more than 600 years to complete, it is acknowledged as a giant of Italian cathedrals. An interesting piece of its history is that the cathedral’s final completion was effectuated by the one and only Napoleon Bonaparte in 1805.\nThe French Emperor was so impressed that he ordered the cathedral finished and paid for by the French treasury. Napoleon was resolute that the cathedral be preserved.Today, with the effects of pollution, patrons are asked to adopt one of the gargoyles (used as drainage fixtures) that adorn that façade. Up for adoption are 135 gargoyles as of this writing. Perhaps your name will be inscribed below one of these eerie apparitions.\nBasilica San Marco in Venice\nThere are at least two things you’ll instantly notice about this cathedral. One is the very obvious influence of Western and Byzantine styles. Secondly is the ostentatious degree of opulence on display, signaling the vast wealth of Venice when Italy consisted of separate, smaller republics.\nGold tiles and mosaics adorn the walls, ceilings and arches inside the building. Outside, it’s the mosaic covered domes that are the focal point. Scenes from the façade exteriors include the life of Christ and the Day of Judgment. At the southwest corner of the basilica, you can meet the statue of Four Tetrarchs, the co-rulers of the Tetrarchy established by Roman authorities in the third century.\nThat these statues were stolen from Turkey during the Crusades is proven by the fact that one of the statues’ feet was found in Istanbul in the 1960s—where it is still on display.\nSt Peter’s Basilica in Rome\nThis stunning Renaissance church is prominently featured in Vatican City. Not only is this church stunning architecturally, having been designed by famous artists Michelangelo, Donato Bramante and Carlo Maderno, but it’s also one of the holiest sites in Christianity. This is where Saint Peter, the first Pope, is buried.\nIt is a unique shrine in Christianity. The basilica also holds the burial sites of other popes and notables, and often these are adorned with works of art.\nIt boasts further of the title of the world’s largest church. There are many stunning features, from the front façade to an interior adorned with mosaics, statues and marble columns.\nVisiting this cathedral is—by itself—full justification for visiting Italy. It is one of the greatest and most enduring ornaments on earth.\nBasilica of Saint Francis in Assisi\nLocated in the tranquil town of Assisi in the beautiful Umbria region, this basilica has particular significance in the Christian faith, often being used as part of a pilgrimage to honor the patron saint of Italy, St. Francis.\nThe most impressive aspect is its commanding location overlooking the bucolic town, like the spirit of the saint himself.\nThe upper part of this church is used to tell the story of St. Francis’ life with exquisitely decorated frescoes. The lower part of the church is used for religious services and rituals, so its tone and setting are more solemn.\nThe basilica sustained a violent earthquake in 1997. The church was closed for two years while restorations were made. Saint Francis himself is buried in the lower basilica, and if you descend to visit his grave, you will return home with your own “tale from the crypt.”\nThis is one of the most dazzling cathedrals in Italy. Construction began in the 13th century and wasn’t completed until the 15th century. You’ll find yourself awestruck by the frescoes designed by Giorgio Vasari and by the mosaic tiles that line the floors of the interiors.\nThe first thing that will grab your attention is the exterior of this building with its pink, white and green marble and 44 stained glass windows. You can also ascend to the top of Brunelleschi’s dome for an opulent and panoramic view of the entire city.\nThe bell tower is another distinctive feature. If you listen closely enough, maybe you can hear the distant echoes of the preachings of Savanorola. At the very top of the dome, there is a bronze ball that was worked on in 1600 by a young apprentice that you may have heard of: Leonardo da Vinci.\nSanta Maria Assunta in Positano\nThe Santa Maria Assunta is located in the idyllic town of Positano on the incomparable Amalfi Coast. This church is definitely the most significant landmark in the town. Its position integrates perfectly into the hilly landscape that surrounds this town. This is a very romantic church in the region, famous for its many weddings.\nThe beautiful and large multi-colored dome is the most majestic feature, while also notable is the presence of a black Madonna. Legend has it that the icon from Byzantium was stolen. While being transported across the Mediterranean by pirates, the legend continues, a fierce storm kicked up, prompting the statue to speak, “Put down. Put down.” As the precious icon was loaded and transported to a small fishing village, the storm abated.\nMiracle? You decide.\nSanta Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, Venice\nVenice has more than its fair share of awe-inspiring churches, this being among the most prominent. Its exterior is a little more subdued than other churches in Italy.\nWhat does make this church impressive is the vast amount and diversity of artwork inside. Some of the most stunning art ever produced by Italian artists resides for all time within this church.\nThink of artworks by artists like Titian, Antonio Canova, Donatello and more. This alone is reason to put a visit to Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari on your bucket list.\nThis is arguably the most beautiful cathedral in Amalfi. The most striking feature of this cathedral is the steep flight of 62 stairs and the Arab-influenced exterior culminating in the main entrance.\nThe interior is also a sight to behold. Just inside the front entrance is a 13th century wooden crucifix and toward the back is a crucifix made of mother-of-pearl.\nThere is an interesting story around the crypt here. The crypt contains the relix—human remains—of St. Andrew, an apostle who knew Jesus personally. Mystery and conflict swirl around how his remains ended up here.\nItaly has an abundance of most beautiful churches in the world, too many to mention here! But if you are traveling in Italy with limited time, the ones described above are a small but satisfying taste of humanity’s richest art and architecture.', 'Some say Venice is the most beautiful city ever built by man, and it\nis certainly one of the marvels of Christendom. Situated in a marshy\nlagoon off the mainland of northern Italy, its inaccessibility\nattracted the city’s founders, who sought refuge from the barbarians\nwho invaded their mainland homes. The invaders were from central Asia\nand many could neither sail nor swim. It is here in the shallow lagoon\nof the sixth century that the magnificent city was born. The islands\nupon which Venice stands became home to aristocratic refugees, and\nlater a more modest working class.\nBy the 15th century the island city became the greatest marketplace\nin the western world and the primary port of entry in Europe for food\nand merchandise from Arabia, China, and India. Europeans traveled from\nfar and near to buy spices, gold, oil, animals, jewels, tin, copper,\nivory, ebony, paintings and mosaics in Venice. The center of the\nmarketplace was the Rialto, which Shakespeare used as his setting in\nThe Merchant of Venice.\nLong before the founding of the city, however, St. Mark is said to\nhave traveled to the north of Italy and founded the first Christian\ncommunity there. When he was traveling back to Rome by sea, his ship\nstopped at the islands which would one day become Venice. An angel\nappeared to him saying “Pax tibi, Marce, evangelista meus. Hic\nrequiescet corpus tuum” (Peace unto you, Mark, my Evangelist. Here your\nbody will rest).\nAlthough St. Mark traveled on to become Bishop of Alexandria in\nEgypt and died there, two merchants returned to Venice from Alexandria\nin A.D. 828, bringing with them the body of St. Mark. Venice then\nadopted as its mascot a winged lion, which is the traditional artistic\nsymbol of St. Mark. The lion is always depicted gripping a book marked\nwith the angel’s words Pax Tibi Marce Evangelista Mei.\nIn the centuries following, the Lion of St. Mark was to become\nubiquitous in Venice; it was displayed on everything from the great\ncathedral down to the handles of daggers and the covers of prayer\nbooks. Throughout the sixteenth century Venetian architects and city\nplanners worked with artists and craftsmen to create a city that was\nthought to be a work of art. The heart of this masterpiece was the\nshrine that eventually became St. Mark’s Cathedral. Its piazza is one\nthe most famous public square in the world: Piazza San Marco.\nThe finding of the relics\nSan Marco Cathedral\noriginal St. Mark’s Church was destroyed by a fire in A.D. 976. After\nthe fire Venetians searched the ruble for the relics of St. Mark’s\nbody, but it could not be found. When the new basilica was completed, a\nsolemn fast was called and prayers were offered in hopes that the lost\nrelics would be revealed. On June 25,1063, as a procession moved\nthrough the new basilica, a bright light suddenly shone from a pillar\nnear the altar of St. James. Part of the wall of masonry fell away, and\na sweet fragrance filled the church. It was here that the body of St.\nMark was rediscovered. It had been bricked into the wall by a careless\ntraditionally known as a city of aristocrats who have lived in luxury\nsince the tenth century, but the working men of Venice and their\nfamilies were the great contributors to Catholic life and society.\nWhile many of the aristocrats idled their time away on superficial\npleasures, the renaissance working man labored hard to support his\nfamily, yet was rewarded more than adequately by generous employers.\nReligion played an important role in the life of a Venetian worker,\nand all working-class families went to Church each week and took part\nin the many Church festivals. Assisting the workers in stable family\nand work life were the scuole (plural of scuola, literally meaning\n“school”) — confraternities or guilds founded by the Dominicans and the\nFranciscans after their arrival in the 13th century. Although the\nscuole were founded by priests they existed as charitable fraternities\nof laymen grouped together either by trade — gondoliers, shipyard\nworkers, painters, fishermen, etc.—or according to ethnic background —\nthere was one for Armenians, one for the Greeks, one for the Slavs, one\nfor the Albanians, and so forth.\nSince the workers of medieval and Renaissance Venice had no\npolitical input, the scuole became a substitute for political activity.\nThe members of each scuola elected their own officers and paid annual\ndues. Each scuola also devoted itself to a particular saint and each\nperformed a particular work of charity throughout the year. The scuole\ngranted girls’ dowries, distributed sacks of flour to the poor, gave\npensions to widows and the elderly, and provided for orphans. They also\nserved as friendly social societies, which celebrated the feast days of\ntheir patron saints with grand pageants.\nThese scuole provided small communities for the Venetian working\nclass people, it strengthened their family life and supported one\nanother through tough times, it helped educate the children and\nstrengthened the faith of its lay members. Unlike many other areas of\nEurope which experienced great strife due to a clash between the rich\naristocracy and the poor working-class, Venice was remarkably free from\nstrikes, riots and revolutions. Aristocrats, who usually paid the wages\nto the working man, were cordial to the lower classes and the working\nmen were respectful of the aristocracy.\nJesuits of Venice\nSanta Maria Cathedral\nthe Catholic Counter-Reformation, a period of decadence set in\nthroughout Europe. Venice was not spared. The Church at that time was\nforced to establish criteria for the production of art and books. The\nChurch implemented strict regulations on the Catholic people—almost all\nVenetians were Catholic—to protect them from falling into grave habits\nof personal sin. This was exemplified by the Society of Jesus, which\nwas founded in A.D. 1540 by St. Ignatius of Loyola to combat the rise\nof Protestantism and to reform the intellectual and moral life of the\nThe Jesuit order was organized as a spiritual army, and its soldiers\nwere found in every school, university, library, courtroom and church\nthrough the city. Highly disciplined, the Jesuits attracted outstanding\nmen to their ranks. They soon came to dominate the intellectual life of\nVenice and were very influential through the city. Although they were\nan excellent influence upon the working-class of Venice, the\naristocrats had no trouble ignoring them in their complete turning away\nis still considered to be one of the most beautiful cities in the\nworld. However, due to its precarious siting on a marshy lagoon, the\nfoundations of the city are deteriorating. Some 40% of Venice’s\nbuildings are uninhabited because they are too expensive to upkeep;\nmany are simply eroding.\nIn 1966, Venice was hit by a major flood that destroyed many of the\nbuildings in Venice. On the evening of November 3 of that year water\nbegan to spill over into the streets and piazzas of the city. Venetians\nwere not alarmed, however, because they were used to the natural high\ntide to spill a little water into the streets. What did alarm them was\nthat when the time for ebb tide came the waters did not recede. Five\nhours later another high tide flooded the city even deeper, and\neventually the streets of Venice were flooded with more than six feet\nof water, the city’s highest flood in recorded history.\nTwenty-four hours later relief came: the water began receding — not\nslowly as it usually did, but rapidly, with the force of a miracle.\nWithin three hours all of the flood water was sucked out to sea and\nVenetians once again were able to walk on pavement.\nSince then Venetians have become more conscious of the vulnerability\nof their city. Many efforts have been undertaken over the past decades\nto “save” the city through conservation efforts. But whatever the fate\nof Venice is, the city will always be known as the work of art built\nupon the mudflats of lagoon islands and dedicated to St. Mark the']	['<urn:uuid:b1669247-f7d3-4d34-aead-51664a337add>', '<urn:uuid:2c29ad62-12ed-4db8-bf2b-6c0338b2599c>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	19	105	2630
7	worried about allergies getting worse why is pollen season stronger and longer these days	The intensity and duration of pollen season has increased due to climate change. Rising carbon dioxide levels have led to increased plant reproduction and higher total pollen levels, particularly in plants that thrive in high CO2 concentrations. For instance, ragweed pollen concentrations are predicted to increase fourfold in the next 30 years. Additionally, more frequent thunderstorms caused by rising sea temperatures increase pollen grain concentrations at ground level, which can trigger severe asthmatic symptoms in people with asthma or hay fever.	['The changes in the environment and biodiversity brought on by climate change could be responsible for increases in allergies, autoimmune diseases and autism, according to a Rutgers researcher\nClimate change and disruption of the ecosystem have the potential to profoundly impact the human body. Xue Ming, professor of neurology at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, who recently published a paper in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health on the effects of climate change on allergies, autoimmunity and the microbiome — the beneficial microorganisms that live on and inside the human body — discusses how the delicate balance of the environment affects conditions such as allergies, autism and immune disorders.\nHow has climate change affected respiratory allergies?\nClimate change has worsened respiratory allergic disease and has altered the immune system’s tolerance in responding to toxins, which has led to an increase in the prevalence of immune diseases. People with chronic respiratory allergic disease that affects the nose and eyes, such as asthma and allergies, are at particular risk due to increased exposure to pollen and the increased concentration and distribution of air pollutants.\nAccording to the American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology, climate change has both increased the intensity of the pollen season as well as prolonged its duration. Increases in carbon dioxide were shown to lead to an increase in plant reproduction and total pollen levels, especially those plants that thrive at high carbon dioxide concentrations. For example, ragweed pollen has been increasing in concentration, with models predicting that levels will increase by four times within the next 30 years.\nThunderstorms, which have become more frequent due to rising sea temperatures, have been found to increase concentrations of pollen grains at ground level. After absorbing water, these grains can rupture and release allergenic particles that can induce severe asthmatic symptoms in patients with asthma or hay fever.\nClimate change has also been linked to increased concentrations and distribution of air pollutants such as ozone, nitric oxide and other volatile organic chemicals. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that these airborne environmental pollutants may be partially responsible for the substantial increase in allergic respiratory disease seen in industrialized countries over the past several decades.\nHow do changes to the ecosystem affect allergies and respiratory disorders?\nDeforestation and over-logging have led to a dramatic decrease in the diversity of plant species. As one species of plant becomes extinct, new species emerge to take their place. For example, as oak trees have been excessively harvested for architectural purposes, new species of trees have emerged. With these new trees come new forms of tree pollen, which are inhaled and ingested by humans on a daily basis.\nSimilarly, widespread pesticide use has altered the profile of insects, invertebrates and microorganisms with which we come into contact with through our soil and vegetation. As the environment is altered, our bodies are bombarded with novel organisms. The molecules which make up these organisms — known as antigens — are recognized as “foreign” by our bodies and create an inflammatory response.\nHow might a loss of biodiversity due to climate change affect non-respiratory diseases?\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, biodiversity is declining faster than at any time in human history, with nearly 1 million animal and plant species are threatened with extinction due to climate change.\nThe loss of biodiversity related to climate change may affect the microbiome, potentially leading to inflammatory, autoimmune and neurologic diseases. Immunologic disorders, such as food allergies, are on the rise. For example, several studies have found that increases in carbon dioxide and temperature are correlated with changes in the composition of the peanut, making it more difficult for the body to adapt immunity.\nCould disturbances in gut bacteria affect the autism rate?\nDisruption of gut bacteria has been linked to neurologic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, autism and Parkinson’s disease. In my own research, I found abnormal amino acid metabolism, increased imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body, and altered gut microbiomes among some patients with autism spectrum disorder.\nWhat steps can be taken to minimize the health risks brought on by climate change?\nWe must end the destruction of our natural environment, decrease emissions of greenhouse gases and adopt more “green” behavior. With research demonstrating links between the microbiome and autoimmune, inflammatory and neurologic diseases, it is critical that we minimize antimicrobial exposure. This may involve altering guidelines for the prescription of antibiotics by medical professionals. In addition, given that the microbiome is directly impacted by our daily environment it is important to regularly immerse ourselves in nature and familiarize ourselves with biodiverse surroundings.']	['<urn:uuid:f5f4dab1-d6c9-4ae1-8c15-31eaefd5e769>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	14	81	777

Research found that a compound called diallyl sulfide in garlic was 100 times more effective than two popular antibiotics for fighting intestinal infections. Studies demonstrated garlic supplementation reduces cold infection chances by 60% and cuts cold duration from 5 days to 1.5 days. Human studies also found garlic compounds were as effective as Atenolol at reducing blood pressure when taken in high doses. Additionally, garlic supplements reduced total and LDL cholesterol by 10-15%. In one human study of lead-exposed workers, garlic reduced blood lead levels by 19% and decreased toxicity symptoms.

This mineral is essential for bone health and your body’s nervous system.\n- The same size serving contains 36% of your daily fiber needs.\n- You can also get a decent amount (15-22% DV) of other vitamins and minerals from coconut including iron, phosphorous, potassium, copper, and selenium.\n- Because coconut is low in carbs but high in fat and fiber, it may help stabilize your blood sugar.\n- Phenolic compounds are found in coconut meat, which are antioxidants that help protects cells.\nKeep in mind that because coconut is so high in fat, it’s also high in calories at 354 in a 1 cup serving.\nBoth honey and agave nectar are natural sweeteners that are less refined than white sugar. They’re sweeter than sugar and are becoming a popular alternative to it. One isn’t necessarily healthier than the other, but they each have their differences. Let’s take a look at some key facts:\nGarlic has been used for thousands of years for its health and medicinal properties. The Greeks, Chinese, Romans, and Egyptians all knew there was something about garlic that made it special. Here are just some of the health benefits of garlic:\n•Powerful antibiotic - Diallyl sulfide, a compound in garlic, was found to be 100 times more effective than two popular antibiotics in fighting off intestinal infections.\n•Combat colds - Garlic supplementation can reduce the chance of catching a cold by 60% and reduce the length of having a cold if you do catch one from 5 days to 1.5 days.\n•Very nutritious but low in calories - One clove of garlic contains only 4.5 calories but is rich in vitamins C and B6 and manganese. It also contains trace amounts of other nutrients like copper, calcium, potassium, and iron.\n•Lower blood pressure - Human studies found that the active compounds in garlic were just as effective as the drug Atenolol at reducing blood pressure when taken in high daily doses (the equivalent of 4 cloves per day but as supplements).\n•Improve cholesterol levels - Garlic supplements were able to reduce total and LDL cholesterol by about 10–15%.\n•Heavy metal detox - In a human study of workers exposed to high levels of lead, garlic reduced lead levels in the blood by 19%. It also lowered symptoms of toxicity, such as headaches and high blood pressure.\nEverybody has a preference for when a banana is perfect. But does the nutrition of a banana change as it goes from green and firm to brown and soft? In short, yes. Let’s take a look at what happens:\n🍌Starch and Sweetness - Green bananas are full of complex carbohydrates and as they ripen they’re broken down into simple sugars which makes them sweeter.\n🍌Glycemic Index - A riper banana that has lower starch content and a higher amount of sugar can be digested quicker, but that means it’s higher on the Glycemic Index.\n🍌Antioxidant Levels - The brown spots on a ripe banana are from the chlorophyll breaking down into antioxidants. Green bananas do not have these antioxidant properties.\n🍌Calories - Even though lots of other things change, the calories stay the same in a banana whether it’s green, yellow, or brown.\n🍌Digestion - A ripe banana is easier to digest, but a more green banana is higher in resistant starches that you can’t digest and act as prebiotics.\n🍌Potassium - Potassium amounts pretty much stay the same regardless of the ripeness of a banana.\n🍌Vitamins and Minerals - Micronutrients like vitamin C, thiamin, and folic acid decrease as a banana ripens.\nEarlier this week we talked about the difference between probiotics and prebiotics. Now let’s look at what you can eat and drink to take in these helpful bacteria and their own food sources.\n• Probiotics (note that most are fermented in some way):\n- Traditional Fermented Buttermilk\n- Fermented Cheeses, such as Gouda\n• Prebiotics (these contain the fiber that feeds probiotics):\n- Legumes, Beans and Peas\n- Jerusalem Artichokes (not the same as regular artichokes)\n- Dandelion greens\nKeeping your gut bacteria balanced can affect many different aspects of your health. To maintain this balance, it’s important to eat a mix of things called probiotics and prebiotics. Let’s look at what each of them are and why they matter:\n•Probiotics - These are live, beneficial bacteria found in certain foods and supplements.\n•Prebiotics - These are substances that come from types of fiber you eat that feed the friendly bacteria in the digestive system. You aren’t able to digest them, but probiotics can so they both work together.\n•Put more simply - Probiotics are helpful bacteria you eat/drink. Prebiotics are food for the probiotic bacteria.\n•Why does it matter? Proper gut health can lead to improved overall digestive function, mental health, a reduced need for antibiotics, less sick days from colds, less yeast infections, and a decrease in eczema symptoms.\nLast week we showed you some quick ways to cut out 100 calories and now we’re back with 10 more:\n1. Sandwiches - try skipping the top piece of bread and see if you really miss it\n2. Milk - change from whole milk to 1% or even nonfat\n3. Yogurt - switch to Greek yogurt instead of the whole fat variety\n4. Cream cheese - go with low-fat cream cheese instead of full fat\n5. Coffee flavorings - if you usually used syrup for a flavor boost in your coffee, try sprinkling some cinnamon and nutmeg on it instead\n6. Jam - try an all-fruit variety of jam instead of the traditional kind that’s full of sugar\n7. Omelets - instead of filling your omelet with meat and cheese, load up on veggies like spinach and mushrooms\n8. Peanut butter - if you usually use two spoonfuls, try and get by with one\n9. Skip the cheese - instead of a slice of cheese, top your burger with tomato, onion, and pickle and see if you notice the missing cheese\n10. Spicy mayo - switch spicy mayo out for hot sauce (most varieties of hot sauce are 0 calories)\nSummer has flown by and it’s already time for school to start again. Food can do lots of things for your body and boosting brain health is just one of them. Here are some of the best foods to improve memory and brain function to keep you and your scholars at their peak school performance:\n💡 fatty/oily fish\n💡 berries (strawberries, blackberries, blueberries)\n💡 nuts/seeds (sunflower, almonds, hazelnuts, pumpkin)\nIt may not sound like much, but 100 calories are pretty easy to cut if you make some simple adjustments. Think about them adding up throughout the days, weeks, and months and you’ll see why it’s worth it. Here are 10 ways to cut 100 calories:\n1. Tuna - go with tuna packed in water instead of oil\n2. Skip the cone - get your ice cream in a cup instead of a cone\n3. Cake - pieces of cake from the middle of a sheet cake only have frosting on top instead of the top and sides\n4. Dessert toppings - instead of covering your desserts with whip cream or syrup, try fresh fruit like blueberries\n5. One less soda - try replacing one of your daily sodas with water\n6. Frozen fruit - go with frozen grapes or watermelon instead of popsicles or ice cream\n7. Mustard - try yellow mustard in place of honey mustard or make your own version with reduced honey\n8. Snack sizes - don’t eat snacks straight from the bag; pour into a bowl for portion control\n9. Baked chips - go with baked instead of the usual fried\n10. Canned fruit - look for varieties packed in natural juice instead of heavy syrup or just go with fresh']	['<urn:uuid:7aed2ae7-dbbb-49e6-8808-f1663e3e8ccb>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	7	99	1368

10	whats temperature like french islands pacific	The average temperature in French Polynesia is 27 degrees Celsius (80 degrees Fahrenheit) throughout the year.	"['Tahiti and its islands, a paradise hidden away in the heart of the Pacific\nIn the middle of the South Pacific, Tahiti and its islands make up the largest marine territory in the world, covering an area of 5.5 million square kilometres (equivalent to the land area of Europe). The land above the sea only represents 4,000 km2 spread over 118 islands and 5 archipelagos: the Marquesas (to the north), the Society Islands and the Tuamotu (in the centre), the Austral Islands (to the south) and the Gambier (to the southeast). Each archipelago has a unique landscape, from the green volcanic islands, to the turquoise blue coral atolls.\n""Ia Ora na"", ""Maeva"" and ""Manava"", three words of welcome: this is how the Polynesians greet their visitors. This legendary hospitality is symbolically shown on your arrival at the airport, by songs accompanied by guitars and ukuleles, and the gift of a Tahitian flower, the emblem of Tahiti and her islands. The multi-racial population of Tahiti and the islands includes Polynesians (83%, of which approximately 20% are of mixed race), Europeans (12%, principally from mainland France) and Chinese (5%, a community which settled here at the end of the nineteenth century). It is a melting pot that has shaped the contemporary Polynesian identity and culture.\nWith its turquoise lagoons, its islands surrounded by sparkling white-sand beached, its magical atmosphere, Tahiti and the surrounding islands attract many couples looking for a romantic holiday. Ardent fans of romantic love will take the first major step in their life together, whether by marriage or just a union, in this wonderful setting: the traditional Tahitian wedding ceremony is definitely one of the most beautiful gifts for future couples or newly-weds, on their honeymoon, to renew their vows, or simply celebrate an anniversary.\nSince 2009, a new law has made it easier for foreigners to get legally married in French Polynesia: the future couple can get married legally without having to live in the territory before the wedding, provided they make sure that a sworn interpreter is present, that they inform the consulate of their country, and they submit their request in the town concerned one month in advance.\nBeyond the mythical white sandy beaches, Tahiti and her islands have many rich resources: well-preserved flora and fauna with many endemic species (40% local species), and an incredible variety of landscapes. The authorities have, in the last few years, started encouraging ""green"" tourist activities, to discover a lesser-known Polynesia. Green tourism is on the rise, with marked footpaths, guided hiking tours and guide associations, and adventurous tourists keen on exploring nature in Polynesia have access to a wide range of activities: hiking, treks in a bivouac, excursions, canyoning, and even eco-tours organised by marine biology specialists.\nDiving is another “must”. According to divers, there is no better place in the world to see such a wide variety of sea beds, whether you dive in the lagoons, around the mountain islands, the lower lying islands, or around the atolls. In almost all the main islands - Tahiti, Moorea, Bora Bora, Huahine, Raiatea and Tahaa, in the Tuamotu Islands, the Marquesas and even in the Austral Islands, from the smallest to the largest, a large number of clubs have been created.\nAmongst the caves and the rocky depths, from lagoons to reefs, divers swim amongst spectacular coral formations and discover red sponges, multicoloured polyps, gorgonia or luxurious gardens of all sorts of anemone, where schools of angel or butterfly fish, blue fin Trevally, clouds of silver and gold are formed by thousands of fish. The whole range of tropical underwater fauna is here: parrot fish, clown fish, butterfly fish, blue tang fish, triggerfish, morays, eagle rays and mantas. There are some impressive encounters: dolphins, manta rays, turtles and even barracudas.\nThe main attraction for the public, in all the islands, remains diving with sharks, the principal (and Pacific...) stars of each outing. The most spectacular diving is found in the passages of the Tuamotu Islands, particularly that of Rangiroa (but also at Fakarava or Tikehau), considered as the Mecca of deep sea diving.\nIn French Polynesia, don’t miss:\n- Society Islands (Tahiti, Moorea, Bora Bora, Huahine, Raiatea, Tahaa, Maupiti): swimming, nature, culture, romanticism, diving.\n- Tuamotu Archipelago (Rangiroa, Fakarava, Manihi, Tikehau): diving, romanticism, swimming.\n- Marqueseas Islands (Nuku Hiva, Hiva Oa): nature, culture.\n- Tubuai (or Austral) Islands (Rurutu): diving with whales, culture, nature.\n- Gambier Islands (Mangareva): authenticity, culture.\nMain city: Papeete\nVisa formalities :\nCitizens of the European Union, the European Economic Area, Andorra, Monaco, and Switzerland, must present on entry a return ticket and a passport valid for six months after that departure date, but do not need a preliminary visa. Citizens from other countries must obtain a visa in advance from the French embassy or consulate in their place of residence. The visa must explicitly state that it is ‘Valid for French Polynesia’. If transiting through the United States, which is usually the case, travellers must be in possession of a passport that meets U.S. norms, and must contact the nearest U.S. consulate in order to discover if there are potential visa formalities required. Ever since 12 January 2009, all passengers on flights from Paris to Papeete that connect through Los Angeles, must register with the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), by filling out a questionnaire on the internet at least 72 hours prior to departure.\nTime-zone difference with respect to Paris: 11 hours in winter, 12 hours in summer.\nCurrency: French Pacific franc (CFP). The exchange rate is permanently set at 1 euro = 119.33 CFP.\nTemperature: Average 27 C° (80° F)\nThere are flights from Europe to Tahiti-Faa International Airport several times a week. Both Air France and Air Tahiti Nui fly from Paris and connect through Los Angeles. It is also possible to fly to Tahiti from other major European airports, via Los Angeles. Air New Zealand operates flights from London and Frankfurt to Los Angeles, with connecting Air Tahiti Nui flights to Tahiti. The entire trip takes 22 hours with the possibility of a stop-over in Los Angeles (see details with each airline). It is also possible to get to Tahiti from Sydney, Australia (Air Tahiti Hui, Air New Zealand, and QANTAS), and Tokyo/Osaka, Japan (Air Tahiti Nui).']"	['<urn:uuid:e2b1472b-c25f-4771-8fbf-226a3796d8de>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	6	16	1047
11	What happened to research projects during Covid lockdowns?	During the Covid-19 pandemic, many research projects had to adapt from in-person to remote work. Researchers continued their work by using previously collected materials such as data, sound recordings, photos, and videos. While this posed some challenges for site-specific work, it also provided opportunities to view projects from a different perspective and put them in a wider context. In some cases, the pandemic actually strengthened commitments to ongoing relationships despite spatial and temporal distance, as people found new ways to maintain connections remotely.	['Interview with transdisciplinary studio FoAM Earth\nIn 2017, shortly after founding FoAM Earth, Maja Kuzmanovic and Nik Gaffney travelled to Seili as part of the Spectres in Change pilot project. The initial retreat, shared with fellow artists and curators, sparked new relationships and conversations as well as an interest in returning to the island to actively engage with its gentle shifts and murmurings. In 2019, FoAM Earth participated in their second retreat in Seili, Spectres of Landings, this time combining their visit with a research residency. Kuzmanovic and Gaffney describe FoAM Earth as a nomadic studio within the FoAM network which explores futurecrafting as a way of re-enchanting the present. The studio creates propositions, immersive situations and experiences and cultivates kinship networks and circumstances for conviviality and collaboration.\nAhead of the How do you know what you know? Exercises in Attentiveness event on Friday 12th and Saturday 13th August – where FoAM Earth’s new sound walk, Post Glacial Rebound, will be premiered – Selina Oakes interviews Kuzmanovic and Gaffney to ask about the ways in which their extended engagements with Seili have filtered into the studio’s working practices and projects.\nWhat have you been working on since your last visit to Seili?\nFoAM: Our last visit to Seili was in May 2019. We had planned to return during 2020 and continue working on a site-specific soundwalk. Although these plans were interrupted by the pandemic, our conversations with the curators continued online and we gradually adapted our plans from situated to remote. During our residency on Seili, we compiled a motley collection of data, sound recordings, photos and videos, so we were able to continue working with the traces, sounds and fragments of the island without being there physically ourselves. Taru Elfving, Lotta Petronella and Kalle Hamm have shared new maps, sounds and images with us, and we are finding ways to adapt and work with more recent changes on the island.\nOur current work and upcoming soundwalk, Post Glacial Rebound, is part of Resonances – a series of sonic propositions concerned with listening to the sounds of the Earth unfolding at different timescales and in different landscapes. Within Resonances, we collect, reflect and reshape the oscillations of earthbound entities to create soundscapes using field recordings and digital synthesis. Since our last visit to Seili, we have continued working with the Resonances series in two contrasting environments: the arid Sonoran and Mojave deserts in the USA, and the tropical urban jungle of Singapore. In Arizona, we produced the Dust & Shadow project which included a soundwalk and an immersive experience set in a library, while in Singapore, we recorded and composed soundscapes during the first “circuit-breaker” (to curb the spread of Covid-19) for listeners to experience, from wherever they happened to be situated, during lockdown. Some of these soundscapes are available via bandcamp.\nAside from Resonances, we have also been working on the Anarchive, a sprawling multi-sensory publication looking at FoAM’s multi-decade existence and focusing particularly on the ideas and practices which remain fertile and could offer hope amid the uncertainty of the near-now.\nHow has working in Seili and with CAA contributed to your artistic work in general?\nFoAM: CAA’s ways of thinking about the arts, environment and climate change resonate closely with ours. The process-based and multi-year engagement with CAA, the Archipelago Research Institute and Seili has allowed us to deepen our relationship with the place and people involved. This influences our artistic work, both on the island and more broadly. Through our experiences on Seili, we met several kindred spirits and found many opportunities through which to learn and share. In our Spectres in Change fieldnotes (fieldnotes #1 and fieldnotes #2), we wrote about how the project’s focus on different practices of landing and attentiveness encouraged us to reflect on how we approach new places and unfamiliar contexts when working nomadically. Working on Seili gave us an opportunity to further develop our capacities to listen and observe, sense and attune, and share stories and experiences.\nWe have been inspired both by the history and ecology of the island, and the people involved – the CAA curators, the artists and scientists on Seili. We appreciate the experimental process and long-term engagement encouraged by the project, as well as the artful combination of reflective retreats and informal socialising. Spending more time on the island during our residency in 2019 allowed us to experience it’s more-than-human qualities. The residency inspired a more intimate connection with the landscape and its inhabitants, which we found essential to deepen our work on and around Seili.\nHow can art and science converse on the topic of climate change? What kind of new layers has working in Seili brought to the conversation?\nFoAM: Both art and science can provide different, yet complementary approaches to how we understand, respond to, and live with climate change. Conversations grounded in shared concerns can develop in ways that may be impossible otherwise. The physical science of climate change is well understood and the IPCC Assessment Reports are substantial contributions to human understanding. However, impacts, adaptation and mitigation are complex, difficult issues that demand creativity and social engagement as much as policy changes and data collection.\nArtists and scientists share a curiosity about the world, even if their methods and techniques may sometimes differ. With a broad, respectful engagement, different approaches can have reciprocal benefits, whether climate change is seen as a subject, a situation, or an emergency. Conversations and collaborations can lead to deeper understanding and more viable action.\nOur visits to Seili enabled us to immerse ourselves in work and life at the Archipelago Research Institute, to converse with scientists in lecture halls, in the field, during lunch, sauna or evening drinks. Spending time together with the scientists in their ‘habitat’ offered insights into their research questions, methodologies and results. The close connections between the researchers, the archipelago and its inhabitants (human, vegetal, animal…) have added more situated, personal layers to the conversation. The many layers of history and geology co-existing on the island have contributed to the depth and breadth of these conversations.\nYou mentioned that experimental processes and long-term engagements inspire you. Could you tell more about how this shows in your working methods?\nFoAM: Most of FoAM’s work finds some grounding in experimental processes. This could include elements such as questioning the status quo, learning from different stakeholders, articulating hypotheses, designing artworks as public experiments, reflecting on the creative process and sharing results using open (re)source principles. These aspects vary depending on the people involved and what the situation calls for, and the content, formats and outcomes can also take on many forms. Often we begin with a small experiment, or hypothesis, or inkling, which develops as a project through iterations. This kind of work benefits from long term engagement of everyone involved. Unexpected results can take things in unexpected directions. Some examples of our process-based work include Dust and Shadow, Tasting Tomorrow, or Marine CoLab.\nWe are approaching our work on Seili in a similar manner. The first visit was something like an initiation — getting to know the environment, people and other entities involved. We documented this process in photographs and text. The second visit was more concentrated: we began attuning to the place through listening, recording, exploring alongside talking with the researchers on the island and following their experiments. We collected time series data, sound and visual material to work with, and documented the process on our blog, website and wiki. The next cycle includes sound composition, working with the sonification of time series data, and developing a soundwalk on the island.\nIn the longer term, we’ve discussed finding possible answers to the question “what could climate change in the archipelago taste like?” through creating an experimental meal. We’ve talked about how artistic and scientific work can provide insight into ongoing research, or take it in new directions. But, as with any speculative, or long-term processes, these plans will change shape through further engagements with the people involved, the island and its (spectral) inhabitants.\nDue to Covid-19-related delays, there has been a pause in your on-site engagement with Seili. How have your plans for the island changed over the course of a few years, and what has this ‘break’ afforded you?\nFoAM: The ‘great pause’ of the pandemic enabled us to deepen our relationship with CAA and Seili remotely. It also afforded us some distance from the island itself, which has been helpful to put the project in a wider context of accelerated climate change and the tangible threat of ongoing pandemics. Experiencing the global effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the multitude of responses has increased our appreciation of the Archipelago Research Institute’s longterm research on ticks and the spread of tick-born diseases.\nInstead of continuing with the situated research trips – planned at various intervals between 2017-2022 – we have been working with the materials collected on the island in 2019. We noticed that we are paying more attention to the recorded materials on both their own terms and in terms of relating them to the changing contexts around Seili. The work is becoming more of a prefiguration, or a yearning, maybe even an homage to a place that we care about but where we could not return.\nHowever, working on a site-specific soundwalk without being on-site of course poses some challenges. We were unable to experience how the island has changed with the rise of tourism in recent years. The route we mapped for the soundwalk will look and sound different. The ideas we had three years ago still feel just as resonant, but their implementation has needed some simplification to allow us to create the work remotely.\nBeing physically away from the island and the people hasn’t affected our motivation to continue with the engagement. The conversations with CAA and finding different opportunities for collaboration has strengthened our commitment to an ongoing relationship, despite the spatial and temporal distance. In a way, living through the ebbs-and-flows of the pandemic, while keeping the remote connection alive, has caused the relational distance to shrink.\nRead more about FoAM Earth’s Spectres in Change activities: https://fo.am/activities/spectres-in-change/']	['<urn:uuid:e629ec62-3482-4a1c-a62b-428b33244940>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	8	83	1693
12	anxiety treatment options online offline resources	Anxiety can be managed through various therapeutic techniques, including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, and Mindfulness practices. Sometimes medication may be helpful. For online support, there are apps like Tide for sleep and meditation, and Mind Shift CBT for developing healthy thought patterns. Professional help can be accessed either through traditional in-person therapy or online therapy platforms, which studies have shown to be equally effective. It's important to note that anxiety is a common condition, with music industry workers experiencing up to 10 times the rate of moderate to severe anxiety compared to the general population.	['WHAT IS ANXIETY?\nAnxiety is a feeling of fear or worry – it’s a normal human reaction to a threatening situation, but if it gets out of hand or exists as part of an illness it can cause real problems.\nPeople working in the music industry experience up to 10x the rate of moderate to severe anxiety compared to people in general, and there are lots of things about working in the industry that contribute to that.\ncommon TYPES of anxiety in MUSIC\nFeeling anxious about performing to the point where it interferes with your ability or willingness to perform.\nAnxiety in social situation, being overly worried about what people will think of you which can make it hard to network\nThis is a personality trait but can be associated with anxiety, about creating and releasing work for example\nOthers include obsessive compulsive disorder – when you have repetitive, unwanted thoughts and you feel compelled to do things to get rid of them. Or post traumatic stress disorder which can occur after a very traumatic experience. In some cases, anxiety can lead to panic attacks – when it can feel like you can’t breathe, your heart is beating fast and you think you are losing control, amongst other things.\nWhat does anxiety look & feel like?\nA GP or registered psychologist might recognise anxiety as a problem for you if you’ve regularly experienced a range of the following over a six month period:\n- Persistent worry about things that are out of proportion to their potential impact\n- Perceiving situations, events and people as threatening, even when they aren’t\n- Constant overthinking, catastrophising and imaging worst-case scenarios\n- Inability to set aside worry, relax and calm down\n- Difficultly concentrating, focusing and feeling like the mind “goes blank”\n- Muscle tension or aches\n- Trembling, fidgety and restless\n- Fatigue and trouble sleeping\n- Nausea, diarrhea or digestive issues\nIt’s important to note that some of these symptoms might also be due to the side-effects of medication, or drug and alcohol use.\nWhy do people get anxious?\nAnxiety appears to have a biological basis that evolved with us to help maintain our survival. Back when we existed in tribal communities for hundreds of thousands of years, it made sense to remain vigilant about our own and our tribe’s wellbeing. After all, if we were attacked by bears or plagued by starvation, it would likely be game-over.\nNow, we exist in a world which is a great deal safer, however, our brain is still wired to pick up on things around us that might be interpreted as potential threats. When we find a threat, our nervous system switches into ‘Fight or Flight’ mode, revving up our heart rate, speeding up our breathing, making it hard to relax or focus. When this mode becomes our default, it can wreak havoc on our physical and mental wellbeing.\nHow to deal with anxiety\nAnxiety is exhausting.

Sadly, though, it’s not always attainable for those who need it: Therapy can be expensive and difficult to access, especially if you live in a rural area. Online therapy, also known as e-therapy, can make mental healthcare a little more accessible for those who need it. If you struggle to find transportation to a therapist, or if you can’t find a local therapist you like, online therapy could be the answer. Jana Scrivani, PsyD, a licensed psychologist and online therapy expert, says that flexibility is a huge appeal of online therapy. “Online therapy sessions can be held wherever you have an internet connection! Additionally, online therapy makes it possible for people who are unable to get childcare or those with mobility limitations to have more choice and better access to care,” she says. “We live in a fast-paced society, and for some people, making an appointment and sticking to it is difficult,” says Sal Raichbach, PsyD, LCSW of Ambrosia Treatment Center. Ambrosia’s Family Wellness program offers free therapy sessions via webcam for addicts and alcoholics as well as their loved ones. “Additionally, mental health issues can pop up anytime, and the option of having a licensed therapist to talk to anytime is a tremendous asset to the mental health community,” Raichbach adds. “Those who are handicapped, live in remote areas, or are immobile can also enjoy the accessibility of e-therapy from the comfort of their home.” If you’re considering online therapy, here’s what you need to know.\nWhat is online therapy?\n“Online therapy” is a broad term. It could refer to occasionally using video chat to talk to your therapist if you’re traveling or moving to a new city, or it could refer to using portals like BetterHelp or Talkspace to find and talk to a therapist. There are dozens of online therapy portals, each with their own guidelines, drawbacks, and advantages. Online therapy could also refer to using artificial intelligence and chatbots for therapeutic purposes. For example, Woebot is a free-to-use automated conversational agent, or chatbot, designed by scientists at Stanford University. Woebot tracks the user’s mood, helps the user to find potentially harmful patterns in their behavior, and offers tools and strategies to help the user improve their mood and work through their struggles. In a trial, it was found that Woebot reduced depression and anxiety in users. Another example of a therapy chatbot is Wysa, which is also free. Most online therapy—whether it involves talking to a real therapist or a chatbot—relies on talk therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques. This involves discussing your thoughts, feelings, and actions, and processing them. It also involves noticing and breaking potentially harmful patterns of thought and behavior. It aims to make you more aware of your moods, and it’s one of the most widely-used and studied forms of therapy for mood disorders.\nDoes online therapy actually work?\nOnline therapy might sound good, but is it an effective alternative to in-person therapy? Both Scrivani and Raichbach note that online therapy can be just as beneficial as face-to-face therapy. Studies have suggested that online therapy is an effective form of treatment for depression and anxiety as well as post-traumatic stress disorder. One 2013 study suggested that online therapy was just as good as face-to-face therapy. Of course, there are some limitations to online therapy, Raichbach says. Communication is an essential element of therapy, and if that communication is compromised, it will influence the effectiveness of your treatment. “When it comes to chat therapy, where a therapist and client are joined by text or instant-message chat, there can be some things that get lost in translation,” he explains. “If you think about how often context is misunderstood when you are texting a friend or family member, you can understand why this isn’t ideal for a long-term therapeutic relationship.” Additionally, online therapy can be difficult if the client doesn’t have regular access to a stable internet connection. However, Raichbach adds, online therapy can still be a more accessible alternative to face-to-face therapy—and some therapy is better than no therapy. “For someone who is nervous about therapy or doesn’t have a lot of time on their hands, it can be a great way to get their feet wet,” he adds. Some clients may be more comfortable seeking in-person therapy after they’ve experienced online therapy, so it can be a useful first step.\nWill my privacy be protected in online therapy?\nHow do I choose an online therapist?\nThere are many ways to start online therapy. You might see a therapist in person, and they might suggest you use an online platform to continue therapy if you’re traveling or if you move away. You might also start looking for an online therapist through different platforms—but what exactly should you look for? If you’re deciding between different therapy platforms, make sure they comply with HIPAA or whatever privacy laws are relevant in the country where they’re based. It is also important to make sure therapists have been adequately screened. “Potential clients should look for an online therapy platform that diligently screens their therapists. This is not only a safety concern, but will ensure that the therapist is qualified and capable of doing their job,” Raichbach says. It could also be beneficial to seek a specialized therapist. “When choosing an online therapist, it’s important to make sure that individual is qualified to give the type of treatment you require,” Raichbach says. “For instance, if you are having relationship issues, it would be wise to find a marriage or family counselor or someone who has experience in that subfield, rather than one that has a generalized psychology degree.” Some online therapy platforms will give you a quick questionnaire and match you to a therapist who’s best suited to your needs. Remember that once you find a therapist, it’s not set in stone; you can always look for a different one later if you decide they’re not a good fit. Many online therapy platforms allow you to look for another therapist quickly and easily if you don’t like the one originally assigned to you. Before you pursue therapy of any kind, Raichbach suggests thinking about your goals and reasons for pursuing professional help. Ask yourself, What do I need help with? Which issues do I want to discuss? What do I want to get out of seeing a therapist? To see the benefits of therapy, online or off, both sides must put in some work. It’s very effective in improving mental health, Raichbach says, “but the person seeking help must be willing to work towards those goals with the help of their therapist.”\nDigital Tools for Mental Health Beyond E-Therapy\nIn addition to e-therapy and CBT chatbots, technological improvements mean there are a number of other apps that can be used to support our mental health. Examples include:\n- Meditation apps like Headspace, which is available for both iOS and Android\n- Apps that help you make or break habits, like The Fabulous, also available for iOS and Android\n- Apps like Happify, available on iOS and Android, which help you break negative patterns with exercises that improve your mental wellness\n- Productivity apps that can help people who struggle with executive dysfunction and concentration; try Tide for iOS and Android, or Todoist for iOS and Android\nThese aren’t alternatives to therapy, and they won’t fulfill the role of a licensed mental healthcare provider, but they can support your mental health. Online therapy is revolutionizing mental healthcare, making therapy more accessible to those who need it. Despite its limitations, many people are benefiting from having mental health support at their fingertips. In what ways do you embrace modern technology to support your own mental wellness?

13	light wave photon theory experimental evidence hertz einstein compare	Hertz's experiments supported both wave and particle theories of light - his radio wave experiments showed wave-like behaviors (refraction, diffraction), while his photoelectric effect observations led to Einstein's photon theory. This duality is reflected in modern lab experiments that show some results matching classical wave theory (charge time increasing with decreased transmission) while others support photon theory (stopping potential increasing with frequency).	"['Balmer Series Lab Summary\nHere is the lab manual page.\nHere are my lab notes.\nPartner: Justin Muehlmeyer\nMost people will immediately invoke ""E = mc2"" when asked for what Einstein received his Nobel Prize. As scientists in training, we know that the Prize was instead for his work on the Photoelectric Effect, and this famous relation:\nE = hν + ω0\n...which describes the energy of an electron ejected from a material due to an atom\'s interaction with a photon of energy hν.\nh is Planck\'s constant, and ν is the frequency of the photon. omega0 is the work function, which is a material-dependant value of energy the energized electron has to overcome in order to eject. This experiment is designed to ascertain h.\nA detailed, illustrated discussion of the experimental setup can be found in Dr. Gold\'s manual.\nExperiment 1 - PreliminariesThis experiment is used to show the physical realities of Planck\'s constant and the photoelectric effect qualitatively. We take data on the stopping potential for a frequency, then see how much time the capacitor in the apparatus takes to charge to the stopping potential. Rinse and repeat for another frequency.SJK 18:31, 18 December 2008 (EST)\n|Vstop vs. Transmission||Charge Time vs. Transmission|\nAs one can see, the charge time increases with decreased transmission. This doesn\'t make sense at all using the photon theory of light. If this experiment strictly obeyed the theory of photons, the stopping potential of the apparatus would be the same regardless of how intense the incident light was. Hence, the charge time would be the same for any transmission rate. If the experiment obeyed the classical theory, charge time should increase with decreased transmission - the supposed amplitude of the waves should have decreased, so the ""charged"" photoelectrons ejected should have been less energetic. The observed trend correlates with the classical theory of light. SJK 18:33, 18 December 2008 (EST)\nError bars represent 68% confidence intervals.\nThe voltage reading trend to drop with decreased transmission is at odds with the photon theory as well, via the above argument. The most plausible explanation for the drop I can think of involves the current leak from the capacitor in the apparatus. The manual creates the analogy of the capacitor being a bathtub being filled with ""different flow rates while the drain is partly open."" If the classical waves can\'t charge enough electrons quickly enough, the current leak could overcome the charging under low transmission filters.\nThe next preliminary experiment compares stopping potentials for differing frequencies.\nClearly, the frequency axis increases to the right, as does the stopping potential. This supports the photon theory of light, since the intensity should be fairly constant over the spectra, indicating that intensity doesn\'t alter the energy of excited photoelectrons.\nExperiment 2: Planck\'s Constant\nHere we measure the stopping potential for all spectra in both the first order and second order series.\nVia this illustration of measured spectra from the lab manual:\nFrom Einstein\'s famous relation:\nI can find h via linear regression.\n|accepted h = 4.14e-15 [eV s]|\n|accepted ω0 = 1.36 ± 0.08 [eV]|\nThe accepted values of ω0 and h do not coincide with my 68% confidence interval, but qualitatively are not far off. If one looks at my lab notes, there seems to be significant systematic error in ascertaining the correct stopping potential for either experiment. The most obvious anomaly is the ever-rising trend of voltage measurements in the 2nd-order part of experiment 2. This could result from an electronics design flaw, or perhaps have something to do with the steady rise in temperature of the Hg lamp. By the end of the experiment, the lamp was too hot to touch. It is not obvious how that would change the stopping potential reading, however. The diffraction grating would still separate the component frequencies of light into individual spectra, but the intensity of light would probably increase. An increase in stopping potential as a result of higher intensity would correspond to a classical wave theory of light, which is troubling.', 'German physicist Heinrich Hertz discovered radio waves, a milestone widely seen as confirmation of James Clerk Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory and which paved the way for numerous advances in communication technology. Born in Hamburg on February 22, 1857, Hertz was the eldest of five children. His mother was Elizabeth Pfefferkorn Hertz and his father was Gustav Hertz, a respected lawyer who would later become a legislator. In his youth Heinrich displayed an interest in building things, and as a teenager he constructed a spectroscope and a galvanometer that were so well designed that Hertz used them throughout his college years. Initially Hertz planned a career in engineering, but after a year of employment at the public works office in Frankfurt, a summer of classes at the Polytechnic in Dresden, a year of military service in Berlin, and a brief stint in the engineering department at the University of Munich, he finally decided to pursue the subject that most deeply interested him: science.\nThroughout his life Hertz read works on science and carried out experiments as a hobby. But once he decided that science was to be his career, he applied himself to these tasks with even greater enthusiasm. In the winter of 1877, he studied various scientific treatises, and the following spring, he gained some laboratory experience by working with Gustav von Jolly. Subsequently he enrolled at the University of Berlin, where he was privileged to study under the great German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz. With Helmholtz’s encouragement, Hertz resolved to compete for a research prize to be awarded to the student best able to determine whether or not electricity moved with inertia. Hertz began a series of experiments into the matter, and this mode of learning seemed to suit him. He confided in a letter sent to his family during that time, ""I cannot tell you how much more satisfaction it gives me to gain knowledge for myself and for others directly from nature, rather than merely learning from others and for myself alone.""\nIn August of 1879, Hertz won the prize for his evidence demonstrating that electricity had no inertia. Another prize problem was soon proposed by Helmholtz, who wanted students to attempt to prove which of the theories of electromagnetic phenomena then circulating was correct. Interestingly, Hertz did not choose to compete for this prize, but years later would be the first person to successfully provide the kind of definitive evidence that Helmholtz sought. At the time, Hertz instead embarked on a study of induction produced by rotating spheres. His work in this area helped him earn his doctorate degree ahead of schedule, in 1880, magna cum laude.\nHertz’s first academic post was as lecturer of theoretical physics at the University of Kiel, but due to his dissatisfaction there he accepted a position at the Karlsruhe Polytechnic in 1885. It was at Karlsruhe, where he remained until he received an appointment as physics professor at the University of Bonn in 1889, that Hertz carried out his most important work. In 1886, Hertz began experimenting with sparks emitted across a gap in a short metal loop attached to an induction coil. He soon built a similar apparatus, but without the induction coil, to act as a detector. When the induction coil connected to the first loop (the transmitter) produced a high voltage discharge, a spark jumped across the gap, sending out a signal that Hertz detected as a weaker spark across the gap in the receiving apparatus, which he placed nearby. To determine the nature of the signals that he was able to transmit and receive, Hertz developed a number of innovative experiments.\nBy measuring side sparks that formed around the primary spark and varying the position of the detector, Hertz was able to determine that the signal exhibited a wave pattern, and to ascertain its wavelength. Then, by using a rotating mirror, he found the frequency of the invisible waves, which enabled him to calculate their velocity. Amazingly, the waves were moving at the speed of light. Thus, it appeared to Hertz that he had discovered a previously unknown form of electromagnetic radiation, and in the process confirmed James Clerk Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism. To further prove that this was indeed the case, Hertz continued his experiments exploring the behavior of the invisible waves. He discovered that they traveled in straight lines and could be focused, diffracted, refracted and polarized. Hertz announced his initial discovery in late 1887 in his treatise ""On Electromagnetic Effects Produced by Electrical Disturbances in Insulators”, which he sent to the Berlin Academy. He later published additional details following the series of experiments he carried out in 1888. For a time the waves he discovered were commonly referred to as Hertzian waves, but today they are known as radio waves.\nIn addition to his radio wave breakthrough, Hertz is notable for the discovery of the photoelectric effect, which occurred while he was investigating electromagnetic waves. Because of some difficulty in detecting the small spark produced in his receiving apparatus, Hertz sometimes placed the receiver in a dark case. This, he found, affected the maximum length of the spark, which was smaller than when he did not use the case. With further research into the phenomenon, Hertz discovered that the spark produced was stronger if it was exposed to ultraviolet light. Though he did not attempt to explain this fact, others, including J.J. Thomson and Albert Einstein, would soon realize its importance. The phenomenon of electrons being released from a material when it absorbs radiant energy, which was the cause of the stronger sparks observed by Hertz when ultraviolet radiation was used, would come to be known as the photoelectric effect.\nAfter 1889, when Hertz was teaching at the University of Bonn, he studied electrical discharges in rarefied gases and spent a significant amount of time composing his Principles of Mechanics. Unfortunately, he never saw the work published due to his premature death associated with blood poisoning on New Year’s Day 1894. Only 37 years old at the time, Hertz also never lived to see the tremendous impact the discovery of radio waves would have on the world in the 20th century.']"	['<urn:uuid:48868060-02d2-4840-95f4-4d6c0b32fcd8>', '<urn:uuid:9a7cc391-5e00-478b-bd29-65c9f202db33>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	9	62	1699
14	how sediment traps measure coral reef sedimentation patterns rainfall waves development	Sediment traps are tools used to monitor sedimentation in coral reef environments that collect sediments over sampling periods. They show that sedimentation varies with rainfall intensity, wave activity, and watershed development. The traps reveal that terrigenous (land-based) sedimentation is about four times greater in areas below developed watersheds compared to minimally developed ones. The sediment accumulation rates are highest during major storm events and near stream outflows. However, it's important to note that sediment traps have limitations and don't provide quantitative information about actual sedimentation on coral surfaces, though they can indicate relative magnitudes of sediment dynamics when proper deployment protocols are followed.	"[""The use (and misuse) of sediment traps in coral reef environments : theory, observations, and suggested protocols\nStorlazzi, Curt D.\nField, Michael E.\nBothner, Michael H.\nMetadataShow full item record\nSediment traps are commonly used as standard tools for monitoring “sedimentation” in coral reef environments. In much of the literature where sediment traps were used to measure the effects of “sedimentation” on corals, it is clear from deployment descriptions and interpretations of the resulting data that information derived from sediment traps has frequently been misinterpreted or misapplied. Despite their widespread use in this setting, sediment traps do not provide quantitative information about “sedimentation” on coral surfaces. Traps can provide useful information about the relative magnitude of sediment dynamics if trap deployment standards are used. This conclusion is based first on a brief review of the state of knowledge of sediment trap dynamics, which has primarily focused on traps deployed high above the seabed in relatively deep water, followed by our understanding of near-bed sediment dynamics in shallow-water environments that characterize coral reefs. This overview is followed by the first synthesis of near-bed sediment trap data collected with concurrent hydrodynamic information in coral reef environments. This collective information is utilized to develop nine protocols for using sediment traps in coral reef environments, which focus on trap parameters that researchers can control such as trap height (H), trap mouth diameter (D), the height of the trap mouth above the substrate (z o ), and the spacing between traps. The hydrodynamic behavior of sediment traps and the limitations of data derived from these traps should be forefront when interpreting sediment trap data to infer sediment transport processes in coral reef environments.\n© The Authors, 2010.

The ..."", 'Date of Award\nThesis: Open Access\nMS Marine Science\nEnvironmental and Ocean Sciences\nIn the Caribbean, sedimentation has been identified as a serious threat to coral reef communities. Although land-based sediment delivery to coastal waters harboring coral reefs occurs under natural conditions, human activities in the watersheds above reefs increases the erosion and delivery of terrigenous sediment to the reefs. Delivery of terrigenous sediment into marine areas below developed watersheds affects sedimentation rates, alters the composition and texture of sediments that are suspended in the water column, and/or sediments that are deposited on the sea floor and on corals.\nSt. John, U.S. Virgin Islands is an ideal location to study the effects of rainfall and human development on sedimentation on coral reefs. From a management perspective, there is a need on St. John for studies that examine how watershed development and watershed restoration activities affect marine sedimentation. The island is surrounded by fringing coral reefs and over half the area (56%) of the island’s landmass is largely protected from development by the Virgin Islands National Park (VINP) or the Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument (CRNM). The presence of minimally developed watersheds within the VINP or the CRNM makes it possible to compare sedimentation in bays below adjacent developed and minimally developed watersheds simultaneously.\nBuilding on previous sedimentation studies by our research group, the objectives of this project were to examine how marine sedimentation varied in eastern St. John as a function of: (a) different rainfall parameters and wave activity over several seasons (4-5), (b) location with respect to shoreline runoff inputs and coral reefs, and (c) degree of watershed development.\nSediment traps (13) were deployed over ~26-day sampling periods in shore and offshore reef sites below developed and minimally developed watersheds over five rainy seasons between 2007-2012. Sediments collected in traps were analyzed to determine: (a) the proportion of terrigenous sediment (%T); (b) total sediment accumulation rate (ΣAR), terrigenous sediment accumulation rate (TAR), and silt accumulation rate (SAR) in mg/cm2/d; and (c) sediment grain size. Rainfall data collected from recording rain gauges in Coral Bay were used to determine mean daily rainfall, mean rainfall intensity, maximum daily rainfall, and an antecedent precipitation index (API) for each ~26-day sampling period. Wave height data were collected from NOAA buoys near St. John or St. Croix (USVI). The relationships between TARs and parameters of rainfall (mean daily rainfall, mean rainfall intensity, and maximum daily rainfall) and wave height (mean, median and maximum) were tested using regression analyses.\nThe 2007 to 2012 study period included storm events characterized by a wide variety of total rainfall amounts and swell. Tropical Storm Otto during October of 2010 was the greatest rain-producing storm historically. One to two major storms (storms characterized by 100 mm or more of rainfall) occurred each year from 2007 – 2012, all of which occurred between May and December. Based on the cumulative rainfall per storm, Hurricane Earl (9/2010) only ranked 18th but was notable due to the high wind and ocean swells produced.\nTAR and %T were normally greater during periods of greater rainfall and varied more with rainfall intensity and maximum daily rainfall than with mean rainfall intensity. At most sites, the greatest TARs were recorded during the sampling period when Tropical Storm Otto occurred. Because of the ephemeral nature of runoff on St. John, terrigenous sediment delivery only occurred during periods when there was enough rainfall to saturate the soil and produce saturation overland flow. Increased wave activity was sometimes associated with high rainfall, thus, sediment resuspension from the seafloor in addition to runoff from rainfall contributed to TAR during some rainfall/storm events. Resuspension caused by waves can lead to the entrapment of both terrigenous and carbonate grains, explaining why wave activity simultaneously increased TAR and lowered %T, even during periods during both runoff and non runoff sampling periods. For example, resuspension during both Tropical Storm Otto (characterized by high runoff) and T.S. Earl (characterized by little to no runoff) produced %Ts lower than the study period means. Some resuspension contributed to sediment accumulated in most traps during periods with moderate to low rainfall and wave activity.\n%T and TAR were greatest nearest to the ephemeral stream outfalls, where most terrigenous sediments are presumed to be deposited following delivery to the bay. Because there is greater terrigenous sedimentation near shore and greater carbonate production offshore, mean grain sizes were normally finer near shore compared to at the offshore reef locations, as terrigenous grains are in general finer than carbonate grains.\nConsistent with (a) GIS-based modeling and watershed erosion studies at our study sites that predicted 3 to 10 times greater sediment delivery below developed compared with minimally developed watersheds, and (b) previous sediment trap studies, terrigenous sedimentation was on average approximately four times greater below developed compared with minimally developed watersheds. When API (a proxy for soil moisture) was considered in the regression model, rainfall better predicted TAR below the minimally developed but not the developed watershed. High density of exposed and compacted surfaces such as unpaved roads, where sediments are more easily eroded and where compaction of soil favors runoff over infiltration, may have contributed to greater terrigenous sedimentation overall below developed watersheds. Because there is greater terrigenous sediment below developed watersheds, mean grain size was normally (but not always) finer for sediment collected below developed compared with minimally developed watersheds.\nBased on the comparisons between our total (ΣAR) and silt accumulation rates (SARs) with published levels related to coral stress, corals near our study locations were most likely subjected to greater stress during (and immediately following) study periods of high rainfall, near shore, and below developed watersheds. SARs exceeding 4 mg/cm2/d were measured approximately twice as frequently (86% of sampling periods) at the shore sites with patch reefs below developed compared to the minimally developed watersheds (42% and 32% of sampling periods). Similarly, SARs exceeding 4 mg/cm2/d more commonly occurred at the offshore reef below the developed watershed (40% of sampling periods) than below the minimally developed watershed (11% of sampling periods).\nAs building and human development continues along tropical and subtropical coastlines, the input of terrigenous sediment is likely to increase on coral reefs. The outcomes of this study have shown that sediment traps are an effective way to monitor general temporal and spatial patterns in terrigenous sedimentation. This study is the first marine sediment trap study to capture the natural variability in storms, rainfall, and wave activity over a study period longer than two years that also monitored distinct near shore and offshore areas below both developed and minimally developed watersheds simultaneously. Monitoring simultaneously across distinct areas over a long, 5-year study period made it possible to examine the relationship between terrigenous sedimentation, rainfall and wave activity statistically, and identify areas most likely to be subjected to the greatest sediment-related coral stress. The results of this study have generated potentially useful data related to watershed land management in tropical, coastal areas and will help inform future studies that will assess the effect of watershed restoration efforts on terrigenous sediment delivery to marine areas harboring coral reefs.\nDigital USD Citation\nSears, Whitney, ""Factors Affecting Terrigenous Sedimentation in Coastal Bays with Coral Reefs: Implications for Monitoring the Effectiveness of Watershed Restoration"" (2015).

['Sheikh Thambi Pavalar(Tamil: செய்கு தம்பி பாவலர்)(1874 - 1950) was an Tamil poet, scholar and an Indian independence activist. He was born on 31-July-1874 as the third son of Pakeer Meeran sahib and Ameena. He had his earlier education at Edalakudy. He was also a good orator. He learned Arabic language in his early age and was a disciple of Sankaranarayana Pattariar, a Tamil scholar lived in Kottar. He was well versed in ‘Kamba Ramayana’. In the year 1859, he worked as the editor of two Tamil magazines namely ‘Yatharthavadhi’ and ‘Islamic Mithran’ in Chennai.

16	soft law international migration agreements practical impact enforcement	The impact of soft law instruments in international migration varies. The Global Compact for Migration (GCM), while only politically binding, can have concrete legal effects through harmonization of national laws and bilateral agreements. The advantage of such soft law instruments is that they allow states to quickly clarify positions on controversial topics while avoiding lengthy treaty ratification processes. However, their effectiveness faces challenges, as seen in cases like Bouyid v Belgium where even established legal principles like human dignity can be difficult to enforce consistently. The implementation and oversight mechanisms also have limitations - unlike the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the GCM lacks specific numerical targets and benchmarks, which can make enforcement and monitoring of commitments more challenging.	['It is my pleasure to introduce a guest commentary on the Grand Chamber judgment of Bouyid v Belgium (Appl.no. 23380/09 ) of last September. The commentary was written by a colleague here at Utrecht University, dr Stephen Riley, who is a postdoctoral researcher at the Ethics Institute in a project on human dignity and human rights. Here is his commentary:\nCase of Bouyid v Belgium (GC, 28 September 2015)\nBy a majority, the Grand Chamber found a violation of Article 3 following the slapping of two brothers held in police custody. The interest of the case lies in its extending the scope of ‘degradation’ but also in the problematic use of human dignity in the decision.\nThere was a five-year history of conflict between members of the Bouyid family and the staff of a local police station. The applicants, brothers, had at separate times had altercations with police officers, been taken into custody, and been slapped by an officer after provocative or uncooperative behaviour. That the brothers had been slapped was corroborated by medical evidence. Given the special burden of proof applicable in detention cases (it is for the State authorities to cast doubt on the applicants’ account) the Grand Chamber accepted that a claim of mistreatment was justified and that the question of a Convention violation could be addressed.\nThe question for the Court was evidence of ‘degradation’. This requires injury or suffering of a minimum severity (para. 86). Analysis offered by a third-party argued that ‘severity’ is partially relative to circumstances, and situations of detention and vulnerability mean that acts like a slap to the face, which in other circumstances might be at the lower level of criminality, take on greater significance and gain sufficient ‘severity’ (para. 73). The Court itself asserted that circumstances can be such that an otherwise minor form of mistreatment becomes a violation of human dignity and can thereby be considered degrading (para. 87). In conjunction with the remaining evidence, the Court found “that the applicants’ dignity was undermined and that there has therefore been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention” (para. 102).\nIn order to understand how human dignity was at issue, I will briefly reconstruct the judgment and dissent. The majority in the judgment held that, given certain background conditions (detention and vulnerability), what would otherwise only be a criminal act becomes harm to human dignity; that kind of harm, inflicted by an agent of the State, is necessarily a violation of Article 3 unless it is proven that the victim’s own actions justified the harm. The dissenting opinion, denying an Article 3 violation, asserted that given certain background conditions (detention and vulnerability) and a certain level of severity to the act itself what would otherwise only be a criminal act becomes harm to human dignity; that kind of harm, inflicted by an agent of the State, is necessarily a violation of Article 3 unless it is proven that the victim’s own actions justified the harm. That is, while the majority lists certain kinds of physical or mental ill-treatment that would be considered severe, they also include the bare idea of “showing a lack of respect for or diminishing [a detainee’s] human dignity” (para. 87) as a distinctive and supplemental instance of ‘severity ‘. In contrast, the dissenters claim that “there are forms of treatment which, while interfering with human dignity, do not attain the minimum level of severity required to fall within the scope of Article 3” (dissent para 5).\nWith respect to case as a contribution to Article 3 jurisprudence, the dissent raises important concerns. While not condoning mistreatment by State officials it asserts that it “is not for the Court to impose general rules of conduct on law-enforcement officers […]” (dissent para. 6) and it pointedly questions whether the threat of a single slap by a police officer would be enough to justify a non-refoulement decision (footnote 2). The thrust of the dissent however hinges on the significance and function of human dignity and the redundancy of the majority judgment’s uses of human dignity (dissent para. 4). Why should human dignity be considered redundant?\nWhat engaged Article 3 was ‘harm to human dignity’ understood as unjustified harm, in a situation of detention, amounting to degradation. What, then, justifies the application of this standard? The majority judgment provides a catalogue of human dignity uses in international law (para. 45f). However, their function is not entirely clear. They act partly as prelude to discussion of more directly applicable instruments on torture and police procedure. They also help to justify more dramatic claims about the link between Article 3, human dignity, and the foundations of ‘civilisation’ (para. 81). Crucially, the Court implies that there is a special class of harm, or a special conception of wrong, implied by human dignity which is engaged whenever an individual is vulnerable (relative to the State) and harmed (para. 90). This is problematic and the basis of the charge of redundancy. How would such a class of harm be determined separately from our normal understanding of Article 3? After all, there may be human dignity harms that are not Article 3 violations but they would not be the concern of the Court unless they were violations of other Convention rights (in which case the relevance of ‘vulnerability’ and ‘harm’ would presumably be very different). Conversely, if harm to human dignity arises whenever there is detention and harm, then the scope of Article 3 protections seems to become unworkably wide.\nFrom this we can see in outline the problematic status of human dignity within the Court’s jurisprudence as a whole. Human dignity is often invoked as a foundational principle for human rights law, but denoting a special class of harm does not obviously fulfil this kind of foundational role. Put the other way around, cataloguing ways in which human dignity is foundational fails to justify a special link with Article 3 or a special class of harms; the link between human dignity and a special kind of degradation cannot be made from the preambular remarks of international human rights instruments alone. The growing body of Article 3 jurisprudence that does treat it as a special kind of prohibitive principle is increasingly problematic if it entails that any kind of mistreatment in detention is an Article 3 violation. There is, in essence, a disconnection between the foundational uses of human dignity in international law and the harm-centred jurisprudence of Article 3, a disconnection that only gets wider after a decision like Bouyid.\nIn sum, this judgment hinges upon a set of related claims that continue to inform and distort Article 3 jurisprudence. First, general international and regional materials on human dignity are broadly relevant to Article 3 cases, but they seem far less relevant than specific instruments on detention and mistreatment. Second, human dignity might be seen as a general principle counselling particular care with regards to those in custody, but it is not clear that human dignity provides for a specific kind of injury. Finally, Article 3 and human dignity together are treated cornerstones of ‘civilisation’ but such grand claims seem incongruous with the severity of the mistreatment found in a case like this.', 'A New Special Issue on the Rule of Law and Human Mobility in the Age of the Global Compacts – Classics in New Refractions\nContribution by Dr Tamas Molnar (legal research officer, EU Agency for Fundamental Rights; visiting lecturer, Corvinus University of Budapest, Hungary)*, Dr Marion Panizzon (senior research fellow, World Trade Institute, University of Bern, Switzerland) and Dr Daniela Vitiello (researcher in EU law, University of Tuscia, Italy)\n* The views expressed in this blogpost are solely those of the author and its content does not necessarily represent the views or position of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights.\n7 June 2022\nSetting the Scene: “It Is a Bird, It Is a Plane, It Is a Global Compact!”\nCross-border human mobility remains a “vision” for many and becomes a reality for others. The United Nations (UN) Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM) assists in the legal aspiration to turn dangerous routes and unsafe journeys into legal pathways by “strengthening international cooperation” for effective migration management (Objective 23). Still, the sovereign right of States to decide whom to admit limits migration trajectories, while a diversified toolbox of multilateral treaties, bilateral agreements and a plethora of soft law instruments govern other phases of the trajectory. Within this spectrum, the GCM takes a central place as the “first intergovernmental agreement prepared under the auspices of the [UN], to cover all dimensions of international migration in a holistic and comprehensive manner” – borrowing the words of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nAlthough the guiding principles, objectives and planned actions set out in the GCM are only “politically binding”, this does not mean that they are devoid of legal effects. Such legal effects include prompting harmonization of national legislations, initiating bilateral agreements and partnerships, or fine-tuning a legal concept. Although there are tenable arguments suggesting that the soft legal nature of the GCM risks to weaken the normative edifice built by the UN human rights framework, it remains to be seen how the advantages of informal international law-making in the field of migration outweigh its perceived risks. Bufalini, among others, highlights two advantages of the GCM as soft law: non-legally binding instruments enable States to rapidly clarify their positions and expectations on heated topics, while avoiding the time-consuming process of both the conclusion of a treaty and its domestic ratification.\nNext to unveiling its legal nature and (non-)binding character (see e.g. Gammeltoft-Hansen et al., Gavouneli, and Chetail), the human rights anchorage of the GCM and the GCR has equally sparked the interests of both scholars and practitioners (see e.g. Guild). Respect for human rights figures as one of the guiding principles and the GCM self-proclaims being grounded in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the nine core UN Human Rights Conventions. However, human rights are only one of the tenants of the new cooperative framework under the GCM; a framework within which the principle of good global governance – forming a stronghold of the Global Compact for Refugees (GCR) – fails to be fully acknowledged as a “guiding principle”. Likewise, the primacy of human rights, with a view to superseding State sovereignty, is neither proposed nor implied in the GCM.\nA Special Issue of MDPI ‘Laws’ Offering Fresh Insights into the Classics with New Dynamics\nAgainst this backdrop, a number of intriguing scholarly questions arise, inter alia, in the forcefield of the two Global Compacts:\n- Which relations exist between the rule of law and the governance of human mobility within the Global Compacts?\n- What kind of legal effects can these soft law instruments produce; and are these legal effects – under certain conditions – more effective than the implementation of hard law?\n- Does the dominantly political nature of the commitments in the GCM exclude or include that some standards might produce legally binding effects?\nIn a collection of seven articles, a new Special Issue for MDPI ‘Laws’ entitled “The Rule of Law and Human Mobility in the Age of the Global Compacts” discusses, among others, how (national and regional) legal systems might “embed” the global soft law setting out the cooperation frameworks on international migration governance. Also, this Special Issue looks at possible legal bases for formally incorporating the two Global Compacts’ commitments; and whether establishing congruence and a subsequent duty of implementation is rather one of systemic interpretation resembling to Article 31(1) of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties read in conjunction with the objective of progressively developing international law (see also Ammann). Similarly, the role played by the GCM guiding principles – which might exist as general principles of law (rule of law, non-discrimination, non-regression) – in interconnecting soft law to hard legal obligations are put under scrutiny. Special attention is devoted to regional practices, especially at the European Union (EU) level, taking into account the prominent role played by EU cooperative models in shaping concepts and governance mechanisms envisaged by the Global Compacts. These and other questions have guided the authors of the pieces making up this Special Issue which are summarized hereunder.\nGuiding Principles of the Global Compacts\nGuiding principles serve to create a common narrative – the same holds true for those of the GCM. Allinson, Guild and Busuttil posit that the Global Compacts incorporate guiding principles (GCR) and crosscutting and interdependent legally binding obligations (GCM), at the forefront of the duty to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights. This article discusses how the GCM and GCR, despite being non-legally binding, can constitute an interpretative tool prompting adherence to three legal principles: the rule of law, the non-retrogression of human rights and the principle of non-discrimination. The authors argue that the EU asylum acquis – as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) – cannot disregard the principle of non-retrogression as enshrined in the Global Compacts, when interpreting the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.\nThe Global Compacts’ Impact at the EU Level: Puzzling Realties\nCornelisse and Reneman analyse the (potential) role of the Global Compacts in the development of EU law concerning asylum seekers who arrive at the EU external borders. Despite widespread violations of their fundamental rights at the EU external borders, the New EU Pact on Migration and Asylum presents integrated border procedures as important instruments to “deal with mixed flows” and make the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) work. The authors underscore that the EU legislator has not substantiated the claim that border procedures will contribute to achieving the aims of the CEAS, such as the creation of a uniform, fair and efficient asylum procedure, preventing abuses. Neither does the Pact provide a solution for pushbacks and systematic use of immigration detention, nor does it guarantee the quality of the asylum procedure. The article thus concludes that these new legislative proposals ignore the standards of the Global Compacts, and ask the question: What role can the Global Compacts still play in the ongoing negotiations over the legislative proposals present under the EU Pact?\nStill remaining in the EU context and set against the background of emerging CJEU jurisprudence as a response to the “rule of law crisis” in some EU Member States, the contribution by Favi aims at investigating this CJEU’s jurisprudence through the lens of the Global Compacts. This leads to reflect on how the CJEU’s caselaw could be seen as an effective tool to enhance the rule of law and protect third-country nationals, at least within the EU, and to what extent it can indirectly contribute to increasing compliance with some of the commitments laid down in the Global Compacts, regardless of the position taken by some recalcitrant EU Member States with respect to these universal instruments.\nA third article in this strand by Vitiello (forthcoming) takes the regional (European) practice of border ‘securitisation’ and the management of large flows of refugees and migrants at the EU level as a case study to investigate the interplay between the quest for safe, orderly and regular migration via global partnerships (Objective 23 of the GCM) and States’ commitment to manage borders in an integrated and coordinated manner (Objective 11 of the GCM). With a view to contributing to the debate stimulated by the forthcoming first International Migration Review Forum (IMRF), the article elucidates the conditions under which the ambivalent interaction between the quest for regular pathways and the cooperation on border management may lead to the enhancement – or (vice versa) to a further dilution – of the legal entitlements of migrants and refugees.\nNational Perspectives on the Global Compacts: The Case of India\nAtul and Singh, in their piece analysing the impact of the GCR on Indian statutory and judicial practice over access to asylum for Afghan refugees, similarly caution against overrating the benefits of the Global Compacts and unquestioningly elevating the virtues of soft law therein. In the case of India, where non-refoulement, access to asylum, to due process and to essential services for migrants and refugees are court-adjudicated, the intake of the GCR by the Indian government has exacerbated an upfront confrontation of what happens when no domestic legislation is in place to absorb the objectives and political commitments assumed at the international level.\nImplementation and Review of the Commitments in the Global Compacts: Selected Issues\nProspectively, in light of the forthcoming first IMRF, a pressing challenge is to ensure the effective implementation and oversight of the undertaken obligations in the Global Compacts. Unlike the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, whose progresses towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals are tracked by numerical indicators and targets, such benchmarks are absent in the GCM. Two forthcoming articles of the Special Issue deal with the issue of monitoring the implementation of the GCM’s objectives, from different perspectives.\nYildiz stresses that, as the international community could not agree on benchmarking, the GCM’s monitoring and review mechanisms fail to build sufficient peer pressure to nudge States towards facilitating human mobility triggered by disasters and climate change. Her article contributes to a better understanding of the limited translation into action of States’ commitments related to disasters and climate change under the Global Compacts.\nAnother illustrative case in point concerns detention-related commitments, representing a highly sensitive topic as well as a controversial – and very intrusive – immigration law enforcement measure. As Majcher argues, States committed to use immigration detention only as a measure of last resort and to work towards alternatives in Objective 13 of the GCM, drawing from eight sets of actions to attain this commitment. She uses immigration detention as a case study to submit that synergies between the GCM’s commitments and existing human rights regimes can boost the mechanisms for monitoring States’ implementation. For instance, given the similarities between the IMRF and the Universal Periodic Review under the auspices of the UN Human Rights Council, the latter could inspire legal and policy innovations for improvement of the GCM review and oversight. The author concludes that there are avenues by which Objective 13 of the GCM could be used to strengthen the rule of law in global migration governance.\nThe Way Ahead\nThe Global Compacts for Migration and for Refugees promise more than a compilation (and, according to Chetail, consolidation) of existing international legal standards governing migration and refugees. Yet, as the latest draft of the IMRF Progress Declaration on the implementation of the GCM shows, many of the underlying challenges, including the under-developed concept of the rule of law and due process remain, even if COVID-19 measures taken by many States during the pandemic have temporarily improved the situation and well-being of migrants, “regardless of their status and the phase during the migration cycle”. Far from being permanently encroached in law, a great deal of these domestic legislations are executive (emergency) orders lacking democratic control and disabling due process or access to justice.\nNotwithstanding these flaws, States have been given credit for “making migration work for all” as per the 2017 report of the UN Secretary General, even if much of their voluntary reporting dwells deliberately on contingent motivations, often to distract from more contentious and highly debatable policies and practices. As Farhat and Bast point out in another recent special issue on the GCM, the voluntary nature of reporting before the GCM review bodies inescapably entails a degree of “cherry-picking” by States over which of the 23 objectives they wish to report and over which ones to abstain. Hence, the upcoming Progress Declaration of the International Migration Review Forum in May 2022 will show if and over which political commitments States are most ready and willing to cooperate. The expected 2022 IMRF Progress Declaration will likely shed more light on where gaps persist and ideally, pinpoint to where States agree on a prioritization, which would instill the GCM with a legal dynamic that would promise to move it beyond its current re-affirmation of best practices and desired actions. If States were to re-arrange certain commitments along a scale of “relative normativity”, including by elevating human rights protection to a status further challenging state sovereignty, such a progress would mark a first step towards a “firming up” of the legal tissue of the Global Compacts.\nIn sum, the Global Compact for Migration has the potential to transform the grip and the profile of international soft law and thereby to re-arrange the cartography of international migration law. Yet, multiplied efforts by legal scholars, practitioners and the civil society are necessary to bring about the kind of meaning-making from the GCM, which might serve to unearth new priorities and a more effective dialogue among the 23 Objectives. In the Guest Editors’ earnest hope, this Special Issue helps generate further discussions around the issues outlined above.

17	essential equipment needed start home photo studio	To start a home photo studio, the essential equipment needed includes: a good camera with a lens suitable for low-light conditions, a tripod, a computer with photo editing software like Photoshop or Lightroom, studio lighting equipment (either a kit or self-built using bulbs and reflectors), and an appropriate space that can accommodate the setup. The space should be large enough for equipment and preferably have windows that can be covered to control natural light.	['Three Things to Know When Buying Your Lighting Essentials\nLighting can affect a shot, too much or less of it is a matter of delivering the perfect shot. Every photographer would stop relying on its camera’s built – in flash and start discovering and exploring more on playing with light. Thus, this article will guide you on the essentials of lighting.\nThere would come a point when enthusiasts are not satisfied with the internal flash of its camera since it can create flat pictures and red eye. Also, it can only bring light to objects that are close enough to the camera. With these problems came the used of flash guns or external flash units as a solution. It is able to give a photographer the control of the light’s direction\nWhen purchasing for a flash gun, look at its Guide Number, showing its power. It’s normally indicated by companies with ISO 100 so it can be easily compared to other models or brands. In addition, the guide number helps in determining what aperture you need to use during a shoot.\nToday, there are entry levels lighting starter kits that are affordable. These starter kits can give a person the chance to improve their skills into a new level by being able to have a professional studio set – up. Depending on what you need, a basic lighting kit can have a number of lights, stands and umbrella which is enough for those who are starting out. For those who are looking for a better set – up, some kits can have filters, diffusers, backgrounds and soft boxes. The kits come with bags or cases for easy transportation, keeping and handling of the equipment.\nWhen choosing for a kit, there are factors to consider like the genre of photography, the space where it will be used, what you really need and the budget. Through this you can list what you need thus, eliminating over spending.\nThe Lighting Know – How\nWhen setting up the lights it is important to know its basic things like the three – point lighting set – up. This set – up is a must to know for every photographer since it brings to life the photos being taken.\nIt is made up of the fill, key and back light. The key light is responsible for lighting the subject and can be placed at different angles to create different looks on the shots. Meanwhile, the fill light is used to equalize the shadows created by the key light. Lastly, the back light is placed behind the subject or model to highlight its contours and lines. This set – up makes the subject stand – out instead of blending in with the background and giving it more life.\nFor those who are building their own studio, it is important to know that there are a variety of lights to use in this set – up, these are the strobe lights (flashlights) and the continuous lights (tungsten and fluorescent). The continuous lights enable photographers have a look of an exposed image, thus he can adjust the color quickly. These lights are also common in the household. Meanwhile, the strobe lights are used to because of its flexibility and are great for shooting things in motion.', 'Setting up a photo studio doesn’t have to be difficult, but there are a few things you need to keep in mind. This article will go over the basics of setting up a photo studio, from choosing the right space to setting up your lighting.\nThe first thing you need to consider when setting up a photo studio is the space you’re working with. The space should be large enough to accommodate the equipment you’ll be using, and it should be relatively quiet and dark. If you’re working with natural light, you’ll also need a space that has windows that can be covered or blocked off.\nOnce you’ve chosen a space, you need to set up your lighting. The most basic lighting setup for a photo studio is a three-point lighting system. This setup involves using three lights: a key light, a fill light, and a back light. The key light is the main light in the scene, and it should be positioned in front of the subject. The fill light is used to fill in the shadows created by the key light, and it should be positioned to the side of the subject. The back light is used to create a sense of depth and to separate the subject from the background. It should be positioned behind the subject.\nIf you’re not using natural light, you’ll need to set up artificial lights. There are a variety of different types of artificial lights that you can use, so you’ll need to choose the ones that best suit your needs. Once you’ve chosen the lights, you’ll need to figure out the best way to position them. You’ll also need to create a light stand or a light box.\nNow that you’ve set up your space and your lighting, you need to decide what you want to photograph. If you’re just starting out, it might be a good idea to start with simple subjects, like flowers or portraits. Once you’ve gotten the hang of things, you can start branching out and trying more complicated subjects.\nThe final step in setting up a photo studio is to adjust the camera settings. You’ll need to decide what aperture and shutter speed you want to use, and you’ll also need to set up the white balance. Once you’ve done that, you’re ready to start shooting.\n- 1 What do I need to start a photo studio?\n- 2 Is a photo studio profitable?\n- 3 How do I turn my room into a photography studio?\n- 4 How do I make a photo studio for professional photography at home?\n- 5 How much does it cost to run a photo studio?\n- 6 How do I start a photography business with no experience?\n- 7 What type of photography is most profitable?\nWhat do I need to start a photo studio?\nIf you’re thinking of starting a photo studio, you’ll need to invest in some essential equipment. This article will walk you through what you need to get started.\nOne of the most important things you’ll need is a good camera. You’ll also need a lens that can shoot in low light conditions, as well as a tripod to keep your camera still while you’re taking photos.\nYou’ll also need a good computer to edit your photos, as well as software such as Photoshop or Lightroom.\nIn addition, you’ll need studio lighting to create the right lighting conditions for your photos. You can either buy a studio lighting kit, or you can build your own using light bulbs and reflectors.\nFinally, you’ll need a space to set up your studio. This can be anything from a spare room in your house to a dedicated studio space.\nIs a photo studio profitable?\nOpening a photo studio can be a great way to make a living as a photographer. However, it is important to understand whether or not a photo studio is profitable.\nThere are a few things to consider when determining if a photo studio is profitable. The first is overhead. Studios require space and equipment, both of which can be expensive. The second consideration is how much money you will need to make to cover your costs.\nAssuming you have the overhead costs covered, you need to think about how much you will charge for your services. Generally, studios charge more than portrait photographers who work out of their homes. However, it is important to make sure you are not pricing yourself out of the market.\nIn order to make a profit, your studio will need to generate more revenue than your costs. This includes the cost of your equipment, the rent for your studio, and your salary.\nIf you are able to cover your costs and generate a profit, a photo studio can be a great way to make a living as a photographer. However, it is important to do your research and make sure it is the right fit for you.\nHow do I turn my room into a photography studio?\nTurning your room into a photography studio is a great way to save money on professional photography fees and to have more creative control over your photos. By following a few simple tips, you can create a space that is perfect for your photography needs.\nThe most important thing to consider when transforming your room into a photography studio is the lighting. Natural light is always best, so try to find a room with a large window or space that can be easily opened to allow in natural light. If natural light is not available, you can also use artificial light sources, such as lamps or studio lighting kits.\nOnce you have determined the lighting situation, you need to think about the other elements that will make up your photography studio. A good studio backdrop is essential, so consider purchasing a background stand and a few different types of backdrops, such as solid colors, textures, or patterns. In addition, you will need a place to store your props and equipment, so consider setting up some shelves or a storage closet.\nFinally, make sure that your photography studio is comfortable and inviting. Add some personal touches, such as a comfortable chair or a few plants, to make you feel at home in your new space.\nHow do I make a photo studio for professional photography at home?\nCreating a photo studio at home is a great way to save money on professional photography and to have more control over the photos you take. By making a few simple modifications to a room in your home, you can create a space that is perfect for professional photography.\nThe first step is to select a room in your home that is large enough to accommodate the photo studio. Once you have selected a room, you will need to make some modifications to the space to create a studio-like environment. One of the most important things to consider is the lighting in the room. You will need to make sure that there is plenty of natural light in the room, as well as artificial light sources to create the right mood and atmosphere for your photos.\nYou will also need to consider the background in the room. If you are taking photos of people, you will need to have a solid background that will not distract from the subject of the photo. If you are taking product photos, you will need to have a background that is easy to change and that will not show any wrinkles or folds.\nFinally, you will need to consider the accessories that you will need to create a professional photo studio at home. Some of the most important accessories include a tripod, a light reflector, and a light diffuser. With these accessories, you will be able to create the perfect environment for taking professional photos at home.\nHow much does it cost to run a photo studio?\nOpening a photo studio is a big investment. There are a lot of costs to consider before you decide to take the plunge. In this article, we’ll take a look at some of the main expenses you’ll incur and what you can do to keep your costs down.\nThe biggest expense you’ll have is likely your photography equipment. Depending on the type of studio you open, you may need a variety of equipment, from digital SLRs and studio lighting to backdrops and props. If you’re starting out, you’ll likely need to invest in some basics, and the cost of this equipment can add up quickly.\nAnother big expense is your studio space. Renting or leasing a studio can be expensive, especially in popular areas. You’ll need to factor in your rent or lease payments, as well as any utilities or other bills you may need to pay.\nOther costs to consider include marketing and advertising, staff salaries, and photography supplies. All of these costs can add up, so it’s important to plan ahead and budget appropriately.\nThere are a few ways you can reduce your photo studio costs. One is to shop around for the best deals on equipment and supplies. You may also be able to save money by choosing a less expensive studio space. And, finally, you can reduce your advertising and marketing expenses by using online tools such as social media and blog sites.\nOverall, opening a photo studio can be a costly endeavor, but with careful planning, you can keep your expenses under control. By understanding the different costs involved, you can make informed decisions about how to start and run your studio.\nHow do I start a photography business with no experience?\nSo you want to start a photography business but don’t have any experience?

19	I have a family member with high blood pressure and another with intracranial hypertension - what are the risk factors for each condition, and how do their treatments differ?	For regular high blood pressure, risk factors include being overweight, excessive salt intake, lack of exercise, excessive alcohol consumption, being over 65, having a family history, and being of black African or Caribbean descent. Treatment involves lifestyle changes and medications like ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. For intracranial hypertension, risk factors include being female of reproductive age, and it can be triggered by certain medications like tetracyclines. Treatment typically involves removing triggering factors and using medications like acetazolamide to reduce cerebrospinal fluid production, or in severe cases, surgical interventions.	"[""Minocycline-associated Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension In A Patient Presenting To The Emergency Department\nP Targonski, N Schiebel, C Lucchinetti\nadverse drug reaction, ards, cardiac, cardio-pulmonary support, critical care, education, emergency medicine, hemodynamics, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, intensive care medicine, intensive care unit, medicine, minocycline, multiorgan failure, neuro, patient care, pediatric, respiratory failure, surgical i, ventilation\nP Targonski, N Schiebel, C Lucchinetti. Minocycline-associated Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension In A Patient Presenting To The Emergency Department. The Internet Journal of Pharmacology. 2001 Volume 1 Number 2.\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition characterized by signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), such as headache, papilledema and increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, in the presence of an otherwise normal neurological examination (1). On assessment, patients will exhibit normal CSF composition, normal neuroradiological imaging studies (in particular, computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), and the absence of specific systemic or structural etiologies to explain the increased ICP (2).\nOriginally described by Quincke as “serous meningitis” (3) and also referred to as pseudotumor cerebri or benign intracranial hypertension, epidemiological studies of IIH suggest a crude annual incidence rate of 0.9-1.7 per 100,000 persons (4,5,6). Several associations have been suggested, including female gender, obesity or recent weight gain, endocrinopathies, and medication use (1,7,8). We report a case of minocycline-associated IIH in a young female presenting to the emergency department for evaluation of headaches with visual changes.\nReport of a Case\nA thin (BMI= 19.5 kg/m2) 17 year old female presented to the emergency department with a bitemporal throbbing headache, intermittently present for 10-14 days. The headache was exacerbated with reading and worsened in severity from morning to evening. The patient experienced nausea without emesis during the most severe exacerbations, and obtained transient pain relief from acetaminophen with codeine.\nWithin 3-5 days prior to presentation, the patient began to observe sporadic episodes of self-limited horizontal diplopia, usually occurring in conjunction with her most severe headaches or in the evening. Like the headaches, these episodes were exacerbated by reading, and were occasionally accompanied by mild visual blurring without a specific field defect. Although she obtained no relief from medications, the diplopia resolved when either eye was closed during an attack. The patient historically used contact lenses without regard for which eye each lens was designated for, but did not feel that switching contact lenses between eyes altered her symptoms. She denied fever, chills, infectious complaints, neck stiffness, weight change or other symptoms.\nHer past medical history was significant for exercise-induces asthma, menstrual irregularities, and acne vulgaris. Other than acetaminophen or acetaminophen with codeine, she had been receiving minocycline for approximately 16 weeks prior to presentation. She stopped the minocycline on the day of presentation and denied any other medication use, including oral contraceptives. Her family history included maternal migraines and Von Willebrand's Disease, as well as an aunt with a pituitary tumor (type unknown) but no other family history of endocrine or other malignancies.\nPhysical examination revealed slightly swollen, mildly hyperemic optic discs with single flame hemorrhages present in each eye and an otherwise normal neurological and general examination. Visual acuity and field were at that time grossly normal and confirmed by an ophthalmologist. Laboratory studies, including CBC, ESR, coagulation studies and urinalysis were normal, and urine HCG was negative. Lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 255 mm H2O with normal cell count, glucose and protein. Head CT (Figure 1) was normal, and head MRI (Figure 2) with MR venous angiography (Figure 3) obtained after referral to a neurologist were normal.\nThe patient's course was complicated by post-lumbar puncture headache that resolved with blood patch. The minocycline was discontinued and she was started on acetazolamide, 250 mg orally twice per day. Her visual complaints resolved within 3-5 days and the intensity and frequency of headaches declined gradually over a period of two weeks.\nThis 17-year old female presented with chief complaints of headache, diplopia and visual obscurations, which are among the more common symptoms reported in IIH. A case-control study by Giuseffi et al. examining symptoms among IIH patients noted headache (94%), transient visual obscurations (68%), and pulsatile intracranial noises (58%) as the three most common presenting complaints (7).\nOther common symptoms observed in IIH included photopsia (54%), diplopia (38%) and visual loss (30%) (7). Our patient's ophthalmic presentation was complicated by her habit of inserting contact lenses without regard to the correct lens for each eye, although it did not alter our evaluation and management. Population-based studies have suggested that 22% of patients with IIH will suffer some form of visual loss during the course of their disease (4), with severe visual deficits in 25-30% of patients with IIH in referral-based studies (7,9). Less frequent symptoms such as neck tenderness (10,11), nausea and vomiting (7,10) have also been reported.\nThe patient in this report also exhibited bilateral papilledema, although unilateral and asymmetric papilledema may also be found among patients with IIH (1). Optic nerve atrophy may result from protracted periods of papilledema, leading to permanent blindness (12). Abducens nerve palsy may occur as a false localizing sign in up to 10-20% of cases of IIH (13), and cranial nerve III (14), IV (15), V (16), and VII (17) palsies have also been reported.\nAccording to Dandy's Modified Criteria for the diagnosis of IIH, the neurological examination should be otherwise normal (2,13,18,19). In addition to the signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure above, patients with IIH should also have an increased CSF pressure (>250 mm H2O) but normal CSF composition, normal neuroradiological imaging, and exclusion of other causes of elevated intracranial pressure (2,13,18,19).\nA key feature of IIH is that it is a diagnosis of exclusion. Because of the significant morbidity and mortality associated with intracranial hypertension, it is critical to rule out other potential causes of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Smith and Caldemeyer (20) present a differential diagnosis for increased ICP stratified into three components: 1) increased brain volume (tumor, infarction, hemorrhage, infection, hepatic disease, white matter disease); 2) increased CSF (obstructive hydrocephalus, non-obstructive hydrocephalus, overproduction hydrocephalus, normal pressure hydrocephalus, IIH); and 3) increased blood volume (increased central venous pressure, dural sinus thrombosis). All other causes must be excluded before the diagnosis of IIH may be entertained.\nAlthough the pathogenesis of IIH is uncertain, hypotheses generally revolve around the same three components of increased ICP noted by Smith and Caldemeyer (20). Studies have demonstrated cerebral edema (21,22) associated with increased cerebral free water (23) in cases of IIH. This finding is postulated in the context of impaired CSF absorption at the arachnoid villi (19,24,25), increased CSF production (26), or increased intracranial blood volume (25,27), the latter thought secondary to venous outflow obstruction from increased subarachnoid pressure (1).\nLike pathogenesis, the etiology of IIH is similarly uncertain. Obesity and weight gain are modifiable factors that have been significantly associated with IIH in epidemiological studies (7,8) – our patient was clearly atypical in this regard. Demographic factors such as female gender and reproductive age have been associated with an increased risk for IIH, as well. A population-based study from Rochester, Minnesota observed an adjusted annual incidence of 0.9 cases per 100,000 persons, with an annual rate of 1.6 cases per 100,000 females and 3.3 cases per 100,000 females 15-44 years of age (4). Other incidence studies have noted crude annual rates ranging from 0.9 - 1.7 cases per 100,000 persons, with rates approximately 1.5 to 2-fold higher among all females and approximately 3 to 6-fold higher among females 15-44 years of age (4-6) when compared with overall rates.\nRadhakrishnan et al. present a variety of additionally described risk factors of varying strength, including the coexistence of endocrinopathies, menstrual irregularities, autoimmune disorders, chronic renal failure, and concurrent medication use - such as steroids, estrogens, Vitamin A, thyroid supplements and antibiotics - among patients with IIH (1). These authors suggest that patients developing IIH may possess an underlying abnormality or predisposition which, when acting in concert with an aggravating agent such as recent weight gain or antibiotic use, produces the disease (1).\nTetracyclines, with minocycline in particular, are among the more frequently described offending agents. Some authors have even suggested that periodic ophthalmologic examination in patients combining tetracyclines with vitamin A should be considered to detect IIH (28). Minocycline, used by the patient in this report, has been described in association with IIH in over 30 cases (28,29,30,31,32,33,34). Presumably, the higher lipophilicity of minocycline when compared to other tetracyclines allows greater penetration of the blood-brain barrier, resulting in higher CSF concentrations and perhaps its association with IIH (34).\nTherapy for IIH is generally directed at removing the precipitating factors and intervening on visual disturbances. Critical to overall management is the recognition that IIH is a diagnosis of exclusion that requires careful ophthalmologic and neurological follow-up through resolution of signs and symptoms. Given the possibility of significant visual sequelae, close monitoring with medical or surgical management as needed is reasonable. Acetazolamide, thought to reduce CSF production, is the medication most frequently used, while corticosteroids and serial lumbar puncture have also been utilized (1). Surgical interventions through lumboperitoneal shunt or optic nerve sheath fenestration have been used with rapid or progressive visual loss (1,12). An atypical course should be aggressively evaluated, as Aroichane et al suggest in their report of glioblastoma multiforme which mimicked IIH early in its presentation in a 16-year-old female utilizing minocycline for acne (35).\nAlthough idiopathic intracranial hypertension is an uncommon condition, cases may present to urgent care or emergency facilities as our patient did. Recognition of IIH among the differential diagnoses and appropriate exclusion of other possible conditions is critical in this setting, as is triage for further management and follow-up. An awareness of potentially predisposing conditions for IIH, such as specific medication usage or other risk factors, should assist the physician in guiding management to further evaluate symptoms consistent with this illness. Symptoms are commonly related to the increased intracranial pressure and include headache, visual changes, intracranial noises and abducens nerve palsies. Sequelae of IIH may be severe, so intervention and therapy are directed at identification and removal of offending agents and reversal of modifiable risk factors. Follow-up should be arranged for further evaluation as needed, as well as close neurological and ophthalmologic monitoring for the early detection of possible visual loss."", 'Hypertension Dubai or a high blood pressure is a very common condition that is easily diagnosed. The old maxim of “100 plus your age” is not a safe way to measure what your blood pressure should be. Hypertension exists when the blood\nHigh blood pressure, or hypertension, rarely has noticeable symptoms. But if untreated, it increases your risk of serious problems such as heart attacks and strokes. The only way to find out if your blood pressure is high is to have your blood pressure checked.\nWHAT IS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE?\nBlood pressure is recorded with 2 numbers. The systolic pressure (higher number) is the force at which your heart pumps blood around your body.\nThe diastolic pressure (lower number) is the resistance to the blood flow in the blood vessels.\nThey’re both measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg).\nAs a general guide:\n– high blood pressure is considered to be 140/90mmHg or higher (or 150/90mmHg or higher if you’re over the age of 80)\n– ideal blood pressure is usually considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg\nBlood pressure readings between 120/80mmHg and 140/90mmHg could mean you’re at risk of developing high blood pressure if you do not take steps to keep your blood pressure under control.\nEveryone’s blood pressure will be slightly different. What’s considered low or high for you may be normal for someone else.\nRISKS OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE\nIf your blood pressure is too high, it puts extra strain on your blood vessels, heart and other organs, such as the brain, kidneys and eyes.\nPersistent high blood pressure can increase your risk of a number of serious and potentially life-threatening health conditions, such as:\n– heart disease\n– heart attacks\n– heart failure\n– peripheral arterial disease\n– aortic aneurysms\n– kidney disease\n– vascular dementia\nIf you have high blood pressure, reducing it even a small amount can help lower your risk of these health conditions.\nTHINGS THAT CAN INCREASE YOUR RISK OF GETTING HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE\nIt’s not always clear what causes high blood pressure, but there are things that can increase your risk.\nYou might be more at risk if you:\n– are overweight\n– eat too much salt and do not eat enough fruit and vegetables\n– do not do enough exercise\n– drink too much alcohol or coffee (or other caffeine-based drinks)\n– do not get much sleep or have disturbed sleep\n– are over 65\n– have a relative with high blood pressure\n– are of black African or black Caribbean descent\nMaking healthy lifestyle changes can sometimes help reduce your chances of getting high blood pressure and help lower your blood pressure if it’s already high.\nTREATMENT FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE\nDr Barbara Karin Vela can help you keep your blood pressure to a safe level using:\n– lifestyle changes\nWhat works best is different for each person. Talk to her to help you decide about treatment.\nLIFESTYLE CHANGES TO REDUCE BLOOD PRESSURE\nThese lifestyle changes can help prevent and lower high blood pressure:\n– reduce the amount of salt you eat and have a generally healthy diet\n– cut back on alcohol\n– lose weight if you’re overweight\n– exercise regularly\n– cut down on caffeine\n– stop smoking\nSome people with high blood pressure may also need to take 1 or more medicines to stop their blood pressure getting too high.\nMEDICINES FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE\nIf you’re diagnosed with high blood pressure, Dr Barbara Karin Vela may recommend taking 1 or more medicines to keep it under control.\nThese come as tablets and usually need to be taken once a day.\nCommon blood pressure medicines include:\nACE inhibitors – such as enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril and ramipril\nangiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs) – such as candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, valsartan and olmesartan\ncalcium channel blockers – such as amlodipine, felodipine and nifedipine or diltiazem and verapamil\ndiuretics – such as indapamide and bendroflumethiazide\nbeta blockers – such as atenolol and bisoprolol\nalpha blockers – such as doxazosin\nother diuretics – such as amiloride and spironolactone\nThe medicine recommended for you will depend on things like how high your blood pressure is, your age and your ethnicity.\nKNOWN CAUSES OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE\nIn about 1 in 20 cases, high blood pressure happens as the result of an underlying health condition or taking a certain medicine.\nHealth conditions that can cause high blood pressure include:\n– kidney disease\n– long-term kidney infections\n– obstructive sleep apnoea – where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, interrupting normal breathing\n– glomerulonephritis – damage to the tiny filters inside the kidneys\nnarrowing of the arteries supplying the kidneys\n– hormone problems – such as an underactive thyroid, an overactive thyroid, – Cushing’s syndrome, acromegaly, increased levels of the hormone aldosterone (hyperaldosteronism), and phaeochromocytoma\n– lupus – a condition in which the immune system attacks parts of the body, such as the skin, joints and organs\n– scleroderma – a condition that causes thickened skin, and sometimes problems with organs and blood vessels\nBeing active and taking regular exercise lowers blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition.\nRegular exercise can also help you lose weight, which will also help lower your blood pressure.\nAdults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as cycling or fast walking, every week.\nPhysical activity can include anything from sport to walking and gardening.\nSOME HYPERTENSION TERMS WORTH KNOWING\nEssential (primary) hypertension occurs when you have abnormally high blood pressure that’s not the result of a medical condition. This form of high blood pressure is often due to obesity, family history and an unhealthy diet. The condition is reversible with medications and lifestyle changes.\nGestational hypertension is a form of high blood pressure in pregnancy. It occurs in about 6 percent of all pregnancies. Another type of high blood pressure is chronic hypertension–high blood pressure that is present before pregnancy begins. Gestational hypertension can develop into preeclampsia.\nHBP is simply short for High Blood Pressure.\nHigh Blood Pressure\nHigh blood pressure is considered to be 140/90mmHg or higher (or 150/90mmHg or higher if you’re over the age of 80) ideal blood pressure is usually considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg.\nIdiopathic Intracranial Hypertension\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) happens when high pressure around the brain causes symptoms like vision changes and headaches. “Idiopathic” means the cause isn’t known, “intracranial” means in the skull, and “hypertension” means high pressure.\nIntracranial hypertension (IH) is a build-up of pressure around the brain. It can happen suddenly, for example, as the result of a severe head injury, stroke or brain abscess. This is known as acute IH. It can also be a persistent, long-lasting problem, known as chronic IH.\nLow Blood Pressure\nLow blood pressure is a reading of less than 90/60mmHg. It does not always cause symptoms, but you may need treatment if it does.\nMalignant hypertension is very high blood pressure that comes on suddenly and quickly. The kidneys filter wastes and excrete fluid when the pressure of blood in the bloodstream forces blood through the internal structures of the kidney.\nPortal hypertension is elevated pressure in your portal venous system. The portal vein is a major vein that leads to the liver. The most common cause of portal hypertension is cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver.\nPulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs (pulmonary arteries). It’s a serious condition that can damage the right side of the heart. The walls of the pulmonary arteries become thick and stiff, and cannot expand as well to allow blood through.']"	['<urn:uuid:9361e878-546b-4ab1-831e-a29c7cfcaa51>', '<urn:uuid:338f04fd-55d2-4e9f-812e-484948fc82cb>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	29	90	2990
20	I study migrations and was wondering how droughts affect traditional farming communities, and what issues they face when forced to move to new places?	Droughts severely impact traditional farming communities' land productivity and livelihoods, as seen in cases like Syria where droughts from 2006-2010 contributed to an agrarian crisis. When land degradation occurs, many farmers are forced to migrate - studies show that poor harvests force 40% of households worldwide to relocate. When these communities are displaced, they face significant challenges. For example, in cases like the Pedi people in South Africa, forced relocations led to overcrowding in new areas, making it impossible to sustain traditional subsistence farming. This often results in male members having to seek wage labor in distant locations, disrupting traditional family structures and agricultural practices. Additionally, such displacement and migration can contribute to political instability and conflict, particularly in regions with fragile dry lands experiencing declining fertility.	['Pedi (also known as Bapedi, Bamaroteng, Marota, Basotho, Northern Sotho) – in its broadest sense – is a cultural/linguistic term. Northern Sotho was previously used to describe the entire set of people speaking various dialects of the Sotho language who live in the Limpopo Province of South Africa, but more recently the term “Pedi” has replaced “Northern Sotho” to characterise this loose collectivity of groups. The Northern Sotho have been subdivided into the high-veld Sotho, which are comparatively recent immigrants mostly from the west and southwest, and the low-veld Sotho, who combine immigrants from the north with inhabitants of longer standing. The high-veld Sotho include the Pedi (in the narrower sense), Tau, Kone, Roka, Ntwane, Mphahlele, Tšhwene, Mathabathe, Kone (Ga-Matlala), Dikgale, Batlokwa, Gananwa (Ga-Mmalebogo), Mmamabolo, and Moletši. The low-veld Sotho include the Lobedu, Narene, Phalaborwa, Mogoboya, Kone, Kgakga, Pulana, Pai, and Kutswe. Groups are named by using the names of totemic animals and, sometimes, by alternating or combining these with the names of famous chiefs. Pedi in the narrowest sense, refers more to a political unit than to a cultural or linguistic one: the Pedi polity included the people living within the area over which the Maroteng dynasty established dominance during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Even this narrower usage should not be understood in a rigid sense because many fluctuations occurred in the extent of this polity’s domination during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and processes of relocation and labour migration have resulted in the widespread scattering of its former subjects.\nThe present-day Pedi area, Sekhukhuneland, is situated between the Olifants River (Lepelle) and its tributary the Steelpoort River (Tubatse); bordered on the east by the Drakensberg range, and crossed by the Leolo mountains. But at the height of its power the Pedi polity under Thulare (about 1790–1820) included an area stretching from the site of present-day Rustenburg in the east to the lowveld in the west, and ranging as far south as the Vaal river. The area under Pedi control was severely limited when the polity was defeated by British troops in 1879. Reserves were created for this and for other northern Sotho groups by the Transvaal Republic’s Native Location Commission. Over the next hundred years or so, these reserves were then variously combined and separated by a succession of government planners. By 1972 this planning had culminated in the creation of an allegedly independent national unit or “homeland” named Lebowa. In terms of the government’s plans to accommodate ethnic groups separately from each other, this was designed to act as a place of residence for all northern Sotho speakers. But many Pedi had never resided here: since the polity’s defeat, they had become involved in a series of labour-tenancy or sharecropping arrangements with white farmers, lived as tenants on crown land, or purchased farms communally as freeholders, or moved to live in the townships adjoining Pretoria and Johannesburg on a permanent or semi-permanent basis. In total, however, the population of the Lebowa homeland increased rapidly after the mid 1950s, due to the forced relocations from rural areas and cities in common South Africa undertaken by apartheid’s planners, and to voluntary relocations by which former labour tenants sought independence from the restrictive and deprived conditions under which they had lived on the white farms.\nThe complex multiplicity of groups described above already co-existed in the northern and north-eastern Transvaal by the end of the eighteenth century, and some concentration of political authority was already in place. In the course of their migrations into and around this area, clusters of people from diverse origins had gradually concentrated themselves around a series of dikgoro (s. kgoro) or ruling nuclear groups: identifying themselves through their shared symbolic allegiance to a totemic animal – tau (lion), kolobe (pig), kwena (crocodile) and others. The Maroteng or Pedi, with their symbolic animal noko (porcupine), were an offshoot of the Tswana-speaking Kgatla. In about 1650 they had settled in an area to the south of the Tubatse river and of their present heartland. Here, over several generations of interaction, a degree of linguistic and cultural homogeneity developed. Only in the later half of the 18th century did they extend control over the region, establishing the Pedi paramountcy by bringing powerful neighbouring chiefdoms under their sway. Pedi power, at its height during Thulare’s reign, (about 1790–1820) was undermined during the period of the difaqane by Ndwandwe invaders from the south-east. A period of dislocation followed, after which the polity was restabilised under Thulare’s son Sekwati, who engaged in numerous negotiations and struggles for control over land and labour with the Afrikaans-speaking farmers (Boers) who had since settled in the region. Sekwati’s success in these struggles, and later that of his heir, Sekhukhune I, was due in part to the firepower enjoyed by the polity, bought with proceeds of early labour migration to the Kimberley diamond fields. The Pedi paramountcy’s power was entrenched through its insistence that the chiefs of subordinate groups take their principal wives from the ruling dynasty. The resulting system of cousin marriage perpetuated hierarchical marriage links between ruler and ruled and involved paying inflated bridewealth to the Maroteng. By the 1870s, the Pedi represented one of three alternative sources of regional authority, alongside the Swazi and the ZAR (Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek) which the Boers had established. Intensifying struggles between Boers and Pedi over land and labour resulted in the war of 1876, in which the Boer and Swazi forces were defeated. British annexation of the Transvaal, partly spurred by the Boers’ failure to subjugate the Pedi, followed in 1877, and the Pedi were finally defeated by British troops and Swazi allies under the command of Sir Garnet Wolsely in November 1879 . Sekhukhune was captured and held in Pretoria until 1881. The following year he was assassinated by a rival Pedi notable. The Berlin Missionary Society established the first mission to the Pedi, west of the Leolo mountains, in 1861, after which the missionary Alexander Merensky left the area to establish a village for converts, Botšhabelo (the place of refuge), to the south-west of the Pedi area. Johannes Dinkwanyane, half-brother of Sekhukhune, was an influential early convert, and lived for some time at Botshabelo. From here, several groups of converts later left to purchase land and found their own independent communities – including Doornkop and Boomplaats. Here Christian Pedi continued living until they were forcibly removed into the Pedi reserve during the 1960s–70s in the interests of “ethnic consolidation”. In more recent times, there has been mission activity by Catholic, Anglican, and Dutch Reformed missionaries.\nIn pre-conquest times, people settled on elevated sites in relatively large villages, divided into kgoro (pl. dikgoro, groups centred on agnatic family clusters). Each consisted of a group of households, in huts built around a central area which served as meeting-place, cattle byre, graveyard and ancestral shrine. Households’ huts were ranked in order of seniority. Each wife of a polygynous marriage had her own round thatched hut, joined to other huts by a series of open-air enclosures (lapa) encircled by mud walls. Older boys and girls, respectively, would be housed in separate huts. Aspirations to live in a more modern style, along with practicality, have led most families to abandon the round hut style for rectangular, flat-tin-roofed houses. Processes of forced and semi-voluntary relocation, and an apartheid government planning scheme implemented in the name of “betterment”, have meant that many newer settlements, and the outskirts of many older ones, consist of houses built in grid-formation, occupied by individual families unrelated to their neighbours. Such living arrangements have not changed substantially since the advent of democracy in 1994\nSubsistence and economy\nPre-conquest economy combined cattle-keeping with hoe cultivation. Principal crops were sorghum, pumpkins and legumes, which were grown by women on fields allocated to them when they married. Women hoed and weeded; did pottery and built and decorated huts with mud; made sleeping mats and baskets; ground grain, cooked, brewed, and collected water and wood. Men did some work in fields at peak times; hunted and herded; did woodwork, prepared hides, and were metal workers and smiths. Most major tasks were done communally by matsema (work-parties). The chief was depended upon to perform rain-making for his subjects. The introduction of the animal-drawn plough, and of maize, later transformed the labour division significantly, especially when combined with the effects of labour migration. Men’s leaving home to work for wages was initially undertaken by regimental groups of youths to satisfy the paramount’s firepower requirements, but later became increasingly necessary to individual households as population increase within the reserve and land degradation made it impossible to subsist from cultivation alone. Despite increasingly long absences, male migrants nonetheless remained committed to the maintenance of their fields: ploughing had now to be carried out during periods of leave, or entrusted to professional ploughmen or tractor owners. Women were left to manage and carry out all other agricultural tasks. Men, although subjected to increased controls in their lives as wage-labourers, fiercely resisted all direct attempts to interfere with the sphere of cattle-keeping and agriculture. Their resistance erupted in open rebellion – ultimately subdued – during the 1950s. In later decades, some families have continued to practise cultivation and to keep stock. These activities should more accurately be seen as demonstrating a long-term commitment to the rural social system to gain security in retirement than as providing a viable form of household subsistence. In the early 1960s, about 48% of the male population was absent as wage-earners at any given time. Between the 1930s and the 1960s, most Pedi men would spend a short period working on nearby white farms followed by a move to employment on the mines or domestic service and later – especially in more recent times – to factories or industry. Female wage employment began more recently, and is rarer and more sporadic. Some women work for short periods on farms, others have begun, since the 1960s, to work in domestic service in the towns of the Witwatersrand. But in recent years there have been rising levels of education and of expectation, combined with a sharp drop in employment rates. Many youths, better-educated than their parents and hoping for jobs as civil servants or teachers, stand little chance of getting employment of any kind.\nAncestors are viewed as intermediaries between humans and The Creator or God (Modimo/Mmopi)and are communicated to by calling on them using a process of burning incense, making an offering and speaking to them (go phasa). Animal sacrifice or the presenting of beer to the shades, on both the mother’s and father’s side can be done if necessary. A key figure in family ritual was the kgadi (father’s older sister primarily). The position of ngaka (diviner) was formerly inherited patrilineally, but is now commonly inherited by a woman from her paternal grandfather or great-grandfather. This is often manifested through illness and through violent possession by spirits (malopo)of the body, the only cure for which is to train as a diviner. There is a proliferation of diviners in recent times, with many said to be motivated mainly by a desire for material gain.\nImportant crafts included metal smithing, beadwork, pottery, house-building and painting, woodworking (especially the making of drums). Pedi music (mmino wa setso: traditional music, lit. music of origin) has a six-note scale. Formerly played on a plucked reed instrument called dipela, its musicians now make use of trade-store instruments such as the jaw harp, and the German autoharp (harepa), which have come to be regarded as typically Pedi. The peak of Pedi (and northern Sotho) musical expression is arguably the kiba genre, which has transcended its rural roots to become a migrant style. In its men’s version it features an ensemble of players, each playing an aluminium end-blown pipe of a different pitch (naka, pl. dinaka) and together producing a descending melody that mimics traditional vocal songs with richly harmonised qualities. In the women’s version, a development of earlier female genres which has recently been included within the definition of kiba, a group of women sings songs (koša ya dikhuru- loosely translated: knee-dance music). This translation has it roots in the traditional kneeling dance that involve salacious shaking movements of the breast area accompanied by chants. These dances are still very common among Tswana, Sotho and Nguni women. This genre comprises sets of traditional songs steered by a lead singer accompanied by a chorus and an ensemble of drums (meropa), previously wooden but now made of oil-drums and milk-urns. These are generally sung at drinking parties and/or during celebrations such as weddings.\nThe pre-colonial system of communal or tribal tenure, being broadly similar to that practised throughout the southern African region, was crystallised, but subtly altered, by the colonial administration. A man was granted land by the chief for each of his wives; unused land was reallocated by the chief, rather than being inherited within families. Overpopulation resulting from the government’s relocation policies resulted in this system being modified – a household’s fields, together with its residential plot, are now inherited, ideally by the youngest married son. Christian Pedi communities who owned freehold farms were removed to the reserve without compensation, but since 1994 South Africa many have now reoccupied their land or are preparing to do so, under restitution legislation. The few Pedi who still live as labour tenants on white farms have been promised some security of tenure by land reform legislation.\nKgoshi – a loose collection of kinsmen with related males at its core – was as much a jural unit as a kinship one, since membership was defined by acceptance of the kgoro-head’s authority rather than primarily by descent. Royal or chiefly kgoros sometimes underwent rapid subdivision as sons contended for positions of authority. Marriage was patrilocal. Polygyny was practised mostly by people of higher, especially chiefly, status. Marriage was preferred with a close or classificatory cousin, especially a mother’s brother’s daughter, but this preference was most often realised in the case of ruling or chiefly families. Practised by the ruling dynasty, during its period of dominance, it represented a system of political integration and control recycling of bridewealth (dikgomo di boela shakeng; returning of bride cattle). Cousin marriage meant that the two sets of prospective in-laws were closely connected even before the event of marriage, and went along with an ideology of sibling-linkage, through which the bohadi (bridewealth) procured for a daughter’s marriage would in turn be used to get a bride for her brother, and he would repay his sister by offering a daughter to her son in marriage. Cousin marriage is still practised, but less frequently. Polygyny too is now rare, many marriages end in divorce or separation, and a large number of young women remain single and raise their children in small (and often very poor) female-headed households. But new forms of domestic co-operation have come into being, often between brothers and sisters, or matrilineally linked relatives. Previously the oldest son of a household within a polygynous family would inherit the house-property of his mother, including its cattle, and was supposed to act as custodian of these goods for the benefit of the household’s other children. With the decline of cattle-keeping and the sharp increase in land-shortage, this has switched to a system of last-born inheritance, primarily of land. The life-cycle for both sexes was differentiated by important rituals. Both girls and boys underwent initiation. Boys (bašemane, later mašoboro) spent their youth looking after cattle at remote outposts, in the company of peers and older youths. Circumcision and initiation at koma (initiation school), held about once every five years, socialised youths into groups of cohorts or regiments (mephato) bearing the leader’s name, whose members then maintained lifelong loyalty to each other, and often travelled together to find work on the farms or on the mines. Girls attended their own koma and were initiated into their own regiments (ditswa-bothuku), usually two years after the boys. Initiation is still practised, and provides a considerable income to the chiefs who licence it for a fee or, in recent years, to private entrepreneurs who have established initiation schools beyond chiefs’ jurisdiction.\nThis article uses material from the Wikipedia article “Pedi People”, which is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike License 3.0', 'By Manipadma Jena\nANKARA, Turkey, Nov 5 2015 (IPS) – Some 135 million people could be displaced by 2045 as a result of land desertification, according to a recent UK ministry of defense report. This figure could rise to 200 million who are displaced by other climate change impacts like natural disasters by 2050, said British environment refugee specialist Norman Myers.\nThese could have been little more than debatable numbers until Syria’s civil war refugees rose exponentially to over 4 million, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, in a span of a little over 24 months, with more than 7.6 million internally displaced, together accounting for half of Syria’s population. As much distress and unrest that these figures have caused, they pale in comparison to the number of displaced that will likely occur due to desertification and climate change.\nUriel N Safriel, chair Committee on Science and Technology (CST) of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), voices the urgent and growing need to put on the table for policy makers, scientific studies linking land degradation, migration, conflict and political instability, now apparent in several other countries, notably in Africa.\n“Syria’s most parts are dry lands. Logically, and from experience there is likelihood not yet based on science that droughts which occurred in Syria and Iraq (2006 -2010) severely reduced the land productivity,” Safriel said.\n“Large sections of Syrians depend on land for their livelihood and this agrarian crisis maybe contributed to or even incited the conflict,” he added.\nA relatively new country, Syria’s borders were drawn by the British and French after the First World War, putting different ethnic groups in the same country, which triggered the political layer of the unrest.\n“Indirectly supporting that droughts triggered Syria’s conflict are studies from some other countries, not yet in global focus, one of them the island of Sicily and two others from Africa that find regions categorized as arid here have turned hyper-arid due to climate change as has been predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports,” Safriel said, adding, “Science can rightly claim land degradation is an important driver of migration because countries that generate the most migrants today are countries where predicted desertification and land degradation have materialized.”\nSimulations show that future agricultural gross domestic product (AGDP) losses in developing countries in Latin America and India would be as high as 8 – 14 per cent and 4 percent respectively. In Africa, Burkina Faso would see 20 per cent loss and Mali up to 30 per cent.\nThe two billion people living in the driest regions that constitute 41 per cent of Earth’s terrestrial surface are already touched by climate change impacts in varying degrees, according to UNCCD.\nSeasonal or temporary migration has intensified. Poor harvests are forcing four out of ten households worldwide to move, crop destruction forces 17 per cent to move while 13 per cent leave owing to strong climatic events including extreme droughts.\nIn the last 60 years, 40 per cent of intrastate conflicts were associated with land and natural resources such as water, say UNCCD reports.\nIn 2008, food insecurity triggered 60 riots in over 30 countries, 10 of which resulted in multiple deaths.\nLike Syria, beneath the surface of conflict and political instability in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Nigeria, Gambia, Senegal, Somalia, Eritrea and Sudan are fragile dry lands experiencing sharply declining fertility that have given rise to hunger, unemployment, lack of opportunity and finally to political breakdown.\nSeventy percent of countries in the world already declare climate change impacts like desertification and drought as security issues today.\nAccording to the UK ministry of defense report, given such a set of sociology-economic situations, areas with larger youth population are more susceptible to instability and conflict and chances of falling prey to radical extremists.\n“While migration has always been a natural adaptation mechanism, the difficulty faced today is that the drivers and fallouts of migration are getting complexly interlinked with climate and other sociopolitical factors,” said Safriel, adding, “The linkages between faulty land use, consequent land degradation and loss of livelihood as a potential migration driver are not clearly, or at all, presented by social scientists or at least not yet found in public domain.”\n“Even while we need more information about these linkages to know what drivers contribute most to migration, we know for sure that land degradation is the driver that can drive other drivers,” he said.\n“In turn land degradation itself has many drivers, one of them being climate change. A direct driver of land degradation is improper land use. Here the important question is why does a farmer degrade his own land? The answer is a set of other indirect drivers – political, policy, and demographics,” Safriel added.\nAccording to Safriel, what is also important is a farmer’s dependency on a stable market (for his products), which in turn depends on social, political and economic stability. Social and political scientists fail to explain why there are so few policies to really support the land users, he added.\nUN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimations say in the last 40 years nearly one-third of the world’s arable land has been lost to erosion. A 2015 report finds 12 million hectares of land continues to be lost every year where 20 million tonnes of grain could have grown instead.\nTo feed an estimated world population of 9.7 billion by 2050, agricultural production must increase 70 percent and by 100 percent in developing countries over 2005 – 2050.\nExperts caution unless we change the way we manage our land, in the next 30 years a billion vulnerable people will have little choice but to fight or flee.']	['<urn:uuid:66c351e8-6027-447f-97ca-eb6113b1303d>', '<urn:uuid:862c06f1-ac6c-43cb-93f1-096cf29f8f3c>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	24	127	3655
21	I collect Asian art and wonder why Buddha sometimes carries bag	In artistic depictions, Budai (sometimes called the Laughing Buddha) carries a large linen bag that is filled with various precious items such as rice plants, candy for children, food, and symbolically, the sadness of the world. This bag is so significant that it's actually the source of Budai's name - 'Budai' means 'cloth bag'. As a wandering monk, he was known to take sadness from people and bring them happiness, carrying these items in his bag. When giving candy to children from his bag, he would only ask for a penny from monks or practitioners he met.	['Category Archives: Arhat\nAlso known as: 布袋, 笑佛 (Laughing Buddha), Hasne Buddha (Nepal), 胖佛 (Fat Buddha), Hotei (“cloth bag”) Japanese, Hotei-Osho (Japanese), Bo Dai or Bố Đại (Vietnamese), Hangul (Korean), Pu-Tai, Wagon Priest, Budai Luohan\nEtymology: Laughing Buddha, Fat Buddha, Cloth Sack\nIn Chinese folklore, Budai is a Buddhist deity who has been integrated into Buddhism, Taoism and Shinto religions. The historical Budai lived during the 10th century C.E.\nIn art, Budai is often shown as being a very fat, bald man wearing a robe, either wearing or carrying prayer beads and has a huge belly; seen as the symbol of abundance, contentment, happiness, luck and generosity. He carries a large linen bag holding a number of precious things, even children on his back. This same bag is the source of Budai’s name. Sometimes Budai is shown sitting in a cart being pulled by boys where he is known as the Wagon Priest.\nWith his nickname of the Laughing Buddha, Budai is frequently shown smiling or laughing. Budai’s image is often confused with that of Gautama Buddha with Westerners, where he gets the name of the Fat Buddha. In Japan, Budai becomes known as Hotei and is one of the Seven Lucky Gods or Shichi Fukujin.\nBudai Statues & Depictions\nAs already said, Budai is nearly always shown carrying a sack that is filled with a number of precious things such as rice plants, candy for children, food and the sadness of the world.\nIn Buddhist temples throughout China, statues of Budai are placed in the front part of the entrance halls. Budai is frequently shown as a stough, smiling or laughing man wearing a robe that is unable to cover his large belly. This large belly represents happiness, good luck and abundance. Some Budai statues will have small children gathered around at his feet. Another common feature of Budai statues is a begging bowl, that clearly shows him to be a Buddhist.\nBecause of Budai’s great association with happiness and wealth, statues of Budai can be found in many businesses and homes in China and Japan.\nI Kuan Tao – Budai statues are a central part of I Kuan Tao shrines. Here, Budai is known by his Sanskrit name of Maitreya.\nBudai represents the teachings of contentment, generosity, wisdom and kind-heartedness. He is also associated with luck and abundance.\nBudai is the guardian and protector of children, the weak and poor. As a wandering monk, Budai is known to take sadness from people and bring them happiness.\nChinese history holds that Budai had been an eccentric Chan monk who lived during the late Liang dynasty. He had been a native of Zhejiang or Fenghua and his Buddhist name was Qieci, meaning: “Promise This.” Budai or Qieci was regarded as a man of good and loving character.\nIn Buddhism, the term Buddha means: “one who is awake,” as in awakened to enlightenment. There have been many figures in Buddhism who have all been revered as Buddhas. The Chan school of Buddhism teaches that all beings possess a Buddha nature within them and thus, already enlightened, they just have yet to realize it.\nA few Buddhist traditions view Budai as an incarnation of Buddha or a bodhisattva.\nAngida Arhat – One of the original Eighteen Arhats, meaning one who is worth or a perfected person, much like the Saints of Western Culture. In the Sakyamuni Buddhism, there is a legend wherein Angida is a talented Indian snake catcher would catch venomous snakes, thereby preventing them from biting travelers. Angida would remove the snake’s venomous fangs before releasing them. Due to these acts of kindness, Angida was able to attain bodhi or nirvana. In Chinese art, Angiha is sometimes depicted as Budhai; being rotund, mirthful and carrying a bag.\nGautama Buddha – The historical Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama lived during the 6th century B.C.E. in India, Nepal and much of southeast Asia. Here, Gautama is shown as being tall and slender in appearance. Whereas in China and other areas, Budai is consistently shown as being short and rotund. Both of these descriptions have been noted as being the idealized imagery of the different religions, cultural and folkloric traditions of the countries and regions after the two monks’ deaths. Many Westerners too, often confuse Budai with Gautama and Budai often does get equated or replace Gautama.\nMaitreya – The Future Buddha\nBudai is identified or seen as an incarnation of Maitreya, the future Buddha. In China, Budai’s image is often the main used to depict Maitreya. Among the Japanese, Maitreya is known as Miroku. There is a Buddhist hymn that Budai is to have spoken at his death that identifies him with Maitreya:\nMaitreya, the true Maitreya\nhas billions of incarnations.\nOften he is shown to people at the time;\nOther times they do not recognize him.\nMi-Lo-Fo – As Hotei, Budai is often confused with the Buddhist deity known as Mi-lo-Fo.\nPu-Tai – A Chinese monk that Budai came to be associated with, who due to their good nature, was seen as the incarnation for the bodhisattva or future Buddha, Maitreya. Due to how Pu-Tai is also portrayed with having a large, rotund belly, its easy to see how he came to be known as the Laughing Buddha and connected to Budai.\nChan, Seon And Zen\nChan is Chinese, Seon is Korean and Zen is Japanese, all three are the same philosophy.\nThe following koan, or short story is often told about Budai. One day, Budai was out traveling, giving candy to poor children. He would only a penny from any monks or lay practitioners he met with. One day, a monk approaches Budai and asks: “What is the meaning of Zen?” (Or Chan or Seon). Budai responded by dropping his bag. The monk continued with his questions. “How does one realize Zen?” At that, Budai picked up his bag and continued on his way.\nBudai is greatly admired for his congenial and jovial attitude, along with his generosity and philosophy of contentment.\nOne of the most persistent and popular beliefs is that of rubbing the statues of Budai to bring wealth, good luck and even prosperity.\nJapanese Religion & Folklore\nIn Japan, Budai becomes known as Hotei who was a Buddhist monk that lived during the 16th century. Like Budai, Hotei is still greatly associated with laughter and being called the Laughing Buddha. Chinese legend holds that Hotei had been a real person, whose name was Kaishi. While the date of his birth is unknown, Hotei death is given as being March 916. The Japanese began to believe in Hotei during the Edo era. Hotei was once a Zen priest who appearance and actions didn’t go along with his fellow Zen priests. He always looked like he was up to mischief and never had a permanent place to sleep. Hotei had no desire to be a Zen Master or to gather a following of disciples. He was known for walking the streets with a sack full of candy, fruits and doughnuts that he would give out to children. His bag would also hold the fortunes for those who believe in him. Among the Chinese, he is nicknamed: Cho-Tei-Shi or Ho-Tei-Shi, which means “bag of old clothes.”\nAccording to Japanese legend, before Zen Buddhism came to the islands, another Buddhist philosophy of questionable aesthetics was prevalent. This philosophy originated with the priest Miroku. Miroku was the patron of those who couldn’t be saved by the beliefs of Buddha. Later, Hotei’s arrival was seen and accepted by the Japanese as a second Miroku.\nLaughter – This is Hotei’s essence and teachings, he used laughter to impart wisdom. This was not the laughter of laughing at jokes or making fun of others. Hotei would laugh at himself and laugh for the mere celebration of life and existence, for the joy of life. Hotei has no other philosophy, scriptures, dogmas, ideologies or any other precepts to teach. Hotei’s laughter is considered a form of meditation, to experience the joy of living and to just be living and being present in the moment.\nPeople would gather around Hotei as at first, they thought he was mad with how often he laugh and his laugh was known for being infectious in that others would soon laugh along with him. Such was Hotei’s laughter that people would cease to be judgmental or ask questions about enlightened. People would wait for Hotei and his laughter as they found it to have a purifying quality to it that would impart a deep sense of well-being.\nOne story about Hotei has a villager finding him sitting beneath a tree with his eyes closed. When the villager asked why Hotei wasn’t smiling or laughing, Hotei answered that he was preparing, preparing himself for laughter as he needed go within, forget the world without and recharge himself with rest. Once he was well rested, Hotei would be ready to laugh again.\nThailand Religion & Folklore\nPhra Sangkajai – Also spelled Phra Sangkachai. Budai is sometimes equated with the monk Phra Sangkajai. Both Budai and Phra Sangkajai can be found Thai and Chinese temples. Though Phra Sangkajai can be found more often in Thai temples and Budai in Chinese temples. While very similar in appearance, Phra Sangkajai is distinguished from Budai in that he has a thin trace of hair while Budai is bald. Their styles of dress are also different, Phra Sangkajai is dressed in robes folded across one shoulder, with the other bare. Budai’s robes are clearly a Chinese style that covers both of his arms and front part of his upper body uncovered.\nPhra Sangkajai is credited with composing the Madhupinadika Sutra. Buddha is said to have praised Phra Sangkajai for his excellence and understanding with explaining the more sophisticated dharma in easy and correct, understandable manners.\nA folk story about Phra Sangkajai tells how he was so handsome, that a man once wanted to marry Phra Sangkajai and take him for a wife. To avoid this situation, Phra Sangkajai changed his appearance to that of a fat monk. Another story tells how Phra Sangkajai was found to be so attractive, that both men and angels would compare him to the Buddha. Phra Sangkajai considered this inappropriate, changed his body so he would be rather fat.\nFirst off, Yiguandao is a folk religion out of China that got started around the late 19th century.\nIn many Yiguandao shrines, statues of Budai or Maitreya as he is known can be found. In Yiguandao, Maitreya represents a number of teachings such as: contentment, generosity, wisdom and open kind-heartedness. It is believed that Maitreya will succeed Gautama Buddha as the next Buddha and help people to realize their own spiritual essence within that connects everyone.\nShichi Fukujin – Seven Lucky Gods\nIn Japan, the Seven Lucky Gods or Seven Gods of Fortune, known as Shichi Fukujin are believed to granters of good luck and fortune. The Shichi Fukujin are often depicted in Japanese art and engravings known as netsuke. While many of the Shichi Fukujin are believed to be mythical in nature, one Shichi Fukujin is a known historical figure. Over the course of Japan’s history, the Shichi Fukujin became more associated with specific professions and aspects. Many of these same gods also originate from different countries and religions such as Hinduism and India to Chinese Buddhism and Taoism before coming to Japan. There are also seven Shichi Fukujin as seven in Japan is a lucky number.\nWhile the gods had been worshipped for over a thousand years, mainly by merchants, they were first collectively called the Shichi Fukujin in 1420 C.E. It’s believed the Buddhist priest Tenkai arranged and selected these deities after talking with the shogun, Iemitsu Tokugawa. The selection was based on the following virtues of: longevity, fortune, popularity, sincerity, kindness, dignity and magnanimity.\nBenzaiten – Often claimed as the only female deity among the Shichi Fukujin, Benzaiten originates in Hinduism where she had been the goddess Saraswati. Other names for Benzaiten are: Benten, Bentensama and Benzaitennyo. When she was adopted into Buddhism, Benzaiten became the associated with talent, beauty and music. Benzaiten is the patron of artists, writers, dancers and geishas. She is often seen as an intelligent, beautiful woman standing before a Torri, carrying a biwa, a traditional Japanese lute-style instrument and is accompanied by a white snake.\nBishamonten – A god originating in Hinduism where he had been the god Kubera and Vaisravana before becoming Bishamonten in Japanese culture. Bishamonten is the god of fortune in war and battles. He is also associated with authority and dignity, the protector of those who follow the rules and hold themselves accordingly. He is the protector of holy sites and other important places. Bishamonten is the patron of fighters and is often shown dressed in armor and helmet, carrying a pagoda in his left hand and a spear in his right hand to battle evil spirits. Bishamonten is also shown with a hoop of fire.\nDaikokuten – The god of commerce and prosperity. He was also known as the patron of cooks, farmers, bankers and protected crops. Daikokuten was known too for hunting demons. There is a legend of how Daikokuten hung a sacred talisman from a tree branch in his garden to use as a trap for catching a demon. Daikokuten is often depicted with short legs, perpetual smile and wearing a hat on his head and often carrying a bag full of valuables.\nEbisu – The only purely Japanese god in the group, he is the god of prosperity, wealth in business, abundance in crops, cereals and food. Ebisu is the patron of fishermen and he is often dressed as a fisherman carrying a fishing rod in his right hand and the left holding a fish. Ebisu’s figure can often be found in restaurants where fish is served or in kitchens.\nFukurokuju – Originating in China, Fukurokuju is believed to have once been a hermit who lived during the Song dynasty. Fukurokuju is seen as the reincarnation of the Taoist god Hsuan-wu. As a god, Fukurokuju is the god of wisom, luck, longevity, wealth and happiness. In addition, he is thought to be one of the Chinese philosophers who could live without eating and was able to resurrect the dead. Fukurokuju is noted for having a head that is almost the same size as his body. He is often shown dressed in traditional Chinese attire, carrying a cane in one hand and a scroll containing historical writings. Fukurokuju is often shown being accompanied by a turtle, crow or deer, all animals that represent a long life. With a strong love for chess, Fukurokuju is also the patron of chess players. Fukurokuju, along with Jurojin both overlap with their origins with the Chinese Taoist god Nanjilaoren. Due to this overlapping, Fukurokuju’s position as one of the Shichi Fukujin is sometimes given to the goddess Kichijoten in the Butsuzozu compendium.\nHotei – This is the Japanese name for Budai. As Hotei, he is the god of fortune, the guardian of children, happiness, laughter, popularity and the patron of diviners and barmen. Hotei is often shown as a fat, smiling bald man with a curly mustache. Because he is so fat, Hotei is often shown as being half naked as his clothes aren’t quite big enough to cover his large belly.\nJurojin – Like Fukurokujin, he has his origins in the Chinese Taoist god Nanjilaoren. He is the god of the elderly and longevity in the Japanese Buddhist mythology. Jurojin is believed to be based on a real person, he was very tall, 1.82 meters with a very long head, much like Fukurokuju. Aside from his elongated skull, Jurojin is also shown to have a long white beard and rides a deer and is sometimes accompanied by a crane and tortoise, all animals that represent a long life. Jurojin is sometimes shown sitting under a peach tree, another symbol of long life. In one hand, he holds a cane, in the other he holds either a book or scroll containing the wisdom of the world. Jurojin is known to enjoy rice and wine and has a rather cheerful disposition. Finally, Jurojin is an incarnation of the southern polestar.\nKichijoten – Also known as Kisshoten or Kisshoutennyo. Kichijoten was adopted into Buddhism from the Hindu goddess Lakshmi. Kichijoten is shown holding a Nyoihoju gem in her hand. The Butsuzozu compendium from 1783 lists and has Kichijoten replace Fukurokuju as one of the seven Shichi Fukujin. By this accounting, Daikoku is portrayed as being feminine and all three of the Hindu Tridevi goddesses are seen represented among the Shichi Fukujin.']	['<urn:uuid:95526c46-7ba8-4d48-8ded-ca32bbdbb152>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	11	97	2775
22	In music notation, what's the difference between how thirty-second notes and eighth notes are visually connected to other notes of the same type?	Thirty-second notes have three beams when connected to other notes, while eighth notes use a single beam. When not connected, thirty-second notes have three flags, whereas eighth notes have one flag.	"[""READING MUSIC WITH WEBRHYTHMS\nWelcome to WebRhythms - an easy step-by-step method for learning to read rhythm, created by Vic Firth artist and educator Norm Weinberg. Starting at the very beginning, you'll progress through 20 lessons, where each introduces a new topic. By the end of the series, you'll be a master at reading rhythm!\nIn this WebRhythms lesson, you'll learn to read 32nd notes. The exercise you'll be working on in this lesson will include audio play-along tracks in five different levels that you can use to track your progress!\nLook out! Here come those notes with lots of beams. Okay, okay, I know that for some players, looking at a page full of beams can be a pretty scary experience. But relax, additional beams don’t necessarily mean you’re going to have to play so fast that your sticks turn into kindling. More often than not, music that makes use of thirty-second notes moves at a slower pace than music using longer note values.\nWe’ll start with the basics. First, let’s talk about what thirty-second notes look like and what they do. Thirty-second notes have three flags whenever they aren’t connected to any other notes. Most often though, you’ll see thirty-seconds that have three beams instead of three flags. Free-standing thirty-second notes are rare. Similar to the way that sixteenths are grouped, thirty-seconds are beamed together into groupings that visually indicate the counts.\nWhat do thirty-second notes do? Just as eighth notes divide quarters into two equal parts and sixteenth notes divide eighths into two equal parts, thirty-seconds divide each sixteenth into two equal parts. To look at this in another way, remember that in common time there are four sixteenth notes to each quarter. And since there are two thirty-seconds to each sixteenth, there will be eight thirty-seconds in a single count.\nPerforming a full count’s worth of thirty-second notes is truly easy. Just count a group of four sixteenth notes (1 e + a) and play those syllables with your right hand. Now, place a left hand stroke in between each one of those syllables. If you did this correctly, you’ve just played eight notes between counts one and two, and you’ve performed a set of thirty-second notes. Congratulations! See, that wasn’t so hard.\nIf you played the last WebRhythm exercise in cut time, you’ve actually got a jump on understanding thirty-seconds. In cut time, eighth notes get the syllables of “1 e + a” as they divide each of the two main counts into four equal parts. The sixteenth notes that were in the exercise forced you to play two strokes for each of those syllables. In effect, you were playing the same rhythm of thirty-seconds (eight equal divisions of each count) even though the notes themselves were written as sixteenths.\nTake a look at example 1 and you’ll see how thirty-second notes (the stems-up notes with three beams) relate to the other types of values that you already know. Notice that there are eight thirty-seconds to each quarter, four thirty-seconds to each eighth, and two thirty-seconds to each sixteenth note.\nNow that you know how thirty-seconds operate, let’s discuss a counting system for them. Example 2 shows two different ways to approach the counting of thirty-seconds. In the first measure, you’ll see that the thirty-second notes aren’t really counted at all. Instead, you simply use your common sense to tell you how to place two notes on each of the same syllables that are used for sixteenths.\nDon’t forget that any note, including thirty-seconds, can be replaced with the same value of rest. In example 4, you’ll find some additional figures that include sixteenth and thirty-second rests. For this example, there are no counts written below the notes. To “solve” these measures, think about the value and the length of each note. Rhythms of this complexity usually move very slowly, so don’t try playing this too fast.\nOne last type of figure is presented in example 5. Here, four thirty-seconds are connected to a set of three sixteenth note triplets. In the first figure, the thirty-seconds begin on the first half of the count and the triplet begins on the “and” syllable. The second figure is just the reverse, with the triplet starting on the “number” syllable and the thirty-seconds starting on the “and”.\nJust as an aside – since things are starting to get a bit more complicated, it might be a good time to review some of the practice suggestions presented in earlier lessons.\nBe certain that the speed of your counts is steady and consistent. There should be no pause between figures, measures or between lines. Take the exercise very slowly at first and have a successful experience. If you’re having trouble, SLOW DOWN! Set yourself some realistic goals. Then pat yourself on the back and play it again. Play it again, and again, and again. If you play this exercise fifty times in a row without errors, then you can be very confident that the fifty-first time will also be perfect.\nCounting out loud will serve as additional feedback to your ears and your eyes that everything is going along okay. As you count, keep your verbal syllables short and crisp so you can hear where the sound is supposed to occur. If you draw out the verbal count, it becomes harder to synchronize the sound of the drum to the sound of the count. Always try to keep your eyes in front of your hands. This means that while your hands are playing count one, your eyes need to be looking at count two (at least)."", '[ prev] [ Table of Contents] [next]\nEighth notes, sixteenth notes and other faster note values have flags attached to the stem of the note. When two or more in a row of these faster note values are notated the flags are often replaced by a beam. Notes that use beams instead of flags must be beamed together in relationship to the pulse. One purpose of the beaming is to show the reader the grouping of note values as they relate to the beat structure of the meter. Beamed note groups should usually start at the beginning of a beat and the beam should stop at the end of the beat. The following examples will illustrate the concept of correct beaming.\nIn the first 4/4 example, each pair of eighth notes in the first measure can be beamed together because the first of each pair begins on the beat. However, in the second measure notice that the first eighth note is not beamed because it is on the second half of the second beat (it is not on the beginning of a beat). The next two eighth notes are beamed together because they are within the third beat of the measure and, more importantly, the first of that pair begins on the beat. The first note of a beamed group should begin on the beat (an exception to this rule will be shown later).\nIn the first measure of the next example, all four sixteenth notes of the third beat can be beamed together because the first sixteenth of that group begins on the beat and the entire group makes up one full beat. In the second measure notice that the four sixteenth notes are not beamed together but instead the first two sixteenth notes are beamed with the eighth note in the second beat and the next two sixteenth notes are beamed with an eighth note in the third beat. Notice that in each case the beamed groups begin on the beat and the beamed group lasts for one complete beat.\nCombining sixteenth notes and eighth notes (or dotted eighth notes) in beamed groups is common in music notation and below are some of the typical rhythmic figures. In each example it is assumed that the first note of the beamed group begins on the beat.\nAs mentioned above sometimes a beamed group does not begin on the beat. The following is an example of this type of beaming.\nEven though the sixteenth notes do not begin on the beat they can still be beamed together\nBeaming in compound meter has a different look than simple meter. While both meters beam in accordance to the beat, in compound meter that beat is a dotted note value. In 6/8 meter, (when performed ""in two"") the dotted quarter is the beat and the eighth note is the three part subdivision. A series of three eighth notes, all within a beat, will be beamed together.\nIt is important that the beamed group starts at the beginning of a dotted quarter pulse and concludes at the end of that same dotted quarter pulse.\nThe following example shows both a correct and incorrect beaming of rhythms in 9/8 (counted ""in three"").\nCommon rhythms in compound meter as shown below. Notice how the beaming of the sixteenth notes works within the eighth note beaming.\nOccasionally the beamed group of a rhythm will not begin or end on the dotted quarter pulse. The following example illustrates this notation, notice how the sixteenth notes in the first measure are beamed in two groups of two instead of grouping all four sixteenth notes together. This beaming allows the reader to see the second pulse of the measure as a new beamed group.\nThe beaming of triplets and other tuplets is in accordance with the borrowed subdivision. As an example, the following passage written in simple meter with triplet eighth notes is beamed similar to compound meter.\nEach assignment link below is to a GIF file on a single page.

23	I'm studying both electronics and food science - what specific technical challenges do flash memory and soft candy manufacturing face when it comes to managing their production processes?	Flash memory faces challenges in bit-level addressing and requires specific commands for locking, unlocking, programming, and erasing that vary by manufacturer. Similarly, in soft candy manufacturing, technical challenges include managing variable throughput due to different product attributes requiring different processing times, which can create bottlenecks. Both industries must carefully control their processes - flash memory for data integrity and candy manufacturing for consistent product quality.

A summary of these important forecast assumptions is included Exhibit 3. If the channel does not conduct at the intermediate voltage, it indicates that the FG is charged, and hence, a logical ""0"" is stored in the gate.\nBit-level addressing suits bit-serial applications such as hard disk emulationwhich access only one bit at a time. The specific commands used to lock, unlock, program, or erase NOR memories differ for each manufacturer.\nOther flash file systems, such as YAFFS2, never make use of this ""rewrite"" capability -- they do a lot of extra work to meet a ""write once rule"". On the other hand, applications that use flash as a replacement for disk drives do not require Flash memory inc write address, which would only add to the complexity and cost unnecessarily.\nFor portable consumer devices, these wearout management techniques typically extend the life of the flash memory beyond Flash memory inc life of the device itself, and some data loss may be acceptable in these applications.\nIf the channel conducts at this intermediate voltage, the FG must be uncharged if it was charged, we would not get conduction because the intermediate voltage is less than VT2and hence, a logical ""1"" is stored in the gate.\nThis means that now a higher voltage VT2 must be applied to the CG to make the channel conductive.

On a global scale, chocolate continues to dominate, and so sugar confectioners are fully aware there is opportunity for growth not only within their own niches, but by attracting more consumers whose desires for indulgence, convenience and exciting eating experiences are currently being met by chocolate makers.\nThe many faces of our industry\nWithin sugar confectionery too, the picture is mixed. While sugar chewing gum sales are dropping almost universally, sugar-free variants are enjoying continued success. And – contrary to the early expectations of some observers - hard candy is holding its own thanks to several factors, most particularly nostalgia, the drive for clean labels and expanding vegetarianism.\nEven a cursory look at the confectionery press in 2020 shows the ruckus of innovation and enthusiasm that surrounds soft products. With broad appeal and seemingly endless options for creativity, it is small wonder producers are investing their time and money here. As a result, competition has sharpened dramatically. Success doesn’t come easily, as consumer demands multiply, differentiation becomes tougher and rivals fight for share of wallet. There are, however, four key aspects of soft confectionery production that can have a demonstrative impact on manufacturers – both own-label and brands.\nCreativity and novelty never go out of fashion, and in confectionery, they are no longer a “nice-to-have’’ option but more a license to operate. But even with substantial imagination and an unprecedented array of available ingredients, bringing new products to market quickly is challenging, and there is always room for improvement.\nStarch moulding technology is proving a game-changer in the pursuit of constant “newness.” It enables manufacturers not only to create a huge variety of formats, sizes and shapes in gummies and jellies, it also permits the expansion of their portfolios to include products like liquorice, fondant cream and marshmallow foam. This opens up opportunities, particularly on the international stage, where consumer preferences vary among different confectionery types.\nThe depositing process delivers multiple opportunities to accommodate various product types and colours. Their pumps, which are available with a range of piston diameters and configurations, can handle different consistencies of syrup, and varying these pumps enables the production of single colour or side-by-side colours, as well as centre-fill, multi-layered and striped confections. As such, one soft confectionery line can become the source of dozens of product variants.\nResearch consistently shows that visual appeal is central to consumer purchasing decisions, and this is especially true in impulse buys like confectionery. And yet on occasion, insufficient attention is paid to the finishing touches to confectionery. It is true that we eat with our eyes, so improving appearance is sure to pay dividends, especially in today’s market where longer shelf life can adversely impact the product.\nTechnical advances in both ingredients and equipment mean producers now have more options than ever before when it comes to their product’s shape, colouring and finish. Even traditional sugar coating is advancing, thanks to the replacement of (potentially damaging) steam with tacking agents, applied precisely within specialised coating equipment. These assist with sugar powder or granule adhesion, which can now take place in a small tumble drum for more accurate application. But the combination of sugar with acids, notably citric and malic, presents even more exciting opportunities for flavour diversification beyond simply adjusting the amount and method of coating.\nOil coating is also undergoing transformation. Oil application with controlled spray action ensures reliable and repeatable coating, so maintaining overall quality while boosting appearance. Plus, in the healthy confectionery segment, new equipment makes it easier to control carefully the quantity, as well as the type of oil, for a better nutritional profile.\nIt is clear how the latest starch moulding and coating equipment can stimulate a huge proliferation in confectionery products – shapes and sizes, layers and flavours, coatings and polishes. But a hike in options commonly has an impact on throughput, as the varying attributes of each product may require each type to spend longer (or less time) in one process, resulting in bottlenecks or deceleration of the whole line.\nIt is not only variable end products that demand flexibility; rapidly changing market trends and seasonality necessitate frequent scaling up or down of production. Here too, starch moulding equipment has made meaningful strides. Modern machines, for instance, stack their own trays, in some cases using robotic technology, which has put an end to slow stacking, manually or with hand jacks.\nSimilarly, full integration of the feeder, starch buck, depositor, stacker and pallet transport efficiently and seamlessly moves product through the mogul line. Demoulding speeds can also be raised with the incorporation of rotary dumping stations. With throughput so high in one area of the line, it is important to ensure both up and downstream equipment can perform at the same level. For this reason, demand is rising for continuous on-machine finishing systems, which synchronise perfectly with modern moguls.\nClosely linked with throughput is productivity – ensuring the line is running as efficiently as possible for as long as possible, even when changeovers are frequent. The factors that can have a huge bearing on this are hygiene, maintenance and safety. And here too, confectioners can benefit from solutions that minimise downtime.\nHygienic design not only reduces the need to stop production for cleaning, but also optimises food safety and quality. Food grade stainless steel construction with easy access combines smooth, defect-free surfaces (to prevent residue build-up) with quicker and simpler cleaning. Stainless steel also holds advantages in the cleaning of depositors – a process especially important at the times of recipe or product change. They enable the pumping of hot water into depositing pumps, which are then activated to clean the pistons and all internal channels, without the removal of components. Residue simply dissolves in the hot water, saving manual effort, time and the use of chemicals.\nSimilarly, ensuring equipment is intrinsically safe can also maintain optimum productivity. In soft confectionery, one of the biggest risks to operator and plant safety is the handling of dry, uncontained starch. Checking that equipment complies with the legislation applicable in the country / region of its operation, for instance IECEx and ATEX in Europe or HAZLOC in North America, gives assurance that stringent safety requirements are being met and productivity can be maximised.\nToday’s soft confectionery market undoubtedly presents many opportunities for growth – but competition now is stiffer than ever before, and rapidly-evolving consumer demands mean there is no room for complacency, guesswork or mistakes. Just as critical to success as flavour and format are product characteristics and manufacturing parameters that can be significantly enhanced with the right choice of equipment. Decisions relating to this can offer a valuable boost to those looking to maximise their chances of long-term success.\n Mordor Intelligence: Candy Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2020 - 2025) https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/candy-market']"	['<urn:uuid:9853be3d-f40b-4e0e-9311-01dcc6314dae>', '<urn:uuid:f3dc7053-1ade-45b4-9417-17b7de1f300b>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	28	65	2018
24	risk age herniated disc treatment options	People between 35-55 years who are physically active have the highest risk of developing a herniated disc. While rest and medication are often sufficient treatments, non-surgical options like physical therapy and bracing should be tried for 6 weeks to 6 months before considering surgery. In rare cases where conservative treatments fail and the exact source of pain can be determined, surgical options including minimally invasive procedures may be recommended.

It consists of 33 small bones called vertebrae which articulate with each other. Each vertebra is separated by a shock-absorbing cushion called intervertebral disc. These discs are composed of two parts: an outer fibrous ring and a jelly-like centre. They are designed to absorb shocks and pressure and to keep the spine flexible. The discs nest perfectly between the vertebrae.||\n|Occasionally, increased intervertebral pressure or repetitive lumbar movement can weaken a disc. When this occurs, the outer fibrous ring ruptures and the centre, which is softer, bulges through the outer lining. This is known as a herniated disc. The herniation itself does not necessarily cause any problems. In fact, if part of the disc bulges forwards (towards the stomack), there are no symptoms and the situation resolves itself. However, if part of the disc bulges towards the back, the tissue can compress nerves, causing pain along the entire length of the nerve. Herniations most often occur in the lumbar or lower back area and can cause pain to radiate into the legs.|\n|Top view of the vertebral column|\nPhysically active people between the ages of 35 and 55 years have the greatest risk of developing a herniated disc. In fact, with age, the intervertebral discs become less flexible. As a result, the spine loses flexibility and tone, making it more difficult to perform physical activities. An awkward movement or excessive strain when lifting an object can also cause a herniation. Being overweight, pregnant or having bad posture can increase pressure on the back and predispose individuals to herniated discs.\nThe symptoms associated with herniated discs depend on the location and pressure exerted on the nerves. A herniation can cause pain, muscle weakness, tingling and stiffness. Depending on where the herniation is located, pain can radiate throughout the legs or abdomen (stomach). In rare cases, herniations can develop in the neck area. In such cases, pain can spread through the shoulders to the chest and arms. Pain may be exacerbated if the back muscles are solicited.\nHerniated discs are diagnosed by a physician. The physician will go over the patient's symptoms and conduct a physical examination. However, to examine the spine and make sure there are no underlying problems, various tests may be ordered. Diagnostic tests may include a scintiscan, computerized axial tomography (CAT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These medical imaging tests provide two or three dimensional images of the spine and surrounding tissues.\nRest is often the only treatment for a herniated disc. Medication may also be taken to relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Manipulation of the vertebrae, aimed at reducing pressure on an intervertebral disc, can be performed for certain types of herniations. In rare cases, surgery may be recommended.\nHere are a few measures that could help prevent a herniated disc:\n© Copyright Vigilance Santé\nThe patient information leaflets are provided by Vigilance Santé Inc.

Always consult a health care professional before making a decision about your medication or treatment."", 'If you’ve struggled with back pain for any length of time, you may be wondering if spine surgery is your only treatment option. Sometimes, surgery is the only treatment. However, there’s good news. The vast majority of back problems can be remedied with non-surgical treatments—often referred to as non-surgical or conservative therapies.\nAging, improper body mechanics, trauma and structural abnormalities can injure your spine, leading to back pain and other symptoms such as leg pain and/or numbness or even leg weakness. Chronic back pain is a condition that generally requires a team of health professionals to diagnose and treat. Before resigning yourself to surgery, consider getting opinions from several spine specialists. This investment of time and information-gathering will help you make an informed treatment decision that will best support your lifestyle and desired level of physical activity.\nWhat about conservative non-surigcal treatment?\nAs with all non-emergency spinal surgeries, a trial of non-operative treatment, such as physical therapy, pain medication—preferably an anti-inflammatory, or bracing should be observed before surgery is considered. The trial period of conservative treatment varies, but six weeks to six months is the general timeframe.\nSpine surgery may be recommended if non-surgical treatment such as medications and physical therapy fails to relieve symptoms. Surgery is only considered in cases where the exact source of pain can be determined—such as a herniated disc, scoliosis, or spinal stenosis.\nOpen surgery vs. minimally invasive spinal surgery\nTraditionally, spine surgery is usually performed as open surgery. This entails opening the operative site with a long incision so the surgeon can view and access the spinal anatomy. However, technology has advanced to the point where more spine conditions can be treated with minimally invasive techniques.\nBecause minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS), does not involve long incisions, open manipulation of the muscles and tissue surrounding the spine is avoided, therefore, leading to shorter operative time. In general, reducing intraoperative (during surgery) manipulation of soft tissues results in less postoperative pain and a faster recovery.\nImaging during spine surgery\nComputer-assisted image guidance allows surgeons to view the operative site in far finer clarity than traditional visualization techniques. In addition, implants such as rods or screws can be inserted and positioned with a greater degree of accuracy than is generally achieved with conventional techniques.\nIn computer-assisted image guidance, images taken preoperatively (before surgery) are merged with images obtained while the patient is in surgery, yielding real-time views of the anatomical position and orientation of the operative site while the patient is undergoing surgery. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) and intraoperative fluoroscopy (real-time x-ray) are generally used, as these enable surgeons to operate with a high level of precision and safety.\nNot all patients are appropriate candidates for MISS procedures. There needs to be relative certainty that the same or better results can be achieved through MISS techniques as with an open procedure.\nWhether open surgery or MISS, the spine can be accessed from different directions. These are referred to as surgical approaches and are explained below:\n- Anterior approach: As the name implies, the surgeon accesses the spine from the front of your body, through the abdomen.\n- Posterior approach: An incision is made in your back.\n- Lateral approach: The pathway to your spine is made through your side.\nCommon spine surgical procedures\nThere are a number of conditions that may lead to spine surgery. Common procedures include:\n- Discectomy or Microdiscectomy: Removal of a herniated intervertebral disc. Therefore, removing pressure from the compressed nerve. Microdiscectomy is a MISS procedure.\n- Laminectomy: Removal of the thin bony plate on the back of the vertebra called the laminae to increase space within the spinal canal and relieve pressure.\n- Laminotomy: Removal of a portion of the vertebral arch (lamina) that covers the spinal cord. A laminotomy removes less bone than a laminectomy.\nBoth laminectomy and laminotomy are decompression procedures. “Decompression” usually means tissue compressing a spinal nerve is removed.\n- Foraminotomy: Removal of bone or tissue at/in the passageway (called the neuroforamen) where nerve roots branch off the spinal cord and exit the spinal column.\n- Disc replacement: As an alternative to fusion, the injured disc is replaced with an artificial one.\n- Spinal fusion: A surgical technique used to join two vertebrae. Spinal fusion may include the use of bone graft with or without instrumentation (eg, rods, screws). There are different types of bone graft, such as your own bone (autograft) and donor bone (allograft). A fusion can be accomplished by different approaches:\nALIF, PLIF, TLIF, LIF: All pertain to lumbar interbody fusion used to stabilize the spinal vertebrae and eliminate movement between the bones.\n- Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion\n- Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion\n- Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion indicates a surgical approach through the foramen.\n- Lateral Interbody Fusion in which the minimally invasive approach is from the side of the body.\nExamples of spinal instrumentation include plates, bone screws, rods, and interbody devices; although, there are other types of devices your surgeon may recommend in treatment of your spinal disorder. The purpose of instrumentation is to stabilize or fix the spine in position until the fusion solidifies.\n- An interbody cage is a permanent prosthesis left in place to maintain the foraminal height (eg, space between two vertebral bodies) and decompression following surgery.\n- Interspinous process devices (ISP) reduce the load on the facet joints, restore foraminal height, and provide stability in order to improve the clinical outcome of surgery. An advantage of an ISP is that it requires less exposure to place within the spine and therefore is a MISS procedure.\n- Pedicle screws help to hold the vertebral body in place until the fusion is complete.\nSome patients are at-risk for their fusion not to heal properly or completely. Your surgeon may refer to this as a non-fusion, pseudarthrosis or a failed fusion. To help avoid fusion problems, your surgeon may recommend a bone growth stimulation. There are different types of stimulators; those implanted internally and others that are worn about the body area, such as the neck or low back.\nShould surgical treatment be your only recourse, it may help to understand that minimally invasive spine surgery offers many benefits. Patients who want to return to work and active play, as well as the elderly or those with major spinal problems, often achieve a higher level of function once symptoms are alleviated.']"	['<urn:uuid:3a28ef66-75fd-4554-a102-dd00df6f292f>', '<urn:uuid:cfc7e8a4-90d2-4423-8535-1f3dd1b1acc4>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	6	69	1627

The identification system consists of two parts: feature extraction part and classification part. The feature extraction part uses the method of approximate spectral density estimation of R-R-Intervals (RRI) data by implementing the soft decision sub-band decomposition technique. In the classification part, two different methods of machine learning…approaches with neural networks are implemented and compared in their performances. Those approaches are: supervised neural network (back-propagation) and unsupervised neural network (Kohonen self organizing maps). The data used in this work is obtained from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) databases. A data set of 17 CHF and 53 normal subjects is used as original training data set, while another set of 12 CHF and 12 normal subjects is used as original test data set. The classification features are the spectral density of 6 different regions covering the whole spectrum of the RRI data obtained by 32-bands soft decision algorithm. A larger training data set, which is obtained by simulating 1000 CHF and 1000 normal subjects according to the spectral features obtained from the original training data, is used to train the neural network. The neural network is used then to test another simulated data set of the same size of the training date set (simulated according to the spectral features obtained from the original test data set). The accuracy of the classification is found to be about 83.65% and 91.43% with supervised neural networks and unsupervised neural networks respectively.\nAbstract: This paper presents a new method of trajectory planning in rehabilitation robotics. First were measured in healthy subject the pick to place trajectories while haptic robot is in zero impedance space. B-spline approximation is used to mathematically define the measured paths. This trajectory path serves as a central line for the rounding haptic tunnel. In addition to radial elastic and damping force an optional guidance force can be applied along the tunnel to reach the place…point. The B-spline control points were observed around the robot and arm workspace. The trajectory path defined with B-splines is compared with minimum jerk and minimum torque defined trajectories. Finally are compared the pick to place movements with and without tunnel use in healthy subject and in stroke hemiplegic patient.\nAbstract: The main problems in intra-medullary nailing of femoral shaft-fractures are leg-length discrepancies and rotational differences with an incidence of 2–18% and 20–40% respectively. These may lead to severe postoperative sequelae such as additional correctional operations and difficult rehabilitation. Insufficient visualization can be considered the main reason for these complications. Finally, retention of the fragments in the correct alignment before nail insertion is difficult. To overcome these problems we established a…robotic telemanipulator system to support the reduction process. It was evaluated in 30 fractures of embalmed human femora. Specially programmed software used an image-dataset which was acquired by an isocentric 3D fluoroscope. For visualization, a surface projection was generated. Localization and tracking of the fragments and the robot-arm as well as accuracy measurement was performed by using an optical navigation system. Manipulation was controlled via a force-feedback joystick. This way, collisions of the fragments were transmitted back to the surgeon. At the end of the reduction the robot could rigidly retain the fragments\' position.\nAbstract: Purpose: Traditional surgical techniques for radiolunate arthrodesis typically result in an unsatisfactory primary stability. Thus cast immobilisation is implemented until bone healing is complete. Nonunion and implant dislocation are frequent complications. Methods: Eighteen patients (20 wrists) with rheumatoid disease who had undergone a radiolunate arthrodesis procedure using a mini-titanium-T-plate with an oblique screw were examined. The high primary stability of this fusion depends on three point fixation. Results:…Complete bone healing was achieved in all wrists. Dislocation of a screw occurred in one wrist which subsequently healed in mild dislocation. Grip strength improved in 12 hands with pain relief in 19 wrists. 18 patients rated the result of the operation as ""very good"" or ""good"" and would agree to have the operation again. Conclusion: The mini-titanium-T-plate with oblique screw achieves high primary stability via three point fixation of the lunate at the radius. Thus, postoperative immobilisation in a cast is unnecessary. The procedure is well tolerated by patients with a high satisfaction rating.', ""Managing Dementia Sleep ProblemsAlzheimer's, Dementia & Memory Care | April 26, 2016\nOur internal biological clocks begin to change as we grow older. Many seniors may have difficulty sleeping through the night, or find themselves napping more often throughout the day. However, these sleep problems are more pronounced in an elderly person with dementia. While sleep problems can occur at any stage of the disease, they seem to be more common in the later stages.\nDementia and Sleep Disturbances\nIt’s not entirely known why dementia causes such disruptions in sleep patterns. However, it’s thought that like the changes that occur with memory and behavior, sleeping habits also change due to the effect dementia has on the brain. Sundowner’s Syndrome is the term used to describe the confusion and agitation that can set in at dusk and continue throughout the evening hours for dementia sufferers. Some of the other changes and problems dementia can cause in sleep include:\n- Shifts in the sleep-wake cycle. Dementia sufferers may feel drowsy throughout the day and take frequent naps, which leads to being unable to fall asleep at night. Some may even experience a complete reversal in the sleep-wake cycle, feeling wakeful only throughout the nighttime hours. Studies have shown that those with dementia will spend about 40% of their time in bed at night wide awake and take naps throughout the day.\n- Trouble staying asleep. Once in bed, those with dementia may fall asleep but are unable to stay asleep. Or, they make wake up often and simply stay awake, unable to lie still and get the rest they need.\n- Nighttime wandering. When dementia sufferers wake in the night, it’s common for them to become confused, agitated, and unsure of what time it actually is. They may get up out of bed and leave their room, or even yell out and disrupt others around them.\nHelping Loved Ones with Dementia get a Good Night’s Sleep\nWhen you’re caring for a loved one with dementia, the disturbances in their nightly sleep patterns can take a toll on your health, too. However, it’s important for you to stay calm and remember that their behaviors aren’t deliberate. First and foremost, attend to their needs, remind them that it’s nighttime and try to guide your loved one back to bed.\nThere are a few other things you can do to try to lessen any dementia sleep problems that may be occurring, including:\n- Plan activities throughout the day. Keep your loved one as active as possible during the day; go on a walk, have them help with household tasks, and keep their minds busy, too. Avoid evening physical activities, however, as this could stimulate them near bedtime.\n- Provide a comfortable environment for sleeping. The room should be kept at a temperature that is neither too warm nor too cool, and the bed should be comfortable and supportive. Install a nightlight in the bedroom, too, in case they awaken in the middle of the night. Being in total darkness can cause confusion.\n- Seek sunlight in the morning. Being exposed to morning light, whether real or artificial, can help restore the circadian rhythm often disrupted by dementia and help reset internal clocks.\n- Avoid caffeine and alcohol. The caffeine in soda, coffee and tea can contribute to sleeplessness, so be sure to avoid any products with caffeine later in the day. As alcohol can enhance confusion, try to avoid any alcoholic beverages, too.\n- Limit noise and distractions in the evening. Provide a quiet environment towards the evening; discourage television watching and instead play soft music to get your loved one to relax.\n- Manage medications. Some medications can have an effect on sleeping patterns, so talk to the doctor and find out when is the best time to administer certain medications. Sleeping pills are generally discouraged for dementia sufferers, as these can increase confusion and the risk for falls.\nEstablish a nighttime routine that includes using the restroom, getting into comfortable bedclothes, turning on the nightlight, a favorite blanket, etc. This will help your loved one stay calm and relaxed as the evening approaches, allowing for the best night’s sleep possible.\nFor more information about American Senior Communities, please visit www.ASCSeniorCare.com.""]"	['<urn:uuid:bf19e8d2-376c-441d-8493-6ed41241cc98>', '<urn:uuid:ef5329f9-846b-405c-8421-1378303e7013>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	31	81	1840
26	sustainability costs desalination water reuse compare	Desalination and water reuse differ significantly in their sustainability and costs. Desalination is expensive, costing between $0.60-$0.80/m³, requires high energy consumption, and has environmental drawbacks including CO2 emissions and brine discharge that can harm marine life. Water reuse, while having an average cost of $1.79/m³, has lower marginal costs ($300-$1000 per acre-foot vs up to $2000 for desalination) and is more environmentally friendly as it conserves groundwater resources and requires less energy. Additionally, new nanotechnology developments like graphene oxide membranes could potentially reduce desalination energy costs by up to 90%, making it more viable in the future.	['26 Feb 2016\nSplitting water is a two-step process, and in a new study, researchers have performed one of these steps (reduction) with 100% efficiency. The results shatter the previous record of 60% for hydrogen production with visible light, and emphasize that future research should focus on the other step (oxidation) in order to realize practical overall water splitting. The main application of splitting water into its components of oxygen and hydrogen is that the hydrogen can then be used to deliver energy to fuel cells for powering vehicles and electronic devices.\nThe researchers, Philip Kalisman, Yifat Nakibli, and Lilac Amirav at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, Israel, have published a paper on the perfect efficiency for the water reduction half-reaction in a recent issue of Nano Letters.\n“I strongly believe that the search for clean and renewable energy sources is crucial,” Amirav toldPhys.org. “With the looming energy crisis on one hand, and environmental aspects, mainly global warming, on the other, I think this is our duty to try and amend the problem for the next generation.\n“Our work shows that it is possible to obtain a perfect 100% photon-to-hydrogen production efficiency, under visible light illumination, for the photocatalytic water splitting reduction half-reaction. These results shatter the previous benchmarks for all systems, and leave little to no room for improvement for this particular half-reaction. With a stable system and a turnover frequency of 360,000 moles of hydrogen per hour per mole of catalyst, the potential here is real.”\nWhen an H2O molecule splits apart, the three atoms don’t simply separate from each other. The full reaction requires two H2O molecules to begin with, and then proceeds by two separate half-reactions. In the oxidation half-reaction, four individual hydrogen atoms are produced along with an O2 molecule (which is discarded). In the reduction half-reaction, the four hydrogen atoms are paired up into two H2 molecules by adding electrons, which produces the useful form of hydrogen: H2 gas.\nIn the new study, the researchers showed that the reduction half-reaction can be achieved with perfect efficiency on specially designed 50-nm-long nanorods placed in a water-based solution under visible light illumination. The light supplies the energy required to drive the reaction forward, with the nanorods acting as photocatalysts by absorbing the photons and in turn releasing electrons needed for the reaction.\nThe 100% efficiency refers to the photon-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, and it means that virtually all of the photons that reach the photocatalyst generate an electron, and every two electrons produce one H2 molecule. At 100% yield, the half-reaction produces about 100 H2 molecules per second (or one every 10 milliseconds) on each nanorod, and a typical sample contains about 600 trillion nanorods.\nOne of the keys to achieving the perfect efficiency was identifying the bottleneck of the process, which was the need to quickly separate the electrons and holes (the vacant places in the semiconductor left after the electrons leave), and remove the holes from the photocatalyst. To improve the charge separation, the researchers redesigned the nanorods to have just one platinum catalyst instead of two. The researchers found that the efficiency increased from 58.5% with two platinum catalysts to 100% with only one.\nGoing forward, the researchers plan to further improve the system. The current demonstration requires a very high pH, but such strong basic conditions are not always ideal in practice. Another concern is that the cadmium sulfide (CdS) used in the nanorod becomes corroded under prolonged light exposure in pure water. The researchers are already addressing these challenges with the goal to realize practical solar-to-fuel technology in the future.\n“We hope to implement our design rules, experience and accumulated insights for the construction of a system capable of overall water splitting and genuine solar-to-fuel energy conversion,” Amirav said.\n“The photocatalytic hydrogen generation presented here is not yet genuine solar-to-fuel energy conversion, as hole scavengers are still required. CdS is unfortunately not suitable for overall water splitting since prolonged irradiation of its suspensions leads to photocorrosion. We have recently demonstrated some breakthrough on this direction as well. The addition of a second co-catalyst, such as IrO2 or Ru, which can scavenge the holes from the semiconductor and mediate their transfer to water, affords CdS-based structures the desired photochemical stability. I believe this is an important milestone.”\nMore information: Philip Kalisman, et al. “Perfect Photon-to-Hydrogen Conversion Efficiency.” Nano Letters. DOI: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b04813\nGenesis Nanotechnology, Inc. ~ “Great Things from Small Things”\n11 Jan 2016\nOne day soon, a start-up somewhere – possibly in Israel – will come up with a system to manufacture precisely-formed nanoparticles that, when joined with other particles, will change the way electronics, clothing, computers and almost everything else can be used.\nOne day, but not yet, according to Richard Robinson, a visiting scholar at Hebrew University’s Institute of Chemistry. Based at Cornell University, Robinson is in Israel to do research in the area of nanotechnology, where scientists manipulate very tiny atomic particles to create surprising and unique effects that are far different than anything observed in physics until now.\n“We know a lot about the principles of nanotechnology now, but there is still a lot to do at the research stage, which is one reason why nanotech hasn’t yet made its presence known to a large extent in the greater society,” Robinson told The Times of Israel . “Nevertheless nanotechnology is already having a major impact in certain applications, like lighting.”\nIn fact, one of the first commercially successful nano-based products to emerge came from the very Hebrew University lab where Robinson is doing research. Using unique quantum materials, Qlight developed semiconductor nanocrystals that can emit and provide extra brilliance to light, such as enhancing the color of display screens.\nLast year the company was acquired by Merck, the German chemical and technology company. Qlight’s technology, said Merck CEO Karl-Ludwig Kley, is “far superior to anything currently on the market, and that will help us retain and expand our position as market leader.”\nThere will likely be many more such announcements and pronouncements in the future, and many of them are set to be based on technology developed in Israel, said Robinson. “Israel is ahead of the curve on nanotechnology research,” said Robinson.\nAnd there’s plenty more research that needs to be done. “Over the past 20 years or so we have essentially been rewriting the textbooks on physics, because the laws that apply to ‘normal’ particles do not apply to nano-sized particles,” he added.\nIn other words, certain things happen when five nanometer-sized particles are combined with six nanometer-sized particles. “We’re still observing, categorizing and recording the reactions of these particles sizes with each other and others, in different kinds of materials, and their combinations,” said Robinson.\nAt home in Cornell, Robinson does a lot of work in materials, controlling their size, shape, composition and surfaces, and assembling the resulting building blocks into functional architectures. Among the applications Robinson’s lab is targeting are new materials for printable electronics and electrocatalysis. His group is also pioneering a new method to probe phonon transport in nanostructures.\nOn practical example of how nanotech will affect energy is to allow for a much more efficient production method for solar energy. In a solar energy system, the sun’s rays hit photovaltic cells that capture the energy and convert it into direct current (DC) electricity, which is then converted to alternating current (AC), for use in home electric systems or for transfer to the grid. But it turns out that the PV cells being used don’t capture as much of the sun’s rays as they can because of fluctuations in the wavelength of the rays due to time of day or time of year; only about 25% of the rays are captured on average.\nPV cells are designed to capture the sun at its strongest in midday, but they can’t capture rays at other times of the day. Using nanomaterials that respond to specific wavelengths PV technology can be much more efficient, tripling the usable “bounty” from the sun, said Robinson.\nEventually, said Robinson, nanotech will live up to the hype that has surrounded it for the past two decades.\n“The manufacturing process for nanoparticles is not yet precise. In order for nanotech to be fully commercialized, we need a way to produced nanoparticles on a mass basis with the right size needed for each application,” Robinson said. “We’re not there yet, but it’s on the way – and with all the nanotech research here in Israel, it may just be an Israeli start-up that develops it.”\nThis post is part of a series examining the connections between nanotechnology and the top 10 trends facing the world, as described in the Outlook on the Global Agenda 2015. All authors are members of the Global Agenda Council on Nanotechnology.\nIn the 2015 World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report survey participants ranked Water Crises as the biggest of all risks, higher than Weapons of Mass Destruction, Interstate Conflict and the Spread of Infectious Diseases (pandemics). Our dependence on the availability of fresh water is well documented, and the United Nations World Water Development Report 2015 highlights a 40% global shortfall between forecast water demand and available supply within the next fifteen years. Agriculture accounts for much of the demand, up to 90% in most of the world’s least-developed countries, and there is a clear relationship between water availability, health, food production and the potential for civil unrest or interstate conflict.\nThe looming crisis is not limited to water for drinking or agriculture. Heavy metals from urban pollution are finding their way into the aquatic ecosystem, as are drug residues and nitrates from fertilizer use that can result in massive algal blooms. To date, there has been little to stop this accretion of pollutants and in closed systems such as lakes these pollutants are being concentrated with unknown long term effects.\nWhile current solutions such as reverse osmosis exist, and are widely used in the water desalination of seawater, the water they produce is expensive. This is because high pressures are required to force the waster through a membrane and maintaining this pressure requires around 2kWh for every cubic meter of water. While this is less of an issue for countries with cheap energy, it puts the technology beyond the reach of most of the world’s population.\nAny new solution for water issues needs to be able to demonstrate precise control over pore sizes, be highly resistant to fouling and significantly reduce energy use, a mere 10% won’t make a difference. Nanotechnology has long been seen as a potential solution. Our ability to manipulate matter on the scale of a few atoms allows scientists to work at the same scale as mot of the materials that need to be removed from water — salts, metal ions, emulsified oil droplets or nitrates. In theory then it should be a simple matter of creating a structure with the correct size nanoscale pores and building a better filter.\nTen years ago, following discussions with former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, I organised a conference in Amsterdam called Nanowater to look at how nanotechnology could address global water issues. While the meeting raised many interesting points, and many companies proposed potential solutions, there was little subsequent progress.\nRather than a simple mix of one or two contaminants, most real world water can contain hundreds of different materials, and pollutants like heavy metals may be in the form of metal ions that can be removed, but are equally likely to be bound to other larger pieces of organic matter which cannot be simply filtered through nanopores. In fact the biggest obstacle to using nanotechnology in water treatment is the simple fact that small holes are easily blocked, and susceptibility to fouling means that\nFortunately some recent developments in the ‘wonder material’ graphene may change the economics of water. One of the major challenges in the commercialisation of graphene is the ability to create large areas of defect-free material that would be suitable for displays or electronics, and this is a major research topic in Europe where the European Commission is funding graphene research to the tune of a billion euros. Simultaneously there are vast efforts inside organisations such as Samsung and IBM. While defects are not wanted for electronic applications, recent research by Nobel Prize winner Andrei Geim and Rahul Nair has indicated that in graphene oxide they result in a barrier that is highly impermeable to everything except water vapour. However, precisely controlling the pore size can be difficult.\nAnother approach taken by researchers at MIT involves bombarding graphene sheets with beams of gallium ions to create weak spots and then etching them to create more precisely controlled pore sizes. A similar approach to water transport through defects has been taken by researchers at Penn State University.\nWhile all of the above show that graphene has prospects for use as a filter medium, what about the usual limiting issue, membrane fouling? Fortunately another property of graphene is that it can be hydrophilic, it repels water, and protein absorption has been reported to have been reduced by over 70% in bioreactor tests. Many other groups are working on the use of graphene oxide and graphene nanoplatelets as an anti-fouling coating.\nWhile the graphene applications discussed so far address one or two of the issues, it seems that thin films of graphene oxide may be able to provide the whole solution. Miao Yu and his team at the University of South Carolina have fabricated membranes that deliver very high flux and do not foul. Fabrication is handled by adding a thin layer of graphene to an existing membrane, as distinct from creating a membrane out of graphene, something which is far harder to do and almost impossible to scale up.\nGetting a high flux is crucial to desalination applications where up to 50% of water costs are caused by pressurising water for transmission through a membrane. Performance tests reveal around 100% membrane recovery simply by surface water flushing and pure water flux rates (the amount of water that the membrane transmits) are two orders of magnitude higher than conventional membranes. This is the result of the spacing between the graphene plates that allows the passage of water molecules via nanoscale capillary action but not contaminants.\nNon-fouling is crucial for all applications, and especially in oil/water separation as most of what is pumped out of oil wells is water mixed with a little oil.\nAccording to G2O Water, the UK company commercialising Yu’s technology, the increased flux rates are expected to translate directly into energy savings of up to 90% for seawater desalination. Energy savings on that scale have the potential to change the economics of desalination with smaller plants powered by renewable energy and addressing community needs replacing the power hungry desalination behemoths currently under construction such as the Carlsbad Project. This opens the possibility of low-cost water in areas of the world where desalination is currently too expensive or there is insufficient demand to justify large scale infrastructure.\nWhile more work is required to build a robust and cost-effective filtration system, the new ability to align sheets of graphene so that water but nothing else is transmitted may be the simple game-changer that allows the world to finally address the growing water crisis.\nAuthor: Tim Harper is Chief Executive Officer of G2O Water.\nImage: The colors of Fall can be seen reflected in a waterfall along the Blackberry River in Canaan, Connecticut REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi', 'Fresh water is an indispensable resource for human livelihood, agricultural irrigation and economic development (Brooks, 2007). However, due to the rapid population growth and the limited reserves, increasing regions have faced serious scarcity of fresh water (Williamson, 2010). Saudi Arabia is one of the driest countries in the world (CIA, 2011). According to World Bank (2011), the world average fresh water consumption is nearly 7000m³/year/person, while the water resource per capita in Saudi Arabia is less than 1200m³/year/person. In order to satisfy the demand for water, Saudi Arabia currently supplies fresh water via deep drilling of fossil groundwater (UNESCO, 2009).\nNevertheless, society increasingly recognises that those water resources are non-renewable and are liable to be reduced by the overexploited boreholes and wells. Thus Saudi Arabia needs to find alternative and sustainable methods to solve these issues. Since there is abundant sea water around Saudi Arabia, large-scale desalination could be the ideal solution to water scarcity. However, the expensive cost and the detrimental influence on the environment might limit the scale and sustainability of this method. Due to the cheap cost and the minor environmental damage, wastewater reuse is regarded as another potential solution. However, it seems to have a low social acceptance.\nTherefore, this report will compare the feasibility of desalination and water reuse in terms of cost, social acceptance and environmental impacts, thereby exploring the most suitable method to deal with the scarcity of water in Saudi Arabia.\nSaudi Arabia is located in the Middle East, bordering the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea (CIA, 2011). It is famous for the abundant reserves of oil and gas. However, the fresh water resources in Saudi Arabia are very limited. According to World Bank (2011), there is no one river and lake with perennial water throughout this country. Furthermore, due to the influence of the subtropical climate, the annual precipitation is only about 100 mm and the climate is hot and dry (ibid.). Additionally, rapid population growth has caused higher increase of demand for water (Abderrahman, 2000). Shortages of water have constrained the development of agriculture and economy (Williamson, 2010).\nSince the underground water is estimated to be able to supply for 320 years, the underground water is still the principal source of water at present (UNESCO, 2009: 100). However, with the increasing awareness of defects of this method, the focus of the future development of water provision has shifted to other sustainable water technologies. In order to deal with fresh water shortages, desalination has received enormous investments. According to Abu-Arabi (2007), in 2004 the number of desalination industries reached 30 and they can supply 1.1 billion cubic metres of fresh water per year.\nWastewater reuse is regarded as another future means of water provision. According to Bashitialshaaer et al (2009), in 2009 there were 33 wastewater treatment plants with a capacity of 748 billion cubic metres per year.\nCost should be the principal consideration of water provision because an expensive cost might limit the scale of application of methods. This also includes the cost of energy consumption.\nSocial acceptance plays a significant role in the development of water supply technologies. If the water cannot be accepted by society, it will lead to very little consumption.\nEnvironment has a profound influence on human beings. In order to prevent water supply technology undermining the environment, its impacts on the environment should be considered.\n4. Presentation of options\nDesalination is “a specific treatment process to take minerals from saline water to purify for drinking water and irrigation” (Al-Sahlawi, 1999). Sometimes this process is used to take salinity and other pollutants from wastewater. The general method of desalination is reverse osmosis or multi-stage flash distillation (Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club, 2008).\n4.2 Water Reuse\nWater reuse means treating wastewater to a specific quality, and then using treated or reclaimed water from one application for another application (McKenzie, 2005; Asano, 2006). The resources for wastewater reuse are various; according to Asano (2006), they could be domestic wastewater, industrial sewage, municipal sewage or agricultural wastewater.\n5. Comparison of Options\nAlthough the cost of desalination has decreased dramatically in the past three decades, it is still expensive to use in large scale. Alghariani (2003) points out that the expenditure of desalination consists of initial investment for equipment, running costs (including staff and maintenance), as well as chemicals or specialised parts. At present, according to the Third World Water Assessment Report (UNESCO, 2009: 155), the average cost of desalination is between $0.60/m³ and $0.80/m³. Moreover, Owens and Brunsdale (2000, cited in Alghariani, 2003: 5) claim that the cost of desalination in Florida can even be less than $0.55/m³, which is one-tenth of the cost price in 1979.\nHowever, as Wright (2009) points out, this cost is still higher than other water supply technologies. Apart from expenditure, desalination is generally considered a high-cost process due to the enormous energy consumption (Abu-Arabi, 2007). Nevertheless, this does not seem to be a problem for Saudi Arabia. According to the CIA (2010), the proven oil and gas reserves in Saudi Arabia are respectively the first and fifth in the world. As Abu-Arabi (2007) points out, in Saudi Arabia the annual solar energy received by each square kilometre of land is equivalent to 1.5 million barrels of crude oil. Abundant energy may lead to a low price.\nNevertheless, oil is non-renewable and oil reserves are estimated to last less than one century (World Energy Council, 2010), so the consumption of energy should be taken into account as a considerable cost. Moreover, the treatment of the waste gas generated by desalination also increases the cost (Al-Sahlawi, 1999).\nThe cost of water reuse is influenced by various factors such as treatment level, intended reuse options, location of treatment, wastewater collection and transportation. According to Qadir et al (2009), the average cost of recycling water is approximately $1.79 per cubic metre. However, compared to desalination, wastewater reuse has the advantage of cost. Fryer (2010) demonstrates that the relative marginal cost of seawater desalination is higher than water recycling, and amounts to up to $2000 per acre-foot. The water recycling represented a general fluctuation pattern between approximately $300 and $1000 per acre-foot (Fryer, 2010). Even so, water recycling appears cheaper than desalination.\n5.2 Social acceptance\nWhile both options can generate safe water, desalination seems to have higher social acceptance. Sloane (2009) investigated the acceptance of desalination and water reuse at Nourieh Palms. As shown in Table 2, in all areas but particularly drinking water, the approval rate for desalination is higher than water reuse. This reflects that more people trust the quality of water which is generated by desalination.\nSource: Sloane (2009: 128)\nFor most uses, reclaimed water tends to have lower social acceptance than desalination. There are various reasons why people do not trust reclaimed water. First, most people do not understand the difference between treated and untreated water (McKenzie, 2005). Secondly, they are often concerned about the type of wastewater, treatment levels and the availability of information (Qadir, 2009). There are particular concerns with the wastewater produced by the petroleum industry, brought to the surface when drilling oil.\nThis kind of wastewater is difficult to treat due to the high content of oil (Asatekin and Mayes, 2009). Therefore, though reclaimed water undergoes a very thorough treatment process which makes it entirely safe to drink, the public are reluctant to drink treated sewage. However, it is not impossible that people will accept drinking such treated sewage. For example, Singapore has successfully used reclaimed water, a product named NEWater, to supply drinking water (Tortajada, 2006). This reflects that treated wastewater could become widely accepted through public education.\n5.3 Influence on environment\nThere are some environmental disadvantages of desalination. Since Saudi Arabia is rich in oil and gas, clean energy such as solar energy tends to be used less than fossil energy (Al-Sahlawi, 1999). The overuse of fossil energy may cause serious environmental pollution. For instance, oil might generate large quantities of carbon dioxide, which is the main factor leading to global warming (Al-Aza, 2005). Furthermore, the gas emissions from oil could undermine the ozone layer and cause acid rain (ibid.). In addition to environmental pollution caused by fossil energy, brine discharge is another serious problem. After desalination, the brines generally have a higher concentration of salt, nearly twice that of natural seawater (Tsiourtis, 2002). The brines are generally discharged back to the same place where the seawater comes from. This might lead to increased concentration of salt in the sea, which is a potential threat to aquatics.\nIn contrast with the desalination, wastewater reuse is regarded as an eco-friendly way to supply fresh water. Recycling water can maximise the use of rainfall and other current water resources so that the limited underground water resources can be conserved (Miller, 2005). In the meantime, decreased energy consumption could reduce the pollution caused by the use of fossil energy (Ghermandi et al, 2007). Therefore, recycled water is a sustainable and eco-friendly method to supply good quality fresh water.\nFrom the information given above, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n1) Both desalination and wastewater reuse are feasible water supply technologies.\n2) The cost of desalination has decreased dramatically, but is still far more than water reuse. Desalination requires more capital and energy.\n3) Reclaimed water has low public acceptance, especially for drinking water.\n4) Desalination could undermine the environment, while water reuse is eco-friendly.\nConsidering the cost and the impact on the environment, wastewater reuse is recommended to be used as the main water supply technology. Although the public acceptance of recycled water is lower than desalination, the example of Singapore has proven that reclaimed water could be accepted in daily life. Desalination is a costly water supply technology. Furthermore, it needs a vast amount of energy. Even if Saudi Arabia has abundant oil and gas reserves, as these resources are non-renewable, desalination is not suitable for sustainable water supply. Additionally, it has detrimental influences upon the environment. Therefore, Saudi Arabia should improve the ratio of wastewater reuse in the whole fresh water supply system.\nAbderrahman, W. (2000).

27	planning ancient aegina sightseeing near harbour location old military port position still visible today	"The ancient military harbor, known as the ""hidden port,"" was located just north of the modern commercial harbor. Its ruins can still be seen underwater today, and the current beach of Aegina coincides with this ancient walled harbor where military vessels were once docked."	['Ancient Aegina was an affluent state with considerable power and influence over the entire Mediterranean from Neolithic times all the way through the Classical era. (see Aegina History)\nWhile the temple of Aphaia is the most popular destination of the island, the ancient ruins to the north of Aegina town, at Kolonna, are a testament to the long history of the island.\nThe excavations at Kolona present a complex layer of ruins crowned by the foundations and a lone standing column from the opisthodromos of the Temple of Apollo. While difficult to decipher in its present state, it is a Doric temple, built with 6 columns at the front and back, and 12 columns at the flanks (just like the nearby temple of\nAphaia). The Late Archaic temple was built of local poros stone between 520 and 500 BCE and it crowned the city’s acropolis.\nMany of the badly damaged fragments from the temple’s sculptural decorations are exhibited at the nearby museum of Aegina. The east pediment depicted a battle scene with Heracles and the Aeginetan hero Telamon against the Amazons.\nA great deal of the ruins date from the Helladic (Bronze Age) fortified settlement, intermingled with Archaic structures, and later Roman fortifications. Several Byzantine buildings are also visible; although it would be difficult for the untrained visitor to decipher what era each ruin belongs to, despite the several marble markers that appear near them.\nExcavations of the settlement from the Bronze Age (2500-1600 BCE) unearthed ten levels of occupation, with the fortifications of the fifth level (2200-2050 BCE) being the most impressive with tall walls. This settlement shows evidence of destruction by fire and the next city layer was protected with thicker walls and entrances that were protected by round towers.\nOther ruins of note are the badly damaged Tomb of Phokos, the shrine of Ajax (Aiakeion), and a small temple of Artemis.\nThe ruins are located right next to the sea and most of the unearthed settlements were protected by an encircling wall. Ancient Aegina had two harbors. The commercial harbor was located exactly where the modern harbor is today, and just to the north of it the ruins of the “hidden port” or the harbor where the military vessels were docked can be seen under the surface of the sea. Today’s beach of Aegina coincides with the ancient “hidden port”, and many bathers frolic in the shallow waters unaware that they swim within the confines of the ancient walled harbor.\nThe Archaeological Museum of Aegina is located in the same area as the archaeological site of Kolonna, and it houses numerous artifacts from the island. Unfortunately, the sculptures of the temple of Aphaia pediment are not among them. Fragmented sculptures from the temple of Apollo pediment are located in room 8 of the museum.\nThe museum is divided into eight rooms and each room exhibits artifacts from the different historical eras of Aegina. There are several interesting reconstructions of the Bronze Age city at Kolonna, and a multitude of pottery from the Mycenaean era.\nThe unique highlights of the museum are the large Bronze age storage jars (1900-1800 BCE) in room 3, the Sphinx from the temple of Aphaia in room 5, and the fragmented sculpture from the temple of Apollo. In room 6 there is a delightful jar, with a depiction of Odysseas escaping the cave of the Cyclops under a large ram.\nWhile the artifacts housed in the museum are definitely worth a visit if you are in the area, the building itself is in bad need of repair and renovations.\nThe museum is open from 8:30-15:00 daily (closed on Mondays), and the 3 Euro entrance fee allows admittance to the museum and the Archaeological site of Kolonna. Both can be easily visited in one-hour long leisurely walk. The museum is located ten minutes north from the ferry quay. When you disembark walk to the left.']	['<urn:uuid:b374def9-fad7-49db-8f90-9d54bf52fd4a>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	14	44	651
28	Working in maternal healthcare, I need data on how mobile technology is being used to reduce maternal mortality in Kenya. What specific solutions are being implemented to help pregnant women?	A mobile-based service called mHMtaani (mobile health for our communities), based on m-health platform CommCare, helps community health workers monitor pregnant women's progress. It enables them to remind mothers-to-be of their delivery dates, improving the likelihood they will reach the hospital in time for birth. This is crucial in Kenya where more than five women in every 1,000 die in childbirth.	['In recent years, technical innovations have been bringing about some really positive changes in Kenya’s healthcare sector. While many of these developments are primarily aimed at improving access to healthcare for the urban poor and people living in remote rural areas, some have real potential to reduce the health insurance premiums that companies pay to protect their employees.\nHere we’ll take a look at some of the inspirational technology that is already changing lives in Kenya, the trends shaping the direction of this exciting field, and ways your company could benefit.\nReaching further with m-health\nAccording to the latest figures from the Communications Authority, around 90% of Kenyans now have a mobile phone. The rapid adoption of mobile telephony has fuelled a surge of mobile phone-based healthcare, or m-health solutions.\nHealth-focused smartphone apps are bringing a wide range of benefits to people across Kenya.\nHealth-focused smartphone apps are bringing a wide range of benefits to people across Kenya. These include improved access to diagnosis of conditions such as malaria, cervical cancer, diabetes and hypertension. They are also providing health practitioners with an overview of the HIV and AIDS situation across the country, making it easier to allocate resources. In addition, people now have instant access to health information and details of local medical service providers. And currently in development, there is assistance for girls affected by female genital mutilation (FGM), spearheaded by a group of students from Kisumu Girls’ High School.\nElsewhere, another mobile-based service, mHMtaani (mobile health for our communities), based on m-health platform CommCare, helps community health workers monitor the progress of pregnant women. Crucially it enables them to remind mothers-to-be of their delivery date, improving the likelihood that they will get to hospital in time for the birth. This could make a major difference in a country where more than five women in every 1,000 still die in childbirth. mHMtaani also helps health workers track the wellbeing of orphans and vulnerable children.\nThere has also been great success with more basic mobile-enabled solutions. For example, studies have shown that receiving regular text message reminders significantly improved Kenyan HIV patients’ adherence to their antiretroviral medication, resulting in better rates of viral suppression. In Kenya in particular, a lot of the m-health developments so far have been in the area of HIV management. It’s likely, however, that we will see a shift towards tackling non-communicable diseases.\nTelemedicine – access to expertise from anywhere\nComputer-based telemedicine is helping to pick up and manage serious conditions among people in rural areas of Kenya. For example, in 2015, pharmaceutical giant Merck partnered with the Ministry of Health to launch an online cancer diagnosis and consultation service. Patients in remote parts of the country can now have virtual appointments with cancer specialists at Kenyatta National Hospital and Machakos Hospital via a video link to their local clinic.\nAimed at a more privileged demographic, there are now virtual doctor services available that enable people to have a video consultation on their phone for less than the cost of an appointment at a private hospital.\nTracking individual fitness\nGlobally, wearable health devices are a huge growth area. People keen to improve their levels of fitness have enthusiastically embraced activity tracking devices such as Fitbits and Jawbones. While the fitness tracker trend hasn’t yet had much impact in Kenya due to the cost of the devices, a recent article published in Scientific Research suggested that wearable health sensors could be used to improve health in areas of extreme poverty.\nEasier ways to pay for healthcare\nMobile money transfer system M-Pesa has made accessing funds and paying for treatment easier. In 2015 Safaricom launched a health payment service called M-Tiba, in conjunction with PharmAccess Foundation and CarePay. This adds secure dedicated ‘health wallets’ to M-Pesa, where people can keep money aside for their own and their dependants’ health needs. Donor organisations, which are responsible for around 30% of all health payments in Kenya, can also use the service and track how beneficiaries use the funds donated.\nTechnology in operation\nOther areas of technology are showing great potential to improve the operational side of healthcare provision in Kenya. For example, Kenyan hospitals, such as the International Center for Minimal Access Surgery (ICMAS), are now beginning to offer robotically assisted surgery, sometimes with the aid of 3D imaging. This makes operations less invasive, helping to improve patient outcomes and recovery times.\nKenyan hospitals, such as the International Center for Minimal Access Surgery (ICMAS), are now beginning to offer robotically assisted surgery, sometimes with the aid of 3D imaging.\nImproving clerical efficiency and learning\nMost health records in Kenya are still kept locally in paper form, so this could make a huge difference to the overall efficiency of the country’s health services. At the moment, many care providers routinely create new paper files for patients they haven’t seen recently, rather than going to the trouble of retrieving their existing ones. This exposes them and the patient to a whole range of risks.\nNairobi software company Savannah Informatics has developed a tool that is making it possible for digital patient records to be shared between health facilities. And the digitisation of patient records has already begun. The virtual doctor service, AfriDOKTA, is offering patients the option of having all their paper-based medical records converted to electronic versions. If cloud and open-source technology make the conversion to fully digital patient records more financially viable, this would drive efficiency as well as supporting services like telemedicine, making high quality care more accessible for all.\nDigitised records will also facilitate big data analysis and machine learning, to pick up important health trends, support diagnosis and care and even help to prevent diseases from developing. The ability for different organisations to share anonymised health data, even internationally, then apply artificial intelligence to analysing it could have a huge impact on our understanding and prevention of key health concerns.\nMany local providers have now switched to smart cards for their members when accessing treatment at the various provider centres.\nHow healthcare tech can help your business\nAs these and other technological innovations are adopted by Kenyan healthcare services, the improvements they yield will present various opportunities for businesses to cut the cost of their health insurance. Here are three prominent ways in which new tech can help you to streamline your employee healthcare programme.\nSave time with telemedicine – it’s now possible for your employees to have a medical consultation for a non-emergency health concern without leaving the workplace, via a smartphone, tablet or computer. As well as saving on direct health costs, this could help to reduce absenteeism and maximise productivity. Telemedicine provider AfriDOKTA allows companies in Kenya to sign up for an account for minimal upfront fees. Its systems even integrate with insurers’ databases to verify insurance benefit coverage before providing a service.\nIt’s now possible for your employees to have a medical consultation for a non-emergency health concern without leaving the workplace, via a smartphone, tablet or computer.\nEradicate inefficiency with digitised data – digitised systems are gradually helping Kenyan health providers improve efficiency in all areas, from patient care to drugs management. This will help to keep their costs under control, which should see billable amounts beginning to drop. Using healthcare providers that have switched to digital record keeping could safeguard your employees’ welfare, helping to ensure they receive the right care, taking into account their medical history, leading to further cost savings. And the intelligence gleaned from the aggregated analysis of digital health data will help businesses to educate employees in disease prevention, thus reducing the need for medical care.\nKeep track with wearables – wearable health tracking technology offers huge potential to improve health services and reduce costs. A fascinating study by healthcare analytics company Springbuk Inc found that employees at a healthcare company who wore a fitness monitoring device as part of a wellness programme accrued lower healthcare costs than their colleagues. The improvement was most marked for individuals who were assessed as less active at the start of the programme: their total health costs went down by an average of 59%.\nBuild new tech into your staff welfare strategy\nWhile there is always an initial investment required, digital technology can bring about significant improvements in the quality of healthcare your workers receive and, through their efficiency, help to slash costs in the long term. Next time you speak to your insurance advisor, ask them what they can recommend to help you harness these developments within your company and start realising the benefits of high-tech healthcare.']	['<urn:uuid:85a2f029-f9db-48bf-ac28-a57726b144a8>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	30	61	1427
29	compare complications risk between chest tube placement for pleural effusion and arthroscopic medial reefing for patellar instability	Chest tube placement for pleural effusion has rare complications including bleeding, infection, and lung puncture, with the main issue being discomfort until removal. In contrast, arthroscopic medial reefing for patellar instability has shown significantly higher complication rates, with studies showing residual complaints in 79% of cases and recurrent dislocations in many patients, reaching 52% after 10 years post-surgery.	"['Treatment for Pleural Effusion\nTreatment of pleural effusion depends on the underlying cause. For example, treatment directed at congestive heart failure reduces the pleural fluid most of the time. Removal of the offending drug often resolves drug-induced pleural effusion. Two conditions that require special consideration include empyema and malignant effusion.\nBacterial pneumonia can cause pleural effusion that is not infected, called a parapneumonic effusion. When the fluid is infected or quite inflamed it is called a complicated parapneumonic effusion, or an empyema. Infection in the pleural space causes severe inflammation, which causes adhesions to form and ""scarring down"" of the pleural space. This, in turn, can compress the lung until the infection clears.\nThe infection is very difficult to eradicate without draining the fluid. If a thoracentesis is performed for an empyema, the fluid rapidly reaccumulates. Therefore, therapy is directed at draining the pleural space completely and keeping it empty until the infection has cleared.\nThe most common method for treating an empyema is drainage with a chest tube. Antibiotics are required regardless of the method of drainage. The chest tube is inserted into the pleural space between the ribs on the patient\'s side.\nThe patient is usually given light sedation or analgesic intravenously. The patient\'s skin is then prepped with iodine containing a preparation that decreases the bacteria on the skin and limits the risk for infection. The skin and underlying tissue to the pleural membrane is anesthetized using a small needle, very similar to thoracentesis.\nAn incision is made into the skin, and the underlying tissue is separated (dissection) until the pleural space is entered. Some physicians use a trocar instead of dissection to place a chest tube. A tube, usually about as big around as a small finger is inserted in the pleural space. This tube is sutured into place and the skin around the tube is sutured. This tube is often hooked up to a suction device to facilitate drainage. The chest tube is left in place for several days until the fluid stops forming and drainage is minimal.\nComplications are rare and include bleeding, infection, and a puncture in the lung. Chest tube placement is somewhat uncomfortable and the site where the tube is placed remains uncomfortable until the tube is removed. Usually patients with a chest tube require systemic analgesics, either pills or injections, until the tube is removed.\nIt may not be possible to drain all the fluid because of formation of fibrin septa, or partitions. Fibrin is a molecule that is a key component in the formation of blood clots. In an empyema, there is a lot of fibrin that can create pockets of fluid (loculated effusion) that cannot reach the drainage site.\nThere are two ways to deal with a loculated effusion: chemically and surgically. A chemical that breaks up fibrin, such as urokinase and streptokinase, can be instilled through a chest tube daily for several days. The chemical may succeed in breaking up the fibrin adhesions, allowing the fluid to drain.\nDecortication is a surgical procedure performed under general anesthesia in which the surgeon manually breaks up the adhesions and drains the pleural space. The surgeon puts a chest tube into place so the pleural space continues to drain (postsurgically) until fluid ceases to be produced and drainage resolves, typically a few days.\nMalignant Pleural Effusions\nMalignant pleural effusions are generally treated to relieve shortness of breath and/or chest pain caused by the presence of mesothelioma (caused by asbestosis) or neoplasms that have metastasized from elsewhere in the body; the lungs or breast are usually the primary site.\nMetastatic involvement is far more frequent than primary malignancies of the pleura (mesotheliomas). There are four ways to treat a malignant pleural effusion and the choice depends on the individual case.\nThe first method is chemotherapy. If the tumor(s) responds to this therapy, the pleural effusion may resolve. The second method is intermittent thoracentesis. If the fluid re-accumulates very slowly (over several months) pleural effusion is drained intermittently by thoracentesis, as needed. The third method is pleurodesis, which is done if the pleural effusion re-accumulates rapidly after drainage. The fourth method is the use of a pleural-peritoneal shunt.\nPleurodesis is often performed to control malignant pleural effusion and is occasionally used to control nonmalignant pleural effusion. Pleurodesis employs a sclerosing agent that causes inflammation and scarring on the pleural surfaces so the parietal and visceral pleura adhere. This closes the space, so fluid cannot accumulate.\nThere are two methods. In one, a chest tube is used to drain fluid. Once the fluid is drained, the sclerosing agent is injected through the chest tube into the pleural space. The sclerosing agent is allowed to distribute itself over a couple of hours and then the chest tube is attached to a suction device. Suction brings the two pleural surfaces together and allows them to ""scar"" together.\nIt takes a few days for the fluid to drain sufficiently before the sclerosing agent can be injected. The chest tube stays in place, typically for a few days, until drainage decreases to a reasonable level. Unfortunately, this can take several days to accomplish. As mentioned above, the chest tube is usually uncomfortable and the patient usually needs analgesics.\nThe second method uses thoracoscopy. A small incision or incisions are made in the skin and a small thoracoscope is passed through the incision to visualize the pleura. The sclerosing agent is placed under direct visualization onto the pleural surface.\nComplications with this procedure include a small risk for bleeding and infection. Pneumothorax is uniformly present and requires a chest tube for a short time after the procedure. Proponents of this procedure believe the sclerosing agent can be more efficiently applied to the pleura. However, there are no studies showing one method to be superior to the other. Several agents can be used for pleurodesis, including talc, bleomycin, and doxycycline.\nUnfortunately, not every patient with a symptomatic pleural effusion is a candidate for a pleurodesis and the procedure does not work in every case. Patients with a life expectancy of less than a few months generally are not candidates. Patients with a very low functional status and patients with a trapped lung also are not candidates.\nA trapped lung does not expand and fill up the chest after drainage of the fluid. This can happen when the visceral pleura has become so encased with tumor or scarring that it prevents the lung from expanding. Lungs may not re-expand when a tumor blocks the bronchial tubes and air cannot pass into that area of the lung. If the lung does not re-expand, pleurodesis simply cannot work. Patients with very low fluid pH also are not candidates for pleurodesis.\nPleural abrasion with or without pleurectomy\nPatients who have failed pluerodesis and are surgical candidates may be considered for pleural abrasion with or without pleurectomy. In this procedure, the surgeon mechanically roughens the surfaces of the pleural membranes, causing inflammation and injury that leads to scarring and adhesion of the opposing sides. The pleural membranes can also be removed during this procedure. This procedure is done infrequently.\nA pleural-peritoneal shunt may be considered for selected patients. One end of a catheter is placed in the pleural space, the catheter is tunneled under the skin, and the other end is placed in the abdominal cavity (peritoneal cavity). The catheter has a one-way valve and an area that can be compressed to pump fluid from the pleural space into the peritoneal space.\nThe main drawback in this procedure is that the catheter can clog. The fluid, rich in malignant cells, is pumped into the peritoneal cavity, where tumor involvement can occur. This procedure can be effective for relieving symptoms.', 'Surgery and non-surgical treatments for acute and chronic knee cap dislocation\nDanielle R. Steilen-Matias, MMS, PA-C\nIn this article, we will examine surgical and non-surgical options for the patient with recurrent patellar instability or kneecap dislocation.\nKneecap dislocation occurs when there is an impact injury to the knee significant enough to dislodge the kneecap. When this injury occurs there can be damage or complete disintegration of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) and medial patellotibial ligament (MPTL). When there is the complete destruction of the ligament(s), the patient will then decide if they will have a medial patellofemoral ligament and/or medial patellofemoral ligament and medial patellotibial ligament reconstruction surgery.\nWhat we will discuss in this article the various options for treatment:\n- Surgery for a completely disintegrated ligament that occurs with acute injury and dislocation\n- No surgery for a completely disintegrated ligament\n- Surgery for a medial patellofemoral ligament and medial patellotibial ligament partial tear or wear and tear damage\n- Regenerative medicine injections for medial patellofemoral ligament and medial patellotibial ligament partial tear or wear and tear damage\nAcute patella dislocation surgery\nSurgery for a completely disintegrated ligament that occurs with acute injury and dislocation.\nWhat we are going to look at first is the injury that occurs when the knee suffers a blow that knocks the kneecap out of its groove. When this injury occurs almost always the medial patellofemoral ligament is completely ruptured.\nLigaments connect bones to bones. The medial patellofemoral ligament connects the lower thigh bone to the back of the patella/kneecap. So it is easy to see when the kneecap is dislocated, this attachment snaps.\n- At this point, a decision must be made on treatment. First, we will look at the surgical treatment.\nThe first treatment decision is obviously to get the kneecap back in place and secure it.\n- Your doctor may recommend surgery to repair or reconstruct the medial patellofemoral ligament. He/she will refer to it as your MPFL.\nIf this is your first kneecap dislocation, the decision to go to surgery will come with a degree of urgency. Surgeons believe that they only get one chance to perform a repair to your original ligament. After repeated dislocations, the original ligament cannot be surgically repaired, It must be reconstructed from a tendon or ligament that the surgeons get from somewhere else in your body.\n- The points to consider here and that will be documented in research below:\n- The ligament can only be repaired in a partial tear or rupture situation\n- If the ligament suffers a total rupture/disintegration – then the surgery is not repair, but reconstruction.\n- These surgeries have been shown that they do not decrease future dislocation risk. (This is something we will discuss below, isolated repair cannot guarantee future knee stability).\nIn this October 2018 research, we see surgeons talking to surgeons in the medical journal Arthroscopy. (1) Let’s join the conversation:\nThe purpose of this research is to “clarify the discrepancy in surgical options and present evidence to treat patellar dislocation by evaluating which of the (surgical) techniques yields better improvement in stability and functional recovery for patellar dislocation.”\nIn this research, military and university researchers in South Korea shared with the international surgical community these findings:\n- Eleven clinical studies were investigated to determine the effective outcome of surgical versus non-surgical treatment\n- In patients with acute patellar dislocation, there were no significant differences in all evaluated outcomes between the conservative and surgical treatment groups.\n- For patients with recurrent patellar dislocation, MPFL reconstruction was associated with better outcome scores than compared with soft tissue realignment surgery.\nSurgical treatment of the MPFL for acute patellar dislocation is not superior to conservative non-surgical treatment in restoring knee function and clinical outcomes\n- Surgical treatment of the MPFL for acute patellar dislocation is not superior to conservative non-surgical treatment in restoring knee function and clinical outcomes\n- MPFL reconstruction is associated with more favorable clinical outcomes compared with medial soft tissue realignment surgery in patients with recurrent patellar dislocation.\n- MPFL reconstruction is the better of surgical treatment strategies, once the patient decides that they want the surgery anyway.\nThe bottom line: Surgeons are reporting to surgeons that non-surgical technique is in fact just as good as surgery.\nAcute Patella dislocation | Traditional non-surgical conservative care | Immobilization and rehab\nNow we are going to get into even more controversy surrounding the treatment of a patella dislocation. The conservative non-surgical treatment option. This is not to be confused with the non-surgical regenerative medicine option we will discuss below.\nA well-cited paper from the Department of Orthopaedics, Southern California Permanente Medical Group was published in the journal Sports Health. What the doctors were looking for was to provide guidelines, A Treatment Algorithm for Primary Patellar Dislocations, (2) which was the title of their paper. Here is what they said:\n“Surprisingly little evidence exists addressing the nonoperative treatment of the primary patellar dislocation. Contemporary treatment regimens range from immediate mobilization without a brace to cast immobilization in extension for 6 weeks.”\nHere are some of the issues they came across:\n- Immobilization in extension (your knee is fixed in a straight leg position) may give the MPFL better environment in which to heal. However, this comes at the expense of stiffness, weakness, and loss of limb and proximal control that often accompany prolonged immobilization.\n- Patient compliance can also be a factor in deciding nonoperative treatment. For these reasons, many clinicians advocate a short period of immobilization, followed by rehabilitation of the knee, with or without a patellar brace.\n- Although the management of the primary patellar dislocation remains a topic of considerable controversy, certain conclusions can be drawn. If a hemarthrosis (bleeding in the knee) is present, patients should be evaluated for osteochondral fractures (damaged to the cartilage and bone underneath).\n- Acute surgical stabilization remains controversial, with no clear long-term benefits demonstrated in the literature.\n- If nonoperative management is elected, a period of immobilization in extension up to 6 weeks will yield the lowest redislocation rate.\n- In sum, this algorithm provides an evidence-based approach that assists the clinician in the treatment of the acute first-time patellar dislocation.\nIt is clear from these two representative studies why acute patella dislocation usually becomes a situation of chronic patella dislocation\nSurgery for chronic patella dislocation – does this surgery help a 16 year old athlete? Surgery judged ineffective\nDoctors in Germany at Münster University Hospital wrote in the journal BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders June 24, 2017 that:\n- There is currently no consensus regarding the optimal surgical treatment method for patients with recurrent patellar instability. (Chronic patella dislocation).\nThe goal then of their study was to evaluate the long-term results of combined arthroscopic medial reefing (reconstructive surgery of the supporting connective tissue of the patella) and lateral release (surgery to put the patella back into its correct position.)\nThe average age of the patients at the time of surgery was 16 and comprised of adolescent athletes. The youngest patient in the study was 9. The patients were followed for about 5 – 15 years post surgery.\n- Pain continued post surgery: Residual complaints were present in 34 cases (79%).\n- Dislocation continued post surgery: Twenty-two cases had recurrent dislocation after a median interval of 30 months. The probability of recurrent dislocations amounted to 16% after 1 year and 52% after 10 years.\n- Surgery judged ineffective: The combined arthroscopic lateral release with medial reefing does not appear to be an adequate treatment for patients with chronic patellar instability in long-term follow-up.\n- Younger patients might be at a higher risk for recurrent dislocations.(3)\nWhy Do Patellofemoral Stabilization Procedures Fail?\nDoctors in the United Kingdom said it more simply in their March 2017 paper published in the Sports medicine and arthroscopy review. They asked Why do patellofemoral stabilization procedures fail?\nIn recent years, surgical interventions for patellofemoral joint instability have gained popularity, possibly revitalized by the recent advances in our understanding of patellofemoral joint instability and the introduction of a number of new surgical procedures. This rise in surgical intervention has brought about various complications.(4)\nPatellofemoral instability surgery success rates?\n- Doctors note that many treatments can make symptoms of patellofemoral instability and pain worse in some patients.\n- One paper says more than 25% of patients had significant side effects after surgical treatment of patellofemoral instability.\nPhysiotherapist Jenny Mcconnell wrote in the medical journal Manual Therapy that:\nSome cases of patellofemoral instability are difficult to manage and, in fact, some treatments can make the patient feel worse. Frequently, the patient often bounces from practitioner to practitioner, physiotherapist to surgeon, seeking some relief of symptoms. However, their underlying source of pain is not well understood, so treatment can aggravate the symptoms.\nDoctors have put a lot of emphasis on medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction for the treatment of recurrent patellar dislocations/subluxations. Numerous techniques have been reported; however, there is no consensus regarding optimal reconstruction and in one paper a total of 164 complications occurred in 26% of patients. Side effects included patellar fracture, failures, and clinical instability on postoperative examination, loss of knee flexion, wound complications, and pain.(5)\nPatellofemoral instability – not addressing the whole knee leads to surgical complications\nA highly cited study in the The American journal of sports medicine from doctors at the University of Kentucky, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Sports Medicine also suggest that patients with medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction without additional stabilizing treatments suffered from a high rate of continued problems including 5% who continued with recurrent dislocations.(6)\nIn the March 2016 issue of Arthroscopy, university and researchers in Rome working with the Harvard Medical School found conflicting evidence for the use of Medial Patellofemoral Ligament Reconstruction combined With Bony Procedures (bone reshaping) for Patellar Instability. Enough so that they were unable to identify an absolute indication for this type of surgery.(7)\nThis supports research from the Mayo Clinic published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine that says when you have multiple knee ligament damages – such as in degenerative wear and tear or acute injury – the medial patellofemoral ligament plays a very insignificant role in knee instability and does not even need to be addressed. (8) Of course to a doctor experienced in regenerating ligaments, all ligaments play an important role. In surgery, many times supportive tissue is discarded.\nAthletes with pain often feel there is no other choice but a surgical procedure, even a drastic one\nAthletes with pain often feel there is no other choice but surgical procedures, even drastic ones. A good example of drastic surgery is the recommendation to surgically remove the patella in order to remove the pain. This sometimes does relieve the pain, but at a significant cost to the body. The strength to extend the knee is reduced by about 30 percent, and the force exerted in the knee is increased.\nThere are a host of other risks associated with surgery. The patient must realize that with each procedure and each shaving or cutting of tissue, NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) prescription, or cortisone shot, the odds of developing long-term arthritis are greatly increased. The key to keeping the knee strong is to stimulate the area to heal, not to cover up the pain with a cortisone shot or NSAID. Even worse is to eliminate the painful area by shaving or cutting. This just delays the pain for a few years until the remaining tissue becomes degenerated. The best approach for the athlete is to stimulate the area to heal.\nThe regenerative medicine option. Prolotherapy injections to pull the kneecap into place and keep it there.\nIn the research above you see that a first-time dislocation of the kneecap creates short and long-term problems of knee instability which leads to long-term problems of chronic patella subluxation or simply, chronic dislocation of the kneecap. This is also referred to as patellofemoral tracking syndrome. This is where the kneecap floats out of the groove on the femur (thigh bone) it is supposed to sit and glide up and down on.\nAs we have seen in the research above, this can equally effect an adolescent athlete as well as an older athlete.\nThe kneecap is supposed to stay in the middle of the knee, in its groove. But because of past dislocations or advanced knee instability, the kneecap wanders to the sides. When this occurs not only is there a problem of the maltracking patella, there is also a problem of accelerated wear and tear and the development of osteoarthritis. This can also lead to a problem of Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome.\nProlotherapy injections stabilize the unstable knee and regenerates damaged tissue.

30	How do public and private banks differ in costs and accessibility?	Public cord blood banks are free for donation but charge insurance companies when cells are used, while private banks cost $1,400-$2,300 initially plus $95-$125 annual storage fees. For accessibility, public bank donations are available to anyone needing treatment, but finding matches can be challenging with separate registries - Caucasians have 88% chance of finding matches while minorities have 58% chance. Private banks restrict access to only the donor family but guarantee availability if needed, though personal cord blood cannot be used to treat genetic diseases in the donor child.	['We are loading the information that you are looking for...\nTo minimize potential side effects, doctors most often use transplanted stem cells that match the patient’s own stem cells as closely as possible. People have different sets of proteins, called human leukocyte-associated (HLA) antigens, on the surface of their cells. The set of proteins, called the HLA type, is identified by a special blood test.\nUmbilical cord blood was once discarded as waste material but is now known to be a useful source of blood stem cells. Cord blood has been used to treat children with certain blood diseases since 1989 and research on using it to treat adults is making progress. So what are the current challenges for cord blood research and how may it be used – now and in the future?\nThere are some diseases on the list (like neuroblastoma cancer) where a child could use his or her own cord blood. However, most of the diseases on the proven treatment list are inherited genetic diseases. Typically, a child with a genetic disease would require a cord blood unit from a sibling or an unrelated donor.\nMost cells can make copies only of themselves. For example, a skin cell only can make another skin cell. Hematopoietic stem cells, however, can mature into different types of blood cells in the body. Hematopoietic stem cells also are found in blood and bone marrow in adults and children.\nPrior to freezing the cells, samples are taken for quality testing. Banks measure the number of cells that are positive for the CD34 marker, a protein that is used to estimate the number of blood-forming stem cells present. Typical cost, $150 to $200 per unit. They also measure the number of nucleated cells, another measure of stem cells, both before and after processing to determine the cell recovery rate. Typical expense, $35 per unit. A portion of the sample is submitted to check that there is no bacterial or fungal contamination. Typical expense, $75 per unit. Public banks will also check the ability of the sample to grow new cells by taking a culture called the CFU assay. Typical expense, $200 to $250 per unit.\nPro: It gives you that peace of mind that if anything did happen to your child, the doctors would have access to their blood. This could potentially be a great benefit, and you would have no idea what would have happened if it weren’t for this blood.\nThe parents who make the decision to store their baby’s cord blood and cord tissue are thinking ahead, wanting to do right from the start (even before the start), and taking steps to do whatever they can to protect their baby down the road. Today, many conscientious parents are also considering delayed cord clamping (DCC), a practice in which the umbilical cord is not clamped immediately but rather after it continues to pulse for an average of 30 seconds to 180 seconds. Many parents don’t realize that they can delay the clamping of the cord and still bank their baby’s cord blood. As noted early, our premium processing method, PrepaCyte-CB, is able to capture more immune system cells and reduce the greatest number of red blood cell contaminants. This makes it go hand in hand with delayed cord clamping because it is not as affected by volume, effectively making up for the smaller quantity with a superior quality. You can read more about delayed cord clamping vs. cord blood banking here.\nCord blood collection is a completely painless procedure that does not interfere with the birth or with mother-and-child bonding following the delivery. There is no risk to either the mother or baby. Cord blood collection rarely requires Blood Center staff to be present during the baby’s delivery. There is no cost to you for donating.\nUmbilical cord blood is being studied for potential use in a wide variety of life-threatening diseases because it is a rich source of blood stem cells. Transplantation of blood stem cells from umbilical cords has been used successfully to treat several pediatric blood diseases, including sickle cell anemia and cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma. This procedure is still considered investigational. There is currently no solid evidence that umbilical cord blood stem cells have the ability to be transformed into other types of cells, such as replacement nerve tissue or myelin-making cells.\nThe harvested bone marrow is then processed to remove blood and bone fragments. Harvested bone marrow can be combined with a preservative and frozen to keep the stem cells alive until they are needed. This technique is known as cryopreservation. Stem cells can be cryopreserved for many years.\nYes, stem cells can be used on the donor following chemo and radiation to repair the bone marrow. For a full list of treatments, please visit : http://cellsforlife.com/cord-blood-basics/diseases-treated-with-cord-blood-stem-cells/\nThis is only the beginning. Newborn stem cell research is advancing, and may yield discoveries that could have important benefits for families. CBR’s mission is to support the advancement of newborn stem cell research, with the hope that the investment you are making now will be valuable to your family in the future. CBR offers a high quality newborn stem cell preservation system to protect these precious resources for future possible benefits for your family.\nA major limitation of cord blood transplantation is that the blood obtained from a single umbilical cord does not contain as many haematopoeitic stem cells as a bone marrow donation. Scientists believe this is the main reason that treating adult patients with cord blood is so difficult: adults are larger and need more HSCs than children. A transplant containing too few HSCs may fail or could lead to slow formation of new blood in the body in the early days after transplantation. This serious complication has been partially overcome by transplanting blood from two umbilical cords into larger children and adults. Results of clinical trials into double cord blood transplants (in place of bone marrow transplants) have shown the technique to be very successful. Some researchers have also tried to increase the total number of HSCs obtained from each umbilical cord by collecting additional blood from the placenta.\nThe European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) has also adopted a position on the ethical aspects of umbilical cord blood banking. The EGE is of the opinion that “support for public cord blood banks for allogeneic transplantations should be increased and long term functioning should be assured.” They further stated that “the legitimacy of commercial cord blood banks for autologous use should be questioned as they sell a service which has presently no real use regarding therapeutic options.”\n“This is a medical service that has to be done when your baby’s cells arrive and you certainly want them to be handled by good equipment and good technicians,” says Frances Verter, Ph.D., founder and director of Parent’s Guide to Cord Blood Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to educating parents about cord blood donation and cord blood therapists. “It’s just not going to be cheap.” Although the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) states cord blood has been used to treat certain diseases successfully, there isn’t strong evidence to support cord blood banking. If a family does choose to bank cord blood, the AAP recommends public cord blood banking (instead of private) to reduce costs.\nMost of the diseases on the proven treatment list are inherited genetic diseases. Typically, a child with a genetic disease would require cord blood unit from a sibling or an unrelated donor. Having a sibling cord blood unit can be a great advantage as research shows that treatments using cord blood from a family member are about twice as successful as treatments using cord blood from a non-relative.9a, 17\nIn this way, cord blood offers a useful alternative to bone marrow transplants for some patients. It is easier to collect than bone marrow and can be stored frozen until it is needed. It also seems to be less likely than bone marrow to cause immune rejection or complications such as Graft versus Host Disease. This means that cord blood does not need to be as perfectly matched to the patient as bone marrow (though some matching is still necessary).\nYour baby’s newborn stem cells are transported to our banking facilities by our medical courier partner, and you can receive tracking updates. Each sample is processed and stored with great care at our laboratory in Tucson, Arizona. CBR’s Quality Standard means we test every cord blood sample for specific quality metrics.\nAnthony’s doctors found a match for him through the New York Blood Center’s National Cord Blood Program, a public cord blood bank. Unlike private banks, public banks do not charge to collect cord blood, they charge a patients insurance company when cells are used. And once it is entered in the public system, the blood is available to anyone who needs it.\nAfter your baby is born, the umbilical cord and placenta are usually thrown away. Because you are choosing to donate, the blood left in the umbilical cord and placenta will be collected and tested. Cord blood that meets standards for transplant will be stored at the public cord blood bank until needed by a patient. (It is not saved for your family.)\nGenerally, cord blood can only be used to treat children up to 65 lbs. This is because there simply aren’t enough stem cells on average in one unit of cord blood to treat an adult. Through our Cord Blood 2.0 technology, we have been able to collect up to twice as many stem cells as the industry average. Getting more stem cells increases the chance of being able to treat someone later in life.\nCBR created the world’s only collection device designed specifically for cord blood stem cells. CBR has the highest average published cell recovery rate in the industry – 99% – resulting in the capture of 20% more of the most important cells than other common processing methods.\nToday, many conditions may be treatable with cord blood as part of a stem cell transplant, including various cancers and blood, immune, and metabolic disorders. Preserving these cells now may provide your family potential treatment options in the future.\nThe evolution of stem cell therapies has paved the way for further research being conducted through FDA-regulated clinical trials to uncover their potential in regenerative medicine applications. Cord Blood Registry is the first family newborn stem cell company to partner with leading research institutions to establish FDA-regulated clinical trials exploring the potential regenerative ability of cord blood stem cells to help treat conditions that have no cure today, including: acquired hearing loss, autism, cerebral palsy, and pediatric stroke. In fact, 73% of the stem cell units released by CBR have been used for experimental regenerative therapies – more than any other family cord blood bank in the world.\nPrivate cord blood banking is recommended for families with a history of certain diseases. Specifically, these are families with diseases that harm the blood and immune system, such as leukemia and certain cancers, sickle-cell anemia, and some metabolic disorders. Why? The type of stem cells in cord blood can form all kinds of blood cells that can help treat these diseases.\nThe main reason for this requirement is to give the cord blood bank enough time to complete the enrollment process. For the safety of any person who might receive the cord blood donation, the mother must pass a health history screening. And for ethical reasons, the mother must give informed consent.\nCollected cord blood is cryopreserved and then stored in a cord blood bank for future transplantation. Cord blood collection is typically depleted of red blood cells before cryopreservation to ensure high rates of stem cell recovery.\nUmbilical cord blood contains haematopoietic (blood) stem cells. These cells are able to make the different types of cell in the blood – red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Haematopoietic stem cells, purified from bone marrow or blood, have long been used in stem cell treatments for leukaemia, blood and bone marrow disorders, cancer (when chemotherapy is used) and immune deficiencies.\nMarketing materials by Viacord and Cord Blood Registry, the two largest companies, do not mention that cord blood stem cells cannot be used by the child for genetic diseases, although the fine print does state that cord blood may not be effective for all of the listed conditions.\nIn most cases, the success of allogeneic transplantation depends in part on how well the HLA antigens of the donor’s stem cells match those of the recipient’s stem cells. The higher the number of matching HLA antigens, the greater the chance that the patient’s body will accept the donor’s stem cells. In general, patients are less likely to develop a complication known as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) if the stem cells of the donor and patient are closely matched.\nCord blood holds promise for future medical procedures. Scientists are still studying more ways to treat more diseases with cord blood. At Duke University, for example, researchers are using patients’ own cord blood in trials for cerebral palsy and Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (a condition in which the brain does not receive enough oxygen). Trials are also under way for the treatment of autism at the Sutter Neuroscience Institute in Sacramento, California.\nEstimated first minimum monthly payment.

Please see here for more details.\nStem cells are often extracted from cord blood and bone marrow.Different cells have different life cycles, and many are constantly regenerating, but when damage occurs and the body needs to come up with a new supply of cells to heal itself, it relies on the stem cell’s ability to quickly create more cells to repair the wound. Herein lays the potential for the introduction of new stem cells to enhance or be the driving factor in the healing process.\nFAQ172: Designed as an aid to patients, this document sets forth current information and opinions related to women’s health. The information does not dictate an exclusive course of treatment or procedure to be followed and should not be construed as excluding other acceptable methods of practice. Variations, taking into account the needs of the individual patient, resources, and limitations unique to the institution or type of practice, may be appropriate.\nA stem cell has the potential to become one of many different types of cells. Stem cells are unique cells: They have the ability to become many different types of cells, and they can replicate rapidly. Stem cells play a huge part in the body’s healing process, and the introduction of new stem cells has always showed great promise in the treatment of many conditions. It wasn’t until we found out where and how to isolate these cells that we started using them for transplants. Although a person’s own stem cells are always 100 percent compatible, there are risks in using someone else’s stem cells, especially if the donor and recipient are not immediately related. The discovery of certain markers allows us to see how compatible a donor’s and host’s cells will be. The relatively recent discovery of stem cells in the umbilical cord’s blood has proven advantageous over acquiring stem cells from other sources. Researchers are currently conducting clinical trials with stem cells, adding to the growing list of 80 diseases which they can treat.\nAs the research into umbilical cord blood and it’s therapeutic use for blood diseases has grown, so has the question as to whether people should privately store the cord blood of their offspring for future use. A recent paper on this issue by Mahendra Rao and colleagues advocates the practice of cord blood banking (for treatment of blood diseases) but in the context of public cord blood banks rather than a private cord blood banks. Any adult needing treated would need at least two cord blood samples that are immune compatible. So one sample will not be sufficient. A child might only need one cord blood sample but in the case of childhood leukaemia there is a risk that pre-leukemic cells are present in cord blood sample – and so the child could not use their own cells for therapy.\nPrivate (commercial) cord banks will store the donated blood for use by the donor and family members only. They can be expensive. These banks charge a fee for processing and an annual fee for storage.', 'Depending on the predetermined period of storage, the initial fee can range from $900 to $2100. Annual storage fees after the initial storage fee are approximately $100. It is common for storage facilities to offer prepaid plans at a discount and payment plans to help make the initial storage a more attractive option for you and your family.\nYour baby’s umbilical cord is made up of tissue and contains blood. Both cord blood and cord tissue are rich sources of powerful stem cells. Cord blood stem cells are currently used in transplant medicine to regenerate healthy blood and immune systems. These cells are being researched for their ability to act like our body’s own personal repair kit and may be able to help our bodies heal in new ways.\nFor families who wish to donate cord blood to a public bank, the biggest hurdle may be finding a nearby hospital that collects cord blood for donation. Most public banks only work with select hospitals in their community. In the U.S., there are only about 200 hospitals that collect cord blood donations. Find out if there is a donation hospital near you.\nHowever, cord blood transplants also have limitations. Treatment of adults with cord blood typically requires two units of cord blood to treat one adult. Clinical trials using “double cord blood transplantation” for adults have demonstrated outcomes similar to use of other sources of HSCs, such as bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood. Current studies are being done to expand a single cord blood unit for use in adults. Cord blood can also only be used to treat blood diseases. No therapies for non-blood-related diseases have yet been developed using HSCs from either cord blood or adult bone marrow.\nThe umbilical cord is a rich source of two main types of stem cells: cord blood stem cells and cord tissue stem cells. Through the science of cord blood and cord tissue banking, these stem cells can help nurture life, long after your baby’s birth.\nLifebankUSA seeks mothers in NEW YORK & NEW JERSEY ONLY who will donate both their cord blood and their placenta. The donations support an international registry, clinical trials and research. Donations can be taken from any hospital, but mothers must register at least 8 weeks prior to delivery and pass a health screening.\nCord blood stem cells are classified as adult (or non-embryonic) stem cells. Embryonic stem cells (ESC) are believed to be more advantageous for the treatment of disease or injury due to their pluripotent nature; that is, they have the ability to differentiate into all the cells present in the human body derived from the three germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm). Adult stem cells are multipotent, implying that they can only differentiate into a limited number of cells typically within the same “family” (e.g., hematopoietic stem cells give rise to red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets).\nCBR Cord Blood Education Specialists are available 7 days a week (Monday – Friday 6 AM – 9 PM PST and Saturday – Sunday 6 AM – 4 PM PST) to respond to consumer inquiries. In addition, consumers may request to schedule a call with a CBR Cord Blood Education Specialist at a specific date and time.\nCord blood is used the same way that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is used to reconstitute bone marrow following radiation treatment for various blood cancers, and for various forms of anemia. Its efficacy is similar as well.\nWe are excited to share an advancement in #newborn #stemcell science. A recent study published findings showing the safety of using a child’s own cord blood stem cells for #autism. Learn more on The CBR Blog! blog.cordblood.com/2018/02/resear…\nWhen all the processing and testing is complete, the cord blood stem cells are frozen in cryogenic nitrogen freezers at -196° C until they are requested for patient therapy. Public banks are required to complete the entire laboratory processing and freeze the cord blood stem cells within 48 hours of collection. This is to insure the highest level of stem cell viability. The accreditation agencies allow family banks a window of 72 hours.\nChoosing a bank (specifically a private bank) for her daughter’s cord blood made perfect sense to Julie Lehrman, a mom based in Chicago. “We wanted the extra assurance that we were doing everything we could to keep Lexi healthy,” Lehrman says. “I was older when Lexi was born, and there’s a lot we didn’t know about my mom’s health history, so we felt that we were making a smart decision.” Fortunately, Lexi was born healthy, and neither she nor anyone else in the family has needed the cord blood since it was stored seven years ago. But Lehrman has no regrets; she still feels the family made a wise investment. “Lexi or her brother or even one of us could still need that blood in the future, so I’m thankful that we have it.” But banking your child’s cord blood may not be the right decision for you. Read on to see if you should opt for private cord blood banking.\nIn March 2004, the European Union Group on Ethics (EGE) has issued Opinion No.19 titled Ethical Aspects of Umbilical Cord Blood Banking. The EGE concluded that “[t]he legitimacy of commercial cord blood banks for autologous use should be questioned as they sell a service, which has presently, no real use regarding therapeutic options. Thus they promise more than they can deliver. The activities of such banks raise serious ethical criticisms.”\nCord blood donation doesn’t cost anything for parents. Public cord blood banks pay for everything which includes the collection, testing, and storing of umbilical cord blood. This means that cord blood donation is not possible in every hospital.\nDennis Michael Todd, PhD, joined Community Blood Services as its President and CEO in 2000. Community Blood Services operates the NJ Cord Blood Bank and The HLA Registry bone marrow donor center, both of which are affiliated with the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). In 2012, the blood center expects to distribute over 85,000 units of red cells and 20,000 platelets to hospitals and medical centers throughout northern NJ and Orange County, NY. Dr. Todd is presently a member of the NMDP Executive Committee and Chairman of the Finance Committee. He is a member of the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT), the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR), the AABB, the American Association of Bioanalysts, and the New Jersey Society of Blood Bank Professionals.\nIf siblings are a genetic match, a cord blood transplant is a simple procedure that is FDA approved to treat over 80 diseases. However, there are a few considerations you should make before deciding to only bank one of your children’s blood:\nNot surprisingly, this emotional pitch is working — especially because the seemingly unlimited potential of stem cells has dominated the news in recent years. From 2003 to 2004, for example, the number of couples opting to use a private bank increased by 55 percent to 271,000. The three biggest companies — who have the majority of the approximately $250 million market — are vying for business.\nIf you do decide to bank your baby’s cord blood, there’s one more thing to keep in mind: It’s best not to make it a last-minute decision. You should coordinate with the bank before your baby is born so nothing is left to chance.\nCord blood banking is not always cheap. It’s completely free to donate blood to a public cord blood bank, but private banks charge $1,400 to $2,300 for collecting, testing, and registering, plus an annual $95 to $125 storing fee.\nComplicating matters further, each public bank has its own registry, so transplant centers must search many different databases to find a match for a patient. Currently, a Caucasian patient has an 88 percent chance of finding a cord-blood match through a public-bank registry, and minorities have a 58 percent chance. (Collection hospitals tend to be in areas with higher rates of Caucasian births, and parents from certain ethnic groups are wary of donating for religious or cultural reasons.)\nA large challenge facing many areas of medical research and treatments is correcting misinformation. Some companies advertise services to parents suggesting they should pay to freeze their child’s cord blood in a blood bank in case it’s needed later in life. Studies show it is highly unlikely that the cord blood will ever be used for their child. However, clinicians strongly support donating cord blood to public blood banks. This greatly helps increase the supply of cord blood to people who need it.\nAccording to Cord Blood Registry, cord blood is defined as “the blood that remains in your baby’s umbilical cord after the cord has been cut, is a rich source of unique stem cells that can be used in medical treatments.” Cord blood has been shown to help treat over 80 diseases, such as leukemia, other cancers, and blood disorders. This cord blood, which can be safely removed from your newborn’s already-cut umbilical cord, can be privately stored for the purpose of possible use in the future for your child or family member. (It can also be donated to a public bank, but this is not widely available)\nGift of Life is a non-profit charity that seeks to help Jewish patients find a transplant match. They recruit both bone marrow donors and cord blood donations from the Jewish community. Gift of Life operates their own accredited cord blood laboratory that participates in the national NMDP network.\nThere are several cord blood banks that are accredited by the American Association of Blood Banks. Most offer information on cord blood banking and provide private cord blood banking services. With a little research, you should be able to locate a credible cord blood bank online.\nIt would be possible for a healthy child’s cord blood to be used to treat a sibling with leukemia, but the banks’ literature doesn’t spell out that distinction. In the last 10 years, almost all of the approximately 70 cord-blood transplants that have used privately stored blood were given to relatives with preexisting conditions, not to the donors themselves.\nThe therapeutic potential of stem cells from the umbilical cord is vast. Cord blood is already being used in the treatment of nearly 80 life-threatening diseases2, and researchers continue to explore it’s potential. Duke University Medical Center is currently using cord blood stem cells in a Phase II clinical trial to see if it benefits kids with Autism. The number of clinical trials using cord tissue stem cells in human patients has increased to approximately 150 since the first clinical trial in 2007. Cord tissue stem cells are also being studied for the potential use in kids with Autism – a Phase I Clinical Trial is underway.\nPublic cord blood banks do not pay the fees associated with transporting the stored cord blood to the necessary medical facility if they are needed for a transplant, so if this is not covered by your insurance, it could be very costly to use stem cells from a public cord blood bank\n American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Hematology/Oncology, American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Allergy/Immunology, Bertram H. Lubin, and William T. Shearer, “Cord Blood Banking for Potential Future Transplantation,” Pediatrics 119 (2007): 165-170.\nMost of the diseases on the proven treatment list are inherited genetic diseases. Typically, a child with a genetic disease would require cord blood unit from a sibling or an unrelated donor. Having a sibling cord blood unit can be a great advantage as research shows that treatments using cord blood from a family member are about twice as successful as treatments using cord blood from a non-relative.9a, 17\nPart of the reason for the dominance of these three companies in terms of the total number of units stored is that they are three of the oldest cord blood banks within the U.S., founded in 1992, 1993, and 1989, respectively. All three of these cord blood banks also support cord blood research and clinical trials.\nLike any insurance, cord-blood banking isn’t cheap. Banks initially charge from $1,000 to $2,000 to collect and process the stem-cell units, which are stored for a family’s exclusive use. When you factor in additional costs for shipping (about $150 for a medical courier), the doctor’s collection fee (prices can range from $150 to $500), and annual storage fees averaging $100 per year for 18 years, parents can expect to pay up to $4,000 in expenses not covered by insurance.\nHeart disease is one of the deadliest killers in the world to date. Congestive heart failure, a condition found secondary to many major cardiac diseases, possesses its own high mortality rate. Fifty percent of those diagnosed with congestive heart failure will die within the…']	['<urn:uuid:b17ae376-cf62-4774-b298-63ee81024d76>', '<urn:uuid:3a0cfca5-234d-41cf-9f09-1a829ee70088>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	11	89	4978
31	ras protein activation deactivation mechanisms tools	Ras protein activation can be analyzed using infrared difference spectroscopy combined with His-Tag anchoring and attenuated total reflectance, which provides atomic resolution of structural changes during on/off switching. For deactivation, Ras has intrinsic GTPase activity, and tumor suppressor proteins called GAPs (like NF1/Neurofibromin) enhance this activity 1000-fold by binding to Ras, effectively shutting it down.	['Interaction between proteins and pharmaceuticals can now be analyzed in detail\nRUB-Biophysicists use surface-sensitive spectroscopy\nThe new method: from three to one\nWith infrared difference spectroscopy, researchers follow dynamic processes in proteins. For a long time, these processes could only be observed in light-activated proteins, but not in proteins that are activated by binding with ligands – but this is usually how many illness relevant molecules are activated. To analyze the dynamics of such proteins, researchers have to fasten them to the measurement surface and pour a pharmacological-substance over them; the proteins can then interact with and be activated by this substance. Even though this binding technique is possible, it cannot be used for all proteins. The RUB-Team worked around this problem by combining infrared (IR) spectroscopy with a surface-sensitive technique (attenuated total reflectance) and so-called “His-Tagging” (anchoring proteins to the measurement surface).\nAttenuated total reflectance: bringing the infrared beam to all proteins\nIn conventional IR spectroscopy, an infrared beam is passed through a liquid sample; part of the light is absorbed by the proteins, which allows researchers to draw conclusions about their structure. The RUB-researchers beamed the infrared light through a germanium crystal, on whose surface proteins were anchored. At the boundaries of the crystal the light is reflected over and over, thereby spreading throughout the crystal (attenuated total reflectance). During this process, some of the light waves leave the crystal and reach the proteins that are fastened to its surface. A similar technique, the Surface Plasmon Resonance, is the standard for use in the pharmaceutical industry, but does not have the atomic resolution capabilities of the new technique.\nPart of the chain: the His-Tag\nThis bonding of the proteins to the crystal succeeds through usage of the His-Tag, a simple amino acid chain, which is commonly attached to proteins today to enable their biochemical study – it is essentially a universal adapter. Through the His-Tag the RUB-researchers were able to anchor the protein to the germanium crystal. As a result the molecules were firmly bound to the measurement surface, which transmits the infrared light to the proteins by the process of attenuated total reflectance. The big advantage: an abundance of proteins are already fitted with the His-Tag; therefore examining them with the new method is unproblematic. All other proteins to which a His-Tag is attached can now also be accessed by IR spectroscopy. “This will help answer a multitude of biological and medical questions,” Gerwert said.\nEstablishment of the new method with the switch protein Ras\nThe RUB-Team first tried their new method on the switch protein Ras, the central on/off switch for cell growth. Defect, or oncogenic Ras, is one of the cells most frequently responsible for causing cancer. The researchers succeeded in fastening Ras to the measurement surface with the His-Tag, and then activating the Ras by binding it to a ligand. “The technique is so sensitive that we could resolve the signal of a five nanometer thick protein layer. That’s about 1/10000 of the diameter of a human hair,” RUB-researcher Dr. Jörn Güldenhaupt, who contributed significantly to the development of the new method, said. Even the smallest structural changes during the Ras protein’s switch from its “on” to its “off” state were recognized with the “protein-nanoscope.”\nFunding for the project came from the Protein Research Department at the RUB, from the state of NRW in the framework of the Center for Vibrational Microscopy (CVM) and from the SFB 642, “GTP and ATP Dependent Membrane Processes,” whose speaker is Prof. Gerwert.\nP. Pinkerneil, J. Güldenhaupt, K. Gerwert, C. Kötting (2012): Surface-attached polyhistidine-tag proteins characterized by FTIR difference spectroscopy, ChemPhysChem, doi: 10.1002/cphc.201200358', 'There’s a basic principle in biological homeostasis (and it’s also true in cybernetics) that for every process that turns something on, you have an anti-process that turns it off. When you look at what’s going on inside the cell, you’ll often get the impression that it’s spinning its wheels — every protein, for instance, is being degraded at about the same rate that it’s being synthesized. The whole cell is in a state of dynamic equilibrium, in which it might look like the concentration of some protein is constant overall, but when you look closely, individual protein molecules are being constantly made, instantly targeted for destruction, and dismantled…only to be nearly instantly replaced by a duplicate. Everything is in a state of flux, and it looks terribly wasteful, but it means that everything is fluid and flexible and the cell is incredibly responsive to subtle cues.\nLast time I wrote about oncogenes, genes that are activators of crucial cellular processes like cell division, and I told you that these play a role in cancer by sending faulty signals that switch on uncontrolled cell division. Given the above principle, you might expect that if there are gene products that turn on cell division, there ought to also be gene products that turn off cell division, a kind of anti-oncogene. And there are! They’re called tumor suppressor genes.\nWhile acting in opposition to oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes typically exhibit another difference in behavior that sets them apart. Cancer causing mutations in oncogenes are usually dominant: that is, the mutation doesn’t just knock out the gene, it has to make a hyperactive gene, and just one mutant copy gone rogue is enough to start switching on cellular activity. Tumor suppressor gene mutations tend to be recessive.\nYou’ve usually got two copies of every gene. A tumor suppressor works to shut down renegade activity, and a cancer-causing mutation in one is most often simply going to be a mutation that destroys the gene — but since you’ve got two copies, it has a backup. Cancer needs to kill both copies of the tumor suppressor to escape from its anti-tumor actions.\nThe best known tumor suppressor gene is BRCA1, and it exhibits this behavior. BRCA1 is a good gene — it’s working to protect you from breast cancer. For most of us, every cell in our body has two functional copies of BRCA1. It’s like having two cops patrolling the beat, prepared to fight off any cancer threat, and for cancer to succeed, it has to kill off both. Even one left functional can suppress any effort by the cell to go hyperactive and proliferate. A mutation that knocks out one copy is rare, but two mutations that knock out both are even more rare — it follows two-hit kinetics, which means you multiply the probability of the two events together.\nYou will occasionally hear about someone being at high risk of cancer because they carry a bad allele of BRCA1 — Angeline Jolie was in the news about this recently. What has happened here is that the person was born inheriting one broken copy of the BRCA1 gene — their cells only have one cop on the beat. They aren’t born with cancer — that one copy of BRCA1 is sufficient to keep them safe — but now they are at much higher risk of an accidental mutation taking out their sole protector than if they had two.\nAnother well known tumor suppressor gene is Rb, the gene that when mutant can lead to retinoblastoma, or cancers of the eye. It also exhibits two hit kinetics, in that familial retinoblastoma is caused by inheritance of one mutant Rb allele, so that all it takes is one mutation later in life to lead to cancer. Sporadic retinoblastoma, that is retinoblastoma without previous examples in the family, is much rarer, because it requires a first somatic mutation and a second mutation later to take out the second copy.\nHaving an enabling mutation in one copy at birth so greatly increases the chance of retinoblastoma that afflicted individuals are likely to have bilateral cancers affecting both eyes, while it’s so rare in sporadic cases that it is almost always unilateral, affecting only one eye.\nOK, you understand the principle. Last time, I wrote about the oncogene Ras, which, to make it simple switches on the mitotic machinery and promotes cell division. Does it have an anti-gene product that opposes Ras and switches off cell division?\nOf course there is. Several actually. One example: recall that I told you that Ras is activated by binding GTP, and deactivated by converting GTP to GDP, and that Ras itself has GTPase activity and therefore works to switch itself off. There are also tumor suppressor proteins that are called GAPs, or GTPase activating proteins, that enhance Ras’s GTPase activity. One of them, called NF1 or Neurofibromin, binds to Ras and elevates its potency as a GTPase approximately 1000-fold — it basically makes Ras ultra-good at shutting down and doing nothing.\nOncogenes and tumor suppressors are the yin and yang of cellular regulation. Cancer cells often contain hyperactive oncogenes, and have shut down tumor suppressors…which suggests that one strategy for treating cancer is to develop inhibitors of oncogenes, and to repair, replace, or elevate expression of tumor suppressors. And that’s a rather pat explanation of some viable general strategies that of course encounter all kinds of additional complexities.\nDonovan S, Shannon KM, Bollag G (2002) GTPase activating proteins: critical regulators of intracellular signaling..

32	My plumber gave me two quotes - $300 for fixing my current water heater versus $2000 for installing pressure regulation. Could you help me understand if either of these investments would save me money in the long run?	Both options can provide savings, but in different ways. A water pressure regulator installation, while more expensive upfront at $2000, can save $50-$150 per year through reduced water consumption (up to 1/3 less water usage), lower energy bills from reduced hot water heating, and decreased sewer charges. Water heater repairs at $300 are cheaper initially, but repairs will become more frequent as the unit ages, and a failing water heater can cause expensive water damage. Additionally, without proper pressure regulation, high water pressure can damage water heaters and other appliances, leading to more frequent repairs and replacements.	['Most national and local plumbing codes require that a water pressure reducing valve is installed in buildings where water supply pressures\nexceed 80 psi.\nExcessive water pressures can burst pipes, cause dripping faucets, and can even cause rupture and explosion of both cold water pressure tanks\nand hot water storage tanks\n- What is a Water Pressure Regulator?\nAlso called water pressure reducing valves, they are compact, inexpensive regulators that perform two functions:\n(1) they automatically reduce the high incoming water pressure from the city mains to provide a lower, more functional\npressure for distribution in the home; (2) they “regulate” by maintaining a set pressure in the home usually 50 lbs. –thereby\ninsuring that the home piping and appliances operate under a safe, more moderate, but satisfactory pressure.\n- What is water pressure?\nWhen a fixture in a home is opened and water flows from it, it is because the water is “pushed.”\nThis “push” is pressure. The speed at which water flows from the opened outlet depends on the amount of “push” or pressure,\nwhich exists at that time in the system. In short, the higher the pressure, the stronger the “push” behind the water.\n- What is wrong with high water pressure?\nHigh water pressure, which is generally considered anything above 60 lbs., has some advantage, such as in fire fighting\nsystems. However, in the home plumbing system, it can be damaging because water, with a strong “push” behind it, can\nerode or wear away many materials and cause leaking water heaters, banging water pipes, dripping faucets, dishwasher\nand clothes washer noise and breakdown, and leaking water pipes. Therefore, water flowing at a rate in excess of that\nnecessary to satisfy normal fixture or appliance demands becomes damaging, wasteful and reduces the life expectancy of\nequipment in the system. But, probably most important to the average homeowner is that it can add to the cost of water,\nenergy and waste water bills.\n- Does high water pressure cause “water hammer”?\nYes, and water hammer is very simply the noise generated by the shocks of high-speed water flowing in a pipe when\na fixture is suddenly closed. The sudden stoppage causes a “bounce-back” of the water and is called water hammer,\ncausing banging pipes, noise systems and damage to appliances. It might be compared to driving your car at slow speed into\na wall where the effect is negligible. However, if you drove the car at a much higher speed, the impact would be greater and,\nconsequently, so would the bounce-back or shock. Another description of the water hammer effect of high water pressure can be\neasily demonstrated. First, walk around a sharp corner and then run around the same corner. We can equate walking around\nthe corner to a lower, more functional, controlled water pressure. However, when you run around the corner, the momentum\nforces your body to swing in a wider, uncontrolled arc. This principle is based on the fact that moving objects, and this includes\nwater, tend to move in a straight line. They resist changes in direction. Therefore, in a home where the piping has many changes in\ndirection, water hammer shock can be limited by reducing the water pressure.\n- What is the difference in water flow from\na fixture when the pressure is at 100 lbs. vs. a pressure of 50 lbs.?\nReducing the pressure from 100 lbs. to 50 lbs. will result in a saving of approximately 1/3\nbecause 1/3 less water flows. At this lower pressure remember, there is more “push” behind the water at 100 lbs. than at 50 lbs., and most of\nthis water is wasted. A moderate savings would result if your supply pressure was 65 lbs. However, even at this lower pressure,\nsavings with a regulator would be 20%.\n- Are there any studies to support this savings figure?\nYes, in 1971 the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission conducted a test program in 2,400 dwelling units\nthat has attracted widespread interest from more than 40 states and various foreign countries. One of the devices\nused in their conservation study was a water pressure regulator. It is interesting to note that their report concluded\nthat in test locations using regulators, there was a water consumption reduction of 30% in October and November and 37%\n- Where are Water Pressure Regulators most commonly used?\nWater pressure regulators are commonly installed at the mater in residential, commercial and industrial buildings.\nThis location is desirable because it then controls the water pressure flowing to all appliances and outlets within\nthe building and provides an inexpensive means of supplying lower, more functional water pressure to outlets and appliances.\n- Why do we now call Regulators “Primary Conservation Controls”?\nMost people have considered regulators as pressure controls because, as described in the foregoing, they are used to\nprotect appliances and piping from the effects of high water pressure. However, because of water and energy shortage\nand cost problems, regulators have become increasingly more important because they automatically provide the advantage\nof conserving water and energy.\n- How do Regulators save water?\nAs mentioned before, 1/3 less water flows at 50 lbs. than at 100 lbs. Therefore, when you reduce the city main pressure\nto a more moderate pressure of 50 lbs., you can look forward to conserving up to 1/3, or more, of the water previously consumed\nand this will be reflected on your water bills.\n- How much does a typical family of four use?\nA typical family of four uses an average of 255 gallons of water each day for interior plumbing. This is broken down\nby: dish washing – 15 gallons; cooking/drinking – 12 gallons; utility sink – 5 gallons; laundry –35 gallons; bathing – 80 gallons;\nbathroom sink – 8 gallons; toilet – 100 gallons. When you multiply this by a year, typical family usage totals 93,000 gallons of water.\nYour family, particularly if it includes teenagers, would undoubtedly use more than the above averages.\n- How do Regulators affect the wastewater system?\nWhen we can save 1/3 of the water previously consumed, this also represents a similar saving of water, which will not\nbe going into the sewer system where it has to be treated. Water does not evaporate after we use it and it has to be\npiped to the wastewater system. Many sewer bill taxes or surcharges are based on the amount of water you use, with the\nassumption that this water is going into the wastewater system. This is billed to you as sewer surcharge and, in many cases,\nthe sewer tax can equal the water cost. Therefore, when pressure regulators\nsave 1/3 of the metered water, they also contribute\nto saving up to 1/3 of the wastewater load and this is extremely important because it benefits both the user, by a lower sewer bill,\nand the community, as this is water they do not have to treat.\n- How do Water Pressure Regulators save on energy?\nThe Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 30% of the water used in households is heated and, in order to heat this\nwater, it takes energy. Logically, therefore, if a pressure regulator can reduce consumption by 1/3, we automatically cut down on\nthe amount of hot water we’re using in lavatories and showers and, therefore, it follows that we automatically reduce the amount of\nenergy required to heat that load. Thus, it can be easily seen that water conservation has a direct relationship to energy\nconservation. An average shower, for example, costs approximately 17 cents in energy and a shave with the faucet running cost 10\ncents in energy.\n- How do these savings benefit the water and energy utilities?\nA high rise office building in Chicago was designed using water conservation products which resulted in savings of more than\n3,000,000 gallons of water per year. This is significant in that the municipal water utility did not have to pump that extra\ngallonage, the water purification plant didn’t have to treat it, the building itself saved on pumping of 3,000,000 gallons, and\nthere must have been significant savings in energy by conserving hot water. Also, there were further savings by the fact that\n3,000,000 gallons of water, or the normal portion thereof, did not have to be distributed to the wastewater system and consequently\nthe water treatment plant did not have to retreat this water. The heating of water takes energy and it should also be remembered that\n“pumping” water from one place to another also requires a considerable amount of energy.\n- How do Regulators save on maintenance?\nWe have previously described the effects of high water pressure on piping and appliances. By having these appliances work under\na lower pressure, their life expectancy will be much longer and will also cut down on service calls caused by problems with dish\nwashers and clothes washers, leaky water heaters, leaking water pipes and the potential water damage which could be resulting.\n- Do codes require Water Pressure Reducing Valves?\nYes. They are required by the Federal Housing Administration, the regional plumbing codes such as IAPMO, Southern Building Code,\nand BOCA, and numerous city and state codes. The requirement is that whenever the city main water pressure exceeds 80 lbs.,\na regulator must be installed. However, because of the recently acknowledged advantages of regulators\nconservation wise, regulators\ncould be economically installed even where supply pressures are in the vicinity of 60 lbs. Because of the water and energy saving\nbenefits they can provide.\n- How long will a Regulator last?\nRegulators have been described as “life-of-mortgage” products, because historically a malfunctioning pressure regulator\nis not replaced but simply cleaned or repaired via an inexpensive service kit.\nDesign wise, it is similar to the kitchen\nfaucet in that dirt or foreign matter on the seating area can cause problems and actually it is no more difficult to repair a\nregulator than it is to fix the kitchen faucet.\n- If I install a Pressure Regulator, what savings can I expect?\nAn average savings would be from $50 to $150 per year, probably much higher.\nBased on the fact that 1/3 less water flows at 50 lbs. than 100 lbs., you can expect to save up to 1/3 of the\nwater previously consumed. As a typical family of four uses 90,000 gallons per year, that would mean a savings\nof approximately 30,000 gallons of water. The higher the pressure, the higher the savings. Lower pressures result in less\nsavings. (Your water Co. can provide the rate.)\nRemember also, however, that 1/3 of the water used in homes is heated; so 1/3 of\nthe 30,000 gallons of water saved divided by 2 to reflect a cold water mixing factor would mean a savings in heating up to 5,000\ngallons of hot water per year. If you figure 4 cents to heat gallon of water, the savings would be $200.00.\nYou can also figure on a savings in your sewer surcharge bill, since most of the 30,000 gallons of water saved will not be\ngoing into the wastewater system, therefore, you will not be assessed on that. (Contact your local authority for any assessment charges.)\nYou would also have to figure the savings generated by not having to have appliances repaired or replaced more frequently.\nThis is a nebulous figure but, based on your own experience over the past years, you could look for a reduction in the\nfrequency of maintenance and certainly for an improved performance by these appliances.\n- Should we consider using other water and energy conservation devices?\nCertainly, The water pressure regulator we’re talking about today is the nub of a conservation program; but you should also\nconsider flow control devices, low-flush toilets, improved water heating equipment and better disciplined habits by the user.\nHowever, if none of these devices were installed, the water pressure regulator would still serve to contribute important and\nsignificant savings in energy and water, resulting in average savings of anywhere from $50 to $150 per year, or more depending\non your local rates.\n- Do flow-restricting devices actually save water?\nYes, and they can effectively be installed on showerheads, fixtures and\ntank less heaters in boilers. Many showerheads,\nfor example, supply water at a rate of 6 pm. Applying a 3 pm flow restrictor will cut the flow in half providing savings\nin water and energy . It should be remembered however that their capacity is based on a “fixed” supply pressure like 50 lbs.\nand operating under a higher pressure will permit greater flow. That’s why we say a water regulator is the “hub” of a program\nbecause it maintains a constant pressure throughout the home, thereby even improving the performance of flow-restricting devices.\n- What are some tips the user can employ to save water and energy?\nPut a stopper in your sink or use a dishpan when you wash dishes. Washing with running water uses 30 gallons per meal.\nKeep a bottle of drinking water in the refrigerator – running the water from the faucet until cold will waste a gallon.\nWait until you have a full nine-pound wash before you run your washing machine. The average machine uses 50 gallons per load.\nTurn the hot water off while you shave, and turn the cold water off while you brush your teeth. Shaving with a running faucet\nuses about 20 gallons.\nTake showers instead of baths. The usual bath requires 36 gallons, the usual shower, only 25. Ten gallons is enough for a shower\nif you turn it off while you lather.\nDon’t use the toilet bowl to dispose of cigarette ashes, facial tissues, and other materials. A normal flush requires 5-8 gallons.\nUse dishwasher only when completely full.\nFix dripping faucets promptly. Nearly two gallons can be wasted per day of dripping.\nRunning toilets can waste four gallons per hour. Keep them in good repair.\nTHINK before you turn on the tap.\n- What does a Water Pressure Regulator cost?\nEvery water system is different.\nThe best way to determine the right regulator for your specific needs, and it’s cost, is to\ncontact us here at Suburban Water Heater Company.\nWe’ll recommend the right regulator for your application and provide a written estimate.\nTo determine how much you might saving, it would be necessary to consider the factors in question 17, in comparing with your current water and energy bills.\n- How do I know if I have high water pressure?\nA rule of thumb is: If you hear banging pipes in your home or observe water splashing in your sink,\nyou probably have excessive pressure.

PA HIC# 066680\nCopyright 2013 All Rights Reserved', 'Whether you are buying a house or your water heater is not producing hot water, water heater replacement may be on the horizon. Often, homeowners are not prepared for water heater replacement. When a water heater quits, it can become a shock to us and our wallet.\nPart of preparing and budget for a water heater replacement is knowing how long a water heater will last.\nAn electric tank water heater lasts 10 to 15 years. A gas tank water heater lasts 8 to 12 years. With routine maintenance, tank water heaters can last 20 years or more. Tank water heater repairs cost $200 to $300 while replacement costs $1500 to $2000. Tankless water heaters can last 15 to 20 years. With more functional parts that can fail, tankless water heater repair costs about $575, and replacement costs $1500 to $3000.\nDo you need a Licensed Plumber? We can help!\nGet a free estimate from top-rated, screened, and licensed plumbers in your area!\nA well-maintained gas or electric water heater can last 20 years or more. Water heater maintenance includes annual water heater flushing maintenance and replacing the anode rod every 2-3 years to protect the inner tank lining.\nIn this article, we will focus on tank-style water heaters. You can get details on how long a tankless water heater lasts here. Many factors go into determining how long a water heater will last. The number one factor in extending the life of a water heater is proper maintenance. Even inexpensive water heaters can outlast more expensive models provided it’s properly maintained.\nHowever, if the water heater is not maintained well, you can expect the lifespan to be shorter, and you could risk sudden failure or damage to your house.\nMost inexpensive water heaters come with a 6-year manufacturer warranty. However, some better quality models can have manufacturer warranties of 10 to 12 years. In contrast, a few high-end models offer lifetime warranties on the water heater.\nWater heaters with a fiberglass tank tend to last considerably longer than water heaters with steel tanks. Regardless of type, it is essential to remember that all tanks eventually fail no matter how well it’s maintained.\nCost to Repair a Tank Water Heater\nIf caught in time, most water heater repairs are relatively inexpensive and easy to do. However, this may not always be the best option. Here are some things that you should consider:\nYou should consider the repair cost and whether you can do that repair yourself or if you need to hire a licensed plumber. A plumber will cost about $50 to $150 per hour and often carries a minimum trip charge. If the water heater is experiencing a higher maintenance level, a replacement water heater will be your best option.\nThere’s no point in throwing good money after bad. If your repair cost will be 50% the cost of a new water heater and will only provide a small amount of remaining life expectancy, then replacement would be your best option.\n|Water Heater Repair||Part Cost||Repair with Labor|\n|Thermocouple||$20||$70 to $170 (1 hour)|\n|Gas Control Thermostat||$80||$130 to $210 (1 hour)|\n|Heating Elements||$40||$210 to $360 (2 hours)|\n|Electric Thermostat||$20||Included in Heating Element Replacement|\n|Leaking||Varies||Up to $1000|\nCost to Replace a Tank Water Heater\nNow that you’ve determined it’s time to replace your water heater, there are some things you need to consider:\n- Will you be replacing the water heater with a similarly sized unit? When you decided that it’s time to replace your water heater, it may be an excellent time to make an upgrade or to switch to a tankless system. If your house is damaged by a leak or needs to move the water heater, replacement is recommended.\n- Do you need a larger tank to meet your family’s needs? If your family has grown since you installed the water heater last time, a larger water heater may be desired. However, there are limitations to size when choosing tank water heaters, depending on where you live.\n- Will you install the water heater yourself or hire a licensed plumber? It is always recommended that you hire a licensed plumber to install a new water heater. Licensed plumbers in your area will know local building codes that you may not be aware of. However, depending on your skill level, you can install a new water heater yourself.\nNew Water Heater Tank and Installation Costs\nAccording to HomeDepot.com, the average cost of a new water heater installation is approximately $1,308. Nationwide costs typically range from $952 to $2,098. This replacement estimate includes the following components:\n- Traditional tank water heater – typical water heater size is 40 or 50 gallons.\n- Permits to install new water (some locations do not require this).\n- Installation materials such as fittings, shut-off valves, piping, etc.\n- Installation labor by a local, licensed, and insured plumber.\n- Removal of the old unit following local laws.\nIf you choose to purchase and install a water heater yourself, you can expect to pay between $350 to $2000 depending on the size and type of water heater you decide to purchase.\n|Water Heater Type/Size||Average Cost||Installed|\n|Electric, 40 Gallon||$400 – $450||$600 – $1050|\n|Electric, 50 Gallon||$450 – $1000||$650 – $1600|\n|Electric Hybrid, 50 Gallon||$1000 – $1500||$1200 – $2100|\n|Electric Hybrid, 80 Gallon||$1500 – $2250||$1700 – $2850|\n|Gas, 40 Gallon||$460 – $550||$660 – $1150|\n|Gas, 50 Gallon||$560 – $1200||$760 – $1800|\n|Gas, 75+ Gallon||$1400 – $1900||$1600 – $2500|\nBe Aware of Hidden Installation Costs\nWe touched on building codes and number three in the previous section. When you replace a water heater, you will be required to meet all current building codes.\nThere may be costs greater than just the water heater itself. Some of the hidden costs you may see when installing a new water heater include:\n- Expansion tanks – expansion tanks are used to help control pressure inside and water heater.\n- Seismic strapping – depending on where you live, you may need seismic strapping if you live in an area prone to earthquakes.\n- Drain pans – drain pans are placed under the water heater to catch leaks and discharge water to the exterior to protect the structure of your home.\n- Plumbing pipe upgrades – Depending on the type of plumbing supply pipes you have in your house, you may need upgrades. For example, if your home has polybutylene piping, you will likely need to replace all accessible piping during installation.\nWhy Hot Water Heaters Fail\nA water heater may seem to fail out of nowhere, but that’s not the case. Water heaters fail over time. It is recommended you drain and flush your water heater annually. It would be best to replace the anode rod every 2-3 years. This sacrificial rod protects the interior tank lining.\nYou can often predict water heater failure if you are aware of the signs. There are two main reasons why tank water heaters fail:\nToo much pressure inside the tank\nAs the water heats up, it expands, creating pressure inside the tank. If the water inside the tank heats up to the point that it exceeds the tank’s pressure specification, it could explode. One of the ways to avoid this is keeping your hot water temperature setting under 140°F.\nModern water heaters are equipped with a temperature and pressure relief valve (T&P valve). The temperature and pressure relief valve open when the pressure inside the tank reaches the tank’s temperature threshold. This valve expels hot water through a discharge pipe to relieve the pressure inside the tank.\nAnother safety feature that you can add is an expansion tank. Expansion tanks help control pressure inside the water heater tank by providing a place for hot water to expand. In a 50 gallon tank, hot water expands to 52 gallons. A 2-gallon expansion tank can store the expanded water.\nOne of the problems with old water heaters is that they lack a T&P valve and an expansion tank to help control the water heater’s pressure. With nowhere to expand, the pressure inside the tank can cause the water heater to explode, turning many old water heaters into a ticking time bomb.\nFlush Sediment Buildup Inside the Water Heater\nThe second leading cause of water heater failure is sediment buildup inside the tank. Chemicals and contaminants found in the water supply cause corrosion inside the tank, eventually rusting the tank, causing it to leak.\nExplosions occur when a flaw develops inside the tank. The tank’s pressure builds and forces water through these weak areas.\nAs part of your annual maintenance on your water heater, you should drain and flush out any sediment inside the tank. Tank water heaters have a drain valve at the base of the tank to do this. Here’s a quick rundown of how you can drain and flush your water heater.\n- Turn off the water supply before working on the water heater.\n- Turn off power or gas to the water heater before starting work.\n- Attach the hose to the drain valve and run it to the exterior to drain freely and safely. Remember the water will be hot.\n- Open hot water tap at a nearby sink.\n- Open the drain valve on the water heater to begin draining.\n- Once the water heater has drained, turn the water supply back on the flush the tank.\n- Close the drain valve once the water heater has been flushed and water running from the hose is clear.\n- Allow the water heater tank to refill.\n- Turn the power or gas back on to the water heater back. If you have a gas water heater, you’ll likely need to light the pilot.\nFor a more detailed step by step guide see, Water Heater Maintenance Tips to 2X Your Tanks Lifespan.\nReplace Your Anode Rod\nWater heaters with glass liners are equipped with an anode rod that attracts contaminants in water. Over time the contaminants will eat away at the anode rod protecting the tank’s liner. Once the anode rod has deteriorated, contaminants begin attacking the liner, weakening the water heater. You can expect anode rods to last 3-5 years, depending on the water quality and the type of anode rod installed.\nAnode rods are made from magnesium, aluminum, or aluminum/zinc alloy. Replacement anode rods can be purchased at local home improvement stores and are relatively easy to install.\nIt would help if you replaced your anode rod every 3 to 5 years. You can do this during your annual flushing maintenance of the water heater. You may want to replace a low-quality anode rod with a better quality one that will last longer.\nFor a more detailed step by step guide see, Water Heater Anode Rods: What it is & How to Replace it\nSigns You Need to Replace Your Water Heater\nAge of the Water Heater\nAge is a significant factor in your water heater’s performance. If your water heater is over ten years old, you should expect to have higher maintenance costs or to replace it in the near future.\nIf you’ve properly maintained your water heater, you may get up to 12 to15 years of life from a gas water heater and 10 to 15 years from electric water heaters. Beyond that, replacement is recommended mainly due to tank condition, rapid advances in safety, and improvements in energy efficiency.\nEnergy efficiency is crucial when it comes to gas water heaters. Energy consumption is higher in older water heaters versus newer models, which will pay for itself over time.\nRusty Water From Water Heater\nIf you see rusty or reddish-brown water from your water heater, that’s an indication that rust is mixing with water inside your tank. It’s a clear indication that your water heater needs replacement.\nIf the water heater is not leaking, you may be able to buy some time by performing a drain and flush maintenance on the water heater to remove loose sediment and change your anode rod. However, depending on the condition of the tank’s interior, this service may not be sufficient.\nUltimately, if the tank is damaged or starting to leak, there is no other option but replacement.\nGurgling Sounds Inside Your Water Heater\nAs your water heater gets older, sediment begins to build up at the bottom of the tank. When the sediment is heated and reheated over time, it begins to harden.\nBanging, crackling or gurgling sounds from inside your water heater indicates a sediment buildup inside the tank. It is recommended that you try to flush and drain your water heater. Depending on the amount of sediment build-up inside the water heater, the drain valve may be clogged or blocked, preventing it from draining water properly. One option would be to try replacing the drain valve to clear sediment from the water heater.\nIf all attempts to drain and remove the sediment fails, then replacement is the best option. In this case, the water heater’s replacement is recommended before a catastrophic leak occurs, which could cost thousands of dollars of damage to your house.\nLeaking from the Bottom of a Water Heater Tank\nIf your water heater is leaking, that is a good indication that there is something wrong. See our How to Repair a Leaking Water Heater – Complete Step by Step Guide for steps to repair a leaking water heater. You need to contact a licensed plumber to have them examine your water heater for repair or replacement.\nSome leaks can be repaired while others can’t. Leaks located around the top of the water heater, such as around the supply pipe fittings or the T&P valve, are likely repairable. However, this is not always the case and still an indication that something is going wrong internally that needs to be addressed.\nIf you’ve noticed water on the floor around your water heater, then you could have a severe problem. You can’t repair internal leaks in tanks. If water is leaking from the bottom of your tank, you should plan on an immediate replacement and call a licensed plumber.\nThe Water Heater Stops Producing Hot Water\nHot water is a daily luxury we’ve all become accustomed to. No hot water can be an inconvenience. If the electric water heater has no hot water, many things could be the cause. One is there is likely a bad heating element or a bad electric thermostat.\nAnother possibility is a broken drip tube. The drip tube is a plastic pipe that runs from the cold water inlet to the tank’s bottom. If this pipe is broken, cold water and hot water mix resulting in lukewarm water from the tank.\nThese items do commonly fail over time and can be repaired by a licensed plumber. These items are relatively easy to replace for the handy do-it-yourself person.']	['<urn:uuid:0511197a-98e9-4f85-92fa-13223af6b700>', '<urn:uuid:6bd65563-e38d-437b-9468-f0cdda09b846>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	38	97	5017
33	Are brass stair gauges used for both pocket tapes and framing squares?	No - the documents only mention brass stair gauges being used with framing squares to lock in dimensions for stair stringer layout. They are not mentioned as being used with pocket tapes.	"['Carpentry Measuring Tools\nEvery carpenter should have carpentry measuring tools to take measurements quickly and accurately. This part in carpentry must be mastered early in the carpenters training. Practice reading the measuring tape to gain skills in fast and precise measuring.\nMeasurements and Tapes. Measurements used in construction in the United States are divided into feet, inches, and usually 16ths of an inch. Most measurements and tapes used by the carpenter have clearly marked increments of 16 inches to help in laying out spaced framing members.\nSome carpenters prefer the six foot folding rule while others use the pocket ape. The folding ruler sometimes has a metal extension on one end for taking inside measurements. To help the ruler last longer oil the joints occasionally to prevent breaking the ruler when opening and closing it. Pocket tapes are available in 6-30 foot lengths. A hook on the end slides back and forth slightly to compensate for the thickness of its metals when taking outside and inside measurements.\nSteel Tapes of 50 and 100 foot lengths are commonly used to lay out longer measurements. The end of the tape has a steel ring with a folding hook attached. The hook may be unfolded to go over the edge of an object. Rewind the tape when you are not using it. If the tape is stepped on when using it may snap or become kinked. Keep it out of water. If it gets wet dry it while rewinding. This method works for all tape measures.\nCarpenters have to use several different kinds of squares to lay out for square and other angel cuts.\nA combination square consists of a movable blade that is one inch wide and 12 inches long, which slides along the body of the square. It is used to lay out or test 90 and 45 degree angels. Hold the body of the square against the edge of the stock and mark along the blade. It can be used as a depth gauge to layout or test the depth of grooves, rabbets, and dadoes. It can be used with a pencil as a marking gauge to draw lines parallel to the edge of the board. Drawing lines in this manor is called gauging lines. Be sure to check the edge of the wood for slivers as well.\nThe speed square is one of my most used and loved carpentry measuring tools in carpentry. The speed squares are made of one piece plastic and aluminum alloy and are available in two sizes. They can be used to lay 90 and 45 degree angels and as guides for portable power saws. A degree scale allows angels to be laid out, other scales may be used to lay out rafters.\nThe framing square, often called the steel square is a L shaped tool made of thin steel or aluminum. The longer of the two legs are called the blade or body and is two inches wide and 24 inches long. The shorter leg is called the tongue and it is 1 1/2 inches wide and 16 inches long. The outside corner is called the heel.\nThe framing square has been used for centuries. Entire books have been written about it based on the use of the right angel triangle, many layout techniques have been devised and used throughout the years. Although the techniques, and the scales, tables and graduations retain on the square, are now rarely used, the carpenter once depended on them.\nThe framing square is one of my favorite carpentry measuring tools as well. On most carpentry jobs carpenters use the framing square for laying out roof rafters, bridging, and stair framing laying out walls and much more.\nBasic Carpentry Measuring Tools\nHome Page for Basic Carpentry', 'This stair stringer primer will teach you how to layout your rise and run for a stair stringer including the special attention you will need to give to the bottom step and the top step. If you haven\'t read our page: Stair Layout Primer, we highly recommend that you do so before attempting this stage of stairs construction. Also, familiarize yourself with the three (3) main wooden stair types illustrated on our page Stair Types so you have a clear idea of their differences.\nIn this stair stringer primer we will be laying out the stringers for the Type 2 closed-riser stairs illustrated in Stair Layout Diagram 1 shown on our page: Stair Layout Primer. We will be using a standard 16"" x 24"" framing square like the one shown at the left, and a pair of brass stair gauges to lock-in the dimensions — once set.\nThe brass stair gauges shown at the right lock onto each leg of the framing square so that repetitive work on the stair stringers (everything between the bottom and top treads) stays uniform in measurement. You can purchase these at any Ace Hardware Store for a nominal cost if you don\'t already have a pair.\nIn this stair stringer primer we will be laying out a pair of stair stringers that have thirteen (13) treads, fourteen (14) risers, and a tread run of 9-3/4"" with a riser dimension of 7-7/8"" and a 1-1/4"" nosing at each tread. We will be working with 2 x 12 stringer material that is 14\' in length. Our material will be Southern Yellow Pine so that we can achieve the maximum structural integrity possible in the stringers — after they are cut.\nGarage Tips: We suggest that you open our page Stair Layout Primer in a new tab and scroll down to Stair Layout Diagram 1 so that you can toggle between this Stair Stringer Primer page and that page for reference as we progress. Get New Tab Here!\nThis stair stringer primer will now illustrate how to layout the bottom tread (Tread 1) with our framing square and the dimensions specified above. The diagram below shows our 2 x 12 stair stringer (setting on saw-horses) and our framing square. The framing square is set with the brass stair gauges at 7-7/8"" on the 16"" leg measured down from the upper outside corner of the framing square. This is the riser dimension we are using.\nOur tread dimension of 9-3/4"" is also set with the brass stair gauges measured over on the 24"" leg from the same outside corner. These dimensional settings establish the needed angle of 38.86° so that our risers will be plumb and our treads will be level. You will have no lumber to waste using the 14\' lengths of 2 x 12 material so you have to get right to the end of the stringer with your first pencil-lines. Also, notice the dimension of 6-3/8"". This is our 7-7/8"" riser dimension minus the thickness of the tread material of Tread 1 which is 1-1/2"".\nGarage Tips: You will notice when setting up your framing square with the brass stair gauges that due to the fact of the size and shape of the gauges, that they will not align with the measurements you are striving for on the legs of the square. Do not worry about this — the measurements on the legs of the square have to align with the edge of the wood on the stringer. That is all that is important.\nStair Stringer Primer Step 1: Cut a piece of 1 x 1 to the exact length of 6-3/8"". Make sure both ends are square by trimming one off first, then measuring and cutting to length by cutting the opposite end. Move your framing square to near the end of the stringer material and place the 1 x 1 gauge along the outside edge of the 16"" leg of the square. When you get to the point that the 1 x 1 gauge is exactly aligned with the stringer line at the top and the end remove the gauge and make a pencil-line along the framing square blade. Slide the framing square out of the way and check the length of the line with your tape measure to make sure it is exactly 6-3/8"".\nStair Stringer Primer Step 2: Now, remove the brass stair gauges from your framing square and align the short leg of the square with 6-3/8"" pencil-line you drew onto the stringer in Step 1. Get the upper corner of the square right up to the top of the line and draw another pencil line along the 24"" leg of the square exactly 9-3/4"" long. You can use the ruler along the top of the 24"" leg for this. You will now have two (2) pencil-lines on your stringer — the bottom riser and the bottom tread (Tread 1).\nStair Stringer Primer Step 3: Now you need to establish the floor line where the stringer will meet the lower of the two floors. Remove the brass stair gauges from your framing square and align the short leg with the 6-3/8"" line drawn in Step 1. Then, draw a pencil-line along the entire distance of the bottom of the 24"" leg of the square. This will establish the lower floor line where the stringer will rest. Once you have this step completed, the remainder of the steps will go fairly quick.\nGarage Tips: You now have your first tread (Tread 1), riser, and lower floor line bearing point pencil-lined onto one stringer. It is a good idea at this time to repeat this entire process now onto your second stringer. In this stair stringer primer, we presume that you are a ""newbie"" to this ancient technology so there are a few added steps being taken for precautionary purposes that a seasoned professional would not execute. These extra steps are for educational purposes to help you understand the procedures more thoroughly.\nStair Stringer Primer Step 4: Now, adjust your framing square as shown in the illustration at the left so that the 16"" leg aligns with the ends of the tread and floor lines to re-establish your angle. These lines should both be exactly 9-3/4"" inches long. Simultaneously align the outside corner of the square with the upper edge of the stringer material and lock your brass stair guides into place as shown on both legs of the framing square. Then, mark the next riser line and tread line as shown in the illustration. Make sure the tread line is exactly 9-3/4"" long using the ruler along the top leg of the framing square.\nStair Stringer Primer Step 5: Now continue sliding your framing square along the bottom edge of the stair stringers and pencil-mark each riser and tread as you go with their appropriate number as shown on the illustration at the left. Continue this until you get all the way to Tread 13 and pencil-mark the lines for that tread. The next step will be a little more complicated and will depend upon how you plan to attach your stringers to the next floor. In some cases. carpenters will run a 2 x 6 between the stringers at the top, bolting it to the floor-joist with the stringers end nailed into the 2 x 6. Others will use a more complex approach of cutting the stringer around the floor-joist(s) and anchoring them in from behind. We will illustrate that approach next. Keep in mind that you may need longer lengths of stringer material for the more complex approach.\nStair Stringer Primer Step 6: This step is a bit more complicated as you are going to fit your stair stringers up under the backside of the second floor joists for a solid attachment to the second floor. Basically, what you need to do is measure the existing conditions of your stair opening where the stringers attach and scribe those conditions onto the stringers for cutout purposes. Since you will run-out of stringer material you will have to scribe parallel line-work onto the stringers using your framing square without the brass stair guides attached. Make sure all line work is parallel to the tread and riser lines, and you will likely be fine.\nTake your time in measuring the existing conditions and make a sketch of what you will be scribing onto the stringers showing your measured dimensions for each turn and meeting point. Where your stringers tuck-up behind the existing floor-joists you can run a 2 x 4 or 2 x 6 between them that will abut the existing floor-joists and then run lag bolts through into the floor-joists to secure the stringers at this end of the staircase. The stringers will have to have the 2 x 4 or 2 x 6 attached to them before the final installation. You should screw each stringer to the end of the 2 x 4 or 2 x 6 with 4"" long wood screws. You will have to get an exact measurement of how long the 2 x 4 or 2 x 6 needs to be minus the thickness of the stringers to make this work properly, based upon existing conditions.\nYou should use the same approach between the stringers at the floor line under Tread 1. Place a 2 x 4 or 2 x 6 between each stringer that can be attached to the first floor. If that floor is concrete, then use concrete anchors to make the attachment. You should also put construction adhesive (PL400) under the 2 x 4 or 2 x 6 before setting the bolts into the concrete anchors.\nGarage Tips: One thing we would like to recommend in this stair stringer primer is that before attempting these layouts on expensive structural materials (2 x 12 Southern Yellow Pine), you attempt a dry-run on inexpensive 1 x 12 - #3 Common Pine to make sure you have all of your calculations right and your layout accurate. You can cut the 1 x 12 at each end without cutting-out all of the treads and risers, for a test fit. Once you have it in place in the stairwell, you can check the tread and riser lines to make sure they are level and plumb.\nStair Stringer Diagram 1 above illustrates what your stair stringer layout should look like after you have finished laying out all pencil-lines for the conditions of your project. As you can see, it barely fits onto a 14\' long 2 x 12 piece of structural lumber.\nDepending upon your own conditions and the rise dimension and number of treads, you will have to decide if you may need to utilize 16"" long stringer material. The conditions for your project may dictate this based on how the staircase will be supported.\nIf you have two adjoining walls along the staircase, you can attach the stringers to the studs with wood screws. In that case, 14\' stringer material will probably be more than enough. Also, you can eliminate all of the extra cut-work at Tread 13 and simply pencil-line the back of that tread-riser, downward toward the bottom of the stringer.\nAs you can see in this Stair Stringer Primer article, this is a somewhat complex subject to deal with. Your editors experience has been that once you grasp the basic concept of how this works with the framing square, the rest becomes easier as you progress with your project.\nNext, study our page Staircase Assembly to learn the basics of how to assemble the risers and treads onto the stair stringers.\n❖ Testimonials ❖\nWe have been following your blog and we have found a lot of useful information in it.\nDorman Products, Inc.\nI was pleased that I was able to easily find the proper tall storage cabinet for my garage.

34	Why do ships get stuck near the equator and what causes the heavy rain there?	Ships historically got stuck near the equator in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) due to the relatively calm surface winds in this region - this is actually the origin of the phrase 'feeling down in the doldrums.' The heavy rain in this area occurs because the trade winds from both hemispheres collide and are forced upward, along with air that rises due to heating from the ocean. As this moisture-laden air rises and cools, the water vapor condenses, resulting in heavy precipitation. This process also releases heat that drives regional and global atmospheric circulation.	"['The Intertropical convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a narrow band where the trade winds of the two hemispheres collide. At or near the ITCZ, sea-surface temperature (SST) is at a maximum. As the winds travel over the tropical water, they pick up moisture; where they collide, they are driven upward. The air is also forced upward by convection resulting from heating by the ocean. As the air rises, it cools, the moisture condenses, and heavy rain results. The heat released drives the regional and global atmospheric circulation. It also makes the ITCZ an origin site for cyclones. Another effect of the upward movement of air is relatively calm surface winds. This causes the ITCZ to be an area of downwelling, and, thus, low nutrients and productivity. The ITCZ interacts with other climatological features, affecting weather and climate in the tropics and subtropics.\nThe ITCZ might be expected to fall directly on the equator, because, on average, this is where the Sun is strongest. In actuality, the ITCZ moves, but tends to fall preferentially in the northern hemisphere, over the eastern Pacific and the Atlantic oceans. The shift can be 10 degrees or more in latitude, or several hundred mi. (km.), and it has significant effects.\nThe cause appears to be related to the western boundaries of South America and Africa, particularly the northwest to southeast slopes of the boundaries at the equator. This weakens the northeasterly trade winds, thereby warming the water north of the equator and allowing southeasterlies to cross into the north prior to convergence.\nThe easterly trade winds are the prevalent winds in the tropical Pacific and Atlantic oceans. These winds push the warm surface water west, exposing cooler water, known as the Equatorial Cold Tongue. Stronger trade winds in the south favor upwelling below the equator. Low-level stratus clouds above the cold water and evaporative cooling aided by the winds reinforce the hemispheric temperature difference and move it westward. The Sun is closest to the Earth during northern winter, which may also favor prevalence of a northern ITCZ. The dominance of monsoons over trade winds in the Indian Ocean maintains equatorial symmetry there.\nThe ITCZ fluctuates over many timescales. Local winds are important seasonally, more distant winds can be significant interannually, and ocean circulation can affect sea-surface temperatures on decadal or greater scales. Normal annual migration is from 10 degrees north latitude in August to 3 degrees north in February. In March and April, a double ITCZ above and below the equator can form. Weak trade winds and subsequent decreased upwelling in El Nino years may move the ITCZ south of the equator in the Pacific.\nThe asymmetry of the ITCZ aids in establishing an annual, rather than a biannual, weather cycle in the tropical eastern and central Pacific Ocean, even though the sun crosses the equator twice yearly. Seasonal air temperatures there exhibit wide divergence because the seasonal weakening and strengthening of the south-easterlies reduce or enhance upwelling and evaporative cooling. Models indicate that this phenomenon could intensify in response to increased greenhouse gases. Interannual and decadal variation in the ITCZ can result in droughts in some years, and floods in others. Southward displacement is associated with increased the occurrence and intensity of El Nino, while El Nino is suppressed by northward displacement.\nThe southward shift brings dry conditions to South America and perhaps western Africa, and increased rain in eastern Africa. Warming in one hemisphere or cooling in the other moves the ITCZ in the direction of warming. Past deflection of the ITCZ likely resulted from orbital changes that affected how the sun strikes Earth. Prolonged shifts have been linked to changes in human society, because of their effects on precipitation. The Northern Hemisphere is currently experience greater warming than the Southern Hemisphere because of the greater ocean heat sink in the south. This raises the possibility of change in the El Nino/ Southern Oscillation regime. Changes in the Atlantic Meridional Circulation could also reorganize heat distribution, thereby evoking a response in the ITCZ.', ""The sun’s energy does not fall evenly onto our spherical planet: some parts of the earth (b on image 1) are pointing directly at the sun, therefore the sun’s energy has less distance to travel to reach the surface and is focused over a small surface area; whereas other parts (a on image 1) point away from the sun, therefore the same amount of sunlight has further to travel (which allows more solar energy to be deflected back into space by particles in the atmosphere) and is spread over a larger region. The amount of solar energy an area gets over a period of time is known as insolation. As a result, the Equator and the Tropics are much warmer as they receive more insolation, with temperature decreasing towards the Poles as insolation decreases.\nThis difference in solar input generates major global patterns of atmospheric circulation: air that is strongly heated at the equator has the greatest tendency to rise. If we were on a planet which didn’t rotate, this would result in one large circulation ‘cell’ – one in which warm air would rise at the equator, move to the colder polar regions, sink and flow back to replace the air at the equator (image 2a).\nImage 2: Global atmospheric circulation cells a) without the Earth’s rotation b) with the Earth’s rotation (Images from www.ux1.eiu.edu/~cfjps/1400/circulation.html)\nHowever, since our planet does rotate. If you imagine standing on the equator, over the course of a day you cover a large distance (about 24,874 miles), whereas if you were standing at the poles, you wouldn’t move any distance, but simply rotate on the spot. You don’t ‘feel’ the speed you are moving as the air is moving at the same rate. Therefore, air at the equator moves much faster than air at the poles, so as it rises and moves towards the poles, it is moving faster than the underlying ground. So it seems as though the air overtakes the ground and moves from west to east; in contrast, as air is pulled from the poles towards the tropics, it is moving more slowly than the underlying earth, so it looks like it is moving east to west. In short, nothing in the atmosphere moves in a straight line: everything in the northern hemisphere is deflected to the right. This is known as the Coriolis Effect.\nAs a result, the Earth’s atmosphere contains six rotating cells of air (three in the northern hemisphere, and three in the southern hemisphere) which engulf the earth like giant ‘air doughnuts’ (image 2b and 3):\nThe Hadley Cell: This is driven by warm air rising. This Coriolis Effect causes the air that has risen at the equator and moving to the poles to deflect and become increasingly westerly high up in the atmosphere that the circulation breaks down and the air sinks back towards the ground in the sub tropics (30° – the ‘horse latitudes’). Once the air has descended back to the ground, it returns to the equator and is deflected to the east – they are known as the easterly trade winds.\nPolar Cell: The same thing happens in the polar regions, but it is driven by cold air sinking; the sinking, cold air at the poles moves back towards the equator, but because it is slow moving it becomes increasingly easterly as the underlying earth moves faster, and the circulation eventually breaks down at around 70° latitude. The air then rises again and returns to the poles, resulting in another atmospheric cell.\nFerrel Cell: This lies in between the Polar and Hadley cell, and is a little more complicated. Put simply, it is the net effect of air motions from all the storms or ‘depressions’ that occur in the mid-latitudes. Air sinks in the sub tropics and rises around 60-70°. In this region, westerly surface winds occur. This drives most of the weather systems we experience here in the UK, with weather moving off the Atlantic (see Box 1 below).\nThese drive air flow, atmospheric pressure (weight of the air pressing down on the earth) and rainfall. The rising and sinking of air causes high and low pressure at the surface, respectively: A low pressure belt is found around the equator – known as the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)*, where the northern and southern trade winds meet. In the images in this article, this is positioned precisely at the equator. However, since the earth tilts on its axis, the Earth is only overhead at the equator twice a year, at the equinox. Throughout the rest of the year, the precise location of the ITCZ changes: it moves north to the Tropic of Cancer (20° N) during the UK summer and south to the Tropic of Capricorn (20° S) in the UK winter (see Box 2 below).\nTwo more low pressure regions are found at around 60° north and south of the equator, known as subpolar lows, which lie between the polar cell and the Ferrel cell, where air ascends. As air rises, pressure falls and the air cools. As cooler air can hold less moisture, condensation occurs. Therefore in these regions clouds form and precipitation is likely to develop.\nConversely, where air sinks, pressure increases and areas of high pressure develop resulting in clear skies, with no cloud formation and therefore less rainfall. Subtropical high pressure is found at 30° north and south of the equator, as air sinks between the Hadley and Ferrel cell. Once this dry air reaches the surface it starts to pick up moisture from the surface, resulting in bands of deserts at 30° and dry regions at the north and south poles.\nThe interactive effect of the three circulation cells (Hadley, Ferrel and Polar), combined with the influence of the Coriolis effect results in the global circulation. The net effect is to transfer energy from the tropics towards the poles in a gigantic conveyor belt.\n*When crossing the equator, sailors in the 1700s would get boats stuck for weeks due to lack of wind in the ITCZ, so the expression ‘feeling down in the doldrums’ (meaning a person is depressed or lacking energy) is believed to be derived from this.\nBOX 1: Global circulation and UK weather\nIn the northern hemisphere, warm moist air from the tropics moves northwards by the surface winds of the Ferrel cell. This meets cool, dry air moving south in the Polar cell. The polar front forms where these two air masses meet, leading to ascending air and low pressure at the surface, often around the latitude of the UK.\nThe polar front jet stream drives this area of unstable atmosphere. The UK and many other countries in Europe often experience unsettled weather due to these wandering areas of low pressure which form when moist air rises along the polar front. The jet stream guides these systems, so its position is important for UK weather (see tWC article on jet streams)\nBOX 2: ITCZ and Monsoons\nAs the ITCZ changes location during the year, the location of wet monsoon weather also changes. In the summer, air over land is heated more than air over ocean. This is because the sun’s energy is absorbed and re-emitted back into the atmosphere over land, whereas over oceans energy can be mixed to lower depths and stored. This shifts the ITCZ toward land regions, namely Asia and Australia which lie north and south of the equator, respectively.\nDuring December and January, the Southern Hemisphere is heated more strongly by the sun than the Northern Hemisphere, so the ITCZ is found just south of the equator. Winds from the Northern Hemisphere blow across the equator towards the ITCZ, picking up moisture as they move over the warm tropical ocean towards northern Australia. Meanwhile, in India, dry air descending over land resulting in little precipitation.\nHere is an accompanying lesson produced for the Society's educational website, www.MetLink.org - it also contains some ideas for experiments and demonstrations to help explain some of the concepts covered:""]"	['<urn:uuid:477b5dc9-db5e-418f-babe-051706db902c>', '<urn:uuid:11962927-58e7-43d7-a72c-a86aa4fddd45>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	15	94	2005
35	astm d1193 ultrapure water specifications requirements	According to ASTM Specification D1193, analytical-grade ultrapure water must be freshly drawn and used within 8 hours of production. The specification requires dissolved total organic carbon (TOC) to be less than 50 ppb, and microbiological contamination to be less than 10 colony-forming units per liter.	['Food analysis laboratory needs for purified water tend to be modest in quantity but demanding in quality. Food analytical methods call for two general water quality grades, pure and ultrapure. To meet purified water needs, cost-conscious laboratories consuming up to 15 liters of water per day must choose from among several options:\nExplore this issueJune/July 2005\n- Purchasing and maintaining separate purification systems for each grade of water used;\n- Acquiring a single, ultrapure water system and absorb the capital and maintenance costs of producing very high-quality water for less-than-critical applications;\n- Buying bottled water that roughly corresponds to pure and ultrapure standards;\n- Obtaining an all-purpose water system that supplies water on demand at the appropriate purity level for every assay.\nThe decision ultimately is based on quality, convenience and cost. Generally, small in size, food laboratories often combine R&D with quality-related work. The assays lab techs conduct can include quality testing of raw materials and finished products. The goal is to determine food safety requirements, nutritional analysis, quality assurance/quality control and product development.\nWater quality needs to be considered for optimal results. Operations requiring purified water include most analytical methods (titration, HPLC, ion analysis, colorimetric assays), microbiological tests, quality control, growth media, washing and rinses, column analytical and preparative chromatography, etc.\nThe two major classes of laboratory water as pure and ultrapure. Pure water has been distilled, deionized or treated by reverse osmosis. It is used in non-critical applications, where detection limits are high or in situations in which contaminants from water purity fall well within the error limits of the method used.\nUltrapure water takes pure water and adds purification steps that kill adventitious pathogens as well as removes trace ions and organics. Not every application that calls for ultrapure water demands removal of all remaining contaminants up to ultrapure standards. Specific analytical methods may only require depletion of certain ions, bacterial products or organics.\nThe need to remove organic contaminants is the most common reason for specifying ultrapure water. Organics interfere with analytical HPLC by altering peak resolution and integration, introducing ghost peaks, and affecting stationary phase chemical selectivity. About 70 and 80 percent of HPLC performance problems are directly attributable to water quality. For analytical HPLC, organic contaminants easily can achieve on-column concentrations equal to those of target analytes. In preparative chromatography, organics may concentrate on columns and co-elute with product.\nAnalytical-grade ultrapure water should comply with ASTM Specification D1193, which stipulates that water be freshly drawn and used within 8 hours of production. ASTM D1193 also specifies acceptable levels for dissolved total organic carbon (TOC) at less than 50 ppb, and microbiological contamination to less than 10 colony-forming units per liter.\nStandards for ultrapure water are significantly higher than for pure water, specifically with respect to removal of organic contaminants, which include free-standing hydrocarbons, halogenated organics, detergents and bacterial products.\nUltraviolet-mediated photo-oxidation is the most efficient, cost-effective means of achieving removal of environmental and pathogen-related organics. UV photo-oxidation employs a dual-wavelength, low-pressure mercury UV lamp in quartz sleeves and dual-wavelength (185 and 254 nm) irradiation. This wavelength combination generates hydroxyl radicals from dissolved oxygen and water. Hydroxyl and secondary free radicals react with and break up small organic molecules, the end products of which are water and CO2.\nBottled water is perhaps the least cost-effective solution. Ultrapure HPLC-grade bottled water costs close to $20 per liter – far higher than the cost of water produced by an ultrapure water system.\nA jug of distilled water costs between $1 to $2.50 per gallon in supermarkets and pharmacies. While this water is certainly of very high quality for ordinary household chores, using it in a laboratory setting is not advisable. It’s impossible to determine the pedigree of bottled water that is not reagent grade. Plastic containers used to store jug water may leach chemicals into water. And once the bottle is opened all bets are off since water absorbs gases and chemicals present in laboratory air.']	['<urn:uuid:baec81c8-0e60-40c1-90ac-278f372823ca>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	6	45	660
36	How extensive was the Census of Marine Life project?	The Census of Marine Life was a US$650 million project involving 2,700 scientists from 80 countries who conducted more than 540 expeditions over a decade. They identified over a million ocean species, with less than a quarter described in scientific literature. The project resulted in 16,000 species being added to databases and generated 2,600 scientific papers.	"[""Loriciferans can live their entire lives hidden in sediment on the seafloor without oxygen (Image: Roberto Danovaro/COML)\nStudy identifies more than 1 million ocean species\nAlok Jha, Guardian science and environment correspondent\n5th October, 2010\nThe Census of Marine Life is finally complete after a decade of work by 2,700 scientists from 80 countries\nIt is the culmination of a decade of work by 2,700 scientists from 80 countries, who went on more than 540 expeditions into the farthest reaches of the most mysterious realm on the planet – the world's oceans.\nToday, the US$650 million Census of Marine Life (COML) project announced the culmination of its work, concluding that the deep is home to more than a million species – of which less than a quarter are described in the scientific literature.\nSince the project started in 2000, around 16,000 species have been added to the COML databases and more than 5,000 are still being worked on by scientists. In total, around 2,600 scientific papers have been published as part of the project.\nJesse Ausubel, environmental scientist at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and co-founder of the COML project said that the results had far exceeded any vision he had started with.\n'On the one hand we feel like the people in London and Paris who, 250 years ago, were creating the first dictionaries and encyclopaedias. In 2000, there was a chaos with regards the information about marine life. Now we have a valid list of species, 201,000 as of yesterday. 90,000 of these species have web pages in the Encyclopaedia of Life. 35,000 of these have DNA sequences. It's not your grandfather's census: this census is this wonderful, living, interactive set of databases on the internet with hyperlinks to images, sounds, the ability to create maps.'\nThe COML will form a baseline against which scientists will be able to monitor biodiversity changes as they are affected by a range of environmental factors. 'We live in a world of very rapid change,' said Ausubel. 'Increasing illumination and sound in the ocean, the removal of sea life, acidification, changes in temperature and currents. We want to monitor and evaluate the effects of these and other activities. We can't do any of these in the absence of baselines. We hope what the census has done is create the first baseline and create a framework in which it is easy to add more information about marine plants or other newly-discovered animals.'\nTo mark the end of the COML project, scientists at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) showed off the results of the Census of Antarctic Marine Life, an inventory of more than 16,000 marine species and the culmination of more than 19 trips into Antarctic waters.\nHuw Griffiths, a marine biologist at the BAS said that identifying new species sometimes required specialist techniques. With the help of a team from New Zealand, BAS identified a a new species of amphipod crustacean, which looks a bit like a shrimp. 'Natural variation in the shape and colour of this creature makes it difficult to tell if the ones we found were the same type of species, or not. Using DNA barcoding it was possible to identify this animal as a different species that was new to science.'\nUnderstanding what lives in the Southern Ocean has helped scientists to identify a benchmark against which they can measure the effects of climate change, he added. 'The marine life we study in Antarctica is, naturally, vulnerable to these effects including warming sea surface temperatures, rising ocean acidification and decreasing winter sea ice. But we've also seen just how resilient some of these creatures can be, surviving and thriving in some of the most challenging conditions on the planet.'\nDespite a decade of work and 9,000 days at sea, however, there is much still to be done. COML scientists estimate that 10 per cent of the species in European oceans have yet to be described. Around South Africa that figure is 38 per cent, in Antarctica it is 39 to 58 per cent, for Japan it is 70 per cent, the Mediterranean deep-sea 75 per cent and Australia 80 per cent.\nIan Poiner, chair of the COML steering committee, said: 'All surface life depends on life inside and beneath the oceans. Sea life provides half of our oxygen and a lot of our food and regulates climate. We are all citizens of the sea. And while much remains unknown, including at least 750,000 undiscovered species and their roles, we are better acquainted now with our fellow travellers and their vast habitat on this globe.'\nCensus of Marine Life (COML) project\nThis article is reproduced courtesy of the Guardian Environment Network\nSeagrass may be 'uncharismatic' but it still needs protecting\nIt may be not be as visible as tropical rainforests or wetlands but seagrass plays a vital role in the global ecosystem, says Richard Unsworth, filtering pollution and providing food to fish\nSuffocating seas: how climate change is reducing ocean oxygen levels\nThe main impacts of climate change - changing weather patterns, melting glaciers, sea level rise - are well known.

37	How does the AsyncRAT malware establish persistence on infected systems through scheduled tasks?	The malware establishes persistence through a PowerShell script that creates and immediately executes a new Scheduled Task named 'Office'. This task is set to repeat every two minutes.	['Ongoing malware distribution campaigns spread AsyncRAT, including the 3LOSH crypter across public repositories. Recent cybersecurity research analyzes the latest version of 3LOSH that is being used by adversaries to evade detection on devices in corporate environments. Besides AsyncRAT, a number of other commodity malware strains can be distributed by the same operator. The purpose of this spike in the use of crypters is to increase the operational effectiveness of RAT and, as a result, exfiltrate sensitive data.\nSecurity analysts warn organizations that cyber-attacks may be leveraged by various threat actors, while the complexity of tools like the 3LOSH crypter is being continuously updated and improved. See our newest detections below which help to spot the latest activity of the 3LOSH crypter.\nThe novel Sigma-based detection rule written by our prolific Threat Bounty Developer Kyaw Pyiyt Htet recognizes possible 3LOSH execution based on the availability of certain malicious files:\nSuspicious 3LOSH (AsyncRAT) RAT Execution by Detection of Malicious Files (file_event)\nThis rule can be automatically converted to the following security solutions: Microsoft Sentinel, Chronicle Security, Elastic Stack, Splunk, Sumo Logic, ArcSight, QRadar, Humio, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Devo, FireEye, Carbon Black, LogPoint, Graylog, Regex Grep, Microsoft PowerShell, RSA NetWitness, Apache Kafka ksqlDB, Qualys, AWS OpenSearch.\nThe Sigma rule is mapped to the latest MITRE ATT&CK® version, addressing the Execution tactic and Command and Scripting Interpreter technique (T1059).\nSince AsyncRAT and 3LOSH in their older versions were spotted by threat intelligence specialists before, you can avail of our previous detections and see if there is anything else you should add to your threat hunting routine. If you have your own exclusive approach to detecting cyber threats and strive to share your expertise with the world, you’re highly welcome to join our crowdsourcing initiative.\nView Detections Join Threat Bounty\nA multi-stage infection process leveraged by AsyncRAT starts with VBScript code that is executed from an ISO file. The VBS uses junk data in its contents to obfuscate the code it executes with the help of string replacement. After deobfuscation of the code, this VBS contacts a C&C server to retrieve a PowerShell script for enabling the next stages of RAT execution.\nDuring these stages, the malware might choose various directory locations and use various file names which are, nevertheless, functionally equivalent. Ultimately, the script scans the victim’s system, then creates a working directory for the malware in a certain location that resembles something common like C:\\ProgramData\\Facebook\\System32\\Microsoft\\SystemData.\nAfter that, additional scripts are created, triggering the execution of the “Office.vbs” file and moving on to the next step of the infection process. Most of the RAT’s objectives are performed in this third stage. For example, to establish persistence, another PowerShell script creates and immediately executes a new Scheduled Task with the name “Office” and repeats it every two minutes. The final payload may vary, yet most of the analyzed samples were AsyncRAT and LimeRAT.\nResearchers conclude that 3LOSH crypter is a malware crypter that is currently under active development, being spread embedded in different commodity RATs. So the effective detection strategy should include the ability to spot the crypter independent of final payloads. Join SOC Prime’s Detection as Code platform to continuously stay updated on the new detection content and keep abreast of the current threats.']	['<urn:uuid:f114c711-24dd-46a6-883b-ce7facc8a5ac>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	13	28	541

In contrast, hummingbirds have a very different nesting situation - they lay just two eggs, and the female must handle all parental duties alone, including building the nest, incubating eggs, and feeding the young without any help from the male. The hummingbird's high metabolism limits it to caring for only two young, as feeding more would be impossible.	"[""This is a roadrunner.

In honor of the upcoming Easter holiday, I thought I’d devote this week’s column to some “egg-citing” egg trivia. I’ll try to avoid any additional “egg-sasperating” puns.\nOf course, the familiar Easter egg has traditionally been provided by chickens, although the eggs of other birds, such as ducks, geese and turkeys, are occasionally incorporated into such festivities as egg fights and egg hunts.\nProducing eggs encased in a thin calcium shell is one of the ways that the birds are different from other lifeforms. For example, mammals carry their eggs inside the body with the exception of the oddball echidnas and the platypus. Amphibians lay eggs, but their eggs are soft and must usually be deposited in the water to ensure they do not dry out. Insects also lay eggs. It’s only the birds, however, and a few reptiles that have evolved the hard-shelled egg as a more durable means of reproduction.\nThe shape and size of those eggs varied greatly. Among the world’s 10,000 species of birds, the ostrich lays the largest eggs of any bird. Closer to home, the California condor almost certainly lays the largest eggs of any U.S. bird species. According to the website, All About Birds, eggs of the California Condor eggs are about 4.5 inches long and almost 3 inches wide. These whopper eggs weigh about 11 ounces. By contrast, a large chicken eggs weighs only two ounces.\nThe eggs produced for one nesting attempt are referred to as a clutch. The number of eggs per clutch varies among different species. Among songbirds, some rather small birds lay large clutches of eggs. For instance, the kinglets, which are tiny birds barely bigger than hummingbirds, are champion egg layers. The ruby-crowned kinglet can lay as many as a dozen eggs in a clutch, while the golden-crowned kinglet may lay as many as 11 eggs per clutch. The house wren, which is also a rather diminutive bird, can lay as many as 10 eggs. Several North American wrens produce large clutches of eggs. The marsh wren and sedge wren are known to lay as many as 10 eggs per clutch. The winter wren is almost their equal with clutch sizes that can include nine eggs. Of course, these same birds may lay more average clutches of between three and six eggs.\nThe sora, a small, secretive species of rail, lays 10 to 12 eggs in a nest well-concealed in marsh vegetation. The sora has been known to produce exceptional clutches with as many as 18 eggs.\nWaterfowl are known to be good egg layers. The mallard hen may lay a clutch of eight to 13 eggs. The redhead hen typically lays only seven to eight eggs, but has parasitic tendencies that include depositing some eggs in the nests of other redheads. On occasion, multiple redhead hens get a little compulsive about slipping their eggs into a communal “dump” nest. These type of nests have been found containing as many as 80 or more eggs, but such clutches are impossible for a single hen to incubate and the eggs are usually lost. The wood duck, which will nest in specially designed bird houses placed near a source of water, can lay as many as 14 eggs in a single clutch.\nOther birds concentrate their efforts on laying only a single egg or perhaps a pair of eggs. Many species of albatross lay only a single egg. The parents will dedicate a long period incubating the egg and then tend to the needs of the solitary offspring once the egg hatches.\nHummingbirds typically lay a pair of eggs. The poor female is soon abandoned by her mate and must build a nest, incubate her two eggs, and care and feed her young without any paternal assistance whatsoever. Hummingbirds, having high metabolisms, would find it impossible to feed themselves and any more than two young in a nest.\nPenguins lay only a few eggs. Many species lay a pair of eggs, but the king penguin and emperor penguin are single-egg producers. In their harsh environment, these penguins would find meeting the needs of more than one offspring at a time quite impossible.\nLet’s talk color. Eggs come in a variety of colors. Some eggshells also feature intricate patterns and splotches.\nThe killdeer, which usually lays four eggs, produces buff-colored eggs with dark mottling on the shell. These eggs blend remarkably with gravel and other rocks, which helps the ground-nesting killdeer hide their nests from would-be predators.\nThe American robin is famous for producing a clutch of beautiful blue eggs. The coloration of the eggs have even given rise to the descriptive phrase “robin’s egg blue.” This particular shade of blue is described as a variable one that leans to greenish-blue that is paler than turquoise and more blue than aqua.\nThe American robin’s blue eggs are not unusual among the thrushes, the group of birds of which the robin can claim kinship. For instance, the Eastern bluebird’s eggs are pale blue or sometimes white. The wood thrush produces eggs that are more to the turquoise shade of blue while the veery’s eggs can vary between green and pale blue.\nThe blue tint to the eggs of robins and other thrushes is caused by a pigment that gets applied to the shell as the female lays the eggs. It’s like the female robin has an internal egg-dyeing mechanism. In an article published in May of 2012, Science Daily reported that a study conducted by Queen’s University also found that the brighter blue the egg, the more the male robin will apply himself to caring for his offspring.\nAmong the birds that use my birdhouses for nesting, I’ve always thought the eggs of Carolina chickadees are exquisite. The eggs are pale white with a hint of pinkish coloration. A fine mottling of brown spots dot the shell. The amount of mottling can vary from egg to egg in the same clutch. These tiny eggs produced by a tiny bird are kept safe and sound in a nest of moss and other plant materials with a soft lining of animal hairs. Chickadees lay between three and 10 eggs, but between five and eight eggs per clutch seems more usual.\nAs mentioned, the ostrich lays the largest egg. Ostrich clutches are also impressive. The wild African ostrich, the largest bird in the world, lays 12 to 18 eggs. The ostrich has been domesticated, however, and hens have been conditioned to produce more eggs than would ever be expected in the wild.\nThe ostrich belongs to the ratite family, which includes other large birds such as the emu, rhea and cassowary, as well as five species of kiwi, which are considerably smaller than other ratites. The kiwi does have one interesting claim to fame when it comes to eggs. Kiwi are notable for laying eggs that are extremely large in relation to their body size. A kiwi egg may equal 15 to 20 percent of the body mass of a female kiwi. Perhaps not surprisingly, most kiwis lay only a single egg per clutch. The brown kiwi, however, normally lays two eggs per clutch.\nAepyornis, which was a giant, flightless ratite native to Madagascar and now extinct, produced the largest egg of any bird. Also known as the elephant bird, Aepyornis produced an egg with a volume equal to slightly more than 150 chicken eggs. These giant eggs boasted a circumference of 3 feet, 3 inches and reached about 13 inches in length. Research indicates that humans drove these enormous birds into extinction. One theory is that humans feasted so heavily on the giant eggs produced by Aepyornis that the birds were unable to sustain their species.\nHumans have long turned to eggs as a source of nourishment, but we do not feed exclusively on eggs. Animals that feed primarily on eggs are classified by experts as ovivores. Some ovivores include fish, snakes, insects and, yes, birds. Some birds have become quite adept at preying on the eggs of other birds. Blue jays and American crows are known for robbing nests for both eggs and nestlings of other birds.\nThe bird egg has become firmly interwoven into human culture and traditions. According to the website Aghires.com, estimates indicate that about 180 million eggs are purchased each year in the United States specifically for the Easter holiday. Chicken hens must feel really overworked at this time of the year.\nOf course, there are also the Easter traditions of chocolate and peanut butter eggs. I suppose that eases the pressure slightly on the overworked hens.\nI’m reminding readers that I want to hear from them when they see their first hummingbird of spring. Email me your observations at firstname.lastname@example.org or post them on my Facebook page at http://www.facebook.com/ahoodedwarbler. Please include the date and the approximate time of your sighting.\nObservations will be accepted through Sunday, April 18.

39	How does geography affect current economic performance?	Geography has both direct and indirect effects on economic performance. While there is debate about whether geography or institutions have the more important direct effect, there is consensus that geography indirectly affects economic performance through its influence on the origin of institutions.	['There is a heated ongoing debate in the field of long term economic development on whether it is geography or ‘institutions’ that has the more important direct effect on current economic performance. However, one area of consensus in this debate is that geography has an indirect effect on economic performance through its influence on the origin of institutions. This consensus provides the motivation for a branch of the literature that seeks the geographic origins of economic institutions in the very long run.\nThis literature concentrates on the geographic and biogeographic endowments conducive to the onset and diffusion of economic development over the past millennia. Its starting point is the Neolithic revolution (approx. 10,000 B.C.), that is, the transition from hunter-gathering to agriculture and domestication, which led in turn to higher population density, more complex social and economic systems, and the emergence of the state above the tribal level. The conventional explanation for this deep technological and social change maintains that environmental advantages were instrumental in bringing about the increase of agricultural productivity relative to foraging. This, combined with the ability to store food, facilitated population agglomeration and the emergence of a non-food producing elite as well as the creation of rudimentary states to oversee the provision of defense. Although empirical research has found evidence that supports this theory, recent research presents interesting challenges to the received wisdom. A competing theory argues, for example, that the origin of a non-food producing elite and the emergence of more complex social institutions did not depend on the availability of food surplus but was instead a result of the appropriability of cereal crops from farmers.\nBockstette, Valerie, Areendam Chanda and Louis Putterman (2002). “States and Markets: The Advantage of an Early Start.” Journal of Economic Growth, 7(4): 347-69.

40	agricultural products exchanged ancient silk road china central asia	Along the ancient Silk Road, flax, pomegranate, alfalfa, and grape were brought to China, while Chinese products like well digging technology, silk, and tea were exported to Central Asia and beyond.	"['Vision and Action on\nJointly Promoting Agricultural Cooperation\non the Belt and Road\nMinistry of Agriculture, P. R. China\nNational Development and Reform Commission, P. R. China\nMinistry of Commerce, P. R. China\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, P. R. China\nSince the world entered the 21stcentury, the pace for economic integration has quickened, giving rise to a new era of peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit. In September and October of 2013, President Xi Jinping P. R. China proposed the initiative of jointly building the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21stCentury Maritime Silk Road (Belt and Road Initiative) during visits to Central and Southeast Asia respectively, which has attracted close attention from the world. Rooted in the principle of mutual consultation, joint efforts and shared interests, the Initiative is committed to a free trade system and an open global economy, encouraging countries along the Belt and Road (B&R) to achieve coordination of economic policies and jointly creating an open, inclusive and balanced regional economic cooperation architecture that benefits all.\nAgricultural exchanges and trade were an important part of the ancient Silk Road, via which flax, pomegranate, alfalfa, grape and other plants came to China, and Chinese know-how and products like well digging, silk and tea went to Central Asia and farther. Countries were benefited from wider spread of farming skills and commodities. Agricultural civilization expanded and prospered in Asia, Europe andAfricathrough closer connectivity of countries. In the new era, agriculture remains the foundation of the national economy in B&R countries, and agricultural cooperation is their common pursuit since many long to fight hunger, eradicate poverty, and achieve food and nutrition security. Therefore under the Initiative, agricultural cooperation can be a good foothold for B&R countries to build a community of common interests and destiny.\nIn the past three years, great progress has been made in agricultural cooperation betweenChinaand countries along the Belt and Road. We have entered into proactive collaborations and connection through bilateral and multilateral cooperative mechanisms. Cooperative scope has expanded in width and depth, and is joined by increasing number of players in diversified ways. ThisVision and Actionis thus drafted to foster top-level design on agricultural cooperation along the Belt and Road.\nNow the world is undergoing profound and complex changes. As repercussions of the financial crisis linger on, the economy recovers at a slow pace, and development is uneven. Trade and investment landscape and multilateral rules are undergoing major adjustments. The Initiative to jointly build the Belt and Road, embracing the trend towards a multi-polar world, economic globalization, cultural diversity and greater IT application, is a positive endeavor to seek new models of international cooperation and global governance.\nTransformation has also occurred in the global agricultural development structure in recent years. Climate change inflicts deeper and deeper impact upon major grain producing regions. Bio-energy, financial speculation and other non-traditional factors build up uncertainties in the global agricultural market. Food insecurity and poverty plague many developing countries, and there are still 795 million people suffering from chronic hunger and 2 billion people from malnutrition. Lack of momentum for a sustained growth and changes in the supply and demand structure at agricultural market are the new issues and challenges for countries all over the world to address jointly. Especially, it’s imperative for many countries along the Belt and Road to achieve food and nutrition security and eliminate hunger and poverty. So there is an urgent need to conduct cooperation to jointly promote agricultural sustainability.\nIn post financial crisis years, countries are even more committed to agriculture which is foundation of the economy, paying more attention to the integration and utilization of global agricultural resources and deep exploration of agricultural market, thus more aspirant to carry out cooperation. This brings historic opportunities for countries to promote agricultural cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative. NowChinais working closely with Belt and Road countries to dock strategies and build framework for cooperation. The bolstered bilateral and multilateral mechanisms offer platforms and infrastructure connectivity and financial intermediation provide guarantees to pursue the endeavor. Favorable conditions are laid for countries to achieve complementarities in agriculture and share development opportunities.\nChina’s agricultural sector and that of the world are closely connected. It is significant to boost agricultural cooperation along the Belt and Road, which is necessitated by the need forChinato further expand and deepen the opening-up, and for the world agriculture to grow in a sound and sustained way. It is also significant in its conduciveness to shape the landscape of agricultural cooperation in the world, and tap comparative advantages of countries along the Belt and Road. It will foster orderly flow of factors, efficient allocation of resources, and deep integration of markets in the region, and facilitate B&R countries to gain economic benefits and win-win growth. Since late 1970s,Chinahas scored achievements in agriculture and rural areas and made contributions to the world food security. Committed to shouldering more responsibilities and obligations within its ability,Chinais ready to contribute its wisdom to the global governance on food and agriculture, and share experience with Belt and Road countries so as to contribute more to agricultural and economic growth in the world.\nPolicy coordination.Countries along the Belt and Road are supported to conduct vision matching and policy dialogue, seek convergence of interests and the maximum common interest, and jointly hammer out the top-level design for key areas, leading industries, and important products of common concerns. Existing mechanisms should be fully tapped to drive forth long-lasting agricultural cooperation along the Belt and Road in an innovative manner.\nMarket operation.Companies are leading players. Market is to play the decisive roles in resource allocation, and market rules and international norms are to be followed. Enterprises will be supported to conduct cooperation among them to seek complementarities and common development.\nGovernment service.Cooperation mechanisms among governments will guide and work for agricultural cooperation along the Belt and Road. Efforts will be made to deepen opening-up, improve investment and trade facilitation, set up or improve the service network, and optimize the atmosphere for cooperation.\nGreen and sharing.Countries are respected to choose their own development path and mode. Agricultural cooperation along the Belt and Road echoes goals on food and agriculture of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and advocates the principle ofmutual consultation, joint efforts and shared interests for a greenSilk Road. Concerted efforts are solicited to realize agricultural modernization with high efficiency, product safety, resource conservation and environmental consciousness.\nMutual benefit.Interests and concerns of all parties will be accommodated, advantages in agriculture of all countries be synergized, and cooperative potentials tapped. Cooperation along major economic corridors will be cemented to drive forward the whole cooperation process and build new cooperative ties along the Belt and Road marked by interdependence, mutual benefit, equality, safety and efficiency.\nThe Belt and Road run through the continents of Asia, Europe andAfrica, connecting the vibrant East Asian economic circle with a long farming history at one end and the developed European economic circle with advantages in modern agriculture at the other. It links up countries with rich resources and huge potential across vast regions that enjoy advantages and complementarities in agricultural resources, technologies, productivity, and markets.\nIt is the shared vision and aspiration for countries along the Belt and Road to promote cooperation and develop agriculture. China is ready to work together with Belt and Road countries to plan and implement a group of key projects and build the new structure of agricultural cooperation with links running eastward and westward over land and sea, which supports the shaping of the community of shared interests, the community of shared responsibilities, and the community of shared future along the Belt and Road.\nThe Chinese government proposes that Belt and Road countries seek complementarities through stronger connection of strategies on agricultural cooperation, on basis of the principle ofmutual consultation, joint efforts and shared interestsand concepts of peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and benefits under the Belt and Road Initiative, accommodate interests and concerns of all parties involved, proceed from science and technology, focus on policy coordination, facilities connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration, and people-to-people bonds to deepen collaborations on optimal technologies, priority products, and trade and investment along the six economic corridors (new Eurasian Land Bridge, China-Mongolia-Russia, China-Central Asia-West Asia, China-Indochina Peninsula, China-Pakistan, and Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar), and work jointly for a full-fledged and wide-ranged new cooperative relationship.\nBelt and Road countries, with great potential and broad fields for cooperation, need to proceed from common development goals and advantages to seek closer collaborations in the following key areas:\nPolicy dialogue platform.We should enhance policy communication, improve existing policy dialogue mechanisms at different levels, and establish a tripartite policy dialogue platform for governments, institutes, and enterprises to exchange views on development and dock strategies, work out plans and measures to press forward cooperation, address problems through consultation, and provide policy support for pragmatic cooperation and implementation of key projects.\nAgricultural science and technology.We should prioritize science and technology cooperation and strengthen knowledge sharing, technology transfer, information communication, and personnel exchanges through multiple channels. In accordance with needs of countries along the Belt and Road and the bigger picture of international cooperation on agricultural science and technology, we should establish joint labs, experiment and demonstration bases and agricultural science and technology demonstration parks (zones), prevent and control animal and plant diseases and outbreaks, and conduct germplasm exchange, joint research and showcase of findings to enhance exchanges on species, technology, and products. We should jointly build the public information service platform(s) for agricultural cooperation along the Belt and Road, the technical advice and service system(s), and high-end think tank(s) and training base(s), so as to promote regional Internet of Things in agriculture and capacity of B&R countries to grow agriculture.\nAgricultural trade.We should jointly build routes and infrastructure for integrated logistics such as transportation and storage so as to improve facilitation, increase volumes and expand fields on trade. We should encourage building all kinds of stable channels for trade of Belt and Road products and boost cross-border e-commerce. We should have closer cooperation on inspection and quarantine, and jointly develop safe, efficient and convenient traceability system(s) and supervision and control measures to inspect and quarantine imports and exports so as to regulate market behaviors and secure a higher level of animal and plant health and safety in Belt and Road countries.\nAgricultural investment.We should draw on comparative strength in agriculture and cooperative mechanisms and channels of international financial institutions to increase investment in infrastructure and the whole industrial chain including production, processing, storage, transportation and distribution and impel the implementation of key projects. We should upgrade collaborations among enterprises, adopt all possible ways to improve their capacity and profile for transnational investment, and promote mutually beneficial growth of agribusinesses. We should encourage two way investment into agriculture.Chinawelcomes agricultural investment from enterprises of Belt and Road countries and encourages Chinese enterprises to take up social responsibilities and contribute to agricultural development along the Belt and Road by assisting the host country to advance agriculture, create employment opportunities, and improve livelihood.\nCapability building and non-governmental exchanges.We should foster farmer-focused capacity building and non-governmental exchange activities. Efforts should be made to jointly provide vocational education and training to empower farmers with necessary capacities and organizational skills, and build up confidence and trust among involved countries. We should also collectively build training bases for transnationals to cultivate all around talents and managers.\nFor smooth implementation of collaborative activities as planned, countries along the Belt and Road should build on existing mechanisms and improve modalities creatively to vigorously promote agricultural cooperation.\nBilateral cooperation between governments.We should conduct communication and consultation at different levels through various channels to seek comprehensive development of bilateral relations so as to support agriculture cooperation. We should facilitate signing of memorandums or formulating of plans on agricultural cooperation under the MOUs of cooperation on the joint development of the ""Belt and Road"" between governments. We should play the role ofexisting high-level cooperative mechanisms to attract more Belt and Road countries and territories as well as international and regional organizations to set up high quality active agricultural cooperation mechanisms. We should underscore intergovernmental talks on treaties and instruments to accelerate the signing of bilateral investment and trade agreements, and enhance communication and coordination to heighten cooperation on investment protection, finance, taxation, customs clearance, inspection and quarantine, and personnel exchanges to meet enterprise needs with government services, thus creating a sounder environment and better conditions for agricultural cooperation along the Belt and Road\nMultilateral cooperation mechanisms.We should deepen cooperation with IOs and give full play to existing agriculture related multilateral mechanisms such as the G20, APEC, SCO, UNESCAP, the Asia Cooperation Dialogue, the League of Arab States, China–ASEAN, and the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation. We should also deepen cooperation with the WTO, FAO, OIE, IPPC, IFAD, WFP, and the CGIAR, and with global and regional developmental financial institutions such as the WB, ADB, NDB, AIIB, and SRF to explore new financial services, thus creating an open, inclusive, equitable, competitive and mutual beneficial environment for agricultural cooperation.\nMajor conferences and forums.We should make the most of platforms set up by major conferences and forums such as the China-Africa Cooperation Forum, the Boao Forum for Asia, Roundtable Meeting on ASEAN Plus Three Food Security Cooperation Strategy, the China-ASEAN Exposition, the China-South Asia Expo, the China-Eurasia Exposition, the China-Central and Eastern European Countries Economic and Trade Forum, theChina-Central and Eastern European Countries Cooperation Forum on Entry-Exit Animal and Plant Quarantine & Quality and Safety of Agricultural Products, and the China-Arab States Exposition. Within the framework of the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, we should establish a dialogue mechanism for Belt and Road agricultural cooperation, a research and communication platform for agricultural planning, and an information-sharing platform for agricultural resources, industries, technologies, and policies at the Belt and Road portal.\nOverseas agricultural cooperation parks (zones).We should work together to jointly build agro-industrial parks to seek cluster and platform effect so as to reduce the cost of agricultural cooperation and prevent risks. We should also guide and support enterprises to participate in parks’ construction and operation, and infrastructure development in sectors including planting, animal farming, processing, and logistics to optimize the agro-industrial chain, thus supporting the connectivity of the economic corridors and the maritime Silk Road. Demonstration zones for agricultural cooperation can be jointly established on basis of aspiration and local conditions of B&R countries to support and showcase Belt and Road agricultural cooperation\nVI.Action and Future\nThe Chinese government has been promoting and expanding the opening-up of agriculture and optimizing policy frameworks to partake in the process of agricultural globalization. The Belt and Road countries have been priority areas forChinato have cooperation in agriculture for years. Many provinces and autonomous regions have taken advantage of their linkages in location and culture with neighboring countries for conducive and productive cooperation. Western provinces and autonomous regions collaborated with Central Asian countries in dry-land farming of grain, cotton and animal production, whilenorthern provincesworked together withRussiain cereal and vegetable production in the Far East region, and southern provinces proceed from tropical agriculture to engage in cooperation with Southeast Asia andSouth Asiaon grain and cash crop cultivation. All have made notable achievements. In addition,Chinahas explored many ways to assist B&R countries to raise production and improve the ability for safety and health control such as construction of technology demonstration centers, fielding experts, and training technicians and administrators, thus making positive contribution to the world food security.\nIn the future, China will keep promoting agricultural cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative by partaking in the development of regional agricultural cooperation platform(s), supporting talks on agriculture-related trade and investment agreements bilaterally or multilaterally, jointly devising the plan of bilateral cooperation on agricultural investment, increasing agricultural investment in least developed countries, facilitating implementation of 10 cooperation plans between China and Africa, mobilizing the “South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund” and promoting South-South Cooperation in agriculture, supporting developing countries to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, engaging in agricultural cooperation with developed countries innovatively, assisting in formation of a new pattern of relationship on agricultural cooperation, and promoting agricultural sustainability in the world.\nNext, China will promote building of overseas demonstration parks (zones) for agricultural cooperation and domestic cooperative experiment zones for agricultural opening-up and cooperate with Belt and Road countries in finance, taxation, insurance, and inspection and quarantine of animals and plants, bolstered exchanges of personnel and information, sharing of agricultural technologies, experience, and development modalities, and jointly planning and implementing seven key projects, i.e. enhancing comprehensive grain productivity in the region, science and technology cooperation and demonstration, joint prevention and control of animal and plant diseases and outbreaks, agricultural vertical integration, strengthening trade infrastructure, building the platform for agricultural R&D and training, and developing IT application network(s) for agriculture.\nThe Belt and Road Initiative is proposed byChinabut shares common aspiration of countries along the route.Chinais ready to work with Belt and Road countries under the existing bilateral and multilateral cooperative mechanisms and frameworks and walk toward each other to promote agricultural cooperation along the Belt and Road to another broader and higher stage that respects interests and appeals of all parties concerned.Chinais willing to make greater contribution to food and nutrition security and agricultural sustainability in the world.']"	['<urn:uuid:9fef49b5-5c01-4c52-88a8-a6190643f13c>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	9	31	2872
41	ancient obsidian mirror manufacturing requirements materials available catalhoyuk region	No special technological innovation was required to produce obsidian mirrors in ancient Çatalhöyük. While the immediate locality only had access to clay, lake-bed marl, grasses, and animal hide, suitable materials for grinding and polishing obsidian could be obtained from the Tarus Mountains to the south and several volcanoes in other directions. The process primarily required materials for grinding and polishing stone, which was already evident in the archaeological record through the presence of other ground and polished stone tools and ornaments.	"['A publication of the Archaeological Institute of America\nMaking a mirror the old-fashioned way\nCypriot ship painted on a modern pot shows clearly on polished obsidian surface. (James Vedder)\nAmong the intriguing finds at the Neolithic site of Çatalhöyük in central Anatolia are a few polished obsidian artifacts believed to have been used as mirrors. In a letter in response to an article, ""The World\'s First City"" (March/April 1998), which mentions the obsidian mirrors, P.H.M. Hawley wrote, ""to make such a mirror requires considerable technology in a sense. To grind a flat surface and then achieve a true polish is not easy"" (May/June 1998, p. 11). In an accompanying comment, Orrin Shane (an author of the original article and a curator at the Minnesota Museum of Science) said of the Çatalhöyük mirrors, ""Their exceptional planar surfaces are highly polished and reflect a sharp image."" I was curious just how difficult it would be and how long it would take to make an obsidian mirror.\nIn December 1999, I started to fashion a small one by hand, using various readily available materials (some artificial) to grind and polish a broken obsidian nodule. A fragment of concrete sidewalk provided the rough surface for the initial grinding. Once there was a flat surface, I continued, using in order, the side of a discarded abrasive wheel, a fine whetstone, and a fine clay slip on a piece of plate glass. The result was a nearly flat polished area that produced an excellent reflection. After this first success, I used three more obsidian nodules and an obsidian lump with conchoidal surfaces that had lost their luster during long exposure, grinding and polishing them with materials such as granite, quartzite, sandstone, slate, marble, sand, fine-grained stone, clay, and wood ash. The most used for grinding were granite, sand, sandstone, and the fine-grained stone. The fine grained stone gave a fairly good polish, while the others were used briefly to verify that a wide range of materials are effective in the process. I observed the sun\'s reflection and examined the obsidian surface with a 10x hand lens to evaluate the progress of the grinding and polishing and took great care to keep the surface clear of extraneous material to reduce the possibility of generating scratches. I have yet to explore fully various possible final burnishing, buffing, and polishing procedures. The wood ash was briefly tried as a final polishing agent, but it was probably too fine-grained to improve the existing state of the polished surface with out the expense of an inordinate amount of time. Materials for grinding and polishing comparable to those listed above can be found in Turkey.\nThe largest mirror surface I produced is about 4 by 6 centimeters (1.6 by 2.4 inches). With experience, one could probably select an optimum set of materials to expedite the creation of a mirror surface. Since achieving the final polish may take the longest time, I can not estimate now the time required to make a mirror.\nAll of the mirrors produced good images, and all were slightly convex as expected from manual grinding in which linear and rotary motions result in greater pressure being applied around the perimeter of the surface. The only technical reference that I have seen on an obsidian mirror from Çatalhöyük states that it is slightly convex. With special preparation of a core and great care during the grinding process, one could probably make a nearly flat mirror with no obvious distortions in the image.\n""STOP"" image is reflected in experimental obsidian mirror. (James Vedder)\nDuring my stay at Çatalhöyük in August 2000, I collected information from unpublished notes and speaking with those at the site who had any familiarity with obsidian and grinding stones. I was able to see eight of the Çatalhöyük mirrors. Three each were in the Archaeological Museum of Konya and the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in Ankara. Dim lighting and glass cases made it difficult to discern details of fabrication. Two in storage at the Konya museum could be inspected close-up. Their faces were slightly convex, as I had suspected; but they were badly scratched, probably from post-manufacturing usage and disposal.\nPictures of at least six obsidian artifacts from Çatalhöyük were published and claimed to be mirrors by the site\'s first excavator, James Mellaart, who dug there in the 1960s. Naomi Hamilton (a participant in the current efforts at the site) in her unpublished inventory of artifacts from Çatalhöyük held in the Konya and Ankara museums lists 11 items as mirrors or possible mirrors. Those shown by Mellaart are in this list. I have verified that eight of the 11 objects are mirrors and rejected two. One of these two, described by Hamilton as possibly a broken mirror with grinding marks, has linear sets of abrasions at several angles that have obliterated the luster on 60 percent of the surface but have not flattened it. The other, described as a questionable mirror fragment or flake, is a long, thin curved piece lacking luster. The eleventh item, in storage at the Konya museum, is possibly the beginnings of a mirror in the early stage of grinding a core to produce a flat surface.\nWhat purpose did they serve? The conventional answer given by Mellaart is for a woman to view her application of make-up, but few obsidian mirrors have been found and these only in the middle occupation levels at Çatalhöyük. Various alternative uses have been suggested, some practical (illuminating rooms or shafts, starting fires, reflecting sunlight for a compact seasonal calendar, or signalling) and some spiritual (viewing one\'s soul or performing special rites). No mirrors have been found in the recent excavations, under the general direction of the University of Cambridge\'s Ian Hodder; but only the group from the University of California, Berkeley, is working at the levels IV to VI in which Mellaart discovered the objects.\nIn conclusion, there is abundant archaeological evidence for grinding and polishing stone to make tools and ornaments. No technological innovation was required before obsidian mirrors could be produced.

This can be complemented by consuming 7 or more daily servings of produce, as research shows this reduces risk of dying from any cause by 42%. Having healthy snacks with protein and fiber, along with regular physical activity, provides comprehensive immune support.	"['5 Steps to Healthier Eating\nIs that bag of potato chips your go-to snack? Or do you constantly surrender to your sweet tooth? If so, it’s time to kick the habit. Here are 5 steps to help you stay satisfied while achieving healthier eating habits.\n1. Power Up with Produce\nHealthy habits begin at the grocery store. So once you arrive, head straight to the produce section – it can literally save your life. Research published in The Journal of Nutrition reported that a a diet rich in fruit, berries and vegetables reduced risk of dying. And, a recent study published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, found that adults who ate 7 or more servings of produce daily were 42% less likely to die from any cause during the 7 ½ year study. In addition, those eating the most produce (7+ servings per day) reduced risk of dying from heart disease by 31% and from cancer by 25 percent. Remember, all forms of produce count toward your daily quota—including fresh, frozen (no added sugar), dried or 100% juice.\nWhen you bring your produce home from the supermarket, immediately wash, slice, and store them on your refrigerator shelves so that they are the first things you see when you open the door. While it’s true you might lose some nutrients when you cut into your produce, that’s more incentive to eat them quickly once prepped. The bright colors and easy access of these power foods will entice your appetite and decrease your chances of reaching for less healthy options.\n2. Pack Your Snack\nSnacking can be smart – it boosts energy levels and wards off hunger between meals. And while a whopping 97 percent of Americans snack daily (up from 71 percent thirty years ago), most people’s snacks are less than healthful. Instead of the typical “junk food” snacks, keep healthy snacks on hand (in your purse, car, gym bag, or office) so you have nutritious foods available when hunger hits.\nTop snacks to pack include some protein and fiber for staying power. Aim for a portion-controlled bag of trail mix, an apple and string cheese, a lowfat yogurt with berries, or a Suja Classic juice and a few almonds. By having healthful snacks on hand you’ll nourish your body and avoid overeating at your next meal.\n3. Eat Aware\n“Eat aware” means to make an effort to become more mindful when you eat—at least once a day. It might seem productive to multi-task to get more done, but when you eat and never pay attention to your food, you’re more likely to feel unsatisfied after your meal, and more likely to eat again later searching for that satisfaction.\nA study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that the presence of the distracting stimuli of playing solitaire on the computer during lunch caused participants to eat more as compared to nondistracted participants. The distracted participants also reported feeling less full and had a poorer memory as to how much they had eaten as compared to the nondistracted participants.\nWhile aiming to “eat aware” has its benefits, it doesn’t mean you have to assume a lotus position or savor the inner essence of every raisin you consume. All it takes is just a few extra minutes a day focusing on your food – its taste, how it smells, and the texture. You’ll find you eat more slowly, enjoy your food more, and are satisfied with less. That’s a good thing.\n4. Out of Sight, Out of Mind\nWhen you have a toddler, you childproof your home. So when you want to eat healthy, why not fat-proof your home? Of course you can’t control every environment, but you can take steps to help yourself. First, if you’re preparing food at home, don’t buy your “trigger” foods. If you want something sweet, go for some frozen grapes. If you love soda, stock your fridge with sparking water and add a splash of 100% juice. The idea is not to create an environment of deprivation, but to replace less healthful foods with better-for-you options you still enjoy.\nAnother safeguarding strategy is based on the old standby, “out of sight, out of mind.” In other words, don’t keep fattening foods where you can see them. If you tend to inhale the bread basket at a sit-down restaurant, ask your waiter not to bring it—or take it away after you have one piece. Remember that the more food that is put in front of you, the more likely you are to eat it—so make an effort to reduce your “food exposure” when you can. More often than not, if you don’t see it you won’t miss it.\n5. Deny Defeat\nHealthy eating habits are for the long term and involve a healthy and happy mindset. A single food or meal doesn’t need to turn into an unhealthy day. Don’t allow nonsupportive thoughts to distract you from everything you have accomplished. Go for a brisk 20-minute walk, take a Yoga class, or simply breath deeply for 5 minutes to rewire your thought patterns back to a healthy mindset.\nOyinlola Oyebode, Vanessa Gordon-Dseagu, Alice Walker, Jennifer S Mindell.

J Epidemiol Community Health, 31 March 2014 DOI: 10.1136/jech-2013-203500', 'We hear it all the time - exercise for your health. But how does exercise impact later life? And\nif exercise hasn\'t ever been a regular routine, why are the retirement years a good time to start?\nThe benefits of exercise are many. It helps reduce stress, manage weight, stabilize blood sugar levels, supports brain and heart health, and the list goes on. Let\'s look at a few of these in more detail.\nExercise at all times of life, but especially in later life:\n* Benefits the immune system. Colds, the flu and other viruses can be more devastating to older adults whose immune systems are not as strong as they once were. But these germs have less of an impact on those who are exercising.\n* Contributes to independence. Physical activity helps build and maintain strength. Strength is needed for all aspects of independent living - cooking, cleaning, climbing stairs, and carrying groceries to name a few.\n* Manages many different chronic health conditions. Arthritis pain and stiffness can be partially managed by low-impact exercise such as water aerobics, swimming or bicycling. Calories burned during exercise can contribute to a healthy weight, which reduces heart disease and diabetes risks. For those with these conditions, exercise is an important factor in managing the diseases. Exercise may also improve memory and reduce the risk of some types of dementia.\n* Improves sleep quality. Sleep patterns change with age. Many older adults find it difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep. Exercise has helped many to enjoy longer and more restful sleep.\nA well-rounded exercise program targets several areas of strength to provide the greatest benefit. They include:\n* Doctor\'s approval. Prior to beginning an exercise program, talk to and receive a doctor\'s clearance.\n* Aerobic. Walking, swimming and low-impact aerobics are examples of aerobic exercise. It strengthens the heart and lungs, improves circulation, increases the red blood count, reduces the incidence of depression, and reduces blood pressure. To gain the greatest benefit from aerobic activity, it should last at least 20 minutes.\n* Flexibility. Flexible joints mean that it\'s easier to reach items on shelves, tie shoes, drive and much more. When joints are more flexible, they are also stronger. Stretching and yoga are excellent examples of exercises that can help maintain and improve flexibility.\n* Strength. Strength training uses resistance to increase the strength of specific muscle groups. Resistance can be in the form of weights, exercise bands or body weight. Strength training builds and maintains lean muscle mass, which is an important contributor to maintaining independence. Examples include biceps curls, leg extensions, and squats.\n* Balance. Balance training can decrease the risk of falls. Many balance exercises are incorporated into the aerobic or strength training sections of a workout program. They may include standing on one foot, quick stops and starts, walking heel to toe, and walking backward.\nArmed with the ""what"" and ""why"" of later life exercise, the next step is to find resources and programs that fit your personality and can be sustained over time.\nThe National Institute on Aging\'s ""Exercise and Physical Activity Guide"" is a great place to start. It is a free 120-page guide that provides excellent information about exercise for all ages, but especially for older adults. The chapters include preparing, beginning, and maintaining a good exercise routine. It also includes over 30 pages of sample exercises for strength, flexibility, and balance.\nAnother free National Institute on Aging resource is the ""Go4Life"" DVD. A personal trainer offers tips, motivation, success stories, and sample exercises for a more interactive exercise experience. To order or download these and other National Institute on Aging resources, search the internet for ""national institute on aging exercise.""\nFor those who prefer a group exercise experience, Kaunoa Senior Centers offer a variety of exercise classes at a very reasonable cost. All classes are included in the Kaunoa newsletter. To receive this newsletter, call 270-7308.\nAnd finally, the Maui County Office on Aging coordinates EnhanceFitness, an ongoing exercise program that meets three times weekly and is designed for adults 50 plus. EF sites are currently operating in Kihei, Spreckelsville, Kahului and Lahaina. For additional information, contact the Maui County Office on Aging at 270-7774.\nThere are many reasons that now is the right time to exercise. But as important as starting a regular exercise routine is maintaining it over time. When exercising stops, the benefits quickly fade away. Decide today to make exercise a part of the rest of your life.\n* Heather Greenwood is with the University of Hawaii Manoa Cooperative Extension, Maui Intergenerational and Aging Programs.

43	What's the key difference between how summative assessments and the 'Remembering' level in Bloom's taxonomy evaluate student learning?	Summative assessments (like state exams, midterms, finals, and standardized tests) evaluate overall learning at the end of a unit or course, while the 'Remembering' level in Bloom's taxonomy specifically focuses on the student's ability to recall and remember previously acquired information, such as being able to quote prices or mention safety rules from memory.	"[""In my previous blog, Learning Objectives – What They Are and Why You Need Them 1, we saw what a learning objective is and why it is important to frame good learning objectives. We have also seen that a good learning objective comprises three aspects viz. performance, condition, and criteria. In this post, we will look at Bloom’s taxonomy, which provides the basis for defining the performance aspect of learning objectives accurately.\nEducational Psychologist Dr. Benjamin Bloom identified 3 domains of learning that are required to improve performance: Cognitive (Knowledge), Attitude (Affective), and Skills (Psychomotor). Dr. Bloom developed a taxonomy of learning objectives for each of these domains. Over the next few weeks, we will take a closer look at the taxonomy for each of these domains.\nHe defined learning objectives at six levels for the Cognitive domain.\nLater, Prof. Lorin Anderson, a former student of Dr. Bloom, suggested revisions to this model. Prof. Anderson’s model focuses on the tasks performed at each level of cognition, rather than the outcomes. Another important change proposed by Prof. Anderson is moving the fifth level of cognition to sixth and vice-versa. Here is a representation of the revised model.\nThis week, I will review the first two levels i.e. Remembering and Understanding and provide examples of learning objectives written for these levels for 6 different types of training viz. sales training, product training, service technician training, software training, safety training, and social media policy training.\nLet us now look at the Remembering level.\nAt this stage, the learner must be able to remember and recall information that he has acquired previously. Examples of learning objectives at this level are:\n- The learner would be able to mention the safety rules from memory.\n- The learner would be able to quote the price of the lathe machine.\nThe verbs commonly used to frame learning objectives at this level are as follows.\nThe learner, at this stage, must be able to understand the meaning of the information and state it in his own words. Examples of learning objectives at this level are\n- The learner would be able to explain the process of adding a macro in an MS-Word document.\n- The learner would be able to restate the principle of congruence in his own words.\nHere are some of the verbs commonly used to frame learning objectives at this level.\n- Give examples\nNote: It is important to remember that the learning objectives need to reflect the mental processes taking place at each level and verbs are merely used to indicate the learning outcomes of the processes. In some cases, the same verb can be used to indicate the outcomes of mental processes involved at multiple levels. For instance, the verb identify can be used at the Remembering as well as Analyzing levels. Consider the two learning objectives.\n- The learner would be able to identify the parts of a machine.\n- The learner would be able to identify the root cause of the machine’s breakdown.\nIn the first objective the word identify is used to indicate the learning outcome of the mental process taking place at the first level of cognition (Remembering), while in the second it is used to indicate the result of the mental process taking place at the fourth level (Analyzing).\nWe will now look at a few examples of learning objectives written for these levels for 6 different types of training. sales training, product training, service technician training, software training, safety training, and social media policy training.\n|Training||Objective at the Remembering level||Objective at the Understanding level|\n|Sales Training||The learner would be able to list the steps in the sales process in order.||The learner would be able to explain the consequences of not following the sales process.|\n|Product Training||The learner will be able to state the features of the product.||The learner would be able to explain how the product meets the needs of the buyer.|\n|Service Technician Training||The learner would be able to label the parts of the product.||The learner would be able to match all the possible causes to the problem of car battery charge failure.|\n|Software Training||The learner will be able to organize the steps to create a pivot table using MS-Excel in order.||The learner would be able to distinguish the option “Save” from “Save As”.|\n|Safety Training||The learner would be able to identify the rules of fire safety.||The learner would be able to give examples of consequences of non-compliance of prescribed fire safety procedures.|\n|Social Media Policy Training||The learner would be able to identify potential violations of social media guidelines, while posting information about a client on LinkedIn.||The learner will be able to match possible consequences to the violation of guidelines pertaining to posting of financial information on social media.|\nBloom’s taxonomy has grouped various verbs, which can be used to describe what the learner will be able to do, under the six levels of cognitive domain. In my next post, we will look at the Applying and Analyzing levels. So, stay tuned.\nSubscribe to Our Blogs\nGet CommLab's latest eLearning articles straight to your inbox.

44	tips tricks capture photos bright light behind subject without ruining image	To capture photos with bright light behind the subject without ruining the image, there are several key techniques. First, you can use exposure compensation by adding one or two stops of positive exposure to prevent subjects from becoming dark spots. Another approach is using fill flash - artificial light from a speedlight or strobe to fill in shadows on the subject. When using fill flash, it's recommended to use a diffuser to soften the light, control the flash manually (usually at 1/32 or 1/16 power), and either bounce the flash off surfaces or angle it appropriately rather than pointing it directly at the subject. Additionally, you can use spot metering to measure light only from the subject's face, or use reflectors to bounce light back onto the subject. It's also helpful to shoot when the sun is near the horizon for softer light, use a lens hood to prevent lens flares, and position subjects to block direct light from hitting the lens.	['This is exactly what you probably have been asked NOT to do.\nShoot into the Sun.\nUnder normal circumstances that would indeed be perfectly good advice. But what if we could craft the downsides of shooting against the light and use it to make something truly amazing?\nWhat others are rejecting right out of the gate, how about we go the other way and try and find a strategy to make it actually work. This is exactly what I asked you to do about shooting in the rain.\nBeauty lies in the most uncommon places, can’t blame me for it!\nA Sticky Wicket\nLet’s start with a simple yet annoying situation.\nSay, you went to visit Machu Picchu. You only have an evening there, and the next day you are flying out of the country. There is no coming back another day.\nHere comes the kicker. When you show up to the site, it’s sunny as hell.\nSo, are you going to listen to all the advice you have received over the years about how not to shoot into the light?\nOr, are you going to find a way to do it anyway?\nIf you choose the second alternative, please let me help you with it.\nProtect The Downside\nShooting against the light is ill-advised for a reason.\nThe images are most likely to be not exposed properly, with dark, unrecognizable subjects shadowed by unintended silhouettes in most scenarios.\nIf you are lucky, you may even catch a lens flare with some rainbowy color intrusion in your photographs.\nHardly the perfect photograph.\nYes, all this would happen to you if (and this is a BIG if) you are on the “Auto” mode and let your camera take all the decisions for you leading up to the shutter release. This may also be the case even if you use a semi-automatic mode, such as Aperture priority (A/Av) or Shutter priority (S/Tv).\nBut we are not going to make these mistakes now that we know about them.\nThe situation above is almost akin to saying “You will lose a street race if you take a Prius.”\nWe already know how the camera meters light, and how a light source directly shining in the lens may throw the meter’s reading awry. So all we have to do is note the potential problems, find the root cause and protect against them.\nI have been talking about “shooting into the Sun” or “against the light” until this point but you need to understand what backlighting truly means.\nIn the simplest sense, you are shooting backlit when the primary source of your light is directly facing the camera.\nSince you would be naturally facing the subject you are about to shoot, the light would be coming from behind your subject. Lighting the back of your subject. You get it now?\nThe biggest hurdle in shooting backlit subjects is getting the exposure right.\nYou can’t really blame the camera for this, neither the light meter inside it. Let me explain where the problem stems from.\nAs you already know, the light meter inside our camera bodies is called a TTL (through the lens) meter. This is because it only meters light that comes in through the lens of our cameras. This is the same light that is reflected off of our subjects.\nUnder normal circumstances, this mechanism works just fine.\nThe problems with backlighting arise when light NOT reflected off of the subject starts reaching the camera meter. This extra light is what causes all the problems.\nAs soon as this extra light reaches the camera’s meter, the meter thinks that there is too much light in the scene to expose it properly. So, it naturally tries to cut out some light.\nIf the photographer now happens to shoot in any of the semi-automatic modes or for that matter full “Auto” mode, the cameras would have control over one or all of the three determinants of exposure. It would use this/these determinant(s) to control the incoming light.\nFor example, if the photographer were shooting using Aperture priority:\nThe camera would still have control over the shutter speed. To restrict the extra light, the camera may use a fast shutter speed.\nBecause of specifically this reason, images turn out darker than it should be and the subjects are barely discernable.\nUnfortunately, our cameras are still not smart enough to figure out a solution to this problem, by themselves. So you as the photographer need to step in and force the camera to use a given set of settings that are deliberately selected to properly expose the main subjects of the image.\nSo how do we take control of the camera and make it use the settings we want?\nThere are two major ways to do this:\nYes, you guessed it.\nExposure compensation is an easy little handy tool that you can use to tell the camera how to use the reading of its light meters.\nNow look, the situation is always going to be the same. The camera is always going to overestimate the amount of light available and underexpose the subject if left to itself.\nSo to prevent the subjects from turning into dark spots, what you can do is simply add one or two stops of exposure compensation. Adding one unit positive exposure compensation is just asking the camera to meter the scene and then whatever the value it deems fit, add the one extra stop of exposure to it.\nSo like the previous example, if the photographer was shooting using Aperture priority and the cameras were initially suggesting a value of say 1/500th of a second, after the addition of one positive unit of exposure compensation, the camera should use 1/250th of a second shutter speed to record the same scene.\nTo add the one extra stop of light, the camera slows down the shutter speed by half. Just to remind you, every stop of light doubles the brightness of the image.\nIf you do not have a well-defined idea about exposure compensation and how it works in conjunction with the cameras light meter, read How To Use Exposure Compensation To Gain Control Of The Exposure.\nYou could do the same thing we just did with exposure compensation using the Manual mode on the camera.\nRemember the idea is to NOT let the camera use the settings suggested by the light meter. When using the Manual mode, that is exactly what we do anyway.\nTo use the Manual mode method, first, we need to get a base reading of the scene.\nGet close to the subject and fill the frame with it. This is just to prevent the excess light to hit the meters. Get close/zoom in and see what settings the camera suggests. Remember these settings.\nNow shift to Manual mode and dial in the same settings, and you are good to go.\nI know I just contradicted myself but not really. This is why.\nRemember I asked you to get closer and stop the stray rays from getting inside the camera? Once you achieve this, the reading on the light meter becomes reliable and trustworthy once again. It becomes the same as shooting any other image (not backlit).\nApart from the two methods I just described above, you could handle this situation of extra light management in a few other ways, too.\nThe light meter inside our cameras erroneously projects a set of exposure settings that allows less light than is necessary to expose the subject properly. This error is primarily caused due to the stray rays of light reaching the meters of the sensor without being reflected off of the subject.\nThis you already know.\nWhat if we could cut off these stray rays of light altogether and not factor them in when metering the light?\nThat is exactly what we do when using the Spot metering mode. You may remember this from the post that I wrote about light meter (How To Best Use The Light Meter On Your Camera | Explained).\nThe beauty of spot metering is that we can force the camera to meter the light from only a very small part of the frame. Just a spot.\nThis helps us a lot with the problem.\nSay, we are shooting a person with his/her back against the Sun. Now, this situation is almost bound to create a backlighting problem. We could, however, skirt the problem by just switching to spot metering and asking the camera to meter the light ONLY from the subject’s face.\nWith the guided metering, the camera meters the incoming light properly and we get a well-exposed shot.\nNow instead of trying to cut out light and shape it as much as possible, we take the attack the other way by using a fill flash. We add more light.\nYes, you read that right.\nThe problem with backlit images is that very often in trying to expose the entire scene properly, the primary subject is compromised and underexposed. Couldn’t we just solve that by adding some light?\nSo we do just that.\nEverything else remains the same. We add some light to the scene using a fill flash.\nNeedless to say, this flash is solely focused on the subject.\nSo the Sun or the primary light source lights up all the scene and we try and use some artificial lights to bring up the subject’s brightness.\nSimple, isn’t it?\nNow depending upon the subject, the type of image and the feel you are going for, you could use remotely triggered strobes or even the popup flash on top of your camera. Suit yourself on this.\nSame story as above. This is just a passive way of adding light.\nIn this case, we do not use any artificial source of light to illuminate the subject. Instead, we use the light coming from the primary source and reflect some of it back on to our subjects.\nYou could use a dedicated reflector to do the job or you could improvise.\nNearly all objects (if it’s not completely black) reflect some amount of light back. So a white foam core, some printing paper stuck to a giant cardboard, a white wall, sand at the beach, all could potentially act as a reflector.\nThis is your creative space. See what you can use to reflect some light back on to the subject and it should work just fine.\nIf however, the reflector on its own cannot fill as much of the subject as you want to, you could always use some extra flash power and the reflector together to get the required amount of light.\n- Including the source of light in the frame will nearly always create an imbalance in the scene too far to bridge. This means that the image would be way too bright in some regions and way too dark in others. An easy way to overcome this is to use the subject itself to block the light source from directly shining in the lens.\n- More often than not, when trying to expose the subject properly, the background or foreground is going to be overexposed. Do not worry about it too much. Your subject is supposed to be the cornerstone of your image in any case. Try and find a way to incorporate this washed out background look into the image. It may add a lot of character and feel if done right. Do not fight it, go with the flow.\n- A lens hood is an absolute must when shooting against the light. This protects your lens as much as possible from stray rays of light and dramatically brings down the chances of lens flares.\n- Backlighting subjects produces a very soothing rim light around them. This effect comes to the forefront when the subject is translucent. Wine bottles, dew drops, human hair, glass, ice all are excellent for this.\n- The rim light acts as a good separator from the background. So make sure that your subject is placed against a relatively dark background to make good use of this effect.\n- Shoot in RAW if possible. This is going to give you the most amount of latitude to adjust your image, later in post-production.\n- If you are planning to use the Sun as the backlight, try and shoot when the Sun is near the horizon. That means either early or late in the day. The quality of light during this time is really soft and easy to work with.\n- Pro tip: It’s easier to recover shadows in digital images than bring back details from the highlights. So whenever in doubt, underexpose the image by a stop or two. You can fine-tune the exposure later in post-production.\nThat is it, guys. That is all you need to know to go out there and make some stunning backlit images.\nShooting into the light is not such a bad idea if you know how to go about it.\nKeep shooting beautiful.', 'What is fill flash photography, and how can you use fill flash for beautiful portraits?\nAs a longtime user of flash, I’m familiar with all the standard struggles (in fact, when I first purchased a Nikon speedlight, I was very scared). But over time, I became a confident user of fill flash, and you can, too.\nIn this article, I’m going to tell you everything you need to know to get you started with fill flash. First, I’ll explain what fill flash actually is and why it’s important. Then I’ll go on to give some tips that’ll make your flash look as good as possible. Along the way, I’ll share a few simple tricks for getting creative results with just one flash.\nLet’s get started.\nWhat is fill flash?\nFill flash in photography refers to the technique of filling in shadows with artificial light, such as a speedlight or a strobe.\nGenerally, fill flash is used in situations when your subject is either:\n- Positioned in front of a brighter background\n- Covered by harsh shadows (such as under the eyes and chin in portraiture)\nFill flash acts as a supporting light, one that pops a bit of brightness back into those too-dark areas. It lets you get a shot that is well exposed in the background and the foreground (as opposed to a foreground silhouette or a bright-white background).\nFill flash is especially useful on sunny days, when the harsh overhead light beats down on your subject and casts lots of unwanted shadows. But you can also use fill flash when the sun is low in the sky and your subject is backlit, or when your subject is in the shade and the background is bright, or a number of other times when you have a dark subject on a bright background.\nThe basics of flash exposure\nAs photographers, we have to learn a host of technical knowledge. That involves a lot of trial and error to find which methods work for you. It’s no different when it comes to camera settings and flash power.\nNormally, you must balance the three factors in the exposure triangle to achieve your intended look. For example, if you want a darker background with less ambient light, you can increase your shutter speed while keeping the aperture and ISO the same. But if you want ambient light in the background plus brighter shadows, you can lower your shutter speed while maintaining the aperture.\nAdding the flash power as a 4th factor is no different. You simply have four variables to contend with rather than three.\nSo when you bring fill flash into the equation, you have the option of adjusting its power to brighten or darken the image. Or you can leave the flash power as a constant, then adjust the rest of the exposure variables to achieve the look you’re after.\nAs long as you have ample understanding of the basics of exposure, you’ll do just fine. Simply play around and find what works best for you; you want an approach that will make you efficient while also staying consistent with your workflow and style.\nNow that you’re familiar with the basics of fill flash photography, let’s take a look at some tips for actually improving your flash results:\n1. Put a diffuser on the flash\nIt may only be a little plastic thing that goes on top of the flash head, but I find that a diffuser does make a difference.\nWith a diffuser, the light is less harsh. I know many will disagree about whether it actually softens the light, but I notice a softness from a diffused flash compared to a bare one.\n2. Control the flash manually\nWhen using flash, there are two common ways of determining the right exposure:\nExposing manually, or exposing with ETTL/TTL metering.\nAnd I highly recommend you just do it manually.\nNow, I know there are many big fans of ETTL/TTL mode out there. I have tried it, too. However, I have gone back to manual exposure as I find that TTL metering does not give me the look I want.\nSo set your flash to Manual mode and choose the power. I usually dial in 1/32 or 1/16 and leave it there. Adjust the flash power only when absolutely necessary. For basic exposure changes, just adjust your standard camera settings.\nWhat I’m after is always a natural look which, depending on where the main light is coming from, may not be achieved without some kind of fill or reflected light to illuminate too-dark areas.\nBut I don’t just point my flash directly at my subject and fire wildly. Instead, I either bounce or angle my flash, as I explain in the next section:\n3. Bounce the flash\nOn some speedlight models, there is a little white pull-out bounce card that is extremely useful if your ceilings are too high for the light to bounce off or you just want to point reflected light in a particular direction.\nWhen I shoot weddings where the rooms have very dark or high ceilings, I pull out the bounce card and use it to deflect the light coming from the flash. I then swivel the flash to direct the reflected light wherever I want it to go.\nAs an aside, I use this setup for both on-camera flash and off-camera flash. When I’m putting two speedlights opposite each other to provide directional light during speeches, I point the flash heads upward and pull out the diffuser so that all the reflected light is pointed toward the center of the room.\n4. Angle the flash\nThe head of most speedlights can swivel right and left up to 90 degrees and forward and upward 90 degrees in incremental angles. It is an awesome function that you should take advantage of – especially when using fill flash.\nIn the photos below, bright sunlight was coming from camera right at 45 degrees on a bright day. All I wanted was a bit of fill flash on their faces, just enough to lift the shadows a tad. And I didn’t want the image to look like there was another light source other than the sun. To achieve this, I angled my speedlight upward by one increment.\n5. Experiment with power and angle\nAs you can see, the photos below have powerful sunlight coming directly at the subjects and toward the camera – a very strong backlight. It is extremely difficult to overpower this type of light without using a strong fill flash.\nSo I angled myself slightly to one side and pointed my flash directly at the subjects’ faces to try and counteract the sunlight.\nIn situations like these, I increase my flash power accordingly. The result is not as clean and sharp as if I had a big softbox, but it still shows the faces clearly enough and I got some diffused, hazy light in the background, which was also my intention for these shots.\nCompare the two images below. The one on the left was taken in a big open space with a dense foliage background. There was enough natural light to illuminate my subjects’ faces, but I pointed the flash backward to add just a tiny bit of light over my head. I don’t think it made a huge difference, but it made me feel better and more consistent!\nThe image on the right was taken in an open, shaded area surrounded by tall trees that diffused the light coming from the background. Without the trees, I would’ve had unfiltered backlight (as in the photos above). With the trees, the backlight was filtered but still present.\nIn other words: More fill light was needed! I pointed the speedlight slightly upward so it was aimed toward the subjects but not directly at their faces.\nYou can see the same flash angle as above on these close-up portraits:\n6. Don’t overdo the fill flash (it’s okay to make things moody!)\nWhile I was shooting the couple featured above, I wanted a look that was a little moodier. So I pointed the speedlight directly upward.\nAlthough the fill flash ensured their faces remained well-lit, the couple appears enveloped by the diffused light behind them:\n7. Don’t be afraid to underexpose the subject\nTake a look at the top image:\nNotice how the couple is pretty dark, while the background is well exposed? The couple wanted a shot showing the lake and the trees in the far distance. But the distance was too great to get the couple and the background sharp and well exposed without using a really small aperture and a lot of artificial light (flash).\nSo I took two shots.\nThe first one is of the couple looking toward the trees. Everything is sharp, but the couple is clearly underexposed. I pointed the speedlight slightly forward to give them just a hint of light and shot with a small aperture.\nThe second image has the same angle of flash – but I got closer, and I changed my camera settings to a wider aperture. The background is now blurry while the couple is in focus.\nFor this ring shot, we sat on a bench with the sunlight coming from camera left. I put the ring on my phone to get a dark background and a nice reflection. With ring shots, I always stop down to at least f/7.1 with a macro lens. I also always use a speedlight pointed directly opposite the main light. So in this case, I swiveled my flash head to create a bit of reflected light on the right side of the ring.\nLikewise, for the photo below, you can clearly see where the sunlight is coming from. I pointed my speedlight slightly upward to camera left, opposite the sunlight. This angle helped me achieve a gradual transition of light, as opposed to a dramatic decrease where you could see a clear cutoff from light to dark.\nYour turn to try doing fill flash photography\nIf you haven’t tried using flash like this, I encourage you to do so. Experiment. See how it works for you! Sometimes all you need is confidence, common sense, and a willingness to try.\nAnd if you’re successful, share your fill flash images in the comments below! We’d love to see them!\nTable of contents\n- Fill Flash Photography: How to Get Beautiful Portraits (Even in Bad Light)\n- ADVANCED GUIDES\n- CREATIVE TECHNIQUES']	['<urn:uuid:9b2536b0-79ac-4b36-9904-587eecf79be0>', '<urn:uuid:c7db3afd-e2d8-4afe-81e9-512e538d419f>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	11	162	3912
45	what makes event mysterious versus normal situation example explain	A mystery is essentially an event out of context. For example, a live dolphin lying on a Manhattan sidewalk would be mysterious, but that same dolphin in an aquarium tank would not be mysterious. Similarly, ten thousand gallons of boiling caramel inside a Boeing 747 airplane would be mysterious, but that same caramel in a candy factory would not be. Every strange event has some surrounding circumstance or context that will make it non-mysterious.	['Art, Mysteries, and Context\nIn my books and workshops on scientific paranormal investigation, I discuss how best to conceptualize a mystery: basically, an event out of context. A live dolphin lying on a Manhattan sidewalk is a mystery; that same dolphin in a tank at an aquarium is not. Ten thousand gallons of boiling caramel inside a Boeing 747 airplane is a mystery; that same caramel in a candy factory is not. Every mystery or strange event has some surrounding circumstance or context that will render it non-mysterious.\nThe investigator’s job is to find a scientifically plausible context in which the mysterious phenomenon makes sense. Often a mystery is created when the facts are merely lacking a context, but a mystery can also be created when the facts are put into the wrong context.1 Thus, one of the chief duties in examining “unexplained” claims is understanding the (environmental, social, cultural, psychological, etc.) context of miracle reports, UFO photographs, and so on.\nI was reminded of this during a recent visit to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. One featured exhibit, Lifelike, “invites close examination of artworks—startlingly realistic, often playful, and sometimes surreal—based on commonplace objects and situations.” The show featured ninety works from fifty artists, including Alex Hay’s Paper Bag (1968), an exact replica of an ordinary paper bag (except that it’s six feet tall and made of fiberglass); Vija Celmins’s Freeway (1966), a photorealistic oil painting one would swear is a photograph at first glance; Daniel Douke’s Ace (1979), a seemingly ordinary mailing box complete with packaging tape and scuffs yet mounted chest-high on a wall and made of acrylic and Masonite; and Ron Mueck’s Crouching Boy in Mirror (1999–2000), a stunningly realistic life-size sculpture of a boy looking at himself in a mirror. In this world, scale and apparent utility cannot be trusted: pocket combs are as large as filing cabinets and working elevators are scaled down to the size of a deck of cards.\nThis is fertile playground for artists, illusionists, and skeptics: Things that seem real often are not, and things that don’t seem real sometimes are. Everything must be questioned: every basic assumption and premise, even the ordinary—especially the ordinary. The same is true for investigations and skepticism in general.\nOne of the most interesting pieces at Lifelike was also the most mundane (and for the same reason). It was Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone’s still.life (cardboard leaning on the wall) (2009). The piece, about four feet square, is a slightly banged-up piece of cardboard, with all the familiar patterns and creases we’d expect to find on any ordinary piece of cardboard sitting next to a city dumpster. It is in fact an incredibly detailed bronze sculpture (see Figure 1).\nWhich brings me back to the issue of context. A photograph (indeed, even a close visual inspection) of the piece does not betray its true nature. Without touching or weighing it, we have no way of deducing anything about it. The same is often true for photographs of Bigfoot, UFOs, ghosts, etc. This is where context informs the investigation: If I photographed still.life in an alleyway, there would be no reason to think or assume it was anything except what it seems to be.2 Rondinone’s sculpture, seen or photographed, does exactly what it is intended to do: fool the viewer. (Even when photographed against a gallery wall, the context doesn’t give the viewer much of a clue to its true nature.)\nBut what if there was an additional piece of important information that gave the mystery (or, rather, apparent non-mystery) context? If I showed someone a photograph of still.life and mentioned that the photo was taken at a famous art museum, that changes everything, providing both a reason to doubt its apparent nature and context for solving the mystery. The information doesn’t completely explain it—after all, it could simply be a piece of discarded cardboard leaning against a wall in the receiving dock because it’s too big to fit in the trash. But it provides a clue, an important first step in solving mysteries.\nArt means many things to many people—and it can even include lessons in skepticism from a piece of cardboard that’s not really a piece of cardboard.\n1. For example, if a woman is thinking about her friend who then suddenly calls, that context might make them think they share a psychic link, whereas the correct—and less mysterious—context is that the incident was likely an illusion created by confirmation bias.\n2. Note that this is not a fallacy but instead a completely reasonable and logical assumption; in fact, since the piece is unique in the world—there are no other bronze sculptures that size that look exactly like an ordinary creased cardboard panel—one would be completely justified using Occam’s razor in assuming it is precisely what it appears to be.']	['<urn:uuid:edf1d2e5-bab3-4083-9218-1f71f815c4fd>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	9	74	807
46	pectin content homemade preserves blackberry vs pepper	Pepper jelly recipes use a small amount of powdered pectin (1 1.75 ounce package) for a medium gel consistency. For blackberry preserves, the pectin content varies - unripe blackberries naturally contain more pectin than ripe ones, and the recipe uses jam sugar which has higher pectin levels than regular sugar. Additional pectin can be obtained by adding lemon rind to the blackberry jam.	['Chances are, if you live in the southern USA, you have seen and tasted pepper jelly. Pepper jelly is one of those staples that can be used in many things.\nIt saves a hostess when guests show up; pour some pepper jelly over cream cheese and some crackers and you have a marvelous snack with wine, beer or even iced tea.\nIt adds a special something to pan-fried pork chops and makes scrambled eggs amazing. Slathering some onto a biscuit or over some ham will leave you in taste bud heaven.\nWhile pepper jelly is a bit on the pricy side ($4.99 USD for a small 6 oz jar) it can be made rather quickly and you can adjust the heat to make it hot or just make it sweet.\nWhen you make this, set aside time to give it your full attention because it needs to be stirred constantly to prevent lumping and scorching.\nAs always, when working with hot sugar, be careful. Keep a bowl of ice water near your working space so if you get splashed, you can plunge it into ice water to prevent a bad burn.\nThere are many recipes for pepper jelly. This one does not use a large amount of pectin so it sets on a medium gel which makes it perfect for pouring over cream cheese, making a sauce or slathering onto a nice hot buttermilk biscuit.\nSouthern Pepper Jelly\n1 1/4 cup of finely diced red and orange peppers (one large pepper of each color)\n3/4 cup finely diced green pepper\n2 tablespoons finely diced jalapeno pepper OR 1 small Habanero\nWear gloves when handling hot peppers. If you get the hot peppers on your skin, soak the skin in milk, 1/2 & 1/2 or cream.\nDo not rub your eyes or touch small children or babies with hands that have just handled hot peppers.\n1/2 cup apple cider vinegar\n1 1.75 ounce package of powdered pectin\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n2 1/2 cups granulated sugar\nTake your time cutting the peppers. The best jelly has lovely evenly diced cubes of multicolored peppers floating the jelly. If you just hack and chop, you see uneven strands and bits and pieces of peppers which isn’t so nice to look at through the jar or when you are eating the jelly.\nHere is how to cut a nice looking pepper:\nWash the peppers and remove any sticky labels.\nTrim the top and bottom off, remove the stem and save the trimmed ends for kebab or in a salad or stir-fry.\nSlice the pepper so it becomes one long strip. Lay the pepper out with the skin side down. Remove the seeds and ribs from inside the pepper.\nUsing a sharp knife, remove the membrane from the inside of the pepper, leaving the plump pepper flesh. Just take a very thin slice from the surface to remove the membrane.\nMake long thin slices from the pepper (Julienne cut), then turn the strips and cut them into cubes. Do this carefully so you create a bowl full of nicely diced peppers.\nTrust me, it really makes a difference to take the time to do it right.\nPlace the diced peppers, vinegar and pectin into a saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly.\nBe careful of vinegar fumes, turn your exhaust fan on so you don’t get all choked up.\nWhen the mixture comes to a full rolling boil, add the sugar.\nReturn the mixture to another rolling boil, then boil it for 1 full minute while stirring constantly.\nRemove from heat and skim off any foam that may have formed on the top.\nYou can process the jelly in canning jars, hot water bath etc to seal and make them shelf stable. (Great idea for gifts)\nOr using clean, sterile jars, fill and invert them on the counter to cool. Once cool, turn them over and they seal will set, but you will need to refrigerate the jars.\nThis makes slightly over a pint.\nSoften cream cheese, to fancy it up a bit, put it in a piping bag and pipe the cream cheese out in a decorative pattern rather than just plopping a chunk of cream cheese on a plate.\nBut if you want to, you can do it that way. Lots of southern folks do.', 'We LOVE foraging at this time of the year and them returning home and baking blackberry or plum cakes and making easy jam. This year we are having a go at this easy blackberry and apple jam recipe. The thing about jam making – is that many people think it is terribly complicated – they worry about getting the consistency of the jam “just right” and because of that frequently, don’t even have a go. Remember: homemade jam tastes DELICIOUS and yes, it is great to have a perfect consistency, but equally, if it is a little runnier, so what? So long as it tastes nice, right? The blackberry and apple jam recipe shared here, resulted in a lovely consistency. But I have to confess, I think it was fluke just as much as anything.\nThe consistency of jam is affected by the pectin contained in fruit. Unripe blackberries have higher levels of pectin that ripe ones. A cooking apple has more pectin than an ordinary apple etc. So there are some variants right there. Under cook your jam and it won’t set. Overcook your jam and it wont set. ARGH. So. I say. Ignore all that, follow the BASIC rules and go for it. Experiment! See what happens, I am sure that the resulting jam will taste nice whatever the consistency and you will have taught the children a great new recipe, as well as the wonders of foraging and making your own jam.\nNote: when cooking with kids it is extremely important to observe Kitchen safety rules. Boiling jam is VERY hot and only an adult should pour it at any time. Make sure the children stand at a safe distance when you do this so they don’t accidently get splattered. Children can help wash, cut, chop and pour cold ingredients into the cooking pot. They can also help with the sieving (see below). Anything to do with the hot jam, should only be done by and adult.\nEasy blackberry and apple jam recipe\n- 900g of blackberries\n- 350g of apples (we used one from the garden and 2 granny smiths we wanted to use up, cooking apples are ideal)\n- 1kg Jam Sugar (which has a higher pectin level than preserving sugar, which has more than ordinary sugar – ordinary sugar is great for Lemon Marmalade, as lemons have high pectin levels)\nThis made around 5 and a bit 4o0g jars of blackberry and apple jam.\nNote: you can even out the apple/ blackberry ratio if you “like more apple bits”. You just need to make sure that your sugar/ fruit ratio stays roughly 1:1. You can also add a little lemon rind to increase the natural pectin levels if you wish, which means you need less sugar.\n- Try and make your jam as soon as possible after picking blackberries. Freshly picked blackberries can go off quickly as “picked by children” often means they end up a little squished etc.\n- Thoroughly wash your blackberries, getting rid of any bits and pieces and small bugs.\n- Place in a pot with a little water (1/4 of a cup or so) and bring to the boil for 10 minute or so. Cooking them thoroughly.\n- Take off the heat and squish through a sieve. Yes, this is a little laborious, but it will make your final jam taste much smoother and nicer! If you like “the bits and seeds” of course you can skip this step. If you do skip this step, you may want to add a little more sugar – make the fruit/ sugar ratio roughly 1:1 – i.e. 1.3kg. By sieving it, I am assuming I am “loosing” approx 200g of fruit.\n- Peel and chop your apples.\n- Place chopped apples, the strained blackberries and the sugar in a large sauce pan. Gradually heat until the sugar dissolves and then bring to the boiling point.\n- Boil rapidly for approximately 5minutes. (If you are super keen to get the consistency right, you can place a dish in the freezer BEFORE yous start, take the dish out of the freezer once you reach this step, add a little jam, the dish will cool it quickly. And if the jam looks stiff/ wrinkles when “poked”, you have the right consistency… I find this a faff and don’t bother!).\n- Carefully, pour into sterilized and warmed jars.\nKeep in store cupboard for 6 months or once opened stored in the fridge. Enjoy! And congratulate yourself and the kids for making your very own Blackberry and Apple Jam recipe! Yum.\nI think these make great little gifts too! Who doesn’t love some Blackberry and Apple Jam for breakfast?!']	['<urn:uuid:3782336f-d961-453c-b635-4a95186c9f29>', '<urn:uuid:2d1cafb3-a63e-4022-9fd4-6a719a9c64dc>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	7	63	1507
47	project management ancient modern definitions capabilities	Project management has existed since ancient times, from the pyramids of Egypt (2600 B.C.) to the Great Wall of China (500 B.C.). Today, it is defined as a 'temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result.' Modern project management software enables organizations to supervise multiple projects simultaneously, helping with planning, resource allocation, and change management, with the global market expected to reach USD 7 billion by 2026.	"['- All Topics\n- Training & Events\n- Buyer\'s Guide\nThough ""project management"" has become a popular buzzword in the last several years, it has been around for a long time, from the great pyramids of Egypt (circa 2600 B.C.), to the Great Wall of China (circa 500 B.C.) and the lunar missions of the 20th century. Of course, not all projects are as large and complex as these, but the components are the same.\nA project, as defined by the Project Management Institute, is a ""temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result."" Individuals involved in the maintenance and reliability world undertake small and large projects every day. The success of these projects rests firmly on the project manager\'s ability to properly plan the project and monitor and control its progress.\nWhen referring to a project, it is necessary to understand its exact meaning. The definition listed earlier states that a project is a temporary endeavor that has a start and a finish. An example of a simple project would be to paint the floor in a lubricant storage and handling room. A program, however, is a group of coordinated projects, managed to achieve benefits or results not available from managing these projects individually. A plant-wide lubrication program falls into this category.\nAdditionally, going one step above programs is the portfolio. A portfolio is a collection of projects or programs that are grouped together and may or may not be dependent on one another, or even related. The portfolio represents an organization\'s set of active programs or projects at a specific point in time.\nProjects at any level and at any magnitude require careful planning to ensure success. A component of planning is preparing for risk and managing this risk if it occurs. Up to 80 percent of project risk comes from human resources; therefore, it\'s important for this risk to be adequately factored when planning projects.\nProject risk management is a process by which risk is planned to increase the probability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of events harmful to the project.\nAll projects follow a similar path:\nExecution and control\nProject initiation defines and authorizes the project. It is made up of two elements, the project charter and the preliminary scope statement. Project charters act as a contract between parties and are necessary to document and identify the business needs of the service required to satisfy all parties involved.\nThe charter authorizes the project and outlines the benefits, as well as provides project justification, lists key constraints such as time and cost, and describes the responsibilities of the involved parties. The preliminary scope statement is a highly defined document that not only lists the project definition, key deliverables, constraints and driving factors, resources, risks and stakeholders, but it also defines what is not included in the project.\nIt is important for the project scope to list what is not included in the project. For instance, if you are developing a plan to implement oil analysis on equipment with high criticality, a statement that clearly identifies equipment with low criticality must also be noted.\nProject planning is perhaps the most crucial component of project management, but it often mistakenly achieves the status of low importance. The phrase ""less talk, more action"" can be one motivator that cuts the planning stage short. Planning encapsulates the project management plan, the kick-off, defining the work, detailed planning, developing a project schedule, establishing a budget and setting a project baseline.\nEvery component of project planning is critical to the success of any project. Any client (internal or external), regardless of the project, likes to be well informed. Project planning provides a necessary direction for how the project is going to be executed.\nA critical step in planning is to be aware of the driving factors of the project. These are made up of cost, scope and time, with each of these factors varying in relative priority. The relative sum of these factors will always remain constant. As one of these factors increases in value, one or both of the other factors will be reduced.\nOften, the perceived value or priority of one or more of these factors cannot be changed. For example, the allowable cost (budget) for a project may be fixed, or the deadline for completion cannot be moved. If minor modifications need to be planned for an oil analysis project on critical equipment, most of the time modifications to install oil sampling valves require the component to be pulled off-line.\nHowever, an upcoming two-day shutdown will allow for all modifications to be performed at one time without planning for equipment to be down. Due to this time constraint, time as a driving factor is a high priority. This means that either cost or scope may need to change as well. Because the shutdown is looming, the cost to procure and ship appropriate hardware is likely to increase.\nIf cost is not severely limited, the project can proceed as planned. However, if cost has an upper limit that must be adhered to, the only driving factor available that can be changed is scope. To maintain a project completion date at the end of the shutdown and to stay within allowable budget constraints, the scope will need to be adjusted. In this case, an adjustment may result in modifying fewer pieces of equipment at this time.\nThe execution and control phase of a project encompasses kicking off the project, monitoring and control, quality and deliverable acceptance, issues and change management, and finally meetings, reviews and reporting. Although all aspects of the execution and control phase are equally important, the main focus often falls on the deliverable. For a client to accept the deliverable, it must meet his expectations for both quality and scope. Therefore, precise monitoring and control are required.\nDepending on the nature of the project, the project manager will be responsible for monitoring and controlling the project. Some of the factors they may be responsible for could include schedule actuals (start, finish and milestone dates), cost actuals versus budget constraints, and effort and resource actuals. The detail and frequency of monitoring updates should be determined up front with the frequency likely to vary during the project.\nSeveral tools are available that can help the project manager communicate what is being monitored to the client. Performance curves, Gantt charts and any other visual methods are useful to avoid misinterpretation of the data.\nProject close-out may seem like a step in the process that happens only when the work is complete. However, it is important to formally terminate all activities of a project or a project phase and hand off the completed product. Projects that are not formally closed-out will often suffer from ""scope creep.""\nScope creep is what happens when the project continues beyond the original scope for any reason. Additional deliverables, changes, rework or further factors not a part of the original scope of the project can be considered scope creep.\nAll projects are run differently, especially in maintenance when time constraints can play a dramatic role in what gets done and when. It\'s important to consider the formal way to manage projects. Adding formal elements to the project management will not only ensure a successful deliverable, but will also allow projects to run more efficiently.\nA Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, Third Edition. 2004.', 'Project Management Software enables organizations to supervise numerous projects at a time and helps them in project planning, resource allocation, and change management activities.\nAirtable – It is a digital application that motivates people to create the tools they need to accelerate creativity and make their teams more agile.

48	What makes the new C-5M plane better than older versions?	The C-5M Super Galaxy incorporates more than 70 improvements that enhance reliability, efficiency, maintainability and availability. It features new GE F138 turbofan engines that provide 22 percent more thrust than the previous TF39 engines. These improvements result in a 58 percent better climb rate, shorter takeoff roll, enhanced fuel efficiency, and less tanker support demand. The aircraft also meets FAA Stage 4 noise reduction requirements.	['Lockheed Martin delivered the 52nd C-5M Super Galaxy strategic transport modernized under the U.S. Air Force’s Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program (RERP) on August 2 at the company’s Marietta, Georgia, facility.\nThe delivery completes the RERP upgrade, which extends the service life of the C-5 fleet out until the 2040s.\n«With the capability inherent in the C-5M, the Super Galaxy is more efficient and more reliable, and better able to do its job of truly global strategic airlift», said Patricia Pagan, Lockheed Martin Air Mobility and Maritime Missions Strategic Airlift director, «I am very proud of the contractor-government team than carried out the C-5 fleet modernization effort. We’ve worked very hard to ensure the C-5Ms are the absolute best strategic airlifters possible for our armed forces».\nAn Air Force Reserve Command aircrew from the 439th Airlift Wing at Westover Air Reserve Base, Massachusetts, ferried the final C-5M Super Galaxy to Stewart Air Force Base, New York, where the aircraft will undergo interior paint restoration. Once that work is complete, the aircraft will be flown to Westover where it will be the eighth C-5M Super Galaxy assigned to the base.\nLockheed Martin began RERP development work in 2001. RERP incorporates more than 70 improvements that improve reliability, efficiency, maintainability and availability. RERP included changes or modifications to the airframe structure; environmental and pneumatic systems; hydraulic systems, electrical system; fuel system; landing gear; and flight controls.\nThe heart of the system is the GE F138 turbofan engine (known as a CF6-80C2L1F in the commercial world) de-rated to 50,000 pounds/22,680 kg of thrust on the C-5M Super Galaxy. This engine provides 22 percent more thrust than the out-of-production TF39 turbofans on the earlier C-5A/B/C aircraft. The engines also allow the C-5M Super Galaxy to meet the FAA’s (Federal Aviation Administration) Stage 4 noise reduction requirements.\nThese changes, taken together, result in a 22 percent increase in thrust, a shorter takeoff roll; a 58 percent improvement in climb rate; allows the C-5M Super Galaxy to cruise – at maximum gross weight – in the Communication/Navigation/Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) flight environment; and greatly enhanced fuel efficiency and less tanker support demand.\nFirst flight of a modified aircraft to the C-5M Super Galaxy standard came in Marietta, Georgia, on June 19, 2006. The first operational C-5M Super Galaxy was delivered to Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, on February 9, 2009. A total of 49 C 5Bs, two C-5C aircraft, and one original C-5A was modified under RERP.\nThe C-5M Super Galaxy holds 89 FAI-certified (Fédération Aéronautique Internationale) world aviation records, the most by any aircraft type. These records include time-to-climb with payload, altitude with payload, and greatest payload carried.\nThe C-5 Galaxy has been operated solely by the U.S. Air Force since 1970 and is the largest strategic airlifter in the U.S. Air Force’s fleet. The C-5 Galaxy is capable of carrying two 78-ton M1A1 main battle tanks or helicopters and other large equipment intercontinental distances. Fully loaded, a C-5 Galaxy has a gross weight of more than 800,000 pounds/362,874 kg. All of the C-5s were built at Lockheed Martin’s Marietta site.\nIn addition to Westover, C-5Ms are assigned to active duty and Air Force Reserve Command units at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware (436th and 512th Airlift Wings) and Travis Air Force Base, California (60th and 349th Air Mobility Wings). The C-5 aircrew training squadron is part of the 433rd Airlift Wing, the Reserve wing at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas.\nC-5M Super Galaxy\nThe C-5M Super Galaxy aircraft is a game changer to the warfighter and America’s premier global direct delivery weapons system. It is also the Air Force’s only true strategic airlifter. While setting 86 world records in airlift, the C-5M Super Galaxy established new benchmarks in carrying more cargo faster and farther than any other airlifter.\nA venerable workhorse, the recognized improvements in performance, efficiency and safety it provides validate the tremendous value to the taxpayer in modernizing proven and viable aircraft. As the only strategic airlifter with the capability of carrying 100 percent of certified air-transportable cargo, the C-5M Super Galaxy can carry twice the cargo of other strategic airlift systems. The C-5M Super Galaxy also has a dedicated passenger compartment, carrying troops and their supplies straight to the theater. It can be loaded from the front and back simultaneously, and vehicles can also be driven directly on or off the Galaxy. This means the C-5M Super Galaxy can be loaded quickly and efficiently.\nThe C-5M Super Galaxy has been a vital element of strategic airlift in every major contingency and humanitarian relief effort since it entered service. The C-5M Super Galaxy is the only strategic airlifter capable of linking America directly to the warfighter in all theatres of combat with mission capable rates excess of 80 percent. With more than half of its useful structural life remaining, the C-5M Super Galaxy will be a force multiplier through 2040 and beyond.\n|Primary Function||Outsize cargo transport|\n|Prime Contractor||Lockheed-Georgia Co.|\n|Crew||Seven: pilot, co-pilot, 2 flight engineers and 3 loadmasters|\n|Length||247.8 feet/75.53 m|\n|Height||65.1 feet/19.84 m|\n|Wingspan||222.8 feet/67.91 m|\n|Power Plant||4 × General Electric CF6-80C2 turbofans|\n|Thrust||50,580 lbs/22,942.7 kgf/225 kN|\n|Normal cruise speed||Mach 0.77/518 mph/834 km/h|\n|Unrefueled Range with 120,000 lbs/54,431 kg||5,250 NM/9,723 km|\n|Max takeoff weight (2.2 g)||840,000 lbs/381,018 kg|\n|Operating weight||400,000 lbs/181,437 kg|\n|Fuel capacity||332,500 lbs/150,819 kg|\n|Max payload (2.0 g)||285,000 lbs/129,274 kg|\n|Length||143.7 feet/43.8 m|\n|Width||19 feet/5.79 m|\n|Height||13.48 feet/4.11 m|\n|Unit Cost||$90 million (fiscal 2009 constant dollars)|\n|16 C-5Ms have been delivered through December 2013|\n|52 C-5Ms are scheduled to be in the inventory by fiscal 2017|']	['<urn:uuid:5debac80-67c2-4668-8a62-4b4c09511056>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	10	65	927
49	what happened devahuti body after enlightenment	Devahuti's mortal body was transformed into a river through Yoga. This river became prominent among many rivers, blessed with siddhis and frequented by Siddhas.	['by G. V. Tagare | 1950 | ISBN-10: 8120838203 | ISBN-13: 9788120838208\nThis page describes Devahuti’s Enlightenment and Liberation which is chapter 33 of the English translation of the Bhagavata Purana, one of the eighteen major puranas containing roughly 18,000 metrical verses. Topics include ancient Indian history, religion, philosophy, geography, mythology, etc. The text has been interpreted by various schools of philosophy. This is the thirty-third chapter of the Third Skandha of the Bhagavatapurana.\n1. Having heard the discourse of Kapila, his mother Devahūti, the (beloved) wife of Kardama, got her veil of delusion torn open. She bowed to him and praised him who was the founder (lit. land) of the Sāṃkhya (system of philosophy) which is mainly characterised by the topic—treatment of Tattvas (principles).\n2. Even god Brahmā himself who was born of the lotus in your stomach (could not see your body but mentally) meditated upon your person which was lying manifest in the cosmic waters; which was the cause of the entire universe; which consisted of bhūtas (elements), sense-organs and their objects (e.g. fragrance, taste etc.), and the mind, and which has the flow (Sattva, Rajas, Tamas) in it.\n3. It is with your power divided by the flow of your guṇas that you (of above description), remaining inactive, bring about the creation, maintenance and destruction of the universe; Your will power is effective; You are the controller of all the jīvas (for whose enjoyment you create the universe; Your powers are infinite and beyond comprehension.\n4. Oh Lord, how was it possible that you were borne by me in my womb. It was your Māyā, you in whose stomach lay the whole of the universe, and who, at the end of Yugas (i.e. after the deluge set in) lay alone on a banyan leaf in the form of an infant sucking its toe.\n5. Oh Supreme Lord, you have assumed the corporeal form for the destruction of the wicked sinners and for the prosperity of those who obey your commands. Just as you have your (other) incarnations of Boar etc., this incarnation (of yours) is for showing the path of self-realization.\n6. Oh glorious Lord, even a Cāṇḍāla (lit. a dog-eater) immediately becomes worthy (like a performer) of the Soma Sacrifice, if he has but once heard or uttered your name or bowed to you or remembered you. What need be said of a person (like me) who has (directly) seen you?\n7. Oh how wonderful it is that even a Cāṇḍāla (the lowest-born person) becomes superior and worthy of respect simply because Your name is on the tip of his tongue. Those persons of noble behaviour who take your name have (the merit of having) performed penance, sacrifices and baths in holy waters, and Vedic studies (Or: It is as a result of doing these meritorious acts in the previous life that they take your name in this birth).\n8. I pay obeisance to you, Kapila, who are the highest Brahman, the Supreme Man who are worthy of meditation in mind which is withdrawn from external objects, and who have dried up the flow of guṇas by your brilliance and who are Viṣṇu (who holds Vedas within him).\n9. The Supreme Man called the venerable Kapila who was thus praised and who was affectionate to his mother, spoke thus to her in words deep insignificance (Or: with words choked up with emotions.).\n10. Oh mother, I have explained to you the path which is easy to follow. By following this path, you will reach the highest stage (of being liberated while alive).\n11. Have faith in my doctrine which has been followed by the knowers of Brahman (or the Vedas). By following this you will attain to me who am without birth (i.e. eternal). Those who are ignorant about this path go to death (saṃsāra).\n12. The venerable Kapila showed to his pious mother the path leading to Ātman. Having obtained the permission of his mother, who realized the Brahman, Kapila departed (from her hermitage).\n14. She performed ablutions three times a day. Her curly hair became matted and tawny in colour. By severe penance her body became emaciated. She wore bark-garments.\n16. The beds were white and soft like the foam of milk. The ivory couches were chased with gold. The seats of gold were provided with soft cushions (covers).\n17. In the walls of transparent crystals and very costly emeralds were shining jewel-lamps along with statues of beautiful damsels made of precious stones.\n18. The garden around the house looked beautiful with many blossoming celestial trees, on which couples of birds were warbling and the intoxicated black bees were humming sweetly.\n19. Where the followers of gods (Gandharvas) used to praise her when she, fondled by Kardama, entered in the swimming pool fragrant with lotuses.\n21. As her husband left for the forest (after renouncing the world) Devahūti, though she realized the Truth (the Sāṃkhya Principles), became overanxious due to the separation from her son, like a calf-loving cow is fond after her young one.\n23.According to the guide-lines given by her son, she meditated upon the form of the gracious-looking Lord—the object of meditation—by the method of contemplating the complete form followed by concentration on the parts of it.\n25.Her mind became pure. She was then lost in the meditation of all-pervading Atman who by his essential light removes the limitations of the guṇas of Māyā.\n26.Her mind became steadied in the glorious Brahman which is the shelter of all the jīvas. As she superseded her state of being a jīva, all her afflictions were over and she attained to the blessed stage.\n27.As she was always engaged in continuous meditation and her delusion due to guṇas was dispelled, at that time she did not remember her body, just as an object seen in a dream (is found to be unreal) after waking up.\n28. Her body was fed by others (viz. Vidyādhara damsels who were produced by Kardama for attendance upon her). As she was free from diseases, she did not become emaciated. Her body was covered with filth. She looked like a fire covered with smoke.\n29. Her mind was so deeply entered (i.e. absorbed) in Vāsudeva that she was not conscious of her body. She had so completely given herself up to penance and Yoga that her hair fell dishevelled and clothes were dropped aṇd she was protected by her previous karma (daiva).\n32. Oh gentle Vidura, her mortal body from which impurities were eliminated by Yoga, was transformed into a river, a prominent one among many rivers. It blesses one with siddhis and is resorted to by Siddhas.\n33. Even glorious Kapila, the great Yogin, obtained the permission of his mother to depart from his father’s hermitage and proceeded to the northern direction.\n34. He was praised by multitude of Siddhas, Cāraṇas, Gandharvas, sages and celestial nymphs. He was also respectfully received by the sea and was presented a valuable dwelling place.\n35. Kapila stays there practising Yoga. He is highly eulogized by the great teachers of Sāṃkhya School. For the peace and tranquillity of the three worlds, he lives there (absorbed) in meditation.\n36. Oh child (Vidura), as per your query I have narrated to you the sacred dialogue between Kapila and Deva- hūti, Oh sinless one.\n37. He who listens to this or narrates this doctrine of the Sage Kapila regarding the secret knowledge about the Ātman, becomes able to concentrate his mind upon the venerable Lord whose banner has the emblem of Garuḍa, and he attains to the lotus-like feet of the glorious Lord.\nFootnotes and references:\n(ii) Kapila was the supporter of Brahmā and other numerous Śiddhas who are devoted to the Tattva, viz., Viṣṇu.—Padaratnāvalī\n(iii) Kapila is so called because he was the past master in the Bhakti- tattva, Sāṃkhya-System, Yoga-tattva etc.—VC.\n(v) Kapila was the preceptor of Siddhas who are characterised by the knowledge of Tattvas, viz., Prakṛti, Puruṣa, Īśvara etc.—Bālaprabodhini\nVide Supra III. 28.12-33.']	['<urn:uuid:12b87b2f-68c9-4388-91dd-cf8501ae8d26>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	6	24	1333
50	How do rakes serve multiple purposes in landscaping, and what preventive maintenance steps are needed to ensure their longevity?	Rakes serve as versatile landscaping tools, being the quietest and healthiest way to remove dead leaves compared to noisy leaf blowers that require maintenance. Beyond leaf removal, rakes are useful for evenly spreading mulch or straw on large beds, covering new cultivation methods, and clearing small stones and debris from beds before planting. To maintain rakes and ensure their longevity, they require regular cleaning to remove dirt and debris using pressurized water or a wire brush with soapy water. If rust appears, it can be removed by spraying the tool with vinegar, wrapping it in a paper towel and plastic for 3-24 hours, then scrubbing with a baking soda solution. The tool should be sanitized with a 10% bleach solution, thoroughly dried, and oiled to prevent rust. Proper storage in an upright or hanging position is also essential for preservation.	"['Do you do occasional landscaping projects on your home? If so, you should have some basic home landscaping tools to help you make work easier. Such landscaping tools should meet the basic needs of your property, whether it’s extra leaves that need to be cultivated in the fall or difficult-to-cultivate soil. Although many gardening and landscaping tools are sold on the market, gardeners at home or leisure need only a few standard items.\nFor landscape architects who love their own hands, the right tools are essential. Honestly, if a person needs to save on the costs associated with developing a beautiful garden landscape, it’s best to make sure that the person has every equipment needed to start building a beautiful landscape. Just by knowing the most versatile equipment for basic landscaping needs, you can be sure you have everything you need to keep your lawns and gardens in the absolute best condition, whether they are large or small, will give you opportunities for joy and improvement or small. With these tools that make home landscaping much easier you can easily do most of the yard work you need.\nSetting Your Yard Up To Keep Your Dog Safe: https://t.co/MCKuuPlGIb— Cammond (@Cammond4) June 13, 2022\nThe shovel is the king of landscape tools. How can we dig a hole without a shovel? Most homes require a full-sized shovel, but for people with only a small yard or a terraced garden, a hand shovel is sufficient. A shovel makes shallow ridges available for small seeds and holes for planted trees.\nFor people with yards over a few square feet, a wheelbarrow is another necessary landscape tool. With a wheelbarrow, everything becomes easier from moving rocks to sloping leaves. There seems to be a lot of wheelbarrows bought in the yard, but you will be very happy when needed. When not in use, store it upside down in a garage or tarpaulin.\nA rake is the best, quietest and healthiest way to remove dead leaves. Leaf blowers breathe, play, and disturb their neighbors, requiring maintenance. But raking is not just for dead leaves. Use it to spread out many or straws evenly on a large bed. Use it to cover new cultivation methods. And use it to rake small stones and debris from the bed ready for new plants.\nTrimming and trimming are important chores in every yard. At some point, you will need to trim branches of shrubs, trim overgrown plants,s or cut flowers for your house. Take a small hand-held trimmer; they can trim things up to an inch in diameter. There are other landscape tools for trimming and cutting, such as scissors and saws. But for most simple home gardening, larger tools are not needed.\nIn some places, garden pipes are not accessible. Maybe you don’t even have a garden hose. Watering cans are absolutely required for container factories and newly planted specimens. These guys need special care, including regular watering. Always use a watering can, and the crusher on the watering can keep the water gently on the plants.\nThis is perhaps one of the most basic and obvious beautification tools. It is designed to keep your lawn at a reasonable level and keep the vegetation neat and in perfect shape. Associated with lawnmowers in the trimming department are usually things such as weed thumps, which are very helpful in keeping sides that are usually not trimmed by the lawnmower. In addition, using a special machine to remove heavy brushes is convenient even if you only rent one device per year.\nWhen you have every tool that is important to the beautification of the environment, then you will definitely be rewarded for perseverance. Having more commonly used tools can ultimately help you save money because you can use them over and over again. Moreover, the proportions of many of the more common landscape tools and equipment are often quite compact and easy to store in storage areas or garden sheds. As long as you keep them in the right place, you can find them more easily when you need them, rather than hard to find them. Proper maintenance of all equipment is critical: prevent them from being corroded, and make sure that the lawnmower and other gas or electrical accessories are well oiled and always full of fuel. Taking care of your personal equipment means taking care of your yard.', ""- Author: Hannah Meyer\n- Editor: Cindy Fake\nSadly, there are a lot of dull, rusted tools out there, even on productive farms. If you watch the videos at the end of this post, you will hear “Rust is always a sign of neglect” so let this be the end of neglect. Put your tools “to bed for the winter,” or prepare them for pruning season, right around the corner.\nThere are three main parts of tool maintenance: clean, sharpen, and lubricate. These three steps should simply be done, in that order, every single time a tool is put back in the shed. The more often you do it, the easier and more effective it is at improving the lifespan of your tools.\nClean: There are three steps - cleaning off debris, removing rust, and sanitizing to prevent the transfer of disease. Proper cleaning may require removing screws and partially dismantling the tool.\nClean – Pressurized water, or a wire brush and a little soapy water are effective when used to scrub off all dirt and debris from your tool.\nRust? – Sometimes, especially if your tools have not been constantly maintained properly, you may see a rusted tool that just isn't what it used to be. Don't worry, if you have this problem, there are some easy tips that can help take that rust off. Spray the tool with vinegar, wrap in a paper towel and cover in plastic for about three hours, up to 24 hours. Remove the paper towel and plastic. Use a brush, an old toothbrush works just fine on small projects, put some baking soda in water and use the brush to scrub off the rust. Turpentine and steel wool also work well. After you scrub the tool to remove the rust, rinse thoroughly with water.\nSanitize – To ensure your tools are not going to spread disease around your farm, sanitation is important. Wipe down the tool surface with a 10% bleach solution (10 parts water to 1 part bleach), leave it for 30 seconds and then rinse thoroughly with water. Be sure to dry and oil your tool after sanitizing to be sure it does not rust from the bleach! Learn how below.\nSharpen: Many tools, even though you may not think of them as having a blade, actually require frequent sharpening to ensure their consistent function. A shovel, for instance, needs sharpening on the edge, which helps cut through roots, make clean holes, among other things. The basic method of sharpening is pretty simple. Use caution when sharpening and be sure to wear the proper protective equipment, such as gloves and eye protection.\nStabilize – Small tools, such as hand pruning shears, may easily be held firmly with the non-dominant hand. Larger tools, such as mower blades, or loppers, may need to be held in a vise.\nSharpen - Locate the proper edges to sharpen. Remember that there is a cutting blade and a bypass edge on some tools like pruning shears. You only need to sharpen the blade. A file can be used and should only be pushed in one direction. Hold the file at an angle, usually 45 degrees to the blade. Be sure to lubricate the blade and properly tighten screws after sharpening.\nIf you would like to pay a professional to sharpen your tools, at our January 9th Farmer-to-Farmer Breakfast, Ruben with Sharpening Tech will available to sharpen tools. Watch for an announcement on the Foothill Farming Calendar.\nLubricate: It is very important to oil your tools, even if they do not need to be sharpened. Oil helps keep the rust at bay. If your tool comes in contact with food crops or soil, we recommend a plant-based oil, like linseed oil for wood handles, and vegetable oil for pruners and shovels. This should happen each time your tools are put away. A barrel or bucket with sand and a small amount of oil left near your tool shed will work. Simply stabbing the tool in and out of the sand mixture can remove debris and oil the tool at the same time.\nStore your tools standing upright or hanging, this also helps prevent rust. Develop a system to maintain your tools and always have them in their correct place so that anyone working in your operation can find the right tool anytime. Livestock Advisor Dan Macon has developed a system of sharpening his tools and oiling all the handles on New Year's Eve each year. He also prepared a lambing box, and outfits it with sufficient supplies and freshly sharpened tools each year before lambing season.

"['The Beautiful Game - Social Change Through the Power of Football\nIn many parts of the world sporting activities, especially football, are now being incorporated into a variety of programmes geared toward helping youth address a broad range of issues affecting their lives. These include children\'s rights & education, health promotion, peace promotion, anti-discrimination & social integration, and the environment. By emphasizing a ""team"" approach, these programmes help impart the skills needed by the next generation to overcome the many challenges faced by their countries, from poverty to HIV/AIDS, malnutrition to low educational access.\nBy creating a space for gathering we can create social change through the power of football.\nYou are challenged to work in interdisciplinary design teams of five to develop an anchor within the lives of a community by designing a sustainable youth led football facility in a context where formal resources are severely constrained, and basic conditions for human development are challenged.\nAs a community service point this facility will bring in services often overlooked including access to water, energy/power, IT/technology and sanitation. The facility must also incorporate a structure to house existing youth programs and health education.\nMoreover you are tasked to create a holistic program that includes a new graphical identity for the team, including home and away strip. It is important that issues of HIV/AIDS awareness are incorporated into this as the client uses football to help tackle this pandemic in the areas’ youth. This new identity should be apart of an over all strategy to create a self-sustaining model that incorporates novel approaches to income generation.\nYou will have approximately 3 days to develop a conceptual design and sustainability plan that will be then presented to the clients. This project has a real client and real community. While the workshop is to try and push your boundaries of design, remember that for the end users a sustainable solution is the only solution to create long-term change.\nFinally remember the most important aspect of design, creating joy including your own.\nGrassroot Soccer (GRS), Zambia\nGRS was founded by professional football players as a project aimed at mobilising the global football community in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The organization trains local role models (including professional football players) to deliver an interactive, football-themed behaviour development curriculum to young people, who are then empowered as peer educators to teach the community at large what they have learned. GRS runs its flagship projects in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Zambia and partners organizations in several other African countries.\nThe community centre and the small-size football pitch will serve an average of 250-300 (up to 1000) children and youth and a staff of 10 to 30 persons daily.\nTimeline for Construction:\n3 to 4 months\nTeams are challenged to design a small-size pitch (20m x 40m) with surrounding space for spectators (e.g. seating on elevated ground, etc.) as well as classrooms and media, health, conference and educational facilities that can offer young Africans the chance to further their scholastic and sporting education while providing health and social services. The centre will be located on the site of an existing local community partner, strengthening their activities in the community in order to improve basic education, prevent diseases and promote health as well as encourage the social integration of minorities and disadvantaged populations.\nYou are also charged to create a marketing and sustainability plan for the organization as well as updated graphical identity.\nTeams are challenged to incorporate the needs of the community and to employ sustainable and/or local building materials and construction methods to realize their design. There is the potential to create shared services to the community at large, including access to water, power and other support services.\nThe artificial turf for the football pitch will be freighted to the site in two standardized shipping containers and are free to be utilized in the design if the design teams so choose.\nPoints to be taken into consideration in the concept phase: future prospect of this centre, expanding in terms of capacity and infrastructure, creating a self-sustaining model for the host community group and becoming development hubs for the training of social entrepreneurs.\n- Size: Length 40 m and Width 20 m\n- Surface: artificial turf, green\n- Orientation: Preferred orientation of the field is with the goals facing N.N.W. and S.S.E.\n- Goal: Placed in the middle of the goal line; Width 3 m between the goalposts; 2 m height (between crossbar and the ground); Goal posts 8 cm; Nets, made of hemp, jute or nylon; Depth of the goal shall be at least 80 cm at the top and 1 m at ground level; Goal placed solid in the ground.\n- Boarding: Option between solid boarding or fence boarding. Approximately 1m high.\n- Classroom/Conference room (capacity:100)\n- Basic Health Care Facilities (capacity:100)\n- Internet Cafe\n- Common Space for larger gatherings\n- Office for staff members\n- Reception area\n- Two toilet blocks (boys and girls)\n- Rainwater catchment and management system\n- Grandstand style seating around pitch (e.g. seating on elevated ground)\n- Entrance Area and perimeter fencing\n- Parking (for 3-5 vehicles inc. 2 mini-bus/vans)\n- Integration in the local landscape requested\n- Use of local materials and local community involvement requested\nThe centre should be designed in a way that future expansion is possible. The idea is that the basic unit, as described above, develops over the years in regional development hubs/sustainable business. You are not limited to just a football centre but this will be the defining anchor of this project.\nTotal Construction Budget: USD 85,000\nSoccer Tournament During Workshop']"	['<urn:uuid:60c64245-bec6-4a09-bc2f-0280b856804f>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	12	13	936
52	Why do directors use the pseudonym Alan Smithee in movies?	The pseudonym 'Alan Smithee' was invented by the Directors Guild for directors who are so unsatisfied with a studio or producer's interference with their film that they feel it no longer reflects their creative vision. This pseudonym was first used in the 1969 film Death of a Gunfighter and has been used dozens of times since then.	"['According to recent reviews of Steven Soderbergh\'s new movie The Good German, Soderbergh uses the pseudonym Peter Andrews for his work as cinematographer on his films, and the name Mary Ann Bernard for his work as a film editor. Why do filmmakers use pseudonyms to conceal their involvement in a film?\nTypically, pseudonyms are a product of the Byzantine rules that govern how credits appear in movies. As part of their contracts with the major studios, each of the various Hollywood labor groups (the Directors Guild of America, the Writers Guild of America, the International Cinematographers Guild, etc.) have strict rules that govern how their members are credited on screen.\nBut sometimes those rules conflict with filmmakers\' preferences. ""My policy is to have my name on a movie only once,"" Soderbergh says. ""Having your name once increases the impact of that credit because I think every time you put your name up there, you\'re actually diluting it.""\nFor his movie Traffic, he proposed that the credit read, ""Directed and Photographed by Steven Soderbergh."" While the directors and cinematographers guilds both signed off on Soderbergh\'s proposal, the Writers Guild would not, since its rules say no other credits can appear between the writer and director credit, and Soderbergh\'s ""directed and photographed by"" solution would break that rule.\nSoderbergh\'s solution? The pseudonym Peter Andrews—his father\'s first and middle names. A couple of years later, as his film Solaris wrapped up, Soderbergh encountered a similar issue with his film editor credit. Here, he opted for the pseudonym Mary Ann Bernard, based on his mother\'s name. ""I wanted to pay tribute to my dad, and so when the editing credit became an issue on Solaris, I decided to spread it around,"" he says.\nSoderbergh is hardly alone in his use of pseudonyms. When Joel and Ethan Coen edit their movies, they use the pseudonym Roderick Jaynes so as not to highlight their names too many times. Though the brothers work as a team, their standard credit sequence is for Joel to take director, Ethan to take producer, and for both to share the writing credit.\n""Alan Smithee"" is probably the most famous pseudonym, invented by the Directors Guild for directors who are so unsatisfied with a studio or producer\'s meddling with their film that they don\'t think it reflects their creative vision anymore. The first movie to use it was Death of a Gunfighter in 1969, and it has since been used dozens of times.\nPseudonyms are generally trouble-free, but they can create headaches around awards season. The Academy issues Oscar nominations to whoever is officially listed in a film\'s credits, pseudonym or not. In 1997, Jaynes became an Oscar-nominated film editor for ""his"" work on Fargo. Likewise, Donald Kaufman, the fictional alter-ego of Charlie Kaufman who shared writing credit on 2002\'s Adaptation, was nominated for best adapted screenplay.\nThe academy mostly leaves it up to Oscar nominees and winners to correct its records. This used to be an issue for writers who were blacklisted during the McCarthy era and couldn\'t work under their own names. For instance, Dalton Trumbo won two Oscars under other names, once in 1954 for Roman Holiday as Ian McLellan Hunter, and then again in 1957 for The Brave One as Robert Rich. * While Trumbo had chosen to assume the identities of two different real people for those credits, and did not accept the awards himself, he eventually received both Oscars—for The Brave One in 1975, one year before he died, and for Roman Holiday in 1992. *\nGot a question about today\'s news? Ask the Explainer.\nCorrections, March 5, 2010: This article originally referred to Ian McLellan Hunter as Ian McCullen Hunter. It also stated that Robert Rich accepted an Oscar on Trumbo\'s behalf in 1957. In fact, that award went unclaimed for a number of years.

53	atlantic pacific hurricanes which worse	Both the North Atlantic and Pacific regions experience significant hurricane activity, but the Northwest Pacific is actually the most active basin, accounting for one-third of all tropical cyclone activity with an average of 25.7 tropical cyclones annually. In comparison, the North Atlantic averages 11 named storms per season. The Northeastern Pacific is the second most active basin globally with 15-16 tropical storms annually. Recent years have shown increased activity in both basins - the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was hyperactive with 17 named storms, while the Pacific has seen storms of increasing intensity, with some super-typhoons having gusts over 200 knots.	"['Weather patterns and ocean currents are changing. Cruising legend Jimmy Cornell shares his insights on a period of climate change flux, and what it all means for sailors\nThe recently published report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a challenge to the international community to unite in its efforts to bring climate change under control by limiting the increase in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees. Based on more than 6,000 scientific studies, the report was compiled by the world’s top climate scientists, its irrefutable conclusion is that the astonishing pace of global warming is the ‘greatest challenge of our generation’ and its message is relevant to every human being on our planet.\nMuch has been written about this phenomenon and few sailors would disagree that global weather conditions are undergoing a radical change. The warming of the climate system is unequivocal: the atmosphere and oceans have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea levels are rising, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased.\nSome of the changes have become increasingly evident:\n1) The Arctic ice cap is melting at a faster rate than in any recorded time.\n2) Coral is dying due to the oceans getting warmer.\n3) The Gulf Stream is slowing down.\n4) Extra-seasonal tropical storms are more common.\n5) The tropical storm seasons themselves are less clearly defined and becoming more active.\n6) Tropical storms have affected areas where they had never occurred before.\nThe facts speak for themselves. Over the last three years the hurricane seasons in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific have been unusually active. In the North Atlantic the 2017 hurricane season was hyperactive and extremely destructive, featuring 17 named storms, and ranked as one of the most active seasons since records began in 1851. Ten of the season’s hurricanes occurred in a row, the greatest number of consecutive hurricanes in the satellite era, and the largest number of consecutive hurricanes ever observed in the Atlantic basin. The tropical storm season started on 20 April with Arlene. It was followed by tropical storm Bret, which struck the island of Trinidad on 20 June, the first hurricane to directly affect that island since 1933. In late September, Maria became the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the island of Dominica causing widespread devastation. In early October, Nate became the first hurricane to strike Panama and Costa Rica. One week later, Ophelia became the easternmost major hurricane in the Atlantic basin on record, and later impacted most of Western Europe as an extra-tropical cyclone.\nThe 2018 North Atlantic hurricane season has been just as active, with the formation of tropical storm Alberto on 25 May marking the fourth consecutive year in which a storm developed before the official start of the season. The next storm, Beryl, became the first hurricane to form in the Eastern Atlantic during the month of July since Bertha in 2008.\nOn 5 September Florence was the first major hurricane of the season and caused major flooding in North and South Carolina. Hurricane Joyce formed on 12 September making 2018 the first season since 2008 to feature four named storms active simultaneously (Florence, Helene, Isaac, Joyce). Hurricane Michael followed on 10 October and caused widespread devastation in Cuba, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas.\nThe situation in the North Pacific was just as dire. In the 2016 Eastern Pacific season hurricane Pali occurred from January 7 to 15 and marked the earliest formation of a tropical cyclone in the Eastern North Pacific. Pali reached a minimum latitude of 2.0°N, making it the lowest latitude tropical cyclone on record. In the 2017 hurricane season tropical storm Adrian occurred on 10 May as the first hurricane of the season. It was also the earliest-known tropical storm in the Eastern Pacific since the advent of satellite imagery. The last of the season was tropical storm Selma on 27 October. This marked only the second time that an Eastern Pacific tropical cyclone became a tropical storm east of 90° W. Selma affected Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and was the first to also affect El Salvador.\nIn the Northwest Pacific both the frequency and force of typhoons is on the increase, with some super-typhoons having gusts of 200 knots or more. On 15 September 2018 super-typhoon Mangkhut struck the Philippines as a category 5 tropical storm, one of the strongest ever recorded. It continued its destructive path towards Hong Kong and Southern China. In recent years tropical storms have been recorded in the Northwest Pacific in every month of the year, with a well-defined safe season now sadly a thing of the past.\nIn the South Pacific the cyclone season (November to April) now lasts longer than in the past, and in the Coral Sea extra-seasonal cyclones have been recorded as late as June and even July. A late season and unusually strong tropical cyclone formed in the Southwest Pacific Ocean in early May 2017, striking the island nations of Vanuatu and New Caledonia. Cyclone Donna was the strongest May cyclone on record for the entire Southern Hemisphere.\nThere should no longer be any doubt that all this points to the warming of the oceans. And yet, despite all the evidence, there are still people who refuse to accept that climate change is a result of human activity, insisting that it is a cyclic phenomenon that has occurred repeatedly in the history of the planet. This argument is often raised when I discuss this subject at my seminars on voyage planning. My answer is always the same: as far as we sailors are concerned, climate change is happening, and whether it is the result of human activity or a natural phenomenon is no longer a relevant argument. What really matters is that global weather conditions are changing.\nMy personal concern for the state of the oceans has been supported by my own observations during over four decades of roaming the oceans of the world. A prime example of the disastrous effects of climate change is that of Tuvalu, the small South Pacific island nation, which is facing the threat of disappearing before the end of this century, but possibly much sooner.\nI have noticed visible changes throughout the world, such as in Antarctica between my two visits there, while in the tropics I witnessed the death of coral reefs, and increasingly the absence of steady trade winds on previously reliable routes. My one-season transit of the Northwest Passage in 2015 was only possible due to climate change.\nLooking at this from the point of view of a sailor, I believe that it is no longer acceptable to deny that there has been a significant change in weather patterns during the last decades, and we have no excuse for not taking notice of what scientists and meteorologists have been saying for many years. These warnings must be taken seriously as they affect sailors perhaps more than anyone else, so we need to heed them and be even more cautious when planning a voyage.\nMy direct interest in this phenomenon goes back to 1997 when I organised a round the world rally to raise awareness of the state of the oceans. To commemorate the 500th anniversary of the voyage of Vasco da Gama around the Cape of Good Hope and on to India, Portugal decided to organise in 1998 a world exhibition in Lisbon. Its theme was ‘The oceans, a heritage for the future’, a message that our rally carried around the world. Fifteen years later, with climate change becoming increasingly an undeniable reality, in 2013 I launched another round the world rally with a similar but stronger message ‘The ocean, our future’. Participants in the rally contributed to various oceanographic projects on climate change by deploying research buoys along the route.\nOne important thing to note about these Argo buoys is that the protective cardboard packaging will disintegrate in seawater without causing any harm to the environment. It is biodegradable.\nOne of the aims of the Blue Planet Odyssey was to raise awareness of climate change by sailing through the Northwest Passage. This challenging waterway between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans had been described as the ‘canary in the mine’ for global weather because it is believed that any changes that occur in that area have repercussions for weather conditions throughout the world.\nHow do the current changes affect long-term cruising plans?\nLong-term planning is now even more important than in the past. In spite of climate change, tropical storm seasons and critical areas can still be avoided by good planning. A basic rule is to avoid arriving in the tropics too close to the start of the safe season, and allow a safe margin by leaving before its end. This is the option followed by the majority of those who sail from Europe to the Eastern Caribbean for the favourable winter season, and plan to return home, usually via the Azores, by late April or early May.\nThose who decide to remain in the tropics should avoid cruising during the critical period or, if they do, keep an eye on the weather and stay close to shelter. Those who decide to leave the boat unattended, should make sure that their insurance company agrees with their plans as many companies are no longer prepared to insure boats left unattended in the tropics, and some also refuse to provide coverage to those who decide to continue cruising during the critical period.\nThe safest option however, is to leave the tropics during the critical season and cruise in a safer area, something that with good planning is not too difficult to do.\nChanges in the climate mean that extreme weather in on the increase in other areas like the Mediterranean, but they are still safer bets.', 'Tropical cyclone basins\nTraditionally, areas of tropical cyclone formation are divided into seven basins. These include the north Atlantic Ocean, the eastern and western parts of the northern Pacific Ocean, the southwestern Pacific, the southwestern and southeastern Indian Oceans, and the northern Indian Ocean (Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal). The western Pacific is the most active and the north Indian the least active. An average of 86 tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide, with 47 reaching hurricane/typhoon strength, and 20 becoming intense tropical cyclones (at least of Category 3 intensity).\n|Tropical cyclone basins and official warning centre.|\n|Basin||Warning Center||Area of responsibility||Refs|\n|United States National Hurricane Center\nUnited States Central Pacific Hurricane Center\n|Equator northward, African Coast – 140°W\nEquator northward, 140°W-180\n|Western Pacific||Japan Meteorological Agency||Equator-60°N, 180-100°E|||\n|North Indian Ocean||India Meteorological Department||Equator northward, 100°E-45°E|\n|Meteo France Reunion||Equator-40°S, African Coast-90°E|||\n|Australian region||Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika\nPapua New Guinea National Weather Service\nAustralian Bureau of Meteorology\n|Southern Pacific||Fiji Meteorological Service\nMeteorological Service of New Zealand\nNorth Atlantic Ocean\nThis region includes the North Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. Tropical cyclone formation here varies widely from year to year, ranging from one to over twenty-five per year. Most Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes form between June 1 and November 30. The United States National Hurricane Center monitors the basin and issues reports, watches and warnings about tropical weather systems for the Atlantic Basin as one of the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres for tropical cyclones as defined by the World Meteorological Organization. On average, 11 named storms (of tropical storm or higher strength) occur each season, with an average of 6 becoming hurricanes and 2 becoming major hurricanes. The climatological peak of activity is around September 10 each season.\nThe United States Atlantic coast and Gulf Coast, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean Islands, and Bermuda are frequently affected by storms in this basin. Venezuela, the 4 provinces of Atlantic Canada, and Atlantic Macaronesian islands also are occasionally affected. Many of the more intense Atlantic storms are Cape Verde-type hurricanes, which form off the west coast of Africa near the Cape Verde islands. Occasionally, a hurricane that evolves into an extratropical cyclone can reach western Europe, including Hurricane Gordon, which spread high winds across Spain and the British Isles in September 2006. Hurricane Vince, which made landfall on the southwestern coast of Spain as a tropical depression in October 2005, is the only known system to impact mainland Europe as a tropical cyclone (correction/citation needed here to mention 1842 Spain hurricane).\nThe Northeastern Pacific is the second most active basin and has the highest number of storms per unit area. The hurricane season runs between May 15 and November 30 each year, and encompasses the vast majority of tropical cyclone activity in the region. In the 1971–2005 period, there were an average of 15–16 tropical storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4–5 major hurricanes (storms of Category 3 intensity or greater) annually in the basin.\nStorms that form here often affect western Mexico, and less commonly the Continental United States (in particular California), or northern Central America. No hurricane included in the modern database has made landfall in California; however, historical records from 1858 speak of a storm that brought San Diego winds over 75 mph (65 kn; 121 km/h) (marginal hurricane force), though it is not known if the storm actually made landfall. Tropical storms in 1939, 1976 and 1997 brought gale-force winds to California.\nThe Central Pacific Hurricane Center\'s area of responsibility (AOR) begins at the boundary with the National Hurricane Center\' AOR (at 140 °W), and ends at the International Date Line, where the Northwestern Pacific begins. The hurricane season in the North Central Pacific runs annually from June 1 to November 30; The Central Pacific Hurricane Center monitors the storms that develop or move into the defined area of responsibility. The CPHC previously tasked with monitoring tropical activity in the basin was originally known as the Joint Hurricane Warning Center; today it is called the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.\nCentral Pacific hurricanes are rare and on average 4 to 5 storms form or move in this area annually. As there are no large contiguous landmasses in the basin, direct hits and landfalls are rare; however, they occur occasionally, as with Hurricane Iniki in 1992, which made landfall on Hawaii, and Hurricane Ioke in 2006, which made a direct hit on Johnston Atoll.\nNorthwestern Pacific Ocean\nThe Northwest Pacific Ocean is the most active basin on the planet, accounting for one-third of all tropical cyclone activity. Annually, an average of 25.7 tropical cyclones in the basin acquire tropical storm strength or greater; also, an average of 16 typhoons occurred each year during the 1968–1989 period. The basin occupies all the territory north of the equator and west of the International Date Line, including the South China Sea. The basin sees activity year-round; however, tropical activity is at its minimum in February and March.\nTropical storms in this region often affect China, Hong Kong, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam, plus numerous Oceanian islands such as Guam, the Northern Marianas and Palau. Sometimes, tropical storms in this region affect Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand and even Singapore. The coast of China sees the most landfalling tropical cyclones worldwide. The Philippines archipelago receives an average of 6–7 tropical cyclone landfalls per year.\nNorth Indian Ocean\nThis basin is divided into two areas: the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, with the Bay of Bengal dominating (5 to 6 times more activity). Still, this basin is the most inactive worldwide, with only 4 to 6 storms per year. This basin\'s season has a double peak: one in April and May, before the onset of the monsoon, and another in October and November, just after. Although it is an inactive basin, the deadliest tropical cyclones in the world have formed here, including the 1970 Bhola cyclone, which killed 500,000 people. Nations affected include India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, and Pakistan. Rarely do tropical cyclones that form in this basin affect the Arabian Peninsula or Somalia; however, Cyclone Gonu caused heavy damage in Oman on the peninsula in 2007.\nOn rare occasions, tropical-like systems, that can reach the intensity of hurricanes, occur over the Mediterranean Sea. Such a phenomenon is called a Medicane (mediterranean-hurricane). Although the geographical dimensions of tropical oceans and the Mediterranean Sea are clearly different, the precursor mechanisms of these perturbations, based on the air-sea thermodynamic imbalance, are similar. Their origins are typically non-tropical, and develop over open waters under strong, initially cold-core cyclones, similar to subtropical cyclones or anomalous tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Basin, like Karl (1980), Vince (2005), Grace (2009) or Chris (2012). Sea surface temperatures in late-August and early-September are quite high over the basin (24/28 °C or 75/82 °F), though research indicates water temperatures of 20 °C (68 °F) are normally required for development.\nMeteorological literature document that such systems occurred in September 1947, September 1969, January 1982, September 1983, January 1995, October 1996, September 2006, November 2011 and November 2014. The 1995 system developed a well-defined eye, and a ship recorded 85 mph (140 km/h) winds, along with an atmospheric pressure of 975 mbar. Although it had the structure of a tropical cyclone, it occurred over 61 °F (16 °C) water temperatures, suggesting it could have been a polar low.\nWithin the Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclones generally form on a regular basis between the African coast and the middle of the South Pacific. Tropical and Subtropical Cyclones have also been noted occurring in the Southern Atlantic Ocean at times. For various reasons including where tropical cyclones form, there are several different ways to split the area between the American and African coasts. For instance the World Meteorological Organization define three different basins for the tracking and warning of tropical cyclones. These are the South-West Indian Ocean between the African Coast and 90°E, the Australian region between 90°E and 160°E and the South Pacific between 160°E and 120°W. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center also monitors the whole region, but splits it at 135°E into the South Pacific and the Southern Indian Ocean.\nSouth-West Indian Ocean\nThe South-West Indian Ocean is located within the Southern Hemisphere between the Africa\'s east coast and 90°E and is primarily monitored by the Meteo France\'s La Reunion RSMC, while the Mauritian, Australian Indonesian, and Madagascan weather services also monitor parts of it. Until the start of the 1985–86 tropical cyclone season the basin only extended to 80°E, with the 10 degrees between 80 and 90E considered to be a part of the Australian region. On average about 9 cyclones per develop into tropical storms, while 5 of those go on to become tropical cyclones that are equivalent to a hurricane or a typhoon. The tropical cyclones that form in this area can affect some of the various Indian Ocean island nations and or various countries along Africa\'s east coast.\nThrough the middle of 1985, this basin extended westward to 80E. Since then, its western boundary has been 90E. Tropical activity in this region affects Australia and Indonesia. According to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the most frequently hit portion of Australia is between Exmouth and Broome in Western Australia. The basin sees an average of about seven cyclones each year, although more can form or come in from other basins, such as the South Pacific. The tropical cyclone Cyclone Vance in 1999 produced the highest recorded speed winds in an Australian town or city at around 267 km/h (166 mph).\nSouth Pacific Ocean\nThe South Pacific Ocean basin starts at 160°E and extends to 120°W with cyclones developing in it officially monitored by Fiji and New Zealand\'s Meteorological Services. Tropical Cyclones that develop within this basin generally affect countries to the west of the dateline, though during El Niños cyclones have been known to develop to the east of the dateline near French Polynesia. On average the basin sees nine tropical cyclones annually with about half of them becoming severe tropical cyclones.\nSouth Atlantic Ocean\nCyclones rarely form in other tropical ocean areas, which are not formally considered tropical cyclone basins. Tropical depressions and tropical storms occur occasionally in the South Atlantic, and the only full-blown tropical cyclones on record were 2004\'s Hurricane Catarina, which made landfall in Brazil and 2010\'s Tropical Storm Anita, which formed off the coast of Rio Grande do Sul. The South Atlantic Ocean is not officially classified as a tropical cyclone basin by the World Meteorological Organization and does not have a designated regional specialized meteorological center (RSMC). However, the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center has started in 2011 to assign names to tropical and subtropical systems in this basin, when they have sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km/h (40 mph).\n- Chris Landsea.

54	How many maintenance personnel did the city of Rome employ to maintain and protect their aqueduct system during ancient times?	The city of Rome at one time employed about 700 maintenance personnel to maintain and protect their aqueducts.	"['What did the Romans ever do for us? The very fact they still intrigue us should put this question to bed. And in terms of engineering, they did quite a lot. Let\'s take one prime example of revolutionary engineering: Roman aqueducts.\nIf you travel around Europe and the Middle East, you\'ll quickly run into examples of aqueducts. Some are even still completely serviceable. The Trevi Fountain in Rome still gets fed by an ancient aqueduct (even though it\'s now pressurized).\nDid you know?\nMention aqueducts and most people will instinctively think of a large stone bridge, perhaps arched, that carries or once carried water along its course.\nAqueducts are a complex network of ground works, pipes and other structures designed to transfer water from a source to a destination. It\'s not just the iconic stone structures seen today. For the most part, aqueducts transport water long distances simply under the influence of gravity - absolutely simple but ingenious. These are in fact merely conduits to the aqueduct system.\n[ Image Source : Graphics reporting by Tom Kington. Graphic by Doug Stevens/LA Times ]\nThe First Aqueducts\nAqueducts are not unique to Ancient Rome. Many other civilizations developed similar engineering. Crete has early examples of simple water channeling systems from the Minoan period. Egypt and China both had their ""quanats"" to carry water underground. Even ancient Aztec culture had versions of this technology.\nThe first long-distance canal systems were constructed by the Assyrians in the 9th century BC. In the 7th century BC Assyrian king Sennacherib constructed a wide canal with a 920 ft (280 m) long white stone ‘bridge’. This was used to bring water to Nineveh via the Jerwan aqueduct, which is acknowledged as the first large above-ground aqueduct.\nThe Greeks, not to be outdone, built aqueducts to supply Athens, amongst other locations, via long distance aqueduct systems in the 6th century BC.\nWhen in Rome\nBefore aqueducts, Romans relied on local water sources such as springs and streams. These were supplemented by groundwater from privately or publicly owned wells. Seasonal rainwater was also exploited by draining from rooftops into storage jars and cisterns, much like rainwater harvesting today. The reliance of ancient communities on these water resources restricted their potential growth.\nBy the early Imperial era, Rome\'s aqueducts supported a population of over a million. They also supplied extravagant water supply for public amenities such as baths, fountains and latrines.\n[ Image Source: PaperBlog ]\nBefore building an aqueduct, Roman engineers assessed the quality of a potential water source by examining: the water\'s clarity, source rate of flow, and taste of the water. They also took note of the physical condition of the locals who drank it. Once a site was approved, surveyors calculated the right path and gradient for the conduit, as well as its channel size and length.\nSprings served as the most common sources for the aqueduct. However, some aqueducts got water from dammed reservoirs like the two still used in the provincial city of Emerita Augusta. Roman engineers used a number of different tools to plan the aqueduct\'s construction. Horizons were checked using ""chorobates,"" a flat-bedded wooden frame fitted with a water level.\nThe aqueducts themselves ran 0.5 to 1 m beneath the ground\'s surface. While early aqueducts were made from ashlar, late Republic-era Rome used brick-faced concrete for a better seal. Contemporary Roman engineers such as Vitruvius recommended a low gradient of not less than 1 in 4800 for the channel. This was presumably to prevent damage to the structure.\nFailing to plan is planning to fail\nOnce built, aqueducts had to be maintained and protected. The city of Rome at one time employed about 700 maintenance personnel for this purpose. The excellent planning of the ancient Romans ensured that maintenance requirements were incorporated into the design.\nFor instance, underground sections of the aqueducts were made accessible by means of manholes and shafts. When major repairs were needed, engineers could temporarily divert the water away from a damaged section.\nNotable Roman Aqueducts\nThe combined conduit length of the aqueducts in the city of Rome is estimated between 490 to a little over 500 miles. 29 miles (47 km) of which was carried above ground level, on masonry supports. It is estimated that Rome’s aqueducts supplied around 1 million cubic meters (300 million gallons) a day. That\'s a capacity of 126 percent of the current water supply of the city of Bangalore, which has a population of 6 million – amazing!\nThe longest Roman aqueduct system is believed to have been in Constantinople. What\'s known of the aqueduct runs two and a half times longer than the ones found in Carthage and Cologne. Many scholars believe it to be the most outstanding achievement in pre-industrial societies.\nPerhaps the second longest, built in the 2nd Century, the Zaghouan Aqueduct is 57.5 miles (92.5 km) in length.\n[""Aqueduct of Segovia"" courtesy of Bernard Gagnon/Creative Commons ]\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, aqueducts were either deliberately vandalised or fell into disuse through lack of organised maintenance.\nThis was devastating for larger cities. Rome\'s population declined from over 1 million in the Imperial era to 100-200,000 after the siege of 537 AD. Observations made by the Spaniard Pedro Tafur, who visited Rome in 1436, reveal misunderstandings of the very nature of Roman aqueducts:\n""Through the middle of the city runs a river, which the Romans brought there with great labour and set in their midst, and this is the Tiber. They made a new bed for the river, so it is said, of lead, and channels at one and the other end of the city for its entrances and exits, both for watering horses and for other services convenient to the people, and anyone entering it at any other spot would be drowned.""\nIt is a real testament to Roman engineers that some of their aqueducts are still in use some 2000 years later. They have become iconic structures in their own right and modern aqueducts, for the most part, would not be unrecognizable to ancient Romans. That’s quite a feat.\nFeatured Image ""Aqueduct of Segovia"" courtesy of Bernard Gagnon/Creative Commons']"	['<urn:uuid:2518bad8-2a99-4b39-b3f3-e6f9351ad854>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	20	18	1025
55	How are pathology tests used throughout clinical trials, and what role do they play in ensuring informed consent from participants?	Pathology tests are used throughout clinical trials in multiple ways: they help determine eligibility by checking if participants meet inclusion criteria (like having specific cancer characteristics) or exclusion criteria (like liver and kidney function levels). During trials, they monitor drug responses, patient safety, and organ function, and help prove if interventions worked. They're also used in pharmacogenomic analysis to study genetic markers affecting drug responses, and in long-term safety monitoring. Regarding informed consent, pathology testing information must be clearly communicated to participants as part of the open and honest discussion about study procedures, risks, and benefits. Participants must understand all aspects of the testing involved before voluntarily agreeing to participate, and any new findings from pathology tests that might affect risks or willingness to continue must be disclosed throughout the study.	"['The term ‘clinical trial’ is laden with the hope of wonder treatments and medical breakthroughs but beyond the medical community, few people know what is truly involved in clinical trials and how pathology is a key component.\nThe purpose of a clinical trial is to establish evidence to inform clinical practice. Much emphasis is placed on trials that bring new drugs or devices to the clinic, but a large body of research also assesses which existing practices work best; these are known as comparative effectiveness trials.\nAll trials can be broken down into a series of steps:\n1. Hypothesis generation and design\nA clinical question is identified based on addressing an identified problem. For instance, there may be a suspected greater risk of infection in people with an increased BMI (Body Mass Index) who are undergoing large abdominal surgery. Researchers would first check their theory by cross checking medical records and pathology notes. As a possible solution, investigators might suggest using an antibiotic pre-emptively to prevent infection. To test this intervention, researchers would measure the number and types of any infections after surgery, as well as the overall health of patients. Pathology would be used in analysis of infections and ensuring patient safety in the trial.\nPathology is used to make sure a person meets the inclusion criteria to take part in a trial, for example that they have a cancer with specific characteristics such as HER2 positive breast cancer. There are also exclusion criteria that may prevent someone from participating, for example levels of immune system, liver and kidney function. These are confirmed by pathology testing.\n3. Ongoing analysis of drug response:\nIn clinical trials involving drugs, pathology testing is used to check that patients are receiving the dose of drugs as administered because drugs can metabolise differently in different people. Tests also ensure patient safety by monitoring critical blood and organ function that may be affected by drugs. Drug interactions must also be monitored, including interactions with substances inside the body such as foods and other medications, as well as external factors such as sun exposure.\n4. Analysis of data\nPathology results can be used to help prove an intervention has worked. In the example above of using pre-emptive antibiotics, pathology results could show significantly fewer infections in patients receiving the intervention. Other biomarkers could be measured and recorded as secondary outcomes, for example if patients receiving the intervention also had lower rates of inflammation post-surgery.\n5. Correlative studies and future work\nIn drug trials, pharmacogenomic analysis can be used – this testing looks at a person’s genetic make-up for markers that might affect how their body responds to the drug. This could enable researchers to discover or confirm genetic markers that influence the drug action. Discoveries could also point to new areas to research.\n6. Introduction to clinical practice\nFollowing a successful trial of a new drug, pathology results will be used in an application to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to have the drug approved for medical use in Australia. Not only can pathology prove effectiveness, test results may also inform clinical guidelines, for example when a drug could be toxic to patients with liver conditions or will only work for those who have a specific genetic mutation.\n7. Ongoing surveillance\nOnce a drug is approved it must be monitored for ongoing safety. Pathology tests can be used to look at the risk of long term side effects.\nPAA Ambassador, Prof Nik Zeps said:\n“Pathology really is integral to clinical trials. It is often involved throughout the process from deciding upon a theory and how to test it, to guiding future research and getting the right drug to the right patient. With the explosion in genomics and our growing knowledge of how genetics influence disease risk and response to treatment, pathology testing in clinical trials will become even more important to guide research.”', ""Informed Consent In Research\nObtaining informed consent for a research study requires open and honest communication between the researcher and the study participant.\nObtaining informed consent for a research study requires open and honest communication between the researcher and the study participant. Much attention has been given to the consent document readability and its comprehension. However, it is important to remember that the document is a proxy and reference for a conversation. The conversation should be based upon the key elements of the consent document which include but are not limited to; the study objectives, procedures, duration, risks, benefits, alternative options, confidentiality of records, contact information for any participant questions, compensation if applicable, additional costs and compensation for research injury if applicable. It is essential that participants understand that participating in a research study is completely voluntary; they can withdraw from the study at any time or choose not to participate.\nInformed consent should be obtained after the participant has been presented with pertinent information, has had adequate time to review the consent document and have all questions answered. Consent should also be obtained prior to any study specific procedures. Participant privacy during the discussion is paramount and the environment should be free of undue influence and coercion from the research team.\n- Video Link: General Informed Consent Requirements\nFor high risk protocols (e.g., Phase l/ll, gene transfer) it may be prudent and/or recommended by the local IRB to include the use of an independent party to be involved in the consent process. An individual obtaining consent may (un)intentionally influence a participant’s decision to consent to a research study. The use of a Research Subject Advocate can improve objectivity in communicating the presented information about the study.\nIt is important to note that informed consent is a continuous dialogue with the participant which reinforces the key elements of initial consent throughout the duration of the study. New adverse events or important findings that may increase a participant’s risks or willingness to continue in the research study should be disclosed to the participants and to the IRB.\n- HRPP Policy on Documentation of the Informed Consent Process\n- HRPP Policy on Informed Consent Process and the Elements of Informed Consent\n- FDA: A guide to Informed Consent\n- 45 CFR 46: General Requirements of Informed Consent\n- OHRP: Informed Consent FAQ\n- FDA: 21 CFR 50\n- FDA : IDE Informed Consent\n- CCTS: Consent Template Language\n- The OSU CCTS maintains a listing of template language for various risks and procedures that can be copied and inserted to draft consent documents. Please contact Rob Rengel for further information.\nSpecial Consent Considerations\nClinical research studies that involve children, non-English speaking individuals or the use of a Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) have additional guidances, regulations and processes that may apply.\n- Assent and Parental Permission\n- Emergency Research\n- Short Form Informed Consent\n- Research Involving Pregnant Women, Fetuses, or Neonates\n- Research Involving Prisoners\n- Research Involving Children\n- Vulnerable Populations: Students, Employees, and Adults Unable to Provide Consent\nDocumenting the Consent Process\nIt is important to document the consent process at the time the informed consent form is signed by the study participant or legally authorized representative. The source document should state the date, participant name, medical record number, study number and study title. It should state the key elements of the consent that were discussed with the potential participant and any further details of the discussion that are pertinent to the subject's understanding of the study or information that could impact their decision to participate in the study. It should state that the participant had adequate time to review all information and voluntarily signed the informed consent form(s) with an understanding that they are able to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. It should also state the participant received a copy of all forms signed and that the participant signed and dated the consent form prior to any research specific tests. It is essential that the forms are completed appropriately, without errors and omissions of signatures, printed names, initials and dates.""]"	['<urn:uuid:176becf1-55a9-4801-be6f-a9d6692eaeaf>', '<urn:uuid:359ab049-ce23-4d72-8cc9-211bfd35f86a>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	20	131	1332
56	What was historically significant about the Meuse River crossing at Dinant in 1944, and what makes this river important as a transportation route in Europe today?	The Meuse River crossing at Dinant in 1944 was a brutal battle where American forces faced fierce German resistance. The 9th Infantry Division attempted a night crossing, with the first waves suffering devastating losses - 20 men and Company A's commanding officer were all killed, captured or wounded. The 60th Infantry Regiment also established a bridgehead but lost 80% of its 2nd Battalion. Eventually, they succeeded with help from the 3rd Armored Division. Today, the Meuse serves as a major inland navigation route, connecting the Rotterdam-Amsterdam-Antwerp port areas to industrial zones upstream. It's navigable through the Netherlands and Belgium, reaching cities like Hertogenbosch, Venlo, Maastricht, Liège, and Namur. While larger vessels can navigate the northern portions, smaller commercial barges (about 40 meters long) can still reach as far as Givet, France.	"['– Northern France and Belgium –\nDuring the Battle of Normandy, the 9th Infantry Division captured 18490 prisoners between June 10th 1944 and July 1st, 1944. Added to the men were also weapons, food and vehicles. The Division itself had 300 men killed and 1851 men wounded. Reporter Ernie Pyle wrote a great tribute to the men of the 9th Infantry Division: “The Ninth was good. In the Cherbourg campaign it performed like a beautiful machine. Its previous battle experience paid off. Not only in individual fighting but in the perfect way the whole organization clicked. The Ninth did something in that campaign that we hadn’t always done in the past. It kept tenaciously on the enemy’s neck. When the Germans would withdraw a little, the Ninth was right on top of them!”\nSo, after the fighting that resulted in cutting off the Cotentin Peninsula and capturing Cherbourg and its port, the 9th Infantry Division was moved south into “Bocage Country”. Here, battlefields consisted of small fields separated by hedgerows, solid three foot thick and three foot high earthen mounds. These banks were capped with hedges, brushes, trees and sometimes wire. The rain did not help. Tanks were snarled up along the roads. Each man was on his own and a gain of 300 yards a day was a good day’s work. The American Forces, including the Old Reliables, were attempting to push south to the pivot point of St. Lo, the big city. The move was a build-up that would send the Third Army out into Brittany and the First Army toward Falaise and beyond.\nOn July 10th, 1944, VII Corps was on the offensive with the 4th, 9th and 83rd Infantry Divisions abreast. Crossing the Canal de Vire, the 9th Division moved on the Hommet Woods. Slowly but surely pushing on, it moved until it reached the St. Lo – Perriers Road by July 21st. A lot of action took place on the 25th of July, 1944. On this day all troops of the 47th Infantry Regiment were pulled back about 1200 yards north of the Periers – St. Lo road. They assembled in an area west of Ponte Ducrie, near the hamlets of La Cuillourie and Ponte Hairie. 1st Battalion held the area at the west, 2nd Battalion was in the middle, and the 1st Battalion on the east. Allied bombing started by medium bombers and the first raid went OK. However, by the time that the heavy bombers arrived, the south wind had blown the smoke designating the bomb line back onto the troops. As a result, the heavy bombers bombed their own men. Men of the 1st Battalion only suffered a few casualties. They were lucky, as one of the bombs dropped right in the middle of an aid station, but it proved to be a dud, and did not explode. 2nd Battalion also escaped with slight losses. The 3rd Battalion however suffered heavily. The Command Group of 30 men were all killed or wounded except for the Battalion commander and the Commander of K Company. Several other members of K Company and one platoon of M Company also suffered losses during the bombing. This all happened in the morning, around 0930 hours. Around 1100 hours, 2nd Battalion began to push forward and attacked an area near La Couperie. 1st Battalion fought near La Rillerie and went towards Marigny and the Periers – St Lo Road. 3rd Battalion took a bit longer to prepare, and fought their way via Montreuil. It sure was a though day for the 9th Infantry Division.\nMeanwhile, elements of the 4th Infantry Division on the 9th Division’s left entered St. Lo, opening the way out of Normandy. Hitler however, had other plans. He ordered 4 Panzer Divisions to strike westward toward Avranches on August 7th, 1944. To forestall the Germans, 1st Battalion of 39th Infantry Regiment was ordered to occupy the high grounds south-east of Cherence le Roussel and block all roads leading to Avranches. Then the enemy launched four reinforced companies against the Americans who countered them with bazookas, mortars and Artillery support. Roadblocks were established and the troops dug in for the night. At about 0300 hours that night, the enemy attacked again. This time the attack was supported by a Company of tanks. Brutal hand to hand fighting ensued. Hand grenades were hurled against tank tracks. Four times the Germans attacked with superior forces. Four times they were driven back with at least 10 of their tanks knocked out. The 39th Infantry Regiment, “The Falcons”, had made their own contribution to the ultimate destruction of Hitler’s Panzers.\nThen the Americans, British and Canadians had formed a pincer movement forcing the German 5th and 7th Armies into a salient between Falaise and Argentan. By August 14th, VII Corps had joined the Allied drive to close the gap. Attacking the “Falaise Gap” from the south, west of Argentan, the 9th Infantry Division, along with the 1st Infantry and 3rd Armored Division, squeezed the Germans. Steadily, the “Old Reliables” swept the north to the Briouze – Argentan Road. By nightfall on August 17th, 1944, they had reached the highway aided by the 746th Tank Battalion. Reconnaissance patrols contacted the British at 0948 hours the next morning. The gap was all but closed. Though most of the German armor managed to escape, 50,000 prisoners were taken. While the men of the 9th Infantry Division enjoyed a short rest in reserve, there was a change in Command. General Manton S. Eddy was promoted to commander of XII Corps, Third Army. Major General Louis A. Craig succeeded him as commander of the 9th Infantry Division.\nThe Ninth Division crossed the Seine River on August 27th, 1944. Resistance was scattered. The 47th Infantry Regiment cleaned out a rear guard in the woods north of Evry Les Chateau, taking 233 prisoners on the way to Marne. Infantry men rode the tanks and tank destroyers, crossing the Marne to reach Chateau-Thierry and Belleau Woods on the 29th of August. Dizy-le-Gros was reached on the 31st of August. The 9th Division had advanced 403 miles since August 1st, 1944!\nThe Liberation of Belgium began at 1107 hours on September 2nd, 1944, when members of the 9th Reconnaissance Troops crossed the border in the heavily wooded area near Momignies and proceeded to push toward Charleroi. This marked the beginning of an 11 days campaign that crossed Belgium and carried the 9th Infantry Division into Germany. Its first major goal was to cross the Meuse River at the city of Dinant, a famed pleasure resort overlooked by a fortress, 1000 feet above the river. 2000 German Infantry men, 6 batteries of Artillery, tanks, self-propelled and Anti-Tank guns awaited the Americans. General Craig decided to cross at night, feinting an attack at the center while flanking Dinant to the north and south.\nRubber boats and pontoon bridges were wrestled down steep banks to the river edge. Due to cross at midnight on September 5th, 1944, 1st Battalion 39th Infantry Regiment sent its initial wave at 3am. Twelve of the first fifteen assault craft were sunk. Twenty men and the commanding officer of Company A made it, but all were killed, captured or wounded. Fortunately the 3rd Battalion discovered a catwalk. GI’s began crossing early in the morning and by nightfall two Battalions were over, holding their bridgehead. North of Dinant, the 60th Infantry Regiment established a firm bridgehead, although it was achieved at the cost of 80 percent of losses for its 2nd Battalion. Enemy mortar and machine gun fire thwarted bridge-building attempts by the 15th Engineer Battalion.\nAn aid station was set up on the bridgehead by the 3rd Battalion, 60th Infantry Medical Detachment. An enemy counter attack forced the medics to remove equipment and casualties. Finding no boat, one medic swam 100 yards across the river, brought over a boat, enabling the medics to evacuate over 30 casualties through shrapnel and a hail of bullets.\nDuring the 6th of September, the Old Reliables enlarged their footholds. That same evening, 3rd Armored Division’s Task Force “King” rumbled in. Weary GI’s boarded the tanks and cracked through enemy lines into Dinant. With the bridgeheads expanding, the Engineers were able to place a tread-way bridge over the Meuse River. The enemy began its withdrawal during the night of 6th to 7th of September. Along with the 3rd Armored Division and the 4th Cavalry Group the 9th Infantry Division began leap-frogging, getting rides on Armored vehicles heading for Germany and the Siegfried Line. 200 Germans were killed at Bois-et-Borsu when they got in the way of the fast moving troops. The 47th Infantry Regiment joined the 3rd Armored Division to liberate Liege, the capital city of French speaking Belgium on September 9th, 1944. The U.S. First Army , including VII Corps and the 9th Infantry Division were now approaching Germany!\nSource: 9th Infantry Division – “Old Reliables” book', 'The Meuse at Dinant\n|Countries||France, Belgium, Netherlands|\n|Cities||Sedan, Charleville-Mézières, Namur, Liège, Maastricht, Venlo|\n|- location||Pouilly-en-Bassigny, Le Châtelet-sur-Meuse, France|\n|- elevation||409 m (1,342 ft)|\n|- elevation||0 m (0 ft)|\n|Length||925 km (575 mi)|\n|Basin||34,548 km2 (13,339 sq mi)|\n|- average||350 m3/s (12,360 cu ft/s)|\nThe Meuse (//; French: [møz]; Walloon Mouze [muːs]) or Maas (Dutch: Maas; IPA: [ˈmaːs]) is a major European river, rising in France and flowing through Belgium and the Netherlands before draining into the North Sea. It has a total length of 925 km (575 mi). The Meuse is the oldest river in the world.\nFrom 1301 the upper Meuse roughly marked the western border of the Holy Roman Empire with the Kingdom of France, after Count Henry III of Bar had to receive the western part of the County of Bar (Barrois mouvant) as a French fief from the hands of King Philip IV. The border remained stable until the annexation of the Three Bishoprics Metz, Toul and Verdun by King Henry II in 1552 and the occupation of the Duchy of Lorraine by the forces of King Louis XIII in 1633. Its lower Belgian (Walloon) portion, part of the sillon industriel, was the first fully industrialized area in continental Europe.2 The Meuse and its crossings were a key objective of the last major German WWII counter-offensive on the Western Front, the Battle of the Bulge (Battle of the Ardennes) in the winter of 1944/45.\nThe name Meuse is derived from the French name of the river, which evolved from the Latin name Mosa. The Dutch name Maas descends from Middle Dutch Mase, which comes from the presumed but unattested Old Dutch form *Masa, from Proto-Germanic *Masō. Only modern Dutch preserves this Germanic form, however.\nDespite its appearance, the Germanic name is not derived from the Latin name, judging from the change from earlier o into a, which is characteristic of the Germanic languages. Therefore, both the Latin and Germanic names were probably derived from a Celtic source, which would have been *Mosā.\nThe Meuse rises in Pouilly-en-Bassigny, commune of Le Châtelet-sur-Meuse on the Langres plateau in France from where it flows northwards past Sedan (the head of navigation) and Charleville-Mézières into Belgium.3\nAt Namur it is joined by the River Sambre. Beyond Namur the Meuse winds eastwards, skirting the Ardennes, and passes Liège before turning north. The river then forms part of the Belgian-Dutch border, except that at Maastricht the border lies further to the west. In the Netherlands it continues northwards through Venlo closely along the border to Germany, then turns towards the west, where it runs parallel to the Waal and forms part of the extensive Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta, together with the Scheldt river in its south and the Rhine in the north. The river has been divided near Heusden into the Afgedamde Maas on the right and the Bergse Maas on the left. The Bergse Maas continues under the name of Amer, which is part of De Biesbosch. The Afgedamde Maas joins the Waal, the main stem of the Rhine at Woudrichem, and then flows under the name of Boven Merwede to Hardinxveld-Giessendam, where it splits into Nieuwe Merwede and Beneden Merwede. Near Lage Zwaluwe, the Nieuwe Merwede joins the Amer, forming the Hollands Diep, which splits into Grevelingen and Haringvliet, before finally flowing into the North Sea.\nThe Meuse is crossed by railway bridges between the following stations (on the left and right banks respectively):\nThere are also numerous road bridges and around 32 ferry crossings.\nThe Meuse is navigable over a substantial part of its total length: In the Netherlands and Belgium, the river is part of the major inland navigation infrastructure, connecting the Rotterdam-Amsterdam-Antwerp port areas to the industrial areas upstream: Hertogenbosch, Venlo, Maastricht, Liège, Namur. Between Maastricht and Maasbracht, an unnavigable section of the Meuse is bypassed by the 36 km Juliana Canal. South of Namur, further upstream, the river can only carry more modest vessels, although a barge as long as 100 m. can still reach the French border town of Givet.\nFrom Givet, the river is canalized over a distance of 272 kilometres. The canalized Meuse used to be called the ""Canal de l\'Est — Branche Nord"" but was recently rebaptized into ""Canal de la Meuse"". The waterway can be used by the smallest barges that are still in use commercially (almost 40 metres long and just over 5 metres wide). Just upstream of the town of Commercy, the Canal de la Meuse connects with the Marne–Rhine Canal by means of a short diversion canal.4\nThe Cretaceous sea reptile Mosasaur is named after the river Meuse. The first fossils of it were discovered outside Maastricht 1780.\nAn international agreement was signed in 2002 in Ghent, Belgium about the management of the river amongst France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium. Also participating in the agreement were the Belgian regional governments of Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels (which is not in the basin of the Meuse but pumps running water into the Meuse).\nMost of the basin area (approximately 36,000 km2) is in Wallonia (12,000 km2), followed by France (9,000 km2), the Netherlands (8,000 km2), Germany (2,000 km2), Flanders (2,000 km2) and Luxembourg (a few km2).\nAn International Commission on the Meuse has the responsibility of the implementation of the treaty.\nThe costs of this Commission are met by all these countries, in proportion of their own territory into the basin of the Meuse: Netherlands and Wallonia 30%, France 15%, Germany 14.5%, Flanders 5%, Brussels 4.5%, Kingdom of Belgium and Luxemburg 0.5%.\nThe map of the basin area of Meuse was joined to the text of the treaty.5\nOn the cultural plan, the river Meuse, as a major communication route, is the origin of the Mosan art, principally (Wallonia and France).\nThe first landscape painted in the Middle-Age was the landscape of Meuse. For instance Joachim Patinir 6 He was likely the uncle of Henri Blès who is sometimes defined as a Mosan landscape painter active during the second third of the 16th century (i.e., second generation of landscape painters) 7\nThe main tributaries of the river Meuse are listed below in downstream-upstream order, with the town where the tributary meets the river:\n- Dieze (near \'s-Hertogenbosch)\n- Raam (river in North Brabant) (in Grave)\n- Niers (in Gennep)\n- Swalm (in Swalmen)\n- Rur/Roer (in Roermond)\n- Geleenbeek (near Maasbracht)\n- Geul (near Meerssen)\n- Geer/Jeker (in Maastricht)\n- Voer/Fouron (in Eijsden)\n- Berwinne/Berwijn (near Moelingen, part of Voeren)\n- Ourthe (in Liège)\n- Hoyoux (in Huy)\n- Mehaigne (in Wanze)\n- Sambre (in Namur)\n- Bocq (in Yvoir)\n- Molignée (in Anhée)\n- Lesse (in Anseremme, part of Dinant)\n- Viroin (in Vireux-Molhain)\n- Semois or Semoy (in Monthermé)\n- Sormonne (in Warcq)\n- Bar (near Dom-le-Mesnil)\n- Chiers (in Bazeilles)\n- Vair (in Maxey-sur-Meuse)\n- Mouzon (in Neufchâteau, Vosges)\n- Saônelle (in Coussey)\nThe mean annual discharge rate of the Meuse has been relatively stable over the last few thousand years. One recent study estimates that average flow has increased about 10% since 2000 BC.8 The hydrological distribution of the Meuse changed during the later Middle Ages, when a major flood forced it to shift its main course northwards towards the Merwede river. From then on, several stretches of the original Merwede were named ""Maas"" (i.e. Meuse) instead and served as the primary outflow of that river. Those branches are currently known as the Nieuwe Maas and Oude Maas.\nHowever, during another series of severe floods the Meuse found an additional path towards the sea, resulting in the creation of the Biesbosch wetlands and Hollands Diep estuaries. Thereafter, the Meuse split near Heusden into two main distributaries, one flowing north to join the Merwede, and one flowing directly to the sea. The branch of the Meuse leading directly to the sea eventually silted up, (and now forms the Oude Maasje stream), but in 1904 the canalised Bergse Maas was dug to take over the functions of the silted-up branch. At the same time, the branch leading to the Merwede was dammed at Heusden, (and has since been known as the Afgedamde Maas) so that little water from the Meuse entered the old Maas courses, or the Rhine distributaries. The resulting separation of the rivers Rhine and Meuse is considered to be the greatest achievement in Dutch hydraulic engineering before the completion of the Zuiderzee Works and Delta Works. In 1970 the Haringvlietdam has been finished. Since then the reunited Rhine and Meuse waters reach the North Sea either at this site or, during times of lower discharges of the Rhine, at Hoek van Holland.9\nOne recent study 10 notes that the difference between summer and winter flow volumes has increased significantly in the last 100–200 years. These workers point out that the frequency of serious floods (i.e. flows > 1000% of normal) has increased markedly. They predict that winter flooding of the Meuse may become a recurring problem in the coming decades.\n- Vosges: Neufchâteau\n- Meuse: Commercy, Saint-Mihiel, Verdun, Stenay\n- Ardennes: Sedan, Charleville-Mézières, Givet\n- Namur: Dinant, Namur\n- Liège: Huy, Liège, Visé\n- Limburg: Maastricht, Stein, Maasbracht, Roermond, Venlo, Gennep\n- Limburg: Maaseik\n- North Brabant: Boxmeer, Cuijk, Grave, Ravenstein, Lith, Heusden, Aalburg, Woudrichem\n- Gelderland: Maasdriel\n- South Holland: Dordrecht, Maassluis, Rotterdam\nThe Meuse (Maas) is mentioned in the (nowadays not sung) first stanza of the Deutschlandlied German national anthem.

57	How do different environmental factors affect treated wood surfaces, and what specific protections are needed for outdoor versus indoor wood applications?	Environmental factors like UV rays, rain, and humidity can severely damage wood surfaces. UV rays cause graying and surface cracking, while moisture leads to internal stress and micro-cracks. For outdoor applications, wood stains (lasurs) are most recommended as they penetrate deeply and allow moisture to escape through open pores. Indoor wood requires less protection, with three coats of protective coating typically being sufficient. For silicone-treated wood, the treatment provides additional benefits including improved resistance to fungi, molds, and water marking, making it particularly suitable for both indoor and outdoor applications.	"['US 4044172 A\nWood is colored both at its surface and interior by coating silicone treating liquid and heating to a temperature above about 170° C to effect color change.

The process of claim 13 wherein said silicone fluid is chosen from the group consisting of dimethyl siloxane polymer and phenylmethyl polysiloxane polymer.\nThe present invention relates, generally, to a process for treating wood. More specifically, the present invention relates to a process wherein the color and grain of the wood is enhanced without the use of pigments, stains, dyestuffs, and the like.\nMany conventional processes and materials are known for the coloring and staining of wood. Typically, the wood is colored by the application thereto of pigments or other dye stuffs which are carried either in solution or as a dispersion or suspension in a liquid vehicle. These conventional processes and materials suffer from a number of disadvantages. Most significantly, the great majority of the prior art wood coloring techniques effect a color change only at the surface of the wood whereby subsequent wear or scratching of the wood makes visible the untreated underlayers. This, in turn, renders such surface blemishes more visible requiring retreatment of the wood in order to maintain a fine finished appearance. In addition, most prior art stains do not provide protection against water and other materials which have a tendency to mark the wood. Accordingly, it is customary to apply to the wood, subsequent to the application of the coloring material, a preservative finish such as varnish, shellac, or a polymeric coating.\nOther disadvantages of prior art wood coloring processes and materials include the potential increase in combustability of the wood subsequent to coloring and the toxicity and unpleasant odor of some coloring materials which render the wood treated therewith unsuitable for certain applications.\nIt is a primary object of the present invention to provide a process for the coloring of woods, including hardwood, such that the treated wood has a color and finish quality suitable for use in the manufacture of furniture and the like.\nIt is an object of the present invention to provide a wood coloring technique which is easily controllable and which allows for the consistent and repeated production of a given color from one piece of wood to the next.\nIt is also an object of the present invention to provide a wood coloring process wherein the wood is colored not only at its surface but uniformly throughout.\nAnother object of the present invention is to provide a treated wood having a highly desirable surface finish, with a smooth feel that for many uses needs no further treatment or modification.\nIt is an object of the present invention to provide a finished wood which has improved wear properties and which is more easily polishable.\nIt is a further object of the present invention to provide a finished wood which will not water-mark and which has increased resistance to fungi and molds.\nStill another object of the present invention is to provide a treated wood which is more easily machineable than is untreated wood and whose strength approximates that of untreated wood.\nAccordingly, the present invention is directed toward a process for the coloring and treating of wood wherein the wood is coated or wetted on substantially all of its surfaces with a treating liquid and heated to a temperature and for a time sufficient to effect the color change. The treating liquid, at the heating temperature, is sufficiently stable so as to maintain the continuity of the coating and is also substantially inert to the color bearing constituents of the wood. It has been found that treating wood in accordance with this process results in a uniform coloring which, for a given wood specimen, is dependent only upon the time and temperature of the heating step.\nIn accordance with the present invention, wood is colored through the implementation of the following steps:\n1. Applying to substantially all surfaces of the wood a coating of treating liquid; and\n2. Heating of the coated wood to a temperature and for a time sufficient to effect the color change.\nAn important aspect of the present invention involves the physical and chemical properties of the treating liquid which is used to coat or wet the surfaces of the wood prior to heating. It has been found that in order to obtain the uniform and consistent coloring of the wood it is necessary that the treating liquid have a sufficient heat stability so as to maintain the integrity of the coating at the heating temperature. In addition, it is also necessary that the treating liquid by substantially inert to the color bearing constituents of the wood at the heating temperature.\nThe untreated wood used in the present invention should be clean and free from any surface contamination which might interfere with the complete and continuous coating of the treating liquid. No other pretreatment is required and both green or cured wood may be utilized. In fact, one desirable feature of the present invention is that green wood is simultaneously colored and cured in a simple and relatively short process. In addition, the present invention provides satisfactory coloring to any variety of wood, including hardwoods such as oak which heretofore have been difficult to stain.\nIn accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the treating liquid comprises a silicone fluid. A number of these polymeric liquids are available from the Dow-Corning Corporation, Midland, Michigan. Particularly, preferred treating liquids include dimethyl siloxane and phenylmethyl polysiloxane, both manufactured by Dow-Corning Corporation under the trade names, Dow-Corning 200 Silicone Fluid and Dow-Corning 710 Silicone Fluid, respectively.\nThe silicone fluids are suited to use in the present invention since they are available in varieties having both flash points which exceed the ignition temperature of wood and viscosity characteristics suitable for the appropriate coating or wetting of the wood surfaces. In addition, these water-clear liquid polymers are substantially inert, non-toxic, odorless and exhibit low surface tension which helps to assure the complete wetting of all surfaces of the wood.\nAs mentioned hereinabove, the wood subsequent to being coated with the treating liquid is heated to a temperature and for a time sufficient to effect the color change. It has been determined that the coloring temperature is above about 170° C but below that temperature which would cause ignition or combustion of the wood. Preferably, the wood should be heated to a temperature in the range of about 190° to about 230° C, since it is at these temperatures that rapid color change occurs without danger of thermal degradation to the wood.\nThe degree of coloring, that is, the degree to which the wood is darkened, or the shade of brown to black imparted in the practice of the present invention is related to the duration of the heating period and the thickness of the wood. For example, a white birch tongue depressor, approximately l/16 inch in thickness, which has been wetted with a silicone liquid, begins to darken and its grain becomes more readily visible after heating about 1 minute at a temperature of approximately 200° C. Continued application of heat up to a period of approximately 30 minutes, will result in a substantially darkened appearance, and further application of heat up to approximately 2 hours will result in a substantially black appearance similar to that of ebony.\nExtremely thin wood strips, such as veneers, will exhibit visible darkening in a matter of seconds when heated in accordance with the present invention. On the other hand, substantially thicker wood pieces will require longer periods of heating. For example, a white ash strip, having a cross-section 11/4 inch square, will show visible and uniform coloring throughout in about 30 minutes and exhibit a substantially darkened appearance in about 1 hour.\nSignificantly, wood subsequent to having been treated in accordance with the process of the present invention will not evidence thermal degradation, or scorching, at its surfaces, nor will it have suffered any appreciable reduction in strength (i.e., modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity) form that of the untreated wood. Thus, the coloring process does not appear to affect, in any significant way, the primary structural constituents of the wood.\nOne preferred method for carrying out the process of the present invention comprises immersing or dipping the wood into a bath of the treating liquid thereby coating substantially all the surfaces thereof and thereafter removing the wood from the treating liquid bath and passing it between parallel rows of infrared radiant heaters. Alternatively, the wood may be heated in an air oven after dipping. This procedure provides one particular advantage in that it may be readily utilized as a continuous process which requires only a relatively small bath of treating liquid.\nAnother preferred method for carrying out the process of the present invention comprises immersing the wood in a bath of the treating liquid which has been heated to a preselected temperature. In this case, the wetting and heating steps of the process occur almost simultaneously. One advantage to this last mentioned technique is that the treating liquid is impregnated into the wood to a greater degree, thereby enabling the tailoring or modification of other physical properties of the treated wood to meet the requirements of a given application. For example, in the use of silicone treating liquids, the simultaneous dipping and heating technique allows for the impregnation of greater amounts of the silicone. Wood so treated exhibits, in addition to the desired color change, many additional, highly desirable qualities, such as: improved wear, polishability, machineability, and increased resistance to fungi, molds and marking by materials such as water, alcohol and the like.\nWhile the mechanism through which this process provides uniform and consistent coloring is not entirely understood, it is believed that the present invention makes possible the selective volitization or vaporization of certain constituents in the wood and the controlled oxidation of other selected constituents within the wood thereby darkening and enhancing its appearance. More specifically, it is believed that the present invention allows for the volatilization of the secondary or extraneous constitutents of the wood such as the tannins, polyphenols, volatile oils and resins, gums and other complex organic compounds while, at the same time, leaving substantially intact the primary constituents of the wood, such as the cellulose, and hemicellulose, and perhaps the lignen of the wood also. It is theorized that the coating or wetting of the wood\'s surfaces permits only a controlled and limited flow of the volatilized secondary constituents through the tube-like cell trains of the wood. These secondary constituents, the extraneous or extractive materials, volatilize at a temperature lower than that at which the primary constituents of the wood begin to thermally degrade. Thus, it is believed that the controlled outflow of these volatilized secondary constituents prevents, or at least suppresses, the thermal degradation or oxidation of the primary constituents which typically occurs when the volatilized secondary constituents are free to flow unimpeded through the cell trains of the wood. It is further theorized that sufficient controlled oxidation of the wood occurs so as to produce the desirable color change in the color-imparting constituents thereof. This color change is perhaps comparable to the caramelizing of sugar, for example, or the desirable toasting, rather than burning or scorching, of bread. The controlled ""toasting"" of the wood is accomplished by the application of heat and may be analagous to the caramelizing of sugar wherein the application of heat effects an alteration of the chemical and physical properties of the sugar to produce a color change.\nIt is also believed that the coating of the wood enables the maintenance of more uniform temperatures throughout the wood thereby providing uniformity in color change.\nIt has been found that in order to provide the appropriate control of color change, it is necessary that the treating liquid be capable of maintaining the integrity or continuity of the coating at the heating temperature. This capability is related to the viscosity of the treating liquid, and it has been determined that a minimum viscosity of about 75 centistokes is required at the heating temperature to allow coloring to occur. Optimum control of the coloring process appears to occur where the treating liquid has the preferred viscosity of about 100 to 400 centistokes. Of course, the viscosity of the treating liquid may be higher so long as it is capable of maintaining a continuous coating on the wood surfaces at the heating temperature.\nIt has also been found that the treating liquid must be substantially inert to th color bearing or primary constituents of the wood. The term inert, in this context, is intended to mean only that the treating liquid does not act as a solvent and thereby interfere with the capability of the wood\'s primary constituents to develop color. Again the underlying theory is not completely understood, yet is has been found that if a treating liquid is utilized that dissolves the cellulose, hemicellulose and/or lignen, color development does not occur. Moreover, the dissolution of the primary constituents may also result in a rapid degradation in the strength of the wood.\nFrom the foregoing, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be utilized advantageously in a number of ways. For example, furniture pieces may be assembled and thereafter colored as a whole. This will assure uniform coloring of the entire piece in a short and simple process using a minimum of labor. Moreover, since the present invention provides coloring throughout, any surface blemish on the finished furniture piece may be easily removed by light sanding. Veneers may also be colored in accordance with the present invention, either prior to or after mounting on a suitable substrate.\nThe use of silicone fluids as treating liquids is particularly preferred in the coloring of woods used in the manufacture of furniture, panelling, hardwood and parquet floors, and the like where resistance to wear and watermarking and ease of polishing is desirable. They may also be used advantageously to color woods used to make dinnerware, such as salad bowls and the like, where toxicity and high resistance to solvents are required.\nOf course, it should be understood that various changes and modifications to the preferred embodiments of the present invention as described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention and without diminishing its attendant advantages. It is, therefore, intended that such changes and modifications be covered by the following claims:', '- 1 Wood Treatment and Protection – Decor Poducts\n- 2 Decorative products for surface protection\n- 3 Raw Materials Used in the Treatment and Protection of Wood\n- 4 Types of application in surface treatments\n- 5 Description and use of application types\n- 6 Causes of degradation of the protective layers of wood\n- 7 Outside a Wood Stain is the most recommended.\n- 8 Maintenance of wood protections\nWood Treatment and Protection – Decor Poducts\nFor the treatment and protection of wood, different products are used in different sequential steps. First we must take into account if the wood is going to be exposed to the interior or exterior and if the environment also contains some elements considered aggressive.\nWood protectors are divided into two types\n- Decorative products for surface protection: they protect the wood against atmospheric agents such as sun, rain, snow, UV rays and humidity changes.\n- Technical wood protectors: These elements are composed of chemical elements that protect the wood from bio-agents such as fungi, bacteria, and even termites or other insects.\nDecorative products for surface protection\nCoating material that, when applied to a material, ends up forming a transparent solid film (totally or partially) with insulating, protective and decorative properties. It is used both indoors and outdoors. It can be applied by brush, synthetic roller or spray machine\nCoating material with specific pigments normally in liquid form, which when applied on a surface, forms a film with specific insulating, protective and decorative properties. It can also be applied outdoors or indoors. Same form of application as in the case of varnishes.\nThese are products that leave the pore open to the wood. In addition, biocidal elements can be added, solar filters that allow the retardation of wood oxidation. If the Wood Stains are pigmented the oxidation effect is further delayed. They can be used indoors and especially outdoors. In the case of application, the brush is convenient because of its greater capacity to penetrate the product into the Wood. On the application of the Wood Stain or impregnating we will refer later\nRaw Materials Used in the Treatment and Protection of Wood\nThe most used in the manufacture of wood surface protection products are the following:\nResins (binder): its function is to waterproof wood against the action of water or other liquid elements.\nPigments: its function, in addition to its decorative mission, is to reduce the effect of the sun, UV and infrared rays.\nSolvents: its function is to transport and dissolve the resin and pigments without altering their chemical composition. Water (water-soluble) or Organic Solvents (organic or synthetic solvent products) are usually used.\nVarious components: its function is to improve its effectiveness in terms of protection. and added to solvents. The most common are hydrophobic, fungicides, insecticides, diluents, sunscreens, antioxidants or inhibitors\nTypes of application in surface treatments\nThe application of the protector on the wood is done by several product hands, by brush, brush (also the roller applies). The necessary time must be left to dry as specified by the manufacturer of each product. The wood must be dry free of internal exudation and the surface clean, especially of dust. The protection resulting from this application is very good indoors and very low outdoors, especially if it is exposed to the sun or other atmospheric agents such as rain.\nPowdered in the treatment and protection of wood:\nAn applicator or electric spray gun is used. This method saves time since its application is faster. in turn, the varnish paint layer is thinner than the previous method and takes less time to dry. Also consult the manufacturer of the products about this method of application. The protection of this application system is similar to the previous one. Also as the previous method the wood must be dry and clean. There is professional spraying in the tunnel, but it is not the subject of this topic, so we will not develop it here.\nThis application system consists of totally submerging the wood in ambient temperature conditions, for a period of time. Then the wood is removed and dried, especially in airy and dark environments. This method is not recommended in an environment with humidity higher than 70%.\nDescription and use of application types\nTreatment and Protection of Wood by Brushing\nThe protector that is applied (varnish, paint or Lasur) is organic or solvent based. The product is applied by brush, brush or roller. The mentioned product penetrates the pores of the wood by capillarity. This method consists of a superficial protection against the action of organic or environmental agents.\nConsiderations to take into account\nWood used indoors must be dry or contain a low percentage of humidity (up to 12%). If it is to be used outdoors it may contain some more moisture and especially if Lasur is applied. (up to 20%). Check where the wood is bought this aspect.\nThe color and the grain of the wood are intrinsic decorative values that must be taken into account when applying the coatings.\nthe wood contracts and expands with heat and humidity. It is important to buy wood with a low coefficient of expansion, since these micro movements crack the protective layer. And especially if wood is used outdoors. Wood used indoors suffer very few variations. Check when the purchase is made for this issue and ask if the wood has already been treated with resins to reduce shrinkage.\nWoods that are very porous absorb more product than less porous and therefore the application of wood sealants would be necessary.\nWood extracts are highly complex organic substances. They can be resins, oils, waxes or dyes (such as tannin). They can be viscous or liquid. If the wood has these characteristics, it is advisable not to apply any product, as they will prevent drying or crack protection. It would be un dried or not parked wood (green wood).\nPreparation of the wood surface :\nWith dry, clean wood and without exudates, when the product can be applied. You should never apply the product with exposure to the sun, since it varies dramatically not only the drying times but the mechanics of the formation of the protective film\nSpray Wood Protection\nThe protector is applied on the surface of the wood with a manual or electric spraying machine. When the system is used by spraying, it is more efficient than brushing, since the product is absorbed faster by penetrating the wood more.\nTherefore it is advisable if it is going to be used outdoors, since this application system confers some more protection. Apart from all of the above, the application is done much faster and drying is too. The rest of the characteristics are similar to those of the brushstroke in terms of surface and condition is environmental\nImmersion Wood Protection\nHere the woods are completely immersed in a water soluble or organic solvent product for a period of time. This period varies between 30 seconds and 15 minutes, depending on the type of protector and the size of the surface to be treated.\nThe protective product is introduced into the wood through the pores inwards. This type of application has the advantage over previous systems, which achieves greater contact between the surfaces of the wood to be protected and the protective product. You can also regulate the amount of product to be absorbed through greater or lesser exposure.\nThe disadvantage is obvious, and it is a waste of product if it is not used for a large number of pieces to be protected. Drying should be aired, dry and never exposed to sunlight or high relative humidity.\nAtmospheric Agents: Sun, rain, Humidity, temperature and UV rays\nNow, as the surface of the wood in question has been treated, we will see how the different agents of deterioration act against the protections applied to the wood. First we will cite all the degrading agents and then the recommendations for each type of protection and for each use.\nThe wood protection layer is affected not only by ultraviolet rays, but also by infrared. Abrupt changes in surface temperature, end by difference between external and internal stresses by producing cracks. UV rays attack the surface being fibrous and cracked. In this situation the humidity can penetrate more deeply accelerating the deterioration of the wood.\nThe wood attacked by UV rays has a gray surface. This situation is resolved with brushing and bleaching salts. If the sun exposure process combined with rain (which washes the cellulose) does not stop, deterioration is irreversible. The layers of protection in the wood usually change their physical composition and degrade, appearing scales or fissures.\nIt produces the heating of the exhibition area, favoring the evaporation of moisture from the wood and in a superficial way. in this way there are tensions or forces that act between the wet interior and the dry surface, producing internal micro cracks. This is called thermal stress of the material. These cracks then allow the entry of destructive agents. This radiation also affects the protective layers applied, cracking them. Heating of the wood can also lead to resin exudate, depending on the species and damage the protective layer.\nAtmospheric or environmental humidity\nWood is a material that absorbs moisture under normal conditions. A protective layer of varnish, paint or lasur, insulates it from this atmospheric agent. If the wood is in internal environments, humidity does not present a major problem. With three hands of protective coating is enough. But on the outside, if the wood has been exposed to sun and rain, the micro-cracks appear through which not only water but also ambient humidity will be absorbed. This is also valid where wood for humid environments with steam such as bathrooms and kitchens. The appearance of micro-fissures in the protective layer allows water to pass inside the wood, a fundamental factor to take into account in the treatment and protection of wood.\nFreeze and defrost effect\nThe moisture contained inside the wood in regions where there are freezing temperatures, freezes. When this happens the ice increases its volume producing cracks inside the wood. In defrosting the wood does not return to its previous state, producing a deformation. and also cracks externally in the protective layers.\nFire or high Temperatures\nDestroying element par excellence, exposure to fire, or high temperatures destroys the protective layer even in short periods. This can happen if the wood is near a heat source such as kitchens, grills or by accidental exposure.\nOutside a Wood Stain is the most recommended.\nUnlike varnish and synthetic paints, it penetrates deeply into the wood and does NOT form a layer. The finish is open pore, which facilitates the exit of natural moisture from the interior of the wood. They are ideal for outdoor wood that are exposed to environmental aggressions, as are all the elements listed above.\nIts resins are highly flexible and adapt to the physical variations that the wood of the wood suffers. The lasures have bright, matt or satin finishes.\nOutdoors, the use of synthetic varnishes or paints is not advisable because they do not withstand the aggression of environmental agents very well. Thus the aging of the film, cracks or directly the protective film is flaked.\nThe application of Wood Stain indoors\nFor the treatment and protection of the wood, if it is new it must be dry to ensure that it does not crack or deform. For the application of lasur the methods already described are used, but we recommend the brush and well-loaded, since the wood penetrates deeply. If inside the wood is not exposed to the sun you can use colorless lasur, with low UV protection.\nIt should be taken into account that the erosive action of the sand and salt particles carried by the wind in the coastal areas wear and erode the surfaces more quickly, so the maintenance periods should be shorter.\nThe application of Wood Stain :Outdoors\nThe same recommendation for brush application as the previous one taking the following precautions.\n- For a good treatment and protection of the wood, sand the wood previously in the direction of the grain with fine grade sandpaper.\n- Do not use other accessories to clean such as scourers, bleach, lavandines etc.\n- If fungicides are applied, let dry at least 24 hours before applying the lasur.\n- When wood funds are applied, do so after the fungicide application.\n- Do not apply Lasur directly in sunlight. This dramatically modifies the natural absorption and drying times.\n- If the wood is wet, let it dry for at least 24 to 48 hours, in a dry place and repaired from atmospheric elements\n- Do not apply outdoors if the temperature is near the freezing point\n- Apply in rain or in environments with 70% relative humidity is totally inadvisable\n- Use brushes that do not lose the bristles. We recommend flat brushes and not brushes.Lasures\nWood Stain are to water or solvent. A layer of one can be applied to the water on the other solvent, as long as the layer on which it is to be applied is completely dry. For the treatment and protection of wood with lasures, it should be borne in mind that water or solvent are application vehicles and that these evaporate completely and leave no residue. The woos stain are ideal for application on wooden pallets outdoors.\nMaintenance of wood protections\nThe durability over time of a lasur, varnish or paint are directly related to the exposure time to the degrading elements: Humidity, water, steam, UV rays, infrared, sudden temperature changes, Snow or freezing temperatures.\nElements that have a horizontal position, where it can be deposited without draining rainwater or other moisture, require more maintenance.\nIt is usually recommended once a year to sand clean the protective layer, apply a smooth sanding and at least one coat of product. In the case of varnishes and paints, when they accumulate several layers, it is already advisable to completely remove all the protective layers. Then the application on clean wood is suitable again as if it were new. In the case of lasur just apply one more product hand. To avoid darkening of the protective layer, a transparent lasur should be applied.']"	['<urn:uuid:c6ee6241-ce86-4aa6-8a5e-4b3aa8bfaf83>', '<urn:uuid:45307cde-ffba-475e-b408-37c3f2e1c2c6>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	21	90	5334
58	techniques for english language learners to improve listening comprehension strategies	There are five main strategies to improve listening comprehension: 1) Predicting content - using context to anticipate vocabulary and language style, 2) Listening for gist - identifying key content words to understand the overall picture, 3) Detecting signposts - recognizing linking words that help follow the speaker's direction, 4) Listening for details - focusing on specific information while ignoring irrelevant content, and 5) Inferring meaning - using clues and prior knowledge to understand the context. These strategies work best when used together, though prediction is mainly a pre-listening skill.	"[""How can learners improve their listening comprehension? Teacher Raphael Ahmed shares some useful strategies in one of our top five articles of all time, illustrated by artist Jamie Johnson.\nWhy listening is important\nIt should not be difficult to realise the importance of listening when we consider that it occupies about 45 per cent of the time adults spend in communication. This is significantly more than speaking, which accounts for 30 per cent, and reading and writing, which make up 16 per cent and nine per cent respectively.\nYet, for all its importance, students (and even teachers) often fail to give listening the attention it needs. This is all the more remarkable as learners often say that listening is the most challenging of all the skills in English.\nListening challenges for English language learners\nThere are many difficulties an individual may face in understanding a talk, lecture or conversation in a second language (and sometimes even in their first language). The speaker, the situation and the listener can all be the cause of these difficulties.\nContributing factors include the speaker talking quickly, background noise, a lack of visual clues (such as on the telephone), the listener’s limited vocabulary, a lack of knowledge of the topic, and an inability to distinguish individual sounds.\nWhile the challenges posed by the speaker or the situation may be out of the listener’s hands, there are a few skills or 'strategies' that English learners can use to help them along.\n1. Predicting content\nImagine you've just turned on your TV. You see a man in a suit standing in front of a large map with the symbols of a sun, clouds and thunder. What do you imagine he is about to tell you? Most likely, this is going to be a weather forecast. You can expect to hear words like 'sunny', 'windy' and 'overcast'. You'll probably hear the use of the future tense: 'It'll be a cold start to the day'; 'there'll be showers in the afternoon', etc.\nDepending on the context – a news report, a university lecture, an exchange in a supermarket – you can often predict the kind of words and style of language the speaker will use. Our knowledge of the world helps us anticipate the kind of information we are likely to hear. Moreover, when we predict the topic of a talk or a conversation, all the related vocabulary stored in our brains is 'activated' to help us better understand what we're listening to.\nPractise predicting content:\nWatch or listen to a recorded TV programme or clip from YouTube. Pause after every few sentences. Try to predict what is going to happen or what the speaker might say next.\nIf you are taking a listening test, skim through the questions first and try to predict what kind of information you need to listen out for. A question beginning 'How many..?', for example, will probably require you to listen for a specific number or quantity of something.\n2. Listening for gist\nImagine you are a superhero flying in the sky. From that height, it is possible to see what the entire area is like, how densely populated it is, the kind of houses in each area.\nWhen listening, it is also possible to get the ‘whole picture’ but with one crucial difference: information comes in a sequence. And in that sequence of information, there are content words (the nouns, adjectives and verbs) that can help you form that picture. We often call this listening for gist.\nFor example, the words 'food', 'friends', 'fun', 'park' and 'sunny day' have their own meanings, but when you hear the words in sequence, they help form the context of a picnic.\nPractise listening for gist:\nFind a short video with subtitles on a topic that interests you. Use the title to help you predict the content and then listen out for the content words. Go back, and listen again with the subtitles. How much did you understand the first time? Return to the video a week later and try again.\nWhen you learn new words, try to group them with other words used in a similar context. Mind maps are good for this.\n3. Detecting signposts\nJust like the traffic lights on roads, there are signposts in language that help us follow what we're listening to. These words, which link ideas, help us to understand what the speaker is talking about and where they are taking us. They're particularly important in presentations and lectures.\nFor example, if a university lecturer says: 'I am going to talk about three factors affecting global warming…' then later on you might hear the phrases 'first of all', 'moving on to' and 'in summary' to indicate the next part of the talk. Other words and phrases can function in a similar way. For instance, to clarify ('in other words', 'to put it another way'); to give examples ('to illustrate this', 'for example'), and so on. Take a look at this list of phrases for more examples.\nPractise detecting signpost language:\nMost course books for learners of English come with a CD and audio script. Find an example of a business presentation or lecture and see how many signpost phrases you can identify (listen more than once, if necessary). Then check your notes with the audio script.\nIn your notebook, group signpost phrases according to their functions, and continue to add new expressions as you come across them.\n4. Listening for details\nImagine you are a detective taking a closer look at those buildings you saw earlier on as a superhero. This time, rather than taking in the big picture, you're looking for something specific and rejecting anything that does not match what's on your list.\nSimilarly, when listening for details, you are interested in a specific kind of information – perhaps a number, name or object. You can ignore anything that does not sound relevant. In this way, you are able to narrow down your search and get the detail you need.\nIn a listening test, if you are asked to write down the age of a person, listen for the words related to age ('old', 'young', 'years', 'date of birth', etc.) or a number that could represent that person's age. If it is a conversation, you might wait to hear someone beginning a question with 'How old…?'\nPractise listening for details:\nDecide on a type of detailed information you want to practise listening for and watch programmes where you would expect to get that information. For example, you could listen to a weather report to get details about the weather, or you could follow the sports news to find out the latest results.\nIf you are taking a test, as soon as you get the question paper, skim through the questions, underline the important words and decide what kind of detail you need to identify in the listening text.\n5. Inferring meaning\nImagine you are a tourist in a country whose language you do not speak. In a restaurant, you hand over a credit card to pay for the bill, but the server seems to say something apologetic in response. Even though you don't understand his words, you can probably conclude that the restaurant doesn't take credit cards, and you need to pay with cash instead.\nThis is the technique of inferring meaning: using clues and prior knowledge about a situation to work out the meaning of what we hear.\nSimilarly, we can infer the relationship between people from the words they use, without having to find out directly. Take the following conversation:\nA: Tom, did you do your homework?\nB: I did, sir, but the dog ate it.\nA: That's a terrible excuse. You'll never pass your exams if you don't work harder.\nWe can infer from the use of the words 'homework' and 'exams' that this is a conversation between a student and his teacher. By using contextual clues and our knowledge of the world, we can work out what's being said, who is speaking and what's taking place.\nPractise inferring meaning:\nFind a YouTube clip from a popular television show, for example Friends. Now, rather than watch it, just listen to the dialogue. How much can you infer about what is taking place, who is talking and what their relationship is? Now listen to the clip a second time but watch it too. Were your conclusions correct?\nThe next time you hear a word you don't understand, try to guess its meaning using the context or situation to help you. But don't worry if you don't get it the first time. As with everything in life, the more you practise, the better you will get.\nThese strategies are not stand-alone. While prediction is mostly a pre-listening skill, others need to be used simultaneously to get the best result when listening.\nThis article is one of our top five most-read of all time.\nRaphael Ahmed is still a teacher of English, and currently interested in AI and its implications on assessment. He got into teaching English in 2011, to make himself more internationally mobile; he heard that he could ‘go places’ if he did the Cambridge CELTA. Apart from learning, teaching and travelling, he’s interested in woodworking, painting, cooking, writing and coding.\nJamie Johnson is an artist and illustrator based in Glasgow, Scotland. He works in painting, collage, drawing and various digital media techniques. Jamie has exhibited his work in galleries around the UK, Europe and North America, most recently as a solo show at Chopping Block Gallery in London. He continues to work with a wide variety of clients as an illustrator and designer, alongside a personal interest in community-based projects.""]"	['<urn:uuid:15befa98-e455-4b31-9806-21ae9531d732>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	10	89	1615
59	what is integrity beef value added program	The Integrity Beef Alliance is a successful value-added calf program that has operated for 18 years. It requires strict protocols including robust health and preconditioning programs, specific genetic standards for bulls, and thorough documentation. Members must vaccinate their calves with approved products, precondition them for 60 days after weaning, and use bulls from eight approved breeds that rank in the top 20% for weaning and yearling weights. The program has proven successful with calves performing well in feedyards and earning premiums at sale time.	['Walking the talk.\nIn its 18 years of existence, that perhaps more than anything is what elevated the Integrity Beef Alliance to one of the most successful value-added calf programs in the country. It’s that ability to walk the talk about value-added calves — developing a strong program and keeping it honest — that has kept the Integrity Beef Alliance sustainable.\nAnd that’s one of the many aspects of the program that earned it the 2018 BEEF Trailblazer Award, sponsored by John Deere. Now in its 25th year, the BEEF Trailblazer Award honors efforts beyond the ranch gate to make the beef business better.\nBeef business chatter about the value of value-added calves is not new. In fact, it’s been going on for decades now. Indeed, there have been any number of well-conceived, value-added cattle marketing programs over the years. Some are still viable. But many have fallen by the wayside. Perhaps some were ahead of their time. Perhaps some weren’t controlled tightly enough. Perhaps some just didn’t have enough people power behind them to keep them viable.\nThe Integrity Beef Alliance, which is a terminal program, checks all those boxes. The most important one, however, is reflected in its name.\n“The name is very fitting because the members police themselves, probably harder than I do,” says Robert Wells, Ph.D., Integrity Beef executive director and a livestock consultant with the Noble Research Institute in Ardmore, Okla.\nFirst, some history\n“Integrity Beef started around the year 2000,” Wells says. “It was one of those things where our CEO at the time challenged our consulting teams to come up with what he called a BHAG — big, hairy, audacious goal.”\nAs the teams pondered that challenge, an idea that floated to the top was the need for producers to be paid for the value-added management practices that the livestock consultants preach. And the foundation of Integrity Beef was birthed.\nAn overnight success, however, it was not. “Early on, our growth was slow, and that was deliberate. As we were developing the program, getting the kinks out, we wanted to make sure we didn’t let the program outgrow our ability to service it,” Wells says.\nThe first program was dubbed Noble’s Livestock Production System. “It’s evolved from the LPS to a beef production system,” Wells says. “Then about 10 years ago, we trademarked the name Integrity Beef. The program had been around long enough that we felt we had the kinks ironed out.”\nEven though it’s now a stand-alone organization, the ties with Noble Research Institute remain firm. And that checks another box. Wells is employed full time by the Noble Research Institute, but a big part of his job is to run the Integrity Beef Alliance and ensure its members adhere to the protocols that have been established.\nPutting the value in value-added\n“You’ve got to be willing to accept that what you’re doing might be wrong.” That may be the most important and fundamental thought process that has allowed the 50-some cow-calf producers who are members of the Integrity Beef Alliance to realize a premium for their calves, says Mike Berkley, 2018-19 president of the group.\nThat’s because the protocols required to tack the moniker “Integrity Beef” on a set of calves are strong, wide and deep. That means, for many producers, a fundamental change in management philosophy.\nBerkley, who ranches near Forestburg, Texas, says one hurdle in the cattle business is people doing it the way it used to be done. “We cannot, as an industry, get progressive or meet the needs of consumers unless we’re willing to change.”\nTo that end, Wells says one of the things the program continuously strives for is to make sure it stays on the cutting edge, leading the industry. “Some of the things we ask members to do are not standard for the industry. But what Integrity Beef is about is being a leader in the industry, setting an example for other producers who watch what Noble is advising and watch what Integrity Beef is doing.”\nBecause the Integrity Beef Alliance is a terminal program, with both steers and heifers headed for a feedyard, the protocols lean heavily on a robust health and preconditioning program. All calves get two rounds of a modified live viral vaccine and two rounds of blackleg. Beyond that, calves must have a minimum of one round of a shipping fever vaccine and be dewormed with name-brand product.\n“And we specify products,” Wells says of the vaccination program. “There’s a list they get, and there are at least three products in each category they can pick from.” The products aren’t confined to one company, but they must have scientific validity behind them. That means the products must have research data that have been published in a peer-reviewed technical journal.\nAfter weaning, calves must be preconditioned for a minimum of 60 days.\n“The cows must be PI-BVD-[persistent infection-bovine viral diarrhea] negative, and we determine that by testing the calf.” For surveillance, the entire cow herd must be tested every five years.\nDon West, Verden, Okla., unloads his calves prior to the Integrity Beef Alliance sale last November at the OKC West livestock auction. West, who runs his own cow herd as well as managing the family’s ranch, says the difference between calves raised under the Integrity Beef Alliance standards and commodity calves is striking.\n“Then we require the cows be vaccinated annually, a minimum with a killed virus for respiratory disease and a blackleg,” Wells says. “Our preference is to have a modified live vaccine, and most herds are working toward that. But it’s not the easiest thing to convert a mature cow herd to a modified live vaccination program.”\nThe reason for the cow vaccination is to confer as much immunity as possible to the calf through fetal programming and enriched colostrum, he adds.\nBeyond that, members of the Integrity Beef Alliance must be Beef Quality Assurance-certified. “When the cattle are being worked, we expect that there is at least one person chute-side who is BQA-certified, making sure that all BQA practices are upheld,” Wells says. In fact, he prefers that everyone working Integrity Beef calves is BQA-certified. He even has a list of day workers in Texas and Oklahoma who are certified and will recommend them if extra help is needed.\nThen there’s genetics\nThe thing that separates Integrity Beef calves from the rest, however, is the program’s genetic requirements. “No other preconditioning program or value-added calf program out there has a genetic standard requirement,” Wells says.\nFor beginners, all bulls must be registered and of one of eight approved breeds. Initially, the program recognized Angus and Charolais as approved breeds. Since then, it has opened to Red Angus, Hereford, Beefmaster, Gelbvieh, Brangus and Simmental.\nBut that’s just the beginning. Calves must be sired by bulls in the top 20% of their breed for weaning weight and yearling weight when the bull is purchased, as measured by EPDs.\nBut single trait selection is a bad idea. So Integrity Beef members are also looking for bulls in the top half of their breed for other important traits, such as calving ease, marbling and others.\nWhile that’s not a requirement, it’s important. “In today’s day and age, a value-added calf is multifaceted,” Wells says. “He’s got to be able to mash the scales down for the cow-calf producer. But he’s also got to be able to ring the bell for the guy who owns him next. Because if [the calf] doesn’t, he’s not coming back. It’s got to do well for all segments of the industry, and everyone has to be able to make money on it,” Wells says.\nBased on the performance of the last set of calves to be harvested, they’re doing just that. The cattle graded over 90% Yield Grade 1, 2 and 3, and about 80% Choice or better. They had a feed conversion of about 5.9:1, 3.4 pounds average daily gain and industry standard health losses.\nThen there’s the paperwork\nIndeed, no job is finished until the paperwork is done. All bull registration papers must be sent to the Integrity Beef office, where they’re kept on file.\n“We require all of our producers to turn in health forms, complete with serial numbers, lot numbers and expiration dates from the bottles. If they cannot provide the serial and lot numbers, then receipts — showing they purchased the required amount of drugs and what drugs and pharmaceuticals they said they did and the quantity — must match up to the number of head to be treated.” Wells says.\n“We require a paper trail; every producer knows if they don’t have that paper trail, they aren’t allowed to sell in the program. Because that’s upholding the standards and integrity of the program.\nRunning the numbers\nBeyond that, participation in the program is minimal — $2 per head. Well, sort of.\nIt cost Don West $4,000 the first year he was part of Integrity Beef, the cost of a program-compliant Charolais bull. But the Verden, Okla., rancher is quick to point out that what he paid for the bull was an investment, not a cost. And his return on investment was indeed worth the money.\nWhat’s the value of a value-added calf? That’s determined at sale time. But cattle that can go on feed with no health problems and turn the crank on performance and carcass merit are worth more to feedyards, because they cost less throughout the feeding period.\nWest runs his own cow herd as well as managing the family ranch. “I gave $4,000 for him, and he more than paid for himself in the first year,” with just the weight difference between his calves and the family calves.\n“Last year, my calves weighed more than 200 pounds heavier than the family’s calves, and everything else was pretty much the same,” West says. Looking at price, he says his calves rang up better than $200 per head more than the family calves.\nFor Wells, it’s simple mathematics. Say you’re spending $2,500 on bulls and you drop $5,000 on an Integrity Beef-compliant bull, which Wells says would be on the high end of what Integrity Beef producers spend on genetics.\n“If you keep him in the herd for five years and breed him to 25 cows a year, those calves only have to make the producer another $20 annually to reach that $5,000 breakeven. If you look at $1.50 on the value of that weight, his calves only have to sell 13 pounds heavier than what they did before.”\nLooking at 2008 data from the National Animal Health Monitoring System, Wells says Integrity Beef calves will wean about 63 pounds heavier than the national average. “If you take that extra 63 pounds, take off the breakeven of 13 pounds, that 50 pounds extra is all profit. Then put the calves in an aggressive preconditioning program, and their high genetic capacity will increase the sale weight differential that much more.”\nSpreading the wealth\nWhen it comes to marketing Integrity Beef calves, however, members have all options open to them. The OKC West livestock auction near El Reno holds a sale for Integrity Beef calves every fall that’s become popular with order buyers looking to fill feedyard pens with calves that will hit the ground running.\nThe December 2018 sale saw around 900 calves come through the ring. They netted almost $4 per cwt for heifers and $2 per cwt for steers more than the commodity calves that sold that day.\nBut, Wells says, this is not the complete story. When compared to other calves at the market, they are heavier on weight per day of age than the commodity cattle. Integrity Beef calves are spring-born and sell at 8 to 10 months of age at an average of 775 pounds. Additionally, it is rare that producers experience health issues with the calves on the ranch during the preconditioning phase.\nBut Integrity Beef producers aren’t required to sell through the sale. “The program is about opening up new avenues of marketing,” Wells says. “So we’ve got calves that will market directly to feedlots, some will sell through Superior Livestock Auction and other [members] who utilize other marketing venues.”\nIn fact, the Integrity Beef Alliance is recognized as a genetic merit program with Superior Livestock. Producers get logo recognition on the video and catalog.\nAnd Wells stresses that the program is open to any size operation. You don’t have to have a truckload of calves to be a member. You just need the desire to manage your operation in a way that will net you a premium when you sell your calves.\nFor many years, the Noble Research Institute concentrated its efforts in a 47-county region of Oklahoma and Texas. And those two states are where most of the Integrity Beef members ranch. But the program is open to anybody in the nation.\n“We currently have people working toward getting in the program in Kentucky, Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Central and South Texas,” Wells says.\nAs time goes by, expect that list to grow. But don’t expect any letup in the integrity behind the Integrity Beef name.\n“How has Integrity Beef stood the test of time for 18 years? A lot of it is due to the membership having the resolve to have a great program,” Wells says. Another factor is an engaged and active board of directors who uphold the intent of the program, coupled with support of the Noble Research Institute.\n“It’s easy to talk to the folks at the feed store or coffee shop. But it’s the dedication of producers in the program to stay the course; they recognize that what we’re doing is the right thing.”\nIntegrity Beef Alliance replacement heifer program\nIf necessity is the mother of invention, the Integrity Beef replacement heifer program has a deep pedigree. “The replacement heifer program was born as an offshoot to the terminal program as an answer to a question we were continually getting from our terminal producers,” says Robert Wells, executive director of the Integrity Beef Alliance and a livestock consultant with the Noble Research Institute.\nThe question? Where to find good-quality females to complement the genetics required by the Integrity Beef program.\nSo, beginning in 2016, the replacement heifer program was born. “The calves out of those heifers have to be program-compliant for the Integrity Beef terminal program. So, they had to be out of sires that are in the top 20% for weaning weight and yearling weight. That’s easy to do. The hard part is finding curve-bender bulls that also express calving ease,” Wells says.\nSo in addition to the growth requirements, bulls that qualify for the heifer replacement program must also be in the top 20% of their breed for calving-ease direct.\nBeyond that, all heifers must have a DNA test. “That way, we can peel back the hide to know what’s really there in relation to calving ease, average daily gain, tenderness and marbling, stayability and residual average daily gain. This allows our members to discern which ones they want and really develop a herd that fits their needs.”\nThe heifers must be raised with the same health protocols as required for the terminal program, with the addition of breeding vaccinations.\nThe program is still a work in progress, but it is working. “We’re seeing extremely low dystocia rates in the first-calf heifers. But we’re having our cake and eating it, too, because the calves off of these first-calf heifers are weaning pretty close to 600 pounds,” Wells says.\nIn addition, a second-calf female is also eligible, with proper documentation. “There are producers out there who either shouldn’t or don’t want to calve out heifers, so we wanted to have a product to fit those producers.”']	['<urn:uuid:6fc18670-1745-4f5c-ab8e-c00a87ed2e94>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	7	84	2633
60	vocal cord dysfunction diagnosis process clinical manifestations formal evaluation methods	Vocal cord dysfunction diagnosis requires three key elements from clinical manifestations: intermittent stridor, laryngoscopic evidence of paradoxical vocal cord adduction during inspiration (showing characteristic posterior 'chink'), and pulmonary function tests showing lack of bronchospasm with flattened inspiratory flow volume loop. The formal evaluation process includes four main procedures: detailed case history collection, perceptual assessment of voice quality, instrumental measurements, and laryngoscopic examination using various techniques such as rigid endoscopy or flexible nasendoscopy.	"[""Author: John Andereck, MD (EM Resident Physician, PGY-2, NUEM) // Edited by: Grant Scott, MD // Expert Commentary: James Walter, MD\nCitation: [Peer-Reviewed, Web Publication] Andereck J, Scott G(2016, September 6). Vocal Cord Dysfunction [NUEM Blog. Expert Commentary By Walter J]. Retrieved from http://www.nuemblog.com/blog/vocal-cord-dysfunction/\nA middle aged woman presents for “asthma exacerbation” and is triaged as ESI 2 with vital signs of T 97.6, HR 111, RR 24, BP 118/61, and Sat 98% on room air. In the room she is tripoding on the bed in terrible respiratory distress and can only answer questions with nodding or shaking her head. Time to mobilize.\nWhile starting a continuous nebulizer treatment, administering 125 mg IV methylprednisolone and 2 g IV magnesium, and setting up for a potential airway, we use yes or no questions to get a history. She has asthma, has been on steroids for the past five days, and has been using her nebulizer at home constantly with no improvement. She has had a persistent dry cough (which I note frequently on exam) that triggered this exacerbation, but no fevers or chills. No history of allergy or anaphylaxis. She has been to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) before and was intubated one time about 18 months prior.\nOn exam, I count her respirations at 60/minute with a heart rate in the 120s on the monitor. Her oxygen saturation remains 98-100% on non-rebreather and she is normotensive. She has no neck swelling. On lung exam, she is using accessory muscles and has virtually no air movement with very soft inspiratory “squeaking” and expiratory wheezes.\nAfter about 20 minutes with continuous nebulized albuterol-ipratropium her tachypnea hardly improves and she is only moving slightly more air. Despite her tachypnea and apparent respiratory distress, she is able to text on her phone and lay forward on the bed, which she says is more comfortable. The picture just does not quite fit. Nevertheless, due to her persistent work of breathing, we decide to give 0.3 mg IM epinephrine, place her on non invasive ventilation (NIPPV), and consult the MICU.\nOn NIPPV, her respiratory rate improves and she is noted to have much more significant inspiratory stridor in addition to expiratory wheezing. As significant as her work of breathing is, and as little improvement as she had with our multiple interventions, she is not decompensating and has maintained more than adequate saturations throughout her entire emergency department stay. When the MICU resident called back, he asked: “does she even have asthma?” She had been evaluated in pulmonary clinic recently where her existing diagnosis of cough-variant asthma had been questioned and the possibility of vocal cord dysfunction was raised.\nOnce in the MICU, she was started on heliox and remained on NIPPV for the next 24 hours but never required intubation. ENT was consulted and laryngoscopy demonstrated paradoxical vocal cord motion on inspiration consistent with vocal cord dysfunction. She was discharged from the MICU the next day.\nVocal Cord Dysfunction\nVocal cord dysfunction (VCD) is a condition characterized by paradoxical vocal fold motion with inspiration leading to stridor, air hunger, tachypnea, chest tightness, and a feeling of suffocation [1-3]. A number of different triggers for VCD have been identified since the condition was first described in 1974. Initially, this was thought to be a purely psychiatric condition that was a form of conversion disorder, initially termed “Munchausen’s Stridor” by Patterson et al . While many patients with VCD do carry psychiatric diagnoses, exercise, irritants (reflux of gastric contents, upper respiratory infections, post-nasal drip), and asthma have been identified as other triggers . The interplay of asthma and VCD has been difficult to establish. Estimates of concomitant asthma diagnoses range from one third to one half of all patients with VCD, however it is common for patients with VCD to be completely misdiagnosed – often for years – as having refractory asthma [2,5,6].\nDiagnosis of VCD is three-fold: (1) clinical symptoms of intermittent stridor; (2) laryngoscopic evidence of paradoxical vocal cord adduction during inspiration, often demonstrating the characteristic posterior “chink” (Figure 1); and (3) pulmonary function tests (PFTs) demonstrating lack of significant bronchospasm and presence of a flattened inspiratory flow volume loop (Figure 2) [2,6]. Clearly we will not be diagnosing VCD in the emergency department (ED) with these diagnostic criteria, so our suspicion must be clinical and must include a broad differential of other causes of upper airway obstruction and respiratory distress (Figure 3).\nRecommended ED Approach\nIn general, VCD should be a diagnosis of exclusion in the ED – the risk of missing something more life threatening is high and none of us should be too cavalier about making this diagnosis in someone who does not already have confirmed VCD by laryngoscopy and PFTs. However, there are features that may suggest it.\nIn cases in which the suspicion for VCD is high and the management of asthma (as in our case) or other upper airway issue has been unsuccessful, then consider VCD specific interventions in an effort to avoid an unnecessary intubation.\nI like to break up the emergent management of VCD into three primary components: treating the life threats, specific interventions for VCD, and anxiolysis.\n- Treating the life threats: Once again, the worst thing to do in VCD is to miss the more serious diagnosis. An exacerbation of VCD can present for all the world like status asthmaticus, anaphylaxis, or foreign body aspiration. Treat initially with nebulizers, oxygen, steroids, magnesium, epinephrine, and x-ray before proceeding. If the clinical course is not improving as expected, then move on to #2.\n- VCD-specific support: There are a number of breathing techniques that have been described to help open up the airway. These include pursed lips breathing, blowing through a short straw to move the obstruction to the lips rather than the glottis, making an “s” sound on expiration, or rapid panting in an effort to activate the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles [1, 5]. There are reports of inhaled heliox (70-80% helium, 20-30% oxygen) being used in VCD exacerbations as the lighter helium helps decrease turbulent flow across the narrowed cords [5,6].\n- Anxiolysis: These patients are often extraordinarily anxious and are in need of reassurance that their oxygen saturation is fine despite their feeling of air hunger . In many cases, trialling low doses of benzodiazepines will help slow the respirations and calm the patient. Sub-dissociative doses of ketamine have also been reported multiple times to help break the VCD flare, though if you are going to push ketamine be ready to paralyze and intubate as this may cause worsening laryngospasm .\nVCD is rare, but not as rare as you might think. If you have a patient that is tachypneic with wheezing or inspiratory stridor but not actually crashing, consider whether you can save them a tube by thinking about this deceptive diagnosis.\nVCD is a scary condition that often mimics status asthmaticus, foreign body aspiration, or anaphylaxis.\nTreat VCD initially as a life threat, especially if the patient does not already carry a confirmed diagnosis (with direct laryngoscopy and PFTs).\nIf something in the presentation does not add up (tachypnea without hypoxia, respiratory distress that is not positional, etc.) and if the patient’s course is not improving significantly with maximal therapy, ask whether this could be VCD.\n- If VCD is suspected, try heliox, pursed lips breathing, panting, and anxiolysis (benzodiazepines vs. ketamine).\n- Thinking of VCD with stridulous patients in distress can lead to early appropriate therapy and can potentially save patients an intubation and a trip to the ICU.\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on this thoughtful review of vocal cord dysfunction (VCD). This is an important yet easily overlooked clinical entity for emergency physicians, internists, and pulmonologists. I’ve organized my feedback into several key themes.\nKey Take-Home Point\n- Pulmonologists most commonly see these patients in clinic for work-up of severe persistent asthma or chronic cough. In the outpatient setting, there is time for a detailed history and step-wise diagnostic testing. As emergency physicians, you will encounter these patients when they are acutely symptomatic, often with striking clinical features as presented in the case. While VCD is an important diagnostic consideration in a patient with a history of difficult-to-control asthma, you correctly emphasize that emergency physicians should always treat an acutely ill patient with suspected asthma with therapies to reduce bronchoconstriction even when there is suspicion for VCD. You mention, “none of us should be too cavalier about making this diagnosis in someone who does not already have VCD confirmed by laryngoscopy or PFTs.” I would argue that even in a patient with previously confirmed VCD, the default for emergency physicians should still be to treat these patients aggressively for asthma. As you note, there is substantial overlap between VCD and asthma (over 50% of patients with VCD may have concurrent asthma ). As a result, a prior diagnosis of VCD should not reassure clinicians that an acute flare of symptoms is explained entirely by VCD.\n- The case described has many concerning features in both the history (persistent symptoms despite steroids/frequent short-acting bronchodilator use and a history of prior intubations) and exam (marked tachypnea, severe distress, and poor air movement). These red flags along with the prolonged nature of the symptoms and expiratory wheezing (both of which are atypical for VCD) should prompt immediate and aggressive therapy for presumed status asthmaticus before alternative explanations are considered (as was done).\nOur Evolving Understanding Of VCD Epidemiology And Pathophysiology\n- You correctly describe the evolution in our understanding of VCD epidemiology. The typical board question for VCD focuses on a middle-aged female healthcare worker with generalized anxiety disorder or a history of abuse. This is based on early studies including the work by Patterson that you cite. We now recognize that while VCD does seem to be more common in females, it is also commonly diagnosed in men and is identified in patients of all ages .\n- There is growing evidence that a wide range of co-morbid conditions beyond psychiatric disease may precipitate or contribute to VCD. One of the major pathogenic mechanisms is laryngeal hyper-responsiveness which may be triggered by post-nasal drip or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [9,10]. A variety of neurologic disorders and direct trauma to the larynx (from either surgery or endotracheal intubation) have also been linked to VCD . In clinic, we take a detailed history for symptoms of post-nasal drip and GERD for any patient with suspected or confirmed VCD and treat aggressively if either condition is suspected. It is also worth noting that post-nasal drip and GERD are frequent contributors to suboptimal asthma control.\nYour table “when to suspect VCD” nicely summarizes common clinical features in patients with VCD. It is worth emphasizing that many of these features are also found in patients with severe persistent asthma (frequent ED visits, no response to asthma therapy, more than five intubations) and should not be viewed as definitive evidence that the patient does not have asthma.\n- A recent review in the European Respiratory Journal has a helpful table comparing asthma with VCD :\n- For me, the localization to the throat and perceived dyspnea during inspiration are the most helpful features that distinguish VCD from asthma (although certainly not 100% sensitive or specific for VCD).\nVariable Extrathoracic Obstruction\nAs this is the hallmark finding of VCD on spirometry, it is important to understand the underlying physiology (images are from a nice physiology discussion published in the Annals of the American Thoracic Society ).\n- The key pressures involved are alveolar pressure (the sum of lung elastic recoil pressure and pleural pressure) and airway transmural pressure (pressure inside the airway minus pressure outside the airway)\n- To illustrate how these pressures change with tidal breathing, note the figures below.\n- With a variable extra-thoracic obstruction (due to laryngeal pathology like VCD), inspiration causes a drop in airway transmural pressure, narrows the caliber of the large airway, and reduces flow. This causes flattening of the inspiratory limb of the flow volume loop that is characteristic of VCD (blue arrow)\n- The obstruction is “variable” because forced expiration causes a rise in airway transmural pressure, dilating the airway and relieving the obstruction so the expiratory limb of the flow volume loop appears normal (red arrow). In asthma, the expiratory limb can appear scooped like is classically seen in COPD. Importantly, spirometry is usually normal when a patient is asymptomatic.\n- As you mention, the gold standard is direct visualization of vocal cords while a patient is symptomatic (which can be induced with methacholine or exercise).\n- If there is a concern regarding potential VCD in the ED, an ENT consult for a fiberoptic upper airway examination can be very helpful to document paradoxical adduction of the vocal cords.\n- Other potential diagnostic tests such as dynamic upper airway CT are not as relevant to EM .\n- There is little prospective data to guide treatment. As you mention, initial treatment in the ED treatment should be directed at potential asthma.\n- Positive airway pressure (via CPAP or BiPAP) can be helpful  and there is some data regarding the beneficial effects of heliox  although I have not seen it used.\nJames Walter, MD\nClinical Fellow; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care; Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine\nOther Posts You May Enjoy\nMikita, J.A. and C.P.

Nov 1995;108(5):1477."", 'In order to carry out robust assessments of the human voice that are useful for diagnosing potential voice disorders, providing baseline data against which therapeutic progress can be assessed, the collection of data for research purposes, and similar, it is advisable to follow an assessment protocol. A protocol is a detailed, often standardized, procedure with clear guidelines regarding the exact method(s) of how to conduct a particular assessment. It sets out what data should be collected, under what conditions, exactly how they should be collected and by whom. Protocols attempt to reach agreement and uniformity concerning methods of voice assessment.\nThere are four main procedures for assessing the human voice for potential voice disorders:\n- case history\n- perceptual assessment\n- instrumental measurement\n- laryngoscopic examination\nThe case history\nThe information routinely collected in a case history will vary from institution to institution. However, a typical data collection is as follows.\nOTOLARYGOLOGY (Ear, Nose and Throat) FINDINGS\ne.g. vocal fold palsy, granuloma, glottic chink, hearing\nMEDICAL HISTORY (including current medications)\ne.g. upper respiratory tract infections, allergies, nasal drip\ne.g. depression, anxiety, panic attacks\n- Symptoms, e.g. soreness, vocal fatigue, dryness\n- Variability, e.g. consistent, worse in morning, worse after being at work\n- Vocal Hygiene, e.g. alcohol intake, caffeine intake\n- Vocal Abuse, e.g. throat clearing, yelling\n- Environmental Issues, e.g. noise, smoke, chemicals\n- Effects on Lifestyle: e.g. social interaction, employment, confidence\nData in this category may also be gathered using self-completed questionnaires. These typically investigate the client’s own perceptions (or primary caregiver’s perceptions in the case of a young child) of the extent to which their presenting voice difficulty is interfering with their daily living routine; how it affects their quality of life; their perceptions of the type and severity of symptoms, and similar. Example questionnaires include: Voice Symptoms Scale [VoiSS] (Deary et al, 2003), Voice Handicap Index [VHI] (Jacobson et al, 1997), and the Pediatric Voice Handicap Index [pVHI] (Zur et al).\nThe perceptual assessment of voice involves describing a person’s voice only by listening to it.\nThere are several published protocols to assist perceptual assessment. One such protocol is the GRBAS Scale (Hirano, 1981) which targets only voice quality: describing it in terms of Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia (voice weakness), Strain and the overall Grade of the quality. A more encompassing protocol is the Vocal Profile Analysis protocol (Laver et al., 1981), which examines such things as vocal tract muscle tension, mandibular features as well as phonation type. Despite these protocols having been published several decades ago, they are still in use today in many clinics around the world. That said, as perceptual assessment relies heavily on the clinician’s own training in listening skills, clinicians often devise their own protocols, frequently adopting an eclectic approach that draws on areas of assessment cited in several published assessments. However, this must not be interpreted as being an unprincipled approach: all clinicians will adopt methods that systematically assess/measure relevant vocal parameters.\nSeveral means of obtaining data may be used, e.g. vocal tract imaging, electromyography, electroglottography, acoustic analysis (such as Boersma’s (2020) Praat program). Acoustic analysis frequently assesses Maximum Phonation Time (MPT) and the S/Z Ratio.\nThere are four main methods of laryngoscopic examination for investigating the larynx and vocal tract:\n- mirror laryngoscopy\n- rigid endoscopy\n- flexible nasendoscopy\n- direct laryngoscopy\nBoersma, Paul & Weenink, David (2020).

61	How many times did Jesus sacrifice himself?	Christ offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, and by that single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.	"[""Christ’s Sacrifice Once for All\n10 For since the law has but va shadow wof the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, xit can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year, make perfect those who draw near. 2 Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sins? 3 But yin these sacrifices zthere is a reminder of sins every year. 4 For ait is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.\n5 Consequently, bwhen Christ1 came into the world, he said,\nc“Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired,\nbut a body have you prepared for me;\n6 in burnt offerings and sin offerings\nyou have taken no pleasure.\n7 Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come to do your will, O God,\nas it is written of me in the scroll of the book.’ ”\n8 When he said above, “You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in csacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings” (these are offered according to the law), 9 then he added, d“Behold, I have come to do your will.” He does away with the first in order to establish the second. 10 And by that will ewe have been sanctified through the offering of fthe body of Jesus Christ gonce for all.\n11 And every priest stands hdaily at his service, ioffering repeatedly the same sacrifices, jwhich can never take away sins. 12 But when Christ2 had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he ksat down at the right hand of God, 13 waiting from that time luntil his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet. 14 For by a single offering mhe has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.\n15 And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,\n16 n“This is the covenant that I will make with them\nafter those days, declares the Lord:\nI will put my laws on their hearts,\nand write them on their minds,”\no“I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.”\n18 Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.\n19 pTherefore, brothers,3 since we have confidence to enter qthe holy places by the blood of Jesus, 20 by rthe new and living way that he opened for us through sthe curtain, that is, through his flesh, 21 and since we have ta great priest over the house of God, 22 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts usprinkled clean vfrom an evil conscience and our bodies wwashed with pure water. 23 xLet us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for yhe who promised is faithful. 24 And zlet us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, 25 anot neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and ball the more as you see cthe Day drawing near.\n26 For dif we go on sinning deliberately eafter receiving the knowledge of the truth, fthere no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, 27 gbut a fearful expectation of judgment, and ha fury of fire that will consume the adversaries. 28 iAnyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy jon the evidence of two or three witnesses. 29 How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one kwho has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has profaned lthe blood of the covenant mby which he was sanctified, and has noutraged the Spirit of grace? 30 For we know him who said, o“Vengeance is mine; I will repay.” And again, p“The Lord will judge his people.” 31 qIt is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.\n32 But recall the former days when, after ryou were enlightened, you endured sa hard struggle with sufferings, 33 sometimes being tpublicly exposed to reproach and affliction, and sometimes being partners with those so treated. 34 For uyou had compassion on those in prison, and vyou joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had wa better possession and an abiding one. 35 Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has xa great reward. 36 For yyou have need of endurance, so that zwhen you have done the will of God you may areceive what is promised. 37 For,\nb“Yet a little while,\nand cthe coming one will come and will not delay;\n38 dbut my righteous one shall live by faith,\nand if he shrinks back,\nmy soul has no pleasure in him.”\n39 But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.\nAbout English Standard Version\nThe English Standard Version™ is founded on the conviction that the words of the Bible are the very words of God.

62	How can companies make sure their workers do the right thing?	Companies typically create written codes of conduct that guide employee behavior. These codes include a mission statement expressing core values, followed by specific rules for real-life ethical situations. They cover areas like communicating with the public, interactions between employees, use of company property, and accepting gifts. These codes often appear in employee handbooks alongside other policies on discrimination, compensation, benefits, safety, and information security.	"['Children are often taught that “honesty is the best policy” and to “do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” while law students are instructed that attorneys should “avoid even the appearance of impropriety.” But such lofty idioms and maxims lack the specificity needed to guide business behavior when close-call ethical questions inevitably arise. Fortunately, many professional, business and governmental organizations provide specific guides by which to model ethical behavior.\nCodes of Conduct\nCreating a written code of conduct forces an organization to actively consider and articulate the specific rules by which to guide the behavior of its members. Codes of conduct typically include a mission statement that expresses the core values of the organization followed by substantive sections that anticipate real-life ethical issues and proscribe specific courses of action for each. Codes of conduct should be sufficiently comprehensive to provide meaningful guidance for decision making in all foreseeable situations. The specific circumstances covered often include such issues as arise in communicating with the outside public on behalf of the organization, interactions with superiors, fellow employees and subordinates, use of property of the organization, accepting gifts in the capacity of a member or employee of the organization and the like. Codes of conduct may appear as separate documents or as sections within broader guides, such as employee handbooks.\nMost business organizations provide employees with a comprehensive handbook that communicates the specific expectations it has of its employees. The major sections of employee handbooks typically include provisions relating to non-disclosure agreements, discrimination policies, compensation rules, work-schedule policies, employee benefits, safety, information security, use of company property and leave policies. Employee handbooks often also contain a major section devoted specifically to the standards of conduct that the employee expects of all employees. This section typically follows the format of the comprehensive codes of conduct distributed to the members of other types of organizations and often includes subsections dedicated specifically to conflicts of interest, intellectual property and confidentiality.\nModels for business ethics can also be found in codes adopted by various professional organizations. As with other such codes of conduct, professional codes are designed to assist members of professional organizations in resolving the ethical dilemmas that are likely to arise during the course of their professional careers. Many professional groups are self-regulating -- they determine whether individuals are fit to become and continue as members. Their professional codes are intended not only to establish and communicate the standards to be followed once an individual becomes a member of the organization, but are also used to measure whether a candidate is likely to follow the professional code based upon thorough background checks. The American Bar Association’s ""Model Rules of Professional Conduct"" is typical of professional codes in addressing the competence, diligence, duties and ethics of those licensed to practice law.\nModels for business ethics can also be found in the codes of ethics adopted by government agencies, typical of which is the succinct code promulgated by the U.S. Office of Governmental Ethics. This code of ethics is applicable to all officers and employees of the Executive Branch of the U.S. Government and specifically covers such issues as loyalty to the U.S. Constitution, conflict of interest, acceptance of gifts and gratuities, performance of duties, impartiality, use of government property, outside employment and “actions creating the appearance that they are violating the law or ethical standards” of the U.S. Government.\n“Plus” Decision-Making Model\nThe Ethics Resource Center, a nonprofit organization formed in 1924 for the advancement of high ethical standards in private and public institutions, has proposed a simplified ethics guide that it calls “The Plus Decision Making Model.” The Plus Model defines six steps of ethical decision making, as follows: Define the problem (contrasting what was expected versus the actual circumstances); identify alternatives (all alternatives must be consistent with the stated policies of the organization, applicable law and the decision maker’s own sense of right and wrong); evaluate the alternatives (anticipate the positive and negative consequences of each alternative); make the decision (choose the optimum alternative); implement the decision; evaluate the decision (determine whether the decision in fact resolved the problem).\n- Ethics Resource Center: Why Have a Code of Conduct\n- Ethics Resource Center: Code Construction and Content\n- U.S. Small Business Administration: Employee Handbooks\n- Entrepreneur: Employee Handbook Template\n- American Bar Association: Model Rules of Professional Conduct\n- U.S. Office of Government Ethics: Code of Ethics\n- Ethics Recourse Center: The Plus Decision Making Model\n- Hofstra Law Review; Judicial Ethics, The Appearance of Impropriety, and the Proposed New ABA Judicial Code; Ronald D.

63	ship environmental disasters causes prevention dangerous goods ballast water economic impact	Environmental disasters from ships can occur through dangerous goods spillages and ballast water discharge, both causing severe economic consequences. Dangerous goods accidents, like the 2021 cargo ship fire off Sri Lanka's coast, can create environmental disasters lasting decades. For ballast water, the economic impact is substantial - for example, the introduction of zebra mussels alone in the U.S. Great Lakes has cost approximately $5 billion according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The total economic cost from invasive mollusks in U.S. aquatic ecosystems exceeds $6 billion annually, affecting industries like water utilities, fisheries, agriculture, and tourism. Prevention measures include strict emergency response procedures for dangerous goods and mandatory ballast water management plans under international regulations, requiring specific practices like proper containment methods and ballast water treatment or exchange.	"['A spillage of dangerous goods occurring on a ship can be a frightening and dangerous situation. It is therefore important to know how to act in these circumstances, in order to minimize the risk of harm to yourself, others, and the environment.\nWhen a spillage is first detected, the crew should take immediate action to contain the spillage. This may involve evacuating the area, restricting access and the use of absorbent materials, such as sand, earth, or sawdust, to soak up the liquid. Using firefighting foam may also be necessary to prevent the spread of fire.\nEvery year, several accidents involving the spillage of dangerous goods occur on ships. These accidents can have serious consequences for the environment, the ship’s crew and passengers, and the local community.\nIn 2021, a cargo ship carrying fuel and chemicals caught fire off the coast of Sri Lanka and left in its wake an environmental disaster that the island will likely have to live with for decades. This article will provide guidance on what to do in the event of a dangerous goods spillage on a ship.\nWhat To Do If Spillage Of Dangerous Goods Occurs On A Ship?\nIf a spill involving hazardous materials occurs onboard, it is imperative that the procedures laid out in the ship’s emergency plan be followed. Such responses in the ship’s emergency plan should be based on Emergency Response Procedures (EmS Guide) for specific dangerous goods having regard to, inter alia, the type of ship, the quantity and type of packaging of the dangerous goods, and whether the goods are stowed on or under deck.\nIn addition, crew members should get a rapid general view of the situation and judge the need for the most urgent actions to be taken, such as medical care of victims, restriction of access, evacuation, reduction of leakages, etc.\nThis will involve ascertaining the properties of the goods involved and taking necessary precautions before initiating spillage control operations. The following are the procedures to follow after ascertaining the properties of the spillage.\nNotify The Ship’s Command.\nThe first step is to sound the ship’s general alarm. This will ensure that all crew members are mustered and made aware of the situation so as to be in a position to take appropriate action. It also informs the ship’s master and officers who are normally in charge of vessels’ emergency actions. The alarm should be sounded as soon as the spillage is discovered.\nEvacuate The Area.\nIn the event of a DG spill on a ship, a major priority is to evacuate the area. This is done in order to protect people from potential exposure to hazardous material. Personnel who are not involved in the emergency response should be evacuated from the scene.\nIf it is safe to do so, the vessel should be moved away from the spill area. This will help to minimize the spread of the DG and reduce the potential for environmental damage. Once the area has been evacuated, emergency responders will begin to assess and address the situation.\nContain The Spill\nNext, you will need to contain the spillage. Use any available materials to do so, such as absorbent pads, sand, or earth. It is an international legal requirement to stock and carry such material in the ship’s Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plan (SOPEP) locker. If the spillage is small, you may clean it up yourself. If it is large, or if you are not confident in your ability to clean it up safely, you will need to call for help\nContact The Local Authorities.\nIn the event of a Dangerous Goods spill on a ship, it is important to contact the local authorities as soon as possible. They will be able to provide assistance and guidance on how to deal with the situation. In case of a bigger spill, there might also be a legal requirement to contact the ship’s flag state.\nThe local authorities will likely have a plan in place for dealing with such an event. They will also have the resources necessary to clean up and mitigate the damage caused by the spill. It is important to follow their instructions and cooperate with them fully in order to ensure that the situation is handled as safely and efficiently as possible.\nWhat Is the EmS code For Dangerous Goods?\nEmergency procedures for ships transporting dangerous goods (EMS) are intended to provide direction on what to do in the event of an incident involving certain dangerous materials. The goods included in the EMS are classified according to the IMDG Code and grouped in such a way that goods requiring the same or similar emergency action appear on the same emergency schedule.\nEach emergency plan is broken down into five sections:\n- Group title accompanied by the emergency schedule number.\n- Specialized equipment is required.\n- Emergency response procedures.\n- Emergency actions.\n- Basic first aid.\nThe EmS code is assigned to each UN Number in column 15 of the Dangerous Goods List in the IMDG Code, chapter 3.2. The EmS code comprises two parts – the first part, starting with the letter “F”, is for fire; the second part, starting with the letter “S”, is for spillage\nImportance Of Contingency Plan Onboard Ships.\nWhen goods are being transported by sea, there is always a risk of them spilling and causing a dangerous situation. A contingency plan is always important, but it becomes a matter of life and death when there is a spillage of dangerous goods. In the event of such an accident, it is important for crew members to know how to act quickly and safely. The crew must know what to do in order to minimize the damage.\nThere are three key things that need to be done in the event of a spillage of dangerous goods. First, all crew members need to be aware of the emergency and know what to do. Second, the spillage must be contained and prevented from spreading. Third, the cleanup process must be started as soon as possible. If these steps are not followed, it could lead to a serious accident.\nCrews collect lentil-sized plastic pellets from a Sri Lankan beach. By one estimate, the X-Press Pearl was carrying some 75 billion of these pellets when it sank off the coast of Colombo.

This plan is designed to minimize the damage and potential health risks associated with a spill and to ensure that the proper authorities are notified and responders are dispatched as quickly as possible.\nThe emergency schedule for DG spillage on a ship will vary depending on the specific situation and the type of hazardous material involved. However, some key steps that are typically included in this plan are:\n- Notifying the captain and crew\n- Securing the area around the spill\n- Containment and cleanup of the hazardous material.\nKeeping international trade moving entails carrying dangerous goods. As with all cargoes, accidents do happen and despite the dangers associated with the carrying of such cargoes, a well-trained crew is the best team to deal with fires on board ships resulting from DG spills. Keeping this in mind onboard training must include EmS to enable the ship crew to be well prepared for incidents involving fire or spillage.', 'Ballast water discharge and the environment\nBallast water discharges by ships can have a negative impact on the marine environment. The discharge of ballast water and sediments by ships is governed globally under the Ballast Water Management Convention, since its entry into force in September 2017. It is also controlled through national regulations, which may be separate from the Convention, such as in the United States.\nCruise ships, large tankers, and bulk cargo carriers use a huge amount of ballast water, which is often taken on in the coastal waters in one region after ships discharge wastewater or unload cargo, and discharged at the next port of call, wherever more cargo is loaded. Ballast water discharge typically contains a variety of biological materials, including plants, animals, viruses, and bacteria. These materials often include non-native, nuisance, exotic species that can cause extensive ecological and economic damage to aquatic ecosystems, along with serious human health issues including death.\nThere are hundreds of organisms carried in ballast water that cause problematic ecological effects outside of their natural range. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) lists the ten most unwanted species as:\n- Cholera Vibrio cholerae (various strains)\n- Cladoceran Water Flea Cercopagis pengoi\n- Mitten Crab Eriocheir sinensis\n- Toxic algae (red/brown/green tides) (various species)\n- Round Goby Neogobius melanostomus\n- North American Comb Jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi\n- North Pacific Seastar Asterias amurensis\n- Zebra Mussel Dreissena polymorpha\n- Asian Kelp Undaria pinnatifida\n- European Green Crab Carcinus maenas\nBallast water issues by country\nThe ballast tanks in New Zealand carry animals and plants that kill ecosystems. Ballast tanks are only used in cargo ships there. Ballast water is controlled under the Biosecurity Act 1993.\nThe zebra mussel, which is native to the Caspian and Black Seas, arrived in Lake St. Clair in the ballast water of a transatlantic freighter in 1988. Within 10 years it had spread to all of the five neighbouring Great Lakes. The economic cost of this introduction has been estimated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at about $5 billion.\nBallast water discharges are believed to be the leading source of invasive species in U.S. marine waters, thus posing public health and environmental risks, as well as significant economic cost to industries such as water and power utilities, commercial and recreational fisheries, agriculture, and tourism. Studies suggest that the economic cost just from introduction of pest mollusks (zebra mussels, the Asian clam, and others) to U.S. aquatic ecosystems is more than $6 billion per year.\nCongress passed the National Invasive Species Act in 1996 in order to regulate ballast water discharges. The Coast Guard issued ballast water regulations in 2012. Under the authority of the Clean Water Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published its latest Vessel General Permit in 2013. The permit sets numeric ballast water discharge limits for commercial vessels 79 feet (24 m) in length or greater. EPA issued a separate permit for smaller commercial vessels in 2014.\nAmong 818 ports in the Pacific region, Singapore alone accounts for an estimated of 26 percent of cross-region (long range) species exchange. Via targeted ballast management on Singapore and a few other ""influential"" ports, cross-region species exchange to/from the Pacific region can be combinatorially reduced.\nTo react to the growing concerns about environmental impact of ballast water discharge, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted in 2004 the ""International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships\' Ballast Water and Sediments"" to control the environmental damage from ballast water. The Convention will require all ships to implement a ""Ballast water management plan"" including a ballast water record book and carrying out ballast water management procedures to a given standard. Guidelines are given for additional measures then the guidelines.\nThe goals of the convention are to minimise damage to the environment by:\n- Minimise the uptake of organisms during ballasting.\n- Minimising the uptake of sediments during ballasting.\n- Ballast water exchange while at sea (the ship should be minimum 200 nautical miles from shore with a depth of minimum 200 metres and can use the flow through or sequential method). At least 95 percent of the total ballast water should be exchanged.\n- Treatment of the ballast water by chemical or mechanical influences (UV-radiation, filter, deoxygenation, cavitation, ozone…)\nControl measures include:\n- International Ballast Water Management Certificate\n- Ballast water management plan\n- Ballast water record book\nThe IMO convention was ratified by enough countries and entered into force on September 8, 2017.\n- ""International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships\' Ballast Water and Sediments"".

64	I'm interested in ancient mythology and heard about a goddess who helped deliver her own twin brother - can you tell me who she was and what happened to her?	This was Artemis, the Greek goddess (known to Romans as Diana). Though newly born, she helped deliver her twin brother Apollo and witnessed her mother Leto's difficult birth. This experience traumatized her so much that she vowed to remain unmarried and childless, though she didn't vow celibacy. She became the goddess of the moon and hunt, and was worshipped throughout the Greco-Roman world, particularly at Ephesus and Marseilles.	"['Friday, May 21, 2010\nFew herbs have been so steeped in legend and liquid as Wormwood. The botanical name of the genus is Artemisia (pronounced ar-te-MIZ-ee-ah, or ar-tuh-MEEZ-yuh, in the South). Artemisia is in the Asteraceae or daisy family. There are over 200 species native to the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Most are found in dry climates. Many of the species are known for their volatile oils useful for medicine and flavoring.\nAs the name suggests, Artemisia might have been named for the Greek goddess Artemis, also known among Romans as Diana, goddess of the hunt. Artemis was a vindictive charmer. Though newly born, she observed the difficult birth of her twin brother, Apollo, and helped her mom, Leto, deliver. So traumatized by the pain which her mother experienced, Artemis vowed to remain unmarried and childless. Celibacy, however, was not part of her vow.\nInsults, real or imagined, stirred her wrath. She was especially protective of her mother. Proud Niobe, daughter of Tantalus, made the mistake of insulting Leto, so Artemis assassinated all her children. Tityus tried to rape Leto, and paid with his life. Actaeon, who accidentally saw Artemis naked, was turned into a stag and torn apart by hounds.\nArtemis was passionately in love with young Dardamis of Abydos. He, however, failed to appreciate her beauty and return her affection. As her final act of cruelty, she poked his eyes out while he slept, then committed suicide.\nArtemis, goddess of the moon and of the hunt, was worshiped throughout the Greco-Roman world, principally at Ephesus and Marseilles. She was also the patron goddess of amazons and unmarried women. Human sacrifices, presumably male, may have been among the ceremonies.\nBut there was another Artemis for whom the plant might have been named: Artemisia II of Carius. This stunning beauty was wife and sister of King Mausolus. She was an unusually able queen and admiral of her own fleet. Botany and plant collecting were among her interests. Upon the death of her husband, she was stricken with such extraordinary grief that she mixed some of his ashes with her daily draught. To preserve his memory, she commissioned the building of a majestic monument, a mausoleum, at Halicarnassus to his honor. Artemis II never saw it completed. She died in 350 BC, two years after her husband.\nNow, Artemisia, the genus, is as legendary. Two common names, Wormwood and Mugwort, are shared among many of the species, indicating some uses. Wormwood is derived from Artemisia\'s use as a repellant of moths, fleas and worms. Mugwort is derived from its use as a flavoring in beverages, particularly beer and wine. It was originally an ingredient in vermouth.\nA. annua, Sweet Wormwood, is an ingredient in anti-malarial therapy.\nA. arborescens, Tree Wormwood, is native to the Middle East. Very bitter, it is mixed with mint to concoct a drink appropriately known in Israel as Shiva, or ""Queen of Sheba.""\nIn addition to its use as a vermifuge, A. absinthium was the key ingredient in absinthe - that notorious green spirit favored by bohemians which was said to eventually caused blindness, abstract paintings and lunarcy.\nA. dracunculus, also known as Tarragon, is a mild-flavored wormwood often used as a culinary herb. In fact, I shall use some tonight on my grilled sea trout.\nA. stelleriana (Dusty Miller) and A. schmidtiana are popular ornamental plants. They are often planted in ""moon gardens"" because of their silvery sheen and association with Artemis, goddess of the moon.\nArtemisia has been used to wean children from their mother\'s breasts by rubbing the bitter extract on nipples. Fair Juliet was ablactated just so.\nA. vulgaris contains thujone, which is also found in arborvitae (meaning ""tree of life""). Arborvitae (Thuja or Platycladus) shrubs are often planted in cemeteries as symbols. Anyway, thujone is claimed to have many healing properties, and may actually possess them. But it can be toxic. Oh well, of such is life.\nSpeaking of toxic, A. vulgaris is also referred to in the Ukrainian name, Chernobyl, which means ""place where the mugwort grows."" Mugwort is known to be an invasive weed that inhabits waste places. The notorious site was named Chernobyl, perhaps prophetically, before the nuclear (properly pronounced NEW-kew-lahr) meltdown.\nThe same species has been used to flavor roasted Christmas geese, to smoke, and to tuck into pillows to induce vivid dreams. Its common names include Felon Herb, Sailor\'s Tobacco, and Naughty Man - all of which suggest trickery and something to be avoided.\nIn addition to Shakespeare\'s Romeo and Juliet, wormwood has figured in other great literary works such as C.S. Lewis\'s Screwtape Letters, Shakespeare\'s Hamlet, Rowling\'s The Draught of Living Death, and in St. John\'s Revelation.\nArtemisia species are suitable for perennial borders, herb gardens, fragrance gardens, butterfly gardens and container gardens. Most are semi-evergreen to evergreen, depending upon the climate zone. Height varies.\nArtemisia thrives in well-drained to dry soil. Take care not to over-water. There is little need to fertilize. Hardiness and pH range vary by species. Since Artemisia is drought tolerant, it\'s perfect for xeriscaping.\nBegin by taking a soil sample to your local Cooperative Extension Service office for testing. The results will specify any soil amendments needed.\nPrepare the planting bed by cultivating at least 6"" deep, removing all traces of weeds. Compacted soil should be cultivated to 10"" deep. Add enough soil to raise the bed at least 4"" above the surrounding ground level. This will help to promote good drainage. A little compost may be incorporated into the soil.\nPlant spacing varies by species. Dig planting holes into the cultivated soil a little less deep than the depth of the growing container. Water the plants in the pots, then drain. Place the plants into the holes and back-fill, watering as you go. Press soil around the root balls. Do not cover entirely the root balls with soil. The tops should be slightly exposed. Add a top-dressing of mulch around the plants, not on top of them, about 1"" deep.\nPlant Artemisia with other plants having similar cultural requirements. If you do fertilize, do so sparingly and allow soil to dry between watering.\nArtemisia benefits from occasional pruning, but take care not to cut back into old wood. Prune only during the growing season; do not prune in fall or winter.\nArtemisia has no serious pests or diseases, and deer don\'t like it. The greatest cause of failure is planting it in an environment that is not to its liking.\nCertainly, a plant as interesting as Artemisia should be in your garden.\nReturn to Artemisia at goGardenNow.com.']"	['<urn:uuid:1b7234a2-792e-486f-9589-a9978f0ca37c>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	30	68	1097

66	What makes digging through mountains so difficult?	Tunneling through mountains presents multiple challenges. In the Andes Mountains, engineers faced extreme conditions including over 400 fault lines, temperatures exceeding 54 degrees Celsius (130 degrees Fahrenheit), and more than 16,000 rock bursting events. The high overburden of up to 2,000 meters created additional complications. Similarly, in Norway's Ulriken project, challenging factors included rock mass fracturing and high rock strength (UCS). These conditions affect the tunneling speed and require careful consideration of parameters like cutter thrust and extensive geological testing to ensure safe and efficient excavation.	['The New Ulriken Tunnel - TBM Performance Prediction in Hard Rock\nMetadataVis full innførsel\nA new railway tunnel through the mountain of Ulriken is constructed from Arna to Bergen, Norway. The tunnel project is named the New Ulriken Tunnel, and is constructed with a combination of drill and blast and Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM). This is the first time a TBM is used to construct a railway tunnel in Norway. Consequently, this thesis is written in relation with the New Ulriken Tunnel with the main objective to study and compare different prediction models for TBM. Seven models were chosen, and will be presented and calculated individually. The different models are: - The NTNU-model- A model by Farrokh et al. (2012) presented in the journal Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology- A model by Hassanpour et al. (2011) presented in the journal Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology- The Gehring model- The Apline model (modified Gehring)- The QTBM-model- The CSM- and MCSM-model (Modified CSM) At last, the different results are compared towards each other as well as the achieved net penetration rate at the New Ulriken Tunnel. This comparison will give a deeper understanding of the models and how they behave with different input values. The models require multiple input parameters, consisting of both machine and geological data. Thus, gathering field data at the New Ulriken Tunnel project has been a priority in this thesis. Over a period of eight weeks detailed mapping of the rock, various tests with the machine, and drilling of core samples were conducted. A 700-meter section of the tunnel was investigated, from TM 3775 TM 4475. In addition, TBM machine data was collected through an automatic logging system. This software logs every 10th second, providing a vast amount of data. After the collection of necessary data was completed, the in-situ samples were taken back to the laboratory and tested. The combination of the data was later put together and calculations of the different models were carried out. Several spreadsheets are created in Microsoft Excel, creating a large amount of graphs and tables. The different spreadsheets display calculations and results for the geological investigation, TBM performance data, penetration- and RPM tests, chip analysis, and model performance predictions. The organization and calculations of this data in Excel have been a time-consuming activity. All results presented in this thesis are an outcome of this work. All the used methodologies contain possible sources of error. Therefore, a thorough review of methodologies, calculations and results has been completed. When all the needed parameters are established the prediction models can be calculated. The predicted net penetration rates from each model are compared to what has been achieved at the selected tunnel segment at the New Ulriken Tunnel. The results indicate that the model by Hassanpour et al. and the Alpine model show the most promising predictions. These models estimate net penetration rates very close to what has been achieved at the New Ulriken Tunnel. However, if a conservative result is more sought after, the Gehring model calculates the best values. The study of the different models shows that cutter thrust, rock mass fracturing, and UCS are the machine and geological parameters most affecting the net penetration rate. It is therefore important that the models include these parameters to better reflect real situations. Cutter ring life has been calculated using the NTNU-model. The estimations show good correlation with the actual cutter consumption while using achieved net penetration rates from the New Ulriken Tunnel. The results in this thesis show that TBM prediction models are a good tool for project management. Predictions are relevant both for the early stages as well as during the construction of a project. However, more than one prediction model should be calculated to ensure a reliable result.', 'Olmos Trans-Andean Tunnel\nMain Beam TBM tunnels below High Cover in the Andes Mountains\n|Machine Type||Main Beam TBM|\n|Diameter||5.3 m (17.4 ft)|\n|Tunnel Type||Water Transfer|\n|Tunnel Length||12.5 km (7.7 mi)|\n|Owner||Peruvian National Government and Lambayeque Regional Government|\n|Contractor||Odebrecht Peru Ingenieria y Construccion, S.A.C. (OPIC)|\nThe Olmos Trans-Andean tunnel has been more than 100 years in the making, with several attempts made in the 1950’s using drill and blast techniques. The tunnel, more than 20 km (12 mi) long in total, is part of a larger scheme to transfer water from the Huancabamba River on the Eastern side of the Andes to drought-ridden areas on the Pacific Ocean Watershed via a tunnel bored through the continental divide. The first phase included 43 m (140 ft) high dam diverting the Huancabamba River near the village of San Felipe through the mountains to the dry Olmos River on the Pacific side. Now that the first phase of the tunnel project is operational, the scheme will supply more than 2 billion cubic meters (500 billion gallons) of water annually for irrigation of 560 km2 (130,000 acres) of farmland. Phases to follow will include at least two more drill and blast tunnels, two hydroelectric stations generating 600 MW each, and a canal system to filter water throughout the coast.\nIn July 2004, General contractor Concesionaria Trasvace Olmos, S.A. won a 20-year build-operate concession from the Peruvian National Government and Lambayeque Regional Government. In March 2007, the 5.3 m (17.4 ft) Robbins TBM was launched for sub-contractor Odebrecht Peru Ingenieria y Construccion, S.A.C (OPIC). The TBM was designed to bore a 12.5 km (7.7 mi) long tunnel through the Andes Mountains beneath up to 2,000 m (6,500 ft) of hard, potentially squeezing rock.\nGeology and Machine Design\nThe machine bored through complex geology consisting of quartz porphyry, andesite, and tuff from 60 to 225 MPa (8,700 to 32,600 psi) UCS. Over 400 fault lines were present along the tunnel route, including two major fault lines approximately 50 m (160 ft) wide.\nThe overburden created another problem — high in-tunnel temperatures exceeded 54 degrees Celsius (130 degrees Fahrenheit). To cope with the high temperature Robbins designed the machine with a unique ventilation and air cooling system. Two interacting systems were used to cool the tunnel to 32 degrees Celsius (90 degrees Fahrenheit) or below. The high jobsite elevation (1,080 m / 3,500 ft) resulted in less dense air and less heat transfer capacity per cubic meter of air, so the two systems made it possible to blow more air into the tunnel for a maximum cooling effect.\nStarting in late 2008, the TBM entered sections of high cover where crews experienced large overbreaks and cathedralling, along with over 16,000 recorded rock bursting events that could not be contained using wire mesh, rock bolts and ring beams. To better contain the fractured rock, Robbins and Odebrecht elected to make changes by installing a novel type of TBM ground support. The machine’s roof shield fingers were removed and replaced with the McNally Support System (see photo at right).\nThe McNally system works by replacing the curved finger shield plate for a curved assembly of pockets with rectangular cross-sections. The pockets extend axially from the rear side of the cutterhead to the cutterhead support, within the area where roof drills can work. Before a TBM stroke, crews slide slats of metal or wood into the pockets, such that the slats are two rows deep inside each pocket. The ends of the slats protrude from the pockets and are bolted to the roof of the tunnel using a steel strap. As the machine advances, the slats are extruded from the pockets and continuously bolted to the roof using subsequent straps. Slats are reloaded and used for the length of the tunnel to prevent deformation and rock falls.\nTunneling through the fractured and broken rock also created undue wear on the cutterhead. To cope with the problem, Robbins engineers added 19 mm (0.75 in) thick wear plates and 50 mm (2.0 in) thick square bars, known as ‘Boomerangs’, in front of each cutter. The boomerangs protect each cutter hub from blocky rock and bursting at the face.\nThe above modifications to the TBM led to steadily improved advance rates, with the machine boring as much as 674 m (2,211 ft) per month. The improved rates are all the more remarkable considering two hazardous local floods in April 2008 and March 2009, which both inundated the site with more than a meter of mud and wiped out access roads.\nAfter four years of extreme excavation and challenging geologic conditions, the TBM reached the end of its route on December 20, 2011. Government officials, including the President of Peru, were among onlookers of the epic breakthrough.']	['<urn:uuid:c092074b-44d9-4b55-8593-45b71b74d5fe>', '<urn:uuid:c24e3f34-1d0e-4926-bad8-a8be860aef7e>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	7	86	1418

HDMI 2.0 has improved with 600 MHz total dual-link pixel clocks, enabling resolutions of 3840x2160 at 60 Hz.	['NVIDIA G-Sync: Death of the Refresh Rate\nIntroduction of LCD Monitors\nCRT displays were used on computers since the very earliest days as they replaced the arrays of light bulbs used for information output. In the 1980s though the CRT went through a revolution as the capabilities were improved from monochrome to 16 colors and resolutions of 640x540 (EGA) were reached.\nLCD monitors (liquid crystal display) were first introduced to consumers in the mid-1990s at high prices and relatively low image quality compared to the CRT displays at the time. LCD manufacturers were forced to integrate the completely new display technology on the existing display controller infrastructure that was dominated by the CRT. Part of this integration was the adoption of a refresh rate even though from a technical point of few, LCDs functioned very differently.\nLCDs produce an image on the screen with the combination of a persistent back light (CCFL, LED) and by direct voltage application. These pixels can be updated without interference from or with other segments of the display, in any order or at any rate. There is also no need to refresh the pixels in an LCD due to the CRT limitation called phosphor persistence as the pixels do not go dark between refreshes. This means that there is effectively no minimum refresh rate for LCD panels. (Though, in extreme cases of sub-15 FPS instances, a refresh might be necessary to avoid visible light variance.)\nASUS VG248QE - a 144 Hz Refresh LCD Monitor\nBecause LCD monitors don’t have a collection of electron beams that “paint” the screen and don’t need to reset back to a starting position, they do not have a technical reliance on a fixed update rate. Instead, LCD monitors are limited by the update rate of the crystal and silicon used in manufacturing. Today we call that period the response time. There are lots of debates currently about exactly how to measure it (grey to grey, etc.) but this rate is completely independent of the refresh rate as it stands today.\nA display, LCD or CRT, at the time required the use of an analog to digital converter that was responsible for taking in the signal from the graphics system of a computer and translating that into the digital data that would be painted on the display. The controllers inside these displays were receiving data from the computer at a fixed rate that was related to the refresh rate of the CRT. Early LCDs used very similar electronics for the analog conversion and adopted the refresh rate along with them. It wasn’t until 2003 that LCD displays first outsold their CRT competitors and by that time refresh rates on LCDs were fully integrated.\nIntegration of Refresh Rates Today\nThose of us old enough to remember CRTs as the dominant display type will remember the idea of having different refresh rate options for your monitor. High end monitors could run at 60 Hz, 75 Hz, 100 Hz, etc. to improve visual quality all while running at different resolutions (CRTs had no “native” resolution). A technology called EDID (extended display information data) was created in 1994 to allow a monitor to pass information to the computer system to indicate the available resolutions and refresh rates the monitor supported.\nWith that information, it is up to the graphics card to set and indicate the refresh rate back to the display. (This explains how you can create custom resolutions and timings in a GPU driver that may not be accepted by your monitor.) In fact, the scan rate is controlled by a signal called “vertical blanking” that is sent to the monitor, used with CRTs to give the electron guns time to move from their finishing position (bottom right) back to the starting position (top left), ready to draw another frame on the screen.\nLCDs today do not need this signal as there are no electron gun to reposition. So why have LCD manufacturers continued to implement static refresh rates of 60 Hz, 120 Hz or even 144 Hz?\nThe answer lies in the connectivity options and controllers powering displays that are available today. As the analog signals of VGA were replaced with the likes of DVI and HDMI, these higher speed, digital connection options had to conform to existing interface patterns to maintain compatibility with older output types. How many DVI-I to VGA passive adapters do you have laying around with your graphics card?\nDVI, HDMI and early versions of DisplayPort transmit display data in multiples of a refresh rate. A pixel clock is simply a timing circuit provided to divide an incoming scan line of video into individual pixels. The simplicity of the math might surprise you:\n2720 pixels * 1646 pixels * 60 Hz = 268.628 MHz pixel clock\nBreakdown of current Display Timing Variables\nThe extra pixels on each dimension (160 on horizontal, 46 on the vertical) are actually part of the legacy CRT standard that include room for sync width and front/back porch which are meant to space out signal and synchronization communications. This gives time for the electron guns to reposition.\nIf you look at DVI and HDMI specifications you will often see the performance rated by maximum pixel clock. DVI is limited to 165 MHz per link or resolution equivalents of 1920x1200 @ 60 Hz and 1280x1024 @ 85 Hz. Recent updates to HDMI 2.0 have enabled 600 MHz total dual-link pixel clocks for resolutions of 3840x2160 @ 60 Hz.\nDisplayPort introduced a self-clock feature while also supporting HDMI and DVI pixel clocks for backwards compatibility but readers of PC Perspective are also aware some active adapters are required for conversion to DVI/HDMI connectivity. These adapters communicate with the graphics controller on the computer to negotiate speeds and convert the protocol and signal.\nSo even though DisplayPort and HDMI can technically support some impressive bandwidth rates (17.28 Gbps for DP 1.2) they are working with legacy logic that makes them slow and “lazy”. The connectivity is there to push much higher screen refresh rates than we are accustomed to without some of the complications that occur with modern graphics cards and monitors.\nThe question you should be asking yourself now is: what happens if you completely re-write the logic of communications between a GPU and a monitor?']	['<urn:uuid:fdbd476f-7a58-4d80-8d88-fdc11df85e5a>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	12	38	1049
68	What determines diplomatic immunity loss timing and how does this affect children's nationality rights?	Diplomatic immunity typically terminates when a diplomat leaves their official capacity as recognized by their origin country, rather than when the host country receives notice of this change. This timing is crucial for determining children's nationality rights. For example, in cases like Hoda Muthana's, her citizenship status depended on whether her father still had diplomatic immunity at her birth. Additionally, international law emphasizes that every child has the fundamental right to acquire a nationality, with special protections when they would otherwise be stateless. Countries must implement specific safeguards to ensure this right is protected in practice.	['International media has spotlighted the controversial case of Hoda Muthana–a New Jersey born University of Alabama student turned ISIS recruit. Having become disenchanted with her adopted extremist ideology, and now being responsible for her 18-month-old infant, Ms. Muthana wants to return to her native U.S. home and face justice for her criminal acts.\nThe U.S. Department of State is demurring her request for a passport, passage, and prosecution, and is further insisting she was never a citizen of the United States at all. Her father has filed suit on her behalf citing that she was born in the United States, has been issued two passports by the United States, and has never had her citizenship previously questioned.\nNoting that the Department of State is not arguing Ms. Muthana renounced her citizenship during her odyssey of terrorist accessory to Damascus, outside observers are understandably confused.\nFor reasonably archaic reasons explained below, this case could be decided on one question of fact: Did her father, Ahmed Ali Muthana, have diplomatic immunity in the United States at the time of her birth?\nTo answer this question I will define “birthright citizenship,” explain the Parental Diplomatic Immunity Exception, and conclude by applying the law as it exists today to the facts of this case.\nBirthright Citizenship Defined\nThe United States is among few countries in the world that offers “birthright citizenship.” The origin of this right is Section 1 of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which in part declares: “All persons born . . . in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.” The general rule, therefore, is if a person is born within the physical territory of the United States (including U.S. territories, and in many cases, overseas U.S. embassies, and U.S. military bases) that person is automatically a citizen of the Land of the Free.\nIf a suicide bomber births a baby en route to her high profile target at a D.C. children’s hospital, that baby enjoys an unequivocal right to U.S. citizenship, no matter how deplorable a parents’ behavior.\nThe Parental Diplomatic Immunity Exception to Birthright Citizenship\nThere are, though there is no reason any normal person would have ever heard of them, exceptions to birthright citizenship.\nThe exception relevant to this case: If the child is born physically in the United States, but is shielded by diplomatic immunity through the diplomatic status of a parent, the child is not “subject to the jurisdiction of the United States” and is therefore not entitled to birthright citizenship.\nTherefore, if Ahmed Ali Muthana, a former Yemeni diplomat to the United Nations, enjoyed diplomatic immunity at the time of his daughter’s birth, the government’s argument goes, then Ms. Muthana has never been, and continues not to be, a U.S. citizen.\nHoda Muthana was born after her father ceased to be a diplomat, but before the United States was notified that he was no longer a diplomat.\nAhmed Ali Muthana was a Yemini diplomat to the U.N., living in the United States (for International Law purposes, the country a diplomat lives in is called the “host country” and the country he represents is the “origin country.”) As a Yemini diplomat, he was shielded from the jurisdiction of his host country (the United States) by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961)–more casually referred to as “diplomatic immunity.” His term of office ended on September 1, 1994, more than a month before, his daughter, Hoda Muthana, was born on October 28, 1994. The U.S. Mission to the U.N. was notified that Mr. Muthana was no longer a diplomat on February 6, 1995–more than three months after his daughter was born.\nThe question of law is this: Does an outgoing diplomat lose jurisdictional immunity from a host country at the time the diplomat’s origin country (in this case Yemen) ceases to recognize his diplomatic status, or at the time the host country is given notice that he has ceased to be a diplomat?\nThere is a necessary prequal question to this that requires the reader to journey into the obscure abyss of transnational conflict of law: What if Yemen ceased to recognize Mr. Muthana as having diplomatic immunity on September 1, 1994, but the United States, for its own jurisdictional purposes, recognized it through February 6, 1995.?\nU.S. courts, in determining jurisdiction at the time of Hoda Muthana’s birth, will apply the Law of the United States even if they conflict with the Law of Yemen.\nAbsent superseding language in the Vienna Convention or a relevant treaty to which both the U.S. and Yemen are signatories that postdates any contradictory U.S. federal statute, a U.S. court would use U.S. Law to determine the date of cessation of diplomatic immunity.\nAs the reader may guess, a court in Yemen may find it more convenient to rely on the Law of Yemen.\n(Please note that, though beyond the scope of this Essay, there are frequent circumstances when U.S. courts will apply the laws of other jurisdictions to domestic proceedings.)\nIn determining U.S. Law, a court would look for guidance in the language of U.S. treaties and statutes. If a court finds relevant direction from both a treaty and a statute, U.S. Constitutional Law requires the court to apply the language of the treaty or statute that came into effect later in time. (Federal statutes and treaties are coequal in authority, so if one contradicts the other, the law created later governs as if it repealed the contradictory language of the other.)\nU.S. law likely terminates diplomatic immunity at the time a diplomat leaves his official capacity as recognized by the origin country.\nThe Vienna Convention, relevant treaties and federal statutes, seem silent on the question of the effect of a delay of notice to a host country on a former diplomat’s diplomatic immunity. Absent authoritative caselaw, international custom, or a history of relevant behavior between the U.S. and other Vienna Convention signatories, courts will reluctantly consider public policy.\nPublic policy strongly supports the view that the U.S. retroactively terminates its recognition of diplomatic immunity at the time a diplomat leaves his official capacity as recognized by the origin country. This is necessary to avoid the potential of the absurd result outlined below.\nWhen discussing the subject of diplomatic immunity the question often arises: “What if a diplomat goes on a killing spree in the host country?”\nSince diplomatic immunity is a right held by the origin country, and not a right held by the diplomat, the origin country can, and often does, waive the diplomatic immunity of a wayward agent abroad. It cannot do this, however, if the unstable agent is not actually recognized by the origin country as having diplomatic status.\nLet’s assume that Yemen stopped recognizing Mr. Muthana’s diplomatic immunity in September of 1994 but that the U.S. generously extended it’s recognition to February 6, 1995 when it received notice of his ceasing to be a diplomat several months prior. With Yemen unable to waive a right it does not acknowledge exists, Mr. Muthana would, arguably, be unprosecutable for any bad behavior in the United States during the interval.\nTo avoid such an absurd result, the U.S. would need to recognize the date Mr. Muthana left his role as diplomat as the effective date of his loss of diplomatic immunity whenever the U.S. was served of actual notice that he was no longer recognized by Yemen as a diplomat.\nSuch is the policy that should be followed whether a recently-ex-diplomat kills a baby, or procreates a new one into existence on U.S. territory.\nSince Hoda Muthana’s father did not have diplomatic immunity at the time of her birth, she was both born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction making her a citizen with the right to return home and subject to U.S. prosecution.\nThis case is more straightforward than commentators and pundits argue. U.S. law likely requires the Department of State to recognize Ahmed Ali Muthana as loosing his diplomatic immunity on September 1, 1994–more than a month before his daughter was born in New Jersey–making both him and her subject to the jurisdiction of the United States at the time of her birth. The 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution therefore bestows upon her birthright citizenship which, absent a revocation of citizenship, survives her treasonous behavior. She and her child are entitled to admission to the United States where she would be immediately taken into custody for her crimes.\nIronically, should it be determined that she is not a citizen of the United States, while she would effectively become a stateless individual, the U.S. would also be giving up jurisdiction to put her on trial for what would otherwise be her crimes against the United States.\nHer practical alternatives are therefore these: Be imprisoned in the Land of the Free, or just be free.', 'Every child has the right to acquire a nationality. This principle, enshrined in international and regional human rights instruments alike, is clear and unambiguous. The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) also specifies that states must ensure the implementation of this right “in particular where the child would otherwise be stateless” (Art. 7(2)), emphasising the particular obligation that states have to identify and remedy situations in which a child would be left without any nationality. This chapter takes a closer look at the mechanics of how this is to be achieved by exploring the theory and use of “safeguards”: specific rules that all countries should have in place and which are designed to kick in when a child faces the prospect of statelessness. Such safeguards form an essential part of the nuts-and-bolts through which every child’s right to a nationality is protected in practice.\nAlthough the topic of legislative safeguards may seem a rather technical one, it would be overstating the complexity to suggest that this is the domain of lawyers and specialists only. In fact, safeguards against childhood statelessness can, and should, be simple and straightforward. The focus must be on the child: has he or she acquired a nationality through the regular operation of the nationality laws of the country or countries with which he or she is connected by birth and parentage? If the answer is no, for whatever reason, the requisite safeguard applies and this is the route through which the child nevertheless secures a nationality.\nThe notion of safeguards protecting children from statelessness is perhaps most readily illustrated through the example of a foundling, in other words, a child who has been abandoned, perhaps on the steps of a hospital or orphanage, and who is then “found” by someone unconnected to the child. The ordinary rules through which all countries in the world confer nationality to a newborn are based on the connection of birth on the territory (jus soli) or to one or more parents who is a national (jus sanguinis), or some combination of the two. In the case of a foundling, the parents of the child are unknown and evidence may also be lacking of exactly where the birth took place. A foundling can therefore appear to satisfy neither the jus soli nor the jus sanguinis link and so fail to acquire a nationality. To address this and realise the right of every child to acquire a nationality, a safeguard for foundlings should be included within the nationality law, providing specifically for the conferral of nationality to a foundling found on the territory of the state through the presumption that he or she was born there to parents who hold that state’s nationality. In this way, responsibility is attributed and a solution is offered for those cases in which the regular rules that apply for acquisition of nationality by a child would otherwise fall short.\nAs this chapter demonstrates, the idea of establishing safeguards to deal with those cases in which a child would otherwise be stateless is widely accepted, but the implementation is not without its challenges. The first essay, by Laura van Waas, Co-Director of the Institute on Statelessness and Inclusion and Assistant Professor at Tilburg Law School in the Netherlands, explains how a ‘safeguards approach’ has permeated international and regional legal frameworks dealing with the avoidance of childhood statelessness since the era of the League of Nations. Such a system allows states to retain significant freedom in the establishment of rules relating to nationality, only requiring special measures for the small minority of cases in which a child is ‘otherwise stateless’. Despite this, as van Waas discusses, there remain significant gaps in the incorporation, formulation and implementation of safeguards, with states too often allowing other considerations to interfere with the realisation of the fundamental right of every child to a nationality. The short piece ‘A nationality for Denny’, that immediately follows the opening essay, offers a stark reminder that the best interests of the child must be the central consideration in the implementation of safeguards because the alternative may be a legal limbo that is severely detrimental to a child’s well-being – for Denny, six years and counting. Thereafter, the essay by Ayalew Getachew Assefa, legal researcher at the Secretariat of the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, takes a closer look at the evolution of safeguards in the African human rights system and how these have been informed by key rights principles such as the best interests of the child. He also offers a flavour of what may come, with a discussion of the draft Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Specific Aspects of the Rights to Nationality and the Eradication of Statelessness in Africa.\nThe next four contributions look at specific contexts in which special measures to safeguard against childhood statelessness are critical. In the short piece by Laura Parker, Protection Officer (statelessness) with UNHCR in Côte d’Ivoire, the central problem is the lack of any parents to help a child secure a nationality. She talks about the problems which resulted from the lack of a safeguard for foundlings in the nationality law of Côte d’Ivoire, in a context of civil war, mass displacement and family separation, and what efforts are now being made to address them. This piece is complemented by a short reflection on the lost children of Côte d’Ivoire, which looks at the stories of three such children. In the essay by Sanoj Rajan, Professor and Dean at the School of Law of Ansal University in India, the challenge is a potential excess of parents. Where a child is born from a surrogacy arrangement, as many as six different individuals could be identified as a parent, yet the operation of conflicting policies on international commercial surrogacy can leave the child with no access to a nationality. As Rajan discusses, this relatively new phenomenon has yet to be met with effective legal solutions. Laurel Townhead’s essay explores the problems that can arise for access to nationality in another relatively uncommon and potentially challenging context: where a baby is born in prison, to a mother who is incarcerated. She reminds us that realising the right of every child to acquire a nationality, without discrimination, demands that no child is overlooked.\nMoving away from the discussion of specific circumstances in which statelessness safeguards are necessary, the chapter closes with two contributions which drive home the fact that more attention is needed for implementation issues in safeguarding against childhood statelessness. The essay by Juliana Vengoechea Barrios offers a fresh take on the often-debated question of whether the most straightforward and effective “safeguard” for the avoidance of childhood statelessness could be the conversion of all countries to a jus soli system. Focusing on the Americas region, where jus soli is prevalent, she scratches beneath the surface to reveal a number of implementation problems that can obstruct access to birth-right citizenship. Liesl Muller presents a series of cases in which children they are assisting in South Africa have confronted seemingly insurmountable obstacles in fulfilling their right to a nationality. The piece demonstrates how even a complex situation can be distilled to a simple problem and, when presented as such, the child rights imperative for solving it becomes clear. The final contribution in this chapter is from Tini Zainudin and offers a personal reflection of one woman’s quest to navigate the legal system of Malaysia and secure a nationality for her stateless child.']	['<urn:uuid:def739d4-5c02-4079-9d6c-d124709e90d0>', '<urn:uuid:0dc2ed40-8604-4b90-964f-ef9d1d93bb39>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	14	96	2737

70	As someone looking into natural hair treatments - what effects do lavender and rosemary oils have on hair health when used topically?	Both oils show benefits for hair health but work differently. Lavender oil, when used in massage, has been shown to help with significant hair regrowth in people with alopecia areata (hair loss). Rosemary oil stimulates hair follicles to lengthen and strengthen hair, prevents hair loss, slows graying, and helps with dry scalp and dandruff. When combined with olive oil in a hot oil treatment, rosemary has traditionally been used to darken and strengthen hair.	"['Lavender is an herbal remedy used to treat ailments ranging from insomnia and anxiety to depression and mood disturbances. Learn about the usage, dosage, side-effects of Lavender.\nBotanical Name:Lavandula angustifolia\nCommon Names:English lavender, French lavender\n- Plant Description\n- Parts Used\n- Medicinal Uses and Indications\n- Available Forms\n- How to Take It\n- Possible Interactions\nMany people appreciate lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) for its aromatic fragrance, used in soaps, shampoos, and sachets for scenting clothes. The name lavender comes from the Latin root lavare, which means ""to wash."" Lavender most likely earned this name because it was frequently used in baths to help purify the body and spirit. However, this herb is also considered a natural remedy for a range of ailments from insomnia and anxiety to depression and mood disturbances. Recent studies bear out years of anecdotal evidence showing that lavender produces calming, soothing, and sedative effects.\nLavender is native to the mountainous zones of the Mediterranean where it grows in sunny, stony habitats. Today, it flourishes throughout southern Europe, Australia, and the United States. Lavender is a heavily branched short shrub that grows to a height of roughly 60 centimeters. Its broad rootstock bears woody branches with erect, rod-like, leafy, green shoots. A silvery down covers the gray-green narrow leaves, which are oblong and tapered, attached directly at the base, and curled spirally.\nThe oil in lavender\'s small, blue-violet flowers is what gives the herb its fragrant scent. The flowers are arranged in spirals of 6 to 10 blossoms, forming interrupted spikes above the foliage.\nEssential oil is extracted from the fresh flowers of the lavender plant and used for medicinal purposes.\nAlthough professional herbalists and aromatherapists use lavender to treat a variety of conditions (described later), clinical studies thus far have only demonstrated benefit for insomnia and alopecia (hair loss).\nLavender for Insomnia and Reduced Anxiety\nIn folklore, pillows were filled with lavender flowers to help the restless fall sleep. There is now scientific evidence to suggest that aromatherapy with lavender slows the activity of the nervous system, improves sleep quality, promotes relaxation, and lifts mood in people suffering from sleep disorders. Studies also suggest that massage with essential oils, particularly lavender, may result in improved sleep quality, more stable mood, increased mental capacity, and reduced anxiety. In one recent study, participants who received massage with lavender felt less anxious and more positive than participants who received massage alone. Lavender flowers have also been approved by the Commission E in Germany as a tea for insomnia, restlessness, and nervous stomach irritations.\nIn one study of 86 people with alopecia areata (a disease of unknown cause characterized by significant hair loss, generally in patches), those who massaged their scalps with lavender and other essential oils daily for 7 months experienced significant hair re-growth compared to those who massaged their scalps without the essential oils. It is not entirely clear from this study whether lavender (or a combination of lavender and other essential oils) was responsible for the beneficial effects.\nOther including Lavender for Headaches and Exhaustion\nAromatherapists also use lavender as a tonic in inhalation therapy to treat headaches, nervous disorders, and exhaustion. Herbalists treat skin ailments, such as fungal infections (like candidiasis), wounds, eczema, and acne, with lavender oil. It is also used externally in a healing bath for circulatory disorders and as a rub for rheumatic ailments (conditions affecting the muscles and joints). One study evaluating essential oils, including lavender, for treating children with eczema concluded that the oils added no benefit to therapeutic touch from the mother; in other words massage with and without essential oils was equally effective in improving the dry, scaly skin lesion.\nCommercial preparations are made from dried flowers and essential oils of the lavender plant. These preparations are available in the following forms:\n- Aromatherapy oil\n- Bath gels\n- Whole, dried flowers\n- Oral use in children is not recommended.\n- May be used topically in diluted concentrations to treat skin injuries.\n- May be used as aromatherapy for children.\nThe following are recommended adult doses for lavender:\n- Internal use: Tea: 1 to 2 tsp whole herb per cup of water.\n- Tincture (1:4): 20 to 40 drops three times a day.\n- Inhalation: 2 to 4 drops in 2 to 3 cups of boiling water; inhale vapors for headache, depression, or insomnia.\n- Topical external application: lavender oil is one of the few oils that can be safely applied undiluted. For ease of application, add 1 to 4 drops per tablespoon of base oil.\nThe use of herbs is a time-honored approach to strengthening the body and treating disease. Herbs, however, contain active substances that can trigger side effects and interact with other herbs, supplements, or medications. For these reasons, herbs should be taken with care, under the supervision of a practitioner knowledgeable in the field of botanical medicine.\nAlthough side effects are rare, some individuals may develop an allergic reaction to lavender. Nausea, vomiting, headache, and chills have also been reported in some individuals following inhalation or absorption of lavender through the skin.\nPregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid using lavender.\nLavender and CNS Depressants\nAlthough there are no known scientific reports of interactions between lavender and conventional medications, this herb could potentially enhance the effects of central nervous system depressants including narcotics (such as mophine) for pain and benzodiazepines (such as lorazepam, diazepam, and alprazolam) for anxiety and sleep. People taking these medications should consult a healthcare provider before trying lavender.\nback to: Herbal Treatments Homepage\nAnderson C, Lis-Balchin M, Kifk-Smith M.

Retrieved on 2020, May 28 from https://www.healthyplace.com/alternative-mental-health/herbal-treatments/lavender', 'Rosemary Oil; Benefits of Therapeutic Use\nRosemary is a fragrant herb that is native to the Mediterranean and receives its name from the Latin words “ros” (dew) and “marinus” (sea), which means “dew of the Sea.” It also grows in England, Mexico, the USA, and northern Africa, namely in Morocco. Known for its distinctive fragrance that is characterized by an energizing, evergreen, citrus-like, herbaceous scent, Rosemary Essential Oil is derived from the aromatic herb Rosmarinus Officinalis, a plant belonging to the Mint family, which includes Basil, Lavender, Myrtle, and Sage. Its appearance, too, is similar to Lavender with flat pine needles that have a light trace of silver.\nHistorically, Rosemary was considered sacred by the ancient Greeks, Egyptians, Hebrews, and Romans, and it was used for numerous purposes. The Greeks wore Rosemary garlands around their heads while studying, as it was believed to improve memory, and both the Greeks and the Romans used Rosemary in almost all festivals and religious ceremonies, including weddings, as a reminder of life and death. In the Mediterranean, Rosemary leaves and Rosemary Oil was popularly used for culinary preparation purposes, while in Egypt the plant, as well as its extracts, were used for incense. In the Middle Ages, Rosemary was believed to be able to ward off evil spirits and to prevent the onset of the bubonic plague. With this belief, Rosemary branches were commonly strewn across floors and left in doorways to keep the disease at bay. Rosemary was also an ingredient in “Four Thieves Vinegar,” a concoction that was infused with herbs and spices and used by grave robbers to protect themselves against the plague. A symbol of remembrance, Rosemary was also tossed into graves as a promise that loved ones who passed away would not be forgotten.\nIt was used throughout the civilizations in cosmetics for its antiseptic, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties and in medical care for its health benefits. Rosemary had even become a favorite alternative herbal medicine for the German-Swiss physician, philosopher, and botanist Paracelsus, who promoted its healing properties, including its ability to strengthen the body and to heal organs such as the brain, heart, and liver. Despite being unaware of the concept of germs, people of the 16th century used Rosemary as incense or as massage balms and oils to eliminate harmful bacteria, especially in the rooms of those suffering from illness. For thousands of years, folk medicine has also used Rosemary for its ability to improve memory, soothe digestive issues, and relieve aching muscles.\nRosemary Essential Oil’s chemical composition consists of the following main constituents: α -Pinene, Camphor, 1,8-Cineol, Camphene, Limonene, and Linalool.\nα -Pinene is known to exhibit the following activity:\n- Cough suppressant\n- Cough suppressant\n- Nervous system stimulant\n- Appetite suppressant\nUsed in aromatherapy, Rosemary Oil helps reduce stress levels and nervous tension, boost mental activity, encourage clarity and insight, relieve fatigue, and support respiratory function. It is used to improve alertness, eliminate negative moods, and increase the retention of information by enhancing concentration. The scent of Rosemary Essential Oil stimulates the appetite and is also known to reduce the level of harmful stress hormones that are released when involved intense experiences. Inhaling Rosemary Oil boosts the immune system by stimulating internal anti-oxidant activity, which in turn fights ailments caused by free radicals, and it relieves throat and nasal congestion by clearing the respiratory tract.\nDiluted and used topically, Rosemary Essential Oil is known to stimulate hair growth, reduce pain, soothe inflammation, eliminate headaches, strengthen the immune system, and condition hair to make it look and feel healthy. Used in a massage, Rosemary Oil’s detoxifying properties can facilitate healthy digestion, relieve flatulence, bloating and cramps, and relieve constipation. Through massage, this oil stimulates circulation, which allows the body to better absorb nutrients from food. In cosmetics for hair care, Rosemary Essential Oil’s tonic properties stimulate hair follicles to lengthen and strengthen hair while slowing the graying of hair, preventing hair loss, and moisturizing dry scalp to relieve dandruff. Traditionally, Rosemary Oil combined with Olive Oil in a hot oil hair treatment has been known to darken and strengthen hair. The anti-microbial, antiseptic, astringent, antioxidant, and tonic properties of this oil make it a beneficial additive in skin care products that are meant to soothe or even treat dry or oily skin, eczema, inflammation, and acne. Effective for all skin types, this rejuvenating oil can be added to soaps, face washes, face masks, toners, and creams to achieve firm yet hydrated skin that appears to have a healthy glow that is free of unwanted marks.\nRosemary Essential Oil’s refreshing and energizing aroma can be diluted with water and used in natural homemade room fresheners to eliminate unpleasant odors from the environment as well as from objects. When added to recipes for homemade scented candles, it can work the same way to freshen the scent of a room.\n- COSMETIC: Stimulant, Analgesic, Anti-inflammatory, Antiseptic, Anti-fungal, Anti-bacterial, Astringent, Disinfectant, Antioxidant.\n- ODOROUS: Anti-stress, Cognition-enhancement, Psycho-stimulant, Stimulant, Decongestant.\n- MEDICINAL: Anti-bacterial, Anti-fungal, Detoxifying, Analgesic, Anti-inflammatory, Carminative, Laxative, Decongestant, Antiseptic, Disinfectant, Antiseptic, Anti-nociceptive.\nCULTIVATING AND HARVESTING QUALITY ROSEMARY OIL\nRosemary is a perennial bush that often grows on the sea cliffs of Spain, France, Greece, and Italy. The leaves of the aromatic Rosemary bush have a high oil concentration, and it is part of an aromatic family of herbs, which also includes Lavender, Basil, Mint, and Oregano to name a few.\nRosemary is a hardy plant that can withstand frost, but it also loves the sun and thrives in dry climates where the temperature is between 20ᵒ-25ᵒ Celsius (68ᵒ-77ᵒ Fahrenheit) and does not drop below -17ᵒ Celsius (0ᵒ Fahrenheit). Though Rosemary can grow in a small pot inside a home, when grown outside, the Rosemary bush can reach a height of approximately 5 ft. Due to its adaptability to various ecological conditions, Rosemary plants can vary in appearance in terms of their colors, the sizes of their flowers, and the aromas of their essential oils. The Rosemary plant requires adequate water drainage, as it will not grow well if it is over-irrigated or in soils with a high clay content, thus it can grow in the earth that ranges in soil type from sandy to clay loam soil as long as it has a pH range of 5,5 to 8,0.\nThe upper side of Rosemary leaves are dark and the undersides are pale and covered in thick hairs. The tips of the leaves begin to sprout small, tubular pale- to deep-blue flowers, which continue to bloom in the summer. Rosemary Essential Oil of the most superior quality is obtained from the flowering tops of the plant, although oils can also be obtained from the stems and leaves before the plant begins to flower. Rosemary fields are usually harvested once or twice a year, depending on the geographical region of cultivation. Harvesting is most often done mechanically, which allows more frequent cutting due to higher yields from rapid regrowth.\nBefore distillation, the leaves are dried either naturally by the heat of the sun or by using driers. Drying the leaves in the sun results in poor quality leaves for producing oils. The ideal drying method involves the use of a forced air-flow drier, which results in better quality leaves. After the product is dried, the leaves are further processed to have the stems removed. They are sieved to remove dirt.\nHOW IS ROSEMARY OIL EXTRACTED?\nRosemary Essential Oil is most commonly extracted through the steam distillation of the plant’s flowering tops and leaves. After distillation, the oil has a watery viscosity and can be colorless or pale yellow. It’s powerful and refreshing smell is herbaceous and similar to mint with an undertone that is characterized as woody and balsamic.\nUSES OF ROSEMARY OIL\nThe uses of Rosemary Essential Oil are abundant, ranging from medicinal and odorous to cosmetic. Its many forms include oils, gels, lotions, soaps, shampoos, and sprays, to name a few suggestions for homemade products.\nUsed in aromatherapy, the woody, evergreen scent of Rosemary can promote relaxation and boost alertness as well as brain function, thereby improving memory. To relieve stress while studying and maintain concentration, diffuse Rosemary Essential Oil in the room for a maximum of 30 minutes.\nDiluted with a carrier oil and used topically, Rosemary Essential Oil’s detoxifying and anesthetic properties can boost immunity by recharging the body’s detoxification system. By diluting Rosemary Oil in a carrier oil such as Fractionated Coconut Oil and massaging it into the lymph nodes, the body will be stimulated to more rapidly eliminate waste and to soothe digestive ailments. Its analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties make it an ideal essential oil for relieving muscle aches and pains. For a massage oil that reduces pain, blend Rosemary Oil with Peppermint Oil and dilute the blend in Coconut Oil then rub on tender muscles and aching joints.\nRosemary Essential Oil’s anti-viral, anti-microbial, and antiseptic properties make it a natural homemade multi-purpose cleaning spray to cleanse indoor environments and eliminate harmful bacteria therein. A dilution of Rosemary Oil in distilled white vinegar and water make a spray cleaner that is suitable to wipe down surfaces like countertops.\nA GUIDE TO ROSEMARY OIL VARIETIES & THEIR BENEFITS\n|ROSEMARY VARIETY & BOTANICAL NAME||COUNTRY OF ORIGIN||BENEFITS OF OIL|\n|Rosemary (Morocco) Essential Oil\n|Rosemary Essential Oil (Spanish)\n|Rosemary Organic Essential Oil\nCONTRAINDICATIONS FOR ROSEMARY OIL\nAs per NAHA guidelines, we do not recommend the ingestion of essential oils. It is imperative to consult a medical practitioner before using Rosemary Essential Oil for therapeutic purposes. Pregnant and nursing women and those taking prescription drugs are especially advised not to use Rosemary Essential Oil without the medical advice of a physician. The oil may have a negative effect on the fetus and potentially lead to miscarriage. Rosemary Essential Oil should always be stored in an area that is inaccessible to children, especially those under the age of 7. Those with high blood pressure should avoid using this oil, as it may further elevate blood pressure.\nWhen applied topically, Rosemary Essential Oil should be used in dilution – a carrier oil such as Almond, Coconut, Jojoba, Olive, or Hemp is recommended – and in small amounts, as using the oil directly or in high concentrations can potentially cause skin irritation. A skin test is recommended prior to use. This can be done by diluting the essential oil in a carrier oil and applying a small amount to a small area of skin that is not sensitive.

71	how do banks profit from exchange rates	Market makers at banks make profit primarily by seeing two-way business. They collect the spread between bid and offer prices when they see enough flow at both sides of their quote, while netting off their exposure. Large banks can achieve significant profit simply by collecting this spread day after day from the huge flows of foreign currency transactions from their operations around the world. Additionally, dealers may choose to take positions in currencies at their discretion.	"[""How Do Forex Market Makers Work?\nReading time: 10 minutes\nThe Forex market, It is a 24-hour market between Sunday and Friday, and is closed on Saturdays (e.g. it opens at 5pm EST on a Sunday, and closes at 4PM on a Friday EST). The Forex market also has no single central location of operation. Trading Forex (FX) itself is a reasonably straightforward affair for any single participant, but the overall interaction between the various players adds up to a complex affair.\nYou see, the Forex market breaks down into a large number of players of varying sizes. This article is going to look at a key type of operator in the Forex market, the role of Forex Market Makers. They play a significant part in FX prices. To better understand how market makers fit into the overall picture, we need to take a quick look at the market as a whole.\nAt the top of the tree sits the interbank Forex market. The interbank Forex market comprises the transactions conducted between the major banks. One way of describing it is as the wholesale level at which currencies are exchanged. It is here where we can see the core role of the FX market maker.\nEach bank has dedicated market makers for each major currency pair. They provide prices at which the bank commits to buying and selling currencies from their peers in the interbank market. Though these prices are intended for the interbank market, they effectively permeate their way to the retail side of the market, as we shall discuss later. Therefore, we can say that the institutions that comprise the interbank market are the primary market makers in the FX market.\nSo what does a market maker do?\nThe name is largely self-explanatory. A market maker quotes two-way prices in a certain currency pair, thereby making a market. A Forex market maker essentially does three things:\n- Sets bid and offer prices within a certain currency pair\n- Commits to accepting deals at these prices within certain constraints\n- Takes the resulting exposure on to their own book (at least initially)\nWhat are the constraints mentioned in the second point above?\nBasically the quote may only be good in a certain minimum or maximum size, and the price will only be good if dealt with in a timely manner. The third point establishes that a market maker is a counterparty to a Forex trade. In other words, they are not matching the trade with another party, in the way that a broker would.\nIn terms of taking this exposure onto their book, a market maker may subsequently choose to hedge the exposure with another bank, if they are able to gain a favourable rate. How quickly or slowly, or how much risk they lay off will be at their own discretion.\nOne way a market maker makes profit is by seeing two-way business. If they see enough flow at both sides of their quote, they can simply collect the bid offer spread, while netting off their exposure. Now, the large banks see huge flows of foreign currency transactions from their operations around the world.\nBecause of this, they can achieve significant profit simply by collecting this spread day after day. Of course, a dealer may also choose to take a position in a currency at their discretion. They can do this by either making a trade with another bank, or by pricing accordingly, in order to attract trades in a certain direction.\nThe Forex Market Makers Method – How Do They Set Their Prices?\nBank dealers weigh up a number of concerns when making their prices.\n- The prevailing rates being quoted elsewhere\n- Their own exposure – what positions they already have on their book\n- Their view on the future performance of the currency pair\n- Volumes available at the prevailing market rate, and the volume of the deal they are quoting for\nRetail FX Pricing\nThe trades between the large banks form the core of the FX market by volume. There's more, though: the banks' continuous commitment to buy and sell currencies is a cornerstone of all pricing in the FX market. Despite the huge volumes that go through the interbank market, a large portion of Forex participants do not have direct access.\nWhy is that?\nOne of the foundations of the interbank market is the credit relationships that the largest banks have between each other. The banks buy and sell currencies between each other on this credit basis alone. Furthermore, deals in the interbank market are typically very large.\nThese aspects combine to preclude most players from directly accessing the interbank market. Indeed, there was a time when the FX market as a whole was only really the preserve of banks, institutions, and the very wealthy. That has all changed now of course.\nRetail clients now readily access the Forex market. They do this via FX and CFD brokers that directly or indirectly tap into prices made by the large banks. This trend has been aided by improvements in technology. Progress in these areas has led to a variety of excellent electronic trading platforms.\nOne of the most popular retail FX platforms is MetaTrader 4, and perhaps the most advanced plugin available for that platform is MetaTrader 4 Supreme Edition. MT4SE offers a host of useful features, including the professional-style 'Trade Terminal' that allows multi-currency trade management.\nSource: MetaTrader 4 - Market Watch & Trading Terminal\nWhat is the upshot of these platform advances?\nThe gap between the trading experience of institutional investors and that of retail clients has narrowed over the years. Retail clients now have access to very competitive Forex spreads, and trading has become extremely convenient.\nSo how do FX brokers offer prices to retail clients?\nTo answer this question, we need to be careful with our terminology. You see, some of these firms are sometimes referred to as market makers, but in fact, they do not really perform all of the core functions of a true market maker.\nThe way FX firms operate varies, but pricing tends to ultimately be derived from the same familiar players. Namely, the large banks who operate as prime brokers for these firms. Some firms may operate effectively as a broker, hedging off their exposure immediately with their liquidity provider.\nOthers may take some of the exposure onto their own book. But here's the key part: generally, they do not make their own prices as a true market maker would. For any particular currency, a retail FX firm might offer an aggregate price. This would essentially be the best bid/offer that they have access to via the market making counterparties that they hedge with.\nAn alternative way that firms grant their clients access to the FX market is via Electronic Communications Networks (or ECNs). An ECN aggregates bids and offers from banks, institutions, and other traders into an order book. If you place a trade, the ECN will match you against the very best price available. ECNs are typically extremely fast and offer transparent systems with very tight spreads.\nPros and Cons of Market Makers Forex Prices\nSome people dislike the notion of a market maker, taking the view that they are somehow calling the market against them. Obviously, a market maker is not going to quote a price that doesn't suit their own position, but they ultimately quote a two-way price. This means that there is an extremely limited amount that the price can be skewed before an arbitrage opportunity opens.\nThe overarching European Markets and Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) requires UK FX firms to be committed to offering the best execution on their clients' behalf. Before this standard came into play, some firms might have tweaked their price in order reflect their book position, but this cannot happen under best execution.\nWhen discussing market makers, the bottom line is that they are the pillar that the FX market is built upon. Beyond this fundamental contribution of effectively enabling the FX market to function, they do offer some other benefits as well. They offer consistency and liquidity to the market, with their continuous commitment to take the opposite side of any deal.\nA market maker Forex price is at its roots, made by a human: someone somewhere is literally deciding the bid/offer price. Nearly all technical indicators rely on a belief that price action is guided by human behaviour, as opposed to being a random walk.\nThat there is such a large human element in the prime making of prices would tend to lend credibility to the efficacy of technical indicators. The human element also means that there is less volatility in comparison to ECN prices. ECNs allow automated trading systems to plug directly in, and trade at near instantaneous speeds.\nThis can lead to rates fluctuating at such rapid rates that it makes it less easy to use. We should also note that ECNs are very suited to high frequency trading strategies and scalpers. Market makers provide prices in good faith, as a basic component of the effective functioning of the market.\nThere are market makers in the stock market, as well as the FX market, and both help to provide liquidity. So how do these different types of market makers compare? Well, a key way in which the FX market differs from the stock market is that Forex transactions are less transparent. Stocks trade on exchanges where trade information is made publicly available.\nThis means that the price and volume data are readily available for stock trades on a real time basis. This is not the case for the Forex market however. Flows of FX business seen by the large banks is considered proprietary information, and there is no requirement for this information to be disclosed.\nMarket makers at the major banks are aware of large, and therefore potentially market-moving trades, before the wider market. This, in theory, gives them an advantage over other traders. The kind of information to which a market maker may be privy, but is unavailable to the market as a whole may include:\n- Institutions rebalancing portfolios\n- Hedging requirements\n- Changes in risk appetite.\nSuch flows may influence the short-term trend of FX prices. Some view this as providing an unfair advantage to market makers. A market maker would argue this aid to their trading strategy is a benefit that stems from the service they provide.\nChoosing an Appropriate Forex Market Maker Strategy\nWhether you prefer the consistency of pricing from a market maker, or the variable spreads of an ECN is up to you You may find that your strategy or style of trading dictates what you use. If you are a scalper or an algo-trader, you may find that ECN pricing suits you better, for example. One way to access real live market prices is with Admiral Markets' demo trading account. This offers the benefit of allowing you to trade without taking on any risk.\nThis material does not contain and should not be construed as containing investment advice, investment recommendations, an offer of or solicitation for any transactions in financial instruments.

72	What are the different types of peated whisky flavors?	Peated whisky offers a wide range of flavors that vary by region and peating level. These include soapy, sulphuric, medicinal, rich, smoky, herbal, creamy, saline, nutty, citrus and mossy notes. Some peated whiskies can taste like bonfire, burning tyres, diesel or bacon. The flavor intensity depends on the PPM (phenol Parts Per Million) level - for example, Ardbeg has 54ppm while Bunnahabhain has just 1-2ppm. The Society classifies peated whiskies into three profiles: Lightly peated (with toasted marshmallow and garden bonfire notes), Peated (with rich meats and herbal flavors), and Heavily peated (with strong smoky flavors like cigar butts and smoked meats).	"[""Whisky is a versatile, complex spirit that can deliver a range of flavours evoking different responses from member to member. Our Tasting Panel has developed 12 unique flavour profiles to help group whiskies into easily identifiable categories. Think of them as locations on a flavour map, and prepare to take a journey through our ever-changing selection of single cask, single malt whiskies.\nYoung & spritely\nOur Young & spritely flavour profile challenges established age conventions and reflects the whisky's character rather than its age statement. Typically, the bottlings from this flavour profile come from within the 7 to 14-year-old age bracket and exude characteristics of younger whiskies, with flavours such as sour apple candies, rhubarb, gummi bears, tinned mandarins and plum tarts.\nSweet, fruity & mellow\nOur Sweet, fruity & mellow flavour profile is a culinary delight, with watermelon, Pimms, apple pie, or even lime marmalade. The profile focuses on the best in sweet whisky, evoking thoughts of sherbet and other treats. The mellow flavours and strength make this a popular profile for beginners and experienced enthusiasts alike.\nSweet & spicy\nExpressions within the Sweet & spicy flavour profile can vary, but common flavour experiences can include gingerbread, hot cross buns, mulled wine and even balsamic strawberries. Think about the culinary experience of bringing spice into sweet dishes, the addition of cinnamon to pastries or sweet chili flavours from East Asia.\nSpicy & dry\nThe Spicy & dry flavour profile contains expressions from all over Scotland. The iconic flavour experiences captured in the profile evoke memories of cooking with nutmeg, cloves and peppercorns. On the nose this profile delivers rich experiences and includes whiskies with strong aromas of sandalwood, pencil shavings and even tree bark.\nDeep, rich & dried fruits\nThe Deep, rich & dried fruits profile offers a wonderful selection of aromas and flavours. Our Tasting Notes describe fruity whisky profiles on the nose such as marmalade, honeycomb toffee, balsamic glazed fruits and demerara. If you discover flavours of rum truffles, molasses and salted caramel, you're probably not far off for this profile.\nOld & dignified\nOur Old & dignified flavour profile exudes the characteristics that can only come from long, careful maturation and older, well-balanced age statements. The Tasting Notes typically refer to rich flavours with clear aromas, such as honeycomb, brandy snaps, polished wood, and dark chocolate orange to excite the palate and make this flavour profile a must-try.\nLight & delicate\nThe Light & delicate flavour profile is one to confound your expectations, as it may not reflect a whisky's age. The light whisky focuses more on subtle and delicate flavour experiences emerging from the drams, with softer flavours such as fresh laundry, peach, flower meadows and green tea.\nJuicy, oak & vanilla\nA complex flavour profile, Juicy, oak & vanilla offers an interesting assortment of flavour experiences. Our exacting Tasting Panel describes clear aromas of honeysuckle, coriander seed and even dunnage warehouses. Flavours in this profile often include exciting, juicy fruits and a deeper wood flavour. Think chocolate-coated cherries, passion fruit or pineapple sorbet, and toasted oak.\nOily & coastal\nOur Oily & coastal flavour profile certainly contains coastal whiskies, but it isn't limited to them. That's because the Society challenges traditional whisky convention to focus on flavour as the main guide. The flavours in this category remind us of coastal settings and the foods and experiences available there, with oysters, barbecued prawns, seaweed, driftwood and beach bonfires.\nThe Lightly peated flavour profile is the first of three covering the sought-after Peated category. Lightly peated whiskies in this collection evoke intriguing flavours and aromas, from toasted marshmallows to smoky garden bonfires and wood ash. This profile makes an excellent first step into peated whiskies for those exploring whisky flavours and is a great offering for more seasoned peated whisky fans.\nThe Peated flavour profile sits between lightly and heavily peated whiskies, offering a clear sense of peat for peated whisky enthusiasts and an intriguing step into the world of peated whisky for explorers new to the category. The profile has robust perfumed aromas on the nose, while the flavour delivers rich meats and roasted foods. Expressions can deliver herbal flavours and aromas that give this category a wide range of flavour experiences from lavender smoke to hospitals and a ship's engine room.\nHeavily peated whisky comes with the territory of strong smoky flavours and earthy tones. Smoky whisky fans will love the rich aromas of cigar butts and wood burning stoves. On the palate, heavily peated whiskies often deliver smoked fish or meats. The flavour combinations and intricate aromas make this a compelling and powerful category to explore."", ""But first things first:\nWhat is Peat?Rubbish, really. Peat is thousands of years’ worth of decaying vegetation, animals and moss which have evolved into layers; a bog if you will. Peat’s substance varies; some bogs are more woody, whilst other peat is more watery. A peat bog grows by 1mm every year, so just a metre thick bog is 1000 years old.\nWhen peat is harvested, it’s cut up into small sloppy slices of ‘sod’, stacked in pyramids and left to dry. Before you know it, well, 2-3 weeks later, you have yourself some tough peat bricks, which contain more energy than coal. Peat fires are an ancient Scottish tradition; the stuff is so compact that it burns piping hot for ages.\nHow is peat used in making Whisky?Lots of people think that it's the water, which runs though peat bogs, which gives Whisky its peated taste. These people are talking codswallop. The substance is in the smoke.\nBarley grain, or damp malt, is exposed to the smoke of a peat fire in order to arrest germination; a crucial part of Whisky production. Peat smoke produces chemicals called phenols and these are absorbed by malted barley. The amount of time the barley grain’s exposed to the peat smoke determines the level of phenols, and therefore the spirit’s flavour. For an idea, damp malt is usually dried for about 30 hours. Laphroaig dries its malt over peat fire for between 12 to 18 of these 30 hours.\nHow is peat in Whisky measured?Once dried, the malt is mashed and the “peatiness” is measured by PPM, or phenol Parts Per Million. Some phenol is lost in distillation so the final PPM of the spirit is roughly one third of the original figure. Distilleries still use the PPM of the malt. For example Ardbeg clocks in at around 54ppm, Bowmore 22ppm and Bunnahabhain is a mere 1 - 2ppm.\nWhat does peat taste like?Peat varies by region, and can add tasting notes including anything from soapy, sulphuric, medicinal, rich, smoky, herbal, creamy, saline, nutty, citrus and mossy to like a bonfire, burning tyres, diesel or even bacon depending on the amount of time the malt is peated for, the PPM and the length of time left to mature.\nPeat is not for everyone, granted. But when you want to try a peated dram, look for these\nPeated Whisky brandsThe peat flavour in varying degrees is considered essential in Scotch Whisky, particularly those produced in Islay, such as Laphroaig, Lagavulin and Ardbeg, Bowmore, Port Charlotte and Caol Ila.\nIn other parts of Scotland, peated Whiskies can be found as well: Springbank, Benromach, Ardmore, Highland Park, Talisker, Leadig and Longrow, to name just a few with peaty expressions in their portfolios.\nLooking for peated Whisky outside Scotland, India’s Peated Amrut is an emerging classic, Japan is also big on the peat, particularly at the Yoichi distillery, Swiss Saentis is an absolute hit, whilst in New Zealand the Manuka Smoke single malt has recently been introduced.\nLike your Irish? Try the very peated Connemara Peated Single Malt, a lovely liquid.\nIf you like your curry extra spicy and your espresso double, you might want to go all in on the peat and are starting to wonder right now:\nWhat is the most peated Whisky in the world?There’s no official peated Whisky ranking, but there's no doubt that the most peated Whisky in the world is Bruichladdich’s Octomore 08.3 Masterclass. At a whopping 309.1PPM, our fellow peat-eaters!\nGo ahead, be our guest, just beware; this Whisky was born from a dare and your first sip of it will feel like you are actually biting into a clump of peat. No doubt future releases of the Octomore will look to build on this extreme peating, but only time will tell when they reach the upper limit.\nSo what do you say – peated Whisky yea or nay?""]"	['<urn:uuid:c3c6bb70-7da6-46dc-8a10-fadd48c8ef49>', '<urn:uuid:08ce6fb1-5c3a-43dd-86c3-3b8d7deb68cf>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	9	102	1422
73	architecture expert curious about norman palace palermo kings sicily medieval islamic elements	The Palazzo dei Normanni (Royal Palace of Palermo) was established as the main residence of Sicilian kings during the Norman domination. The original structure, known as Qasr, was built in the 9th century by the Emir of Palermo, with Arabian elements still visible in the foundations and basements, including typical Arabian vaults. After conquering Sicily in 1072, the Norman kings transformed the Arabian palace into a complex serving both administrative and residential purposes. The buildings were connected by arcades and surrounded by gardens designed by middle eastern gardeners. In 1132, King Roger II enhanced the palace by adding the Cappella Palatina.	"['Palermo is a city in Insular Italy, the capital of both the autonomous region of Sicily and the Province of Palermo. The city is noted for its history, culture, architecture and gastronomy, playing an important role throughout much of its existence; it is over 2,700 years old. Palermo is located in the northwest of the island of Sicily, right by the Gulf of Palermo in the Tyrrhenian Sea.\nThe city was founded by the Phoenicians, but named by the Ancient Greeks asPanormus meaning \'always fit for landing in.\' Palermo became part of the Roman Republic, the Roman Empire and eventually part of the Byzantine Empire, for over a thousand years. From 827 to 1071 it was under Arab rule during the Emirate of Sicily when it first became a capital. Following the Norman reconquest, Palermo became capital of a new kingdom (from 1130 to 1816), the Kingdom of Sicily. Eventually it would be united with the Kingdom of Naples to form the Two Sicilies until the Italian unification of 1860.\n|Remains of the old city walls|\n|The Palazzo dei Normanni|\nFrom 1820 to 1848 all Sicily was shaken by upheavals, which culminated on January 12, 1848, with a popular insurrection, the first one in Europe that year, led by Giuseppe La Masa. A parliament and constitution were proclaimed. The first president was Ruggero Settimo. The Bourbons soon reconquered Palermo (May 1849), which remained under their rule until the appearance of Giuseppe Garibaldi. This famous general entered Palermo with his troops (the “Thousands”) on May 27, 1860. After the plebiscite later that year Palermo and the whole of Sicily became part of the new Kingdom of Italy (1861).\nIn 1946 the city was declared the seat of the Regional Parliament, as capital of a Special Status Region (1947) whose seat is in the Palazzo dei Normanni. Palermo\'s future seemed to look bright again. Many opportunities were lost in the coming decades, owing to incompetence, incapacity, corruption and abuse of power.\nThe main topic of the modern age is the struggle against the Mafia and bandits like Salvatore Giuliano, who controlled the neighbouring area of Montelepre. The Italian State had to share effective control of the territory, economic as well as administrative, with the Mafia families.\nThe so-called ""Sack of Palermo"" is one of the major visible faces of this problem. The term is used today to indicate the heavy building speculations that filled the city with poor buildings. The reduced importance of agriculture in the Sicilian economy had led to a massive migration to the cities, especially Palermo, which swelled in size. Instead of rebuilding the city centre the town was thrown into a frantic expansion towards the north, where practically a new town was built. The regulatory plan for the expansion was largely ignored. New parts of town appeared almost out of nowhere, but without parks, schools, public buildings, proper roads and the other amenities that characterise a modern city. The Mafia played a huge role in this process, which was an important element in the Mafia\'s transition from a mostly rural phenomenon into a modern criminal organisation. The Mafia took advantage of corrupt city officials (a former mayor of Palermo, Vito Ciancimino, has been condemned for his bribery with Mafiosi) and protection coming from the Italian central government itself.\nToday, Palermo is a city still struggling to recover from the devastation of uncontrolled urban growth. The historic city centre is still partly in ruins, the traffic is horrific, and poverty is widespread. Being the city in which the Italian Mafia historically had its main interests, it has also been the place of several recent well-publicized murders.\nPalermo is connected to the mainland by an international airport and an increasing number of maritime links. However, land connections remain poor. This and other reasons have until now thwarted the development of tourism. This has been identified as the main resource to exploit for the city\'s recovery, the legacy of three millennia of history and folklore.\nCaponata, a tasty salad made with eggplant (aubergines), olives, capers and celery, makes a great appetizer. There is also an artichoke-based version of this traditional dish, though you\'re less likely to find it in most restaurants. Sfincione is a local form of pizza made with tomatoes, onions and (sometimes) anchovies. Prepared on a thick bread and more likely found in a bakery than in a pizzeria, sfincione is good as a snack or appetizer. Panella is a thin paste made of crushed or powdered ceci (garbanzo) beans and served fried. Maccu is a creamy soup made from the same bean. Crocché(croquet) are fried potato dumplings made with cheese, parsley and eggs. Arancine are fried rice balls stuffed with meat or cheese.\nSicily is renowned for its seafood. Grilled swordfish is popular. Smaller fish, especially snapper, is sometimes prepared in a vinegar and sugar sauce. Seppia (cuttlefish) is served in its own black sauce with pasta. Another Sicilian seafood dish made with pasta is finnochio con sarde (fennel with sardines). Meat dishes are always popular. Many are traditionally made with lamb or goat. Best known outside Sicily is vitello alla marsala (veal marsala), one of many regional meat specialties. Chicken ""alla marsala"" can be prepared using a similar recipe and method. Milza (veal spleen) sandwiches are a bit ""native"" for most tastes, and loaded with cholesterol, but delicious anyway.\nSicilian desserts are superlative. Cannoli are tubular crusts with creamy ricotta and sugar filling. If they taste a little different from the ones you\'ve had outside Italy, that\'s because the ricotta here is made from sheep\'s milk. Cassata is a rich, sugary cake filled with the same delicious filling. Frutta di Martorana (or pasta reale) are almond marzipan pastries colored and shaped to resemble real fruit. Sicilian gelato (ice cream) is excellent. In fact, it is possible that ice cream was invented in Sicily during Roman times, when a relay of runners would bring snow down from Mount Etna to be flavored and served to wealthy patricians. You\'ll find flavors ranging from pistachio and hazelnut (nocciola) to jasmine (gelsomino) to mulberry (gelsi) to strawberry (fragala) and rum (zuppa inglese). Granita is sweetened crushed ice made in Summer and flavored with lemons or strawberries.\n- The Cathedral of Palermo is an architectural complex It is characterized by the presence of different styles, due to a long history of additions, alterations and restorations, the last of which occurred in the 18th century. The church was erected in 1185 by Walter Ophamil (or Walter of the Mill), the Anglo-Norman archbishop of Palermo and King William II\'s minister, on the area of an earlier Byzantine basilica. By all accounts this earlier church was founded by St. Gregory and was later turned into a mosque by the Saracens after their conquest of the city in the 9th century. Ophamil is buried in a sarcophagus in the church\'s crypt. The medieval edifice had a basilica plan with three apses, of which only some minor architectural elements survive today. The upper orders of the corner towers were built between the 14th and the 15th centuries, while in the early Renaissance period the southern porch was added. The present neoclassical appearance dates from the work carried out over the two decades 1781 to 1801, and supervised by Ferdinando Fuga. During this period the great retable by Gagini, decorated with statues, friezes and reliefs, was destroyed and the sculptures moved to different parts of the basilica. Also by Fuga are the great dome emerging from the main body of the building, and the smaller domes covering the aisles\' ceilings.\n- The Palazzo dei Normanni or Royal Palace of Palermo was the seat of the Kings of Sicily during the Norman domination and served afterwards as the main seat of power for the subsequent rulers of Sicily. Today it is the seat of the regional parliament of Sicily. The palace stands in what is the highest point of the ancient centre of the city, just above the first Punic settlements, whose remains can still be found in the basement. The first building, the Qasr (in Arabic, castle or palace) is believed to have been started in the 9th century by the Emir of Palermo. Parts of this early building are still visible in the foundations and in the basements, where typical Arabian vaults are present. After the Normans conquered Sicily in 1072 (just 6 years after they conquered England) and established Palermo as the capital of the new Kingdom of Sicily, the palace was chosen as the main residence of the kings. The Norman kings transformed the former Arabian palace into a multifunctional complex with both administrative and residential aims. All the buildings were linked to each other via arcades and enclosed by gardens, designed by the best gardeners of the middle east. In 1132 King Roger II added the famous Cappella Palatina to the complex, making it the focus of the palace.\n- Palermo City Walls. Palermo has got at least 2 circuits of City Walls - many pieces of which still survive. The first circuit surrounded the ancient core of the punic City - the so-called Palaeopolis (in the area east of Porta Nuovo) and the Neopolis. Via Vittorio Emanuele was the main road E-W through this early walled City. The eastern edge of the walled City was on Via Roma and the ancient port in the vicinity of Piazza Marina. The wall circuit was approximately Porto Nuovo, Corso Alberti, Piazza Peranni, Via Isodoro, Via Candela, Via Venezia, Via Roma, Piazza Paninni, Via Biscottari, Via Del Bastione, Palazzo dei Normanni and back to Porto Nuovo. In the medieval period the wall circuit was expanded. Via Vittorio Emanuele continued to be the main road E-W through the walled City. West gate was still Porto Nuovo, the circuit continued to Corso Alberti, to Piazza Vittorio em Orlando where it turned east along Via Volturno to Piazza Verdi and along the line of Via Cavour. At this North East corner there was a defense, Castello a Mare, to protect the port at La Cala. A huge chain was used to block La Cala with the other end at S Maria della Catena (St Mary of the Chain). The sea-side wall was along the western side of Foro Italico Umberto. The wall turns west along the northern side of Via Abramo Lincoln, continues along Corso Tukory. The wall turns north approximately on Via Benedetto, to Palazzo dei Normanni and back to Porto Nuovo. Source: Palermo - City Guide by Adriana Chirco, 1998, Dario Flaccovio Editore.\nSeveral gates in the City Wall survive.\n- The Teatro Massimo Vittorio Emanuele is an opera house and opera company. It was dedicated to King Victor Emanuel II. It is the biggest in Italy, and one of the largest of Europe (the third after the Opéra National de Paris and the K. K. Hof-Opernhaus in Vienna), renowned for its perfect acoustics. The opera house was designed and overseen by the very genial Italian architect Giovan Battista Filippo Basile and, following his death in 1891, construction was then overseen by his highly artistic son, Architect Ernesto Basile. G. B. Filippo Basile was well known in Sicily also for his previous cathedral restoration design in the city of Acireale, as well as garden and villa designs in the city of Palermo and Caltagirone.\n- Catacombe dei Cappuccini, the catacombs of the Capuchin convent located on the Piazza Cappuccini, just west of the city centre, contain over 8000 mummified ex-residents from Palermo and its surrounding villages, some merely clothed skeletons, other remarkably well-preserved and lifelike. Well worth a visit, interesting, if slightly morbid. Children may either find it exciting or terrifying and it must be the responsibility of their parents to think carefully before taking them.']"	['<urn:uuid:76b6e60d-1581-45c6-b9e3-43ac73a31a80>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	12	101	1958

Voice sounds are normally produced by vocal folds/cords, which are tissue folds in the larynx (voicebox) that vibrate against each other. After a stroke or brain injury, people can develop voice disorders (dysphonia) where the voice becomes hoarse, strained, raspy or weak. They may also develop aphasia, affecting their ability to form sentences or remember words.

Although the causes of these disorders are often not clear, the main known risk factors include hearing problems, general developmental problems and disorders affecting the development of the brain.\nLanguage disorders in adults are almost always the result of brain injury or disease. People who have had a stroke, for example, often have trouble forming sentences or remembering words. That type of disorder is called aphasia.\nPeople with speech disorders have difficulty producing the sounds of speech, saying words clearly or talking fluently.\nChildren often have trouble with pronunciation, and may have a lisp or swap certain sounds for others. Speech disorders may be the result of developmental disorders, but psychological factors might also play a role. Adults with neurological diseases sometimes have speech disorders too, often making it hard to understand them.\nAnother group of speech disorders, known as fluency disorders, involve problems with the flow or evenness of speech. People with this sort of disorder may stutter or “clutter,” for example. When people stutter, there are often silent pauses in their speech, or they repeat or lengthen certain sounds or syllables. Cluttering is abnormally fast speech that makes the pronunciation imprecise or leaves out sounds or parts of words.\nVoice disorders (dysphonia)\nA voice disorder is a persistent change in someone’s voice. They might sound hoarse, strained, raspy or nearly silent. Often the voice is somewhat weak – in other words, it cracks easily or the person is not able to speak loudly. Voice disorders may arise from speaking too much or too loudly, from using the wrong breathing technique, or from problems with the voice box (larynx) like vocal nodules. Psychological causes like depression or a reaction to a distressing event can change a person’s voice too.\nIn people with swallowing problems, the movements of the muscles involved in swallowing are affected. This leads to problems transporting food through the mouth and throat. The cause is often a disease or disorder of the nervous system, such as Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, dementia, an like Lyme disease or tetanus, or a head injury. If food gets into the lungs because of a swallowing disorder, it can lead to life-threatening complications.\nWhat treatments are used in speech therapy?\nThere are various speech therapy techniques for each of the areas described above – the ones that are considered depend on the particular disorder. A long series of treatment sessions is typically needed, with each lasting 30 to 60 minutes. They may take place in a group or one-on-one.\nThe treatment approaches used in speech therapy include:\n- Perception exercises, for example to differentiate between individual sounds and syllables\n- Exercises to produce certain sounds and improve the fluency of speech\n- Exercises to improve breathing, swallowing and the voice\n- Help with communication using things like sign language, communication boards and computer-assisted speech\n- Advice for people who need speech therapy, their parents and other loved ones\n- Support in implementing these measures in everyday life\nFor the treatment to help over the long term, it’s often important to also regularly practice the techniques at home.']"	['<urn:uuid:2420d7f0-0ea8-4364-9b11-2189fcd6d4ce>', '<urn:uuid:2a1cea81-a4a6-46f7-a37c-198378c63d58>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	36	56	1123
75	When substituting pyrophyllite for feldspar in ceramic bodies, what changes occur in terms of maturity, shrinkage, and strength, and how might this impact glaze fit?	When substituting pyrophyllite for feldspar, it decreases body maturity, firing shrinkage, and thermal expansion. The strength may increase even though the body becomes less vitreous. However, when considering glaze fit, it's often better to maintain a silica content of 20-25% since silica increases thermal expansion and improves glaze fit. If pyrophyllite is used, glazes may need to be adjusted to prevent crazing.	['|Monthly Tech-Tip |\nAlternate Names: Pyrophillite\nPyrophyllite is a low expansion mineral. The individual particles expand less on heating (and therefore contract less on cooling) than other refractory particles (like silica). Thus, during firing, pyrophyllite particles counter the shrinkage of the plastic components surrounding them (assuming that particles remain whole and undissolved to exert their influence on the surrounding matrix). Pyrophyllite-refractory clay combinations potentially have excellent volume stability and resistance to deformation at high temperatures. Pyrophyllite has a second expansion-lowering mechanism: Its presence in stoneware and porcelain bodies encourages the development of more mullite, this both increases firing strength and reduces thermal expansion. In this case, the individual particles of pyrophyllite react and transform from their original state.\nIn clay bodies, substitution of part or all of the silica will decrease thermal expansion (see also kyanite, mullite) while maintaining the level of maturity (although some adjustment in the feldspar will likely be needed). However, this will of course mean that glazes may need to be adjusted (or they will craze). Often times, glaze fit takes priority, and it is actually better to leave the silica content at 20-25% (silica increases thermal expansion and improves glaze fit).\nIn glazes Pyrophyllite is a better source of SiO2 than quartz (if its iron content can be tolerated). This is because the latter is slow to dissolve into the melt, often much is left undissolved (affecting the transparency). Also, since the SiO2 become an integral part of the glass, its theoretical expansion-lowering effect is more fully realized.\nWhen substituted for feldspar, pyrophyllite will decrease body maturity, firing shrinkage and thermal expansion. Strength may also be increased (even though the body is less vitreous).\nIn electrical porcelain, large amounts (up to 95%) may be used in bodies for optimal electrical properties and high frequency characteristics (where zero porosity is not critical).\nPyrophyllite is also used as an ingredient in wall tile bodies since it has the effect of reducing moisture expansion.\nBecause of its stable nature and physical properties, pyrophyllite is employed in mold release and parting agents in foundry and structural clay products.\nPyrophyllite is ideal for certain types of refractories because no calcining is needed. Its physical nature also helps to reduce wear and tear on molds and machinery that handle wet and dry product.\nSome grades of pyrophyllite have a higher iron content and can darken the color of porcelain bodies. For sanitary ware bodies where the translucency and fired color are not important pyrophyllite can be added to reduce pyroplastic deformation (especially where talc is employed as an auxiliary flux).\nAlso, porcelains that are highly vitreous can take pyrophyllite particles into solution, when this happens the effect of their low expansion properties is lost on the body.\nPyrax (Pyrophillite) is a mineral having a very low thermal expansion. It stands to reason that if we can maximize its percentage in a body and not fire the body to a point that changes the crystal structure, it will be resistant to thermal-shock-resistant cracking. To that end I mixed it with only kaolin (ball clay would add some quartz that would increase thermal expansion) and made slip-cast pieces. I fired them to cone 2 (after finding that by cone 4 shock-resistant properties begin to decline). As you can see from the video, the addition of grog actually harms the performance! The higher the Pyrax, the better. Will this work for kiln shelves? Yes!\nPyrophyllite at Wikipedia\nMaterials that melt at high temperatures. These are normally used for kiln bricks, furniture, etc. or for ceramics that must withstand high temperatures during service.\nLow Expansion Material\nMaterials used to make bodies requiring low expansion (e.g. flameware, refractories). The individual particles of these materials have low expansion. Some of theme even expand at certain temperature ranges.\nMaterials not classifiable as commonly known aluminum silicates. For example, kaolin is a common aluminum silicate.\nGeneric materials are those with no brand name. Normally they are theoretical, the chemistry portrays what a specimen would be if it had no contamination.

76	what scientific discoveries challenged traditional behaviorist beliefs about animal conditioning	By 1970, several findings challenged behaviorist beliefs. John Garcia showed that rats could not associate visual and auditory cues with food that made them ill, though they could associate olfactory cues. Quail could only associate visual cues (colors) with dangerous foods. Pigeons could associate sounds but not colors with danger, and colors but not sounds with food. This contradicted the behaviorist belief that any perceptible cue could be taught as a conditioned stimulus. Similarly in operant conditioning, rats could learn to press a bar for food but not to avoid shock, while they could learn to jump to avoid shock but not for food. Pigeons could learn to peck for food but had difficulty learning to hop on a treadle for food.	"['""Learning is often thought of as the alternative to instinct, which is the information passed genetically from one generation to the next. Most of us think the ability to learn is the hallmark of intelligence. The difference between learning and instinct is said to distinguish human beings from ""lower"" animals such as insects. Introspection, that deceptively convincing authority, leads one to conclude that learning, unlike instinct, usually involves conscious decisions concerning when and what to learn.\n""Work done in the past few decades has shown that such a sharp distinction between instinct and learningand between the guiding forces underlying human and animal behaviorcannot be made. For example, it has been found that many insects are prodigious learners. Conversely, we now know that the process of learning in higher animals, as well as in insects, is often innately guided, that is, guided by information inherent in the genetic makeup of the animal. In other words, the process of learning itself is often controlled by instinct.\n""It now seems that many, if not most, animals are ""preprogrammed"" to learn particular things and to learn them in particular ways. In evolutionary terms innately guided learning makes sense: very often it is easy to specify in advance the general characteristics of the things an animal should be able to learn, even when the details cannot be specified. For example, bees should be inherently suited to learning the shapes of various flowers, but it would be impossible to equip each bee at birth with a field guide to all the flowers it might visit.\n""Innately guided learninglearning by instinctis found at all levels of mental complexity in the animal kingdom. There is strong evidence, for example, that the process of learning human speech is largely guided by innate abilities and tendencies.\n""The distinction often made between learning and instinct is exemplified by two theoretical approaches to the study of behavior; ethology and behaviorist psychology. Ethology is usually thought of as the study of instinct.\n""Classical behaviorist psychologists see the world quite differently from ethologists. Behaviorists are primarily interested in the study of learning under strictly controlled conditions and have traditionally treated instinct as irrelevant to learning. Behaviorists believe nearly all the responses of higher animals can be divided into two kinds of learning called classical conditioning and operant conditioning.\n""Classical conditioning was discovered in dogs by the Russian physiologist Ivan P. Pavlov. In his classic experiment he showed that if a bell is rung consistently just before food is offered to a dog, eventually the dog will learn to salivate at the sound of the bell. The important factors in classical conditioning are the unconditioned stimulus (the innately recognized cue, which in this case is food), the unconditioned response (the innately triggered behavioral act, which in this case is salivation) and the conditioned stimulus (the stimulus the animal is conditioned to respond to, which in this case is the bell. Early behaviorists believed any stimulus an animal was physically capable of sensing could be linked, as a conditioned stimulus, to any unconditioned response.\n""In operant conditioning, the other major category of learning recognized by most behaviorists, animals learn a behavior pattern as the result of trial-and-error experimentation they undertake in order to obtain a reward or avoid a punishment. In the classic example a rat is trained to press a lever to obtain food. The experimenter shapes the behavior by rewarding the rat at first for even partial performance of the desired response. For example, at the outset the rat might be rewarded simply for facing the end of the cage in which the lever sits. Later the experimenter requires increasingly precise bahavior, until the response is perfected. Early behaviorists thought any behavior an animal was physically capable of performing could be taught, by means of operant conditioning, as a response to any cue or situation.\n""By 1970 several disturbing challenges to the behavioristic world view had appeared. The idea that any perceptible cue could be taught, by classical conditioning, as a conditioned stimulus was dealt a severe blow by John Garcia, now at the University of California at Los Angeles. He showed that rats could not associate visual and auditory cues with food that made them ill, even though they could associate olfactory cues with such food. On the other hand, he found that quail could associate not auditory or olfactory cues but visual onescolorswith dangerous foods. Later work by other investigators extended these results, showing, for example, that pigeons readily learn to associate sounds but not colors with danger and colors but not sounds with food. The obvious conclusion was that these animals are predisposed to make certain associations more easily in some situations than in others.\n""The same kind of pattern was discovered in experiments in operant conditioning. Rats readily learn to press a bar for food, but they cannot learn to press a bar in order to avoid an electric shock. Conversely, they can learn to jump in order to avoid a shock but not in order to obtain food. Similarly, pigeons easily learn to peck at a spot for a food reward but have great difficulty learning to hop on a treadle for food; they learn to avoid shock by hopping on a treadle but not by pecking. Once again it seems that in certain behavioral situations animals are innately prepared to learn some things more readily than others.\n""The associations that are most easily learned have an adaptive logic. In the natural world odor is a more reliable indicator than color for rats (which are notoriously nocturnal) trying to identify dangerous food; the color of a seed is a more useful thing for a pigeon to remember than any sounds the seed makes. Similarly, a pigeon is more likely to learn how to eat novel seeds if it experiments on food with its beak rather than with its feet. Animals that have innate biases concerning which cues they rely on and which procedures they attempt are more likely to ignore spurious cues, and they will learn faster than animals without inherent biases. The idea that animals are innately programed to attend to specific cues in specific behavioral contexts and to experiment in particular ways in other contexts suggest a mutually reinforcing relation between learning and instinct. This relation helps to reconcile the approaches of behaviorists and ethologists.""']"	['<urn:uuid:5aec54f5-a740-475b-9417-89457d073fd8>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	10	122	1058
77	How do movies and woodblock prints handle mass production?	Both are designed for reproducibility, but through different means. Films are produced through technological reproduction using camera apparatus, while woodblock prints achieved mass production through manual reproduction where designs were carved into wood blocks and manually pressed onto paper.	['(The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility and Other Writings on Media, by Walter Benjamin)\nI. THE PRODUCTION, REPRODUCTION, AND RECEPTION OF THE WORK OF ART\n- ” [Riegl] Man is, however, not solely a being who takes in impressions through the senses — he is not only passive — but also a desiring — that is, active — being, who will interpret the world as it reveals itself to his desire (which changes according to race, place, and time).” Works of art — or rather details within the work of art — are thus the clearest source of a very particular kind of historical information. They encode not just the character of the artistic production of the age, but the character of parallel features of the society: its religion, philosophy, ethical structure, and institutions.\n1. The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility\n- … … whereas the authentic work retains its full authority in the face of a reproduction made by hand, which it generally brands a forgery, this is not the case with technological reproduction … … First, technological reproduction is more independent of the original than is manual reproduction … … Second, technological reproduction can place the copy of the original in situations which the original itself cannot attain. Above all, it enables the original to meet the recipient halfway … … The cathedral leaves its site to be received in the studio of an art lover; the choral work performed in an auditorium or in the open air is enjoyed in a private room.\n- … … for the first time in world history, technological reproducibility emancipates the work of art from its parasitic subservience to ritual. To an ever-increasing degree, the work reproduced becomes the reproduction of a work designed for reproducibility … … as soon as the criterion of authenticity ceases to be applied to artistic production, the whole social function of art is revolutionized. Instead of being founded on ritual, it is based on a different practice: politics.\n- Art history might be seen as the working out of a tension between two polarities [artwork cult value and its exhibition value] within the artwork itself … … With the emancipation of specific artistic practices from the service of ritual, the opportunities for exhibiting their products increase.\n- The state of their [Greek] technology compelled the Greeks to produce eternal values in their art … … Undoubtedly, our position lies at the opposite pole from that of the Greeks. Never before have artworks been technologically reproducible to such a degree and in such quantities as today … … The film is therefore the artwork most capable of improvement. And this capacity is linked to its radical renunciation of eternal value.\n- … … the intervention in a performance by a body of experts is also characteristic … … of all test performances. The entire process of film production is determined, in fact, by such intervention … … The film actor performs not in front of an audience but in front of an apparatus … … To accomplish it is to preserve one’s humanity in the face of the apparatus. Interest in this performance is widespread. For the majority of city dwellers, throughout the workday in offices and factories, have to relinquish their humanity in the face of an apparatus. In the evening these same masses fill the cinemas, to witness the film actor taking revenge on their behalf not only by asserting his humanity against the apparatus, but by placing that apparatus in the service of his triumph.\n- The magician maintains the natural distance between himself and the person treated; more precisely, he reduces it slightly by laying on his hands, but increases it greatly by his authority. The surgeon does exactly the reverse … … Magician is to surgeon as painter is to cinematographer. The painter maintains in his work a natural distance from reality, whereas the cinematographer penetrates deeply into its tissues.\nprognostic: 预后; lithography: 石刻; elk: 麋鹿; countenance:面容; terra cotta: 兵马俑; hieroglyph: 象形文字; inkling: 暗示; clandestinely: 秘密\n2. Theory of Distraction\n- Just as the art of the Greeks was geared toward lasting, so the art of the present is geared toward becoming worn out. This may happen in two different ways: through consignment of the artwork to fashion or through the work’s refunctioning in politics.\nIII. PAINTING AND GRAPHICS\n18. Painting and the Graphic Arts\n- We might say that there are two sections through the substance of the world: the longitudinal section of painting and the transverse section of certain graphic works. The longitudinal section seems representational — it somehow contains things; the transverse section seems symbolic — it contains signs.', 'Japonism is a term used to describe the influence of Japanese art on European artists. Japonisme was coined in France by Jules Claretie. From Wikipedia: “Japanese wood-block prints became a source of inspiration for many European impressionist painters in France and elsewhere, and eventually for Art Nouveau and Cubism. Artists were especially affected by the lack of perspective and shadow, the flat areas of strong color, and the compositional freedom gained by placing the subject off-center, mostly with a low diagonal axis to the background. “\nI fell in love with Japanese painting and Japanese woodblock printing, last spring when I took my Color Design class. The instructor was teaching us how to create color palettes for either digital or regular painting and he had us download several of these images for the assignment.\nJapanese woodblock (sometimes called woodcut) prints lend themselves perfectly to this training because of their limited, simplistic, yet pleasing palettes. The images I chose to use to create my palettes are shown below. As with most of these prints, artists are unknown.\nFirst we import the image into Photoshop and with the Eyedropper tool we pick out the various colors and fill the rectangles in the color bar with them. At first glance there seems to be just a handful of colors, but with the Eyedropper tool you soon discover that what at first looks to be orange is actually three shades of orange. This fun exercise also required the estimation of the percentage of the whole painting that each color was used. The vertical bar to the right of each painting shows the resulting color palette and the approximate amount of each color.\nAfter you finish this exercise, you can save your palette for a future digital painting, or you can print it in order to mix your own palette from paints, or your choice of medium, from pastels to colored pencil. This method allows one to create art that has pleasing hues and color combinations. It’s also very efficient because you can make all your color decisions up front, prepare your colors in advance, and have a general idea of the overall color tone of your piece.\nI promised myself at the time to collect more of these Japanese woodblock prints for future use. I found several themes in this style of art: nature, floral, fruit, fish and birds, waves, etc. but my favorites are the Geishas. Many of these prints were never signed, so accreditation is rarely possible. For the purposes of this blog, I want to share them with you without details.\nHistory of Woodblock Printing\nDuring the Edo period in Japan (1603-1867) Japan began to adopt the Chinese method of woodblock printing to print books. The earliest known examples of woodblock printing from Japan were small wooden pagodas, each with a woodblock scroll in Buddhist text. One million of these were commissioned by the Empress Koken to give to temples around the country as symbols of thanksgiving that the Emi Rebellion was over.\nWoodblock printing was a method that allowed for the first attempts at mass production. It was used for the printing of many literary materials to include the Japanese classics, travel guides, advice manuals, novels, art books, and plays.\nThe text or image was first drawn on paper, glued to a block of wood (usually cherry), and then the wood was cut away based on the design. Ink was applied to the block and pressed onto paper. This was first done all by hand; later complex mechanisms were invented to hold the wood block still, apply consistent pressure, and allowed for precision alignment when multiple layers of color were later introduced.\nThere were many types of Japanese woodblock printing as technology developed:\nSumizuri-e: Monochrome printing using only black ink\nBenizuri-e: Red or green details or highlights were added to the monochrome\nAizuri-e: A single color, mostly indigo or purple, was used instead of black ink\nUrushi-e: Ink was thickened with glue for relief, and sometimes gold or mica\nNishiki-e: A method of using multiple blocks for different portions of the image, using several colors to achieve complex and detailed designs; registration marks called “kento” were used to align each application of blocks.']	['<urn:uuid:62d93e9c-3b31-4406-9a82-fc1d95bcb1a4>', '<urn:uuid:9e4572e8-4dd3-4130-87f5-1c874950cb89>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	9	39	1494

Most cultures have traditional dishes in which the food is tightly wrapped and cooked at a low temperature for a long time.The modern era of sous vide began in the early 1970s when food researchers and chefs in France searched for a way to reduce product loss when cooking foie gras. They found that by cooking foie gras sous vide, much higher yield and improved texture could be achieved. Since then, chefs have been inspired to step back and thoroughly re-evaluate at which time and temperature to handle ingredients while preserving maximum of its integrity, flavor and color.Today sous vide has become standard in top kitchens worldwide. Food lovers have long admired the amazing flavors and textures that gourmet chefs achieved with sous vide cooking. With equipment and education being now more accessible for home chefs, the idea of guaranteed perfect and repeatable results with very easy steps has made sous vide extremely attractive for home chefs as well. It will add a new dimension to cooking for many aspiring chefs.', ""Hello my little lamb chops!\nCooking for two? A romantic dinner perhaps? Consider the lamb chop—delicate, tender, juicy, and easy. Rub with some chopped herbs, garlic, salt and pepper, and olive oil, let sit for a bit, sear all over on high heat, let rest a few minutes, and serve.\n“Lollipops” of Lamb\nLamb rib chops are cut from the “rack of lamb“, the top part of the back attached to the ribs, and have incredibly tender meat.\nOften the chops are French trimmed, where the meat nearest the ends of of the rib bones is scraped away, making for a more elegant presentation. Individual rib chops prepared this way are sometimes called “lamb lollipops” because the meat is attached to one or two rib bones that you can pick up with your hands like a lollipop.\nDouble Rib vs. Single Rib Lamb Chops\nWhile you can cut individual rib chops from a rack of lamb (you’ll need a cleaver and a rubber mallet), it’s easiest to work with chops already cut.\nYou can either buy double rib lamb chops, with two ribs per chop, or single rib chops. Double rib chops yield a thicker piece of meat than single chops, and are more forgiving with cooking time if you like your lamb rare or medium rare.\nThe chops of single rib chops are thinner, and you’ll have to pay closer attention and sear quickly so as to not overcook them.\nWhich to use? If the lamb chops are small (8 ribs to a pound), I might choose double rib lamb chops. If the lamb chops are meatier (8 ribs to 1 1/2 pounds or more), I might use single rib chops.\nOne pound of chops will serve 2 to 3 people, 1 1/2 pounds will serve 3 to 4.\nYou can also use this recipe with lamb loin chops (a tender cut of meat from further down the backbone and not attached to ribs).\nHow to Cook Lamb Chops\nCooking lamb chops on the stovetop couldn’t be easier!\n- Marinate the lamb chops in a mixture of herbs, garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper.\n- Sear the chops on high heat on the stovetop until browned on both sides.\n- If you have thick double-rib chops and you would like them more well done, cover the pan, lower the heat to warm, or put them in the oven for a few minutes.\n- Rest the lamb chops for 3 to 5 minutes before serving.\nWhy Marinate Lamb Chops?\nMarinating the chops ahead of time serves two purposes. It’s an excellent way to pre-salt the meat, which helps the chops retain moisture while they cook. Marinating with herbs and garlic gives the lamb extra flavor.\nThe marinade in this recipe includes fresh rosemary, salt and pepper, garlic, and olive oil. You could easily substitute other herbs or seasonings if you’d like, such as thyme or herbes de Provence.\nMarinate the lamb chops for at least 30 minutes, or up to 24 hours. If you’re working with double rib chops, let them sit at room temperature 30 to 45 minutes before cooking; single rib chops can be kept refrigerated until time to cook.\nBest Temperature for Lamb Chops\nA lamb chop is such a lovely tender cut of meat, you just don’t have to do much to it. In fact, the only thing you really have to take care with is to not overcook it. Lamb is best eaten pink, from rare to medium. Overcooking tender lamb chops can result in dry, less-than-tender meat. That said, if you have eaters who prefer their meat more well done, you can always cook it longer.\nSince rib chops are so small, and cook so quickly, checking for internal temperature of single rib chops with a thermometer can be impractical. For this reason I like to use the finger test to check the doneness of the chops. If you have an instant read thermometer and want to check thicker chops, aim for 125°F for rare, 135°F medium-rare, and 140°F medium.\nWhat to Serve with Lamb Chops\nMy favorite adornment to lamb chops is mint chimichurri, a pesto-like sauce made with parsley, mint, and garlic. You can also make a pan sauce with the drippings by quickly sautéing some shallots in the pan, adding a little broth, water, or red wine, reducing the mixture, then stirring in a little butter at the end.\nWe love lamb chops served with polenta, mashed potatoes, or celery root. For a green, some stir-fried snow peas or boiled and sautéed asparagus or green beans. A light mixed green salad, simply dressed with extra virgin olive oil and vinegar is lovely too.\nLove Lamb? Try These Recipes:\n- Lamb Curry\n- Lamb Stew with Root Vegetables\n- Greek Lamb Burgers with Tzatziki Sauce\n- Spicy Lamb Stew with Chickpeas\nLamb Chops with Rosemary and Garlic Recipe\nDouble rib lamb chops, with two ribs per chop, will yield a thicker piece of meat than single rib chops, and are more forgiving with cooking time if you like your lamb rare or medium rare.\nWith single rib chops, which are thinner pieces, you'll have to pay closer attention, and sear quickly, to not overcook the chops.\nThe flavor of lamb is best when prepared rare or medium rare. Error on less cooking time than you would expect, that way you can cook them further if you want them more well done.\n- 1 pound lamb rib chops\n- 2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary\n- 2 teaspoons salt\n- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n- 1 garlic clove, minced\n- 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided\n1 Marinate the lamb chops: In a small bowl, mix the rosemary, salt, pepper, garlic, and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil together. Coat the lamb chops with the mixture, massaging it into the meat with your fingers. If you are working with double rib chops, cover and let stand at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes.\nIf you are working with single rib chops, and you want the result to be rare, let the chops sit in the rub in the refrigerator, do not let come to room temp or the thin ribs will easily overcook when you sear them in the next step.\nYou can also marinate the chops in the fridge for up to 24 hours. (Allow double rib chops to stand at room temperature 30 to 40 minutes before cooking.)\n2 Sear the lamb chops: Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in an oven-proof sauté pan over high heat. When the oil is shimmering hot, sear the chops. Sear double rib chops on all sides about 2 to 3 minutes per side. If you are working with single rib chops, sear only on two sides, and only a minute (or less) on each side if you want the result to be rare or medium rare.\n3 Check for doneness: At this point, if you want your lamb chops rare, they are likely cooked enough.\nIf you would like your chops more cooked, you can put them in a 400°F oven for 3 to 5 minutes, or keep them in the hot pan, lower the heat to warm, and cover the pan for a few minutes.\nNote that rib chops are so small, and cook so quickly, checking for internal temperature with a thermometer can be impractical. For this reason I use the finger test to check the doneness of the chops. That said, if you have an instant read thermometer and want to check thick chops, aim for 125°F for rare, 135°F medium-rare, and 140°F for medium.\n4 Rest the chops: When done, remove the chops from the pan, cover with foil and let rest 3 to 5 minutes before serving.\nHello!

79	california agriculture crop value impacted three day flight ban terrorist attack	During the three-day shutdown of aviation following the September 11 attacks, California crops valued at approximately $3 billion were threatened with pest infestation due to the inability to use aerial applications. The affected crops included cotton, sweet corn, tomatoes, alfalfa, beans, melons, leafy greens, broccoli and many others.	['Editor’s Note: The following is a commentary written by the California Agricultural Aviation Association’s President, Terry Gage.\nSeptember 11, 2001: For agricultural pilots, it was the first time in their lives that the entire national aviation fleet was grounded. Every commercial aircraft and every private plane-the entire U.S. aviation industry-came to a standstill while the nation struggled to understand the unthinkable and our security forces scrambled to mitigate further terrorist attacks.\nAs a nation, we understood the need to restrict aviation, but this had unintended consequences for agricultural production. In California, it was estimated that crops threatened with pest infestation during the three-day shutdown were valued at around $3 billion. Cotton, sweet corn, tomatoes, alfalfa, beans, melons, leafy greens, broccoli and many more crops were vulnerable without the ability to use aerial applications.\nAcross the nation, the impacts grew. Fortunately, aerial-application operators, known as Part 137 Operators under federal regulations, were the first in general aviation to be able to get back in the air, due to tremendous grassroots efforts involving calls to the White House, Congress, Federal Aviation Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture and several other agencies.\nOn Sept. 14, ag pilots got back in the air and to work-only to be subjected to another ground stop on the 16th. The FBI began scrutinizing the aerial application industry after a manual on aerial application was found in the belongings of suspected terrorists. The California Agricultural Aircraft Association was contacted by the task force on terrorism. CAAA cooperated fully with the task force, by providing background on the aerial application industry and contact information for all operators and pilots. This more than likely happened individually for all states, meaning pilots may have been subjected to a background check in Hawaii and every other state with various aviation associations.\nOn the national front, the FBI and the FAA contacted the National Agricultural Aviation Association for the same information on the national level. The federal government performed background checks on aerial operators and pilots throughout the country and created an inventory of agricultural aircraft in service. Aerial applications were allowed to resume on Sept. 17.\nThere was a lot of attention on the aerial application industry during this time. As a small part of general aviation, there were a lot of unknowns when it came to our abilities and capabilities. The industry continued to field calls and questions from the media and government officials.\nSuddenly, “crop dusting” planes were in political cartoons, and members of the public called officials when they saw a plane in the air. Many times, the application was miles away-but due to the media coverage, planes were now a threat. There were several reports of concerned citizens calling in a “crop duster” to later find out it was a different type of aircraft.\nAerial applicators were grounded again on Sept. 23, when rumors of a suspected terrorist visiting a Florida aerial operator circulated in national media. What the media didn’t report was that the operator refused to discuss any industry specifics with the individual.\nDuring this time, there was a misconception that aerial dispersion systems used to control weeds and pests could be hijacked and used to vaporize toxins over urban areas, threatening public health. Those in the application industry know that aerial-application systems are designed to produce specific droplet sizes that fall onto the target site. Our dispersion systems cannot vaporize anything and doing so would require significant re-engineering and design.\nOn Sept. 25, we were back in the air providing valuable services to our agricultural commodities, but we would continue to work with authorities during the next several years, verifying information and correcting misunderstandings on ag aircraft and their capabilities.\nAfter a public hearing on Nov. 28, 2001, the state Assembly Committee on Agriculture determined that the current regulatory structure was adequate. The committee reviewed the various agencies and entities that maintain oversight, which included the FAA, California Highway Patrol, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, California Department of Pesticide Regulation, county agricultural commissioners and many others. At the hearing, an FBI agent stated, “We didn’t know that they (crop dusters) were so regulated.”\nFortunately, the NAAA Professional Aerial Applicator Support System, or PAASS, had already been in place for a couple of years. This educational program educates pilots annually on key safety and drift-minimization issues. After 9/11, the program incorporated an airfield watch/security segment, which remains a part of the program. This allowed the industry to promote additional airfield security measures for aircraft and equipment, to address any public concerns about using our aircraft or equipment for nefarious activities. Additional precautions of hidden kill switches, disabling equipment, utilization of electronic monitoring and establishing lines of communication with local law enforcement for reporting any suspicious activities were discussed and promoted.\nCAAA would continue to be contacted by various federal and state agencies. Our members kept the lines of communication open with the FBI, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, FAA, CDFA, DPR and other agencies. In 2003, the FBI conducted follow-up visits to operators across the nation. Throughout this time, operators increased their security plans and agreed to forward any suspicious requests to the Department of Homeland Security. In the years since then, we have continued to interact with FAA and Homeland Security.\nWhat did this teach us? We found out the importance of having programs in place to educate and enlighten those who don’t understand what we do. Additionally, if it were not for our proactive involvement with various regulatory entities, our shutdown could have been longer and more devastating for our members and the grower community.\n(Terry Gage is president of the California Agricultural Aircraft Association in Lincoln, CA.)\nReprinted from the California Farm Bureau Federation']	['<urn:uuid:255fe0d6-3cbd-4495-bc0a-5a1835e4476e>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	11	48	950

The New Economic Geography model relies on three key hypotheses: positive transport costs, increasing returns to scale and monopolistic competition, and factor mobility.

It is difficult to answer. At global level and in the long run the answer is probably positive. Look at the video which shows the long run correlation between health and GDP per capita at global level.\nAgglomeration At European level, a tendency towards convergence after the second world war can be detected at national level Looking at the last decade, some backward European countries have grown very fast and narrowed dramatically the gap with the advanced countries\nAgglomeration Growth however in these countries has often been spatially very unbalanced Backward regions in the backward countries have grown more than all regions in advanced countries but much less than advanced regions of their own countries\nAgglomeration The impact of the present economic crisis has been felt by all countries However it hit different countries in different ways It is very difficult to forecast how and when the various countries will emerge from the present crisis\nReal GDP growth rate -

Whether agglomeration will take place or not depends on the relative values of transport costs, fixed costs, share of immobile population. High transport costs and an high share of immobile population are an obstacle for agglomeration while high fixed costs are an incentive for agglomeration\nAgglomeration – There are then multiple equilibria. You can find equilibrium producing manufacturing entirely in West, entirely at East or with two plants both at west and at east\nAgglomeration – You can also appreciate that when t=0 (no transport cost) the solution of one plant is always convenient. The world is flat. Spatial distance is irrelevant and the firm can locate the plant indifferently everywhere.\nAgglomeration Other centripetal and centrifugal forces play a role in the agglomeration and dispersion processes Other centripetal forces: – Backward and forward linkages – External economies Specialised providers of inputs Pooling of specialised labour force\nAgglomeration Complete and rapid flows of information and knowledge Other features of the context: institutions, social cohesion, social capital, environment, public goods\nAgglomeration Centrifugal forces – Price effect – Congestion costs and diseconomies of scale – Share of immobile factors\nAgglomeration and integration Agglomeration and European economic integration Expected positive effects of European economic integration Cohesion policies, single market and European monetary Union Potential spatial asymmetric effects of European economic integration\nAgglomeration and integration Integration may favour agglomeration because – It lowers trade costs – It increases the scope for increasing returns – It increases the mobility of factors of production\nAgglomeration and integration The potential asymmetric effects of integration as a strong motivation for European cohesion policies The historical link between cohesion policy on one side and single market and monetary unification on the other Compatibility and complementarity between single market and cohesion policy at the heart of the European social model']"	['<urn:uuid:769c5867-b8d4-47f9-b238-799dc2bc222b>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	20	23	1471

"[""Figure 1: Typical above ground growth of the storage root after 60 days. Photo credit: Joel Gruver, Western Illinois University.\nThe deep roots of radishes, and the voids that winterkilled and decayed radishes create, have led some farmers to “bio strip-till” with the popular cover crop, says a recent report by several university experts.\nThe radish attribute that has captured the most farmer interest is their robust rooting ability, according to researchers Joel Gruver, Western Illinois University; Ray Weil, University of Maryland; Charles White, Penn State University, and Yvonne Lawley, University of Manitoba.\nUnder favorable growing conditions, radish roots can extend more than 3 feet deep in 60 days, with the thickened storage portion of the root extending more than 12 inches. Plants with roots more than 1 inch in diameter normally have a significant portion of the root exposed above ground (often more than 4 inches, even in uncompacted soils) (Fig. 1).\nAfter radishes winter kill and their large fleshy roots desiccate, the channels created by the roots tend to remain open at the soil surface, improving infiltration, surface drainage, and soil warming (Fig. 2).\nRadish rooting effects on soil porosity also extend into the subsoil. This general process called bio-drilling, can improve root growth by subsequent crops and access to subsoil moisture resulting in greater resilience under drought conditions.\nFigure 2. Radish holes after winter kill. Photo credit: Joel Gruver, Western Illinois University.\nResearch at the University of Maryland has shown that radish roots have greater ability to penetrate compacted soil than cereal rye and rapeseed. Subsequent research found twice as many corn roots penetrated compacted subsoil after radish cover cropping as compared to cereal rye, with both cover crops promoting more rooting than bare-fallow (Fig. 3). These results suggest radishes may be useful as a biological alternative to deep ripping and other mechanical methods of alleviating soil compaction.\nSome farmers and researchers are currently evaluating bio strip-till strategies, which involve targeted fall planting of radishes on the wide rows, e.g., 30 inches, where a subsequent cash crop will be planted the next spring. This approach reduces seed cost and may maximize crop utilization of radish-root channels, but this requires precise equipment guidance in the field.\nRadish Impacts Erosion\nRadishes grow rapidly when planted in late summer or early fall and 10 pounds per acre drilled on 7.5-inch rows can provide full canopy closure in about 3 weeks. This canopy intercepts raindrops minimizing surface impact and detachment of soil particles.\nFigure 8. Impact of radish on soil loss. Figure credit: Ray Weil, University of Maryland.\nEven after radishes are killed by a hard freeze, a layer of decomposing residue remains on the soil surface throughout the winter and into the early spring, providing erosion control. In addition, runoff and sediment transport are reduced because of the rapid infiltration facilitated by open root holes.\nThese holes can capture run-off and sediment before it leaves the field. For more complete protection against erosion, radish can be mixed with other cover crops that are winter hardy, e.g., cereal rye, or winter kill but leave more persistent residue cover, e.g., oats.\nGood stands of radishes can be established by drilling 6–10 pounds per acre or broadcasting at 8-12 pounds per acre. When using a drill, seed should be placed about 1 inch deep. When broadcasting, establishment is enhanced by culti-packing or light tillage.\nThere is growing interest in planting radishes on wider row spacing (Fig. 10), often in combination with other cover crop species. This can be accomplished by blocking off rows in a drill or using a planter with appropriate plates or another seed metering system appropriate for radish seed.\nFigure 10. Radish planted on 30-inch rows at the Western Illinois University Organic research farm in Roseville, IL. (a) Planting radishes on 30-inch rows with a Buffalo planter. (b) Radish planted on 30-inch rows with some volunteer spring wheat. (c) Cultivation may be needed to control weeds in radishes planted on 30-inch rows without a companion species. Photo credits: Joel Gruver, Western Illinois University.\nEstablishing radishes with a planter has particular appeal because many farmers have wider planters than drills, seed spacing is more controlled than with a drill and lower seeding rates can be used. Specific planter plate recommendations are summarized in the following table (Table 1).\nRadishes germinate rapidly, emerging within 3–4 days when environmental conditions are favorable. Seed broadcast on the surface can establish well if seeding is followed by a timely rain or irrigation.\nTable 1. Recommended planter plates for cover crop radish.\nPlanter Plate White 60-cell sugar beet\nDeere small sugar beet 4/64 inch\nCase-IH sugar beet\nKinze 2000 and 3000 series small 60-cell milo\nKinze Edge Vac w/ e-sets 60-cell small sugar beet 1/16 inch\nMonosem 6020 plate; vacuum set to 15\nRadishes have a very flexible and aggressive growth habit and will spread out in a rosette to fill available space. Radish plants (roots and shoots) grow much larger at lower plant densities, but it's not clear that giant specimens (e.g., greater than 3-inch diameter roots) have any advantage over good stands of radishes with 1-inch-diameter roots (Fig. 11).\nFigure 11. Typical radishes after about 60 days of growth with abundant water and nutrients—much larger radishes are possible but have more value at the county fair than in your fields. Photo credit: Joel Gruver, Western Illinois University.\nRadishes grow best when planted early enough to allow 6 weeks of growth before regular frosts. Later-planted radishes tend to be more cold-hardy and less likely to winter kill. When planted in the spring, most radishes bolt quickly producing much less root and shoot biomass than fall plantings.\nRadishes are tolerant of light frosts, but generally show injury when temperatures fall below the mid-20s F.\nIn regions where winter temperatures regularly drop below 20 F, radishes normally winter kill, but overwintering was reported at some northern locations in 2010 and 2012, likely due to early and persistent snow cover and unusually mild winter conditions, respectively.\nYoung radishes in the rosette growth stage are more winter hardy than radishes that have developed a sizable storage root.\nRadishes fit well following small grains, corn silage, and early harvested vegetable crops, e.g., sweet corn, that allows cover crop planting before Sept. 1. Later plantings can scavenge significant amounts of nitrogen, but may accomplish little bio-drilling or weed suppression. Nutrients scavenged by radishes are released rapidly making radishes a good fit ahead of early planted crops with high nutrient requirements. Caution should be taken when adding radishes to rotations that already include brassicas.\nCover Crop Mixtures\nMany farmers and researchers are experimenting with cover crop mixtures that combine radish with other cover crops that fix nitrogen, provide more persistent residues or simply have cheaper seed. As a general rule, radish rates should be cut by at least 50% when included in cover crop mixtures because of their capacity to out-compete other species.\nFigure 12. Alternating 15-inch rows of radish and oats. Photo credit: Joel Gruver, Western Illinois University.\nAn alternative method of managing radish competition in mixtures is to plant separate rows of radishes and companion species (Fig. 12). This can be accomplished by blocking off or compartmentalizing the rows in the seed boxes of a grain drill or by attaching an additional seed metering/distribution system, e.g., Valmar airflo or Gandy Orbit-air.\nIn addition, some farmers are using split-row planters to plant alternating rows of radish and companion species on 15-inch spacing or planting twice on 30-inch rows with a 15-inch offset using GPS guidance.\nRadishes have little tolerance of wet soils, so planting in fields that collect standing water or are prone to prolonged wetness should be avoided. Enhanced growth directly over tile lines is common and plugging of tile lines has been reported but appears to be a rare occurrence.\nRadishes are very responsive to nitrogen, and nitrogen deficiency limits their ability to compete with weeds, grow through compacted soil, and perform other potential functions. Nitrogen deficiencies have been observed when planting after silage- or grain corn on sandy soils or on soils that do not have a history of manure application. Nitrogen deficiencies are also likely when excessively high populations are established."", 'SEED CALCULATOR ❌\nNumber of Plants 0\nWeight 0 oz\nat 0 seeds per foot\nSEED CALCULATOR ❌\nNumber of Seeds: 0\nSeeds per 100 feet: 0\nGenerally 15 to 20 pounds of seed per acre (13 – 20 kg/hectare ); may be as low as 3 to 5 pounds for dryland seeding. Sow 1/2 pound per 1000 square feet. Use half these rates when mixed with grain or grass. Seed must be placed in contact with moist soil, but never deeper than 1/2”. For best survival, seed should be drilled to a depth of 1/4”. Seeding should be followed by cultipacking rolling to firm the soil around the seed. Severe compaction should be avoided. Companion crops are not recommended except where wind erosion may be a problem. Sow early in the season so germination will preclude weeds, alfalfa does not compete well with weeds early in the establishment sequence. For all sowing, plant 6-8 weeks before the first killing frost in the late summer to allow good establishment going into winter. Organic systems should plant 1/3 to 1/2 heavier to allow for some weed pressures.\nSeed bed should be finely pulverized, leveled, and firmed with soil moisture near the surface to help initiate germination. Low spots and dead furrows should be eliminated. Determined by seasonal temperature and moisture conditions. Most sowings are made from April to early June to allow root systems to develop before high temperatures and low moisture conditions slow growth rate. Late summer and early fall sowings must be in time to allow enough growth to minimize loss from winter injury.\nAlfalfa does best on deep, permeable soil with an adequate moisture supply during the growing season. Most varieties very sensitive to poor drainage and compacted soil conditions which restrict root growth. Most productive on loam or loamy soils, well drained, with good moisture holding capacity or with adequate irrigation. Alfalfa has autotoxicity, which means it is difficult for alfalfa seed to grow in existing stands of alfalfa. Therefore, alfalfa fields are recommended to be rotated with other species, for example, corn or wheat, before reseeding. Effective annual precipitation needed: 12”.\nAlfalfa is a heavy user of plant nutrients. A complete fertilizer program is essential to a long lived productive stand. Fertilizer and lime applications should be based on soil tests. Fall applications of lime prior to seeding are best to provide time for soil reaction. Potassium, sulfur and boron, when indicated by soil tests , should not be banded with the seed, but should be worked into the soil before seeding. Phosphorus may be applied effectively by banding 1/2 to 1” to the side or below the seed, or by shallow incorporation just prior to seeding. Inoculate for best performance.\nFor best results, till under when in the flowering stage.\n25-lb., 50-lb. and larger sizes ship via ground transportation.

82	How do residential spaces support both health and EVs?	Residential spaces play crucial roles in both health and EV adoption. For health, homes provide control over food preparation, helping avoid bacteria exposure that causes digestive issues during travel. In the EV context, residential buildings are major charging points, particularly in the US where wealthy homeowners can upgrade their electrical infrastructure. However, this creates a disparity as less wealthy people in apartments need public charging infrastructure, similar to how travelers lose control over food preparation when away from home.	"['Summer getaways should be all about rest and relaxation. Unfortunately, decadent meals, late nights out, and fun in the wild outdoors can leave you feeling worse than you did before you left. But with a little planning, you can return home healthy and happy and even hold on to that feeling. Stay-well strategies to add to your itinerary:\nBefore You Leave...\n- Shore up your immune system. Digestive problems, from gas and indigestion to diarrhea, are all too common when you\'re on the road. ""Eating out means you have less control over food preparation, exposing you to bacteria like E. coli and salmonella,"" says Patricia Raymond, M.D., an assistant professor of clinical internal medicine at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk. Prevent tummy troubles by popping probiotics — supplements that help keep your GI tract healthy — for three days before a trip. ""Aim to take 1 billion CFUs [colony-forming units] a day,"" Raymond suggests. (Look for pills containing S. boulardi to ward off Montezuma\'s revenge.) Meanwhile, more than one in five plane passengers will catch a cold within a week of their flight, research shows, so ""bolster your immunity by getting seven to eight hours of sleep for several nights before you leave,"" says Michael P. Zimring, M.D., author of Healthy Travel. And because stress really does make you sick, pack a couple of days in advance, using a checklist.\n- Be prepared. Put together a health kit that includes an antacid, an antidiarrheal medication, bandages, pain relievers such as aspirin or Tylenol, an antihistamine, sanitizing wipes, and your prescription medications (including liquids of more than three ounces, which can be carried on a plane if they\'re for medical use).\nWhile You\'re Away...\n- Stay active. Lounge on a hammock all you want, but get in some activity too, or you\'ll have extra pounds as a vacation souvenir. It\'s easier — and more fun — than you think: Swim (205 calories burned in 30 minutes), play tennis (239 calories), hike (204 calories), or bike (272 calories). In a city? Sightsee (112 calories) or go dancing (153 calories).\n- Indulge — to a point. ""Pick one meal a day as your splurge,"" Zimring suggests. Otherwise, stick to lower-calorie foods high in filling protein and fiber, such as fruit, egg-white omelets, salads and wraps filled with veggies and lean meats, and fish. You\'ll have more energy for fun and avoid weight gain.\n- Protect yourself from the elements. Apply sunscreen with SPF 30 (or higher) any time you\'re outdoors. If you\'re visiting a heavily wooded area, use an insect repellent with at least 30 percent DEET, and wear long pants and thick socks to avoid catching West Nile virus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, or Lyme disease from tick and mosquito bites.\nWhen You Get Back...\n- Ease into your routine. Don\'t dismiss the blues, a.k.a. post-vacation syndrome (yes, that feeling has a name!). Taking an extra day off from work after your return, hanging vacation photos at home or at the office, and slowly resuming your usual activities and eating habits will keep the stress-free spirit of your trip alive.', 'There is a surge in the number of Electric Vehicles (EVs) on the roads across many parts of the world.

The regions with the most EVs are China, the United States, and the European Union. In these countries, the major charging points are in residential and commercial buildings. Upgrading these buildings’ electrical infrastructure will be crucial to ensure a constant supply of electric power needed for the growing number of electric vehicles.\nBy 2030, there could be over 130 million electric vehicles on the world’s roads. According to a top consulting firm, McKinsey & Company, expansion of charging points and capacity will require about $110-$180billion.These charging stations will be distributed across residential places, workplaces, and public spaces such as parking lots and malls. Urban planners, building developers, and electrical equipment suppliers need to come together to come up with buildings with great electrical infrastructure in their future projects. Existing buildings also need to be upgraded to provide adequate access to EV charging points as demand rises.\nEV sales are projected to Skyrocket in the next 5 years. For instance, in the EU, the number of EVs on the roads is expected to increase fourfold. In the US, the sales of EVs are expected to double. Generally, the three top players in the EV market will have over 50 million passenger vehicles and four million commercial vehicles by 2025.\nThe acceleration of EV sales has been influenced by the decreased car prices and the policy measures put in place by governments. For instance, Denmark imposed a ban on the sale of gas-fueled vehicles, effective by 2030. In the US, the state of California has given manufacturers up to 2035 to sell gas-powered vehicles. Charging point’s availability depends on the driving patterns and availability of infrastructure. In the US, most charging points are in residential places. This is because most EV users are the wealthy class who has their own homes. The homeowners don’t mind an electrical upgrade to accommodate electricity needs that come with owning an EV.\nLess wealthy people are embracing EVs. This calls for the installation of public charging stations in workplaces and apartment buildings, where most of these middle class live. In China and the UK, homeownership is not well established. This has resulted in a higher number of electric vehicles compared to the number of charging points, thereby increasing the demand.\nProperty owners need to add charging points on their buildings, both AC level 2 chargers and DC fast chargers. The latter might take longer to install as they require large batteries. EVs will need about 50 million AC charge points distributed across homes, workplaces, and recreational places in China, the EU, and the US. Fleet operators also need to upgrade their depot electricity infrastructure to meet the increasing demands as commercial EVs enter the market.']"	['<urn:uuid:662ace07-2ab5-42b8-a240-56014cb31356>', '<urn:uuid:37dadfe7-64bf-4b4f-a9b6-38b8d20984c8>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	9	79	1029
83	What happens when you don't get enough vitamin D?	Vitamin D deficiency can cause several health problems. In adults, it may lead to muscle weakness, bone loss, and increased risk of fractures. In children, vitamin D deficiency can cause growth delays and soft bones (rickets). The deficiency may also weaken immune function and increase cancer risk. The symptoms are usually subtle and can develop over years or decades.	['By Adda Bjarnadottir Authority Nutrition\nMany nutrients are absolutely essential for good health.\nIt is possible to get most of them from a balanced, real food-based diet.\nHowever, the typical modern diet lacks several very important nutrients.\nThis article lists 7 nutrient deficiencies that are incredibly common.\n1. Iron Deficiency\nIron is an essential mineral.\nIt is a main component of red blood cells, where it binds with hemoglobin and transports oxygen to cells.\nThere are actually two types of dietary iron:\n- Heme iron: This type of iron is very well absorbed. It is only found in animal foods, and red meat contains particularly high amounts.\n- Non-heme iron: This type of iron is more common, and is found in both animal and plant foods. It is not absorbed as easily as heme iron.\nIron deficiency is one of the most common nutrient deficiencies in the world, affecting more than 25% of people worldwide (1, 2).\nThis number rises to 47% in preschool children. Unless they’re given iron-rich, or iron-fortified foods, they are very likely to lack iron.\n30% of menstruating women may be deficient as well, due to monthly blood loss. Up to 42% of young, pregnant women may also suffer from iron deficiency.\nAdditionally, vegetarians and vegans have an increased risk of deficiency. They consume only non-heme iron, which is not absorbed as well as heme iron (3, 4).\nThe most common consequence of iron deficiency is anemia. The quantity of red blood cells is decreased, and the blood becomes less able to carry oxygen throughout the body.\nSymptoms usually include tiredness, weakness, weakened immune system and impaired brain function (5, 6).\nThe best dietary sources of heme iron include (7):\n- Red meat: 3 ounces (85 g) of ground beef provides almost 30% of the RDI.\n- Organ meat: One slice of liver (81 g) provides more than 50% of the RDI.\n- Shellfish, such as clams, mussels and oysters: 3 ounces (85 g) of cooked oysters provide roughly 50% of the RDI.\n- Canned sardines: One 3.75 ounce can (106 g) provides 34% of the RDI.\nThe best dietary sources of non-heme iron include (7):\n- Beans: Half a cup of cooked kidney beans (3 ounces or 85 g) provides 33% of the RDI.\n- Seeds, such as pumpkin, sesame and squash seeds: One ounce (28 g) of roasted pumpkin and squash seeds provide 11% of the RDI.\n- Broccoli, kale and spinach: One ounce (28 g) of fresh kale provides 5.5% of the RDI.\nHowever, you should never supplement with iron unless you truly need it. Too much iron can be very harmful.\nAdditionally, vitamin C can enhance the absorption of iron. Eating vitamin C-rich foods like oranges, kale and bell peppers along with iron-rich foods can help maximize iron absorption.\nBottom Line: Iron deficiency is very common, especially among young women, children and vegetarians. It may cause anemia, tiredness, weakness, weakened immune system and impaired brain function.\n2. Iodine Deficiency\nIodine is an essential mineral for normal thyroid function and the production of thyroid hormones (8).\nThyroid hormones are involved in many processes in the body, such as growth, brain development and bone maintenance. They also regulate the metabolic rate.\nIodine deficiency is one of the most common nutrient deficiencies in the world. It affects nearly one-third of the world’s population (9, 10, 11).\nThe most common symptom of iodine deficiency is an enlarged thyroid gland, also known as goiter. It may also cause an increase in heart rate, shortness of breath and weight gain (8).\nSevere iodine deficiency may also cause serious adverse effects, especially in children. These include mental retardation and developmental abnormalities (8, 10).\nThere are several good dietary sources of iodine:\n- Seaweed: Only 1 g of kelp contains 460–1000% of the RDI.\n- Fish: 3 ounces (85 g) of baked cod provide 66% of the RDI.\n- Dairy: One cup of plain yogurt provides about 50% of the RDI.\n- Eggs: One large egg provides 16% of the RDI.\nHowever, keep in mind that these amounts can vary greatly. Iodine is found mostly in the soil and the sea, so if the soil is iodine-poor then the food growing in it will be low in iodine as well.\nSome countries have responded to iodine deficiency by adding it to salt, which has successfully reduced the severity of the problem (12).\nBottom Line: Iodine is one of the most common nutrient deficiencies in the world. It may cause enlargement of the thyroid gland. Severe iodine deficiency can cause mental retardation and developmental abnormalities in children.\n3. Vitamin D Deficiency\nVitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that works like a steroid hormone in the body.\nIt travels through the bloodstream and into cells, telling them to turn genes on or off.\nAlmost every cell in the body has a receptor for vitamin D.\nVitamin D is produced out of cholesterol in the skin when it is exposed to sunlight. So people who live far from the equator are highly likely to be deficient, since they have less sun exposure (13, 14).\nIn the US, about 42% of people may be vitamin D deficient. This number rises to 74% in the elderly and 82% in people with dark skin, since their skin produces less vitamin D in response to sunlight (15, 16).\nVitamin D deficiency is not usually visible. The symptoms are subtle and may develop over years or decades (17, 18).\nAdults who are deficient in vitamin D may experience muscle weakness, bone loss and increased risk of fractures. In children, it may cause growth delays and soft bones (rickets) (17, 20, 21).\nAlso, vitamin D deficiency may play a role in reduced immune function and an increased risk of cancer (22).\nUnfortunately, very few foods contain significant amounts of this vitamin.\nThe best dietary sources of vitamin D are (23):\n- Cod liver oil: A single tablespoon contains 227% of the RDI.\n- Fatty fish, such as salmon, mackerel, sardines or trout: A small, 3-ounce serving of cooked salmon (85 g) contains 75% of the RDI.\n- Egg yolks: One large egg yolk contains 7% of the RDI.\nPeople who are truly deficient in vitamin D may want to take a supplement or increase their sun exposure. It is very hard to get sufficient amounts through diet alone.\nBottom Line: Vitamin D deficiency is very common. Symptoms include muscle weakness, bone loss, increased risk of fractures and soft bones in children. It is very difficult to get sufficient amounts from diet alone.\n4. Vitamin B12 Deficiency\nVitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin.\nIt is essential for blood formation, as well as for brain and nerve function.\nEvery cell in your body needs B12 to function normally, but the body is unable to produce it. Therefore, we must get it from food or supplements.\nVitamin B12 is only found in animal foods (with the exception of nori seaweed and tempeh — see here). Therefore, people who do not eat animal products are at an increased risk of deficiency.\nStudies have shown that vegetarians and vegans are highly likely to be deficient in vitamin B12. Some numbers go as high as 80–90% (24, 25).\nMore than 20% of elderly people may also be deficient in vitamin B12, since absorption decreases with age (26, 27, 28).\nThe absorption of vitamin B12 is more complex than the absorption of other vitamins, because it needs help from a protein known as intrinsic factor.\nSome people are lacking in this protein, and may therefore need B12 injections or higher doses of supplements.\nOne common symptom of vitamin B12 deficiency is megaloblastic anemia, which is a blood disorder that enlarges the red blood cells.\nOther symptoms include impaired brain function and elevated homocysteine levels, which is a risk factor for several diseases (29, 30).\nDietary sources of vitamin B12 include (7):\n- Shellfish, especially clams and oysters: A 3-ounce (85 g) portion of cooked clams provides 1400% of the RDI.\n- Organ meat: One 2-ounce slice (60 grams) of liver provides more than 1000% of the RDI.\n- Meat: A small, 6-ounce beef steak (170 grams) provides 150% the RDI.\n- Eggs: Each whole egg provides about 6% of the RDI.\n- Milk products: One cup of whole milk provides about 18% of the RDI.\nLarge amounts of B12 are not considered harmful, because it is often poorly absorbed and excess amounts are expelled via urine.\nBottom Line: Vitamin B12 deficiency is very common, especially in vegetarians and the elderly. The most common symptoms include a blood disorder, impaired brain function and elevated homocysteine levels.\n5. Calcium Deficiency\nCalcium is essential for every cell. It mineralizes bone and teeth, especially during times of rapid growth. It is also very important for the maintenance of bone.\nAdditionally, calcium plays a role as a signaling molecule all over the body. Without it, our heart, muscles and nerves would not be able to function.\nThe calcium concentration in the blood is tightly regulated, and any excess is stored in bones. If there is lack of calcium in the diet, calcium is released from the bones.\nThat is why the most common symptom of calcium deficiency is osteoporosis, characterized by softer and more fragile bones.\nOne survey found that in the US, less than 15% of teenage girls and less than 10% of women over 50 met the recommended calcium intake (31).\nIn the same survey, less than 22% of young, teenage boys and men over 50 met the recommended calcium intake from diet alone. Supplement use increased these numbers slightly, but the majority of people were still not getting enough calcium.\nSymptoms of more severe dietary calcium deficiency include soft bones (rickets) in children and osteoporosis, especially in the elderly (32, 33).\nDietary sources of calcium include (7):\n- Boned fish: One can of sardines contains 44% of the RDI.\n- Dairy products: One cup of milk contains 35% of the RDI.\n- Dark green vegetables, such as kale, spinach, bok choy and broccoli: One ounce of fresh kale provides 5.6% of the RDI.\nThe effectiveness and safety of calcium supplements have been somewhat debated in the last few years.\nSome studies have found an increased risk of heart disease in people taking calcium supplements, although other studies have found no effects (34, 35, 36).\nAlthough it is best to get calcium from food rather than supplements, calcium supplements seem to benefit people who are not getting enough in their diet (37).\nBottom Line: Low calcium intake is very common, especially in young females and the elderly. The main symptom of calcium deficiency is an increased risk of osteoporosis in old age.\n6. Vitamin A Deficiency\nVitamin A is an essential fat-soluble vitamin. It helps form and maintain healthy skin, teeth, bones and cell membranes.\nFurthermore, it produces our eye pigments – which are necessary for vision (38).\nThere are two different types of dietary vitamin A:\n- Preformed vitamin A: This type of vitamin A is found in animal products like meat, fish, poultry and dairy.\n- Pro-vitamin A: This type of vitamin A is found in plant-based foods like fruits and vegetables. Beta-carotene, which the body turns into vitamin A, is the most common form.\nMore than 75% of people who eat a western diet are getting more than enough vitamin A and do not need to worry about deficiency (39).\nHowever, vitamin A deficiency is very common in many developing countries. About 44–50% of preschool-aged children in certain regions have vitamin A deficiency. This number is around 30% in Indian women (40, 41).\nVitamin A deficiency can cause both temporary and permanent eye damage, and may even lead to blindness. In fact, vitamin A deficiency is the world’s leading cause of blindness.\nVitamin A deficiency can also suppress immune function and increase mortality, especially among children and pregnant or lactating women (40).\nDietary sources of preformed vitamin A include (7):\n- Organ meat: One 2-ounce slice (60 g) of beef liver provides more than 800% the RDI.\n- Fish liver oil: One tablespoon contains roughly 500% the RDI.\nDietary sources of beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A) include (7):\n- Sweet potatoes: One medium, 6-ounce boiled sweet potato (170 g) contains 150% of the RDI.\n- Carrots: One large carrot provides 75% of the RDI.\n- Dark green leafy vegetables: One ounce (28 g) of fresh spinach provides 18% of the RDI.\nWhile it is very important to consume enough vitamin A, it is generally not recommended to consume very large amounts of preformed vitamin A, as it may cause toxicity.\nThis does not apply to pro-vitamin A, such as beta-carotene. High intake may cause the skin to become slightly orange, but it is not dangerous.\nBottom Line: Vitamin A deficiency is very common in many developing countries. It may cause eye damage and lead to blindness, as well as suppress immune function and increase mortality among women and children.\n7. Magnesium Deficiency\nMagnesium is a key mineral in the body.\nIt is essential for bone and teeth structure, and is also involved in more than 300 enzyme reactions (42).\nAlmost half of the US population (48%) consumed less than the required amount of magnesium in 2005-2006 (43).\nLow intake and blood levels of magnesium have been associated with several diseases, including type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, heart disease and osteoporosis (43, 44).\nLow levels of magnesium are particularly common among hospitalized patients. Some studies find that 9–65% of them are magnesium deficient (45, 46, 47).\nThis may be caused by disease, drug use, reduced digestive function or inadequate magnesium intake (48).\nThe main symptoms of severe magnesium deficiency include abnormal heart rhythm, muscle cramps, restless leg syndrome, fatigue and migraines (49, 50, 51)\nMore subtle, long-term symptoms that you may not notice include insulin resistance and high blood pressure.\nDietary sources of magnesium include (7):\n- Whole grains: One cup of oats (6 ounces or 170 g) contains 74% the RDI.\n- Nuts: 20 almonds provide 17% of the RDI.\n- Dark chocolate: 1 ounce (30 g) of dark chocolate (70–85%) provides 15% of the RDI.\n- Leafy, green vegetables: 1 ounce (30 g) of raw spinach provides 6% of the RDI.\nBottom Line: Many people are eating very little magnesium, and deficiency is common in Western countries. Low magnesium intake has been associated with many health conditions and diseases.\nTake Home Message\nIt is possible to be deficient in almost every nutrient, but these 7 are by far the most common.\nChildren, young women, the elderly and vegetarians seem to be at the highest risk of several deficiencies.\nThe best way to prevent a deficiency is to eat a balanced, real food-based diet that includes nutrient-dense foods (both plants and animals).\nHowever, supplements can be necessary when it is impossible to get enough from the diet alone.']	['<urn:uuid:196c23f2-2761-4d4c-9482-234281ec9146>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	9	59	2484
84	How did economic factors and printing innovations transform pottery manufacturing?	Economic changes and printing innovations revolutionized pottery manufacturing in the late 18th century. The 1784 Commutation Act reduced tea tax from 119% to 12.5%, increasing tea consumption and demand for tableware. Meanwhile, high import duties on Chinese porcelain (rising to 109% by 1790) created opportunities for domestic manufacturers. The development of transfer printing techniques, particularly by Spode, enabled mass production of affordable, decorated earthenware. This innovation allowed manufacturers to target the emerging middle class market, while the relatively low cost of printing made quality tableware accessible to more people and made many potters wealthy.	"['Transfer printed decoration on porcelain was begun in England in 1756 and was developed by John Sadler and Guy Green of Liverpool. It was then adopted by Josiah Wedgwood who used it on his ivory based ""Creamware"". Thomas Spode early introduced blue transfer printed wares, using an improved version of the method of Ralph Baddeley in Shelton.\nThe printing method greatly reduced the effort required to produce large numbers of the same pattern. The relatively low cost of printing allowed more people to purchase quality tableware and its popularity made many potters wealthy. Most of the transfer ware manufactured in England came out of the Staffordshire region.\nFrom 1773 the East India Company had begun to reduce their imports of chinaware, making it difficult for families to obtain replacements and additions.\nIn 1784, the enormous tax in England on tea, was dramatically reduced which significantly increasing the frequency and enjoyment of tea drinking, which in turn, increased the demand for tea services and pots. The same year, in 1784, to meet this demand for more porcelain decorated in the classical Chinese decorations, Josiah Spode I perfected the process of blue underglaze printing on earthenware, from hand-engraved copper plates.\nInitially, the patterns were reproductions of the Chinese porcelain designs, firmly establishing the popularity of blue and white themes, but others soon followed, including the earliest blue florals. This not only assured Spodes fame and the future prosperity of his company, but was essential to the phenomenal growth of the English tableware industry.\nThe Spode transfer printing process was almost identical with the printing of a fine etching and was done from copper plates in which the design had been deeply engraved by hand. Dot punching was used for softer shadings and provided tones over large areas.\nAfter the engraving was done color mixed with oil was worked into the depths of the engraving. This was done on a stove that kept the copper plate hot, so that the color would run more freely. Colour was rubbed into the engraving with a wooden ""dabber"". When the engraving was filled, the surface was carefully scraped clean, leaving the color only in the engraved lines and the punched dots. After the excess colour had been removed the copper plate was bossed to even eliminate the thin film that was left by the scraper.\nTo catch the decoration onto a softer media a sheet of strong tissue paper, ""sized"" with soft soap and water, was laid smoothly on the copper engraving, which was then run under the roller of an etching press. The roller was covered with a soft felt to force the paper into contact with every line and dot of the pattern.\nThe engraving was then put back on the hot stove and the printed tissue paper was pulled away from the engraving. When the tissue was lifted it would draw with it all of the color from the engraving and the design would now be on the tissue. Next the the separate parts of the printed decoration that would be needed for the piece to be decorated, would now be cut-out out of the sheet of paper.\nThe Transferrer, who were mostly skillful girls, would now place the pieces of printed tissue carefully into position on the ware, where they would be held stuck to the porcelain by the tackiness of the colour. The print would be vigorously rubbed down with a stiff-bristled brush, lubricated with soft soap. Finally, to remove the tissue, is would now be washed off with cold water. When the tissue was washed off, it would leave the design on the ware.\nThe decorated ware would now be fired for ten hours at between 680C and 750C in the ""hardening-on"" kiln, so that the oil from the color would evaporate and the decoration would be fixed to the ware. After hardening-on, the ware could be glazed and re-fired at 1050C, which is also when the design would turn blue.\nThree original patterns from the period 1790 to 1820 - Blue Italian, Tower Blue and Willow - are still produced at Spode today. The method of transfer printing was introduced by the Maastricht potteries around 1840 with copper plates engraved in England. In Japan a similar method using transfer patterns was introduced by the late 19th century called Inbante.\nOn Chinese porcelain transfer prints seems to have been introduced even later and most Chinese porcelain pieces which appears to have been transfer printed seems to date to the first decades of the 20th century. The method seems to have been abandoned before WWII.', ""The Willow Pottery Pattern: These Lovers Flew Away\nThe success of the Willow pattern in the nineteenth century, the vast quantities in which C19th pieces survive and the enduring popularity of the design which continues in production today - it might be all too easy to consider the design as of little merit or interest. But this would be to dismiss the significance of the pattern's history, its origins rooted in its time and place, and the innovation and ingenuity of the astute business acumen in the Staffordshire potteries.\nThe circularity of the relationship between design and mass production is possibly nowhere better illustrated than in the success of the Willow pattern for the thriving nineteenth century pottery industry. The invention of transfer printing in the eighteenth century enabled unprecedented expansion, initially drawing almost exclusively on the influences of the designs on the Chinese porcelain, imported in vast quantities into England during the 1700s.\nThis rapid growth of the imported Chinese wares was directly linked to the expanding horizons of the East India Company, which established a regular passage to China from Europe via the Cape of Good Hope to India. After a long layover in Canton, the ships were loaded with cargo, including the precious tea, for the return passage. Heavy seas were regularly encountered on the return voyage and the hulls took in water. A cargo was needed which could be stowed in the lowest section of the hulls without deterioration. Porcelain was an ideal cargo for this purpose and the wares were packed in specially made boxes, stacked to form a platform on which the other more vulnerable goods could be stowed. Officers of the company were also permitted to make use of this space for their own enterprises, the amount of space being allocated according to rank.1 On arrival back in England, the Chinese blue painted porcelains met a ready and voracious market throughout the first half of the C18th.\nThe domestic porcelains also acquired their own niche corner of the market alongside the Chinese wares and, for a time, both the imported and home-grown wares seemed to enjoy an almost certain co-existence. However, by the 1770s several factors combined to depress both the imported Chinese and the predominance of porcelain altogether. The potteries had felt the effect of war in the Americas, with the interruption in the export trade serving to further dampen the markets for porcelain in particular, already under severe pressure from increasing domestic competition and its effect on prices for economic production. America also began to trade for itself directly with Canton.\nThe porcelain manufacturers experienced practical problems in production of the larger dinner plates and were in any case losing ground to the prevailing fashionable taste for the pearlware and creamwares. Josiah Wedgwood's persistence in his trials to perfect his creamware body was triumphantly rewarded in 1765 by Queen Charlotte's commission of a large service and the bestowal on Wedgwood of the right to name his new ceramic Queensware. The elegance of the wares which could be produced perfectly matched the Neo-Classical style, at the height of fashion at a time of the work of the designers such as Adam and Sheraton and became the preferred choice of the wealthy and aristocratic households.\nDemand was fueled by the aspirational taste of the newly monied merchants and industrialists, keen to emulate their more patrician neighbours. Although eighteenth century English society was one of clear social divide, it was far removed from the rigid structure in other countries, such as at the French court at that time. The landed gentry, for example, would leave their estates for frequent visits to London, where they mingled freely with the highest levels of society and would observe the customs and trappings of the Georgian court. The industrial revolution brought unprecedented economic growth, creating a new merchant class and the increased wealth of this emergent middle stratum was reflected by the surge in demand for goods to reflect their enhanced status and aspirations. Fashionable taste favoured the creamwares for the dinner table, and porcelains wares for tea and dessert services, and the merchant classes followed fashion. However, fashionable the wares may have been, but the market was nevertheless limited, chiefly by affordability and there was a finite capacity for repeat orders.\nUnder the severe constraints being experienced, the focus of many manufacturers turned to volume. The solution to the challenge of bringing dinner, dessert and tea wares, which would be both affordable and fashionable to the previously untapped potential of the lower middle and working class market, came with the invention of, and advances in, transfer printed decoration.\nTrade in porcelains from China began a sharp decline with the imposition of onerous import duties, which were to rise from 47% to 109% and above by 1790. While the import duties were escalating, added incentive for the domestic market came with the Commutation Act of 1784, at a stroke reducing the tax on tea from 119% to 12.5% - overnight, the profit in the trade in smuggled tea disappeared and the East India company maximised the opportunity to boost its trade in imported tea at the expense of the porcelain wares.\nThe opportunities thus presented, both by the loss of the imported porcelain and the new market occasioned by the expanding merchant classes, coincided with the developments in printed decoration. Although blue printing underglaze was still in its infancy when it was in use at Worcester on its porcelains in the 1750s, the technique spread to other porcelain factories. The domestic Blue and white porcelains, decorated in the Chinoiserie style, fed a lucrative and fashionable market.\nHowever, fashion should not be considered synonymous here with popularity, price and affordability inevitably restricts expansion; these wares were still predominantly targeted at wealthier patrons. Josiah Spode identified the possibilities offered by the niche market for less expensive tableware in a sophisticated style. His refinements and improvements to the underglaze blue printing process meant that by the 1785 the Spode factory was producing its first blue and white printed earthenwares. The fashionable creamwares were unsuited for blue printing, having the unsatisfactory effect of rendering the cream ground a dingy hue, combined with consequent loss of sparkle to the blue, but earthenware (and pearlware) provided the perfect 'canvas.' The cleaner ground and blue patterning were in harmonious complement, the pearlware glaze enhancing the blue, rather like old-fashioned laundry blue might be used to 'make your whites whiter'!\nFrom its very beginnings, Spode's printed wares exhibited a skilled and polished degree of artistry, thanks in great part to the work of the engraver Thomas Lucas. Both Lucas and his apprentice Thomas Minton, who was to move to Staffordshire and also work for Spode for a brief period a few years later, had worked under Thomas Turner at the Caughley works in Shropshire. Lucas undoubtedly brought with him to Spode the skills in printing acquired during his time at Caughley. Spode would already have been closely familiar with the Chinese designs from the matchings produced by the factory and the first Spode underglaze blue printed earthenware pattern produced was the Mandarin, copied from the Chinese. Mandarin and Broseley were seminal in the history of the Willow pattern, which incorporated a combination of various recurring elements, among them the willow tree, the fence, the bridge and figures, and the pagoda teahouse.\nTurner had produced the first printed Broseley pattern on porcelain c1780. Probably engraved by Minton, it was a direct copy from the Chinese but named after a neighbouring Shropshire town. Spode's version of Caughley's Broseley used the title Two Temples II. The Mandarin pattern derived from the Chinese Two Birds pattern. Both contain the essential elements which are combined and re-arranged in the composition for the Willow pattern, which appeared in 1790. Minton possibly had some hand in the engraving of the plate for Turner's version of the Mandarin, certainly he would have been aware of it from his time apprenticed there under Lucas. The Caughley version is faithful to the original Mandarin and although now known as Willow Nankin, this is a C20th nomenclature and the name does not appear in the factory records. Mandarin or Nankin, both feature elements which will recur in the Willow pattern but are very different from the famous pattern which was to become so familiar – and seemingly ubiquitous.\nSpode's design, incorporating the familiar elements within an original composition not found in the Chinese wares, evolved through several versions. The first copper plate in 1790 was entirely line engraved whereas areas of stipple punch engraving are seen by the time of the engraving for Willow Third version.\nThe Willow patterned wares were to prove a success, quickly copied and produced by other factories, so much so that by 1824 a salesman's order specified any pattern but 'must be blue willow.' So specific a reference to 'willow,' but so general in other details, underlines how the design at that time carried no association with any romantic tales – the story with which the pattern has become inextricably tied was to come a few years later, when all the essential elements were woven into a Victorian melodrama, published in The Family Friend in 1849. The pagoda with the orange tree behind, the willow tree hanging over the three figures crossing the bridge, the fence in the foreground, the boat, the island and the two birds: all were drawn together in a work of fictional flummery which nevertheless caught the public imagination, raveling the tale into the pattern – an association which has endured through the following hundred years. The height of its popularity may be gauged by the eccentric Sir George Sitwell's suggestion that his cattle be stenciled in the blue willow pattern!\nUnderstanding the origins of the design, however, explains the disparity between the high drama of the tale it ostensibly recounts and the cool, rather dispassionate air of the figures on the bridge. The third figure, the angry mandarin in the tale, trots gently in the rear, holding a fishing rod, resembling a yoyo. The second figure carries a scroll ( a less than vital accessory for a girl fleeing a fate worse than death), although those of an irreverent frame of mind might believe it more closely resembles a surfboard tucked under the arm. The trio make an orderly progress over the bridge, in the manner of society members on their way to a meeting convened on the other side of the river, each in silent contemplation of the second item on the agenda. Certainly there is a marked absence of any sense of the urgency advisable for lovers escaping the wrath of an irate father.\nWillow was copied by numerous factories and identification as to maker is not always straightforward, not only on account of similarities in the engravings, but an impressed maker's mark will not always be the factory which printed the decoration and sold the ware. It was not uncommon for a factory to purchase in blanks, often to complete a large order. The border and nankin itself can be useful guides for confirming a factory and small differences in the pattern can be helpful also, but not invariably, since makers might adapt their pattern for different shapes and sized wares. It is therefore unsafe to reply for attribution on small differences in detail, such as the numbers of oranges on the tree.\nThe Willow is the epitome of European chinoiserie, a fantasy version of China which might be all too tempting to ridicule from a jaded C20th perspective, were it not redeemed by its innate and rather innocent charm. The dogged determination of the eighteenth century potters, their persistence in trials and experiments which eventually bore fruit in the invention and successful development of underglaze printing techniques, and the new ceramics and glazes to enhance the results, brought remarkable innovation which reinvigorated the pottery industry.\nAny contempt bred from familiarity with this most famous of patterns should therefore be considered in the context of the time and place, leavened by the history of its origins. Remove the rather silly story from the equation and the pattern can be seen as a clever and successful re-interpretation within a well-balanced composition. The enduring appeal of this design has survived and thrived, and no collection of blue and white transferware can be considered complete if it does not include at least one substantial piece of Willow Pattern.\nThese Lovers Flew Away\nTrembling with fear, the young girl pressed closer into the protective circle of Chang's arms, as the thunderous battering against the door echoed around the inside of the gardener's cottage in which the young lovers had sought refuge. The terrible knowledge of the dreadful fate which awaited them both, if they failed to make their escape, rendered them momentarily frozen into inaction.\nA Mandarin, grown fat and rich from bribes in his duties as a customs officer for the Emperor, planned an alliance between his beautiful young daughter and an old but wealthy aristocrat. On discovering his daughter was in love with his secretary, Chang, the son of a poor fisherman, the Mandarin flew into a rage and locked Koong-se inside a small house, surrounded by a fence to prevent the lovers from continuing their association. As is the way with all romances, at least in fiction, love finds a way and the lovers met in secret to make their plans – on the day appointed, they began their escape, sheltering in a gardener's cottage temporarily until their absence was discovered.\nRecovering his wits, Chang leads Koong-seout through a back door and they cautiously make their way across the bridge, but are spotted by the Mandarin who gives chase.

85	I work with both monitors and printers daily, and I'm wondering how the color reproduction capabilities compare between these two technologies - which one can display a broader range of colors?	Monitors and printers use different technologies for reproducing color and have vastly different gamuts. RGB, used in monitors, produces a larger gamut (color range) than CMYK used in printers. Interestingly, while there are colors that monitors can produce that printers cannot, the reverse is also true - printers can produce some colors that monitors cannot display. This is illustrated by how a luster profile on a P900 printer can produce colors that extend beyond an AdobeRGB gamut, even though high-end monitors like the Eizo 2700S can hit approximately 99% of the AdobeRGB space.

As such they have vastly different gamuts. Attached is an illustration of a luster profile on a P900 poking out of an AdobeRGB gamut. (The Eizo 2700S can hit approximately 99% of the AdobeRGB space.) There are colors the monitor can produce that the printer cannot – and surprisingly it is true the other way around also.Re: Weird Color Cast with Spectraview IIReply #1 on: October 8, 2021 at 6:36 pm\nThat is kinda old for a colorimeter. They usually have plastic filters that get brittle over time.\nBut really, the first thing to do is try the calibration again. Sometimes weird things happen with computer and instruments.Re: Basic Color vs. Other Profiling SoftwareReply #2 on: August 9, 2021 at 1:03 pm\nThe control of the panel that Andrew was referring to can best be thought of as a built-in graphics card. These high end monitors, especially those with an extended gamut, make use of built-in graphic processing that is better than what’s built into the computer – so that you get 1024 points of “adjustment” of color – a more precise adjustment than what is available with most 8-bit graphics cards (256) that are in your computer. Each manufacturer (NEC, Eizo) makes available its own software that can calibrate while talking to this built-in graphics card. You obviously don’t want to calibrate these high end monitors without using software that will work with these advanced graphic processors. basICColor Display is an independent software which supports many of these displays. It might not support every NEC or every Eizo – so do check to see if your model is supported.Re: XRite, iMac, BenQ: Calibration issueReply #3 on: June 17, 2021 at 6:22 pmMy, it sounds like you are doing everything right. Here are a few ideas off the top of my head that you could look into:– The different backlit technologies could affect the way the instrument measures the white. If the iMac is consistently too bright, choose a lower luminance to calibrate it to, like 80 cd/m2 and calibrate only the iMac to that. See if this makes a difference. You would probably have to open up a blank white page on both displays to visually compare them to see which setting gets your iMac to where you want it.– When calibrating monitors we preferably like to have them roughly set up mechanically before we ask the software to step in and fine-tune the color. I’m not sure if your iMac has a way to consistently reduce the backlight of the display before calibration?– Does the i1Profiler ADC feature (Automatic Display Control) interact with the iMac? (I’m not sure if it does or not.) Are you using that? If it works, it would take over the job of interacting with the hardware to control the display backlight.Re: What Does a Printer Profile Actually Do?Reply #4 on: May 18, 2020 at 2:03 pm\nI am drooling with color geek envy! That Kodak Custom Color Tools plug-in was amazingly simple and effective. But, yeah. We would not really have that much use for it these days.', 'Using the correct color mode in your design is essential to getting your message across. Learn the distinctions between RGB and CMYK color profiles with this simple overview.\nCover image via Rostislav_Sedlacek.\nThere can be a lot of confusion behind RGB and CMYK color modes. If you’re a designer, it’s crucial to differentiate the color profiles since designing in the wrong mode can affect the tone and message of your document. In this article, we’ll decipher the characteristics of each profile and when to use RGB and CMYK in your designs.\nThe RGB color profile consists of Red, Green, and Blue hues that combine to create extensive variations of colors. This color mode exists exclusively in screen displays, such as in computer monitors, mobile, and television screens. Even though RGB is present across all electronic devices, the color elements vary across systems and models. An image you see on an iMac may display differently than the same image on a Dell desktop computer.\nInstead of utilizing ink to produce hues, the RGB profile partakes in additive processes to produce color by blending light. This is the exact opposite of subtractive color processes, such as mixing paints or dyes. The presence of all RGB primaries at full intensity yields white, while the absence of color produces black. When you turn a monitor or screen off, you see an absence of RGB color, resulting in black. The color displays on your screen result from the presence of those RGB base hues.\nIn Adobe Illustrator, you can see how mixing RGB primaries at different intensities can vary the color output. When isolated, the primary hues generate vibrant shades. Red and green combine to yield yellow, green and blue mix to create cyan, and blue and red produce magenta.\nRGB produces a large array of colors; this color profile features a larger gamut, or color range, than CMYK. Above, you can see how Illustrator provides a gamut warning for RGB colors that can’t be successfully translated into CMYK. This occurs when an RGB color exists outside of CMYK printing abilities. Instead, the color will convert to a CMYK equivalent, which could affect the tones of your design. When printing a design produced in RGB color profiles, the print output will be different from the online preview.\nWhen to Use RGB Color Mode\nTo avoid color profile complications, always set a document in RGB when designing for social media, digital design, or online advertisements. Set any design or image that will exist on a screen or monitor as RGB. If you design in CMYK for an online-only design, you’ll limit your color options due to CMYK’s limited gamut range.\nThe CMYK color profile contains Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (Black) that combine to produce a range of hues. This four-color process works for any type of printer. When zoomed in on printed images you can see the four-color dots that layer to create different hues and gradations. Dots per inch result from printing and involve the CMYK color profiles. Although all printers produce prints in CMYK, the end result may vary among different styles and models of printers.\nIn RGB color spaces, all primaries combine to produce white with additive color processing. CMYK modes combine with subtractive color processes, meaning all primaries mask to yield to a blackish hue. This process is similar to when you mixed paints and dyes as a kid to make that unsightly dark color. As inks and dyes are layered upon each other, they subtract from the white of the paper.\nNotice how the CMYK sliders differ from the RGB sliders. Zero intensity of all primaries produces black in RGB color profiles; in CMYK color profiles, the absence of color produces white. Cyan and magenta create a blue, magenta and yellow create red, and yellow and cyan produce green. The combination of cyan, magenta, and yellow develop an off-black shade. Key, or black, comes in to add shades to each primary due to the primaries’ inability to combine and create black.\nWhen to Use CMYK Color Mode\nReserve CMYK for printed designs. Set products such as business cards, flyers, posters, and packaging in the CMYK color profile, and do yourself and the print shop a favor by always setting your document to CMYK before exporting or printing. Doing so prevents unbalanced colors that can result from RGB colors translated into CMYK equivalents.\nChanging Color Modes in Creative Cloud\nMost Adobe Creative Cloud programs will default to RGB color modes. You can easily adjust modes in the New Document panel under the Color Mode dropdown, or within the program itself. Not all programs support RGB to CMYK conversions, but with Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign, you can switch in just one click.\nIn Adobe Illustrator, you can switch colors modes by navigating to File > Document Color Mode > RGB Color or CMYK Color. This will affect the output of your vector shapes when shifting between color modes.\nWithin Photoshop, you can change color profiles by going to Image > Mode > CMYK or RGB Color.\nNavigate to the Color Panel within the software. If the panel isn’t visible, hit F6 to bring it up. Hit the dropdown symbol and select CMYK or RGB.\nLooking to expand your knowledge on essential design terminology?

86	As an expert in ancient Buddhist art, I'm curious about what makes the Amitabha statue at Ngô Xá Pagoda such a significant representation of Lý Dynasty sculpture?	The Amitabha statue at Ngô Xá Pagoda is considered the oldest and most complete stone statue of the Việt people from the Lý Dynasty. The statue, which stands 2.16 meters tall including its pedestal, features intricate decorations typical of the Lý period, including water waves, dragons, and flowers on its three-level stone pedestal. The lowest level shows dragons flying between daisy flower strings, the middle level features lions playing with jade balls on inverted lotus, and the top level has lotus petals carved with pairs of dragons. According to historians Trần Lâm Biền and Chu Quang Trứ, this statue best represents Buddhist human sculpture during the Lý Dynasty. It was declared a National Treasure in 2013.	['|Piece of history: The original statue of the Việt people from 900 years ago. — VNS Photo Phạm Hoàng Văn|\nTo many first-time visitors, Hà Nội seems to be a young city not only because of so many young people out on its streets, but also because of new buildings and supermarkets, shops and restaurants, colleges and libraries. Thousands of new buildings have sprung up in the past 20 to 30 years.\nMany people, particularly expatriates, find it hard to look into the 1,000-year-old history to find traces of the many dynasties that had their capitals up and down the Red River.\nThe architectural landmarks of distant dynasties, such as the Lý and Trần, are few and far between. So when a stone statue of Amitabha, the future Buddha, was declared a National Treasure, people jumped at the chance to see it.\nThe statue, which is housed at Ngô Xá Pagoda in Nam Định Province, is “said to be the oldest remaining complete stone statue of the Việt people from the Lý Dynasty”, said history professor Trần Lâm Biền.\n“We found it in the 1960s when we went to examine a collection of Chương Sơn relics,” he said. “The statue was originally up in the mountains, but people had carried it down to preserve it at the Ngô Xá Pagoda at the foot of the mountain.”\nThe Lý Dynasty started with founder Lý Công Uẩn, who later became King Lý Thái Tổ, who moved the royal capital from mountain-trapped Hoa Lư, to the flatland surrounding Đại La Citadel, where the Red River meets a busy residential and trading centre.\nHe named the new citadel Thăng Long, the Ascending Dragon, and started a dynasty that lasted for more than 200 years, that was militarily powerful and economically successful. Religion and art also bloomed.\n|First phase: The original stone Amitabha Statue before it was gold-gilded. Photo courtesy of http://hoidonghuongnamdinhhcm.com|\nLý Công Uẩn grew up in a pagoda. During his life, Lý Thái Tổ, as he was known, was an observant Buddhist. Buddhism flourished under the dynasty.\nIt was written in the Đại Việt Sử Ký Toàn Thư, the Complete History of Great Việt, that the king ordered thousands of Buddhas be chiselled, thousands painted and tens of thousands of religious banners made.\nIt is written on a stone stele at Quỳnh Lâm Pagoda in Quảng Ninh Province, that a monk, Thượng Đức, carved a Buddhist statue 1m80 tall.\nAuthor Nguyễn Tiến Cảnh writes in The Arts of Lý Dynasty published in 1973, “Buddhist towers and pagodas played a vital role under the Lý Dynasty. Then, pagodas were built everywhere in the country. Where there was man, there was pagoda. At beautiful scenic mountains and landscapes, there would be a pagoda built.”\nOther Lý kings, Lý Thái Tông and Lý Nhân Tông, both took care of Buddhist and State affairs. Buddhism was actively practised, the teachings were wide-spread. Historian Lê Văn Hưu in the 13th century wrote that, “Over half of the population are monks and pagodas can be seen everywhere.”\n|Still standing: Old and rusty, the pagoda was built in the 17th century. — VNS Photo Mỹ Hà|\nUnder the Lý Dynasty, a great number of pagodas and towers were built. Regent Queen Ỷ Lan built a total of 100 pagodas in her lifetime.\nThe country’s most influential Buddhist landmarks were built in the period. They included One Pillar Pagoda, the Celestial Tower in Thăng Long (now Hà nội), Phật Tích Pagoda and tower in Bắc Ninh Province and Chương Sơn Tower in Hà Nam Province.\nThe glorious epoch of the Lý Dynasty was later followed by the illustrious Trần Dynasty, both pivotal to the Việt civilization.\nIn the 15th century, the Ming from China invaded Đại Việt, as then Việt Nam today was named, and placed it under Chinese rule for 20 years. During this time they destroyed all the important landmarks of the Việt people.\nThey literally pulled down the towers and pagodas, destroyed statues and pavilions. They also burnt all the books.\nOf all the magnificent pagodas and towers, palaces and residence, only five statues of Amitabha, the original treasures of the Lý Dynasty, remain for us to see today.\n|Ancient motif: The Lotus petal bears a pair of dragons typical of Lý Dynasty. — VNS Photo Mỹ Hà|\nAnd of all these five statues, the one at Ngô Xá Pagoda is the most complete. It was listed as a National Treasure in 2013.\n“This is the most important statue, the Amitabha,” says historian Trần Lâm Biền. “It is the oldest. It’s unique.”\nThis year marks the 900th anniversary of the completion of the Chương Sơn Tower and we went to observe the statue, now preserved in the Ngô Xá Pagoda at the foot of Chương Sơn Mountains.\nStarted in the early days of spring 1108, the tower took nine years to complete.\nKing Lý Nhân Tông visited the Chương Sơn mountains in 1107, 1114 and 1117 — and each time a dragon is said to have appeared. According to Đại Việt Sử Ký Tòan Thư, or the Complete History of Great Việt Complete, “King Lý Nhân Tông ventured to Chương Sơn Mountains to inaugurate the Sacred Tower Vạn Phong Thành Thiện.”\nDuring his reign, King Lý Nhân Tông warded off northern invaders and pacified southern neighbours. He reinforced the royal exams to choose talented scholars for royal postings. He banned the killing of buffaloes for meat to maintain farming capacity for rice cultivation. He built nine towers including twin towers with white tops in front of the Diên Hựu or One Pillar Pagoda in Hà Nội now.\nBut today, only the square stone foundation remains of the original Chương Sơn Pagoda. One side measures 19m long.\nThe Amitabha statue was originally placed in a 100-compartment pagoda standing by the tower. The statue was taken downhill from the mountains and now rests in Ngô Xá Pagoda, which was built in the 17th century.\nLocated at the foot of the mountains and further out of the town centre, Ngô Xá Pagoda is quiet and solemn. It stands in a large yard under age-old trees facing a rice field.\nThe sitting statue at Ngô Xá rests on a three-level stone pedestal. The lowest level shows water waves, dragons and flowers. The lower half of this level shows water wave after wave, above which lively dragons fly in between daisy flower strings. These motifs are quite popular and typical of the decoration in the Lý Dynasty.\nThe next level features a pair of lions playing with a jade ball on top of an inverted lotus. The lions sport little flowers on their bodies. The lotus petals are carved with chrysanthemum flowers.\nThe top level features a lotus bed with two layers of petals. Each petal bears a pair of dragons beautifully and lively carved.\nAll the ornate decorations lead to the most important statue on top. The whole statue and pedestal stand at 2m16.\nThe statue had a removable headpiece but it was stolen from the pagoda in 2002.\nA country-wide police search was announced and all border gates checked. Nearly a yearly later, the head was found wrapped in a red piece of cloth, left in the commune’s cemetery.\nNow if you visit the pagoda, you’ll see the statue clad in gold.\nNguyễn Văn Vinh, 80, a long time guard at the pagoda explained that the gilded coat was to hide the cut at the throat of the statue.\nIn a paper about Buddhism during the Lý Dynasty, historians Trần Lâm Biền and Chu Quang Trứ wrote that, “Only the statue at Ngô Xá Pagoda best represents the Buddhist human sculpture during the Lý Dynasty.”\nThe same paper also has it that, “The 100-compartment pagoda was beautifully carved\nwith wood, but it was all gone.”\nPointing to a broken piece with water wave motifs, Nguyễn Văn Vinh says, “This is what is left of the border of the western hall at the 100-compartment pagoda up in the mountain.”\nHe then sighs, “It was huge.” — VNS\nBy Nguyễn Mỹ Hà\n|Carved creatures: An image of lions playing with a jade ball, a popular image in the Lý Dynasty, not seen in later dynasties. — VNS Photo Phạm Hoàng Văn|\n|Historic artifact: The Stone pedestal, the most complete to date from the Lý Dynasty. — VNS Photo Phạm Hòang Văn|']	['<urn:uuid:0b5c7937-d5db-40c8-b803-4bd898888454>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	27	116	1398
87	How long do solar power batteries typically last?	Good deep-cycle batteries can be expected to last between 5 to 15 years, and sometimes more. However, the lifespan depends heavily on maintenance and usage. Cheap batteries might cause problems in half that time. To maximize battery life, they should be brought to a full state of charge every 3 weeks, protected from temperature extremes (as they lose 25% capacity at 30°F), and should not be discharged too deeply. The ideal depth of discharge is around 50%, though they can technically go up to 80% discharge. Additionally, having multiple parallel battery strings should be avoided as this can lead to accelerated failure.	['Deep Cycle Batteries: How to Keep Them Alive for Years and Years\nLead-acid deep cycle batteries are often considered to be the “weak link” in renewable energy systems. However, today’s renewable energy batteries are better than ever, and so are the devices that regulate and protect them. Battery failures are rarely the fault of the batteries themselves! Follow these guidelines to avoid the vast majority of all battery problems.\nSizing Battery Banks\nA battery bank should be sized (as a minimum) to a capacity of 5 days of load. Energy use in most home power systems increases over time, so consider sizing larger than that. Why? After 1 year of service, it is NOT advisable to enlarge a battery bank by adding new batteries to it, because batteries’ voltage response changes with age. Stray currents flow, causing losses and failure to equalize.\nBuy high-quality batteries selected for your needs. You get what you pay for! Good deep-cycle batteries can be expected to last for 5 to 15 years, and sometimes more. Cheap batteries can give you trouble in half that time. Read our cost comparison of lead-acid and lithium batteries for more info.\nAvoid multiple parallel strings\nThe ideal battery bank is the simplest, consisting of a single series of cells that are sized for the job. Higher capacity batteries tend to have thicker plates, and therefore greater longevity. Having fewer cells will reduce the chance of randomly occurring defects, and reduces maintenance. Suppose for example, that you require a 700 Amp-Hour bank. You can approximate that by using 3 parallel strings of golf-cart batteries (220 AH), or 2 strings of the larger L-16 style batteries (350 AH) or a single string of larger, industrial batteries.\nUnder no circumstances is it advisable to install more than three parallel battery strings. The resulting bank will tend to lose its equalization, resulting in accelerated failure of any weak cells. Weak cells will be difficult to detect because they will “steal” from the surrounding cells, and the system will suffer as a whole and will cost you more in the long run.\nHere are some precautions to take when wiring two or more strings of batteries in series-parallel. The goal is to maintain all of the cells at an equal state of charge. Cells that tend to receive less charge are likely to fail prematurely. This can take years off of the effective life of the battery bank. A fraction of an ohm of added resistance in one battery string can reduce the life of the entire string.\nStep one: Connect the two main cables to opposite corners of the battery bank, and maintain symmetry in wire size and lengths. This will help to distribute current evenly through the bank.\nStep two: Arrange batteries to maintain even temperature distribution throughout the bank. Avoid uneven exposure to heat sources. Leave at least 1/2 inch of air space around each battery, to promote even cooling.\nStep three: Apply a finish charge at least every 3 weeks (bring every cell to 100% charge).\nIn flooded battery installations, corrosion of terminals and cables is an ugly nuisance that causes resistance and potential hazards. Once corrosion gets hold, it is hard to stop. The good news — it is easy to prevent! Apply a non-hardening sealant to all of the metal parts of the terminals before assembly. Completely coat the battery terminals, the wire lugs, and the nuts and bolts individually. A sealant applied after assembly will not reach all around every junction. Voids will remain, acid spatter will enter, and corrosion will begin as soon as your installation is finished.\nSpecial compounds are sold to protect terminals, but you can have perfectly good results using common petroleum jelly (Vaseline). It will not inhibit electrical contact. Apply a thin coating with your fingers, and it won’t look sloppy. If wire is exposed at a terminal lug, it should be sealed airtight, using either adhesive-lined heat-shrink tubing or submersible rubber splice tape. You can also seal an end of stranded wire by warming it gently, and dipping it in the petroleum jelly to liquefy, and wick it into the wire.\nIt also helps to put the batteries over a floor drain, or in a space without a floor, so that they can be rinsed with water easily. Washing the battery tops (about twice per year) will remove accumulated moisture (acid spatter) and dust. This will further reduce corrosion, and will prevent stray currents from stealing energy. Batteries that we have protected by these measures show very little corrosion, even after 10 years without terminal cleaning.\nModerate the temperature\nBatteries lose approximately 25% of their capacity at a temperature of 30°F (compared to a baseline of 77°F). At higher temperatures, they deteriorate faster. Thus, it is desirable to protect them from temperature extremes. If no thermally-stable structure is available, consider an earth-sheltered enclosure. Where low temperature cannot be avoided, get a larger battery bank to make up for the loss of capacity in the winter. Avoid direct radiant heat sources that will cause some batteries to get warmer than others.\nUse temperature compensation\nWhen batteries are cold, they require an increase in the charge voltage limit, in order to reach full charge. When they are warm, they require a reduction in the voltage limit in order to prevent overcharge. Temperature compensation is a feature in many charge controllers and power centers, as well as in the back-up chargers in some inverters. To use this feature, order the accessory temperature probe for each charging device, and attach it to any one of the batteries.\nUse low-voltage disconnects\nDischarging a battery to exhaustion will cause immediate, irreversible loss of capacity and life expectancy. Your system should employ low voltage disconnect (LVD) in the load circuits. Most dc to ac power inverters have this feature, and so do many charge controllers and power centers. Don’t depend on human behavior to prevent over-discharge. It can be caused easily by accident or by an irresponsible user. Again, most inverters have LVD built-in but if there are DC loads on the system, please incorporate an LVD device.\nBring batteries to a full state-of-charge every 3 weeks\nBring the batteries to a full state-of-charge (SOC) at least every 3 weeks. This reduces internal corrosion and degradation, and helps to insure equalization, so that any weaker cells do not fall continually farther behind. A full SOC may occur naturally during most of the year, but do not hesitate to run a generator when necessary, to bring the batteries up. Information like this should be posted at the power center. For more details, refer to the instructions for the inverter/charger and for the batteries.\nHow do you know when a battery is 100% charged?\nThe “charged” indicator on most PV charge controllers means only that battery voltage is relatively high. The SOC may be approaching full, but is not necessarily near 100% A voltmeter reading gets you closer, but it is not a certain indicator. It varies too much with current flow, temperature and time, to give a clear indication.\nInstall a System Monitor\nWould you drive a car with no dashboard? Metering is not just “bells and whistles”. It is necessary to help you to read the status of the system. Many charge controllers have indicator lights and readouts built-in. For a full-scale remote home, consider the addition of a digital monitor, like Trace TM-500, Tri-Metric, E-Meter or Omni-Meter. These devices monitor voltage and current, record amp-hours, and accurately display the state-of-charge of the battery bank. They also record more detailed information that can be useful for troubleshooting. The monitor may be mounted in another room or building, for handy viewing.\nHow to read a Hydrometer\nA hydrometer will help you to determine whether the battery bank is getting fully charged, and whether any individual cells are falling behind. You should be aware that a hydrometer will give you false readings under the following conditions.\nAfter adding water: For pure water to mix throughout the cell, it takes time and some bubbling during finish charge. A hydrometer will show a greatly reduced reading until the fluid mixes.\nLow temperature: As battery temperature drops, the fluid becomes more dense. A temperature compensating hydrometer is best. Otherwise, for every 10°F below 70°F, subtract 3.5 points from the reading.\nTime lag during recharge: As the battery recharges, the fluid becomes more dense down between the plates. The hydrometer reads the fluid above the plates. You will get a delayed reading until the fluid is mixed by the movement of bubbles during finish charge. The voltage will rise steadily, providing an indication that something is happening.\nDuring discharge, you will get a true hydrometer reading because the fluid becomes less dense and will circulate to the top. Any time a hydrometer indicates a fully charged cell, you know it is fully charged.\nWarning: battery acid is hazardous. When working around batteries, wear safety glasses. Get a rugged plastic bottle to keep with your service tools, and fill it with a sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and water. Use it to neutralize accidental splash or spills and to clean normal acid spatter from battery tops. Finally, don’t wear your favorite blue jeans!\nJust add water\nNote: This applies only to “flooded batteries”, not to “sealed batteries”.\nThe plates of every cell in your battery bank must be submerged at all times. Never add any fluid to a battery except distilled water, deionized water, or very clean rainwater collected in plastic containers. Most batteries require addition of water every 6 to 12 months. There is no need to fill them more frequently than needed to submerge the plates. Fill them only to the level recommended by the manufacturer, generally about an inch below the top, otherwise they may overflow during finish-charging.\nDeep cycle batteries are the heart of your power system. They may demand your attention occasionally, but your relationship with them need not be a struggle.

We’ll also answer any questions you might have about your system. 1-800-472-1142', 'There are some ways to sort out battery type, in this article I will sort out two main types of batteries that are popular. These are classified by the structure and applications, with their own advantages and disadvantages.\n*** The Li-Polyme and Li-Ion Batteries are using in solar power too. However, their price are high so they are not popular.\nBatteries are classified by the structure, we have two main types of batteries are:\n- Flooded Lead Acid batteries (FLA) and\n- Sealed Valve-Regulated Lead-Acid batteries (VRLA).\nFlooded Lead Acid batteries (FLA):\nFLA batteries are the most commonly used batteries. FLA batteries require periodic topping up with electrolyte so that we call it is “Wet” or “Flooded”. This is the traditional technology that having been used for decades.\nThe word “flooded” is used because these types of batteries contain an excess of electrolyte fluid so that the plates are completely flooded. The level of electrolyte should be above the tops of plates which serve as a reservoir to make sure that water loss during charging does not lower the level below the plate tops and cause damage.\nThey usually have the long life and the lowest cost per amp-hour of any another choice. The cons are that they do require regular maintenance as add watering, equalizing charges and keeping the terminals clean. They produce more combustible gases when charging too so we need put them in airy place.\nSealed Valve-Regulated Lead-Acid batteries (VRLA):\nVRLA batteries are more commonly known as “sealed batteries”. In fact, they are called valve-regulated is more suitable than “sealed” because VRLA batteries are fitted with a pressure vent that allows surplus gas to be vented when the internal gas pressure builds up.\nVRLA batteries were designed to eliminate the need for water addition and to provide batteries that could be used in any position.\nThe cost of VRLA batteries is higher than FLA batteries and because of their “sealed” construction, VRLA batteries are considered “maintenance free” and require no addition of electrolyte or water to the cells.\nVRLA batteries types are commonly classified as:\n- Absorbed glass mat (AGM) batteries – has the electrolyte absorbed in a fiber-glass mat separator.\n- Gel batteries – “gel cell” – has the electrolyte mixed with silica dust to form an immobilized gel.\nBatteries are classified by the applications, we have two main types:\n- Starting (Shallow-Cycle) Batteries and\n- Deep-Cycle Batteries.\nWith all of FLA and VRLA batteries types which was classified above, they also has classified as deep cycle and shallow cycle batteries.\nStarting (Shallow-Cycle) Batteries:\n- Sometimes called SLI (Starting Lighting and Ignition) battery for starting, lighting, ignition batteries that having short or “shallow” depth of discharge.\n- Because the battery plates designed for have a large surface area (the thin sponge-like plates lead structure) for instant chemical reactions. It’s mean that they are designed to produce a very high starting current in a very short time.\n- These batteries are not recommended for use in solar power system because they would quickly be ruined by the deep cycles required for extended use.\n- These batteries type will generally fail after 30-150 deep cycles while they may last for thousands of cycles in normal starting use (2-5% discharge).\n- The starting battery is designed to start the vehicle engine.\n- The main difference between the best deep cycle batteries and starting batteries are the battery plates are SOLID thick lead plates – not sponge-like lead as of starting batteries. This gives less surface area, thus less “instant” power like starting batteries.\n- Deep-cycle batteries are designed to be large discharged down to 80% capacity of battery but the best long life-span is to keep the average cycle at about 50% discharge.\n- The deep-cycle batteries are made to provide stable continuous power.\nWhich battery type is best and most efficient battery for solar panels power?\nAs above mention, starting (shallow-cycle) batteries types are designed to deliver short and high-current for only starting the engine. They are designed to discharge only a very small (2% – 5%) part of their capacity too.\nSo the best and most efficient battery for solar panels power is deep-cycle battery types. Deep cycle batteries are designed with larger plates and different chemistry to avoid the corrosive effect of frequently using the full capacity. They are designed to discharge deeply (up to 80%), using most of its capacity.\nBelow is a comparison table that will let you know about the best as well as affordable batteries which is Most Efficient Batteries for Best Solar Panels Power for many years.\nHow to choose the best battery for your solar power system?\nNow, you known that the best batteries for your solar panels power are deep-cycle batteries types. Below I’ll write details for it.\nWhat is a Best Deep Cycle Battery?\nBest deep-cycle batteries types are designed for regularly depth of discharge that using most of its capacity.\nWhat is depth of discharge (DoD)?\nDoD is a measure of battery capacity which is used to describe how deeply the battery is discharged.\n- If a battery is 100% fully charged, it means this battery has 0% DoD.\n- If a battery has delivered 30% of its capacity, here are 70% energy reserved, it means the DOD of this battery is 30%\n- If a battery is 100% empty, the DOD of this battery is 100%\nDoD always can be known as how much energy that the battery delivered. For deep-cycle batteries types, do not fully discharge them to 100% DOD, it would shorten the cycle life of batteries. Highly recommend for discharge is 50% DoD.\nThe Differences between Deep-cycle Flooded (FLA) and Deep-cycle Valve-Regulated Lead-acid (VRLA) Batteries for best solar panels power:\nChoosing the best batteries types for your solar panels power system is important. That why understand the main differences between deep-cycle flooded (FLA), and Deep-cycle Valve-Regulated Lead-Acid (VRLA) Batteries is essential. With the VRLA type will be subdivided into two types, Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) and Gel Batteries.\nDeep-Cycle Flooded Lead-Acid Batteries (FLA):\nDeep-cycle flooded lead-acid batteries are very versatile and should be the first choice for renewable energy systems where maintenance can be carried out and ventilation is available.\nThe pros of using deep-cycle flooded batteries:\n- Lower cost than deep-cycle VRLA batteries.\n- Longer deep-cycle lifespan than deep-cycle VRLA batteries.\n- Simple maintenance by addition of distilled water.\n- High discharge rate capability.\n- Good Performance in hot climates. (>90 oF)\n- More available worldwide.\n- Operation better then deep-cycle VRLA batteries when regularly in a partial state of charge.\n- Long, proven history of use.\nThe cons of using deep-cycle flooded batteries are:\n- Period of adding distilled water is must have.\n- Can only be used in an up-right position.\n- Produce gas (oxygen and hydrogen) when charged.\n- May emit acid spray if overcharging.\n- Require ventilation.\n- Higher self-discharging rate than deep-cycle VRLA batteries.\n- Cannot be used in the near areas of electrical equipment or anything highly flammable.\nAbsorbed Glass Mat (AGM) Batteries:\nAGM (Absorbed Glass Mat) is the safest and best option. They require very little or no maintenance. There is no need for ventilation and they will not spill.\nThe pros of using deep-cycle AGM batteries:\n- Cheaper than deep-cycle Gel batteries.\n- Temperature range for operating is wider than deep-cycle Gel or FLA batteries.\n- Slowest self-discharge rate than FLA, AGM and Gel batteries.\n- Best shock/vibration resistance than FLA, AGM and Gel batteries.\n- Best for high power applications than FLA, AGM and Gel batteries.\nThe cons of using deep-cycle AGM batteries:\n- Don’t perform as well as deep-cycle FLA or Gel batteries for systems that require regular deep discharge. (i.e. 80% DoD)\n- Do not operate as well as deep-cycle Gel batteries in low power applications.\nGel batteries are generally superior to AGM in recovery from deep discharge because they contain more electrolytes and are less susceptible to stratification than either flooded or AGM batteries. The gel electrolyte has a higher resistivity than fluid electrolyte therefore Gel batteries have lower high rate charge and discharge capability than AGM and flooded types.\nThe pros of using deep-cycle Gel batteries:\n- Operation better than deep-cycle AGM batteries for systems that require regular deep discharge. (i.e. 80% DoD)\n- Perform better than deep-cycle AGM batteries for low power applications.\nThe cons of using deep-cycle Gel batteries:\n- More expensive than deep-cycle FLA and AGM batteries types.\n- Do not perform as well as deep-cycle FLA or AGM batteries in cold temperatures. (< 40 oF)\n- Do not perform as well as deep-cycle FLA or AGM batteries when they regularly reach a shallow depth of discharge. (i.e. 20% DoD)\n- Higher self-discharge rate than deep-cycle AGM batteries.\nThe Best and Most Efficient Batteries for Best Solar Panels Power are deep cycle batteries types that are designed with larger plates and different chemistry to avoid the corrosive-effect of frequently using the full its capacity. They are designed to be regularly deeply discharged using most of its capacity.']	['<urn:uuid:9b597aea-d29f-4e58-87da-e91064825e3b>', '<urn:uuid:5d46f3bb-1289-4dc2-9fe9-4b9be3beebfb>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	8	102	3231
88	what existing drug can help treat emphysema	Using computational approaches to search databases of drugs, researchers have identified an existing drug as a potential emphysema therapeutic. This drug has been validated to reverse aspects of the emphysema gene expression signature and molecular defects in tissue remodeling pathways.	['Our focus is on translational research to better understand lung biology and disease using post-genomic technologies and computational tools. The long terms goals of our lab are two fold. On the one hand, we seek to leverage these approaches to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of lung disease. On the other hand, we seek to develop and apply new research approaches and to train physician-scientists and graduate students who can apply these tools in the setting of translational research.\nThe sequencing of the human genome, together with the technological advances that enabled this accomplishment, have ushered in a new era of biomedical research and profoundly altered the culture of science. We now have the ability to profile the properties of a biological sample in incredible detail, and this has led to an explosion of data from which we can now glean important new aspects of normal and disease biology: leading to new strategies for disease treatment and prevention; as well as new strategies for disease diagnosis, risk assessment and personalized medicine. The post-genomic era has not only shifted the research paradigm from studies of single genes or pathways to large-scale studies that combine data mining of genome-wide datasets for hypothesis generation followed by experimental work to validate these hypotheses , but has also highlighted a key role for bioinformatics: the application of techniques from computer science and statistics to identify and make sense of interesting patterns in the ever-more complex datasets produced by genome-wide profiling technologies.\nOur lab consists of molecular biologists, clinicians, and computational scientists working together to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of lung disease. Our various research programs are united by a variety of themes. One unifying theme is our use of comprehensive genome-wide gene-expression profiling (“transcriptome profiling”) to discover distinctions between disease states that provide us not only with clues as to how disease develops, but also provides sensitive and specific tools for disease detection. Second, much of our research utilizes the concept of an “airway-wide field of injury” that results from toxic exposures such as cigarette smoking, or lung diseases such as lung cancer. The field of injury concept very simply posits that these types of abnormalities affect the entire respiratory tract and that responses to these insults can be detected in readily collected samples from the bronchus, nose or mouth (Figure 1). Our demonstrated ability to measure disease processes in these types of samples not only makes it possible to study responses to disease and environmental insults in large number of individuals, but also raises the possibility of being able to diagnose disease, establish disease risk, or predict response to therapy using biomarkers measured in these types of specimens.\nSelected Ongoing Research Projects\nUsing the field of injury our research focuses on:\nThe physiologic response to tobacco smoke. As many of our research goals are aimed at improving the treatment of patients with smoking-related lung diseases, we are interested in understanding how the body responds to tobacco smoke, and using this to better understand how tobacco smoke exposure contributes to disease. Using genomic approaches, we have identified smoking-related gene expression changes that occur throughout the respiratory tract and identified a subset that remain altered in people who have quit smoking. These irreversibly changed genes are especially interesting since disease risk remains elevated after smoking cessation. That many of the gene expression changes deep in the airway are also altered in cells that line the nose and mouth has led us to explore whether we can combine a simple upper airway test together with genome-wide approaches to answer basic questions such as: how physiologic responses to tobacco smoke vary amongst people who are exposed to different levels of tobacco smoke (or people who are only exposed to second-hand smoke), if differences in responses between individuals might contribute to differing levels of disease susceptibility, and if other inhaled pollutants cause similar differences in gene expression. This work is supported by grants from the NIEHS.\nDetecting lung cancer. Using genomic approaches that allow us to comprehensively identify gene expression differences, we have identified a number of differences between smokers who have lung cancer and others who were thought to potentially have lung cancer but turn out instead to have a benign disease. We detect these expression differences in normal-looking cells from the large airway that are collected during bronchoscopy: a routine clinical procedure that is often employed as an early step in figuring out whether someone has lung cancer. We have shown that we can use a combination of several such genes as a biomarker that is both sensitive and specific for distinguishing smokers with lung cancer from those with benign disease and that this biomarker is more sensitive than the standard workup done as part of the routine bronchoscopy procedure. This biomarker has been licensed to an molecular diagnostic company (Allegro Diagnostics) that is seeking to validate its performance and make it available for clinicians to use as an adjunct to bronchoscopy. We are now determining whether these cancer-specific signals can also be detected in samples from the nose and whether there are gene expression differences that occur prior to the development of clinically detectable cancer in the hope that such differences could be used as a biomarker for assessing lung cancer risk. Lung cancer risk assessment could be used to determine which current and former smokers might benefit from increased lung cancer screening, or those who are good candidates for drugs that might prevent lung cancer. We are also exploring how this airway “field of injury” reflects alterations in oncogenic pathways that can be used to guide personalized genomic approaches to chemoprevention in high-risk smokers. This work is supported by grants from the NCI/EDRN and the Department of Defense.\nMolecular classification and biomarkers for COPD and emphysema. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and emphysema are debilitating smoking-related lung diseases that often develop over an extended period and can have a remarkably different presentation and course between different patients. Using very similar approaches as our work in smoking and lung cancer, we have begun to identify gene expression differences that occur in the airway in patients with COPD and emphysema. Interestingly, the COPD-related gene-expression differences in the larger airways that we’ve studied are similar to the differences that occur in the small airways and alveolae: the tissues that are thought to be the main sites of disease. Moreover, these gene expression differences are more severe in patients with more severe disease and are diminished following treatment with anti-COPD therapy. These studies open the possibility of being able to molecularly dissect the clinical differences between patients with COPD using airway tissue readily obtained during bronchoscopy, and to develop biomarkers for monitoring a patient’s response to therapy. This work is supported by grants from the NHLBI.\nMechanisms of lung disease pathogenesis. In addition to developing biomarkers for assessing lung disease in clinical samples, we are also interested in using genome-wide approaches to improve our molecular understanding of lung disease pathogenesis. One strategy that we have used to model disease progression in both emphysema and lung cancer is to perform gene-expression profiling on multiple tissues from the same patient collected from regions of differing disease severity. Using this approach we have identified specific molecular processes involved in tissue remodeling that are specifically altered in regions of more severe emphysema. By combining these data with computational approaches to search databases of drugs, we have identified an existing drug as a potential emphysema therapeutic and validated that this drug reverses aspects of the emphysema gene expression signature and molecular defects in tissue remodeling pathways. We are also using this approach to explore the early molecular alterations that occur with progression of lung premalignancy.\nA second approach has involved identifying microRNA expression differences associated with disease. While we are exploring using microRNA (miRNA) expression differences as the basis for biomarkers similar to our gene (mRNA) expression biomarkers, the regulatory function of miRNA makes them especially attractive for understanding the regulation of disease processes. The majority of our miRNA profiling work has been performed using high throughput RNA sequencing technology that has allowed us to develop a comprehensive portrait of all the small RNA that are expressed both in airway and lung tissue and discover a number of new miRNA. We have identified specific miRNA that are important regulators of the response to smoking as well as other miRNA that contribute to airway epithelial cell differentiation and repress aspects of lung carcinogenesis.\nA third approach to understanding disease pathogenesis has involved the use of high throughput RNA sequencing to provide a comprehensive genome-wide view of the lung transcriptome at single nucleotide resolution. We are mining these data to identify disease-associated differences in transcript structure, expression of non-coding RNAs, etc. in the hope that they could serve as biomarkers, but more importantly that they might also provide specific clues as to the regulation of processes that contribute to disease pathogenesis.\nOur work on the molecular regulation of the response to smoking and lung disease pathogenesis is supported by grants from the NIEHS, NHLBI and the Department of Defense.\nDeveloping a Molecular Data Repository for the Lung Disease Research Community. This project, funded through The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), will establish the Lung Genomics Research Consortium (LGRC), a collaboration between Drs. David Schwartz (National Jewish Health), Naftali Kaminski (University of Pittsburgh), John Quackenbush (Dana-Farber cancer Institute), Marc Geraci (University of Colorado), Frank Sciurba (University of Pittsburgh), Ivana Yang (National Jewish Health) and Avrum Spira (Boston University). The goals of this project are to combine genetic, genomic and clinical information on greater than 400 human lung tissue samples from patients with various lung diseases (i.e. Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), & Emphysema).\nTranscriptome profiling via RNA-seq (next-generation sequencing using Illumina HiSeq technology)\nAvrum Spira, MD, MSc; Computational Biomedicine\nMarc Lenburg, PhD; Computational Biomedicine\nGang Liu, PhD; Computational Biomedicine\nKatrina Steiling, MD, MSc; Computational Biomedicine\nJennifer Beane, PhD; Computational Biomedicine\nAdam Gower, PhD; Computational Biomedicine\nJoshua Campbell, PhD; Computational Biomedicine\nVijaya Kolachalama, PhD, Computational Biomedicine\nJerome Brody, MD; The Pulmonary Center\nFrank Schembri, MD; The Pulmonary Center\nPaola Sebastiani, PhD; School of Public Health\nDaniel Brooks, MPH, DSc; School of Public Health\nGeorge O’Connor, MD, MS; The Pulmonary Center\nYuriy Alekseyev, PhD; Microarray Resource Center\nMichael Platt, MD; Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery|\nEhab Billatos, MD; The Pulmonary Center\nGrant Duclos; Molecular & Translational Medicine Program\nSean Corbett; Bioinformatics Program\nJiarui Zhang; Molecular & Translational Medicine Program\nXingyi Shi; Bioinformatics Program\nKe Xu; MD/PhD Program\nDonna Gibson; Administrator\nJessica Vick; Operations Manager\nSherry (Xiaohui) Zhang; Senior Research Technician\nHanqiao Liu; Senior Research Technician\nHuiqing Si; Research Technician\nBrianna Freeman; Administrative Coordinator\nDenise Fine; Clinical Research Coordinator\nYusuke Koga; Computational Analyst\nElizabeth Moses; PhD; Scientific Program Manager\nJoseph Perez-Rogers; Bioinformatics Program\nAna Brandusa Pavel; Bioinformatics Program\nJake Kantrowitz; Molecular & Translational Medicine MD/PhD Program\nGregory Radin, MD; The Pulmonary Center\nMatt Nitzberg, MD; The Pulmonary Center\nAnna Tassinari, PhD; Computational Biomedicine\nCollaborators (outside of BU medical center)\nJames Collins, PhD; College of Engineering, BU\nSteven Chillirud, PhD; Columbia University\nDavid Schwartz, MD; National Jewish Health\nIvana Yang, PhD; National Jewish Health\nNaftali Kaminski, MD; University of Pittsburgh\nFrank Sciurba, MD; University of Pittsburgh\nMatthew Meyerson, MD, PhD; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute\nJohn Quackenbush, PhD; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute\nMark Geraci, MD; University of Colorado\nJames Hogg, MD; University of British Colombia\nStephen Lam, MD; University of British Colombia\nAndrea Bild, PhD; University of Utah\nPierre Massion, MD; Vanderbilt University\nSteven Dubinett, MD; University of California, Los Angles\nDavid Elashoff, PhD; University of California, Los Angles\nDenise Aberle, MD; University of California, Los Angles\nSteven Belinsky, PhD; Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute\nDirkje Postma, MD, PhD; Groningen University, Netherlands\nMaarten van den Berge, MD; Gronigen University, Netherlands\nPhil Hansbro, PhD, University of Newcastle, Australia\n- Wang, T.W., R.C.H.

89	I'm designing nutrition plans for endurance athletes and would like to know what's the optimal timing and ratio for protein-carb intake during the post-race recovery phase, plus how quickly this needs to be consumed for maximum effectiveness?	For optimal post-race recovery, athletes should consume a 1:4 ratio of protein-to-carbohydrate within 45 minutes after finishing. This timing is crucial because after two hours, the body's ability to replenish muscle glycogen stores and repair muscle breakdown decreases by 50%. For those focused on muscle building, consume at least 30 grams of protein and 30-35 grams of carbohydrates within the first 15 minutes post-exercise.	['A Beginner’s Guide to Race Day Nutrition\nRead any article about triathlon race day nutrition and it’s easy to get confused. Between carbs and protein, millilitres and grams, longer races and sprints, and conflicting research studies, there is a lot to process. Trying to weed through it all, nutrition may become even more daunting than that first open water swim.\nWe’re going to try to make it easy. Nutrition is extremely important, but it doesn’t have to be quite so complicated!\nYou’re nervous. It’s race morning and your stomach is full of butterflies… how can you possibly eat? Stick with a breakfast that you’ve eaten during training (and that has had good results!) Don’t overdo it. If you typically drink coffee or tea and it hasn’t bothered your stomach in training, don’t decide to give it up now. The caffeine boost can actually help delay fatigue and enhance performance.\nTry to finish your breakfast at least two hours before the race start to allow for digestion time. If you really can’t stomach solid food, try an easy-to-digest smoothie (though not a new recipe- nothing new on race day!) Finally, keep sipping water up to the start to stay hydrated!\nDo you need to eat while racing?\nFor training or races less than an hour, water is perfectly adequate. Even for sprint distance races, there is no real need to consume carbohydrates, but it doesn’t hurt to sip a sports drink (which contains carbs) on the bike or during the run, especially if you anticipate that your finish time will be longer than 1 ½ hours.\nFor Olympic distance or longer races, carbohydrates become more important. The reason it gets complicated is that you need to ingest enough carbohydrates and fluid without taking on so much that you upset your stomach. Ideally, around 250 carbohydrate calories per hour is a good balance, though some athletes require less. How you consume these calories is up to you, but gels and energy drinks are formulated to make calorie consumption simple while being easy on your stomach.\nTwo gels plus a few good swigs of energy drink per hour will give you the 250 calories, but be sure to supplement each gel with about 300 ml of water for additional hydration and to keep your stomach happy. A good trick is to mark your water and sports drink bottles in 300 ml increments with a bold water-proof marker. The last thing you need on race day is to have to calculate what a millilitre is!\nIf you can’t stomach gels or need a little variety, some solid food is fine, but it is important to test these during hard training sessions. You may be able to happily munch on a banana while on the bike but may find that you can only stomach gels or sports fluids while running.\nWhen should you eat?\nThe best place to start replacing calories is on the bike. Obviously, trying to eat and drink while swimming is not only difficult, but you will have enough calories from your morning meal to get you through your swim. Try sipping a little water as you transition from swim to bike to help balance your stomach. Once on your bike, allow yourself to settle a bit. Get your heart rate and breathing to a comfortable place and then start trying to replace some calories. For most people it is much easier to eat/drink on the bike than while running, so it’s important to execute your nutrition plan as much as possible on the cycling segment.\nYou can have the best nutrition plan in the world, but if you haven’t tried it before the race how do you know that it works for you? It is vital that you try the fluids, gels or foods that you plan to race with prior to race day. Experiment with the amount of calories that you take in (and how you take them) during intense training sessions to discover what you like, what you don’t and what works best for you. And remember, there’s still a chance that your body will behave differently on race day, so try to be flexible and have a back-up plan.\nWhat about protein?\nUnless you are racing in long course events (half-Ironman or longer), you can keep things simple by ingesting only carbohydrate energy.\nWhen protein does become very important is post-race (or post-workout) recovery. There is a relatively small window that is optimal to replenish depleted muscles- ideally, less than 45 minutes.\nTo put it technically, you should be eating a 1:4 ratio protein-to-carbohydrate meal to start your muscles on the road to recovery. Since the healthiest foods don’t come with a nutrition label spelling out protein-carb ratios, a good bet is rice or a baked potato with protein (beans, chicken or tuna), toast with nut butter, or even chocolate milk. If you won’t have quick access to balanced food, try packing a recovery drink. Many are available on the market in powder form, pre-formulated to offer the perfect balance of protein and carbohydrate calories.\nWhen it comes to race day nutrition, the most important thing to remember is that everyone is different. Following a few simple guidelines and finding during training the balance that works best for you is the key to your race day best!', 'You already know how important what you eat before your workout is, but what about after? Turns out, eating the proper food after a workout is equally vital in caring for your body and building strong muscle.\nAs we’ve learned, the best thing to eat before you exercise is a combination of a complex carbohydrates and high quality protein, about 30 minutes to an hour prior to hitting the gym. And it just so happens that similar rules apply after you work out. According to the Journal of the International Society of Sports Medicine, you should attempt to eat this pairing of carbs and protein very soon after you finish your sweat session.\nDuring exercise, the body uses up its store of glycogen (which is fuel stored in your muscles) in order to power you through the workout. This leaves you with a depleted reserve of glycogen, meaning that your body will have a much more difficult time repairing your muscles and keeping the metabolism humming. But studies show that eating the carb/protein duo after your workout solves this issue.\nHow soon you eat after your workout is important as well. Aim to consume a healthy coupling of carbs and protein within at least an hour of when you finish exercising. Why? The reason has been proven time and again by scientific studies – only two hours after your workout ends, the body loses its ability to replenish muscle stores of glycogen and mend the breakdown of muscles by half. That’s right – 50%! Ideally, try to eat within the first 45 minutes after you finish your workout, when the body is the most responsive to absorbing the carbs and protein.\nTrying to build muscle quickly? Make sure to consume at least 30 grams of protein and around 30-35 grams of carbohydrates within the first 15 minutes after your training session. If your main goal is weight loss or maintenance, about 15-25 grams of protein and a similar amount of carbs should suffice, and you have a greater time window in which to consume it.\nFor a quick-to-prepare, easy-to-digest and extremely nutritious post-gym snack, try making a protein shake using a banana, one scoop of high caliber plant protein powder and eight ounces of water or almond milk (using almond milk will make the shake slightly creamier and adds calories). Other terrific options include sautéed or steamed veggies drizzled in olive oil, quinoa with black beans and spices mixed in or a walnut, beet and chickpea salad topped with a dressing made of olive oil and vinegar.\nOf course, hydration is another crucial factor. Dehydration can cause cramps, fatigue, mental fog and headaches, as well as making your muscles feel heavy and sluggish. Not only should you drink water before and during your workout, but make sure to also down a good amount of H2O afterwards to help your body rehydrate.

90	is there difference between regular dried fruit and organic dried fruit color and additives	Yes, there is a significant difference. Organic dried fruits, such as Newman's Own Organics apricots, appear darker in color (light peach to dark brown) because they do not contain sulfur dioxide, a preservative that maintains bright color after drying. Sulfur dioxide is strictly prohibited in organic food items according to USDA's National Organic Program. Organic products focus on avoiding synthetic preservatives, though they may use natural preservatives like honey, raisins, and rosemary extracts, which are available in organic form.	"['Newman\'s Own Organics - Organic Apricots - 6 oz. (170g)\nNewman\'s Own Organics Organic Apricots are part of dried fruits that have gone beyond their traditional roles and are now replacing high-fat, high-sugar snacks and drinks. Prunes, once thought of only for the older set, are being touted for their high antioxidant qualities; second only to blueberries. Raisins, always a treat, have made the leap from the lunch box and oven to trail mix, granola, and other mixed snacks. Cranberries are not just for holiday sauce anymore. They add zip to fruit salads and stuffings, are tossed into mixed snacks, are baked into muffins, breads, and cookies, or, like the others, are perfect for eating alone. Apricots are a healthy, delicious treat right out of the package. Or, try adding them to yogurt, cereal, salad, or desserts. All can be used to add a special flavor to today\'s ethnic recipes and family favorites, as well as continuing to be a staple for bakers.\nThat\'s what they kept in mind when they created their products. they focus on the kinds of products they loved as kids, but take them one step further by using the highest quality of available organic ingredients.\nThey find that people really want to know how the ingredients are grown and processed on the way to their grocer\'s shelf. When people see how much organic foods have improved since the early days of packaged \'health\' foods, they hope they\'ll try other organic food products.\nThe materials below were developed by the USDA National Organic Program in 1994 and serve as a general outline of the definition of Organic as it will be used in the United States.\nOrganic agriculture is a holistic system with the primary goal of optimizing the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life, plants, animals, and people. Management practices are carefully selected with an intent to restore and then maintain ecological harmony on the farm, its surrounding environment and ultimately the whole planetary ecosystem.\nThe Organic Farm Plan is central to demonstrating progressive improvement of practices and measuring evolution of the management system as a whole towards greater sustainability. In this context, record- keeping is a key management tool for identifying problems and successful adaptations.\nProtect the environment, minimize pollution, promote health and optimize biological productivity.\nThe primary goal of organic production systems is optimizing environmental health, human health and biological productivity. Organic producers therefore seek to reduce or eliminate reliance on practices and inputs (natural and synthetic) that may harm soil life, deplete nonrenewable resources, pose a hazard to water and air quality, or threaten the health of farmworkers or consumers.\nReplenish and maintain long-term soil fertility by providing optimal conditions for soil biological activity.\nThe health of the soil is fundamental to the health of the whole system, and may be evaluated by the extent and vitality of its biological activity. ""Feed the soil, not the plant,"" continues to be a primary tenet of ecologically sound soil management. Fertility improvement practices must balance physical, chemical and biological considerations to optimize the quantity and diversity of soil organisms. Such practices may include a combination of crop rotations, rotational grazing of livestock, cover crops, intercropping, green manures, recycling of plant and animal wastes, tillage, and judicious application of essential mineral nutrients.\nMaintain diversity within the farming system and its surroundings and protect and develop plant and wildlife habit.\nBiological diversity is a key ecological precept, essential to stability and therefore to sustainability. Diversity must be enhanced in every aspect of organic production, including the selection of inputs, crop varieties, livestock breeds, rotation cycles and pest management strategies. The principle of diversity can be similarly applied to personal skills, social interactions, and economic decisions.\nRecycle materials and resources to the greatest extent possible within the farm and its surrounding community as part of a regionally organized agricultural system.\nOrganic systems intensively manage the individual farm system and use biologically-based inputs in preference to petroleum-based inputs. Soil and plant nutrients depleted through cropping and natural leaching are replenished by nutrient sources from within the farm and the surrounding community. Energy expended in transportation, manufacturing and handling of agricultural inputs and products is minimized to the greatest extent possible.\nProvide attentive care, that meets both health and behavioral requirements of farm animals.\nFarm animals must be managed to prevent health problems through a focus on diet, housing, handling and observation. Organically produced feed, in conjunction with care and living conditions which minimize stress, is the foundation of a health promoting management system. Attentive care for the healthy animal is a fundamental precept of organic livestock management.\nMaintain the integrity and nutritional value of organic food and processed products through each step of the process from planting to consumption.\nOrganically grown food and processed products must be processed, manufactured, and handled to preserve their healthful qualities and maintain the principles of the organic management system. Ingredients, additives and processing aids used in organic processed products must be consistent with the overall principles or organic production. Consumers should be provided with the assurance that products bearing organic labels are certified organic by independent verification from seed through sale.\nDevelop and adopt new technologies with consideration for their long range social and ecological impact.\nNew practices, materials and technologies must be evaluated according to established criteria for organic production. It is assumed that organic production systems will progress toward sustainablity over time through technical innovation and social evolution.\nNewman\'s Own Organics Questions & Answers\nAre Newman’s Own Organics dried Apricots supposed to be dark in color?\nYes! Organic Apricots will be anywhere from light peach in color to light tan to dark brown. Organic apricots will always have the dark look because there is no sulfur dioxide added to preserve their bright color after the drying process. Sulfur dioxide is strictly prohibited in organic food items and they are happy to abide by that rule. Also, they recommend storing all dried fruit items in your refrigerator. This will help to maintain optimum freshness right up to the expiration date.\nIs Sulfur Dioxide added to Newman\'s Own Organics dried fruit products?\nNo, the use of Sulfur Dioxide in organic food items is expressly prohibited by the USDA\'s National Organic Program. All of Newman\'s Own Organics Organic dried fruit products are 100% USDA Organic, with no additives or preservatives.\nAre Newman\'s Own Organics dried fruit products certified kosher?\nAll of Newman\'s Own Organics dried fruit products are certified Kosher by the Orthodox Union. You will find the circle U symbol on all Newman\'s dried fruit packaging.\nAre Newman\'s Own Organics dried fruit products gluten and allergen free?\nAll of their dried fruit products are produced in a facility that is peanut, tree nut, milk, gluten, and casein free. All of their products that contain allergens are packed in a separate facility and strict procedures are in place to prevent cross contamination.\nAbout Newman\'s Own Organics\nNewman\'s Own Organics was established as a division of Newman\'s Own in 1993, and became a separate company in late 2001. The sale of Newman\'s Own Organics products generates money for the Newman\'s Own Foundation to give away. Since 1982 Paul Newman and the Newman\'s Own Foundation have donated more than $350 million dollars to educational and charitable organizations worldwide.\nNell Newman, Co-founder and Pres: Product Development and Marketing.\nPeter Meehan, Co-founder and CEO: Sales and Marketing; New Product Opportunities\nCertified organic by Oregon Tilth.

The lasting power, or shelf life, of each organic food item is another story as the avoidance of synthetic preservatives may bring challenges in achieving adequate shelf life. Fortunately, natural preservatives such as honey, raisins and rosemary extracts may come in organic form.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. organic industry has $35 billion in annual sales, and a study conducted Jan. 18-24 by the Organic Trade Association said 81% of U.S. families report they purchase organic at least sometimes.\nA good chance exists those families will check what ingredients are used as preservatives in the organic products. A report titled “Beyond natural and organic 2010” from The Hartman Group, Inc., Bellevue, Wash., showed that 66% of survey respondents thought the term organic implied or suggested no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives. A January 2012 report from Marketsandmarkets revealed the global preservative market by 2016 is estimated to be at $2,552.4 million due to a boost from growth in natural preservatives.\nHoney, an example of a natural preservative, is available in 300 varieties in the United States, said Catherine Barry, director of marketing for the National Honey Board, Firestone, Colo. Each variety has its own flavor, and each variety may be organic.\n“Honey is honey, regardless of if it is organic or not,” Ms. Barry said. “All honey has the same composition and functional ability to extend the shelf life of bakery foods and inhibit mold growth through the three main factors that help maintain crumb softness: preventing moisture transfer, delaying starch recrystallization and hydrolyzing starch.\n“Liquid honey is hygroscopic and enables products to maintain their moisture content far longer than products that use dry sweeteners. Honey, by design, does not give up its water easily.”\nOther ingredients such as starches, fibers and maltodextrins bind water and prevent moisture transfer, she said.\n“However, the amylase present in honey promotes crumb softness by effectively hydrolyzing starch, thereby contributing to moisture retention,” Ms. Barry said. “Honey’s fructose content also holds in a bakery food’s moisture, thus reducing dry products and the ingredient’s high acidity (average pH 3.91) inhibits mold growth.”\nOrganic raisins, just like regular raisins, may extend shelf life, according to the California Raisin Marketing Board, Fresno, Calif. The high water-binding capacity helps to retain moisture in bakery products, the board said. Naturally occurring organic acids, including tartaric, propionic and glutamic acids, provide such benefits as inhibiting mold growth, acting as a natural preservative and enhancing flavors.\nTwo phenolic compounds naturally present in rosemary leaves, carnosic acid and carnosol, were identified as the main oil soluble contributors to the antioxidant activity of rosemary extracts, said Baptiste Demur, business manager at Naturex, Avignon, France. Rosemary leaves also contain water-soluble rosmarinic acid, which has antioxidant properties.\nRosemary extracts may delay the development of off-flavors, rancidity and discoloration in many food and beverage products, Mr. Demur said.\n“But only those extracts that contain carnosic acid, carnosol or rosmarinic acid are able to do this,” he said.\nVitiva, Markovci, Slovenia, offers rosemary extracts with carnosic acid, carnosol and rosmarinic acid. The company said internal reports and other published literature have shown rosemary antioxidants in most applications are more effective than vitamin E (synthetic), BHA, BHT and TBHQ. Vitiva offers a range of rosemary extracts in Inolens, which have a low odor and reduced bitterness. Since these ingredients are extracted from plants, they will be more expensive than synthetic preservatives, according to Vitiva. Cost savings may be realized through economies of scale and the effectiveness of extraction processes.\nVitiva in 2009 received organic certification from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Organic Program.\nUnder European regulations, deodorized rosemary extracts standardized to carnosic acid and carnosol are listed as food antioxidants, Mr. Demur said. Organic-certified variants are approved for use as antioxidants in organic foods, he said.\n“Organic-certified rosemary extracts are a bit more expensive than conventional ones,” Mr. Demur said. “Additional quality requirements, production constraints, dedicated processes and third-party certification lead to additional costs in the manufacturing of such products. But since usage levels of rosemary extracts in foods remain very low, cost-in-use for organic rosemary extracts remains low compared to the total cost of the organic finished product.”\nIn general, establishing acceptable shelf life of organic products may mean using some of the same strategies used in establishing acceptable shelf life of conventional products.\n“The main methods that I am aware of are those that are also used by the mainstream food industry: low water activity, inert gasses, retort, aseptic and higher barrier packaging, freezing, traditional methods like smoking, salting, fermenting, antioxidants from rosemary,” said Prescott Bergh, sales and marketing director for Ciranda, Inc., Hudson, Wis. “We offer organic lecithin and some tapioca syrups that can help staling in baked goods.”']"	['<urn:uuid:113bcc17-c372-4501-a7ea-cb2e3f6e92be>', '<urn:uuid:33872c26-ce94-44f3-ab3d-b2ac92498132>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	14	79	2136
91	I have an interest in historical family businesses - could you tell me more about this mint farm's background and what they produce?	Crosby Mint Farms has been a family-owned independent producer of mint and mint products since 1912. They currently farm 300 acres, with approximately 95% of their mint growing on low land organic muck. Their main business focuses on growing, harvesting, and distilling mint to produce high-grade peppermint and spearmint oils. These oils are pure, containing no chemical additives or re-processing that might compromise their healing properties. Additionally, over the past six years, they developed a process to convert mint waste products into high-nutrient mint compost, which is all natural, biodegradable, and suitable for organic farmers and gardeners.	['- Additional Plants: herbs\n- Crop Production: windbreaks\n- Education and Training: extension\n- Natural Resources/Environment: habitat enhancement, soil stabilization, wildlife\nCrosby Mint Farms has been a family-owned independent producer of mint and mint products since 1912. We currently farm 300 acres. About 95% of this mint grows on low land organic muck. Our major focus has been to grow, harvest and distill mint to produce high grade peppermint and spearmint oils. These oils have no chemical additives or re-processing to compromise the healing properties of the oil.\nCrosby Mint Farms has developed a process over the past six years whereby our mint waste products are changed into high-nutrient mint compost. The compost is all natural, biodegradable and usable for organic farmers and gardeners. In 2003, James Crosby received the Tri- Country Waste Recycling Award and was honored as the State of Michigan Recycler of the Year.\nIn the past five years, we have suffered crop loss due to high winds and erosion. There was a natural wind break that has been damaged either by loss of trees or by nearby home development. A change in weather patterns has impacted the area. Heavy winds blow from the southwest into our valley and create a massive dust cloud traveling east and then northeast over 80 to 100 acres of our mint, taking much of our crop with it.\nIDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM\nOur low land muck soil is located in a small valley. In the spring, high winds have increased from the southwest. There has been a negative impact on our mint crops due to wind erosion. Two new crops of mint were lost to high wind and lack of moisture in the ground. The wind breaks in place were inefficient. The trees still standing were over seventy years old. There had been a loss of trees due to storms and nearby home development. There was also a considerable amount of field maintenance due to fallen limbs and branches in our mint crops.\n1. Re-establish the wind break system\n2. Plant new mint crop and be able to keep it\n3. Reduce wind erosion\n4. Add to the environment/wildlife habitat\n5. Reduce labor and fuel costs by reducing wind break maintenance\n6. Increase and promote good land stewardship\nMichigan State University Agriculture Extension conducted a class for Agriculture Watershed Extension Teachers (maintenance and erosion specialists for the Department of Agriculture). This was a two-hour field class. The area of greatest need for the wind break was determined and we then worked our way into the valley to assess impact. We determined that Blue Spruce would be a good choice because of their growth pattern. They would be fast growing, adding one foot to their height and one foot to their width per year. They are sturdy enough to withstand the storms and high winds that had caused previous damage so that our maintenance of the trees and our fields would be reduced.\nWe cleared the necessary area with a 5-yard dump truck, skid header, and 5-yard loader. The large logs were stacked and additional limbs and brush were bundled and hauled to a processing location. The entire area was cleaned and leveled in preparation for new tree plantings. This phase took 4 days.\nWe began orange flagging the placement for the new trees 15 feet apart and staggered every 7 feet to ensure a thick line of trees. We were able to plant 10 trees per day. Each tree was watered as we planted by filling the plug hose with water and placing the tree and the plug in the hole dug for it. We went around each tree to close any gaps that might expose the root systems to air. We planted the trees in the fall while they were in a dormant state. The flagging and measuring took one day. The planting took four and a half days. The watering and packing took two days. Therefore, the total project took eleven and a half days to form a 600 foot wind break.\nInformation concerning the project was disseminated via a press release in cooperation with the Michigan State University Agriculture Extension to statewide media, newspapers, and environmental publications.\nThis project was larger than anticipated due to the size of trees and many years of accumulated brush.\nWe have determined that this project will continue for 3 to 4 years to increase the wind break, provide wildlife habitat and year-round green esthetics as well as protect our fields from wind erosion.']	['<urn:uuid:45607e0a-f97e-40ae-a5ed-4aa02031b620>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	23	97	750
92	root cellar storage specialist need proper vegetable preparation storage conditions carrots beets	For root cellar storage, vegetables should be cleaned by shaking only (not washing). Carrots and beets should be packed in slightly damp sand within plastic tubs, baskets, buckets or root-storage bins. Proper ventilation, temperature and humidity must be maintained, and bins should be regularly checked for spoilage.	['Canning is practiced by grandmothers and mothers all over America. The sterilization of high heat and pressurization has made it the safe and preferred preservation of Americans for generations, but some people aren’t interested in spending hours over a stove for cupboards precariously stacked with jars of heat-compromised nutrients. And we don’t have to! We can use our garden through the winter months and it won’t require us to buy a fancy pan or convert our crawl space into an apple butter pantry.\nFermentation is an age-old practice that involves little more than salt, water and a dark corner. Everything from soy sauce and sauerkraut to kimchi and tofu is thanks to a nice long probiotic bath. It’s so simple it seems too good to be true, but there’s a reason for its popularity across the world.\nIt all starts with a community of hungry microorganisms. They feed off of sugars and, in turn, release carbon dioxide, acids and alcohols which actually act to preserve our foods. So our veggies gets a new lease on life, plus a healthy dose of microflora and a punch of complex flavor. In all, fermentation offers a tasty jar of probiotic benefits that can be used to make everything from sauerkraut to medicinal wine and probiotic lemonade.\nGet to know the basics of fermentation, then find yourself a crock pot or a good glass jar to give it a go. If you live in the right growing zone, you can put off this kitchen project until late fall, when cold-loving crops like cabbage will be at their peak.\nAcetic acid, or vinegar, is itself a product of fermentation whereby microorganisms turn sugar into alcohol and then acid. Thanks to this acidic nature, vinegar provides an environment that has food spoilers turning on their heels. Garden veggies can be kept for months, and the process can be completed in a matter of minutes. If you’re a busy gardener, then this is the option for you.\nWe generally think of condiments like pickles and relish when we think of pickled foods, but vinegar offers far more versatility. There’s a number of pickle-icious fruits and vegetables, and you can even preserve herbs with vinegar. Spices are also a welcome addition that will boost flavors while imparting their health and antiseptic properties. Whatever route you choose to go, you’ve got a tangy jar of preserved goodness that will keep bacteria at bay.\nDehydrating is my personal favorite when it comes to preservation. Dried foods are lightweight and compact, so they take minimal storage space, keep for months, and they’re highly mobile. The drying process maintains the structure of your fruits and veggies so they can easily be rehydrated and put to work, but their dried form gives them an explosive concentration of flavor that taste buds love.\nDehydration comes with another huge benefit, and that’s convenience. You can make gallon jars of dried soups, instant mashed potatoes, and even sauces that will be ready with just a cup of hot water. And you can always appease the kid in all of us with fun fruit leathers, salty veggie chips or even pies and ketchup.\nElectrical dehydrators are a worthy investment because they work whether there’s rain or shine, but this convenience does come along with a whirring fan and a bump in the electrical bill. If you live in a location with sunny days ahead, then dehydrate in true off-grid style with a solar dehydrator. You can make your own with our simple DIY project so the sun can handle the energy bill.\n4. Root cellar\nWhether you have a full root cellar, or just a cool, dry space in your home, you should be thinking storage. Root crops like carrots and onions thrive in the dark conditions of soil, many even surviving through winter, so they’re easily brought indoors. It can take some trial and error to perfect the balance between moisture and temperature, but you’ll have many pounds of crunchy veggies without any extra fridge space.\nSome crops will require curing to store long-term, as is the case with potatoes, but the storing process is simple and basic. When storing foods, you’ll want to clean them simply by shaking them (no washing!). Vegetables can then be stored in plastic tubs, baskets, buckets or root-storage bins, with carrots and beets being packed in slightly damp sand. From here you just need to maintain ventilation, temperature and humidity, and be sure to sift through bins for spoilers while you’re around.\nPreservation can be done simply, and it won’t cost you stacks of mason jars or hours over a stovetop. Figure out which approach best accommodates your space, diet and cooking considerations, and give it a try.\nDo you have tips, tricks or resources that other people should know about?

93	compare gothic themes in australian bush music modern science fiction ghost stories differences similarities	The Gothic themes manifest differently in Australian bush music and science fiction ghost stories, while sharing some key elements. In Australian bush music, the Gothic manifests through exploring colonial fears of the unknown landscape and supernatural elements, as exemplified in works that transpose traditional Gothic tropes like ghosts and spectres into Australian colonial experiences. Meanwhile, in science fiction, Gothic elements appear through the creation of monstrous beings and disturbing otherworlds that exist at the boundaries of modern knowledge. Both genres share an interest in supernatural occurrences and figures, though science fiction tends to give these a technological explanation rather than a purely supernatural one. They also both deal with anxieties of their respective presents - colonial fears in Australian Gothic, and fears about technological progress in science fiction Gothic.	"['Sheet Music: Score\nDances with devils : concerto for percussion and orchestra / Iain Grandage.\nby Iain Grandage (2015)\nThe Australian Bush - that great mythic landscape - has always held a particular grasp on the psyche of white Australians. It is the great unknown - beyond the realms of our control, and source of many subliminal fears. Indigenous Australians are more than aware of the power and mystery held within the earth, but those are not my stories to tell or my songs to sing. This work is instead a response to a series of short stories that reside within the Australian Gothic literary tradition of the 19th century, a tradition where the tropes of the old world - ghosts, spectres, haunted houses and mythological beasts, were transposed and transformed into events and situations that had particular resonance with the Australian colonial experience.\nThe opening movement of Dances with Devils revolves\naround Barbara Baynton\'s Chosen Vessel. This concise\nmasterwork tells of the terror of a young woman one twilight, who\nis dreading the return of a swagman to her isolated hut. On\nhearing a passing horse, she mistakes it for a saviour. However,\nthe passing rider is a young religious man who mistakes her for a\nghost in her flowing nightgown, with her cries of ""For Christ\'s\nSake"", and refuses to stop. She falls victim to the lurking\nswagman. The movement features the Marimba and is dominated by\ntriplet rhythms redolent of horse hooves.\nThe second movement is a subdued Sarabande, based on Edward Dyson\'s Conquering Bush, a story in which a woman, unable to cope with the searing, incessant noise of the birds around her bush home chooses a drowning death for her and her child instead. It features series of instruments being transformed in pitch and timbre by water. The third movement is a traditional scherzo, launching from a moment within Henry Lawson\'s famous story The Drover\'s Wife where the principal female character dreams of a different life, far from the bush. This is juxtaposed with harsher sections that reflect the reality of her current situation - namely staying awake all night in a bush hut, awaiting a snake\'s reappearance.\nThe final movement provides a moment of hope amongst the gothic landscape. It is a Tarantella inspired by Lola Montez, whose famed Spider Dance was the talk of the goldfields when she toured Australia in the 1850s.\nI am indebted to Claire Edwardes for all she has brought to this\ncollaboration. Claire\'s energy, virtuosity and musical competence\nredresses the seemingly impossible imbalance between a solitary\nsoloist and the massed forces of a symphony orchestra that is\ninherent within the concerto format. She stands strong against\nthat conquering noise and casts doubt and darkness aside.

The conjunction of two hybrid genres composed from diverse literary and mythical precursors breeds monstrosities: strange beings and disturbing other — and underworlds lurk at the limits of modern knowledge.\nDespite so many Gothic science fiction mutations, it is strange the genres should cross at all. Gothic writing conventionally deals in supernatural occurrences and figures, looking back, in its architectural and cultural settings, to superstitious and barbaric “dark” ages without the enlightened reason and empirical technique so important in science fiction’s imaginings of human progress.\nGothic fiction, for all its wanderings in desolate landscapes and invocations of diabolical forces, never strays far from home, playing upon the anxieties of its uncertain present. In looking forward to change, science fiction also projects figures of fear. In the crossings of two generic monsters, monstrosity returns from the past and arrives from the future. As long as it is not “predictable,” “calculable,” or “programmable,” “the future is necessarily monstrous” (Derrida 1992: 386).\nGothic fiction begins as a hybrid, a “new species” of writing combining ancient and modern romance (Walpole 1982: 9). A “strange monster,” critics considered its plots improbable, its narratives ill-formed and unrealistic, its morality dubious: “monsters of the imagination” — a deluge of tales, romances, novels threatening familial and social mores — propagated only depravity (Williams 1970: 151, 162).\nHybrid, disturbing, monstrous, Gothic fiction developed in the shadow of acceptability. Science fiction, another monster, relishes “its vitalising bastardy, its immoral interdisciplinary habits, as it feathers its nest with scraps of knowledge seized from the limit of the expanding world” (Aldiss 1973: 41).\nDisrespecting disciplines, it disobeys generic divisions to emerge from fantasy, fairy tale, myth, romance, fable, and epic (Aldiss 1973: 8–19; Parrinder 1980: 39). It is “a mode of romance with a strong inherent tendency to myth” (Frye 1973: 49). H.G. Wells described his tales as “scientific romances”; Hugo Gernsback (introducing the Amazing Stories magazine in April 1926) defined “scientifiction” as “a charming romance intermingled with scientific fact and prophetic vision” (Ketterer 1974: 50).\nMonstrous in form, romance bred monstrosities: on the one hand, idealised figures, drawn from chivalric or fairy tales, were so impossibly unrealistic as to be “monsters of perfection”; on the other hand, grotesque and deformed, its characters were “out of nature.” The creations of romance “transport the reader unprofitably into the clouds, where he is sure to find no solid footing, or into those worlds of fancy, which go forever out of the way of human paths” (Williams 1970: 162).\nRomances idealise and deform, science fiction creates “as many hells as heavens” (Nicholls 1976: 181). Romance reading is unprofitable, failing to offer proper moral instruction: its generic category lies, like science fiction, in the popular and low realms of “paraliterature” (Broderick 1995: vii). In eschewing firm ground in favour of flights of fancy, romances establish the trajectory of science fiction’s unbounded explorations of change, outsiders, escape: its “freedom of imagery” is freedom from realist conventions.\nIn this respect, science fiction liberally exploits linguistic possibilities, “the great modern literature of metaphor” (Nicholls 1976: 179–82). Metaphor, etymologically, is a form of “transport,” substituting terms, moving readers to imaginary locations, creating new associations and combinations.\nRaymond Williams, discussing the differences between utopian and science fictional treatments of paradise and hell, altered worlds and willed or technological transformations, observes that “the presentation of otherness appears to link them, as modes of desire or of warning in which a crucial emphasis is attained by the element of discontinuity from ordinary ‘realism’” (Williams 1979: 54).\nIn the eighteenth-century, monster metaphors repeatedly served to demonstrate and warn against immorality. Realism and social reality recoils from strangeness and monstrosity. In contrast, science fiction embraces metaphorical possibilities to “defamiliarise the familiar, and make familiar the new and the strange” (LeFanu 1988: 21). As a “literature of cognitive estrangement” presenting “a novum,” science fiction depends upon metaphorical creation (Suvin 1979: 4). But the “novum” is simultaneously a “monstrum,” the difference a matter of perspective. Strangeness also evokes the “uncanny,” an experience of the disruption of boundaries between reality and fantasy caused by the return of repressed psychic forces or uncertainties surrounding technical and textual mimicry of humans (Freud). In making the familiar strange, the new can be seen as a threat (monstrum) or promise (novum). Part of science fiction’s success stems from the way it has “diversified the Gothic tale of terror in such a way as to encompass those fears generated by change and technological advances which are the chief agents of change” (Aldiss 1973: 53).\nIn the 1831 introduction to ‘Frankenstein’, Mary Shelley allows her “hideous progeny” to slide from authorial control and “go forth and prosper” (Shelley 1969: 9). The monster in the text and the monster that is the text (composed of diverse generic fragments, multiple literary and cultural allusions, and different epistolary narratives) complies.\nWhile Frankenstein refuses the monster’s demand for a mate, fearing the birth of a “race of devils,” the culture that receives the novel has no such qualms: in a proliferating host of dramatic adaptations, literary reworkings, cinematic productions and popular citations, Frankenstein and monster are repeatedly invoked as synonyms for acts of uncontrolled experimentation (Easlea 1983; Turney 1998).\nThe novel begins in a ghost story competition but takes its bearings from the contemporary scientific endeavours of Erasmus Darwin, Humphrey Davy, Giovani Volta, and Luigi Galvani. It looks back and lurches forward, moving between the work of alchemists seeking the elixir vitae and the empiricism of new scientific ideas and techniques for understanding and transforming the physical world.\nGenerically, too, the novel is difficult to categories: emerging from a context of Romantic companions, aesthetics, and experiments, it abandons the supernatural events and superstitions of Gothic fiction. Geographically located in northern, Protestant, and bourgeois countries and set in the present rather than a feudal past, there is little evidence of the castles, abbeys, and ruins so central to Gothic formulas. The desolation and wildness of natural spaces in the novel offer darker reflections on the solitary figures inhabiting them, opening Romanticism to the return of Gothic horror in the “progressive internalisation and recognition of fears generated by the self ” ( Jackson 1981: 24). Self is divided, the novel becomes a psychodrama. At the same time, monstrosity is also found in external formations and institutions: in class antagonisms, revolutionary mobs, legal, social, and familial exclusions (Vlasopolos 1983).\nIndistinctly Gothic, until later revisions and interpretations firm up the association, Frankenstein is also problematically related to science fiction. One editor regards its experiments as “switched-on magic” and “souped-up alchemy”: it does not employ “the technological plausibility that is essential to science fiction” (Shelley 1974: xxvii).\nFew scientific details contribute to Frankenstein’s laborious suturing and reanimating of dead body parts, though it is made clear that the “secret of life” is taken from nature. Only belatedly, in the 1831 introduction’s discussion of electricity and its passing reference to “some powerful engine,” is there a hint of any imaginative extrapolation of current scientific discoveries (Shelley 1969: 9). The fact of scientific, rather than supernatural, creation is enough for the novel to be declared “the origin of the species,” the “first,” “unmistakable” example of modern science fiction (Aldiss 1973: 7; Priest 1979: 189; Russ 1995: 126). Frankenstein sets the pattern: “combining social criticism with new scientific ideas, while conveying a picture of her day, Mary Shelley anticipates the methods of H.G. Wells when writing his scientific romances” (Aldiss 1973: 23). It shows the “seeds of all diseased creation myths,” leading to the monstrous experiments of Dr. Moreau and the threatening robots of Karel Capek’s automated and dehumanized industrial society in R. U. R. (Aldiss 1973: 33). Frankenstein’s influence is extensive: “every robot, every android, every sentient computer (whether benevolent or malevolent), every nonbiological person . . . is a descendant of the ‘mighty figure’ Shelley dreamed one rainy night in the summer of 1816 and gave to the world two years later” (Russ 1995: 126).\nWriters frequently return to its theme and story for inspiration, to develop or correct its science, to explore further its ramifications or to pay it playful homage: Arthur C. Clarke’s “Dial ‘F’ for Frankenstein” (1965), Harry Harrison’s “At Last, The True Story of Frankenstein” (1965), Kurt Vonnegut’s “Fortitude” (1968) (see Haining 1995: 681–8, 728–34, 697–715). The origins are revisited most spectacularly in Aldiss’ Prometheus Unbound (1974) in which a modern time traveller returns to the scene of creation to meet Mary and the monster.\nIn ‘The Last Man’ (1826), Shelley confronts utopian ideas of social and political organisation with a natural disaster of global proportions. Set in the twenty-first century and adopting a visionary tone, the novel contains few modern innovations (balloon travel, a republican England). Quickly abandoning the pretence of futurity, it remains “no more than Gothic” (Aldiss 1973: 33). Its enduring impact lies in its representation of global catastrophe: a feminine and devastating plague wipes out humanity and leaves its civilisation in ruins.\nFrankenstein and ‘The Last Man’ inaugurate “two great myths of the industrial age” (Russ 1995: 126). They engage with the effects of economic, political, and scientific change on individual, familial, and social structures. Enmeshed in the uneven development of modernity, in economic shifts to commerce, industrial production, and imperial expansion, in political calls for reform and democracy, in aesthetic notions of free, imaginative individuals, and in scientific innovations rapidly and visibly transforming the conditions of human existence, the novels identify monstrosities in the new: revolutionary mobs are many-headed monsters, industrial workers are hulking brutes, new economic and political structures reduce humanity to slaves or automata. Like Gothic writing, science fiction “draws its beliefs, its material, its great organising metaphors, its very attitudes, from a culture that could not exist before the industrial revolution, before science became an autonomous activity and a way of looking at the world” (Russ 1995: 10).\nGothic and science fiction are complex and contradictory effects of modernity, bound up in the metaphors and practices with which it transforms the world.\nModernity, in inventing an array of disciplines along with economic, individual, and political liberties is a curiously doubled formation. It is, like Frankenstein, bound up with matters of production and reproduction, concerned with social and industrial developments shaping individuals, making humans, and making monsters at the same time. In this context, Frankenstein’s concern with a split or alienated self provides an appropriate metaphor to negotiate change and innovation.\nDarko Suvin, in charting the relationship between the industrial revolution and Romanticism, further divides the novel between “flawed hybrid of horror tale and philosophical SF” (Suvin 1979: 127). Where Percy Shelley is the “great poetic forerunner” of “SF anticipation,” Mary’s novel participates in a “widespread recoil from Promethean utopianism” (Suvin 1979: 124, 127). Where Frankenstein is located “in the tradition of the Gothic story,” in horror and disgust, his creature is identified as “compositional core and the real SF novum that lifts Frankenstein above the level of a grippingly mindless Gothic thriller” (Suvin 1979: 129–130).\nThe division is important, if difficult to sustain, in marking out two very different trajectories for fiction. Science fiction, “oriented towards humanity’s furthest horizons,” takes its bearings from Romantic idealism and the imagination of human progress (Suvin 1979: 170). William Godwin and Percy Shelley are exemplary figures in this line of flight: the former, a radical and humanist philosopher, imagined the rational perfectibility of social relations. Developments in technology, he optimistically speculated, in relieving want and the material hardships of labour, indicated the capacity of the mind to overcome matter. Similarly idealistic, Percy Shelley allied the benevolent and transformative potential of scientific discovery (his interests in electricity as the “spark of life” appear in Frankenstein) with poetic visions of human freedom.\nRomanticism informs many of the intellectual aspirations and aesthetic attitudes of science fiction. H.G. Wells acknowledged his place “in the tradition of Godwin and Shelley” (Wells 1966: 552). Gernsback wrote of “charming romance,” “scientific fact,” and “prophetic vision.” Isaac Asimov, in practice and criticism, associates the genre with scientific advancement, human improvement, and rational understanding (see Broderick 1995: 4).\nThe triumph of mind over matter recurs in Arthur C. Clarke’s fiction: in ‘Childhood’s End’ (1953) scientific progress has the power to save humankind and produce an “overmind.” “Naive romanticism” (Priest 1979: 189) or “transcendental mysticism” (Hollinger 1990: 34), Clarke’s “supermind,” appearing in the immense modern network of electrical, telecommunicational, and satellite relays in “Dial ‘F’ for Frankenstein,” also has malignant potential. Aesthetic attitudes and critical judgments of science fiction also evince Romanticism: opposing the vulgarity and banality of mass consumption, Aldiss is inspired by a “love of art and science” and a “rebellion against smug bourgeois society” (see Broderick 1995: 53). For Ursula Le Guin, imagination supplements reason on a journey “leading us to the freedom that is properly human” (see Broderick 1995: 76).\nMarking the boundary that allows science fiction to rise imaginatively to poetic heights or collapse in monstrous dissolution, Frankenstein makes it difficult to sever Romanticism from its darker counterpart. Both are inextricably bound together, one defining the other in a relationship of difference and reversal akin to that of creator and creature. In the novel, science is associated with visionary enthusiasm, wondrous discoveries, and miraculous knowledge (Shelley 1969: 47–8). The motivation for reanimation is framed aesthetically: Frankenstein, like Percy Shelley, is poet and experimenter. His project has benevolent and humane aims, idealistically imagining the end of disease and death.\nThough oversized, superhuman in body and strength, the creature is designed to be beautiful: it will be the first of a “new species” blessing its father-creator (Shelley 1969: 54). Borne on the wings of fantasy the project encounters its limit in horror: Frankenstein trawls through charnel houses and graveyards to steal the “secret of life” from the body of feminised nature. The creator is appalled by his animated handiwork rather than elated by technical achievement: his horror stems from aesthetic revulsion. Frankenstein’s world is overturned, beauty collapsing in horror, heaven becoming hell. His rejection, repeated by the idealised Romantic family that unwittingly educates the monster, defines monstrosity in terms of social and familial exclusion. Outcast, the monster accepts his designated destructive role.\nIdealisations, the novel suggests, readily engender monsters, figures marking the return of excluded material bodies. The two poles of existence are inseparable: imagining life beyond death, Victor’s actions only exacerbate its work. The painful education of the monster occasions some astute observations on an irreparably divided modern humanity: “was man, indeed, so powerful, so virtuous, and magnificent, yet so vicious and base?” (Shelley 1969: 119). Humans are doubled creatures, minds and bodies, individualistic and social, noble and base. The novel’s appreciation of doubleness, its attention to ideas and materialities, bodies and institutions, resonates with the constitution of modernity: the body forms a crucial object of power, a site of knowledge, discipline, normalization, and individuation constructed in a network of discursive and material practices ranging from schooling to legal and medical procedures (Foucault). The body, moreover, is crucial in establishing an imaginary sense of individual wholeness, its mirror image serving in the process of motor and psychological coordination (Lacan). Frankenstein’s fragmented, monstrous modernity, poised between the idealisations projecting a free, humanist individual and the gloomier consequences of industrial and bourgeois revolutions, has yet to integrate its individual, social, and political bodies.']"	['<urn:uuid:e293ee97-a336-4a0d-9a3f-76a0dbe9975a>', '<urn:uuid:2d8c7463-24cb-46dd-b1a4-9176e232fa93>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	14	129	3082
94	I've heard nonprofits need a board of directors - can you explain what exactly makes an organization count as a nonprofit and who needs to be involved in running it?	A nonprofit organization is defined as one organized to achieve a purpose other than generating profit. To be considered a legitimate nonprofit, several key elements are required: First, you need a board of directors - this is essential for incorporating as a nonprofit, obtaining tax exemption, and opening bank accounts. The organization must be set up for specific purposes like charitable, educational, religious, or scientific activities. While nonprofits can make a profit, that profit must go toward the organization's mission rather than benefiting private individuals. The board and leadership must maintain proper documentation including meeting minutes, bylaws, financial records, and policies. They also need to handle required government filings like annual reports and tax returns to maintain compliance.	"['Title III Regulations Revised Final Title III Regulation with Integrated Text.

In summary. and promoted increased philanthropic and nonprofit accountability.', 'By James Gilmer\nAs the end of the year approaches, it’s time to take stock of your nonprofit’s compliance requirements of the past year and also to begin planning for the year ahead. Nonprofits are held to high standards of government regulation and public oversight, so staying compliant is critical to keeping your nonprofit running smoothly.\nNonprofits are commonly required to manage multiple requirements across federal and state government agencies, and also to maintain documentation in the event of an inquiry or audit. Compliance can be generally grouped into two categories: filings that are submitted to government agencies and records that should be kept internally.\nThe following is a brief overview of the tasks that most nonprofits must complete at the end of the year. Keep in mind that not all of these items will apply to all organizations and that this list is not exhaustive.\nYour nonprofit is required to file reports periodically with the Secretary of State in which it is incorporated and any states it is qualified as a foreign corporation. The annual report updates the public records with changes to your nonprofit’s address, registered agent, and leadership each year. Report due dates vary by state, so pay attention to your state’s deadline and check if you have filed your most recent report. If your nonprofit is registered in multiple states, make sure you have adequate systems in place to track the various due dates. Failure to file periodic reports can incur steep penalties and result in your nonprofit’s registration being revoked.\nYour nonprofit is also required to maintain a registered agent in each state where it has registered to do business. If you have appointed individuals, make sure they are aware of their appointment and can reliably serve as your nonprofit’s agent. If you have appointed a registered agent service company, make sure you renew your service.\nLastly, conduct a review to see if qualification (Secretary of State registration) is necessary in any other states. Common reasons include hiring a new employee, purchasing property, opening a physical location, and as required to meet state charitable solicitation requirements.\nState Fundraising Compliance\nDepending on your state and fundraising activities, your nonprofit may be required to register with the state’s Attorney General for charitable solicitation (a.k.a. fundraising). You generally have to renew this registration annually, so make sure you have filed this year in each state. Failure to register or renew can again lead to strict penalties. Most importantly, your donors can and do search state databases to see whether your charity is legitimate.\nFundraising registration and renewal is a complex topic, and your individual requirements will vary depending on your finances and activities. For more state-specific information, you can review this Fundraising Compliance Guide. At the end of the year, review your fundraising activities, including specific initiatives and all states in which you ask for contributions. Having done so, it is possible you need to register in one or more states, or to file a renewal shortly after your fiscal year ends.\nIRS Compliance and Form 990\nEvery year, your nonprofit must file a return with the IRS, known as the “990.” There are several versions of the 990 return, and the form you file depends on your organization’s revenue. It updates the IRS with changes to your leadership, contact info, mission, activities, and finances.\nIRS Form 990 is due each year exactly four months and fifteen days after the end of your fiscal year. For nonprofits on a calendar year, this is May 15th. Failure to disclose your organization’s information in full, or failure to file at all can lead to a loss of your hard-earned federal tax exemption and/or penalties that accumulate daily. By the way, if you have incorporated in this fiscal year, and you have yet to receive your 501(c)(3) determination, you still must file IRS Form 990, or you can jeopardize becoming tax exempt from the outset.\nInternal Compliance and Recordkeeping\nIt’s important to keep thorough records of meetings, and changes to your organization, leadership, and activities. Not only will good recordkeeping help you stay organized, but it may come to your defense in the event of an audit. Your individual list will vary, but here is a brief list of items to review annually:\n- Hold annual board meeting, and keep minutes\n- Ensure bylaws are in place and up to date\n- Review all policies, including conflict of interest and executive compensation policies\n- Conduct financial performance review and reporting\n- Create and approve next year’s budget\n- Hold elections for officers and directors\nNot only does the IRS want you to keep good records, but your donors may as well. For instance, if you apply for a grant, or are trying to gain the support of a prominent donor, they may request records, including financial statements. Being able to readily produce such records help your donors to feel secure in their gift to a responsible, compliant organization.\nThe Value of Compliance\nWe’ll admit, “end of year compliance” is a bit of a misnomer. Compliance responsibilities are ongoing, from constant recordkeeping to staggered due dates of government applications and renewals, so make sure you have the right people and systems in place to manage it all. However, many of these activities coincide with preparing the 990, so the end of the year is a logical time to conduct a full review of compliance and plan for the year ahead. With a proactive approach to meeting the requirements briefly outlined in this article, your nonprofit will set itself up for success in the year ahead.\nStaying compliant adds tremendous value to your organization. Staying in good standing with the state and the IRS will avoid loss of tax exemption, and loss of limited liability protection for the officers and directors. Perhaps most importantly, donors, foundations, and other contributors want to give to responsible, credible, and fully registered organizations. By choosing to stay compliant, you make choosing your organization much easier for them!\nJames Gilmer is a compliance specialist for Harbor Compliance, which establishes 501(c) nonprofits and helps them stay compliant. Harbor Compliance assists charities in every state and several countries abroad.

95	production efficiency calculation methods cpm vs operations management optimization compare differences	Operations management and Critical Path Method (CPM) are different approaches to production optimization. Operations management focuses on strategically administering production processes and personnel to maximize output and quality while minimizing errors, through continuous re-evaluation of production setups. CPM, on the other hand, is a specific mapping technique that uses nodes to show material flow, calculating shortest and longest completion times, and identifying slack time through forward and backward pass calculations to determine the minimum project completion time.	['Operations management is the strategic administration of production processes and personnel to maximize output, minimize errors and continually enhance product quality. Facility layout refers to the way in which work stations, equipment, machinery and employees are positioned within a work facility. Process selection involves strategically choosing which types of work processes to include in the production of a product. Process selection and facility layout are both important elements of operations management. Understanding the basics of each and their correlation can help you to design more efficient production processes.\nFacility Layout Basics\nBusiness owners have a range of options to choose from when it comes to designing their facilities layouts, depending on the total size of the buildings, yards and other spaces they have to work with. Operations managers set up production facilities in such a way as to minimize the travel or holding time of semi-finished goods between different stations. Noise and air pollution can be a large factor in certain businesses -- while it may be convenient to locate a large number of work stations in a small area, you may need to spread things out to maintain a safe and healthy work environment.\nAs a simple example, consider a car wash and wax business. Washing cars in one building then driving them to an adjacent building for drying and waxing would waste time and require two buildings rather than one. Locating a dry and wax station immediately after the wash station in a single building would be a more efficient facility layout.\nEach step in a production process can be completed in a variety of ways. Consider the process of sewing a garment, for example. The key to process selection is to balance the costs, efficiency, output and quality of each option to meet your production goals. Some options may produce a higher output per hour while costing twice as much as other options, for example, while other options are less costly but produce more errors.\nA single employee could sew an entire garment, then pass it down to a packaging line; several employees could be set up next to each other, each sewing a single stitch or section before quickly passing it on, or the sewing could be handled by a machine. The finished garment could be sent off to the packaging line via an employee pushing large bins or via a conveyor belt stretching around the factory, as another example.\nChoosing the right processes and laying out processes in the most efficient manner can increase production output, decrease operational costs and enhance product quality -- the ultimate goals of operations management. Operations managers continually re-evaluate their production setups to look for opportunities to save money or boost production effectiveness.\nCritical Path Method (CPM)\nThe Critical Path Method can help you to make informed process selection and facility layout decisions. This production mapping technique uses a visual string of nodes representing individual activities to show the flow of materials in a multi-step process, while conveying a range of useful information about each activity, including its shortest and longest possible completion times, its required inputs, expected outputs and labor needs. Using CPM to map out your production processes can reveal areas of slack time, non-value-adding activities and opportunities to streamline production processes.\n- Photos.com/AbleStock.com/Getty Images', 'Critical Path Method (CPM)\nCompleting a project in time is one of the most important objectives and expectation of the stakeholders. Critical Path Method is used to prepare the optimized project schedule involving all the project activities.\nCritical Path Method helps in:\n- Determining the minimum time in which the project can be completed\n- Determining the sequence of activities which must be completed on time in order to complete the project in time\n- Determining which all tasks can be delayed without delaying the project completion time\n- Determining the Early and Late Start of tasks\n- Tracking project progress with regards to agreed timeline and taking proactive corrective action if the project seems to be getting delayed\nOnline PMP certification helps managers understand the critical path method better.\nThe typical steps involved to develop a project schedule using CPM method are as below:\n- Identify the activities for all the work packages from the project’s Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)\n- Sequence all the activities by identifying all the dependencies between the activities.\n- Develop a Schedule Network Diagram involving all the project activities ensuring that each activity has at least one predecessor and one successor except the first activity which will not have a predecessor and last activity which will not have a successor.\n- Estimating the duration of each activity in the schedule network diagram.\n- Carrying out the process of “Forward Pass” where in the “Early Start” (ES) and “Early Finish” (EF) for each activity are calculated starting from the beginning of the network diagram.\n- Carrying out the process of “Backward Pass” where in the “Late Finish” (LF) and “Late Start” (LS) for each activity are calculated starting from the end (Finish) of the network diagram.\n- Identifying the “Path” which has the longest duration in the Network Diagram. The longest path will also have the ES and LS and EF and LF of all the activities as same.\n- The longest path is termed as the “Critical Path”. The duration of this path will determine the shortest time taken to complete the project. Any delay on this path delays the project completion time. Hence they are critical from project’s schedule constraint point of view.\n- The “Non-Critical-Path” path duration will be shorter than the “Critical Path” and hence those paths will have flexibility to delay the start of the tasks on them.\n- The amount of time a task can be delayed on a “non-critical path” is known as “float” or “slack”, which is calculated by taking the difference between “LS-ES” or “LF-EF”.\n- The float on critical path will be Zero to start with and not-critical paths will have a positive float time.\n- There may be more than one critical path in a network. But having more than one critical path increases the risk of falling behind the schedule as there are more number of tasks which if they get delayed, the project will get delayed.\nAn example of Critical Path analysis is as below:\nIn the above diagram, the path with longest duration is Start-D-E-F-G-End is the critical path with duration of 17. The other 2 non-critical paths Start-A-B-C-G-End has duration of 10 and hence has a slack or float of 7 and other non-critical path Start-D-H-I-End has a duration of 11 and has a float of 6 days.\nCritical Path once identified, the team can further explore if the duration of the critical path can be compressed if the need be. Techniques such as crashing (applying more resources on critical path) or Fast Tracking (doing tasks in parallel) are applied. Compressing the critical path helps in compressing the overall project duration, thereby helping to meet the required deadline.']	['<urn:uuid:9630d4e8-0795-4c10-bdc6-c2e589a3fb00>', '<urn:uuid:d2074b7f-086d-49f4-809a-61f1decac305>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	11	77	1165
96	Could you explain how vegetation in cities affects temperature, air quality, and energy consumption in urban environments?	Vegetation in cities has multiple beneficial effects. For temperature control, trees and green infrastructure can reduce urban heat islands by shading building surfaces, deflecting solar radiation, and releasing moisture into the atmosphere. This is significant as urban heat islands can be 10-15°F warmer than surrounding areas. Regarding air quality, vegetation helps reduce ground-level ozone (smog) and filters particulate pollution, which can cause respiratory problems. Trees and parks can absorb and filter particulate matter, while also reducing air temperatures and power plant emissions associated with air conditioning. For energy consumption, by reducing local temperatures and shading building surfaces, green infrastructure decreases cooling and heating demand for buildings, leading to reduced energy needs and decreased emissions from power plants.	['Green infrastructure is a cost-effective and resilient approach to our water infrastructure needs that provides many community benefits.\nWater Quality and Quantity\nWater Quality: Stormwater from urban areas delivers many pollutants to our streams, lakes, and beaches - including pathogens, nutrients, sediment, and heavy metals. In cities with combined sewer systems, high stormwater flows can also send untreated sewage into our waters. By retaining rainfall from small storms, green infrastructure reduces stormwater discharges. Lower discharge volumes translate into reduced combined sewer overflows and lower pollutant loads. Green infrastructure also treats stormwater that is not retained.\nFlooding: Conventional stormwater infrastructure quickly drains stormwater to rivers and streams, increasing peak flows and flood risk. Green infrastructure can mitigate flood risk by slowing and reducing stormwater discharges.\nWater supply: Rainwater harvesting and infiltration-based practices increase the efficiency of our water supply system. Water collected in rainwater harvesting systems can be used for outdoor irrigation and some indoor uses and can significantly reduce municipal water use. Water infiltrated into the soil can recharge groundwater, an important source of water in the United States.\nPrivate and Public Cost Savings: When stormwater management systems are based on green infrastructure rather than gray infrastructure, developers often experience lower capital costs. These savings derive from lower costs for site grading, paving, and landscaping, and smaller or eliminated piping and detention facilities. In cities with combined sewer systems, green infrastructure controls may cost less than conventional controls, and green-gray approaches can reduce public expenditures on stormwater infrastructure.\nGround Level Ozone: Ground level ozone or smog, is created when nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) interact in the presence of heat and sunlight. Smog conditions are usually worst in the summer and can lead to respiratory health problems. Vegetation can reduce ground level ozone by reducing air temperatures, reducing power plant emissions associated with air conditioning, and removing air pollutants.\nParticulate Pollution: Particulate matter refers to the tiny bits of dust, chemicals, and metals suspended in the air we breathe. Because particulate matter is so small, it can enter into the lungs and cause serious health effects. Trees, parks, and other green infrastructure features can reduce particulate pollution by absorbing and filtering particulate matter.\nHealth Effects: Breathing ground level ozone and particulate pollution can cause respiratory ailments including chest pain, coughing, aggravation of asthma, and even premature death. In their triple bottom line study on the benefits of green infrastructure, the City of Philadelphia found that increased tree canopy would reduce ozone and particulate pollution levels enough to significantly reduce mortality, hospital admissions, and work loss days.\nEnergy and Climate Change\nUrban Heat Island: Urban heat islands form as cities replace natural land cover with dense concentrations of pavement, buildings, and other surfaces that absorb and retain heat. Trees, green roofs, and other green infrastructure features can cool urban areas by shading building surfaces, deflecting radiation from the sun, and releasing moisture into the atmosphere.\nEnergy Use: By reducing local temperatures and shading building surfaces, green infrastructure lessens the cooling and heating demand for buildings, reducing energy needs and decreasing emissions from power plants.\nClimate Change: As different parts of the country become drier, wetter, or hotter, green infrastructure can help communities adapt to climate change by increasing the capacity of drainage systems to handle large storms, increasing the resilience of water supply systems in times of drought, and mitigating the urban heat island effect. Urban vegetation can also mitigate climate change by reducing the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nWater/Energy Nexus: Treating and moving drinking water and wastewater takes a lot of energy. By reducing stormwater inflow into sewer systems, recharging aquifers, and conserving water, green infrastructure can significantly reduce energy use.\nHabitat and Wildlife\nHabitat Improvement: Vegetation in the urban environment provides habitat for birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and insects. Even small patches of vegetation such as green roofs can provide habitat for a variety of insects and birds. By reducing erosion and sedimentation, green infrastructure also improves habitat in small streams and washes.\nHabitat Connectivity: Large scale green infrastructure, such as parks and urban forests, also help to facilitate wildlife movement and connect wildlife populations between habitats. Learn how Loxahatchee, Florida is protecting the local watershed and conserving native ecosystems through the Loxahatchee Regional Greenways System.\nGreen jobs: Green infrastructure can reduce a community’s infrastructure costs, promote economic growth, and create construction and maintenance jobs. As demand for green infrastructure skills increases, a range of new training and certification programs has emerged.\nHealth Benefits: More green space and parks encourages outdoor physical activity, reducing obesity and preventing associated chronic diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, Type II diabetes, arthritis, and certain kinds of cancer.\nRecreation space: Green infrastructure’s vegetation and trees can increase publicly available recreation areas, allowing urban communities to enjoy greenery without leaving the city. Additionally, green infrastructure’s vegetation and permeable pavements can reduce noise pollution by damping traffic, train, or plane noise.\nProperty values: By utilizing green infrastructure in construction and increasing vegetation and tree cover, green infrastructure can increase property values', 'Are cities getting hotter? As cities add roads, buildings, industry, and people, temperatures in the city rise relative to their rural surroundings, creating a heat island. These urban heat islands may be up to 10-15°F under optimum conditions. With increasing urban development, heat islands may increase in frequency and magnitude. Los Angeles, California, for example, has been 1˚F hotter every decade for the past 60 years. These heat islands have impacts that range from local to global scales and highlight the importance of urbanization to environmental change.\nWhat is an urban heat island?\nAn urban heat island is the name given to describe the characteristic warmth of both the atmosphere and surfaces in cities (urban areas) compared to their (nonurbanized) surroundings. The heat island is an example of unintentional climate modification when urbanization changes the characteristics of the Earth’s surface and atmosphere.\nAre there different types of urban heat islands?\nThere are three types of heat islands:\n- canopy layer heat island (CLHI)\n- boundary layer heat island (BLHI)\n- surface heat island (SHI)\nThe first two refer to a warming of the urban atmosphere; the last refers to the relative warmth of urban surfaces. The urban canopy layer (UCL) is the layer of air closest to the surface in cities, extending upwards to approximately the mean building height (Figure 1). Above the urban canopy layer lies the urban boundary layer, which may be 1 kilometer (km) or more in thickness by day, shrinking to hundreds of meters or less at night (Figure 1).1 It is the BLHI that forms a dome of warmer air that extends downwind of the city. Wind often changes the dome to a plume shape.\nSchematic depiction of the main components of the urban atmosphere.\nHeat island types vary in their spatial form (shape), temporal (related to time) characteristics, and some of the underlying physical processes that contribute to their development. Scientists measure air temperatures for CLHI or BLHI directly using thermometers, whereas the SHI is measured by remote sensors mounted on satellites or aircraft. 2,3\nWhat are the characteristics of heat islands?\nOverall spatial form (shape) of the heat island\nThe isotherms, or lines of equal temperature, form a pattern that resembles an “island” loosely following the shape of the urbanized region, surrounded by cooler areas (Figure 2). There is often a sharp rise in the canopy-layer air temperature at the boundary of rural—suburban areas, followed by a slow and often variable increase towards the downtown core of the urban area where the warmest temperatures occur. The boundary layer heat island shows much less variability than the other heat island types and a cross-section shows its shape resembles a simple dome or plume with warmer air transported downwind of the city.\nUrban heat island characteristics.\nHeat island intensity\nHeat island intensity is a measure of the strength or magnitude of the heat island. At night, the intensity of the canopy layer heat island is typically in the range of 1° to 3°C, but under optimum conditions intensities of up to 12°C have been recorded.4 The BLHI tends to maintain a more constant heat island intensity both day and night (~1.5° to 2°C). The SHI is usually most distinct during the day when strong solar heating can lead to larger temperature differences between dry surfaces and wet, shaded, or vegetated surfaces.\nSurface characteristics and the heat island\nThe nature of the surface is a strong factor on the spatial patterns of surface and canopy layer air temperature in the city. The temperatures are higher in more densely built up areas, and lower near parks or more open areas (Figure 2). Surface temperatures are particularly sensitive to surface conditions: during daytime, dry, dark surfaces that strongly absorb sunlight become very hot, while lighter and/or moist surfaces are much cooler.2,3 Shading of the surface also helps control the temperature. (For visual examples of the surface heat island, see the “learn more” link, EPA Heat Island Pilot Project, at the end of the article.)\nTemporal form of the heat island\nAll heat islands form because of the differences in the rates of warming and cooling of cities relative to their surroundings.\n- CLHI: the heat island intensity increases with time from sunset to a maximum somewhere between a few hours after sunset to the predawn hours. During the day the CLHI intensity is typically fairly weak or sometimes negative (a cool island) in some parts of the city where there is extensive shading by tall buildings or other structures and a lag in warming due to storage of heat by building materials.\n- SHI: is strongly positive both day and night due to warmer urban surfaces. Daytime SHI is usually largest because solar radiation affects surface temperatures.\n- BLHI: is generally positive both day and night but much smaller in magnitude than CLHI or SHI.\nHow do heat islands form and how are they controlled?\nA number of factors contribute to the occurrence and intensity of heat islands; these include\n- geographic location\n- time of day and season\n- city form\n- city functions\nWeather, particularly wind and cloud, influences formation of heat islands. Heat island magnitudes are largest under calm and clear weather conditions. Increasing winds mix the air and reduce the heat island. Increasing clouds reduce radiative cooling at night and also reduce the heat island. Seasonal variations in weather patterns affect heat island frequency and magnitude.\nGeographic location influences the climate and topography of the area as well as the characteristics of the rural surroundings of the city. Regional or local weather influences, such as local wind systems, may impact heat islands; for example, coastal cities may experience cooling of urban temperatures in the summer when sea surface temperatures are cooler than the land and winds blow onshore. Where cities are surrounded by wet rural surfaces, slower cooling by these surfaces can reduce heat island magnitudes, especially in warm humid climates.5\nTime of day/season: Daytime impacts were discussed in the section called “Temporal form of the heat island.” Seasons play a role, too. Heat islands of cities located in the mid latitudes usually are strongest in the summer or winter seasons. In tropical climates, the dry season may favor large heat island magnitudes.\nCity form comprises the materials used in construction, the surface characteristics of the city such as the building dimensions and spacing, thermal properties, and amount of greenspace. Heat island formation is favored by\n- relatively dense building materials that are slow to warm and cool and store a lot of energy\n- replacement of natural surfaces by impervious or waterproofed surfaces, leading to a drier urban area, where less water is available for evaporation, which offsets heating of the air\n- lower surface reflectivity to solar radiation — dark surfaces such as asphalt roads absorb more sunlight and become much warmer than light-colored surfaces\nCity functions govern the output of pollutants into the urban atmosphere, heat from energy usage, and the use of water in irrigation. Anthropogenic heat, or heat generated from human activities, primarily fossil fuel combustion, can be important to heat island formation.6 Anthropogenic heating usually has the largest impact during the winter season of cold climates in the downtown core of the city.7 In select cases, very densely developed cities may have significant summertime anthropogenic heating that results from high energy use for building cooling.7\nHow do heat islands impact cities?\nHeat islands have a range of impacts for city dwellers,4 including\n- human comfort: positive (winter), negative (summer)\n- energy use: positive (winter), negative (summer)\n- air pollution: negative\n- water use: negative\n- biological activity (e.g., growing season length): positive\n- ice and snow: positive\nSummer heat islands can increase the demand for energy for air conditioning, which releases more heat into the air as well as greenhouse gas emissions, degrading local air quality.8 Higher urban temperatures in the daytime BLHI may increase the formation of urban smog, because both emissions of precursor pollutants and the atmospheric photochemical reaction rates increase.9,10 Heat islands may also directly impact human health by exacerbating heat stress during heat waves, especially in temperate areas, and by providing conditions suitable for the spread of vector-borne diseases.11,12\nBiological solutions for alleviating urban heat islands?\nThe understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying heat island formation provides a basis to develop controls that may promote or alleviate heat islands, but in some cases the application of these controls is difficult. For example, widespread change of the urban surface geometry by spacing buildings is usually not feasible. However, other strategies are possible— for example, using white or other light-colored roofs and pavement.\nA biologically related solution is to use vegetation to reduce urban heat. Vegetation provides important shading effects as well as cooling through evaporation. Some examples include:\n- Planting trees around individual buildings to shade urban surfaces to reduce their temperature, especially roofs and south-, east-, and west-facing walls. The reduction in surface temperature also leads to substantial reductions in energy use for air conditioning.\nTrees can also be used to shade roads and parking lots, which would otherwise become very hot during the day and which store heat for later release at night. Shading of vehicles in parking lots can reduce evaporative emissions from gasoline, which contribute to increased levels of urban ozone.\n“Green roofs” use living vegetation on roofs in order to help reduce heat accumulation of buildings. For example, the city of Chicago has more than 80 municipal and private green roofs as of June 2004, including the first municipal green roof in the country, the City Hall rooftop garden. A green roof is much cooler than a traditional roof because a significant fraction of the absorbed energy is used to evaporate water rather than to heat the roof and the overlying air.\nCreation of greenspace such as parks can be used to assist in cooling of neighborhoods,13,14 and an overall greening of the city can lead to a cooler urban atmosphere.15\nThese strategies can provide cost benefits. A building owner benefits from reduced energy consumption costs. Residents downwind of the urban area benefit from air quality improvements because:\n- pollutants are deposited on trees\n- greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions from air conditioning use are reduced\n- emissions of volatile organic compounds that contribute to urban smog are lessened\n- the rate of ozone formation is potentially reduced\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency has undertaken the Urban Heat Island Pilot Project as part of the Heat Island Reduction Initiative. Pilot cities include Baton Rouge, Chicago, Houston, Sacramento, and Salt Lake City.\nDo urban heat islands affect global climate?\nUrban heat islands themselves are not responsible for global warming because they are small-scale phenomena and cover only a tiny fraction of the Earth’s surface area. However, there are some urban to global scale connections that are worth noting:\nApproximately half of the world’s population currently lives in cities, and this value is expected to increase to 61% by 2030.16 The high rate of urbanization, particularly in the tropics, means that increasing numbers of people will be exposed to impacts resulting from heat islands in the future.\nUrban areas have historically been the site of some of the earliest established observation stations that are used to help construct the global surface temperature record used to document large scale climate changes. The effects of urbanization, and consequently urban heat islands, on these stations over time can lead to some “contamination” of the temperature record. The ability to fully remove these influences remains the subject of some debate since changes can occur independently of population17 and current techniques used to remove urban effects may be inadequate.17-19\nMost greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change come from urban areas. These emissions therefore contribute to both local and global scale weather and climate modification.20 Further urbanization will increase emissions originating from cities. Investigation of the larger scale impacts of urban emissions is seen as an important area of future research.20\nThe climate modifications that have occurred in large cities over the past century show similarities in terms of the rates and magnitude expected with projected future climate changes. Therefore cities may serve as a model for assessing the impacts of, and adaptation strategies to, climate change on both local and global scales.4\nThese factors underscore the importance of urban climates not only to the local environment but also to the state of the environment for the planet as a whole.\n© 2004, American Institute of Biological Sciences.

97	I'm entering a summer race - what's the training like and health risks?	For training, you should be running 15-20 miles across 3-4 runs per week, including one long run. It's important to stay hydrated, but drink to thirst with small sips of water. As for health risks, exercising in hot weather can lead to serious heat illnesses, including heat stroke (body temperature above 106°F), heat exhaustion, and heat cramps. The risk is higher when humidity is high because sweat doesn't readily evaporate from your skin.	"['The timing clock is ticking and with just six weeks to go to JCP Swansea Half Marathon race day we have teamed up with two top athletes in their own right to give you a guide to that all important training advice for the six-week countdown.\nIf you haven’t signed up already then now is the time to do so, and if you are in training you can still benefit from these top tips to get you race ready.\nMara Yamauchi is a British long-distance track and road running athlete, the UK’s second fastest female marathon runner of all time (2:23:12), and a two-time Olympian. Mara is an ASICS Ambassador and internationally recognised leading authority in the running world. Here are Mara’s top ten training tips:\n- Running the distance: if you can, try to run the half-marathon distance in training at least once. That will give you the confidence of knowing you can complete the race.\n- Speed-work: to improve your PB, at some point speed training is essential. For the half marathon, longer intervals are the top priority to build your speed endurance.\n- Ready for the weather? Late June in the UK could be hot, cool, dry, raining, windy – you name it, the weather could do it! Think through how you can prepare best for these different scenarios.\n- Run the course: being familiar with a course in advance helps enormously on race day. If practical, run the course before race day, or at least have a good look at the course map on the race website or on a map.\n- Race day logistics: think through everything you’ll do on race day – what time to have breakfast, getting to the start, what you’ll wear, drinks, how you’ll get home afterwards, etc. If you’re well-organised, that’s less to worry about on race day.\n- Practice eating & drinking: whatever you eat on race day before, during and after the race, is very individual. What suits one runner will be different to others. Practising is essential, so you know if it helps you to run well or not.\n- Have a race plan: having a goal for the race is essential – it could be a certain time, to run the whole way, or just to complete it. When things start to get tough, your goal will motivate you to keep working hard and stay positive.\n- Recovery afterwards: it’s easy to think only as far as the finish line on race day. But if you can plan your recovery – drinks, food, icing sore muscles, getting a good sleep, gentle exercise etc, your body will thank you for it later.\n- Rest up for race day: in the final few days, you will not get any faster by doing more training. You need to toe the start line feeling physically and mentally fresh. So give yourself enough rest before the race to ensure this happens.\n- Enjoy it! At the end of the day, running has to be enjoyable – if it isn’t, motivating yourself will be tough. So make the most of an exciting, challenging day, even if it involves some pain.\nTASH SMITH, Swansea resident and couch to Marathon runner achieved her ultimate goal of running the Virgin Money London Marathon this year. Tash gives us her top tips for the six week build up to race day.\nTime on your feet is vital – you should be averaging 15-20 miles across 3-4 runs per week. Ensuring that you include a long run once a week to get your body used to running those longer distances prior to race day.\nCross-Train – vary your training by adding in cross-training, whether that is using the elliptical trainer or stationary bikes in the gym, or simply using some weights to strengthen your muscles. Cross-training can improve your fitness, help with injury prevention and you will see a difference in your running fitness as a result.\nHydration – staying hydrated is an essential part of running, not just on race day but also during your training. Your core body temperature will increase during your runs prompting your body to keep cool by sweating. It is vital that those fluids are replaced. It is possible to over-hydrate so drink to thirst, replacing those fluids with small sips of water over a period of time.\nStick to what you know – with only 6 weeks to go you should have been training for the half marathon for some time, you should have settled into a pattern in your training and should know what works for you. Don’t start dramatically changing your training regime now, stick to what you know ensuring you’re hitting your mileage.\nRun with friends – sometimes getting out the front door can be tough, why not get motivated by running with a group of friends. You don’t all have to run the same distance if you’re at different stages in your training, meet along a route where you can all cover the distance you need to individually cover. Running with friends will ensure you have company and encourage you to get those miles done.\nRest – don’t forget to rest! Your muscles will need time to recover especially after those long runs, resting will allow your muscles to recover and will help to prevent injury.\nThe JCP Swansea Half Marathon starts at 9.00am on Sunday 26th June in the heart of the city centre and takes runners on fully closed roads along the magnificent six-mile stretch of Swansea Bay towards The Mumbles and back.\nPublic places cost £33 for affiliated athletes and £35 for non-affiliated runners, which includes a fully marshaled course on closed roads, medal, technical t-shirt, on route entertainment, post-race massage and goody bag for all finishers.\nPlaces are filling fast as the countdown to race day draws nearer, so to ensure you get your place and line up with thousands of others to take on Swansea go to www.swanseahalfmarathon.co.uk', '- Table of contents\n- Heat Illness\n- What is heat illness?\n- Activity guidlines\n- National Athletic Trainers Association Parents’ and Coaches’ Guide to Dehydration and Other Heat Illnesses in Children\n- American College of Sports Medicine position stand: Exertional heat illness during training and competition\n- Zunis Foundation\n- NSW Heat Index\n- Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association heat index policy\n- Kentucky High School Athletic Association heat index policy\n- Michigan high school athletic association - Heat/Hydration\n- Indiana High School Athletic Association HEAT INDEX INFORMATION & CHART\n- Otsuka Pharmaceutical\nWhat is heat illness?¶\nYour body normally cools itself by sweating. During hot weather, especially when it is very humid, sweating just isn\'t enough to cool you off. Your body temperature can rise to dangerous levels and you can develop a heat illness.\nMost heat illnesses happen when you stay out in the heat too long. Exercising and working outside in high heat can also lead to heat illness. Older adults (65+), young children (0-4), and those who are sick or overweight are most at risk. Taking certain medicines or drinking alcohol can also raise your risk.\nHeat-related illnesses include\n- Heat stroke - a life-threatening illness in which body temperature may rise above 106° F (41.1° C) [see 1 below] in minutes (10-15 minutes). . If you see any of these signs, get medical help right away.\n- Heat exhaustion - an illness that can happen after several days of exposure to high temperatures and not enough fluids. Symptoms include heavy sweating, rapid breathing, and a fast, weak pulse. If it is not treated, it can turn into heat stroke.\n- Heat cramps - muscle pains or spasms that happen during heavy exercise. You usually get them in your abdomen, arms, or legs.\n- Heat rash - skin irritation from excessive sweating. It is more common in young children.\nYou can lower your risk of heat illness by drinking fluids to prevent dehydration, replacing lost salt and minerals, and limiting your time in the heat.\nIn recent years, excessive heat has caused more deaths than all other weather events, including floods. A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessive heat, often combined with excessive humidity.\nThe heat index is the temperature the body feels when the effects of heat and humidity are combined. Exposure to direct sunlight can increase the heat index by as much as 15° F.\nExercising in hot weather puts extra stress on your body. If you don\'t take care when exercising in the heat, you risk serious illness. Both the exercise itself and the air temperature and humidity can increase your core body temperature.\nTo help cool itself, your body sends more blood to circulate through your skin. This leaves less blood for your muscles, which in turn increases your heart rate. If the humidity also is high, your body faces added stress because sweat doesn\'t readily evaporate from your skin. That pushes your body temperature even higher.\nHeat-related illnesses are largely preventable. By taking some basic precautions, your exercise routine doesn\'t have to be sidelined when the heat is on.\nA WBGT device is a measurement tool that uses ambient temperature, relative humidity, wind, and solar radiation from the sun to get a measure that can be used to monitor environmental conditions during exercise. Establishing WBGT guidelines that dictate modifications in activity (work:rest ratios, hydration breaks, equipment worn, length of practice) at given WBGT temperatures play a huge factor in helping to prevent EHS.\nAs environmental temperature and humidity increase, there is an increase in the heat stress that is placed on the exercising individual. Exercise in the heat causes athletes to rely on evaporation of sweat from the skin as the primary method of dissipating heat that is produced by the working muscles. As humidity increases, the ability to dissipate heat through evaporation is further hindered, thus causing the body to have an increased body temperature, which increases the risk of EHS.\nNational Athletic Trainers Association Parents’ and Coaches’ Guide to Dehydration and Other Heat Illnesses in Children¶\nAmerican College of Sports Medicine position stand: Exertional heat illness during training and competition¶\n|ACSM Risk Category||°F||°C|\n|Wet Bulb Globe Temp [see 2]||NWS Heat Index Temp||Wet Bulb Globe Temp||NWS Heat Index Temp|\n|Very High Risk Zone||82 - 90||98 - 115||27.8 - 32.2||36.7 - 46.1|\n|High Risk Zone||73 - 82||80 - 98||22.8 - 27.8||26.7 - 36.7|\n|Moderate Risk Zone||65 - 73||65 - 80||18.3 - 22.8||18.3 - 26.7|\n|Low Risk Zone||< 65||< 65||<18.3||<18.3|\nEven so, these guidelines, which are approximations, may eventually require minor adjustment as more data becomes available.\nThese risk zones (""low risk zone,"" ""moderate risk zone,"" ""high risk zone,"" ""very high risk zone"" = ""event delay threshold zone"", and ""dangerous zone"") are to be considered advisory.

The cords of high-quality black tea are relatively tight, and the one that is heavy is better, and the one that is rough and light is worse. The main purpose of touchi\nQimen black tea, or Qihong for short, is a treasure of traditional Chinese Kung Fu black tea. It is a famous tea in history. It was produced in the late 19th century and is one of the world’s three high-flavor teas. ""Prince Tea"" and other\nLapsang Souchong black tea entered Europe in 1610. In 1662, when Princess Catherine of Portugal married King Charles II, her dowry contained boxes of Chinese Lapsang Souchong black tea. Since then, black tea was brought to the British court, and drinking\nThe originator of black tea is in China. The earliest black tea in the world was invented by tea farmers in the Wuyishan tea area in Fujian during the Ming Dynasty in China, and it was named "" Lapsang souchong"". The Jiang family in Tongmu Villag\nThe purpose of black tea fermentation is to promote profound changes in the contents and prepare a substrate for the formation of the unique color, aroma and taste qualities of black tea. The essence of black tea fermentation is a chemical change process with the profound oxidation of polyphenol compounds as the core. How to control the fermentation time and temperature of black tea?\nBlack tea is normally fermented for 4 to 6 hours. However, the specific fermentation time depends on the age and tenderness of the tea, the cold and hot weather, the dryness, wetness, and the degree of twisting. Generally, young leaves, well-kneaded raw materials, and high-fermentation temperature leaves ferment quickly and the time is relatively short. Otherwise, the time will be longer. I have encountered that it has not been fermented for 12 hours. As long as it is not sour or stuffy during fermentation. The tea maker must keep track of the fermentation progress.\nFermentation time is only a reference indicator. Whether fermentation should be terminated, or should it be based on the degree of fermentation. Moderate fermentation is generally based on the fact that the leaf color changes to reddish-yellow, the blue aura disappears, and the floral and fruity aroma appears as the standard. If it is mass production, finally use the evaluation method to look at the color of the soup, taste the taste, look at the bottom of the leaf, and check the degree of fermentation. The book says how much temperature and humidity are, and how many hours are normal. The top tea maker only says ""watch tea and make tea"". The way inside is very mysterious!\nTemperature has a great influence on fermentation quality, including air temperature and leaf temperature. The level of temperature directly affects the leaf temperature. During the fermentation process, the polyphenol compounds are oxidized and exothermic, which increases the leaf temperature. The leaf temperature has a changing law from low to high and then low. Fermentation leaf temperature should be kept at 30℃, and the temperature should be 24℃～25℃. The temperature and leaf temperature should not be too high or too low. If the leaf temperature is too high and exceeds 40°C, the fermentation changes will be too intense, resulting in low aroma and low taste and dark color, which will seriously damage the quality. Therefore, cooling measures should be taken in the high temperature season, and the spread leaves should be thin to facilitate heat dissipation and cooling. If the temperature is too low, the fermentation time will be prolonged and the endoplasmic transformation cannot be fully developed. Therefore, when the leaf temperature is too low, the leaf layer should be thickened to facilitate heat preservation, and other heating measures should be taken if necessary.']"	['<urn:uuid:b103c4df-120d-4b85-a804-cd6309212993>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	18	39	881
99	My house has some rooms that are always too hot or too cold - is there any way to control the temperature in different areas separately?	An HVAC zoning system is a heating and cooling system that uses dampers in the ductwork to regulate and redirect airflow to specific areas of your home. This regulation allows for the customized temperature zones throughout the home for increased comfort and efficiency. Zoned systems are most commonly used in homes that have issues keeping certain rooms at comfortable temperatures, due to factors such as large windows, an added bonus room, or a top floor that stays warmer than the main level of the home.	['Take a look at the answers to these frequently asked questions, and feel free to give us a call if you would like any further information.\nGeneral HVAC Knowledge\nQ: What does HVAC stand for?\nA: Heating, Ventilation, & Air Conditioning\nQ: How does my heating & air conditioning system move air throughout my home?\nA: A fan draws indoor air in through vents called return grills located throughout your home. The air travels through ducts that run to your system’s air handler, where it is returned into the conditioned space through supply vents or registers in your wall, ceilings or floors.\nQ: What does SEER mean?\nA: SEER stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER rating of a unit is the cooling output during a typical cooling season, divided by the total electric energy input during the same period of time. The higher the SEER rating, the more efficient your unit is.\nQ: What does the tonnage of my system indicate?\nA: Despite what it sounds like, the tonnage of an HVAC system does not have to do with its weight. A ton is a term of measurement that refers to the amount of heat the AC unit can remove from a home in one hour.\nQ: What is the difference between R-410A refrigerant and R-22 refrigerant?\nA: R-22 is a hydro-chlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), which is harmful to the environment and contributes to ozone depletion. The newer, more efficient, and safer refrigerant is R-410A. This type of refrigerant is hydro-fluorocarbon (HFC), which does not contribute to ozone depletion. Manufacturers have stopped producing equipment that requires R-22 refrigerant and are now solely producing equipment that operates with the environmentally friendly refrigerant, R-410A.\nQ: What is the average lifespan of a heat pump?\nA: This answer varies between brands. The typical lifespan of a heat pump system is between 12-15 years.\nQ: What is a zoned system?\nA: An HVAC zoning system is a heating and cooling system that uses dampers in the ductwork to regulate and redirect airflow to specific areas of your home. This regulation allows for the customized temperature zones throughout the home for increased comfort and efficiency. Zoned systems are most commonly used in homes that have issues keeping certain rooms at comfortable temperatures, due to factors such as large windows, an added bonus room, or a top floor that stays warmer than the main level of the home.\nQ: How often should I replace or clean my air filters?\nA: We recommend changing standard 1” air filters each month. Some filters are reusable, so those need to be cleaned on a monthly basis, as well. If you neglect to change your air filter, your HVAC system has to work much harder to cool and heat your home. By keeping filters changed/cleaned on a monthly basis, you are ensuring the longevity of your system and allowing it to run at its maximum efficiency.\nLarge media filters are built to last between 6 & 12 months. These filters require less attention, but involve a larger investment on the front end. For more information on these filters, please give one of our two locations a call!\nQ: What is emergency heat?\nA: Emergency heat (also known as auxiliary heat) is when your system is running solely on its second stage heat source, which is usually your indoor unit. This setting is the second stage of heat that your thermostat transitions into when it is too cold for your heat pump to bring in heat from outside.\nQ: When should I use emergency heat?\nA: Emergency heat is only to be turned on in the event of the primary heating source being compromised. For example, if a tree happens to fall onto your outdoor unit in the middle of winter, you will need a backup form of heat, which is when your emergency heat comes into play. While the emergency heat is running, we do advise you to call our office in order to have a service technician come out to make repairs.\nQ: Is emergency heat more expensive to run?\nA: Since your second stage heat source is designed to be used on rare occasions (truly making it secondary), it does cost more to be in this stage of heating. Running your heat pump on emergency heat increases the system’s energy usage, resulting in higher energy bills.\nQ: How often should I have my equipment serviced?\nA: For proper routine maintenance, we recommend that you have your equipment serviced twice a year. It is best to have one service done in the cooling season, and one done in the heating season. This ensures that both the heating and cooling components of your equipment have been fully serviced.\nQ: What are the benefits of a scheduled maintenance program?\n- Comprehensive Maintenance Inspections—Inspections will follow industry recommended procedures and will be conducted by qualified, professional service technicians twice a year.\n- No Overtime Charges—If your equipment requires an evening or weekend emergency repair, you will never be charged overtime rates\n- 15% Discount on Parts—If additional parts are needed to repair your equipment, they will be discounted 15%.\n- Priority Service—A maintenance agreement increases HVAC system reliability, but should you need repair service, you will be treated as a priority customer.\n- Efficient Equipment Operation—Everyone knows that their car needs routine oil changes and maintenance to run smoothly and efficiently. Your heating & A/C equipment works the same way. By having it thoroughly inspected, cleaned, and adjusted, you are keeping it running at its peak efficiency level.\n- Extended Equipment Life—Equipment that is well-maintained will have an enhanced life expectancy. Potential problems can be corrected before they become costly repairs.\n- Warranty Protection—Manufacturers recommend having a maintenance agreement on all new equipment. Some warranties may be void if the equipment hasn’t been properly maintained. This is not a warranty against system failure; however, it does reduce failures through proper maintenance and care.\n- Adds to the Value of Your Home—Your maintenance agreement remains with your home if you decide to sell it. The new homeowner will have the same benefits of the agreement, plus the comfort of knowing the equipment has been well-maintained in years past.\n- Peace of Mind—You can be confident that your HVAC equipment is being taken care of by our trained professionals at Webb Heating & Air Conditioning. We have 40 years of experience and always stand behind our work. Customer satisfaction is our ultimate goal!\nQ: Why is my AC system freezing up?\nA: Several factors can cause this issue, most of which will need to be corrected by one of our trained service technicians. Common factors that cause system freezing are dirty filters, low refrigerant, a dirty evaporator coil, or even a defective blower motor or relay. In the event that your system does freeze, we advise you to turn the system off (simply turn thermostat to “off” setting) to thaw out, and then to call for a service technician to come diagnose the issue. We cannot repair a frozen system if it is still frozen.\nQ: How much does it cost to have a service technician come to my house?\nA: To determine the issue at hand, a service technician must run a series of tests in order to come to a diagnosis. We call this a “diagnostic” service call. The cost of this type of service call is $95. If any repairs are necessary, the technician will then quote the repair before moving forward.']	['<urn:uuid:7341ddd3-1693-4651-b001-f10ce70129ad>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:17:10.402332	26	85	1251
100	What are the standard official proportions for pool tables?	"Regulation table size is 9 feet long by 4.5 feet wide, with a 100 inch by 50 inch playing surface (bumper to bumper). The important thing is that the length:width ratio is 2:1. Common smaller varieties are 8' by 4' (92"" by 46"" playing area) or 7' by 3.5' (76"" by 38"" playing area)."	['So, you’ve decided to build a pool table!\nMaking your own billiards table is one of the most satisfying things you’ll ever do, if you get it right. Nothing is more rewarding than sinking balls on something you put together from scratch.\nThere are other benefits too. The table will be easier to maintain, because you’ll know exactly how everything is put together, if you ever need to replace the felt for example. Plus, it’ll be much cheaper than buying a good pre-built table.\nHowever, building a billiards table is by no means easy. You’ll need decent woodworking skills, and a well-equipped workshop to get things done right. This isn’t the sort of project you can do with a saw and a few nails.\nIn this tutorial, we’ll outline a basic guide to building your own pool table. There are actually many different ways of doing this, depending on how you’d like it to look, whether you’ll be using slate for the surface, and how big you’d like the table to be.\nThings you’ll need\nHere’s a comprehensive list of tools, materials and machinery you’ll need to make a top-quality pool table. You may be able to get away with less if you go for a slightly simpler design than the one we’re outlining.\n- A workshop. At a minimum, you should have a table saw and a joiner/router table, depending on how you are making your legs. You’ll also need safety gear, including goggles and gloves (especially when dealing with sharp wood).\n- Lumber – we’ll discuss the specifics as we go.\n- Veneer (optional).\n- Steel brackets/screws (optional).\n- Wood glue.\n- Polyurethane finisher.\n- Bolts – for attaching the rails.\n- Portable clamps.\n- A straight-edge clamp.\n- A level.\n- A drill.\n- An electric sander.\n- A mallet.\n- Shims, if using slate.\n- Razor blade.\n- A staple gun (to attach the felt).\n- A small jigsaw (or something else you can use to cut out the pockets if using MDF).\n- Tape measure.\n- Pool table felt.\n- Pool table cushions.\n- Pool table pockets.\n- Pool table cushion end facings.\n- Under-rail plates (optional, depending on design).\n- Your preferred design/sketching program, like FreeCAD.\nFirst things first, make a design for your pool table. You can use pen/paper or a 3D modeling computer program.\nWhen figuring out the dimensions for your table, consider the following:\n- Regulation table size is 9′ long by 4.5′ wide, with a 100″ by 50″ playing surface (bumper to bumper). Common smaller varieties are 8′ by 4′ (92″ by 46″ playing area) or 7′ by 3.5′ (76″ by 38″ playing area). The important thing is that the length:width ratio is 2:1.\n- Choose the size most appropriate to your room. Ideally, you want the room to be at least 7′ longer and 7′ wider than the table. Meaning, you have at least 3.5′ of room on each of the four sides.\n- The height of the table should be between 29″ and 31″ from the ground to the actual playing surface.\nNow you need to choose a material for your surface.\nPro tables use slate – either in one piece or three pieces. This material is extremely heavy (which is why it’s normally best to get three separate pieces) and can be quite expensive, especially when you consider what it costs to ship. However, it provides a more authentic playing surface, which is why people use it.\nThe other, much easier and cheaper option is to use medium-density fiberboard (MDF). This material will be much easier to work with, but won’t play quite as well as slate. You’ll need to replace it every few years, especially if the table is exposed to humid conditions.\nObviously, you need to check and ensure that your table is as level as possible from the moment you start the build. Once the frame is on, there is very little you can do, other than sanding down the legs or using shims. It’s important to get everything right from the start to avoid leaving the finished product sloping.\nMaking the legs\nAs you’re designing or building a custom pool table, the first thing to consider is the four legs.\nYou have three options here, depending on your surface, skill level, and table size.\n- Mill your own legs from large pieces of maple or another hardwood. You’ll need to ensure that the leg runs parallel to the grain of the lumber.\n- Craft legs from a number of smaller pieces of wood. You would do this by creating an L-shaped frame using lumber boards (2 by 10s for instance) and then gluing more lumber to the inside to make up the bulk of the leg.\n- Buy your own legs. eBay has a decent range at the moment.\nRemember, your legs need to be strong, and they will provide the basis for the table being flat. If a single one is off, this will result in an uneven playing surface.\nTo help avoid such issues, it’s a good idea to use your wood immediately after buying it, to avoid giving it the chance to warp.\nIt’s up to you how you want to style the legs. Typically, if you make your own laminated ones you want them to taper to a point on the inside (with the sharpest point at the feet). This avoids the legs looking too blocky.\nMaking the frame\nYour legs will then attach to a frame, onto which your surface will sit (with another subframe in between, if this makes things easier).\nThis frame should essentially look like a number of boxes, designed to provide even support to your surface material.\nThe most important thing about this frame is that it (or the sub-frame) will cover the areas where your surface screw holes will be. Normally, if you buy slate there will be pre-drilled holes, so you’ll have to check before buying where they’re located. Your frame may have more/thicker/differently-placed struts than the ones shown in the diagram below. You may also like to use thicker wood, especially if you’re not going to be using a sub-frame.\nThis diagram offers a bird’s-eye view, meaning the height of the box isn’t shown. It should be about 10-12″ tall, depending on how long your legs will be.\nOnce you’ve got a diagram done, you can cut your wood to size and begin cutting the dados (the trench slots you use to joint the wood).\nSand down any rough edges, then test to make sure that everything fits perfectly and to ensure that the each and every dado is exactly the right size.\nNow you can grab your glue. There’s a few ways to go about this, but the best way is to get a friend or two to help out, to ensure that everything is square before the glue begins to dry. Use clamps to keep the entire ensemble together as the wood glue dries.\nAlternatively, you can use brackets and screws to join the wood, if you feel like you’d ever need to disassemble the table completely. This will take more time but helps to ensure that everything is in exactly the right place.\nAttaching the legs to the frame\nBefore getting the legs ready to attach to the actual table, finish them off with varnish and/or veneer, depending on the look you’re going for. It’ll be much harder to finish off the legs once they’ve bolted in place. Once you’ve applied enough coats and the finish has dried, lock it in with a coat of clear polyurethane.\nNow you can begin installing the legs. If you’ve made your legs with an inner slot for the frame to sit on, simply place each leg under the table, slotting it into the correct corner, and attach it with bolts. Use the sturdiest screws you can find – 3-5 per leg should do the job. Have one going straight down into the leg, and one or two securing it from each side.\nThis is a top-down view. If we rotate to a horizontal view, the surface should be perfectly flat – the two pieces of wood should sit flush. The extrusion will be covered by our rails or sub-frame.\nAlternatively, with pre-bought or vertical legs, you’ll have to place the frame on top of the actual leg, which may require that the corners have a little more bulk to them.\nInstalling the sub-frame\nAt this point you can add an extra bit of height to the table (and stability to the surface) by installing a sub-frame. It should go over the edges (covering the legs) and the main struts – ultimately, this is what the slate or MDF will be resting on.\nIf you choose not to install a sub-frame, that’s fine, but your legs might have to be a bit longer. You’ll also have to ensure that the actual frame is incredibly sturdy.\nHere’s what the sub-frame should look like – it’s shown at 50% opacity, so you can see it over the edges.\nNote: at this point, whether you’ve installed a sub-frame or not, you need to double-check that the table is as level as possible.\nPlacing the surface\nNow you can place your surface on the actual table.\n- If you’re using slate, it should come with an MDF backing which can rest on top of the sub-frame. Slide the pieces into place, and screw them in, being very careful not to split the beams. Then, check (ideally with a machine leveler) if the surface is level. If it isn’t, you’ll need to use hardwood shims to adjust the pieces. This is why having three slabs of slate rather than a big single one makes thing much easier. You can fill the seams between the pieces if you like with melted beeswax, but it’s not 100% necessary if the slate fits nice and snug as-is.\n- If you’re using MDF or another type of wood, you’ll first need to cut the pockets out – this won’t be done for you. According to WPA specifications, the opening or “mouth” of the pocket is supposed to be between 4.5″ and 4.625″ wide between the corners of each bumper. You’ll need to cut the holes accordingly using a jigsaw since they won’t be perfectly rounded. Also consider the shape of the pockets you’ve chosen and how forgiving you’d like the pockets to play. Once you’ve cut the holes, you’ll need to attach the MDF with screws which will sit flush to the surface. Don’t be tempted to use glue – if you ever need to replace the wood (if it warps, for example), screws are much easier to remove.\nMaking the rails\nThis is another area where your woodworking skills are going to be put to the test.\nEach rail will essentially be made up of four parts.\n- The rail itself.\n- The featherstrip, which is a piece of wood sitting in a channel on the actual rail used to pinch the felt into place. You can buy your own, or use something like poplar wood. Note that the featherstrip itself needs to be about 2mm thinner than the groove, otherwise the felt won’t have room to get inside it.\n- The bumper, which is a piece of rubber attached to the inner section of the rail to give it some bounce.\n- The blind, which is a piece of lumber coming down from the outer edge of the rail, perpendicular to the floor, to hide the underside of the table.\nHere’s a top-down view of a side rail:\nWhat this view doesn’t show is the blind, which comes down at a 90-degree angle from the left-hand edge.\nWhen making the rails, you need to consider the bolt holes you’ll be using to attach them to the table, and how the pockets will attach. Most pre-made pockets come with special “ears” which you will need to make a notch for. For the actual rails, you may need under-rail plates for the bolts to ensure a solid attachment and to protect the wood over time.\nTo glue the rubber bumper onto the felt, you can use contact cement or super glue. It’s essential that you get the rubber at the right angle, otherwise the ball won’t rebound properly.\nAs you install it, you’ll need to trim the edges off with your razor blade (so that they match the angle of the wood), and then glue on the cushion end facings. They’re designed to sit on the edge of the rubber and rail (on the inner edges of the pockets) to prevent the ball hitting solid wood or bouncing inconsistently when it impacts the inside of the pockets.\nAt this point, you can glue on your blinds, and apply your chosen finisher to the wood to get it looking ready to install.\nOnce you’ve got all the bolt holes in the right places. the cushions are on, and you’re sure that the playing surface is right, you can felt the rails. This can be a bit tricky – you need to pinch the felt in the featherstrip using your mallet, then pull it down under the rail and staple it into place, ensuring not to cover any of your bolt holes.\nDon’t attach the rails to the table just yet though – you still need to felt the surface.\nFelting the surface\n- Lay your felt on the table, and check both sides for imperfections and dust. If you’ve got someone willing to help, have each of you hold an end and then shake the felt gently to clear off any hidden dust. You may also want to sweep the slate/MDF to remove anything which could cause the ball to roll inconsistently.\n- Cut off a small strip of felt to use for the pocket-liners. These pocket-liners cover the outer edges of the slate which the ball drops by as it enters the pocket. They’re not strictly necessary, but you’ll have to fold the felt down and then cut it to cover this area if you don’t use them, which can be a bit tricky.\n- Attach the pocket-liners (if you’re using them) with your super glue, ensuring a clean finish. Cut off any excess with your razor.\n- Now you can attach the actual felt with your nail gun. No glue is required – this can introduce bumps if done incorrectly. Begin with a side pocket, then do the two corner pockets on that side. Then do the rest of the edge on that side. Repeat the process on the other side, then do the two short sides. Use plenty of staples, and remember to pull the felt taught for the second, third, and fourth sides you do. Ensure that there’s an even amount of felt overhanging all four sides before doing the first pocket.\n- If you chose to use separate pocket-liners as opposed to folding the felt down, you can make a simple cut along the curve as the pocket drops off. However, if you’re looking to fold the felt down, you’ll need to make five or so vertical cuts on the excess felt, and then staple each piece for a flush finish.\n- Cut holes in your fabric for the rail bolts, using the bolt holes in the slate as a guide.\nFirst, bolt on your rails – this thing should be beginning to look like a pool table now!\nThen, attach your pockets – plug the ears into the gaps you made for them, and screw them in.\nThe final thing to do is mark your lines. If you’d like to keep things simple, you can simply place two specially-made pool table spots down the center line of the table at each end.\n- On 7′ tables, they should be 19 1/2″ from each end.\n- On 8′ tables, they should be 22″ from each end.\n- On 9′ tables, they should be 25″ from each end.\nYou can then draw a balk line parallel to the balk cushion if you wish, but it’s not strictly necessary. Use string, attached to the rails with tape, to ensure a straight line. Double and triple check your measurements with a ruler, then mark the line with your ruler and a black felt tip pen. You can use chalk to make a practice line if you like.\nIf you’re just looking for a fairly basic pool table, like a table-top one, it is possible to modify this method a little bit.\nFor example, you could just make the frame, use an MDF surface, buy pre-built rails (if you can find them) and then place it on an existing table to make things easier.\nNothing beats the satisfaction of building your own full-fledged 9′ table though. If you’ve got the woodworking skills (and workshop to match), it’s a project that’s definitely worth trying.\nGot any questions?
