1	Who can legally draw blood for DUI tests?	Blood must be withdrawn by authorized medical professionals including physicians, certified paramedics, registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, or others authorized by hospitals, as well as licensed laboratory directors, supervisors, technologists or technicians. In Michigan specifically, only a licensed physician or an individual operating under the delegation of a licensed physician may draw blood under the implied consent law.	"['When Can Police Request a Blood Test?\nUnder Florida law, police may request a blood test in one of four scenarios.\n- First, under the Florida Implied Consent Law (Section 316.1932, Florida Statutes) police may request blood where a DUI suspect appears for treatment at a hospital, clinic, or other medical facility and the administration of a breath or urine test is impractical or impossible.\n- Second, police may take a blood sample where a health care provider, who is treating a person injured in a motor vehicle accident, takes a blood test of the patient and then notifies police that the patient’s blood alcohol level exceeds the legal limit. In this scenario, as outlined in Section 316.1932, police may then request the withdrawal of a blood sample pursuant to Florida law.\n- Third, police in Florida may obtain a blood sample where a DUI suspect was involved in a motor vehicle crash and is determined to have caused death or serious bodily injury. Where there is death or bodily injury, Section 316.1933, Florida Statutes, provides that the blood test may be compelled, even through the use of ‘reasonable force.’\n- Fourth, police may obtain a blood sample from a DUI suspect on the basis of voluntary consent. For additional information on consent to a blood test, visit our web page on Florida’s Implied Consent Law.\nProcedures for Blood Testing\nWhere a blood test is requested or compelled in a Florida DUI case, strict procedures must be followed with regard to the extraction, labeling, storage, transport, and testing of the sample. Even seemingly insignificant non-compliance can affect the validity of the blood result and its admissibility in a court of law.\nThe procedures governing blood testing in Florida are outlined in Chapter 11D-8 of the Florida Administrative Code. With regard to collection, extraction, and labeling, a medical professional or authorized technician must abide by the following procedures:\n- Before collecting a sample, the skin puncture area must be cleansed with an antiseptic that does not contain alcohol.\n- Blood samples must be collected in a glass evacuation tube that contains a preservative such as sodium fluoride and an anticoagulant such as potassium oxalate or EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid). Compliance with this section can be established by the stopper or label on the collection tube, documentation from the manufacturer or distributor, or other evidence.\n- Immediately after collection, the tube must be inverted several times to mix the blood with the preservative and anticoagulant.\n- Blood collection tubes must be labeled with the following information: name of person tested, date and time sample was collected, and initials of the person who collected the sample.\n- Blood samples need not be refrigerated if submitted for analysis within seven (7) days of collection, or during transportation, examination or analysis. Blood samples must be otherwise refrigerated, except that refrigeration is not required subsequent to the initial analysis.\n- Blood samples must be hand-delivered or mailed for initial analysis within thirty days of collection, and must be initially analyzed within sixty days of receipt by the facility conducting the analysis. Blood samples which are not hand-delivered must be sent by priority mail, overnight delivery service, or other equivalent delivery service.\n- Lastly, the blood must be withdrawn by a physician, certified paramedic, registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, or other person authorized by the hospital, or by a licensed laboratory director, supervisor, technologist or technician.\nDefenses to a Blood Test- Florida\nUnder Florida law, there are multiple ways to challenge the validity or admissibility of a DUI blood test.\nIf the prosecution fails to establish that the test was conducted in substantial compliance with the Florida Administrative Code provisions, then the results may be suppressed for lack of evidentiary reliability. Common examples include:\n- Improper collection;\n- Alcohol contamination (during sterilization);\n- Contamination by microorganisms;\n- Failure to properly preserve the blood sample;\n- Lack of refrigeration (when required);\n- Lack of training or certification by the person withdrawing or testing the blood;\n- Break downs in the chain of custody;\n- Any other testing non-compliance that undermines the reliability of the results.\nDefenses may also arise where a defendant’s legal rights are violated in the course of a DUI investigation. Common examples include:\n- Lack of probable cause or reasonable suspicion for the initial traffic stop;\n- Lack of reasonable suspicion to request field sobriety exercises;\n- Lack of probable cause to make an arrest for DUI;\n- Lack of evidence that the defendant caused the crash resulting in death or bodily injury (if applicable);\n- Misstatements of law or legal authority;\n- Invalid consent (if applicable);\n- Breath or urine test not impossible or impractical (if applicable);\n- Lack of probable cause to believe that the defendant was under the influence of alcohol or other substances at the time of a crash;\nContact an Attorney\nIf you have been arrested for Driving Under the Influence in Jacksonville, Duval County, Clay County, or Nassau County, Florida and were subjected to a DUI blood test, you may have defenses available to contest the charge or to minimize potential penalties.

Blood tests are considered to be more accurate, but are used less, because they take more time and resources. Blood is more common in personal injury and accident cases, and are used when the arrested person refuses the breath test, which triggers, the Implied Consent Law.\nIf there has been an accident and blood is drawn for medical purposes, the police can seek to obtain the blood test results directly from the hospital, but hospital blood tests pose other challenges because hospitals usually test only serum rather than whole blood.\nIn order for the prosecutor to use these blood draws, the prosecutor must show the following rules apply:\nIt is also universally acknowledged that the blood alcohol concentration is higher when drawn for medical purposes. Some studies finding it will be up to 60 percent higher. The Administrative Code Rules governing blood tests state that, “Serum or plasma alcohol concentrations shall be expressed as an equivalent whole blood alcohol concentration.”\nSo first we\'re exploring why the blood was drawn - if it was for medical purposes, did the officer request it, or was it done outside of that request, then we must determine if any conversions need to be done on the BAC reading.\nAssuming the reason for drawing of the blood is ok, we need to look at how it was drawn. The Administrative Code Rules governing the collection of blood samples require the use of “an aqueous solution of a nonvolatile antiseptic on the skin of the person from whom the sample is being collected. Neither alcohol nor any alcoholic solution shall be used as a skin antiseptic.”\nOnly a licensed physician or an individual operating under the delegation of a licensed physician may draw blood under the implied consent law.\nWhen a person is drawing blood pursuant to the request of a police officer (whether consensual or via warrant), the person will use a blood draw kit provided by the MSP. The kits contain a nonalcohol swab, two stoppered vials containing sodium fluoride to prevent coagulation and to prevent neogeneration of alcohol in the vials, and stickers to seal the box for mailing to the MSP crime lab. Other than the stoppers, there is no seal for the individual vials.\nIn addition to the Administrative Code Rules, the courts have set forth a list of requirements to ensure the integrity of the blood draw and analysis, which were laid out in People v Cords, 75 Mich App 415, 427, 254 NW2d 911 (1977)\n(1) that the blood was timely taken (2) from a particular identified body (3) by an authorized licensed physician, medical technologist, or registered nurse designated by a licensed physician, (4) that the instruments were sterile, (5) that the blood taken was properly preserved or kept (6) and labeled and (7) if transported or sent, the method and procedures used therein, (8) the method and procedures used in conducting the test, and (9) that the identity of the person or persons under whose supervision the tests were conducted be established.”\nAll 9 requirements can be cross-examined at a suppression hearing or at trial.\nThe forensic lab uses gas chromatography to determine the BAC level. Gas chromatography does not really test blood at all. Rather, it draws some blood out of one of the vials and places it in a new vial along with a chemical to make it react. It heats this solution and then tests the resulting vapor above this mixture, which is known as the head space.\nThe basic procedure followed by the state crime lab is as follows: The samples are received in the mail by the state police crime lab. The sample is checked by a technician to determine whether the seal has been broken or tampered with. If it has, the technician records that fact. The technician then opens the sealed kit, adds it to the lab’s inventory records, gives it a unique laboratory number, and places it in a locked cold storage area for later analysis.\nWhen it is ready to be tested, the technician places a small portion of blood from one of the two vials (the other vial is left untouched) into two more separate vials and dilutes one with 1-Propanol and the other with t-Butanol, so they will produce a vapor in a gas chromatograph. Each prepared sample is placed in a separate chromatograph where the vapor is heated so it will pass through a glass column and is timed and measured as it passes out the other end of the column.\nEach chromatograph produces a chromatogram, which is compared with a calibration curve, and the amount of blood alcohol is determined by reading where the sample peak passes over the calibration curve. The lab then rounds each chromatogram’s number down to two decimal places and reports the lower of the two chromatogram results.\nIt\'s important to request and receive the entire blood packet, because a defense attorney is usually only handed a single page result with a number; there is so much more information to gather to challenge the blood results. You want those tech notes recorded when the sample arrived, the condition of the sample and notes about the storage. The two chromatograms are usually not even the same number yet a single number is reported.\nWhile each sample is prepared separately by a lab agent, the testing is automated. Each test sample is placed into an autoloader, along with some blanks (whole blood with no alcohol) and some control samples (whole blood with a known amount of alcohol). The lab places blanks and control samples throughout an entire run to ensure the integrity of the results. It\'s very important to obtain the results of the entire run to ensure that each blank and each control sample produced a result consistent with the known quantity, or lack thereof, of ethanol.\nAlong with vetting the testing process, we need to know the condition of the blood when it was tested, because microbes that occur naturally in the environment can change the sugars in the blood into alcohol. If the equipment is not sterile, if the vials are not properly sealed, if the preservative is not adequate, or if microbes are introduced through the injection of the needle into the stoppers, there is a chance for the fermentation process to neogenerate alcohol.\nThe state lab has the ability to check for neogeneration of alcohol by analyzing the glucose level in the vials or by comparing the ethanol to carbon dioxide ratio in the head space gas. However, it does not do so, and this is vital to cross-exam the MSP representative on.\nThe lab technician is supposed to note any indications that the seal on the box containing the two vials has been tampered with, the expiration date of the blood kit, and any indication that the vials themselves have lost their seals. The technician should also note whether he or she detected any coagulation of the blood sample. This can occur if the anticoagulant is not properly mixed with the blood sample by the person who drew the blood. Sometimes, if the technician detects coagulation, he or she will put the sample in a centrifuge to remove the solids. This can result in an artificially high result because only the liquid portion gets tested.\nFormer NYC & Michigan Prosecutor\nSelected - 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 & 2018\nThe most alarming part of the blood testing process is the blood sample kits are simply mailed off from the police department to the MSP lab, and ride next your Amazon boxes in the mail truck. There\'s special services in Michigan for delivering fresh and perishable food, yet blood is just throw in the mail truck in all different conditions and temperatures.\nThe interesting part is MSP will store the blood in the a cold storage after it is logged in, even though it has not been in cold storage for many days. This is like shipping chicken in the mail, then sticking it in the fridge three days later, and believing that it\'s still the same chicken as it was when it was shipped.\nThe lab report will contain the date the lab received the sample, along with the date of testing, but it\'s important to FOIA the entire chain of custody from the defendant\'s arm to the MSP testing process.\nIt\'s VERY important to object to any prosecutor requests to simply use the lab without the ability to cross-exam the lab agent, which they are able to do under MCR 6.202, that the prosecutor intends to introduce the report without the necessity of a live witness from the lab.\nUnless you have the live witness present, you would need your own defense expert to come in and help defeat the blood results. While some cases may call for that extra witness, it is a viable solution to use the prosecutor\'s witness to your own case\'s benefit, but if they are not present, you can\'t do that.\nIf a client is charged based on drugs being in their system either with or without alcohol, the blood draw will be used to show the presence of drugs in my client\'s blood.\nThe MSP tests for drugs using the same gas chromatography process it uses for testing for alcohol in blood, but then it adds a second step of running some of the carrier gas through a mass spectrometer. The gas chromatograph detects possible drugs the same way it detects possible ethyl alcohol. The carrier gas passes through a long column and comes out the end at a known time.\nIf a substance is detected at a time for a known chemical, as it leaves the gas chromatograph column, it passes through a chamber where it is bombarded with an electron beam to create ions as the molecules break into smaller pieces. The mass of each fragment, expressed as the atomic weight, is used to identify the substance by analyzing the molecular pattern of the fragments using an adjustable scanning mass filter. Only fragments with a specific mass can pass through the filter at a given time, but the selected mass can be changed in milliseconds, enabling the mass spectrometer to analyze many different substances nearly simultaneously.\nThe lab test is looking for illegal drugs along with prescription drugs. Depending upon if you have a prescription or a medical marijuana card, what the blood test turns up could put you on the right side or the wrong side of the law. Even with a valid prescription or a medical card, the prosecutor can show impairment, which is a step above presence to still prosecute you for your blood containing a substance that is ""legal"" - remember, if you\'re 21, alcohol is ""legal"" to have in your system, but it\'s the amount and the impact it has on you, which is against the law.']"	['<urn:uuid:eccd1c21-1f5a-45fd-bb6c-15f485818350>', '<urn:uuid:081041ee-d0a3-43a3-91f2-7f95c93fb840>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	8	58	2710

3	Being familiar with various cardiac treatments, I'd like to understand the specific approach of using cardioversion for A-Fib - what does this procedure entail and how is it administered?	Cardioversion is a treatment that uses electrical shock and medications to convert irregular heart rhythm back to normal rhythm. It can be performed either on an emergency basis or scheduled in advance. Since the procedure can be painful, patients are typically medicated and sedated when possible.	['What do Heart Palpitations Mean\nHeart palpitations making your worried? Feeling a little flutter in your chest and wondering if it is something serious? Is your heart skipping a beat and scaring you to death (pardon the pun)? Heart palpitations are actually very common. Are they serious? Well, that depends.\nMost heart palpitations are benign and temporary. That flutter in your chest can be caused by many factors including:\n- Some medications may cause heart palpitations.\nHeart palpitations become a concern when they are persistent and/or accompanied by other symptoms. Some of these symptoms include:\n- Shortness of breath\n- Syncope (fainting)\n- Chest pain\n- Rapid rate of 100-175 beats per minute or more.\nIf you experience any of these symptoms or your heart palpitations are not resolving then it is time to see your doctor. Your heart palpitations could be a sign of Atrial fibrillation or A-Fib.\nWhat is A-Fib?\nAtrial fibrillation or A-Fib is a serious heart condition that can be treated and controlled. Your heart has a sort of internal electrical system which sends signals to the heart muscles telling them when to contract and relax. These contractions are what brings blood flow into the heart and sends it to the rest of your body in a regular rhythmic pattern. When our electrical system goes haywire the heart begins to quiver creating an abnormal heart rhythm called an arrhythmia. A-fib is one such arrhythmia. It is an abnormal heart rhythm. In fact it is the most common heart arrhythmia. When someone has A-fib, parts of their heart can not contract in a coordinating pattern and the heart can’t pump enough blood to meed their body’s needs. This is when heart palpitations become serious.\nWhat Causes A-Fib\nThere are many causes of A-fib and some people have higher risk factors than others. For example:\n- Coronary artery disease\n- History of Myocardial Infarction (heart attack)\n- Heart Failure or enlarged heart\n- Heart Valve Disease\n- Sick Sinus Syndrome\n- Binge drinking and alcoholism.\nA-Fib can come and go. Your heart may spontaneously revert back to a normal rhythm and you may not always be symptomatic. The problem comes in that Atrial Fibrillation is a common cause of stroke. Therefore, it must be treated.\nA-Fib Treatment Options\n1. Cardioversion: Cardioversion uses electrical shock and medications to convert your irregular rhythm back into a normal rhythm. This is often done on an emergent basis or it can be scheduled in advance. Cardioversion can be painful and so patients are medicated and sedated for the procedure if possible.\n2. Daily Medications: Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or Digoxin may be used to slow the heart rate and keep the heart palpitation from coming back. There are people in whom these medications don’t work or only have a minimal effect.\n4. Radio-frequency ablation and pacemaker: Radio-frequency ablation actually destroys a specific area of your heart that is responsible for causing the arrhythmia. People will often need a pacemaker implanted after this procedure.\nHeart palpitation are usually nothing to get worried about. However, if your heart palpitations persist you could have a heart arrhythmia and be at risk for stroke. Do not delay a trip to your physician to have your irregular heart beat checked out. Because, addressing the question of whether heart palpitations are serious, the answer is: Sometimes!']	['<urn:uuid:aaac3ae7-7dab-48ba-a8bc-a0ffcce0fe25>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	29	46	559
4	dairy free milk substitutes nutrients protein comparison fat content sour cream alternatives	Several dairy-free alternatives exist with varying nutritional profiles. For milk, soya milk contains the highest protein at 3g per 100ml, while coconut milk is low in protein but rich in vitamins C, E, B1, B3, B5, and B6. Hemp milk is high in fat (2.5g/100ml) but provides significant omega-3. For sour cream alternatives, cashews offer 5g protein per ounce and 12g fat, while soy-based alternatives contain about 5g fat per ounce, similar to regular sour cream. Coconut milk can also be used as a sour cream substitute, particularly the cream that forms on top of full-fat coconut milk.	['The seven Best Substitutes for Sour Cream\nThe seven Best Substitutes for Sour Cream\nSour cream is a favorite fermented milk product that is consumed in an assortment of ways.\nIt’s frequently utilized as a condiment atop meals as baked potatoes and soups, though it is able to also be used as an element in goods that are baked as cakes, biscuits and cookies.\nIt’s made by blending cream, and that is the high fat layer skimmed off the top of entire dairy, with lactic acid germs. These bacteria use the sugars inside the cream, generally known as lactose, and also release lactic acid as being a waste product.\nThe lactic acid can cause the cream to be more acidic, causing a tangy, sour flavor.\nWhile sour cream is a favorite meal for many, a number of folks cannot or do not wish to use it on account of preferences, allergies or intolerances.\nThis article lists the seven greatest substitutes for sour lotion, including how to utilize them.\nFactors You might Need a Substitute\nWooden Spoon and sour Cream\nShare on Pinterest\nYou might have to substitute sour lotion for a variety of purposes, including:\nDairy allergy: Cow’s dairy is a typical allergen. Between 2-3 % of kids under the age of 3 are sensitive to milk. Though statistics show that around eighty % of kids outgrow this particular allergy, a number of individuals must stay away from milk for life (one).\nLactose intolerance: Lactose is a high sugar found in dairy products. Individuals who are lactose intolerant cannot break it down on account of a deficiency of lactase, the enzyme must decompose lactose (two, three).\nVegan diet: Some opt to exclude pet products from the diets of theirs. For instance, anyone on a vegan diet plan eat strictly plant based ingredients for reasons that are many, which includes health, environmental concerns and animal welfare.\nHealth reasons: Many folks stay away from milk and milk options for a selection of health reasons, which includes hormonal health and skin, while others are worried about using antibiotics plus growth hormones in milk cows (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).\nLow-fat diets: Regular sour lotion is rather high in fat. In reality, ninety one % of the energy in regular sour product come from fat. Though this particular nutrient is incredibly important, lots of people decide to reduce fat when trying to shed additional pounds (six).\nTaste or missing ingredient: Some individuals just do not look after sour cream ‘s tangy flavor. Or perhaps a substitute is required since no sour cream can be obtained to bake a popular cake or top a newly made container of chili.\nSome people cannot or will not eat this common condiment for reasons that are many.\nFortunately, a lot of dairy and non dairy alternatives make excellent substitutes for it.\n1-4: Dairy Based Substitutes You will find several great dairy choices for changing sour cream, which includes Greek yoghurt, cottage cheese, crème fraîche as well as buttermilk.\n- Greek Yogurt\nGreek yogurt can make a great stand in for sour cream.\nWhile regular yogurt has a greater percent of liquid, or maybe whey, Greek yogurt have been strained to eliminate a significant part of its whey. The effect is a fuller, tangier variation of yogurt which is extremely much like sour cream.\nWhat is more often, Greek yogurt is reduced in fat and calories and greater in proteins than full-fat sour cream.\nOne ounce (twenty eight grams) of average Greek yogurt contains thirty seven calories, three grams of fat and two grams of protein. The very same amount of full fat sour cream contains fifty four calories, six grams of fat and one gram of protein (six, seven).\nGreek yogurt could be used as an alternative in dips, toppings and dressings.\nAdditionally, the same periods of full fat Greek yogurt can be worn in place of regular sour cream in virtually any recipe, which includes baked goods.\nGreek yoghurt is a strained yogurt which has a heavy consistency similar to sour cream. Nevertheless, it’s lower in fat and calories and may be used as an alternative for sour cream in most dishes.\n- Cottage Cheese\nThis cheese boasts a rich history. In reality, the title cottage cheese is believed to possess been coined within the 18th century when American settlers pre-owned dairy scraps from butter making to produce a smooth cheese in their little homes identified as cottages.\nCottage cheese is a cheese curd item. Curds are the strong parts of milk that are outstanding coming from the cheesemaking process, while whey stands out as the liquid portion.\nIt’s moderate with a creamy and soft texture. Moreover, it’s available in an assortment of body fat percentages plus curd sizes, which range from small to big.\nWhat is more, cottage cheese is significantly lower in fat and calories and greater in proteins than sour cream.\nMore than half a cup (112 grams) has 110 calories, five grams of fat as well as 12.5 grams of protein rich food. For guide, fifty percent a cup of sour lotion has 222 calories, twenty two grams of fat and simply 2.5 grams of proteins (six, eight).\nThis cheese can make a good lower-fat, higher-protein substitute.\nIn reality, one glass of cottage cheese could be combined with four tablespoons of milk and two teaspoons of fresh lemon juice to switch sour cream in a recipe.\nCottage cheese is a smooth, mild cheese which is lower in fat and calories and considerably higher in proteins than sour cream. It may be put together with lemon juice and milk to be used rather than sour cream in dishes.\n- Crème Fraîche\nCrème fraîche actually means fresh cream. This milk product is extremely much like sour cream and created by incorporating a bacterial society to heavy cream.\nWhile much like sour lotion, crème fraîche has a thicker, cheese like consistency and its taste is less tangy.\nUnlike Greek yogurt and cottage cheese, it has a greater amount of calories and fat than sour cream. Consequently, it might not be the best option for those calorie counting.\nA one ounce (28 gram) serving packs hundred calories and eleven grams of fat, and that is almost double the total amount in sour cream (six, nine).\nAlthough crème fraîche is a calorie dense food, the high fat content of its causes it to be an ideal ingredient in soups and sauces, as you are able to boil it without stressing about separation.\nCrème fraîche could be utilized as a simple one-to-one replacement for sour cream, but always keep in your mind that the milder flavor of its can come across in the flavor of the foods.\nCrème fraîche is quite much like sour cream but much higher in calories and fat. It may be used as a one-to-one replacing, however, the mild flavor of its might alter the flavor of dishes.\nTraditionally, the phrase buttermilk described the fluid leftover from the method of making butter from cultured lotion.\nThis process required leaving whole milk out to rest for a short time. It permitted the cream and dairy to separate, making the heavy cream top utilized in butter making.\nDuring the sleeping time period, naturally occurring lactic acid germs fermented the dairy sugars, resulting in a tangy liquid called buttermilk.\nAlthough it is still prevalent in Pakistan and India, it is implemented less in the West.\nLike sour cream, business buttermilk is pasteurized, with the germs included in after the heating system.\nAlthough the tangy taste of its is akin to which of sour cream, it’s a fluid and may just be used as an alternative for sour cream in goods that are baked or even dressings.\nButtermilk is a tangy fluid which may be used as an alternative for sour cream in goods that are baked or even dressings.\n5-7: Non Dairy Alternatives In addition to milk substitutes for sour lotion, you will find several non dairy alternatives you are able to use. These vegan friendly choices include coconut milk, soy products and cashews.\n- Coconut Milk\nCoconut milk is a superb non dairy way to sour cream.\nNot to be confused with avocado clean water, coconut milk comes from meat of newly grated coconut.\nIt’s a staple component in Southeast Asian, South American & Caribbean cuisines and is now ever more popular in North America.\nCoconut milk is vegan and lactose-free, which makes it a good option for people with dietary restrictions or milk allergies (10).\nInterestingly, it can make an outstanding replacement for sour cream.\nThe lotion on top part of full fat coconut milk could be skimmed off and combined with apple cider vinegar, orange juice and salt to be utilized as a plant based sour cream replacement to top the favorite dishes of yours.\nFull-fat coconut milk may also make a great sour cream replacement in goods that are baked. Simply put in one tablespoon of fresh lemon juice for every glass of coconut milk to imitate the sour flavor.\nCoconut milk is a vegan friendly sour cream substitute which can be quickly used in numerous recipes.\nWhile it may come as a shock, cashews would be a good replacement for sour cream.\nCashews are buttery, sweet-tasting nuts which are quite high in fat. The high fat content of theirs is really what makes them a great dairy free substitute for sour cream.\nOne ounce (twenty eight grams) offers 155 calories as well as twelve grams of fat. Cashews are a fantastic protein source as well, at five grams per ounce (eleven).\nA wealthy as well as tangy vegan sour cream may be reached by blending soaked cashews with vinegar, orange juice and salt.\nThis dairy free sour cream substitute makes a fantastic addition to sauces and side dishes, although it might not be great for baking.\nCashews are a high fat nut which may be soaked and blended with vinegar, orange juice as well as salt for a vegan model of sour cream.\nThere are lots of commercial soy based sour cream substitutes in the marketplace which are suitable for vegans and anyone with an allergy to dairy products.\nMost soy based sour cream options have a comparable quantity of fat and calories as the actual thing.\nFor instance, a typical 1 ounce serving of soy based sour cream has fifty seven calories and five grams of excess fat, while the same volume of sour cream has fifty four calories and six grams of fat (six, twelve).\nWhat is more often, these items may be used as being a one-to-one replacing for sour cream of dishes and baking, which makes them a handy choice for those that do not eat dairy.\nNevertheless, they usually contain a selection of ingredients, such as added preservatives and sugars, which some individuals may wish to stay away from for health reasons.\nFortunately, you can easily make a soy based model of sour cream at your home. Simply mix silken bean curd with apple cider vinegar, salt and lemon juice.\nSummary: Commercial and homemade soy based sour creams are ideal for vegans as well as anyone with an allergy to dairy. They may be worn rather than sour cream in dishes.\nThe Bottom Line\nSour cream is a favorite ingredient. Nevertheless, some individuals want a delicious option because of allergies, preferences or just since they require a fast replacement for a formula.\nFortunately, there are a multitude of appropriate dairy and non dairy stand ins for sour cream.\nSome sour cream replacements should be used for dressings and toppings, while others make an excellent add-on to baked goods.\nIn case you’re searching for an alternative for sour cream which will not compromise the taste of the favorite dish of yours, selecting an alternative from this list will be the best option.', 'What are the healthiest milk alternatives?\nThere was once a time when your choice of milk was limited to full-fat, semi skimmed or skimmed cows milk.\nToday however there is an extensive range of alternative milks on offer, from almond and coconut to hemp and soya. These are catering to the increasing number of people showing signs of lactose-intolerance as well as those who dislike the taste of traditional milk.\nBelow we take a look at some of the most popular alternatives to cows milk and the benefits they offer:\nLactose is a natural sugar found in milk which can only be broken down in the digestive system by the enzyme, lactase. Some people do not have this enzyme, and therefore will experience painful cramps, bloating, and diarrhoea whenever they consume high quantities of lactose. Lactose-free milk offers all the positives of cows milk – including the taste and same fat content – but already contains the enzyme which breaks down the lactose.\nA great choice for vegans, almond milk is non-animal-derived and is much lower in calories than normal semi-skimmed milk – with just 24kcal per 100ml. Almond milk is very sweet tasting with a hint of nuttiness, and it contains lots of vitamin E which is good for the skin. However, almond milk is much lower in protein than normal milk and sugar is a primary ingredient, so choose unsweetened versions to get the best benefits.\nThe key thing about soya milk is that it contains the closest protein levels to normal milk – with 3g per 100ml. It is also rich in calcium and low in calories, but taste-wise is very sweet and can leave an after-taste. Soya milk is a great option for people trying to keep their cholesterol levels down as it has low saturated fat and is also suitable for those on a lactose-free diet.\nProtein content may be low in coconut milk, but this milk alternative is rich in added calcium and essential vitamins C, E B1, B3 B5 and B6. It is ideal for those with a sweet tooth as it has a strong, tangy taste of sweet coconut. However, with 2g of fat per 100ml, it is higher in fat than semi-skimmed milk.\nHemp milk is a relatively new addition to the alternative milk market, and although it is quite high in fat (2.5g per 100ml) and low in protein, it does provide half of your daily intake of omega-3 per glass. Good Hemp – which is available at Holland and Barrett – is made from a blend of pure hemp seed, water, grape juice, rice starch and seaweed and is completely sugar-free.\nRice Dream is a popular brand of rice milk, which is low in fat and fortified with calcium and vitamins D2 and B12. Protein and calcium content is unfortunately low, but calorie content is very similar to semi-skimmed normal milk. The flavour is light and slightly sweet, and it contains lots of antioxidants that are not found in other milk alternatives. Rice milk is ideal for those who don’t want to drink normal milk, but may have an allergy to soy or nuts.']	['<urn:uuid:a4c643d5-ab15-4255-a0b0-53d65c9b6b04>', '<urn:uuid:411a4cc6-4728-4e0e-8cd8-479714f1dc22>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	12	98	2497
5	diagnosis process alzheimer versus parkinson	Alzheimer's diagnosis requires a complete physical exam, mental function tests, and ruling out other causes through various tests like brain tumor and thyroid checks. In contrast, Parkinson's is diagnosed when a person shows two out of three primary motor symptoms (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia), along with supporting symptoms like small handwriting and reduced facial expression.	"[""Alzheimer diseaseSenile dementia - Alzheimer type (SDAT); SDAT; Dementia - Alzheimer\nDementia is a loss of brain function that occurs with certain diseases. Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. It affects memory, thinking, and behavior.\nThe exact cause of Alzheimer disease is not known. Research shows that certain changes in the brain lead to Alzheimer disease.\nYou are more likely to develop Alzheimer disease if you:\n- Are older -- Developing Alzheimer disease is not a part of normal aging.\n- Have a close relative, such as a brother, sister, or parent with Alzheimer disease.\n- Have certain genes linked to Alzheimer disease.\nThe following may also increase the risk:\n- Being female\n- Having heart and blood vessel problems due to high cholesterol\n- History of head trauma\nThere are two types of Alzheimer disease:\n- Early onset Alzheimer disease -- Symptoms appear before age 60. This type is much less common than late onset. It tends to get worse quickly. Early onset disease can run in families. Several genes have been identified.\n- Late onset Alzheimer disease -- This is the most common type. It occurs in people age 60 and older. It may run in some families, but the role of genes is less clear.\nAlzheimer disease symptoms include difficulty with many areas of mental function, including:\n- Emotional behavior or personality\n- Thinking and judgment (cognitive skills)\nAlzheimer disease usually first appears as forgetfulness.\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the stage between normal forgetfulness due to aging, and the development of Alzheimer disease. People with MCI have mild problems with thinking and memory that do not interfere with daily activities. They are often aware of the forgetfulness. Not everyone with MCI develops Alzheimer disease.\nSymptoms of MCI include:\n- Difficulty performing more than one task at a time\n- Difficulty solving problems\n- Forgetting recent events or conversations\n- Taking longer to perform more difficult activities\nEarly symptoms of Alzheimer disease can include:\n- Difficulty performing tasks that take some thought, but used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing complex games (bridge), and learning new information or routines\n- Getting lost on familiar routes\n- Language problems, such as trouble remembering the names of familiar objects\n- Losing interest in things previously enjoyed and being in a flat mood\n- Misplacing items\n- Personality changes and loss of social skills\nAs Alzheimer disease becomes worse, symptoms are more obvious and interfere with the ability to take care of oneself. Symptoms may include:\n- Change in sleep patterns, often waking up at night\n- Delusions, depression, and agitation\n- Difficulty doing basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, and driving\n- Difficulty reading or writing\n- Forgetting details about current events\n- Forgetting events in one's life history and losing self-awareness\n- Hallucinations, arguments, striking out, and violent behavior\n- Poor judgment and loss of ability to recognize danger\n- Using the wrong word, mispronouncing words, or speaking in confusing sentences\n- Withdrawing from social contact\nPeople with severe Alzheimer disease can no longer:\n- Recognize family members\n- Perform basic activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, and bathing\n- Understand language\nOther symptoms that may occur with Alzheimer disease:\n- Problems controlling bowel movements or urine\n- Swallowing problems\nExams and Tests\nA skilled health care provider can often diagnose Alzheimer disease with the following steps:\n- Performing a complete physical exam, including a nervous system exam\n- Asking about the person's medical history and symptoms\n- Mental function tests (mental status examination)\nA diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is made when certain symptoms are present, and by making sure other causes of dementia are not present.\nTests may be done to rule out other possible causes of dementia, including:\n- Brain tumor\n- Long-term (chronic) infection\n- Intoxication from medicines\n- Severe depression\n- Increased fluid on the brain (normal pressure hydrocephalus)\n- Thyroid disease\n- Vitamin deficiency\nThe only way to know for certain that someone has Alzheimer disease is to examine a sample of their brain tissue after death.\nThere is no cure for Alzheimer disease. The goals of treatment are:\n- Slow the progression of the disease (although this is difficult to do)\n- Manage symptoms, such as behavior problems, confusion, and sleep problems\n- Change the home environment to make daily activities easier\n- Support family members and other caregivers\nMedicines are used to:\n- Slow the rate at which symptoms worsen, though the benefit from using these drugs may be small\n- Control problems with behavior, such as loss of judgment or confusion\nBefore using these medicines, ask the provider:\n- What are the side effects? Is the medicine worth the risk?\n- When is the best time, if any, to use these medicines?\n- Do medicines for other health problems need to be changed or stopped?\nSomeone with Alzheimer disease will need support in the home as the disease gets worse. Family members or other caregivers can help by helping the person cope with memory loss and behavior and sleep problems. It is important to make sure the home of a person who has Alzheimer disease is safe for them.\nHaving Alzheimer disease or caring for a person with the condition may be a challenge. You can ease the stress of illness by seeking support through Alzheimer disease resources. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nHow quickly Alzheimer disease gets worse is different for each person. If Alzheimer disease develops quickly, it is more likely to worsen quickly.\nPeople with Alzheimer disease often die earlier than normal, although a person may live anywhere from 3 to 20 years after diagnosis.\nFamilies will likely need to plan for their loved one's future care.\nThe final phase of the disease may last from a few months to several years. During that time, the person becomes totally disabled. Death usually occurs from an infection or organ failure.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall the provider if:\n- Alzheimer disease symptoms develop or a person has a sudden change in mental status\n- The condition of a person with Alzheimer disease gets worse\n- You are unable to care for a person with Alzheimer disease at home\nAlthough there is no proven way to prevent Alzheimer disease, there are some measures that may help prevent or slow the onset of Alzheimer disease:\n- Stay on a low-fat diet and eat foods high in omega-3 fatty acids.\n- Get plenty of exercise.\n- Stay mentally and socially active.\n- Wear a helmet during risky activities to prevent brain injury.\nKnopman DS.

For some, a Parkinson’s diagnosis may mark the end of a long and frustrating search to explain a collection of different and seemingly disconnected symptoms. For others, a Parkinson’s diagnosis is a complete shock, filled with feelings of disbelief and despair. For everyone, a Parkinson’s diagnosis brings a new and unexpected journey.\nParkinson’s is not life-threatening, but it is progressive. This means that symptoms and effects of Parkinson’s will change and get worse over time. Parkinson’s is also very complex and can affect almost every part of the body, ranging from how you move to how you feel to how you think and process. When you are first diagnosed, the sheer amount of information and the uniqueness of each person’s experience of Parkinson’s can be incredibly overwhelming.\nIn this section, we help you navigate to the right information so you can get started on your path to living well with Parkinson’s.\nHow is Parkinson's diagnosed?\nSince no two cases of Parkinson’s are ever exactly alike, Parkinson’s can be very difficult to diagnose. Some people experience a journey of months and even years as they visit different specialists to determine what is causing early and often seemingly disconnected symptoms like constipation, depression, foot cramping or shoulder pain.\nPhysicians determine you have Parkinson’s after reviewing your medical history, self-reported symptoms and a clinical examination conducted by a neurologist or a movement disorder specialist.\nA Parkinson’s diagnosis requires you have two out of three primary motor symptoms:\n- Tremor (shaking, usually of the arm, leg or chin, while at rest)\n- Rigidity (stiffness)\n- Bradykinesia (slow movement)\nTo support the diagnosis, your healthcare provider will also look for other symptoms:\n- Micrographia (small handwriting)\n- Reduced facial expression (mask-like face)\n- Decreased arm swing or leg drag on one side of the body while walking\nSymptoms such as shoulder pain, depression, sleep problems, constipation and loss of sense of smell can begin long before any of the motor symptoms appear. Because symptoms like these can be subtle at first, they are not always evident or meaningful before diagnosis. It is common after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s to look back and realize symptoms had been coming on gradually for months or even years. Often people explore other treatment avenues for early symptoms, like physical therapy or even surgery for pain, only to discover later it was actually connected to Parkinson’s.\nSince doctors diagnose other medical conditions using sophisticated technology, many are surprised to learn a Parkinson’s diagnosis is based on your medical history and a simple examination. While your healthcare provider may take other steps, such as order blood and urine tests, check copper levels and order a brain scan, such as an MRI or CT or DaTscan that measures dopamine, these tests do not diagnose Parkinson’s disease. They are used to either confirm the diagnosis or determine if another medical condition is causing your symptoms.\nAt diagnosis, the doctor’s receptionist said, ‘Congratulations! You have the best incurable disease you can get.’ She was referring to the fact that there is so much life ahead yet to be lived; it’s not a death sentence. That moment set the tone for the course of my illness and how I choose to live my life. —Dennis (with wife Judy)\nSoon after diagnosis, you will begin exploring the wide range of treatments available to help manage symptoms of Parkinson’s. Since Parkinson’s looks different for everyone, no two treatment paths will be the same. Treatment typically includes some combination of medication, exercise and rehabilitation strategies like physical and speech therapy to manage symptoms and give you the best possible quality of life. Non-medical therapies are just as important as medication. These therapies can treat or prevent many symptoms affecting movement, speech and your ability to do daily life and work activities. Learn more about living well with Parkinson’s, which includes actions like regular exercise, eating a well-balanced, nutrient-rich diet and tending to your emotional, creative and spiritual needs.\nIn the last decade, research studies and clinical experience have upgraded the importance of exercise for people with Parkinson’s from a “nice to have” activity to an essential way to help manage symptoms and maintain quality of life. Exercise helps or even improves everything from your mood to your fatigue to muscle stiffness to tremor and constipation. Learn more about the research supporting the importance of exercise and how to start and continue an effective exercise program as you learn to live with Parkinson’s.\nThere are many different types of medications that can help manage symptoms of Parkinson’s. Medications often involve trial and error to find the combination that works for you, which will continue to change and evolve over time. Sometimes medications can impact other symptoms of Parkinson’s or cause frustrating side effects, so it is important to communicate closely with your doctor. Often adjusting the dosage or changing the medication can help. For more information, see medications and treatments.\nHow did I get Parkinson's and when did it start?\nWho Gets Parkinson’s?\nParkinson’s is second only to Alzheimer’s as the most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States, affecting between 1 million to 1.5 million Americans. There are more people living with Parkinson’s in the U.S. than the number of people living with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and Lou Gehrig’s disease (ALS) combined.\nAn estimated 50,000 to 60,000 new cases of Parkinson’s are reported annually in the U.S. alone. Between 7 and 10 million people are estimated to be living with Parkinson’s around the world.\nMost people living with Parkinson’s are older than 65 and about 60 percent are male. About 1 in 100 people over the age of 60 have Parkinson’s, while there are fewer than 1 in 1,000 people under the age of 50 living with Parkinson’s. 15% of people with Parkinson’s are under age 50 and only 5% are under age 40. Typically, individuals under the age of 50 and diagnosed with Parkinson’s are referred to as having young onset Parkinson’s disease (YOPD).\nThere is no known cause of Parkinson’s, nor have scientists identified a set of characteristics that accurately predict if someone will develop Parkinson’s. Discovering a biomarker, a biological characteristic that can predict if someone will develop a certain condition, is a current focus of ongoing research.\nWhat causes Parkinson’s?\nThe complexity of the brain has made the search for the underlying causes of Parkinson’s difficult. There is currently no known cause of Parkinson’s, though scientists and researchers believe a unique combination of genetics, environment, lifestyle and other factors are at play for each person who develops the disease.\nSome people with Parkinson’s may have a genetic connection and will often have someone else in their family with Parkinson’s. Others may point to specific environmental factors, such exposure to pesticides, or lifestyle factors, like head trauma, that they believe influenced their developing Parkinson’s.\nWhen does Parkinson’s Start?\nMany people live with Parkinson’s for years before being officially diagnosed. Early symptoms are called pre-motor symptoms and effects like constipation, depression and loss of smell can begin anywhere from a few months to multiple decades before a diagnosis or more visible motor symptoms like tremor appear. Looking back after diagnosis, some people can pinpoint the onset of their disease or recognize seemingly disconnected symptoms that in hindsight were really the start of what they can now identify as Parkinson’s symptoms.\nFor younger people with Parkinson’s or those without the more classic symptoms of tremor, rigidity (stiffness) and slow movement, the diagnosis can be more difficult and take longer to confirm.\nWhat is a Parkinson’s care team? Who should be on mine?\nParkinson’s is a complex, multifaceted disease that is not meant to be faced alone. Putting together a strong care team among your family and community, friends and mentors in the Parkinson’s community and various healthcare professionals will help you best manage symptoms and enjoy the best possible quality of life.\nA care team can range from your family members to your acupuncturist, and include just about everyone in between! Since Parkinson’s impacts each person so differently, your care team will be unique to you and it will change and evolve as your symptoms do the same. Healthcare providers, complementary therapy specialists and even emotional well-being professionals should all be considered as you evaluate who best fits on your personal care team.\nPhysical Healthcare Providers\nA neurologist specializes in conditions of the brain. He or she can confirm your diagnosis and establish an appropriate treatment plan.\nA movement disorder specialist is a neurologist with additional training in movement disorders. Movement disorder specialists are much more familiar with Parkinson’s disease and may be able to make a diagnosis sooner. They also know more about current research and treatment options and will recognize when to refer you to experts who can help address specific aspects of Parkinson’s, such as a sleep specialist for sleeping troubles and a speech and language therapist to improve your speech and swallowing. If you don’t have a movement disorder specialist close to home, seek out an empathetic neurologist who is experienced treating people with Parkinson’s and who will listen to you and your family, work with you to define your needs and goals and be open to your suggestions and ideas as an active participant in your own treatment plan. If your team doesn’t include a movement disorder specialist, you’ll want to be more informed and prepared to advocate for the treatment and services you need from healthcare providers not necessarily specialized in Parkinson’s.\nYour primary care physician (PCP) will also be very important over the coming years. He or she will help you stay healthy with regular check-ups and will complement your neurologist in treating non-motor symptoms. Your doctor will typically manage your medications and refer you to additional healthcare professionals as needed.\nOther routine medical providers like your optometrist, dentist and obstetrician/gynecologist for women will continue to be essential parts of your care team and should be informed about Parkinson’s as well as the symptoms you are experiencing.\nEstablishing a broader medical team early builds a network of specialists who will become familiar with you and your symptoms and be with you as things evolve over time. Connecting with rehabilitation specialists will be essential at all stages of Parkinson’s, even early on or when symptoms are mild. Rehabilitation specialists include physical therapists, speech therapists and occupational therapists. Your rehabilitation team can help prevent or delay problems, minimize the impact of symptoms and maintain daily functioning as Parkinson’s progresses.\nDepending on your symptoms, you may also consider adding other, more medically-based specialists to your care team. These could include a sleep specialist to assist with problems sleeping or a neuropsychologist to help with changes in how you think and process, such as making decisions or retrieving the right word in conversations.\nComplementary Therapy Providers\nComplementary therapies are intended to be used together with traditional, more medically-minded approaches to managing Parkinson’s symptoms. A nutritionist can help you be more intentional about your diet to ensure you are getting the right nutrients you need. There have been research studies demonstrating how acupuncture can help symptoms ranging from balance and walking to pain, fatigue and feelings of anxiety and depression, so you may consider adding an acupuncturist to your care team.\nSince exercise is so important for people living with Parkinson’s, your personal trainer or various exercise instructors, like your yoga or tai chi teacher or a boxing coach, can all be considered essential members of your care team.\nEmotional Well-Being Providers\nIn addition to your physical healthcare team and complementary therapy providers, professionals who focus on emotional health and well-being can be very helpful. Counselors, social workers and psychologists are trained to assess emotional difficulties and to work with you and your doctor to promote good mental health. They can help you cope and stay positive.\nThese professionals can also help you manage stress that can make Parkinson’s symptoms worse, causing additional strain on you and your family. They serve as guides, helping you to respond with resilience to changes you hadn’t anticipated. Professional support and guidance can help you and your family cope with the tough times when they come.\nWhat can I do to live well with Parkinson’s?\nSince Parkinson’s affects everyone differently, the specific ways you choose to live well will be unique and will change over time. However, a positive attitude, staying engaged in your own health, consistently exercising and making a commitment to take action are steps everyone living with Parkinson’s can take to live well right now.\nResearch and personal experience of people living with Parkinson’s continue to show the incredible impacts simple lifestyle changes like stress reduction, getting enough sleep, a healthy diet rich in nutrients and exercise can have on not just your quality of life, but the actual experience of Parkinson’s symptoms like tremor, depression and fatigue. Research also suggests exercise may even help protect the areas of the brain affected by Parkinson’s from getting worse (a phenomenon known as neuroprotection), which may slow the progression of Parkinson’s.\nHere are some overall tips to take action after being diagnosed to live well with Parkinson’s:\n- Listen. Start to pay more attention to your body and report any changes to your healthcare team. Listen also to family and friends who may see changes in you.\n- Think holistically. Holistic health means that you look at the whole body and take an integrated approach. Every part of you is connected to and influenced by the other parts of you, so it is important to address Parkinson’s through the whole picture of lifestyle, diet, exercise stress management, relationships and personal and spiritual care and growth.\n- Be informed. Learn how personal and lifestyle habits can impact the symptoms of Parkinson’s. The more you know about the disease, the more empowered you’ll feel to form useful habits to combat your symptoms. For instance, physical activity is important at all stages of Parkinson’s. However, a regular exercise program will take time and energy from other aspects of your life. Knowing which activities to keep or eliminate will maximize the positive impact of the choices you can control.\n- Be prepared. Organize your healthcare documents and other information important to your medical team. Prepare for your medical appointments in order to get the best results from your time with the doctor.\n- Be your own best advocate. Ask for a referral to a rehabilitation therapist if you haven’t received one. Talk with your healthcare team about your goals and concerns. Make them aware of areas you want to improve. For instance, if using a keyboard has become difficult, ask your doctor about strategies to improve hand function. If you seek treatment early and are specific about symptoms or problems that are making everyday life frustrating, you’ll help your doctor tailor the most effective treatment plan for you.\n- Prioritize the symptoms you can change. This may mean taking medicines on time to limit symptoms or beginning rehabilitative therapy to improve posture or volume of your voice. It will mean starting or renewing your commitment to daily exercise and may also include changing your lifestyle to promote overall health by losing weight, stopping smoking and eating a healthy diet.\n- Learn to live with the symptoms you can’t change. Although a combination of medications, complementary therapies and lifestyle changes will help you manage Parkinson’s symptoms, symptoms will still show up in different ways in your life. Start to learn different ways to live with the reality of symptoms as you manage them or ways to manage those symptoms that may be less responsive to the various therapies. For instance, if a bothersome tremor doesn’t always respond to medications, try reducing the anxiety that can make tremor worse. Practicing deep breathing relaxation techniques and intentionally reduce stress as other ways to help manage tremor.\n- Be engaged. Seek out support from people with whom you feel comfortable sharing your thoughts and concerns. Your support system may include people you trust, such as specific family members, friends or individuals from church or work. Support groups can be helpful, as are group exercise classes and gathering with small groups of other people living with Parkinson’s who encourage and inspire you.\n- Stay positive. A positive attitude keeps the focus on what you can do, not what you can’t. It fosters hope. If you’re having a bad day, search for unique daily victories and remember tomorrow will bring another opportunity to live well.\n- Learn about clinical research trials that may be available to people with early Parkinson’s. Many researchers seek to understand the impact of medicines in early disease before any other medicine has been started, and they are always looking for participants. Another especially important area of research is the study of neuroprotective or therapies that can slow or potentially even stop the progression of Parkinson’s. While participating in a research trial is not for everyone, you may be empowered by participating in the latest research and by potentially advancing the science of Parkinson’s for the greater community.

6	data driven company performance tracking methodologies finance dashboard integration	Data-driven company performance tracking combines financial monitoring and visual analytics approaches. At the foundational level, companies need to maintain regular tracking of key numbers through a company snapshot, which includes current assets, liabilities, monthly sales, inventory levels, and outstanding loans. This provides quick insights into cash position, receivables status, and sales performance. To enhance this tracking, Power BI dashboards can be implemented to create interactive visualizations of these metrics. The dashboard should be designed with a clear purpose, minimal clutter, appropriate visualizations, and contextual information. It's essential to make these tools accessible across devices and keep them simple enough for quick comprehension while providing enough detail for meaningful analysis.	"[""Managing Your Numbers Is Essential for Growth\nDo you want to do everything you possibly can to ensure the survival and growth of your company? Of course you do. Well, one of the most essential skills that you can bring to your company is understanding, tracking, and using certain numbers.\nThis numeracy--thinking in numbers--is a vital, vital skill.\nLet me explain. In my experience, far too many people feel that they aren't good at math, or didn't take accounting, or whatever. Using this as an excuse, they hire someone else to watch the numbers for them. This is two mistakes in one. First, they're selling themselves short. Anybody can work with numbers, and the kind of number-tracking I'm talking about requires no advanced mathematical training or professional degree. Second, there's no substitute for you in this process. Nobody else out there is as motivated as you are to get the numbers working on behalf of your business.\nYes, your accountant can prepare your P&L statements, tax returns, and balance sheet and offer certain kinds of advice based on rules-of-thumb and industry norms. (By the way, an accountant with lots of experience working with companies like yours can be a gold mine of comparative information.) But you simply can't count on quarterly meetings with your accountant. In order to run your company properly, and dramatically reduce your risk of failure, you need to get access to certain numbers quickly, and use those numbers effectively.\nHere are the numbers you should have at your fingertips:\n- a snapshot of the company,\n- cash flow statements that are regularly updated,\n- cost analysis of your product(s),\n- break-even analyses, both for the company overall and for each new product.\nHere I will only discuss the snapshot of the company. My goal is to get you comfortable with these numbers--by which I don't simply mean that you'll be able to generate them, but that you'll understand them and be able to adapt and use them effectively. In general, my prescription is, Know and love these numbers! Note, I am not saying you have to prepare the snapshot yourself. When you're small, you can have your accountant or bookkeeper prepare them for you; and if your company grows to the point that you can afford a chief financial officer, then she will take responsibility for preparing the numbers.\nI call the following chart the Company Snapshot because I want to convey the idea that it's quick to read and absorb. I've done it weekly because that's been the interval that's proven most helpful to me in my businesses. One manufacturing company I've worked with does a similar report daily. Depending on the nature of your business, you might find a bi-weekly report adequate, particularly during slow seasons. In certain situations--for example, where your company is temporarily flush with cash--you may decide that a monthly snapshot is adequate. But you can't make that decision until you understand the snapshot, and how your company performs against that snapshot. So my advice is start weekly, and adjust as necessary.\nThe snapshot is meant to be simple. It's meant to be easy to prepare--your secretary or bookkeeper should be able to do it--and able to be digested by you in no more than five minutes. Depending on the specifics of your business, you may want to add or subtract categories from the following exhibit. You might also want to use comparatives from a prior period. Just remember: Keep it simple.\nCurrent assets: ______________________\nCash, reg: ______________________\nLiquid assets: ______________________\nInventory (if a product company): ______________________\nCurrent liabilities: ______________________\nAccrued commissions: ______________________\nAccrued royalties: ______________________\nFixed monthly expenses: ______________________\nLoans outstanding: ______________________\nMonthly sales to date: ______________________\nYearly sales to date: ______________________\nFuture orders to ship: ______________________\nOpen purchase orders: ______________________\nThe point of this report is to get the quickest possible handle on key aspects of your company's operation, such as:\n- Do I have enough cash to pay my bills? (You may notice that you're cash challenged because your fixed monthly expenses seem to be too high. This should trigger you to start thinking about cutting some expenses or converting some to variable expenses.)\n- Are my receivables running too high? (If so, is it because payments are\nrunning late? Or is it because my credit-checking system has fallen apart, and we're selling more non-credit-worthy customers?)\n- Do I have enough inventory to handle future demand? (A caveat: This report\ncan't tell you if you have the inventory in the right categories; only a detailed inventory report can tell you that.)\n- Have we overcommitted ourselves in terms of inventory? (Most companies hit this stumbling block sooner or later. If your inventory figure is too high, it's a signal that you need to get the kind of detailed report that would let you take the right immediate action--such as canceling existing product orders, heading off the placement of future orders, putting certain items on sale, or closing out certain items.)\n- Are my sales on target as to projections? If not, why and what corrective actions need to be initiated?\nStarting and growing a business can have you in chasing-your-tail mode with not enough time in the day to do everything. While you deal with this syndrome, you must always keep an eye on your numbers. This snapshot is meant to help you do so in a minimum amount of time. It will help you prevent crises by spotting them before they materialize. Most business failures are attributed to running out of cash. Let's avoid that."", 'A dashboard is a visual representation of key performance indicators (KPIs) that provide insights into business performance. With the increasing amount of data being generated by businesses, it is essential to present this data in a way that is easy to understand and use. This is where Power BI dashboards come in.\nPower BI is a business analytics service that provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities. It allows users to create and share dashboards that provide insights into their business performance. However, creating an effective Power BI dashboard requires careful planning and design. In this blog post, we will explore some best practices and tips for designing effective Power BI dashboards.\n1. Define the Purpose of the Dashboard\nThe first step in designing an effective Power BI dashboard is to define its purpose. What insights do you want to gain from the dashboard? Who will be using the dashboard? What actions do you want users to take based on the insights provided by the dashboard?\nDefining the purpose of the dashboard helps you determine what KPIs to include, how to visualize them, and how to organize the dashboard. It also helps ensure that the dashboard is relevant and useful to its intended audience.\n2. Keep it Simple\nOne of the key principles of dashboard design is to keep it simple. Too much information or clutter can overwhelm users and make it difficult to identify the most important insights. Keep the number of visuals and KPIs to a minimum and use a clean and uncluttered design.\nUse color sparingly and only for emphasis. Avoid using too many different colors, as this can make the dashboard look chaotic. Stick to a consistent color palette to create a unified look and feel.\n3. Use Visualizations Effectively\nPower BI provides a wide range of visualizations, from simple tables and charts to more complex visuals like maps and gauges. However, not all visualizations are equally effective in conveying insights.\nChoose visualizations that are appropriate for the data being presented and that effectively convey the insights you want to communicate. Use charts and graphs to show trends over time or comparisons between different KPIs. Use maps to visualize geographic data, and gauges to show progress towards a goal.\n4. Provide Context\nContext is essential for understanding the insights provided by a dashboard. Provide context for each KPI by including a brief description of what it represents and how it is calculated. Use text boxes to provide additional information and context where necessary.\n5. Make it Interactive\nPower BI dashboards provide users with the ability to interact with the data and explore it in more detail. Use features like drill-down and filtering to allow users to focus on specific data points and explore trends and patterns.\n6. Ensure it is Responsive\nMore and more users are accessing dashboards on mobile devices, so it is essential to ensure that your Power BI dashboard is responsive and can be viewed on a range of devices. Use responsive design principles to ensure that the dashboard layout adjusts to the size of the screen and that the visualizations are still easy to read and understand.\nPower BI dashboards provide users with powerful insights into business performance. However, designing an effective dashboard requires careful planning and design. By following these best practices and tips, you can create a dashboard that is simple, easy to use, and provides users with the insights they need to make informed decisions.\nIn summary, when designing a Power BI dashboard, it is important to define the purpose of the dashboard, keep it simple, use visualizations effectively, provide context, make it interactive, and ensure it is responsive. By following these best practices and tips, you can create a dashboard that is visually appealing, informative, and easy to use.']"	['<urn:uuid:3940829a-20ce-4480-94f1-010e221590d0>', '<urn:uuid:4f589075-631f-4695-837f-fc296d0b8bb5>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	9	109	1559
7	I've been dealing with depression and recently started coughing up blood when stressed. What does this mean for my health, and how should both conditions be treated?	Coughing up blood (hemoptysis) is not a normal symptom of stress or depression and requires immediate medical attention. According to medical experts, if everyone who was stressed coughed up blood, we would all be covered in blood. This symptom needs proper medical evaluation, including at minimum a chest x-ray and examination of your throat and nose. For depression treatment, research shows the most effective approach combines multiple methods: Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which has been proven effective in numerous studies, regular exercise, proper sleep hygiene, and potentially medication as an adjunct treatment. Both conditions need to be evaluated and treated separately by appropriate healthcare professionals, as they are distinct medical issues requiring different treatment approaches.

He arranged with Pathé-Marconi to press the discs at their Paris plant, making him the first to introduce microgroove into French popular music.	"['Born Eduard Ruault in Paris, he was the son of a café waiter father, while his mother worked for the post office. In the late 1920s, his parents were able to take over a large bar, Café de la Poste, facing the Gare de Lyon. Although Eduard and his brother spent some of their infancy in the Taverny suburb with their grandmother, at 15 his parents had removed him from school and put him to work in the café. As he later recalled, he had been a lazy student, and he learned a good deal more behind the bar than he had managed at school.\nA self-taught musician, he was devoted to the playing of Fats Waller, and his style was good enough that he was engaged to be bar pianist at a club called L\'Étape in rue Godot-de-Maury. He alternated half-hour sets every evening with another beginner, Louis de Funès, later one of the top stage and film stars in France. Whenever he could, Eduard went to the Hot Club de France to hear Stéphane Grappelli, Django Reinhardt and their quintet.\nWith the second world war, the fall of France and the German occupation, jazz was banned by the Nazis, and a group of friends would meet in Eduard\'s room over the bar to listen to jazz records, or tune in to clandestine radio stations. Pierre-Louis Guérin, later the proprietor of Le Lido, gave Eduard another job as pianist, at his first nightspot, Le Club.\nAfter the liberation in 1944, and with the fashion for American music, he changed his name to Eddie Barclay. With Eddie\'s Club, he claimed to have launched the first discothèque and in 1947 started his own band, with a line-up including Harry Cooper on trumpet, Jean-Pierre Sasson on electric guitar and Bobby Guidott on bass. The vocalist was Eddie\'s second wife, Nicole, who called herself Eve Williams - his first marriage, in 1945, to Michèle, doesn\'t rate a mention in his autobiography, Que la Fête Continue.\nIt was with Nicole\'s help that Eddie was able to launch his first label, Blue Star - this was still the era of 78 rpm discs. They kept the stock in their flat, and distributed it from the back of his scooter. Their first successes were with records by Renée Lebas, Eddy Constantine and Don Byas.\nA s well as directing his band, Barclay also co-wrote songs, including Le Rock de Monsieur Failair, with Boris Vian, and Quand tu m\'embrasses, with Charles Aznavour, later recorded by Josephine Baker. Barclay composed several film scores, including Jean-Pierre Melville\'s classic gangster thriller Bob le Flambeur (1955). Vian, the great French poet of jazz, played sometimes with the band, and Eddie helped him edit the first important French publication dedicated to their subject, Jazz Magazine.\nOne of the American jazz enthusiasts who had come to Eddie\'s Club was Alan Morrison, and in 1952 he urged the Barclays to come to the US to see the new revolution in recording, microgroove 45s and 33 rpm LPs. Eddie made a deal with Mercury Records, and he returned to France with 60 masters. An arrangement with Pathé-Marconi to be allowed to press the discs at their Paris plant gave him a head start, and soon he had launched the microgroove into French popular music. He was able to issue many great American records for the first time in France, including albums by Ray Charles, Dizzy Gillespie, Sammy Davis Jnr and Duke Ellington. Barclay found a studio in rue Hoche and engaged a German sound engineer, Gerhard Lehner, whom Barclay credited with making all his best discs.\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s he discovered talent. The Egyptian beauty queen Dalida was launched by him in 1956, but his greatest coup was to lure three top singer-composers: Charles Aznavour, who stayed 22 years; Léo Ferré, who recorded some of his greatest songs, including Avec le Temps and Jolie Môme; and Jacques Brel, who deserted Philips to join Barclay in 1962. The Dutch company threatened to sue, but it was settled out of court, and Barclay agreed to let go a young singer he had under contract: Johnny Hallyday.\nBarclay\'s friendship with Brel was sometimes stormy, but he gave the composer artistic freedom. For several years Brel abandoned singing, but towards the end of his life he made a final LP. He asked for no pre-publication hype, but, taking advantage of this, Barclay staged a magnificent launch. One million copies of the disc were pressed, and these were distributed to shops and radio stations in locked boxes. On release day, the code of the lock was announced, and the discs set free. The album sold 650,000 copies on the first day.\nThe list of singers who recorded for Barclay is a roll-call of some of the greatest names of those days: Henri Salvador, Juliette Gréco, Jean Ferrat, Claude Nougaro, Cora Vaucaire, Michel Sardou, Frank Alamo, Mireille Mathieu - and Brigitte Bardot, who cut Nue au Soleil.\nIt was Bardot who first introduced Barclay to Saint Tropez in the late 1950s, and encouraged him to buy a plot of land nearby. He took 25 years to build a house, but once installed he made it the venue for parties that were the delight of the paparazzi; indeed they seemed to be designed as much for the press as for the guests.\nAfter Brel died in 1978, and Barclay himself had survived treatment for throat cancer, he sold his record label to Polygram, although he retained a 20% interest. He later launched another label, but the great days were past. For the last two decades of his life, it was parties, and a procession of young brides, that occupied his energies. The Mayor of Neuilly, at his fifth or sixth wedding said: ""Ah, Bonjour, Monsieur Barclay, what a pleasure to see you yet again.""\nBarclay said that although his life was dominated by love and friendship, his fidelity was reserved for his colleagues, and it was working with artists that had brought him his most profound happiness. When he talked about his lavish parties, it wasn\'t the food or the fancy dress that he remembered, but the impromptu performances from his real friends, the musicians.\nHe is survived by his wife Tiare, and his son Guillaume from his third marriage.\n· Eddie Barclay (Eduard Ruault), record producer and entrepreneur, born January 26 1921; died May 13 2005']"	['<urn:uuid:e81a0185-12a3-4e2d-8c90-6a802a25d44d>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	8	46	1067
9	droplet contact precautions vs routine cleaning differences	Droplet/contact precautions require more stringent protocols compared to routine cleaning. For droplet/contact scenarios, healthcare workers must wear fluid resistant masks with visors, gowns, and gloves for all direct patient care within 2 meters, especially for cases like influenza or vomiting. In contrast, routine home cleaning focuses on removing unwanted matter and germs from surfaces, particularly in kitchens, bathrooms and high-touch areas, without requiring the same level of personal protective equipment. Both approaches emphasize hand hygiene, but droplet/contact precautions have additional specific requirements for PPE use and disposal.	"['NO, it can’t. Why? The definition of “clean” as it relates to your home is “the absence of unwanted matter”1. If there is a desirable benefit to dirt or soil, then it is not “unwanted”.\n“Unwanted matter” is empty pizza boxes, soda cans and bottles. You get the idea. There is no sound argument for them decorating your home. Sorry. It is also soil (dirt and oils) that can cause excessive wear on carpet and hard surface floors. The grit in the soil can scratch and ruin surfaces. Oil traps soil in carpet.\nThen, there are germs. Yes, there are good and bad germs. Bad ones are called pathogens. They are alive. They communicate with each other. They are designed to stay alive by defending themselves against threats, including chemicals. One defense they use is their formation of biofilm. Biofilm is often made up of many types of pathogens2. They can include bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi.\nThe major surfaces where you do not want germs are kitchens, bathrooms and high touch areas3. Foodborne illness in the home often comes from cross-contamination while preparing a meal. Bathrooms harbor bad germs too. Mold and fungus frequently cause illness and are not easy to kill or remove completely. Most people who get sick from this source do not realize or appreciate how or why they are ill. Other germs are transmitted from people. Avoid sharing towels and cloths. If someone has been in the hospital, it is highly suggested that they have exclusive use of a bathroom for a time when recuperating at home.\nChemical disinfectants and biocides are regulated solutions that are designed to kill germs4. They do not know the difference between good and bad germs. To protect you and your home it is not always necessary to kill germs. Germs can be removed from a surface and disposed of in a sewer or trash container. Germs can be killed without chemicals that can harm you or your home. Some ways this can be done is with heat, light and ozone. Ozone generators are dangerous, highly corrosive and recommended for professional use only and should never be used when people, pets or plants are present5.\nChemical solutions are appropriate in some cases to restore the “clean condition” to a home. There may be a need to remove chemical residues after killing germs or pests. Bombing a roach infested home is one example of this. No, roaches are never “wanted”! They excrete an endotoxin that can cause illness in humans6.\nSome chemicals are frequently confused as cleaning solutions. Bleach is one example. Bleach does not clean7. It oxidizes or corrodes. It kills and is regulated as a biocide. Which kills everything, this is not good, a too sterile environment leads to multiple allergies, and a weakened immune system and homemade solutions can be very risky. Tests using vinegar and lemons have shown these recipes do kill many germs, but not enough. There are other factors to consider when using chemicals such as “dwell time” or sit time8. To do their job, chemicals must be in contact with germs. They must be kept wet and allowed to react with the germs. This can take up to 10 minutes. A great way to remember this is when you eat out and watch your table being cleaned just before you sit down. Have you ever seen anyone let the chemical solution sit for even 3 minutes? Keep your tableware on your plate or napkin!\nThere is a place and time to be in dirt. Dirt and rich soil of the earth has many healthful benefits. Studies show working and playing in the dirt allows you to touch and breathe positive beneficial organisms9. They help protect you from negative pathogens and build your immune system. Working and playing in the dirt with bare hands or feet has been shown to benefit the electrical activity in humans. Helping the body to be more balanced, and transition into a more relaxed state. With all these positive effects, this does not mean it is a good idea to bring a bucket of dirt in the house and let the kids dump it on the floor.\nYES. Dirt is good for you. Just not in the house!\n5 ITEMS YOU TO KNOW FOR YOUR CLEAN HOME\n- Understand the definition of “clean” for your home. This means realizing that there are germs inside your home that are a dangerous threat to you and your loved ones. A single person who travels and never cooks at home has different needs than a family of four with a cat and a dog.\n- Based on your needs, establish a cleaning routine. Emphasis should be placed on kitchens, bathrooms and high touch surfaces like doorknobs. Some surfaces may require cleaning daily.\n- Do not share personal items like towels, razors or brushes.\n- Use cleaning solutions and disinfectants (biocides) responsibly. Many dangerous germs can be removed from a surface into the sewer. When using any disinfectant always follow the label directions. Follow the dwell or sit time instructions.\n- Spend time in the dirt. Outside. Plant something. Take a walk barefoot. Let your kids play outside in the dirt. Have some limits. Muddy shoes on the sectional sofa is not a good idea.\nABOUT THE AUTHORS\nDavid Kiser is a Founding Member and Past President of the Association of Residential Cleaning Services International (ARCSI).

10	pregnancy complications breech birth fluid levels	Pregnancies can be complicated by both breech positioning and abnormal amniotic fluid levels. When a baby is breech (bottom-first position), it poses delivery risks and often requires cesarean section. Abnormal amniotic fluid levels can contribute to breech positioning and cause additional complications. Too much fluid (polyhydramnios) can cause breathing difficulties and belly tightness, while too little fluid (oligohydramnios) can lead to membrane rupture before labor and sudden drops in heart rate. Regular monitoring and proper hydration are essential, as maintaining optimal amniotic fluid levels may help prevent or manage breech positioning.	"[""What is a breech birth?\nRight before birth, most babies are in a head-down position in the mother's uterus, which is why most babies are born head first. Sometimes the baby is in a bottom-first (or feet-first) position. When a baby is in that position before birth, it's called a breech birth or breech baby. Many babies are breech early in pregnancy, but most of them turn to the headfirst position near the end of the pregnancy. Babies who are born early are more likely to be breech. If more than one baby is in the uterus at a time, one or more of the babies may be breech. Abnormal levels of amniotic fluid around the baby may result in a breech birth. As you get closer to your due date, your doctor will be able to tell (by physical exam, ultrasound or both) if your baby is breech.\nCan a breech baby be delivered without a cesarean?\nAlthough breech babies can be delivered vaginally, it's generally safer and easier to deliver babies head first from the vagina. Some breech babies may be safely delivered from the vagina.\nMore complications can occur if the baby is breech. A baby who is breech may be very small, or it may have birth defects that are caused by a breech delivery. When breech babies are delivered vaginally, they are more likely to be injured during or after delivery than babies who are delivered head first. Breech babies who are delivered vaginally are also more likely to develop a birth defect where the baby’s hip socket and the thighbone become separated. Complications with the umbilical cord are also more likely in breech babies who are delivered vaginally (for example, the umbilical cord is more likely to be compressed during delivery, which can cause nerve and brain damage due to lack of oxygen).\nDoctors usually deliver breech babies by cesarean delivery (also called a C-section). Risks are also involved with cesarean delivery (such as bleeding, infection and longer hospital stays for both the mother and her baby).\nCan I do anything to help if my baby is breech?\nIt's very important to see your doctor regularly throughout your pregnancy. Your doctor can tell if your baby is breech and help plan what to do. Some doctors will plan to deliver the baby by cesarean section. Others may give their patients exercises to do at home that may help turn the baby to the head-first position. Some doctors try to turn the baby in the mother's uterus using a procedure called external cephalic version. If this procedure is successful and the baby stays head down, a normal vaginal delivery is more likely.\nWhat is external cephalic version?\nExternal cephalic version is a way to try to turn a baby from breech position to head-down position while it's still in the mother's uterus. In other words, external cephalic version means turning the baby from outside of the abdomen so that it's in the head-down position. Your doctor will use his or her hands on the outside of your abdomen to try to turn the baby.\nWhen is external cephalic version done?\nExternal cephalic version is done at the end of pregnancy, after about 37 weeks of gestation.\nWho can have external cephalic version?\nMany women who have normal pregnancies may have external cephalic version. Women who cannot have it are women who have one of the following:\n- Vaginal bleeding\n- A placenta that is near or covering the opening of the uterus\n- A nonreactive nonstress test\n- An abnormally small baby\n- A low level of fluid in the sac that surrounds and protects the baby\n- An abnormal fetal heart rate\n- Premature rupture of the membranes\n- Twins or other multiple pregnancy\nWhat are the risks of external cephalic version?\nExternal cephalic version has some risks, including the following:\n- Premature labor\n- Premature rupture of the membranes\n- A small blood loss for either the baby or the mother\n- Fetal distress leading to an emergency cesarean delivery\n- The baby might turn back to the breech position after the external cephalic version is done\nAlthough the risk of having these complications is small, some doctors prefer not to try an external cephalic version.\nWhat can I expect if my doctor and I decide to try external cephalic version?\nExternal cephalic version is usually done in the hospital. Before the procedure, you will have an ultrasound to confirm that the baby is breech. Your doctor will also do a nonstress test to make sure that the baby's heart rate is normal. A tube of blood will be drawn and an anesthesiologist will be notified (just in case you need to have an emergency cesarean delivery). You'll be given medicine through a vein in your arm to relax the muscles in your uterus. This medicine is very safe, with no risk to your baby. While you're lying down, the doctor will place his or her hands on the outside of your abdomen. After locating the baby's head, the doctor will gently try to turn the baby to the head-first position.\nWhat happens after the procedure?\nWhen the procedure is completed, your doctor will perform another nonstress test. If everything is normal, you won't have to stay in the hospital. If the procedure is not successful, your doctor will talk to you about the possibility of having a vaginal delivery or a cesarean section right away. Your doctor may also suggest repeating the external cephalic version.\nWhat is the success rate of external cephalic version?\nThe average success rate is about 65%. Even if the procedure works at first, there's still a chance that the baby will turn back around to the breech position. The success rate of external cephalic version depends on several factors, including the following:\n- How close you are to your due date\n- How much fluid is around the baby\n- How many pregnancies you've had\n- How much your baby weighs\n- How the placenta is positioned\n- How your baby is positioned\nWritten by familydoctor.org editorial staff"", 'What is amniotic fluid?\nIn the beautiful journey of pregnancy, when you are carrying your baby in the womb, she/he rests inside an amniotic sac filled with amniotic fluid.\nAmniotic fluid during pregnancy has many important functions and is crucial for healthy fetal development.\nAmniotic fluid is a clear, yellow fluid that surrounds the growing baby in the uterus, and is responsible for various tasks in this time.\nYou must be wondering about how does amniotic fluid keep your baby healthy?\nIt prevents the fetus from injuries and protects your baby from infections, as it contains antibodies while giving him/her room to move around and grow.\nThe amniotic fluid consists of necessary components such as nutrients, hormones, and infection-fighting antibodies that protect your baby in the uterus.\nHowever, if the amount of amniotic fluid inside the uterus is too much or too less, complications in pregnancy can occur.\nGenerally, the level of amniotic fluid is at its highest when it is around 36 weeks of pregnancy. This level decreases as the delivery date comes near.\nAmniotic fluid levels differ from person to person. The amount of amniotic fluid inside your uterus should be monitored as it may result in abnormal fetal development or lead to complications.\nToo much amniotic fluid causes Polyhydramnios, whereas too little amniotic fluid causes Oligohydramnios. Symptoms and signs of these vary from person to person.\nThe reasons behind Polyhydramnios are not clearly identified, but have a look at some known causes:\n- Maternal diabetes is one of the major causes of Polyhydramnios.\n- A possibility of twins is the other one. In this case, there is a complication in pregnancy wherein one twin receives too much blood and other is left with too little.\n- Shortage of red blood cells in the baby.\n- A possibility of infection during pregnancy leads to Polyhydramnios.\nCommon Polyhydramnios symptoms are :\n- Difficulty in breathing\n- Swelling in the lower extremities\n- Swelling of the vulva\n- Decrease in urine\n- Tightness in the belly\nCommon Oligohydramnios symptoms are\n- Extra Leakage of the amniotic fluid.\n- Less maternal weight gain.\n- Abdominal discomfort.\n- A sudden drop in heart rate.\n- Rupture of membranes before labour.\nHere are some tips that will help you increase the amount of amniotic fluid during pregnancy:\n1. Drinking an ample amount of water\nThis is one of the easiest ways to increase amniotic fluid. Increasing the level of water in your body also increases the level of amniotic fluid. Keeping your body hydrated is most important in all stages of pregnancy.\nHigh water-content foods like cucumber, strawberries, watermelon and tomatoes should be added in the diet on your platter.\n2. A big no to alcohol\nStop drinking alcohol. Alcohol is not considered good while you are pregnant, as it’s not good for your baby’s health. Alcohol dehydrates while lowering the level of amniotic fluid in your body. It is one of the things that you strictly avoid during pregnancy.\n3. Regular workouts\nPregnancy exercises are considered the best to stay stress-free, active and for maintaining a better circulation of blood. Regular workouts during pregnancy help in circulating the blood to various parts of the body. The increase in blood flow in the uterus also increases the level of amniotic fluid during pregnancy.\nHere are a few tips that will help you decrease the amount of amniotic fluid during pregnancy:\n1. Treating your disease right\nSometimes, any diseases you have can lead to an increase in the amount of amniotic fluid. Treating your disease right with proper consultation of doctors helps in lowering the level of amniotic fluid.\n2. Reduction of amniocentesis\nAmniocentesis drains out the excess amniotic fluid from your body. In this process, doctors draw fluid from the womb with proper techniques and procedures.\n3. Proper medication\nIf the amniotic fluid leakage is in excess then the doctor may put you on Indomethacin medication. It helps in reducing amniotic fluid levels. Doctors generally put you on indomethacin 31 weeks before delivery.\nAn excessive amount of amniotic fluid or too less amniotic fluid can be dangerous for you and your baby. Too much amniotic fluid in the womb causes polyhydramnios whereas too little amniotic fluid in the womb causes oligohydramnios.\nWomen with a lower or higher than average level of amniotic fluid during pregnancy may experience complications for their fetus and other problems during delivery.\nProper care is required in both cases. An optimal level of amniotic fluid is requisite for the well-being of both the mother and child. Make sure to get your amniotic fluid level checked for a safe pregnancy.']"	['<urn:uuid:ded38970-24e8-42b0-bb9a-3e49c47316cb>', '<urn:uuid:9210a069-b0f4-4668-8b64-99f1ebd1f4ae>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	6	91	1791
11	foreign worker documentation requirements enforcement	Foreign workers' documentation requirements involve two key aspects. First, under the H-2A visa program, workers must receive a written work agreement in their language containing details about contract period, work location, hours, wages, and conditions. Second, employers must be careful not to violate the Immigration and Nationality Act when verifying work eligibility - they cannot request specific documents from non-citizens or additional documents that aren't required of U.S. citizens. Employers who violate these requirements face DOJ penalties, as demonstrated by recent settlements with United General Bakery ($45,000) and McDonald's ($82,000). They must also implement non-discrimination policies and train HR personnel on proper verification procedures.	['The United States H-2A visa program allows U.S. companies and employers to employ foreign agricultural workers on a temporary basis. All workers admitted to the U.S. under the H-2A visa are guaranteed certain rights regarding wages, housing, workplace safety, and other requirements. Let’s take a closer look at employee rights under the H-2A visa program.\nWhat is the H-2A Visa program?\nThe H-2A visa program grants temporary work visas to agricultural laborers so that they can live and work in the U.S. on behalf of a U.S. company or employer. Here is a brief overview of the process employers must undergo in order to obtain an H-2A visa:\n- Submit an agricultural work order with a State Workforce Agency (SWA)\n- Initiate recruitment of U.S. agricultural workers\n- File an H-2A application with the Chicago National Processing Center (NPC)\n- Complete the Temporary Labor Certification Process\n- The U.S. Department of Labor grants a temporary labor certificate to the employer\n- The employer then completes Form I-129 with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\nUpon approval, the employer can then offer work contracts to foreign nationals, who then use that work agreement to file for an H-2A visa.\nWho qualifies for an H-2A Visa?\nTo qualify for an H-2A visa, the term of work must be less than one year. While an H-2A visa can be extended for longer than a year, the maximum period of time a worker can stay in the U.S. on an H-2A visa is three years.\nAs seen here, the H-2A visa is only open to nationals of specific eligible countries, determined by the Department of Homeland Security. The applicant must also have a work agreement from their employer, and meet the qualifications for entry as set by Customs and Border Patrol and the Department of Homeland Security.\nAn H-2A worker may also bring their spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 to live in the U.S. Note however, family members who are eligible for an H-4 visa cannot work while in the United States.\nWhat are H-2A employee rights?\nThe Department of Labor and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration guarantee several rights to H-2A employees. Here is an overview of employee rights and employer obligations under the H-2A visa program:\n- Rates of pay. All H-2A workers are covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and must be paid the highest of one of the following rates:\n- The Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR);\n- The applicable prevailing wage;\n- The agreed-upon collective bargaining rate; or\n- The Federal or State minimum wage.\n- While rates may be hourly or “piece” rate, a piece rate must be no less than the prevailing rate, and the total amount paid each pay period must average out to at least the highest required wage above.\n- Employees must be paid at least twice a month\n- Guarantees to all workers. All H-2A workers are entitled to the “three-fourths guarantee.” This means that every employee is guaranteed to earn at least 75% of the total amount of the contract, even if the employer does not offer sufficient work days/hours to reach that amount.\n- For example, if a worker has a 10-week contract to work 6 days a week and 8 hours a day, the contract promises them 480 hours. Therefore, the employer is required to pay them for at least 75%, or 360 hours, even if the employee actually works fewer than 360 hours over the 10 weeks.\n- Housing. If H-2A employees and other agricultural workers cannot be reasonably expected to return home at night, the employer must provide housing at no cost to the employee. Housing must meet a wide range of safety and health standards, including:\n- In rooms where workers cook, live, and sleep, a minimum of 100 square feet per person is required\n- In rooms where workers sleep, each occupant must have at least 50 square feet of floor space.\n- In camps with shared cooking facilities, one stove per 10 occupants shall be provided\n- Housing will have a safe and adequate water supply for cooking, cleaning, and bathing\n- Housing will be adequately heated, lit, kept clean, maintained, etc.\n- H-2A employee housing should be inspected by the State Workforce Agency every 36 months in order for the employer to qualify for the H-2A visa program. In non-inspection years, the employer may “self-certify” that their housing meets all the necessary standards. Each state may conduct H-2A housing inspections slightly differently or on different schedules\n- Meals. Employers must provide three meals per day at the Department of Labor-approved cost, or provide free and convenient facilities for workers to store food and prepare meals (i.e a kitchen).\n- Transportation. Employers must provide daily transportation between housing and the worksite at no cost.\n- Inbound and outbound expenses. Once the worker has completed 50% of the contract, the employer must reimburse them for reasonable costs related to transportation and subsistence necessary to emigrate to the job. Upon completion of the contract, the employer must provide or pay for transportation and subsistence for the employee to return home.\n- Equipment. Any required tools, supplies, and equipment necessary to do the work will be provided to the employee at no charge.\n- Earning records. Employers must keep accurate written records that include the number of work hours offered each day, and the number of hours actually worked by the employee. On or before each payday, the worker will be given a written earnings statement that includes:\n- Hours of work offered;\n- Hours actually worked and/or units actually produced;\n- Hourly rate and/or piece rate;\n- Total earnings; and\n- Any and all deductions from earnings.\n- Written agreements. No later than the time at which the H-2A worker applies for their visa, the worker must be given a written copy of a contract or work agreement, in a language that the employee understands. At the very least, the work agreement must include the information the employer provided to the Department of Labor, which includes:\n- The beginning and end of the contract period;\n- The location(s) of work to be performed;\n- The hours per day and days per week that they will be expected to work;\n- The crop(s) to be worked and/or each job that will be performed\n- The applicable rate(s) for each job;\n- Any and all conditions of employment, including payment for the migrant’s incoming transport expenses, housing and meals that will be provided, and any specific days where work will not be required (holidays);\n- Worker’s compensation insurance will be provided to the employee at no charge; and\n- Any allowable deductions (meals at DOL-approved rates, applicable taxes, etc.).\n- Additional protections. H-2A workers also have a broad range of protections under the law. Employers may not hold passports or immigration documents or seek payment for anything related to the costs of the H-2A visa (including immigration fees, attorney costs, application fees, etc.). Employers may not discriminate or retaliate against employees who have exercised or asserted any of their rights, including by consulting with an attorney, filing a complaint, or testifying in court.\nHow can Farmer Law help with H-2A employee rights?\nThe H-2A visa process can be complicated, and both employees and employers have to comply with a variety of laws, regulations, and standards. An immigration attorney who specializes in agriculture and migrant workers can help guide employees and employers efficiently through the process. For H-2A employees who suspect that their rights are not being respected, consulting a qualified attorney is the first step toward ensuring your rights and protecting your interests.', 'When Verifying Work Eligibility, Avoid Asking for Too Much\nBy Jacob M. Monty, Monty & Ramirez LLP\nWhile it’s important to verify employees’ work eligibility, be sure you don’t violate their rights under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) by asking for too much information. Many employers have reached settlements with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) after violating the Act while attempting to verify work eligibility.\nOverstepping Immigration Law\nThe DOJ recently settled with two employers for violating employees’ rights under the INA. The agency said United General Bakery, Inc., and McDonald’s should not have requested specific and/or additional documents to verify noncitizens’ work eligibility. The actions violated the law because individuals should be treated the same, regardless of their citizenship status.\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) sets specific guidelines and lists valid documents individuals may produce to verify their employment eligibility. According to the settlements, both employers:\n- Requested Department of Homeland Security-issued employment eligibility documents while rejecting other documents that were valid under USCIS’s guidelines; and\n- Failed to request similar documents from U.S. citizens.\nUnited General Bakery also routinely requested additional documents from lawful permanent citizens when their permanent resident cards expired. Under those circumstances, an employer can be penalized if employees or the DOJ can show it didn’t similarly reverify documentation for U.S. citizens. Individuals with permanent resident cards are assumed to have continuous authorization to work, so reverifying their eligibility violates the INA.\nThe DOJ found both employers failed to follow USCIS guidelines for verifying employment and engaged in an unfair documentary practice based on citizenship status in violation of the INA. Specifically, they asked only noncitizens to produce additional or certain kinds of paperwork while U.S. citizens could present standard documentation. Both settlements underscore employers’ ongoing struggle to verify work eligibility while complying with the Act.\nThey’re Sorry—Now What?\nUnited General Bakery was hit with a civil penalty of $45,000, while McDonald’s was ordered to pay more—$82,000—likely because more employees were affected. Both employers were required to post the “If You Have the Right to Work” poster about immigrant and employee rights and create or revise their employment policies to:\n- Prohibit discrimination based on citizenship, immigration status, or national origin;\n- Include equal employment opportunity statements; and\n- Explain how to complain about discrimination in the hiring or firing process.\nThe employers may not retaliate against individuals for filing a charge or participating in an investigation or action under the INA. They also must train HR personnel about their obligations under the Act and are subject to DOJ compliance monitoring.\nIn addition, McDonald’s was ordered to pay lost wages plus interest to the complaining individual or anyone who suffered an economic injury because of its work eligibility verification practices. Its HR personnel must complete a training assessment to be sure they understand the proper Form I-9 procedures.\nHow to Protect your Organization\nIt’s important to verify workers’ employment eligibility, but also be sure you aren’t violating their rights under the INA. It’s a fine line, to be certain, but you can start by reviewing your internal policies and procedures to ensure they’re aligned with the law. Here are some additional tips:\n- Provide applicants with the official I-9 list of acceptable documents, and don’t require them to pony up specific paperwork. (The same is true if you’re reverifying an employee’s work authorization.)\n- Treat everyone the same regardless of their citizenship status.\n- Don’t have discriminatory statements on your job postings that favor U.S. citizens; and\n- Train HR personnel on your internal policies and procedures, and make sure they’re properly implementing them. Doing so can help you to avoid potential costly civil penalties and DOJ investigations in the future.\nJacob M. Monty—the managing partner of Monty & Ramirez, LLP and editor of Texas Employment Law Letter—practices at the intersection of immigration and labor law.']	['<urn:uuid:69da8cda-4322-4e61-8e5f-2a042680b15f>', '<urn:uuid:28bb188d-9e95-42d9-932c-a57370d004e5>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	5	104	1925
12	public transportation environmental impact infrastructure requirements	Public transportation significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions, with rail transit producing 76% lower emissions per passenger mile than cars. The infrastructure requirements are complex - UTA needs specialized equipment like Power over Ethernet technology to power cameras and ticket machines over distances up to 2500 feet, and Ethernet extenders that can operate in extreme temperatures from -22°F to 167°F.	['UTA (Utah Transit Authority) – Energizes its Transportation Grid\nMeeting Evolving Transportation System Needs\nEstablished in 1970, the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) has become a multi-modal transportation leader that is 100-percent accessible with 69 light rail vehicles, 30 commuter rail cars and more than 600 buses. UTA’s TRAX light rail system is currently averaging more than 58,300 riders a day along its 15-mile Salt Lake-Sandy line and the 4-mile University Line.\nProviding the transportation system that gets us to work, takes children to school and shuttles us to entertainment wherever we wish to go may seem trivial, but can be a complex business. In the state of Utah, temperatures drop well below freezing in mountain winters and get extremely hot in the desert summers. Magnetic sensors in the street and traffic monitoring cameras can be mounted hundreds of feet from the traffic control system and often have no existing power cabling except at the control system box.\nPowering Remote Traffic Surveillance Cameras with Power Over Ethernet (PoE)\nProviding power to devices (cameras, ticket machines and street sensors) can get expensive. Previously, every device would require its own electrical connection, power adapter and cable. When considering cable runs of over 2000 feet, this can get expensive as well. The solution is to provide electricity via Power over Ethernet (PoE) technology that allows both power and data to be transmitted over the same Category 5 (a.k.a. Cat 5) cable that is used for data. However, the PoE standard is often too short for most traffic-related requirements.\nThe Utah Transit Authority needed to run both PoE power and Ethernet data over long distances. They leveraged Enable-IT’s solid state Ethernet extender technology to achieve their goals. The UTA can now power older remote ticketing systems, modern PoE cameras and street sensors 24x7x365 on its light rail and bus transportation station congestion control networks up to 2500 feet away.\nOperating in the Extreme Winter Cold and Summer Heat\nOutdoor temperatures in Utah greatly fluctuate throughout the year. The cameras, magnetic sensors, control systems and wires heat and cool throughout the day. Such dynamic conditions require solid state electronic components. The UTA tested several components and selected the Enable-IT 860 and 865 Ethernet extenders, which can support temperature ranges as extreme as from -30°C (-22°F) to +75°C (167°F) over long distances.\nGoing the Distance – Over Existing Infrastructure\nThe story doesn’t end at the traffic stop. Traffic networks are a connection of traffic stops throughout the city, county and state. Some stops are significant distances from each other. To leverage the power of a traffic network, these stops must all be connected. Ethernet only runs 328 feet, so connecting stops that are a mile apart, can become a major issue. Also, traffic networks are traditionally tied together with regular phone wire, not Category 5 Ethernet cable. Replacing countless miles of cable gets extremely expensive.\nFortunately the UTA tested Enable-IT’s 860 long distance Ethernet extender, capable of powering Ethernet up to 6000 feet over existing telephone cable as well as Category 5 Ethernet cable. This proved to be the solution needed to help tie everything together on the UTA’s existing infrastructure.', 'Environmentalists have long touted the benefits of carpooling and utilizing mass transit in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow the effects of climate change. By utilizing high-occupancy vehicles (HOVs), more people can be transported to the same place in one vehicle, versus each person driving themselves separately.\nThis not only reduces traffic and congestion, but is beneficial to our already stressed environment. Additionally, individuals can save hundreds or even thousands of dollars each year by using public transportation instead of driving a personal vehicle.\nStatistics indicate that in 2014 Americans took 10.8 billion trips on public transportation, and ridership has increased nearly 40 percent since 1995. This has effectively saved the United States about 450 million gallons of fuel, significantly reduced traffic congestion, and cut about 865 million hours of travel time for passengers. This is a true testament to just how popular mass transit has become, as well as indicative of its numerous benefits.\nBenefits of Public Transportation\nOne of the benefits of public transportation is its positive impact on air quality. In heavily congested urban areas, air quality is often subpar and poses serious health threats to residents.\nIt is estimated that transportation accounts for nearly 30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the US. Using public transportation can significantly reduce these emissions.\nAs public transit improves, we are seeing eco-friendlier vehicles introduced into public transit fleets. Older, gas-powered buses are increasingly being replaced by more fuel-efficient compressed natural gas (CNG) buses. Additionally, diesel buses are being phased out in favor of hybrid-diesel or bio-diesel models.\nWhile buses are considerably better for the environment than personal vehicles, rail transit is even better. Trains used for public transportation are often powered by electricity, and therefore emit very little, if any, pollution. Rail transit is particularly environmentally friendly, as these vehicles boast 76 percent lower greenhouse gas emissions per passenger mile then an average car.\nDrawbacks of Public Transit\nAlthough there are quite a few benefits to using public transportation, there also some drawbacks worth mentioning. Some environmental and auto industry experts believe that if the current public transit system is not overhauled it will continue to have a negative impact on the environment.\nDue to the increasing ridership over the past 30 years, energy use has skyrocketed. Experts believe that if vehicle use doubles by the year 2050 as projected, very little of the earth’s natural resources will be available to sustain the system.\nExperts propose that innovative technology be utilized to streamline the system and make it more energy-efficient. Another issue is poorly-planned routes that result in decreased ridership. It is not only costly but also environmentally damaging for these buses and trains to operate with few passengers.\nAnother issue with public transportation is accessibility. For those who do not live in major metropolitan epicenters, public transportation is either limited or nonexistent. For these people, using a car to get around is an absolute must because of the lack of accessibility.\nAdditionally, the increase in what ridership that has taken place in recent years is due in part to wildly fluctuating gas prices. This means that these increases are heavily dependent on gas prices and may not be sustainable in the long run.\nHow to Make Public Transit Better\nIn order to make public transportation even better for the environment and the citizens it serves, there is much work still to be done. Recently, Navigant Research released a study indicating what it believes the future of public transit will look like.\nThe study concluded that autonomous vehicles will be more prevalent, and an on-demand system will most likely be the way that we summon mass transit vehicles. This will not only increase the convenience of public transportation, but it will also foster technology that will see more electric and wireless-capable vehicles. These low to no emissions vehicles will undoubtedly be better for the environment than our current natural gas powered system.\nGovernments are also taking notice of how emissions adversely affect the environment and are actively working to create more clean energy laws that make it easier for citizens to access electric vehicles. Many government vehicles are already in the process of being replaced with more energy-efficient vehicles.\nMass transit vehicles are slowly moving towards this trend as well. Even ridesharing companies such as Uber and Lyft are also looking into incorporating more electric vehicles into their fleets.\nPublic transit systems are always looking for ways to increase ridership by offering various incentives as well as educating the public on the benefits of using mass transit. Experts in the field also suggest limiting or eliminating transit services in areas where demand is not sufficient to justify their use.']	['<urn:uuid:59b6bd24-09f0-415c-9f8c-23ab24f0bdd2>', '<urn:uuid:1b9443a0-cfd4-4c2c-bb8b-970bf58d4949>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	6	59	1307
13	How many different types of histones are involved in binding to DNA in the nucleus, and what makes these proteins so special in terms of their evolution?	There are 5 kinds of histones that bind to DNA in the nucleus. These histones are some of the most conserved molecules during evolution, meaning they've changed very little over time. For example, histone H4 in calf differs from H4 in pea plant at only 2 amino acid residues out of 102.	"['|Index to this page|\nThe nucleus is enveloped by a pair of membranes enclosing a lumen that is continuous with that of the endoplasmic reticulum. The inner membrane is stabilized by a meshwork of intermediate filament proteins called lamins.\nThe nuclear envelope is perforated by thousands of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) that control the passage of molecules in and out of the nucleus.\nThe nucleus contains the chromosomes of the cell. Each chromosome consists of a single molecule of DNA complexed with an equal mass of proteins. Collectively, the DNA of the nucleus with its associated proteins is called chromatin.\nMost of the protein consists of multiple copies of 5 kinds of histones. These are basic proteins, bristling with positively charged arginine and lysine residues. (Both Arg and Lys have a free amino group on their R group, which attracts protons (H+) giving them a positive charge.) Just the choice of amino acids you would make to bind tightly to the negatively-charged phosphate groups of DNA.\nChromatin also contains small amounts of a wide variety of nonhistone proteins. Most of these are transcription factors (e.g., the steroid receptors) and their association with the DNA is more transient.\nThe image running down on the left shows the 5 histones separated by electrophoresis. These 5 proteins vary little from one cell type to another or even from one species to another. However, the many nonhistone proteins in chromatin (shown on the right) do vary from one cell type to another and from one species to another. (Courtesy of Gary S. Stein and Janet Swinehart Stein, University of Florida.)\nFrom 20–60 bp of DNA link one nucleosome to the next. Each linker region is occupied by a single molecule of histone 1 (H1). This region is longer (50–150 bp) adjacent to the promoters of genes which presumably makes more room for the binding of transcription factors.\nThe binding of histones to DNA does not depend on particular nucleotide sequences in the DNA but does depend critically on the amino acid sequence of the histone. Histones are some of the most conserved molecules during the course of evolution. Histone H4 in the calf differs from H4 in the pea plant at only 2 amino acids residues in the chain of 102.\nThis electron micrograph (courtesy of David E. Olins and Ada L. Olins) shows chromatin from the nucleus of a chicken red blood cell (birds, unlike most mammals, retain the nucleus in their mature red blood cells). The arrows point to the nucleosomes. You can see why the arrangement of nucleosomes has been likened to ""beads on a string"".\nThe formation of nucleosomes helps somewhat, but not nearly enough, to make the DNA sufficiently compact to fit in the nucleus. In order to fit 46 DNA molecules (in humans), totaling over 2 meters in length, into a nucleus that may be only 10 µm across requires more extensive folding and compaction.\nAlthough their amino acid sequence (primary structure) is unvarying, individual histone molecules do vary in structure as a result of chemical modifications that occur later to individual amino acids.These include adding:\nMost of the chemical modifications occur on these tails, especially of H3 and H4. Most of theses changes are reversible. For example, acetyl groups are\nBut there is surely more to the story.\nIn general, the ""standard"" histones are incorporated into the nucleosomes as new DNA is synthesized during S phase of the cell cycle. Later, some are replaced by variant histones as conditions in the cell dictate.\nPortions of one chromosome can loop out of its territory and interact with part of a different chromosome looping out from its territory. These are ""kissing"" chromosomes.\nThe examples that have been found so far indicate that these interactions are another way of coordinating the activity of genes residing on different chromosomes. [More]\nThe human genome contains many genes — scattered along different chromosomes — that are turned on by the arrival of a single signal. Among the many genes activated by estrogen, are TIFF1 on chromosome 21 and GREB1 on chromosome 2. Using FISH analysis, researchers at the University of California in San Diego showed that within a little as 2 minutes after exposing cells to estrogen, the TIFF1 and GREB1 loci move from their respective chromosome territories and ""kiss"".\nAnother example:In the mouse, naive helper T cells — awaiting a signal to direct them to become either Th1 cells or Th2 cells — have\nWhen the cell receives the signals committing it to one path or the other, the two regions separate, the appropriate one going to a region of active transcription; the other to a region of heterochromatin.\nAnd still another example (in this case, two loci far apart on the same chromosome ""kiss""):\nIn the head region of the Drosophila larva, expression of the homeobox (HOX) genes Antp and Abd-B is shut down [Link]. FISH analysis shows that these two loci — 10,000,000 base pairs apart on chromosome III — are brought together in the nucleus bound by proteins that prevent their transcription.\nThe density of the chromatin that makes up each chromosome (that is, how tightly it is packed) varies along the length of the chromosome.\n|More on insulators|\nTranscription factors cannot bind to their promoter if the promoter is blocked by a nucleosome. One of the first functions of the assembling transcription factors is to either expel the nucleosome from the site where transcription begins or at least to slide the nucleosomes along the DNA molecule. Either action exposes the gene\'s promoter so that the transcription factors can then bind to it.\nThe actual transcription of protein-coding genes is done by RNA polymerase II (Pol II or RNAP II). In order for it to travel along the DNA to be transcribed, a complex of proteins removes the nucleosomes in front of it and then replaces them after Pol II has transcribed that portion of DNA and moved on.\nAs is the case in transcription, the DNA helix must open to allow DNA replication to proceed. This, too, requires that the nucleosomes preceding the replication fork be removed and then quickly reassembled as the leading and lagging strands are synthesized. [View]\nDuring the period between cell divisions, when the chromosomes are in their extended state, one or more of them (10 in human cells) have loops extending into a spherical mass called the nucleolus. Here are synthesized three (of the four) kinds of RNA molecules (28S, 18S, 5.8S) used in the assembly of the large and small subunits of ribosomes.\n28S, 18S, and 5.8S ribosomal RNA is transcribed (by RNA polymerase I) from hundreds to thousands of tandemly-arranged rDNA genes distributed (in humans) on 10 different chromosomes. The rDNA-containing regions of these 10 chromosomes cluster together in the nucleolus.(In yeast, the 5S rRNA molecules — as well as transfer RNA molecules — are also synthesized (by RNA polymerase III) in the nucleolus.)\nOnce formed, rRNA molecules associate with the dozens of different ribosomal proteins used in the assembly of the large and small subunits of the ribosome.But proteins are synthesized in the cytosol — and all the ribosomes are needed in the cytosol to do their work — so there must be a mechanism for the transport of these large structures in and out of the nucleus. This is one of the functions of the nuclear pore complexes.\nThe nuclear envelope is perforated with thousands of pores.Each is constructed from multiple copies of several dozen different proteins called nucleoporins.\nThe entire assembly forms an aqueous channel connecting the cytosol with the interior of the nucleus (""nucleoplasm""). When materials are to be transported through the pore, it opens up to form a channel some 27–41 nm wide — large enough to get such large assemblies as ribosomal subunits through.\nTransport through the nuclear pore complexes is active; that is, it requires\nProteins are synthesized in the cytosol and those needed by the nucleus must be imported into it through the NPCs.They include:\nProbably all of these proteins has a characteristic sequence of amino acids — called a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) — that target them for entry.\nBoth the RNA and protein molecules contain a characteristic nuclear export sequence (NES) needed to ensure their association with the right carrier molecules to take them out to the cytosol.']"	['<urn:uuid:4884fab0-7f68-4877-ba4d-1e3e9308ae00>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	27	52	1387
14	What kind of problems do people face when trying to grow food in urban areas like Portland, and how can they deal with those issues?	In urban areas, the main challenges are limited space, lack of sunlight due to trees and buildings, and soil contamination with lead. People can deal with these issues by using raised garden beds built on concrete slabs, using vertical planting methods like fabric growing pockets on deck railings, and heavily mulching garden beds. They can also join community gardens and use permaculture design principles to maximize food production in small spaces.	['Small Scale Homesteading Tastes Just Right\nBy Anna Hewitt\nHomesteading has historically been considered an act of self reliance typical of rural areas with abundant land, but small scale homesteaders in Maine and across the country are finding that they can grow, raise, and produce food wherever they live. Spurred by a desire to be more connected to their food and concerns about the impacts of climate change and industrial agriculture, many people are choosing to reconnect to the basic skills and traditions that were part of everyday life for generations. People in urban and suburban areas of southern Maine are re-discovering what our rural neighbors have known all along: the delicious taste of eggs from chickens they know, the satisfaction of harvesting vegetables right outside their back door, and that there is so much more you can do with a lawn than just mow it.\nSMALL PLOT EQUALS BIG OPPORTUNITY\nA Scarborough development made up of two acre lots and large houses is an unlikely place to find chickens and pigs. After moving there from a smaller lot in Portland, Mark and Teri Ouellette realized that they had enough space to really teach their three children about where their food comes from. Two ten-by-ten garden plots supply the family with flowers for cutting and an abundance of salad which they eat all summer long. It was Teri’s idea to add animals to their back yard farm. If Mark was reluctant at first, now he is an enthusiastic proponent of raising animals in the suburbs, not only for “the best-tasting eggs I’ve ever had” but for the opportunity to help their children “understand the cycle of life, where food comes from, and why it tastes the way it tastes.”\nIn addition to their flock of nine chickens which supply the family with plenty of eggs, the Ouellettes raised two pigs last year. Mark describes the experience as “absolutely unbelievable” and something he would certainly do again. The family fed and cared for the pigs but always kept in mind that aptly-named “Hammy” and “Crispy Bacon” were not pets. He admits that the first time their homegrown pork was on their plates it felt strange. But he believes that the hesitation was healthy and provoked a good conversation about their food and the animals’ life cycle. They are considering a goat, donkey, or rabbits in the future.\nThe development where the Ouellettes live is built on what was once farmland, and zoning laws were never changed. This allows the family to care for animals, feed themselves well, and bring a little bit of the farmland feel back to the area. Their neighbors were initially skeptical and some were even opposed to the idea but over time Mark says “people ended up loving it.”\nMany towns in Maine currently allow residents to raise chickens in residential areas. Laws generally allow up to six hens (but some towns allow more) and may require permits or other specifications. Some examples of cities and towns with chicken ordinances include Portland, South Portland, Falmouth, Westbrook, Scarborough, Saco, Biddeford, Cumberland, Brunswick, York, Camden, Auburn, Orono, and Dover-Foxcroft. However, since the specific requirements of ordinances vary and are subject to change, it’s best to check with your town hall before building a chicken coop.\nTHE CHALLENGES OF URBAN SPACES\nAlthough Leslie Pohl grew up in urban and suburban environments, her grandparents were farmers in Iowa and she’s always considered farming part of her heritage. After years in New York City, she and her husband moved to Maine to be closer to family. She began connecting to her agricultural roots by choosing produce from local farms, and joining her neighborhood community garden. She says she remembers vividly the first time she picked corn right from the field with her young daughter.\nHer husband Bob’s concerns about energy efficiency introduced them to permaculture, a growing movement in Maine and around the world that utilizes sustainability as the basis for designing landscape and building systems. One of the central ideas of permaculture is to design landscapes in a way that they produce more energy than they consume.\nAs Leslie began to learn more about this approach, she was inspired to find ways to grow food in the small spaces around her apartment building in Portland’s West End. She hired a designer who specialized in the permaculture approach and hosted a work party to implement the design.\nThe small deck attached to the back of the apartment that Leslie shares with her husband and daughter is just a few steps from their kitchen. During the work party, they crafted a raised bed from pallets perched on one edge of the deck, and attached fabric growing pockets to the deck railings to allow for vertical planting in the minimal space. These improvements mean that, Leslie can grow a variety of vegetables to harvest right outside her door.\nSpace was not the only challenge that she had to work with. As in many urban areas, trees and buildings block sunlight from reaching the deck for parts of the day. So Leslie also has a community garden plot in the nearby Clark Street community garden. As part of the permaculture design, she rebuilt the plot from the typical rows of plants with lots of bare soil between them, into two heavily mulched curved beds, ideal for inhibiting weeds and capturing water when it rains.\nIn addition to the challenge of finding time, space, and light to grow, Leslie has had to deal with another reality of growing food in a city environment. Most city soil is contaminated with lead which can make plants that are growing in it unsafe to eat. Fortunately, there are ways to work around this. Three raised garden beds were constructed in the small space between Leslie’s building and her neighbors. First, they placed slabs of concrete over the contaminated soil and layered mulch made up of seaweed, compost, newspaper, and straw to cover the slabs and create a healthy environment for planting away from the polluted soil. One of the three raised beds contains a small pond to create a welcoming environment for birds and insects that will help pollinate the plants. They also built a roof structure to funnel rainwater into storage barrels used for watering the plants. This year will be Leslie’s first season growing in the new beds and she is excited to see what happens.\nLeslie is down to earth and honest about her approach to urban homesteading. Both she and Bob have taken small steps and stuck to it. She is passionate about growing food this way as well as maintaining a sustainable home and believes, “permaculture is the answer to what ails us.” As both she and Bob work full time and care for their 11-year old daughter, time isn’t always abundant. And neither is space. What they have plenty of is knowledge, and the desire to live a healthy, sustainable and harmonious life in their urban environment. “We just want to do as much as we can with what we have and learn along the way.” She hopes that their experiences, challenges, and limitations will help to build a knowledge base for others who want to try similar things.\nGROCERIES FROM THE GARDEN\nWhen Jesse McAvoy and Ben Roehrl bought a house in Westbrook they knew they wanted to transition the large lawn into garden space. They began by building a few raised beds for a vegetable garden, and five years later, they have devoted a significant portion of their half-acre property to food production. They raise chickens and ducks, and eat year-round from food they have grown themselves or purchased locally. Eating locally and growing their own food has become a way of life, and Jesse believes, a way “to produce food that nurtures us as well as our environment.”\nLike Leslie, Ben and Jesse tapped into the area’s vibrant permaculture community to guide their homesteading efforts. They began by hosting a permaculture design workshop at their house to develop a clear plan for the space. They also enlisted community members to to help implement their ideas. And with the help of a work party, they built an herb spiral and large round garden beds to efficiently increase their food production. They dug an earthen basin pond to collect rainwater and attract beneficial birds and insects, and also planted berries and fruit trees which double as living fences to divide the front of the yard—closer to the street—from the back yard where the gardens and animals are located. Future plans for enhancing their home include adding solar panels, a wood stove, and constructing a more extensive root cellar which will regulate temperature and humidity for long-term food storage.\nWhen Jesse and Ben talk about the ways they have embraced and implemented homesteading on their property, it is clear that they put a great deal of thought and planning into it. With each new endeavor, they take time to observe others who are already doing it, research every imaginable step, and figure out how it will work for them. The connections they have made through homesteading are a driving force behind what they do. They begin new projects with confidence knowing that they have a network of people to help them when things don’t go as planned, and as they learn and master skills, such as raising and processing ducks for meat, they share their knowledge with others.\nWith all of the fruits and vegetables they are producing, Ben and Jesse spend a lot of time preserving food by canning and fermenting. Depending on the season they also fill their freezer with produce, homemade bread, meat from their ducks, and pork and lamb they purchase from Maine farms. They use their cool basement for long term storage of root vegetables and squash as well as unwashed chicken eggs. It may seem like a lot of work to grow, prepare, and preserve food this way but they see it as an even trade for grocery shopping. “Instead of going to the store,” Ben explains, “You go into the basement. It becomes a labor of love and once you establish a system it really doesn’t take a lot of time to maintain.” He plans ahead to fit the work in around his job while Jesse works part time and devotes his other hours to work on their homestead. They are trying to grow more perennial plants, like the perennial arugula, sorrel, and shiso greens that they use in salads, which will reduce the need for yearly planting. After increasing the garden space, they no longer spend time mowing “a bunch of useless grass.”\nJesse and Ben have put in a lot of time and effort learning what it takes to create their food, which makes eating and living this way enjoyable to them. And while their commitment to eating locally runs deep, they also believe in finding a balance, especially when it pertains to coffee, chocolate and the occasional avocado. “There is no wrong answer.” They say, “Everyone should follow their passions and do what works best for them.”\nAnna Hewitt is a writer, artist, and mother living in southern Maine.

15	virtual avatar impact real life actions social media platform design control user behavior	Virtual avatars can significantly influence real-world behavior even when users don't consciously identify with them, as demonstrated by research where participants' actions were affected by briefly playing as heroic or villainous characters. Similarly, social media platforms' design features control user behavior through infinite scrolling and algorithmic content, though this can be mitigated through design interventions like customized lists and reading history labels, which help users maintain more conscious control over their online experiences.	"['The alter-egos that players adopt in online games can affect how individuals act in real life, according to new research published in the latest issue of the journal Psychological Science.\n""Our results indicate that just five minutes of role-play in virtual environments as either a hero or villain can easily cause people to reward or punish anonymous strangers,"" says lead researcher Gunwoo Yoon of the University of Illinois.\nAccording Yoon and his co-author Patrick Vargas, virtual environments provide them with “a vehicle for observation, imitation, and modelling” as well as offering individuals the chance to act and feel in a way they cannot in real life.\nThe pair recruited 194 undergraduates for a pair of ostensibly unrelated studies, first placing each student in a virtual game world and asking them to fight enemies. Each individual was assigned an avatar representing an ethical stance; Superman for heroism, Voldemort for villainy, and a circle as neutral.\nThen, a second study asked the same students to participate in a blind taste test of either chocolate or some fiery chili sauce, and told that the next participant would have to eat whatever they had been assigned.\nThe results showed that undergraduates who had played as Superman gave nearly twice as much chocolate as chili sauce to the “future participant” while those who had spent time in Voldemort’s virtual shoes gave out twice as much chili sauce as they did chocolate.\nA second round of tests with a fresh batch of 125 undergraduates confirmed these findings while also showing that playing as a certain avatar didn’t have nearly as great an affect as watching some else take on a role.\nYoon and Vargas noted that individuals’ behaviour was affected even if consciously they reported not identifying with their avatar: “These behaviours occur despite modest, equivalent levels of self-reported identification with heroic and villainous avatars, alike,” said the pair. “People are prone to be unaware of the influence of their virtual representations on their behavioural responses.”\nIn the paper, titled ‘Virtual avatars may impact real-world behaviour,’ the researchers suggested that the degree to which individuals were affected was influenced by how involved they were in the gameplay.\nThis is not the first time that psychologists have studied the transference of behaviour from video games to real life. A study carried out earlier this year by Nottingham Trent university found that regular players reported seeing elements from video games such as menus, displays or music appearing in their vision.\nYoon speculates that his research could have implications for social behaviour: ""In virtual environments, people can freely choose avatars that allow them to opt into or opt out of a certain entity, group, or situation,"" he said. ""Consumers and practitioners should remember that powerful imitative effects can occur when people put on virtual masks.""\nThe effects of this sort of roleplay and imitation have long been commented upon by writers and thinkers - as well as psychologists. As George Orwell wrote in ‘Shooting an Elephant’, his essay on the pressures and expectations facing colonial troops in India: “He wears a mask and his face grows to fit it.”Reuse content', 'Disrupted sleep, decrease life satisfaction and poor vanity are just some of the adverse psychological well being penalties that researchers have linked to social media. In some way the identical platforms that may assist folks really feel extra linked and educated additionally contribute to loneliness and disinformation. What succeeds and fails, scientists say, is a perform of how these platforms are designed. Amanda Baughan, a graduate pupil specializing in human-computer interplay on the College of Washington, research how social media triggers what psychologists name dissociation, or a state of diminished self-reflection and narrowed consideration. She offered outcomes on the 2022 Affiliation for Computing Equipment Laptop-Human Interplay Convention on Human Elements in Computing Techniques. Baughan spoke with Thoughts Issues editor Daisy Yuhas to elucidate how and why apps want to alter to present the individuals who use them better energy.\n[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]\nYou’ve proven how altering social media cues and shows may enhance well-being, even when folks strongly disagree on points. Are you able to give an instance?\nThe design of social media can have quite a lot of energy in how folks work together with each other and the way they really feel about their on-line experiences. For instance, we’ve discovered that social media design can truly assist folks really feel extra supportive and type in moments of on-line battle, offered there’s a bit little bit of a nudge to behave that method. In a single examine, we designed an intervention that inspired individuals who begin speaking about one thing contentious in a remark thread to change to direct messaging. Folks actually preferred it. It helped to resolve their battle and replicated an answer we use in-person: folks having a public argument transfer to a personal area to work issues out.\nYou’ve additionally tackled a unique downside popping out of social media utilization known as the 30-Minute Ick Issue. What’s that?\nWe in a short time lose ourselves on social media. When folks encounter a platform the place they will infinitely scroll for extra data, it may set off an identical neurocognitive reward system as in anticipating a profitable lottery ticket or getting meals. It’s a robust method that these apps are designed to maintain us checking and scrolling.\nThe 30-Minute Ick Issue is when folks imply to examine their social media briefly however then discover that half-hour have handed, and once they notice how a lot time they’ve spent, they’ve this sense of disgust and disappointment in themselves. Analysis has proven that individuals are dissatisfied with this ordinary social media use. Lots of people body it as meaningless, unproductive or addictive.\nYou’ve argued this expertise is much less a matter of dependancy and extra a problem of dissociation. Why?\nDissociation is a psychological course of that is available in many varieties. In the most typical, on a regular basis dissociation, your thoughts is so absorbed that you’re disconnected out of your actions. You could possibly be doing the dishes, begin daydreaming and never take note of how you might be doing the dishes. Otherwise you would possibly search immersive experiences—watching a film, studying a e-book or taking part in a recreation—that move the time and trigger you to overlook the place you might be.\nThroughout these actions, your sense of reflective self-consciousness and the passage of time is diminished. Folks solely notice that they dissociated in hindsight. Consideration is restored with the sense of “What simply occurred?” or “My leg fell asleep whereas we had been watching that film!”\nDissociation generally is a constructive factor, particularly if it’s an absorbing expertise, significant exercise or a wanted break. But it surely can be dangerous in sure instances, as in playing, or are available in battle with folks’s time-management targets, as with social media scrolling.\nHow do you measure folks’s dissociation on social media?\nWe labored with 43 contributors who used a customized cell app that we created known as Chirp to entry their Twitter accounts. The app let folks work together with Twitter content material whereas permitting us to ask them questions and take a look at interventions. So when folks had been utilizing Chirp, after a given variety of minutes, we’d ship them a questionnaire primarily based on a psychological scale for measuring dissociation. We requested how a lot they agreed with the assertion “I’m presently utilizing Chirp with out actually listening to what I’m doing” on a scale of 1 to five. We additionally did interviews with 11 folks to be taught extra. The outcomes confirmed dissociation occurred in 42 p.c of our contributors, they usually usually reported shedding observe of time or feeling “all-consumed.”\nYou designed 4 interventions that changed folks’s Twitter expertise on Chirp to scale back dissociation. What labored?\nProbably the most profitable had been customized lists and studying historical past labels. In customized lists, we pressured customers to categorize the content material they adopted, comparable to “sports activities” or “information” or “buddies.” Then, as an alternative of interacting with Twitter’s major feed, they engaged solely with content material on these lists. This method was coupled with a studying historical past intervention through which folks acquired a message once they had been caught up on the most recent tweets. Moderately than persevering with to scroll, they had been alerted to what that they had already seen, and they also targeted on simply the most recent content material. These interventions diminished dissociation, and once we did interviews, folks stated they felt safer checking their social media accounts when these modifications had been current.\nIn one other design, folks acquired timed messages letting them know the way lengthy that they had been on Chirp and suggesting they go away. In addition they had the choice of viewing a utilization web page that confirmed them statistics comparable to how a lot time they’d spent on Chirp prior to now seven days. These two options had been efficient if folks opted to make use of them. Many individuals ignored them, nevertheless. Additionally, they thought the timed messages had been annoying. These findings are fascinating as a result of quite a lot of the favored time-management instruments obtainable to folks appear like these time-out and utilization notifications.\nSo what may social media firms be doing in a different way? And is there any incentive for them to alter?\nProper now there’s a lot working towards individuals who use social media. It’s unimaginable to ever totally compensate for a social media feed, particularly when you think about the algorithmically inserted content material comparable to Twitter’s trending tweets or TikTok’s “For You” web page. However I feel that there’s hope that comparatively easy tweaks to social media design, comparable to customized lists, could make a distinction. It’s essential to notice that the customized lists considerably diminished dissociation for folks—however they did not considerably have an effect on time spent utilizing the app. To me, that factors out that lowering folks’s dissociation will not be as antithetical to social media firms’ income targets as we’d intuitively suppose.\nWhat’s most essential for folks utilizing social media now to know?\nFirst, don’t pile a bunch of disgrace onto your social media habits. Hundreds of individuals are employed to make you swipe your thumb up on that display screen and maintain you doing what you’re doing. Let’s shift the duty of designing protected and fulfilling experiences from customers to the businesses.\nSecond, get conversant in the well-being instruments which are already supplied. TikTok has a function that, each hour, will inform you that you simply’ve been scrolling for some time and may contemplate a break. On Twitter, customized lists are a function that already exists; it’s simply not the default choice. If extra folks begin utilizing these instruments, it may persuade these firms to refine them.\nMost essential, vote for people who find themselves occupied with regulating expertise as a result of I feel that’s the place we’re going to see the largest adjustments made.']"	['<urn:uuid:6a2361bb-c20e-48ba-a80e-c7fc4e2e9ca1>', '<urn:uuid:28ea44cd-4054-4290-8fcb-a13be7579900>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	13	73	1845
16	how was piri reis map discovered	The Piri Reis Map was discovered in 1929 in the Topkapi Palace Library in Istanbul by Gustav Deissmann. However, the general public was not made aware of the map until 1932, except for a Conference held in 1931.	['Piri Reis Map\nThe Piri Reis Map (1513)(c) was a world map drawn on a gazelle skin of which only the left-hand side still exists. It was a composite of detail gleaned from a large collection of maps, including one allegedly captured from Christopher Columbus(i), that were collected by Piri Ibn Haji Mehmed (1465/70–1553), an admiral or ‘reis’ in the Ottoman navy and noted by Rand Flem-Ath as a former pirate. Flem-Ath wrote a lengthy article for Atlantis Rising magazine #38, which I have used here(k) and which contains a lot of interesting background information.\nIt was discovered in 1929 in the Topkapi Palace Library in Istanbul by Gustav Deissmann (sometimes attributed to Library director Halil Edhem).\nFerdinand Speidel has written an interesting article for Atlantisforschung on the background of Piri Reis as well as a translation of the handwritten notes on the map itself(l).\nApart from a Conference in 1931, the general public was not made aware of the map until the following year.\nPiri Reis wrote on the map “It is the only chart of its kind existing now. I, personally, drew and prepared it. In preparing the map I used about twenty old charts and eight ‘Mappa Monde’ (i.e., the charts called ‘Jaferiye’ by the Arabs, and prepared at the time of Alexander the Great, in which the whole inhabited world is shown); the charts of the West Indies; and the new maps made by four Portuguese, showing the Sind, Indian, and Chinese Seas geometrically represented. I also studied the chart that Christopher Columbus drew for the West. By reducing all these charts to a single scale, I compiled the present map.”\nIn 1956 a Turkish naval officer presented the map to the U.S. Navy Hydrographic Office. From there, it was first fully investigated by Captain Arlington H. Mallery, who had spent years studying ancient maps. He is now better remembered as a controversial amateur archaeologist. Mallery concluded that the map accurately depicted an ice-free Antarctica.\nThis map has become one of the controversial elements in the theory of an Antarctic Atlantis so strongly promoted by Rose and Rand Flem-Ath. They followed the views of Charles Hapgood, who, having studied a range of ancient maps, were convinced that they showed parts of Antarctica as ice-free. However, the principal argument against this idea is that the removal of the massive Antarctic ice cap would have had two effects:\n(i) The consequent isostatic rebound would have altered the coastline dramatically and unpredictably.\n(ii) The melting of the icecap would have raised sea levels, producing further changes to the coastline of the exposed continent.\nHowever, Jason Colavito has pointed out(h) that “as scholars have known for decades, the segment of the map identified by Hapgood as “Antarctica” was in fact the southern part of South America, bent to fit the shape of the skin on which it was drawn.”!\nNevertheless, the late Robert Argod supported the antiquity of the original maps upon which the Piri Reis Maps and other medieval charts were based and he also supported the idea of an inhabited ice-free Antarctica.\nA view contrary to the Flem-Aths can be found in a recent book by Gregory McIntosh. Professor Steve Dutch of the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay offers a paper(b) debunking the value of the Piri Reis map, which should be read to get a more balanced view of the controversy. Paul V.Heinrich has also added a highly critical paper with many references(a).>Paul Lunde was equally critical in the Jan-Feb 1980 edition of Aramco World Magazine(n).<\nProfessor Steven Earle uses an assignment entitled ‘Project Atlantis‘(g) for his geology students in order to hone their critical thinking, which focuses on the Flem-Ath’s preferred variant of Pole Shift Theory known as Crustal Displacement.\n>Diego Cuoghi has produced a four-part paper on the Piri Reis Map that is highly critical of those authors who have apparently rushed to adopt Hapgood’s interpretation of the chart without proper investigation with the following comments –\n“But what mystery lovers are most enthusiastic about is the bottom edge of the map, which is said to represent Antarctica. Some claim that Queen Maud Land and other features of Antarctica are clearly recognizable on the map, even though that continent was not explored but many centuries later. Unfortunately, these people, including Hancock, claim the above hypothesis without making any cartographic comparison or first-hand check: they just accept Charles Hapgood’s statements as true. Hancock in particular does not mention any book about the history of cartography within the notes of the first two chapters of his book “Fingerprints of the Gods” (the very chapters about geographic charts). He just quotes Hapgood’s work, thus clearly showing that he didn’t even make an attempt to learn on the subject.”\nCuoghi also tackles the Oronteus Finaeus Map (Part 2), the Philippe Bauche Map (Part 3) and Atlantis (Part 4)(m).<\nWhat the Piri Reis Map has done for Antarctica, the Nicolo Zeno Map of 1380 has done for Greenland which appears to show a deglaciated landmass. Features, hidden by ice but confirmed by modern seismic soundings, are shown. However, controversy has dogged the Nicolo Zeno Map as much as the Piri Reis chart.\nPhillipe Buache the renowned French geographer also published a map of ice-free Antarctica in 1737, long before its recorded discovery and centuries before seismic surveys revealed the topography of the sub-glacial landmass. The source of the data for this map is so far unexplained.\nIn 2004, Jean-Pierre Lacroix & Robert Bywater presented a paper(d) to the International Piri Reis Symposium in which they made the radical claim that the western part of the Piri Reis map was a depiction of the outline of east and southeast Asia, rather than the Caribbean.\nThe ancient-origins website(e) has several papers relating to the Piri Reis Map.\nThe most recent studies(f) include a map showing the effects of just a partial retreat of the ice sheet, showing exposed coastlines, during the Pliocene era, which again indicates an outline of the landmass at variance with the Piri Reis Map.\nA 2021 study(j) of the Map urges caution when interpreting its details.\n(a) Piri Reis Map (archive.org) *\n(g) Wayback Machine (archive.org) *\n(i) Saudi Aramco World : Piri Reis and the Columbus Map (archive.org)\n(j) Pîrî Reis Map of 1513 · Dubious History\n(k) Atlantis Rising magazine #38 http://pdfarchive.info/index.php?pages/At\n(l) What the Piri Reis card reports – Atlantisforschung.de (atlantisforschung-de.translate.goog)\n(m) https://www.diegocuoghi.com/Piri_Reis/PiriReis_eng.htm *\n(n) https://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/198001/piri.reis.and.the.hapgood.hypotheses.htm *']	['<urn:uuid:78e8585b-6176-40d0-8715-3ffd80f74672>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	6	38	1071
17	cost regulations demolition interior walls please	The cost of wall demolition varies depending on the type of wall, with non-load-bearing walls costing between $300 and $1,000, while load-bearing walls in single-story houses cost $1,200-$3,000 and $3,200-$10,000 in multi-story houses. Regarding regulations, any wall removal that changes room size/shape, affects wiring/plumbing, or alters house structure requires a building permit. Failure to comply with Building Regulations can result in fines up to £5000, plus £50 per day of continued violation after conviction. Additionally, local authorities can serve enforcement notices requiring alterations or removal of non-compliant work.	"[""Wondering why you might ever need to knock down a wall? Well, does adding an extension to your house or creating a pass-through between your galley kitchen and your dining room sound attractive? Perhaps you want to take out some ancient half wall you never much cared for. It could be that a temperamental load-bearing wall is the one thing that stands between you and your dream of an open concept floor plan. Whether you’re remodeling or renovating, knocking down a wall can create new opportunities in your home. However, it is a task that shouldn’t be taken lightly.\nThe aspiring DIYer can also take a crack at tearing down a wall. But if you plan to take down a wall on your own, there are few things you should know. Before you remove a wall, you should map out important things that could be lurking underneath the surface of your drywall. Both load-bearing and non-load-bearing are likely to contain electrical wiring running through them. They may also have water pipes running through them. Cost is another important factor to determine since it varies depending on what kind of wall you want to tear down.\nIt's important to double-check whether a wall is load-bearing or not. If a wall is a load-bearing wall, there will be tell-tale signs. The walls will line up with cinder blocks stacked underneath it in the basement, or support beams above it in the attic. Be very mindful of this, as some walls may look like non-load-bearing walls, but are in fact load-bearing. If you plan to remove a load-bearing wall, that wall must be replaced by steel beams to prevent structural problems.\nIn theory, DIYers with the right balance of caution and experience can remove a wall successfully. However, taking down a wall can get complicated, so if you don’t feel comfortable taking on such a project, it's a good idea to get a professional involved. And don’t worry about calling a pro halfway through an unfinished project. A licensed contractor should be more than happy to help you finish your home improvement project and create more space in your home.\nDo You Need a Permit to Knock Down a Wall?\nIn short, yes. A project that requires you to remove a wall is one for which you most likely need a permit. Any wall removal project that changes the size or shape of a room, removes or alters wiring or plumbing, or changes the structure of your house will need a permit.\nTaking Down a Non-Load-Bearing Wall\nNon-load-bearing walls usually cost between $300 and $1,000 to knock down. While it can get messy, it is perhaps the easiest DIY wall removal project. With diligent planning, you can take down a non-load-bearing wall in just two hours. Once you’ve checked that the wall you want to remove isn’t a load-bearing wall in disguise, it's just a matter of taking things down piece by piece. The main things to avoid are water pipes and electrical wires —you don’t want to damage those things and you don't want them to hurt you. Before you start cutting away sheetrock, it's important to switch off power to the electrical circuits in the area you will be working in. Any electrical outlets and light switches need to be removed before work begins. If you prefer not to mess with electrics, an electrician can do these steps for you and verify that the wires are safe. Make sure to shut off your water mains as well, or have a plumber help you out.\nOnce you’ve removed any doors or trim work from the wall, you should use a sharp utility knife to cut through paint and caulk where the wall meets the ceiling and other walls. This will prevent paint from peeling. Then, knock holes in the wall to make starter holes and cut away the drywall with a reciprocating saw. Be sure to avoid cutting pipes or wires! Now the drywall should pull free, and you can repeat this process for the other side of the wall. By the end, you will be left with a series of vertical planks called studs. Use the reciprocating saw to saw off these studs, and a hammer to pry off the top and bottom base plates. Be sure to bend or remove all nails from the base plates. You don’t want any sharp nails jutting out from the floor.\nTIP: When removing drywall, clear plastic sheeting can help contain dust. Sawdust is abrasive, so it’s also a good idea to wear a dust mask to avoid inhaling it.\nTaking Down a Load-Bearing Wall\nA structural engineer will charge between $1,200 and $3,000 to take out a load-bearing wall in a single-story house. If you happen to live in a multi-story house, the cost increases to between $3,200 and $10,000. For DIYers, taking down a load-bearing wall follows the same steps as a non-load-bearing wall. However, there are a few additional steps. When a load-bearing wall is removed, something needs to be put in its place to bear the load. You can use heavy lumber to produce vertical beams to suit this purpose, or you can even use steel. The main thing to calculate is how tall the beams will be. These beams will be below ceiling level since they will be supporting the roof or floor above. Figuring out how tall your beams should be can be challenging, but a structural engineer can help you cut through the guesswork. In the meantime, you can put in some temporary supports where the load-bearing wall stood to hold up your house. In any case, putting in beams is absolutely necessary. Otherwise, your ceiling and walls will gradually begin to sag, causing structural problems.\nTaking Down a Half Wall\nIf you hire a professional, taking down a half wall typically costs slightly less than a full non-load-bearing wall removal. Fortunately, it’s another one of the easier projects to complete on your own. The steps for knocking down a half wall (also known as a pony wall) are the same as for taking down a non-load-bearing wall. You’ll need to map out electrics, turn off electricity to this circuit, and remove any outlets or light switches before beginning. If you want to keep an outlet that was in your half wall, you can have it installed in a different wall by an electrician. You can also do this yourself. After cutting a new hole where you want the outlet to go, insert your hand into it to pull the cable for the outlet from its original to the new hole. When cutting excess cable, make sure you leave 6 inches of cable sticking out of the hole. You can then reinstall the outlet in its new home according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nGenerally, you can’t completely remove an exterior wall, especially not on your own. While your house can deal with a missing interior load-bearing wall (at least for a little while), it won’t cope very well with an entire exterior wall being torn down. Exterior walls are an integral part of your house’s structure, so if you plan to remove them you need to shore up your home’s structure first. Before that can be done, the exterior wall needs to be assessed for structural integrity. The only way to do this safely is to hire a licensed structural engineer. You will need a permit for this, and such a project can cost several thousand dollars. Don’t be discouraged though. It's normal for some projects to require a part of an external wall to be removed and definitely worth it for the added benefits of an addition to your home, like a little courtyard or balcony, for instance. It can be a fairly quick project completed successfully with a qualified professional.\nyou may also like"", 'What are the Building Regulations?\nThe Building Regulations apply to building work in England & Wales and set standards for the design and construction of buildings to ensure the safety and health for people in or about those buildings. They also include requirements to ensure that fuel and power is conserved and facilities are provided for people, including those with disabilities, to access and move around inside buildings.\nDo I need Building Regulations Approval? If you are planning to carry out ‘Building Work’ as defined in Regulation 3 of the Building Regulations, then it must comply with the Building Regulations. This normally means seeking approval of the work from a Building Control Body.\nThe following types of project amount to ‘Building Work’:\nThe erection or extension of a building\nAn alteration project involving work which will temporarily or permanently affect the ongoing compliance of the building, service or fitting with the requirements relating to structure, fire, or access to and use of buildings\nWhen installing replacement windows using a builder or window company not registered with the relevant Competent Person Schemes\nThe installation or extension of a service or fitting which is controlled under the regulations\nThe insertion of insulation into a cavity wall\nThe underpinning of the foundations of a building\nWhen you want to change the building’s fundamental use\nIf your building work consists only of the installation of certain types of services or fittings (e.g. electrical installations in dwellings, heating, hot water, air-conditioning and ventilation, replacement windows, WCs, and showers) and you employ an installer registered with a relevant Competent Person Schemes as designated in the Building Regulations, that installer will be able to self-certify the work. Therefore, you will not need to involve a Building Control Service. However, this concession is strictly limited to the specific type of installations and does not cover any other type of building work.\nThe works themselves must meet the current relevant technical requirements in the Building Regulations and they must not make other fabric, services and fittings less compliant than they were before – or dangerous. For example, the provision of replacement double-glazing must not make compliance worse in relation to means of escape, air supply for combustion appliances and their flues and ventilation for health.\nThey may also apply to certain changes of use of an existing building. This is because the change of use may result in the building as a whole no longer complying with the requirements which will apply to its new type of use, and so having to be up-graded to meet additional requirements specified in the regulations for which building work may also be required.\nWhere to get Building Regulations approval\nTo help you achieve compliance with the regulations, you are required to use one of two types of Building Control Service:\nyour local authority Building Control Service; or\nan approved inspector’s Building Control Service\nFailure to comply with the Building Regulations\nIf you do not follow the building control procedures set out for handling your building work or you carry out building work which does not comply with the requirements contained in the Building Regulations you will have contravened them.\nEnforcement Notices & Fines The local authority has a general duty to enforce the Building Regulations in its area and will seek to do so by informal means wherever possible.\nWhere an approved inspector is providing the Building Control Service, the responsibility for checking that the Building Regulations are complied with during the course of your building work will lie with that inspector. They will usually do this by advising you. However, approved inspectors do not have enforcement powers. Instead, the regulations provide that in a situation where they consider your building work does not comply with the Building Regulations they will not issue you with a final certificate and in addition will cancel the initial notice by notifying your local authority. If no other approved inspector takes on the work, the Building Control Service will automatically be taken on by your local authority. From this point on your local authority will also have enforcement powers to require you to alter your work, if they consider this necessary.\nIf a person carrying out building work contravenes the Building Regulations, the local authority or another person may decide to take them to the magistrates’ court where they could be fined up to £5000 for the contravention, and up to £50 for each day the contravention continues after conviction (section 35 of the Building Act 1984). This action will usually be taken against the builder or main contractor, and proceedings must be taken within two years from the completion of the work. Alternatively, or in addition, the local authority may serve an enforcement notice on the owner requiring them to alter or remove work which contravenes the regulations (section 36 of the 1984 Act). If the owner does not comply with the notice the local authority has the power to undertake the work itself and recover the costs of doing so from the owner.\nA section 36 enforcement notice cannot be served on you after the expiration of 12 months from the date of completion of the building work, but this does not affect a local authority’s (or any other person’s) right to apply to the Courts for an injunction for the same purpose. A local authority also cannot take enforcement action under section 36 if the work which you have carried out is in accordance with your plans which the authority approved or failed to reject within the statutory time of five weeks (or two months with your agreement) from deposit of the plans.\nImpact on Selling the Property Notwithstanding the possibility of enforcement action, you should bear in mind that if the local authority considers that building work carried out does not comply with the Building Regulations and it is not rectified, the authority will not issue you with a completion certificate and the contravention may come to light through a local land search enquiry when you wish to sell your property.\nIs Building Regulations approval the same as planning permission?\nBuilding Regulations approval is a separate matter from obtaining planning permission for your work. Similarly, receiving any planning permission which your work may require is not the same as taking action to ensure that it complies with the Building Regulations.\nCall Us On +44 20 8886 6591']"	['<urn:uuid:fa67a163-f772-47de-af13-9ad958ed95b0>', '<urn:uuid:5f0a3955-8d2b-4a1b-b86d-bc0b8e69d45e>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	6	88	2374
18	film completion problems examples lost projects cases	Two notable examples of troubled film completions are: The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, which stopped after just two days of filming due to financial issues, health problems and weather disasters; and The Other Side of the Wind, left unfinished when Orson Welles died during editing, leading to complicated ownership disputes and rights issues that have prevented its completion despite having most footage shot and detailed editing notes from the director.	"['|ROGUE GENIUS: An Orson Welles\nSponsored by the Hollywood\nForeign Press Association\nWhere do you begin with Orson Welles, a man with a talent and\nimagination so prodigious that he spanned radio, films, television, books, theater and\nexcelled in them all? From his first film masterpiece CITIZEN KANE - more often than not\ndescribed as one of the best movies ever made - to his checkered career fighting for\nfunding to realize his directorial vision, Welles stands alone, holding a special place in\nthe pantheon of cinematic greats. Welles himself (in F FOR FAKE) made the self-deprecating\nremark, ""I began at the top and have been working my way down ever since,""\nreferring to the popular misconception that his post-KANE career somehow never\ndelivered on his initial promise. In reality, Welles delivered again and again on that\npromise, in such dazzling and unexpected ways that audiences, critics and other filmmakers\nare still trying to catch up. How else can one describe a career that encompasses such\nfilms as THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI, OTHELLO, TOUCH OF EVIL, THE\nTRIAL, an astonishingly rich legacy of television (including ""The Fountain Of\nYouth""), as well as legendary ""unfinished"" films such as THE OTHER SIDE OF\nTHE WIND and DON QUIXOTE? Although he had to jump through bigger and bigger hoops to\nsecure financing for his movies, dealing with an industry used to mediocrity, somehow he\nmanaged to create and put his art in the public eye for over four decades. A brilliantly\ndramatic actor, always delivering a droll performance with seemingly little effort, he was\na genius director, capable of creating works that were simultaneously tragic, elegiac,\nlyrical, satirical, playfully surreal and pulpy, miraculously managing to integrate all\nthese traits into a style that is immediately recognizable as ""Wellesian."" (Note: Welles CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT is currently unavailable for\nscreening, so unfortunately, we were not able include it in this retrospective.)\nWere enormously pleased to welcome\nStefan Droessler, director of the Munich Filmmuseum, which has amassed the worlds\nlargest collection of rare Welles materials, working closely with the filmmakers\nlong-time companion Oja Kodar. Mr. Droessler will present six different programs,\norganized around various themes, using clips from TV shows directed by Welles, guest\nappearances and cameos in movies and on TV, scenes from his uncompleted projects, and more\nmost never before seen in Los Angeles.\nFriday, February 13 7:30 PM\nCITIZEN KANE, 1941, Warner Bros.,\n119 min. Orson Welles was only 25 when he directed this masterpiece, and it remains\none of the most phenomenal motion pictures ever made. Trailblazing in so many aspects,\nfrom Gregg Tolands complex camera and lighting to Bernard Herrmanns score to\none of the finest ensemble casts (including Welles, Joseph Cotten, Everett Sloane and\nAgnes Moorehead) ever assembled.

The camera is the star in one of director Orson Welles most\nphantasmagorical films, a dazzling noir thriller about a seaman, a crippled lawyer and his\nhomicidal wife pursuing each other through a ""bright, guilty world"" of\ninfidelity, deception and murder. The hall of mirrors climax is riveting. With Orson\nWelles, Rita Hayworth and Everett Sloane.\nSunday, February 15 4:00 PM\nOTHELLO, 1952, Castle Hill, 92 min.\nUntil its 1992 restoration, Welles wildly imaginative Shakespearean adaptation\nwas often overlooked, and nearly impossible to see in a decent print. Despite its initial\nbudgetary problems, which caused the shooting schedule to stretch out over three years (it\nwas started in 1949), it stands as one of Welles greatest visual poems. An\nastonishing achievement against nearly overwhelming odds. Starring Welles, Micheál\nMacLiammóir, Suzanne Cloutier.\nSunday, February 15 6:30 PM\nTOUCH OF EVIL, 1958, Universal,\n111 min. Orson Welles hallucinatory, off-kilter masterwork stars Charlton\nHeston in one of his finest roles as a Mexican policeman trapped on the wrong side of\nthe border, where a corpulent, corrupt cop (Welles) tries to stop him from digging into\nthe past.

Franz Kafkas\nclassic novel of paranoia and conspiracy seems tailor-made for Orson Welles. A\nlabyrinthine, deliciously satiric, nightmare vision of a man (Anthony Perkins) accused of\nan unspecified crime that emerges as a subtle allegory of Welles own Catch\n22-tribulations working in the film industry.

The program\nincludes a clip from Edward Sutherlands FOLLOW THE BOYS, (1944, Universal, 5\nmin.) with Orson Welles and Marlene Dietrich performing his stage magic show; a rarely\nseen episode of the ""I Love Lucy"" show, where Lucy meets Orson Welles\n(1956, CBS TV, 26 min.); restored material from the\nunfinished MAGIC SHOW he was filming from 1976 until the end of his life; and more.\nStefan Droessler of the Munich\nFilm Archive to introduce the screening.\nFriday, February 20 9:30 PM\nTHE WELLES RARITIES Program 2: ""People\nAll his life Orson Welles liked to travel,\nand in his films and television work he very often portrayed people and places in Europe\nfor British or American audiences. In this program we see Welles visiting Paris, Italy and\nLondon, finding outsiders, film stars and typical Britains, who were interviewed (as well\nas occasionally impersonated!) by Welles himself. The episodes of ORSON WELLES\nLONDON (1968-71) are among the funniest comedy pieces he ever did.

In all the mediums and\nfilm forms, he loved to play this part: as invisible director in the CITIZEN\nKANE trailer (1941), interfering with the action as host in his legendary\ntelevision project ""THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH"" (1956, Desilu\nProductions/Viacom, 25 min.), or as pure storyteller in front of a camera in\nTHE GOLDEN HONEYMOON (1971).

The film had been cut by 21 minutes, re-recorded to\n""Americanize"" the dialogue, and then rarely shown. Gitt tracked down the missing\nfootage and original, Scottish-accented soundtrack, plus the Jacques Ibert overture and\nexit music. Critic Stanley Kauffman wrote about the restoration: ""Whatever the\ndetails of Gitts job, Welles MACBETH is now a bold, exciting, innovative\nfilm."" The innovations cannot be overstated. Longtime Welles collaborator Richard\nWilson considered MACBETH ""the greatest experimental American film ever made under\nthe Hollywood studio system,"" and the restored footage includes a reel-long take. The\nstudio was driven mad by the many retakes the ten-minute sequence required. Eight parts\nWelles to two parts Shakespeare, MACBETH was shot around Salt Lake City and features\nlow-budget grandiosity, plus Welles in an intense, towering performance as the tormented\nScots king, ""one of the best elements of the film, thrilling and a bit poignant\nIn every one of the big moments, Welles rises to the heroic.""

Hoberman, Village Voice), CONFIDENTIAL REPORT\nretains the investigative structure of CITIZEN KANE the life of a rich and powerful\nman is recounted by several people who knew him but replaces KANEs tragic\nromanticism with a sordidness that is so far over the top as not to be believed. A\nruthless financier (Welles) hires a sleazy young cigarette smuggler to write a\n""confidential report"" on his past, hoping to erase the last traces of his infamy\nso that his beloved daughter will never find the truth about him. Welles decks out this\nmock-tragic ""chronicle of a death foretold"" with down n dirty rococo\neffects and tall tales, including that epitome of cynicism, the fable about the frog and\nthe scorpion. There are several distinct versions of the film we will be screening\na new print of the CONFIDENTIAL REPORT version. (Program notes courtesy James\nTHE BIG BRASS RING, 1999, Nu\nImage, 104 min. Dir.

In THE BIG BRASS RING, the screenplay Orson\nWelles co-wrote with Oja Kodar in 1982, Welles was meditating with prophetic\nenergy on American fate and the nature of power by telling the story of political\ncandidate Blake Pellarin, who is haunted by his past and settling scores with his\nenigmatic mentor, Kim Mennaker. Many years later, the previously unproduced script was\nadapted by director George Hickenlooper (THE MAN FROM ELYSIAN FIELDS, THE MAYOR OF\nSUNSET STRIP) and screenwriter F.X. Feeney, with a stellar cast including William\nHurt, Nigel Hawthorne, Miranda Richardson and Irene Jacob. ""THE BIG\nBRASS RING struck me as an opportunity to both pay a debt to an artist I revere and yet\ndramatize something deeply related to my own experience.

(Program notes courtesy Stefan Droessler/Munich Filmmuseum.)\nIntroduction to THE BIG BRASS RING by director\nGeorge Hickenlooper and screenwriter F.X. Feeney.', '(Apologies. This article was intended to be published several weeks ago, but, due to circumstances beyond my control was not completed until now.)\n“Wait, wait, I\'m not finished.”\nWe\'ve all experienced that helpless feeling of not being able to complete a task that is expected of us. In our industry there are countless unfinished masterpieces and abandoned projects galore. It seems inevitable that somewhere in your career you\'ll encounter something that you\'re involved in that stops while incomplete or never gets where it was going. This article intends to explore some of those circumstances and evaluate what happens next, what the consequences and responsibilities involved are for the incomplete projects in our lives.\nThe incomplete screenwriter\nIf you\'re a screenwriter you likely have lots of incomplete scripts in your files. Ideas that started as specs and abandoned for whatever reason; the screenplay premise didn\'t stand up to a full script treatment, the idea was done by someone else before you could finish, the dreaded “writer\'s block."" When it is a spec idea that we\'re attempting for ourselves the fallout of leaving a script incomplete is simple. Since no one was waiting for it, abandoning it doesn\'t impact anyone\'s expectations or waste anyone else\'s time or money. The worst potential damage is you kicking yourself for wasting time on something you can\'t take to the next stage.\nBut if that script you were working on wasn\'t a spec and someone else was counting on the delivery of a completed draft by a certain date, then you\'ll likely have more of a substantial problem not finishing it. When a party buys your pitch or hires you to write a draft there\'s a contractual expectation and obligation for you to deliver.\nRegular readers of these columns have heard me extol on the importance of knowing the terms of the contracts involved in your dealings in this business. It is in the interest of both sides of an agreement to fully understand the terms of the deal. Clarity of terms allows you to know exactly what is expected of you and when per the contract. Failing to meet those deadlines and conditions results in… bad things.\nWhen a party to an agreement fails to meet the requirements of an agreed upon term of the contract that party is said to be in breach. If the writer was expected to turn in a complete new draft on Monday and here it is Tuesday afternoon and no draft has been delivered, the producer has a right to be upset. What the producer can do at this point can depend on the rest of the terms of the agreement.\nIf the contract is mum on what happens if a party breaches, then traditionally the entire agreement is ended. How that affects both parties can be quite dire so usually there are terms in the contract that discuss ways of dealing with a breach to keep something of the original deal alive.\nCuring the breach is the contractually defined conditions where the breaching party, by specific terms laid out in the text, may be able to recover from the faux pas and restore the conditions of the agreement going forward. Usually the language used in a curing of a breach section is quite heavily in favor of the non-breaching party. Often the specific way a breach must be cured, and in what time frame are stated. Or the non-breaching party is given full discretion as to how to set terms to get the agreement back on track and the breaching party must abide by them to make amends.\nTypical ways breaches can be cured include penalties of some kind for the breaching party, an extremely tight deadline to deliver what was promised, significant oversight of the breaching party\'s operations in curing the breach by the non-breaching party until resolved (and maybe for the rest of the contract term), and/or damages compensating the non-breaching party for any losses caused by the breach and the recovery.\nIt is sometimes possible for the non-breaching party to decide to grant a waiver, ignoring the contractual requirement that led to the breach as if it wasn\'t part of the deal. If a waiver is available, it is often defined as an option for the non-breaching party in the original terms of the contract. Usually that language will stipulate whether the waiver, once granted will always apply in future contractual terms (e.g. a repeating event.) This is the default of a waiver if no other language counters. Often there is included the stipulation that granting a discretionary waiver once has no affect on future interpretations of the contract. As always the specifics of the contractual language rule.\nWhat this boils down to is that the one who breaches a contract is at best left to the mercy of the other party, which, since you are disappointing or inconveniencing them isn\'t likely to be favorable.\nOther fallout of not completing a script\nEven after considering the direct, legal ramifications of an incomplete script assignment, there are many other career aspects that suffer if you don\'t deliver. Even if the other contractual party allows you to continue after missing a deadline there is the potential loss of other contractual advantages (right to further drafts, credits, right to be first in line to write sequel) that may result from the incomplete. Then there\'s the damage to your reputation. News travels fast about who is capable and who has problems delivering in this industry. It\'s hard to get a second chance when you didn\'t turn in the first one.\nThe damages differ from delivering a draft that isn\'t good or liked. If you at least turn over a legitimate script (not 120 blank pages) that doesn\'t live up to the creative expectations of the producers, you still have lived up to your obligations to deliver. Though it is likely your reputation will still take a hit, there are many reasons why a script draft fails to please and many of those are situational or personal. One person\'s trash is another\'s treasure and all that. But if you don\'t deliver anything it\'s pretty clear where the problem lies.\nThe incomplete filmmaker\nAnd the fear of failing to complete a project doesn\'t end with the script delivery. Filmmakers are constantly under the gun to deliver and there are a myriad of reasons why a film project might end up incomplete. When the producers start to get nervous are when the film is about to (or already has) gone over budget or over schedule or both. A runaway train is sometimes only stopped by crashing. While in production, a line producer\'s traditional role is to monitor the daily production aspects that affect the bottom line and delivery date. Certain extra expenditures are expected and even anticipated. That\'s why a good film budget always should have a hefty contingency line item. It\'s a significant portion of the budget\'s funds (sometimes upwards of 20%) that isn\'t allocated to any department but is there to have ready funds to handle emergencies or unexpected rises in costs. If it rains on the exterior shoot days and there\'s no work around, the extra days lost are paid out of this. There\'s a certain flexibility built in to modern production budgets. But those only go so far.\nCompletion bond and the incomplete film\nThe fact that there is a lot of someone else\'s money on the line (both above and below) adds to the producers\' nervousness. Not to mention the nerves of those whose money is being spent each day. That\'s why most investors in film require some form of insurance that they won\'t lose everything they spend on a production if things go wrong. A completion bond is an insurance policy that something will be available for the investors from the result of spending all that money on the production. The bond assures the investors that at the end they will either have a completed film or their money back.\nBefore a film is bonded a completion bond company assesses that there is a strong likelihood the players in place will be able to complete the film. If you hear that a film cannot get insurance because one of the principals, say a lead actor or director, isn\'t healthy enough it\'s likely that the bond company determined the risk is too great and the potential cost if the sickly person died while filming is too high to assure the film will be completed. If a bond company does take on a project they do so with significant power to act as they see fit when trouble threatens the completion of the film. There\'s no guarantee that the investors will have a film that they can make money with let alone make their money back but they will have an asset with which to try.\nA bond company usually has two options for salvaging a film heading for trouble: 1) they can decide to step in and make changes to the production team, budget, structure or anything else they feel would assure the completion of the film. Or 2) the bond company can determine that it\'s a lost cause and the film cannot be completed as things stand (and with money spent) and decide to pay the investors back what they\'ve spent. Bond companies prefer situation number 1 most of the time and will step in and finish “a” film, maybe not anything like it was intended to be, but, it will be complete.\nAs you can see, a bond company has a strong motivation to keep tabs on a film\'s development. They are often the first to sound the flag on overspending or trouble brewing. Just another reason why so many filmmakers are paranoid about going over budget or schedule. They don\'t want to lose control of the film they\'ve worked so hard to create. In the best scenarios the bond company collects its fee and does nothing. The film is delivered close enough to on time and budget to please the money people and creatives alike. But occasionally that\'s not always the case.\nExample 1: The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\nSometimes an incomplete film is a product of shaky financial structure security and bad luck.\nAt the beginning of the millennium Terry Gilliam was set to direct a long gestating pet project of his, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote based on the Cervantes masterpiece. After years of trying different approaches he finally raised the millions needed from a large, cobbled together group of investors and set out to film in Spain. Through fits of bad health, weather and location issues, after only two days of actual shooting the plug was pulled on the project. The chain of minor disasters and the skittish, many handed investor group led to the film\'s initial stoppage. In what was supposed to be a typical behind the scenes video documentary, the tumble of events were wonderfully (or horribly?) captured in detail in the award winning documentary Lost In La Mancha.\nIt has taken many years and several attempts for Gilliam to get control back of his film from the shambles of that original attempt. And it is not clear yet that he will be able to finally complete the picture even with the backing of Amazon Studios this time. The latest hurdle is that his current star, John Hurt\'s health is problematic in getting the film insured.\nExample 2: The Other Side of the Wind\nA completely different way to end up with an incomplete film is when the driving force behind its creation dies before completing it.\nThe Other Side of the Wind is a (so far) incomplete film that Orson Welles was working on throughout the last decades of his life. He shot bits and pieces of the film over the course of several years, whenever he could raise enough money to get a bit more done. He was in the process of editing it when he died back in the mid-eighties.\nAs is the case with most incomplete film projects there are an awful lot of people with various vested interests involved in it that would like to see a finished product. In this case, Welles had shot all the footage he thought he needed to complete the film and had actually created about 40 minutes or so of rough cut scenes as well as created detailed notes as to how he envisioned the rest of the film was to go. With no real missing pieces it should be a simple matter of bringing the elements together to finish the work. As often the case in Hollywood when it comes to what should be simple, it\'s not.\nFor this instance the first question was, “Who owned the film?” There were many vying parties from the people who put up some of the financing to the stars of the film to those who worked hard on the technical ends. The story is chronicled well up to the most recent turn of events in the recent book by Josh Karp, Orson Welles\'s Last Movie: The Making of The Other Side of the Wind. Since it\'s publication there has been a resurge in people attempting to raise funds and get rights to finish the edit as Welles intended and get his last work out to the masses. But even now, stumbling block keep rising up.\nWhat\'s a filmmaker or writer to do?\nWhen a guiding force for a film falls, the wind is knocked out of the sails. And if that leader had a tendency to fly by the seat of his pants in dealing with people and properties trying to get his film made, even with his original charts and plans the depths of the waters of complications ahead can be treacherous. Claims of ownership have to be investigated and either supported or debunked. Claims of debts owed against the film have to be dealt with in a similar manner. Angry participants should be quelled so as to not make more troubles. Worried family members and friends must be satiated that the end product will still honor the memories and intentions of the original creator. And you still have to deal with the regular uncertainties of trying to bring a film to market and reach an audience. Only an extremely dedicated (and lucky) group can succeed under such circumstances.\nA prudent scheme for a provider of source material for a film, be it a spec script or other work, is to contractually obligate a production deadline for a completed film by a certain date or the rights revert back to the originator. It\'s basically like a completion bond for the creative efforts instead of the financial expenditures. And a filmmaker should make sure that the chain of ownership and control is clearly defined and adhered to in the event the unforeseen does happen. That way there isn\'t a delay for resolving the murky control issues before a remounting of the project can begin.\nAn incomplete analysis\nIt\'s the nature of the complexity of possibilities that this article has to be an incomplete analysis of all the possible ways you can reach the dead end on your incomplete script or project. There are many other possible problems that could arise from not being able to finish what was started. The best you can hope for is to plan for the possibility that something might not be finished and put in place contingencies. Because as always, it depends.\n- More articles by Christopher Schiller\n- Balls of Steel: Liar, Liar, Career on Fire\n- Script Tips: Deadlines Make Scripts Better, Every Time!\nScreenwriter Contracts DecodedUnderstand Common Screenwriting Contract Terms so\nYou can Sign Your Contract Confidently']"	['<urn:uuid:dd5d4a44-5278-4758-b6b2-f719f64c1c37>', '<urn:uuid:0901a92f-3a08-4c71-b228-18f94dd95373>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	7	71	5320
19	economic activities comparison wallis futuna islands suffolk sheep farming income sources	Wallis and Futuna has a poorly developed economy where residents mainly rely on subsistence farming, with additional support from French authorities for defense, medical care, and employment opportunities, including higher salaries for French civil servants. In contrast, Suffolk sheep farming offers multiple income streams: they are primarily raised for meat production (lambs typically sold at 90-120 pounds), while also providing secondary income through wool production (5-8 pounds per sheep) and potential dairy products, particularly gourmet cheese production, though this is less common due to limited processing facilities.	"['Of the 245 sovereigns, associated countries and overseas possessions, there are the smallest populations. Each of them has its characteristics of economic development, history, culture; they try to preserve identity and life principles.\nIn the list below is an overview of the ten smallest countries in terms of population. Some of them also have a small record territory.\n1. Pitcairn Islands, 40 people\nFive islands in the South Pacific Ocean cover a total area of 47km2 and belong to the overseas territory of Great Britain. Inhabited is only Pitcairn, which characterizes by cliffs and rugged coastline. Volcanoes, fortunately, are no longer active. Tourism brings 80% of the revenue to the local treasury\nThe Pitcairn island is unique. Henderson, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 4 rare species of birds live here, about ten species of endemics grow. Ecology is not affected by human influence.\n2. Vatican City, 825 people\nThe state within the territory of Rome is associated with Italy. The Vatican maintains diplomatic relations with 170 countries of the world. This small country is the centre of government of the Catholic Church, to which about 1 billion believers on our planet rank themselves. The official languages are Italian and Latin.\nThe population of the city-country mainly made up of church ministers, Swiss guards and their families. Men make up 95% of the citizens. Almost 5 million tourists visit the Vatican every year.\n3. Tokelau, 1499 people\nThree small islands in the Pacific Ocean administered by New Zealand, which provides significant aid to the dependent state. The limestone soil is suitable for pandanus and coconut trees. The surface of the atolls made up of coral debris.\nA small income for the treasury is brought by the production of souvenir coins and postage stamps. Also, the country’s economy is developing at the expense of the national domain zone. Interestingly, the islands have recently decided to switch to solar energy as a source of electricity altogether.\n4. Niue, 1,620 people\nThe self-governing state of Niue Fecaia covers 261 sq. km and is in free association with New Zealand. Almost all issues, except for foreign policy and defence, are resolved independently. 81% are indigenous people.\nFrom April to October, the island is at the mercy of the strongest storms. Intense cyclones observed about once every ten years. The tourism sector is at the beginning of development, which is the main direction in the authorities’ work.\n5. Falkland Islands, 3398 people\nArgentina disputes rights to the British Overseas Territory in the Southwest Atlantic. The coastline stretches for 1,300 km. The total area of numerous islands and rocks is 12,173 sq. km. Life is concentrated in the most extensive formations – West and East Falkland.\nDue to the constantly blowing strong winds, rare trees bend and take on bizarre shapes. The archipelago’s economy based on sheep breeding, industrial fishing, fish processing, tourism and agriculture.\nMost of the island’s territory used as pasture land for 500,000 sheep. The islands are also famous for their population of penguins, of which there are more than seven hundred thousand.\n6. Saint Helena, 4534 people\nThe British Overseas Territory locates on islands of volcanic origin. The primary and permanent population concentrated on the island of Saint Helena, where Bonaparte once spent his last days. The flow of tourists does not stop here.\nOfficials and military personnel with their families stationed on Ascension Island. Once the island was famous for the abundance of endemic plants, many are now on the verge of extinction. Interestingly, the two houses of Napoleon and the place of his burial – the Vallee of theTomb are the possession of France.\n7. Montserrat, 4694 people\nThe British Overseas Territory locates on the leeward island, the part chain known as the Lesser Antilles, in the West Indies. Eight thousand residents forced to leave their homeland in 1995 when there was an increase in seismic activity. People have abandoned the administrative centre – the city of Plymouth. The southern half of the island is still inaccessible to people.\nThe country’s economy has traditionally based on tourism. In addition, sugarcane, citrus fruits and vegetables were grown here. The production of rum, textiles was established on the island, and factories for the assembly of electrical equipment were in operation.\nNow the economic activity is at the stage of revival. The population is gradually returning; farmland is being restored, new houses being build.\n8. Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, 6008 people\nThe French overseas community locates on small islands in the Atlantic Ocean. Most of the foodstuffs, household goods, and fuel imported. There are no conditions for agriculture: the soil is not fertile, the humidity is high, the sun’s heat and light are not enough. The inhabitants of the country are mainly engaged in fishing and processing their catch. Chickens, sheep and pigs can be found in households.\nThe land surface covers with steep hillsides, numerous boulders, dunes and swampy areas. Due to the peculiarities of the weather and the relief, you can hardly find trees here.\n9. Wallis and Futuna, 11 558 people\nThe territory of the overseas community of France in the Pacific divides into three kingdoms, two of which are on the island. Wallis and Futuna are one of the isles. Tourists attracted by untouched coral reefs, fabulously beautiful Catholic cathedrals, the richest flora and fauna in the coastal waters.\nThe economy poorly developed. The population strives to provide for their families through subsistence farming. The French authorities take care of the island’s defence, medical care, the creation of communications, and providing residents with work. French civil servants who arrived on the islands under contract are paid double or triple their salary.\n10. Tuvalu, 11646 people\nThe Pacific state of Tuvalu, a member of the British Commonwealth, is scattered over eight coral islands. The total land area is 26 sq. km., the distance between the islands is 50-100 km. The country’s main export products are copra and frozen fish.\nThe main occupation of the local population is subsistence farming and fishing. Food and consumer goods, fuel and equipment, are imported here.', ""Try Suffolk Sheep for Meat and Wool on the Farm\nSuffolk Sheep Breeders Raise a Sheep Breed That's Ideal for all Climates\nReading Time: 4 minutes\nSuffolk sheep were first recognized in 1797 in sheep breed books. Since 1888, the Suffolk sheep have traveled to new continents and become a staple of American and Canadian sheep farms. The large breed, black faced sheep was developed in England. Originally, a Norfolk horned ewe was bred to a Southdown ram. The offspring of the original cross breeding resulted in a polled lamb.\nSuffolk sheep quickly became America’s most common breed of sheep. The breed background of the prolific Norfolk ewe brought extreme hardiness to the Suffolk breed. The Norfolk also had the black face, horns and large size. Even the meat of the Norfolk breed was prized. However, the Norfolk had poor conformation. The early breeders matched the Norfolk with the Southdown and came up with the future Suffolk breed. As often happens with crossbreeding, the offspring gathered up the best of both breeds. The black, open face, bare legs, and beautiful large build makes the Suffolk an attractive sheep. Unlike the Norfolk, the Suffolk is a polled breed, meaning no horns. The calm disposition of the Suffolk sheep makes them a popular choice for 4H clubs and family farms.\nHow Large do Suffolk Sheep Grow?\nThe Suffolk sheep grow to a large size range of 180 to 250 pounds in ewes. The rams can reach a hefty 350 pounds! A fairly long lifespan of 11 to 13 years and the excellent fertility rate adds to the popular features. The majority of farms keep the Suffolk sheep for meat production. The lambs are typically sold or butchered at 90 to 120 pounds. The lamb and mutton both are thought to have excellent taste, texture, and flavor. In some cases, cross breeding with other breeds increases the genetic benefits. The Welsh Mountain sheep are named as a breed that increases the meat production in the lambs. Using a Suffolk ram and a Welsh Mountain ewe is a common way to improve the Suffolk sheep flock.\nSuffolk Sheep are Easy Keepers\nAll sheep, no matter if they grow fleece or are a hair breed, are herbivores. They rely on eating grass, leaves, hay and scrub growth. Having beautiful green pastures of field grass is wonderful, but not the only way to raise sheep. The Suffolk sheep is hardy and resourceful. Even sparse, scrubby pastures can be enough for the Suffolk sheep breed, as long as the nutritional needs are met. Meeting the nutritional requirements can be achieved by feeding hay and some commercial grain rations meant for sheep. Suffolk sheep are resistant to parasites. The breed also does well in conditions ranging from damp to dry pastures or paddocks.\nGestation and Lambing\nGestation in the Suffolk lasts 145 to 155 days. Twins are very common and to be expected. Most sheep farmers will hold off breeding the ewe until eight months of age, although they reach sexual maturity around six months. The rams reach sexual maturity around five months. Be sure and separate your first-year kids before the rams become able to impregnate the new ewes. Breeding very young ewes can lead to higher incidence of pregnancy difficulties. Once the Suffolk ewe is mature, it is possible to breed her twice a year, yielding four to six lambs, in many cases.\nSuffolk Sheep Milk and Wool Fleece Products\nWhile the Suffolk is not known to be a dairy sheep breed, the milk is used by some breeders to make an upscale cheese sold in gourmet shops. Sheep milk has double the protein of cow’s milk and a higher concentration of milk solids overall. The higher percentage of milk solids means sheep milk makes a delicious cheese from less milk. Still, most people do not rely on the Suffolk ewes for their milk supply. One disadvantage for sheep dairy production is a lack of facilities to process sheep milk. Most sheep milk is used by the Suffolk sheep breeder‘s family in smaller quantities.\nWhile all the great meat production is going strong, another marketable product is being produced. Fleece and fiber production is another byproduct of raising any meat breed of sheep. The fleece can be used by commercial fiber mills or by hand spinners to obtain even more return from the investment in the flock. Shearing must be done once a year anyway, so the fleece should be used somehow. (Breeds such as the Katahdin sheep, are a meat breed that does not require shearing)\nThe Suffolk is considered a downy breed of wool producer. Hand spinners can definitely find a good amount of usable fleece to spin into yarn with the sheared fleece. The medium grading refers to the rating of a few factors of the fleece. The staple length, meaning the length of the fibers is two to 3.5 inches long. The micron count, 25 to 33 microns, makes it a medium grade wool. Each animal yields about five to eight pounds of usable fleece of which an average of 50 to 60 percent is usable. Even though the sheared wool can be used, Suffolk sheep are not usually considered when raising sheep for wool. Most of the Suffolk wool is sent to commercial processing. The Suffolk sheep breeders usually don’t take the effort needed to produce hand spinning fleece. (source: The Fleece and Fiber Sourcebook by Deborah Robson and Carol Ekarius, Storey Publishing, 2011)\nSuffolk sheep are the right choice when looking to raise lamb and mutton. A field of grazing Suffolk sheep is a beautiful sight, with their large, stocky size and black and white color pattern. With proper care, milk and wool can be usable products obtained from the Suffolk breed, too. Have you considered this breed for your farm?""]"	['<urn:uuid:0da696ca-b650-42f9-b3e6-9a91f785e9ef>', '<urn:uuid:61bc2913-a0ef-42e4-b6f1-355a6fcbdf03>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	11	87	1980
20	food sources postbiotic compounds gut microbes	Postbiotics are metabolic byproducts that probiotic bacteria produces while feeding on prebiotic fiber. Examples include butyrate, which serves as a major energy source for the colon, and hydrogen peroxide, which is produced by Lactobacillus johnsonii bacteria and may help kill salmonella.	['Prebiotics are forms of dietary fiber you can obtain from a variety of different foods and from supplements.\nThis type of fiber plays an important role in good health by supporting and enhancing the activity of the probiotic bacteria living in the guts.\nIn order to understand why prebiotics are important, it’s necessary to first realize the important role probiotics play within the intestinal tract and how their activity benefits the overall health.\nWhat Is Probiotic Bacteria and Why Does It Need Prebiotics?\nProbiotic bacteria is a term that encompasses certain bacteria that lives in the intestines. The intestines contain a lot of different strains of bacteria.\nSome types can harm the health, others are beneficial. The “good” type of bacteria is known as probiotic bacteria. It’s also sometimes referred to as flora.\nThe good and bad bacteria in the guts are like two opposing forces in a war. When the bad bacteria starts to gain ground it can impact the health in many negative ways.\nDiarrhea, weight gain, fatigue, and skin problems are just a few of the problems that may result from a build-up of bad bacteria in the gut.\nWhen the intestines contain more good bacteria than bad bacteria it improves gut health, enforces the immune system and provides other health benefits that contribute to a sense of greater well-being.\nAlthough probiotic bacteria occurs naturally within the digestive tract, certain foods, such as feta cheese and sauerkraut, contain it too. Eating such food increases the amount of good bacteria present in the intestines by adding more.\nConsuming probiotic food, drinks, and supplements is a good way to top up your levels of good bacteria. Doing so has become an increasingly popular practice in recent years.\nConsuming prebiotic food and supplements is another way to increase the amount of probiotic bacteria present in the guts. Like any other organism, bacteria has to be fed. Prebiotics feed probiotic bacteria, thereby helping it to multiply.\nWhat’s So Special about Prebiotic Fiber?\nAlthough all forms of dietary fiber are good for the health, not all fiber is prebiotic.\nThe body cannot digest prebiotic fiber. What the body cannot use, the probiotic bacteria can. When it enters the intestines the bacteria feasts on it and multiplies.\nIn order to be classed as a prebiotic, fiber has to be able to resist small-intestinal absorption, be fermented by probiotic bacteria, and stimulate its growth.\nIf your diet lacks enough of this type of important fiber, the amount of good bacteria present in the intestines may dwindle and your health will suffer.\nAlthough probiotic bacteria gets all the glory, prebiotics are the important silent partner that helps make everything possible.\nBy enhancing probiotic activity in the way that they do, prebiotics can support good health in numerous ways.\nSome examples include:\n- Improves nutrient absorption\n- Reduces levels of potentially pathogenic bacteria\n- Increases the metabolism\n- Promotes fat loss\n- Increases energy\n- Improves immune function\n- Reduces inflammation\n- Supports healthy bowel action\nThe fact that prebiotics are a form of fiber also gives them value in other areas. For instance, food that is high in fiber helps fill the stomach, satiate the appetite, and prevent hunger cravings. [SOURCE 1, SOURCE 2]\nIt’s also important to remember the foods that provide prebiotics are generally a good source of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other nutrients. They are not solely prebiotic fiber. The fiber is what is left when all the other nutrients have been digested. Prebiotic food also tends to be very low in fat.\nIn short, the foods that provide prebiotic fiber tend to be healthy options that can support good health in many ways. They do much more than feed probiotic bacteria so it’s important not to underestimate their value or sell them short.\nPrebiotics + Probiotics = Postbiotics\nAs far as the pecking order goes, probiotics have always been the big star when it comes to gut health. Then prebiotics gradually nudged their way into the scene. More recently, researchers have discovered a new name in gut health—postbiotics.\nPostbiotics are the metabolic byproducts probiotic bacteria produces while feeding on prebiotic fiber.\nIt appears some of these byproducts such as butryate (a major energy source for the colon), may actually be responsible for some of the benefits that have previously been directly attributed to probiotics.\nHydrogen peroxide is another postbiotic compound that appears to offer value to the health. It’s produced by the Lactobacillus johnsonii strain of bacteria and research suggests it kills salmonella.\nSo, it appears the way probiotics work may not be as clear-cut as it appears. It’s also apparent there’s a need for a lot more research into the complex subject of gut bacteria and how it affects the overall health. [SOURCE 3, SOURCE 4, SOURCE 5]\nExamples of Prebiotics – Natural Sources\nPrebiotic foods are plant-based. So vegans and vegetarians are likely to already be getting enough of this valuable form of natural fiber.\nSome good prebiotic foods include:\n- Apple cider vinegar\n- Jerusalem artichokes\n- Whole wheat products\nSo, when your mother told you it was important you eat all your greens it was good advice.\nA Closer Look at Inulin and FOS\nThere’s more than one type of prebiotic fiber. That’s why you may encounter a lot of talk about inulin and FOS.\nInulin is a water-soluble fiber that’s low in calories. Chicory and Jerusalem artichoke are particularly good sources of inulin.\n|Inulin / 100g|\nFOS (fructooligosaccharides) is also known as oligofructose and oligofructan. So, if you encounter any of these names they refer to the same thing. Due to its sweet-tasting nature, FOS has value as an artificial sweetener and is slightly different from inulin on a molecular level.\nMost of the FOS and inulin manufacturers add to supplements is extracted from chicory roots or manufactured from sucrose.\nIn recent years, a high performance (HP) form of inulin has become available. It’s a synthetic ingredient that’s less sweet but has more power.\nHowever, although many pill type supplements may use synthetic ingredients, most of the better shake-type supplements and health drinks contain natural ingredients. For this reason, they offer higher nutritional value and are arguably a better option.\nPrebiotic Suitability and Side Effects\nPrebiotic foods and supplements are extremely healthy and good for the body. However, a certain amount of discretion is necessary. Going overboard and overdoing it with prebiotics can cause excess build-ups of intestinal gas. Bloating and some degree of stomach discomfort may also be possible.\nPeople who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or other intestinal conditions will need to use prebiotics with extra care.\nBefore making major changes to the diet or using supplements for the first time it’s always a good idea to consult a doctor first. This is especially important for anyone who has existing health problems or concerns.\nIn some ways, consuming more prebiotic food and/or using prebiotic products could be seen as being a more natural option than probiotic products. Instead of adding extra bacteria to the gut, they help the intestines to produce more of their own.\nHowever, it’s important not to lose sight of the fact that many foods, such as feta cheese and sauerkraut contains probiotic bacteria.\nPeople were eating probiotic food long before it became trendy to do so. Although eating too much high-fat cheese too often may not be a healthy thing to do, eating either option is not generally frowned upon. So there is nothing wrong with the idea of consuming probiotic bacteria.\nConsuming prebiotic food and supplements is one way to boost good bacteria levels in the gut. Probiotics is another. It’s also possible to consume the prebiotics and probiotics together and many people do so. Of course, it’s important to remember there is no substitute for a healthy, well-balanced diet.\nWhat are prebiotics?\nA prebiotic is any food or supplement that provides indigestible fiber that feeds the probiotic bacteria in the gut.\nAre prebiotics the same as probiotics?\nNo. “Probiotics” is an umbrella term for the various different types of beneficial bacteria present in the gut. “Prebiotics” refers to the natural fiber that feeds the bacteria and helps it to multiply.\nCan you take prebiotics and probiotics together?\nYes. In fact, there is a lot to be said for doing so. That’s why some supplements contain both. When you take probiotics you are increasing the amount of good bacteria present in your gut. By taking prebiotics at the same time you are providing the bacteria with the food it needs to multiply quickly, thereby enhancing the overall benefits.\nWhy do people take prebiotic supplements?\nPeople take prebiotic supplements to boost the activity of gut-friendly bacteria. Research suggests increasing probiotic bacteria may offer numerous health benefits. This “probiotic” bacteria thrives best when it has an ample supply of food. Prebiotic supplements provide the special type of fiber the bacteria feeds upon.\nIs it safe to take prebiotics during pregnancy?\nUnless you have a gut-related health problem, such as IBS, there is no reason why you should not add more prebiotic foods to your diet. However, it would be wise to consult a doctor before using any brand of prebiotic supplement. Some supplements may contain additional ingredients, such as colorants, that may make them a poor choice for use during pregnancy.\nAre there any reasons to take prebiotics during pregnancy?\nApart from nourishing the good bacteria in the gut, prebiotic foods are also rich in vitamins and minerals that can support the good health of mother and child. Prebiotic supplements may offer benefit too, but should not be used without a doctor’s approval.\nDue to the fact that they increase levels of good bacteria, prebiotics may offer additional benefits. Probiotic bacteria are also active in other areas of the body, including the vagina. Babies who are born via vaginal delivery gain exposure to this bacteria. This exposure may give the child’s immune system a head start.\nDoes breast milk contain prebiotics?\nYes. As well as providing prebiotics, breast milk is also a source of probiotic bacteria called Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs).\nHow do I prevent flatulence while using prebiotics?\nAny intestinal gas that builds up is likely to be due to the increase in probiotic bacteria. The best way to prevent flatulence from becoming a problem is to gradually increase extra fiber to the diet over a period of days. This gives the intestines the extra time they need to adapt.\nShould I use prebiotics after a colon cleanse?\nCleansing the colon purges the body of a lot of the bacteria prebiotics increase, so getting more prebiotics into your body is a very good idea. However, unless your doctor has recommended otherwise, a better idea is not to cleanse your colon at all.\nWhat is gut microbiota?\nGut microbiota is a term that encompasses all the bacteria and other microbes that live within the digestive tract. Some of the bacteria are good, others are bad. Prebiotics help increase the presence of the good kind.']	['<urn:uuid:4b62cb33-f81c-40c7-9301-cd69787a37a8>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	6	41	1834
21	What's the key difference between Calvin's and Rawls' approaches to establishing fair principles for society?	Calvin's approach emphasizes the concept of equity as central to social ethics and is grounded in Protestant religious tradition, while Rawls argues that fair principles must come from a hypothetical agreement made behind a 'veil of ignorance' where people don't know their personal qualities, strengths, or weaknesses.	"['Access your Project MUSE content using one of the login options below Close(X)\nBrowse Results For:\nThe Movement, International Law, and Opposition\nOver twenty years after the 1989 UN General Assembly vote to open the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) for signature and ratification by UN member states, the United States remains one of only two UN members not to have ratified it. The other is Somalia. Child Rights: The Movement, International Law, and Opposition explores the reasons for this resistance. It details the objections that have arisen to accepting this legally binding international instrument, which presupposes indivisible universal civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, and gives children special protection due to their vulnerability. The resistance ranges from isolationist attitudes toward international law and concerns over the fiscal impact of implementation, to the value attached to education in a faith tradition and fears about the academic deterioration of public education. The contributors to the book reveal the significant positive influence that the CRC has had, despite not being ratified, on subjects such as educational research, child psychology, development ethics, normative ethics, and anthropology. The book also explores the growing homeschooling trend, which is often evangelically led in the US, but which is at loggerheads with an equally growing social science-based movement of experts and ethicists pressing for greater autonomy and freedom of expression for children. Looking beyond the US, the book also addresses some of the practical obstacles that have emerged to implementing the CRC in both developed countries (for example, Canada and the United Kingdom) and in poorer nations. This book, polemical and yet balanced, helps the reader evaluate both positive and the negative implications of this influential piece of international legislation from a variety of ethical, legal, and social science perspectives.\nPersonal Integrity in a Pluralistic Society\nHow can we agree to disagree in today\'s pluralistic society, one in which individuals and groups are becoming increasingly polarized by fierce convictions that are often at odds with the ideas of others? Civil Disagreement: Personal Integrity in a Pluralistic Society shows how we can cope with diversity and be appropriately open toward opponents even while staying true to our convictions. This accessible and useful guide discusses how our conversations and arguments can respect differences and maintain personal integrity and civility even while taking stances on disputed issues. The author examines an array of illustrative cases, such as debates over slavery, gay marriage, compulsory education for the Amish, and others, providing helpful insights on how to take firm stands without denigrating opponents. The author proposes an approach called ""perspective pluralism"" that honors the integrity of various viewpoints while avoiding the implication that all reasonable views are equally acceptable or true.\nCivil Disagreement offers a concise yet comprehensive guide for students and scholars of philosophical or religious ethics, political or social philosophy, and political science, as well as general readers who are concerned about the polarization that often seems to paralyze national and international politics.\nIn this risk-taking book, a major feminist philosopher engages the work of the actor and director who has progressed from being the stereotypical man\'s manto pushing the boundaries of the very genres-the Western, the police thriller, the war or boxing movie-most associated with American masculinity. Cornell\'s highly appreciative encounter with the films directed by Clint Eastwood revolve around the questions What is it to be a good man?and What is it to be, not just an ethical person, but specifically an ethical man?Focusing on Eastwood as a director rather than as an actor or cultural icon, she studies Eastwood in relation to major philosophical and ethical themes that have been articulated in her own life\'s work.In her fresh and revealing readings of the films, Cornell takes up pressing issues of masculinity as it is caught up in the very definition of ideas of revenge, violence, moral repair, and justice. Eastwood grapples with this involvement of masculinity in and through many of the great symbols of American life, including cowboys, boxing, police dramas, and ultimately war-perhaps the single greatest symbol of what it means (or is supposed to mean) to be a man. Cornell discusses films from across Eastwood\'s career, from his directorial debut with Play Misty for Me to Million Dollar Baby.Cornell\'s book is not a traditional book of film criticism or a cinematographic biography. Rather, it is a work of social commentary and ethical philosophy. In a world in which we seem to be losing our grip on shared symbols, along with community itself, Eastwood\'s films work with the fragmented symbols that remain to us in order to engage masculinity with the most profound moral and ethical issues facing us today.\nPromise of Enrichment, Threat of Destruction\nWith this new interpretation, Deborah Achtenberg argues that metaphysics is central to ethics for Aristotle and that the ethics can be read on two levels—imprecisely, in terms of its own dialectically grounded and imprecise claims, or in terms of the metaphysical terms and concepts that give the ethics greater articulation and depth. She argues that concepts of value—the good and the beautiful—are central to ethics for Aristotle and that they can be understood in terms of telos where ‘telos’ can be construed to mean ‘enriching limitation’ and contrasted with harmful or destructive limitation. Achtenberg argues that the imprecision of ethics for Aristotle results not simply from the fact that ethics has to do with particulars, but more centrally from the fact that it has to do with the value of particulars. She presents new interpretations of a wide variety of passages in Aristotle’s metaphysical, physical, psychological, rhetorical, political, and ethical works in support of her argument and compares Aristotle’s views to those of Plato, Marcus Aurelius, the Hebrew Bible, Hobbes, Rousseau, Kant, Freud, and twentieth-century object relations theorists. Achtenberg also responds to interpretations of Aristotle’s ethics by McDowell, Nussbaum, Sherman, Salkever, Williams, Annas, Irwin, Roche, Gomez-Lobo, Burnyeat, and Anagnostopoulos.\nThe text draws on a wide range of Immanuel Kant\'s writings, including his texts on moral and political philosophy and his lectures on ethics, pedagogy, and anthropology. Though the book is grounded in an analysis of Kant\'s writing, it also puts forward the novel claim that Kant\'s theory is centrally concerned with the relationships we have in our day-to-day lives.\nCompassion is a word we use frequently but rarely precisely. One reason we lack a philosophically precise understanding of compassion is that moral philosophers today give it virtually no attention. Indeed, in the predominant ethical traditions of the West (deontology, consequentialism, virtue ethics), compassion tends to be either passed over without remark or explicitly dismissed as irrelevant. And yet in the predominant ethical traditions of Asia, compassion is centrally important: All else revolves around it. This is clearly the case in Buddhist ethics, and compassion plays a similarly indispensable role in Confucian and Daoist ethics.\nIn Compassion and Moral Guidance, Steve Bein seeks to explain why compassion plays such a substantial role in the moral philosophies of East Asia and an insignificant one in those of Europe and the West. The book opens with detailed surveys of compassion’s position in the philosophical works of both traditions. The surveys culminate in an analysis of the conceptions of self and why the differences between these conceptions serve either to celebrate or marginalize the importance of compassion.\nBein moves on to develop a model for the ethics of compassion, including a chapter on applied ethics seen from the perspective of the ethics of compassion. The result is a new approach to ethics, one that addresses the Rawlsian and Kantian concern for fairness, the utilitarian concern for satisfactory consequences, and the concern in care ethics for the proper treatment of marginalized groups. Bein argues that compassion’s capacity to address all of these makes it a primary tool for ethical decision-making.\nEver since Calvin wrote his Institutes of the Christian Religion, admonishing the reader that “it would not be difficult for him to determine what he ought especially to seek in Scriptures, and to what end he ought to relate its contents,” scholars have endeavoured to identify a doctrine or theme at the heart of his theology. In his landmark book The Concept of Equity in Calvin’s Ethics, Guenther Haas concludes that the concept of equity is the theme of central importance in Calvin’s social ethic, in a similar way that union with Christ lies at the heart of his theology.\nHaas provides, in Part One, a brief survey of the development of the concept of equity from Aristotle to the scholastics, and as it was used by Calvin’s contemporaries. Haas also examines the influences on Calvin’s thinking before and after his conversion to Protestantism, with special attention paid to those influences that employed the concept of equity.\nIn the heart of this study, Part Two, “Equity in Calvin’s Ethics,” Haas presents a thorough exposition and analysis of the extensive role the concept of equity plays in Calvin’s ethics, demonstrating that Calvin’s approach to ethics is not restricted to meditation of Scripture text.\nThis book will force a re-examination of approaches to Calvin studies that have not appreciated the historical context and background of Calvin’s thought. The Concept of Equity in Calvin’s Ethics establishes that the Protestant tradition in Christian ethics, founded by Calvin, has a distinctive and vital contribution to make to Christian ethics, as well as to the broader discussion of social ethics as they are practised today.\nPerspectives on the Ethics of K. E. Logstrup\nThe Danish philosopher K. E. Løgstrup is best known in the Anglo-American world for his original work in ethics, primarily in The Ethical Demand (original Danish edition, 1956). Løgstrup continued to write extensively on issues in ethics and phenomenology throughout his life, and extracts from some of his later writings are now also available in translation in Beyond the Ethical Demand. In Concern for the Other: The Ethics of K. E. Løgstrup, eleven scholars examine the structure, intention, and originality of Løgstrup\'s ethics as a whole. This collection of essays is a companion to Beyond the Ethical Demand, as well as to The Ethical Demand. The essays examine Løgstrup’s crucial concept of the “sovereign expressions of life”; his view of moral principles as a substitute for, or inferior form of, ethics; his relationships to other philosophers, including the twentieth-century British moral philosophers; and the role of his Lutheran background in his ethics. Løgstrup also firmly advanced the controversial thesis, examined by several essays in this volume, that the demand for “other-concern” central to his ethics does not depend on religious faith.\nThis book compares the role of a sense of justice in the ethical and political thought of Confucius and John Rawls. Erin Cline demonstrates that the Analects (the most influential record of Confucius\' thought) and Rawls\'s work intersect in an emphasis on the importance of developing a sense of justice. Despite deep and important differences between the two accounts, this intersection is a source of significant philosophical agreement.The study does not simply compare and contrast two views by examining their similarities and differences; it also offers a larger argument concerning the reasons why comparative work is worthwhile, the distinctive challenges comparative studies face, and how comparative work can accomplish distinctive and significant ends.Not only can a comparative study of the capacity for a sense of justice in Confucius and Rawls help us better understand each of their views, but it also can help us to see new ways in which to apply their insights, especially with respect to the contemporary relevance of their accounts.\nFrom Bonaventure to MacIntyre\nConscience, once a core concept for ethics, has mostly disappeared from modern moral theory. In this book Douglas Langston traces its intellectual history to account for its neglect while arguing for its still vital importance, if correctly understood. In medieval times, Langston shows in Part I, the notions of ""conscientia"" and ""synderesis"" from which our contemporary concept of conscience derives were closely connected to Greek ideas about the virtues and practical reason, although in Christianized form. As modified by Luther, Butler, and Kant, however, conscience later came to be regarded as a faculty like will and intellect, and when faculty psychology fell into disrepute, so did the role of conscience in moral philosophy. A view of mature conscience that sees it as relational, with cognitive, emotional, and conative dimensions, can survive the criticisms of conscience as faculty. In Part II, through discussions of Freud, Ryle, and other modern thinkers, Langston proceeds to reconstruct conscience as a viable philosophical concept. Finally, in Part III, this better grounded concept is connected with the modern revival of virtue ethics, and Langston shows how crucial conscience is to a theory of virtue because it is fundamental to the training of any morally good person.', 'What is justice? According to the philosopher John Rawls, principles of justice are the outcome of a special kind of agreement. They are the principles that we would all agree to if we were choosing rules for our society and no one had any unfair bargaining power.\nBut how can we ensure that no one has any unfair bargaining power? Rawls’s answer is that we have to limit our knowledge. So he imagines that we all find ourselves behind a “veil of ignorance.” Behind this veil, you do not know anything about yourself. You do not know your sex, your race, or the social class you belong to. You do not know how strong or weak you are, how stupid or intelligent, or whether you are disabled. You do not even know what your goals in life are, or whether you practice a religion.\nIn this situation of ignorance, it’s not possible for anyone to propose social rules designed to benefit himself or herself over other people. And so, Rawls thinks, whatever social rules we would agree to in this situation would be fair and just.\nIs this the right way to think about principles of justice?\nA Fair Contract\nRawls thinks that we can understand what justice is by considering the idea of a fair agreement. According to Rawls, an agreement is not necessarily fair even if it is voluntary. In order to be fair, an agreement must also be made against a background of equality. It is unfair if one of the contracting parties is able to take advantage of the other party because he is stronger, richer, better informed or simply more powerful.\nIs Rawls right about what counts as a fair agreement?\n- If an agreement was entered into voluntarily, is that enough to ensure that the terms agreed to are fair?\n- Suppose you have a leaky toilet, and a plumber tells you that it will cost $2000 to repair. You agree to this price, not knowing that the usual price for the same type of repair is $200. Is the contract between you and the plumber voluntary? Is the contract fair?\n- Suppose a man comes to your door and asks you to buy a newspaper subscription at a discounted price. You do not particularly like the newspaper he’s selling, but you have heard from your neighbors that the man will make a habit of stealing your mail out of spite if you refuse to buy a subscription. Reluctantly, you agree to buy a subscription, at a discounted price. Is the contract voluntary? Is it fair?\n- Imagine that you are shipwrecked at sea, floating in the open ocean with no hope of rescue. A pirate ship comes upon you and the captain offers to fish you out of the water—but only if you agree to be the ship’s cabin boy forever. The captain does not exert any other pressure. He simply makes his offer and says, politely, “Take or leave it.”\nIf you agree to the captain’s offer, are you morally bound to remain the ship’s cabin boy forever? Would it be morally wrong for you to try to escape from your bondage when the ship reaches the next port? Why or why not?\n- Imagine that you are poor and cannot find work due to an economic recession. One day a new employer comes to town and offers you a job in his factory for a wage of 50 cents per hour. The employer exerts no pressure. He simply makes his offer and says, politely, “Take it or leave it.” You accept the offer, not without gratitude, because you have no reasonable alternative. Is the contract between you and your new employer voluntary? Is the contract fair?\nJustice, Impartiality, and Ignorance\nAccording to Rawls, justice is the outcome of a fair contract. However, for Rawls a contract is guaranteed to be fair only if the contracting parties are not able to take advantage of each other. Rawls therefore proposes that the principles of justice are the outcome of a special, hypothetical contract, concluded between behind a “veil of ignorance,” where no one knows any of his personal qualities, strengths, or weaknesses.\nIs the right way to think about principles of justice?\n- Should we abstract from our personal qualities, strengths, and aspirations in choosing principles of justice to govern our society?\n- Do you agree that no one should be able to propose a rule that benefits white men, just because he’s a white man—or to propose a rule that benefits aristocrats, just because he’s an aristocrat?\n- Do you think that you should be able to make reference to your religious beliefs, or your life goals, when proposing rules for society? Is it even possible to make such an important decision without knowing who you are and what goals and beliefs you have?\n- You often have to think about what would be fair, and how to treat people justly. In thinking about justice in everyday life, do you try to make yourself color-blind, sex-blind, race-blind, intelligence-blind, and treat people with equal consideration? Or do you think that treating people fairly is compatible with showing greater concern for some people than for others? Does fairness require you to be blind to the differences between people?\n- Would your answer to the previous question be different if you were a public official? Is it fair for a teacher to privilege her favorite student? Is it fair for a police officer to treat people differently because of the color of their skin, or because of their religion? Is it fair to judge some people more leniently than other people just because you like them more, or because you know them better?\n- As a matter of justice, should laws always be blind to the differences between people?']"	['<urn:uuid:fa172da8-f7f7-407f-b6ae-d65942955104>', '<urn:uuid:b03f7257-dd4b-49ab-8229-1729f36f3acb>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	15	47	3100
22	What are the major challenges facing the tunneling industry in India, and how are they being addressed through technological solutions?	The major challenges in India's tunneling industry include inadequate attention during contracting, non-availability of skilled manpower, lack of well-defined safety standards, and addressing geological challenges. Unclear clauses between contractors and tunneling agencies often lead to disputes, resulting in rework, increased costs, and delays. To address these challenges, advanced instruments and machines are being employed, including 3D measurement, imaging, and realization technology. For example, laser scanners are now being used to capture geometric measurements with millimeter-level accuracy, helping detect tunnel defects and study ancillary facilities. These technologies are particularly useful for measuring depositions and changes in shapes of urban structures, as well as for interference simulation projects.	['RITE OF PASSAGE\nThe tunnelling industry is not new to India, with some of the best tunnels having been constructed during the pre-independence period using the traditional drill and blast technique, and still going strong. However, the fact remains that there was an abundance of time and workforce available at a low-cost during that period, making such masterpieces possible. This is not the case today. Tunnelling has evolved a great deal over this time, and today, with the latest technologies and Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs) available, the tunnel development process in India has received a shot in the arm.\nAccording to reports, more than 1,600 tunnels have been either completed or are under development since the past few years. Some examples of wonderful feats in this domain include the Chenani-Nashri tunnel – touted as India’s longest road tunnel – and under-water tunnels, which help to create a robust transport network. Amit Uplenchwar, CEO, HCC E&C, acknowledges that there are abundant prospects for more such projects, saying, “With India’s strategic infrastructure development plans on their way to implementation, there is great scope for tunnelling in India,\nespecially for developing urban infrastructure, underground rail and road networks, transportation in mountainous regions and so on.”\nThe Indian tunnelling industry is undergoing a tremendous transformation. While domestic players have always been active in delivering the requirements of Indian consumers, the fast expanding Indian market has now attracted global players to India. Another welcome change in the industry structure is around domestic players seeking tie ups and forging business alliances with global players to take advantage of the latest technologies and seeking partnerships for capital-intensive equipment supply. Given the requirement for tunnels in urban India to bring in metro rail\nnetworks and underground water supply systems through congested areas, there is a growing interest amongst project managers for new designs and techniques for tunneling.\nOn their part, OEMs and vendors have been responding to this need by bringing in new standards of design as well as introducing new classes of materials to improve the quality of tunneling in Indian conditions.\nTHE RIGHT TECHNIQUE\nOf course, determining the most suitable tunnelling technique largely depends upon geological studies and further geotechnical analysis. Such studies include important parameters like rock quality that needs to be excavated, stress test of the land (tectonics) and groundwater conditions. Apart from the age-old drill and blast technique of tunnelling, most use mechanised\ntechniques for hilly and difficult underground or underwater areas. In such cases, tunnel boring machines (TBMs) are the most commonly employed mechanised solution. Daljeet Singh, director (works), DMRC, explains the process adopted. He says, “Indian infrastructure companies undertake station construction, while tunnelling work is done by their foreigner JV agencies. Their scope of work is clearly defined in the JV agreement, based on a specific construction methodology, and keeping in view the available land for the construction of shafts for lowering or retrieval of TBMs, list of utilities, and geotechnical investigation report.” He cautions that, “Any change of methodology has a huge financial implication and the cash flow of an individual JV partner and contractor is bound to fail, and the project will be delayed. My advice to contractors is to finalise the construction methodology of a project after procuring a detailed geotechnical investigation, utilities, building conditions survey and available land.”\nIt is acknowledged that even though tunneling is only a part of any mega infrastructure project, it is one that could run into a delay because of unknown issues with regard to geological parameters. Therefore, to avoid any delays impacting overall schedules, utmost attention is required to be afforded to the tunneling segment. Dr VK Gahlot, urban transport engineer, public works department, Government of Rajasthan, suggests, “Tunneling being specialised work needs special attention during the whole process, thus resulting in early completion of projects. The progress of tunneling work depends on the geology of the earth strata. In fact, sometimes, despite smooth progress, work may be delayed by many weeks due to the hard rock that lies in the path of a boring machine.”\nSahadeva Singh, director, project and planning, MEGA Ltd, also emphasises on contractor alignment, when he states, “The tunneling requires detailed domain knowledge on geotechnical parameters of the ground to be mined, and the structural condition of physical assets that exist in the influence zone of tunneling. Other key inputs come from the experience of the contractor to effectively co-ordinate the data with the structural design team and tunnel manufacturers in order to finalize the selection & design of the TBM or other mining equipment and the tunnel lining design of precast segments/in situ lining.” In recent times, public authorities, and also private ones in a few cases, have taken up projects of replacing age-old water supply systems to cities and towns. In such cases, a technique of micro tunneling – also called the trenchless technique – has become popular for implementation, particularly in congested areas.\nTBMS RULE THE ROOST\nWith a boom in infrastructure projects in India, tunneling requirements are on the rise for projects involving railways, highways, metro networks, water supply networks as well as sewage systems in congested urban areas. Apart from the cost considerations, the speed of completion for these projects is the most critical business requirement for developers and project managers. In this context, TBMs provide the ideal choice to deliver on this key requisite. Considering the known advantages such as speed of project completion, controlled debris management and efficient traffic management in congested areas, TBMs are the most preferred technique in many of these projects.\nANY CHANGE OF METHODOLOGY HAS A HUGE FINANCIAL IMPLICATION AND THE CASH FLOW IS BOUND TO FAIL- DALJEET SINGH\nRecounting the challenges involved in tunnelling and how TBMs support in overcoming these, Uplenchwar of HCC points out, “Boring a tunnel through a densely populated city too poses different sets of challenges. A typical challenge in an urban area is tunneling without disturbing the traffic and structures above ground. In the case of the Delhi Metro Rail project, the tunnel alignment passed beneath thickly populated residential areas that included schools, temples, hospitals and old heritage structures. Prior to the tunneling work, a structural survey was carried out in a 30m influence zone on either side of the alignment. To check the impact of tunneling on the buildings above, various monitoring instruments such as inclinometers, magnetic extensometers, piezometers, rod extensometers, precise level markers, bi-reflex targets and crack meters, were installed at regular intervals. This ensured that ground movements adhered to the design limits during and after the tunneling work. Choosing the right TBMs & equipment and ensuring engineering precision hold the key to successful implementation of a project.”\nIn the context of Indian conditions, he goes on to add, “Tunnelling methods in India are evolving from non-mechanised to mechanised. Given the Indian soil conditions, drilling with TBMs is the most preferred way of tunnelling. Wherever a TBM cannot be implemented, tunnelling is mostly done by the New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM). Key equipment like computerized hydraulic drill rig, high-precision surveying equipment, robotic arm shotcrete machine, telehandler with rib catcher etc. are used in this technique.”\nCHALLENGES AND VENDOR SUPPORT\nMANY TUNNELLING CONTRACTORS RELY ON EXTERNAL EXPERTS TO GUIDE THEM DURING THE DESIGN AND EXECUTION PHASE- SAHADEVA SINGH\nYet, despite the latest techniques, equipment and systems supporting land surveys and geotechnical analyses, tunneling activities remain risky and with some inherent challenges. The major issues that adversely affect the growth of tunneling demand are inadequate attention given while contracting, non-availability of skilled manpower, and lack of well-defined safety standards, apart from understanding and addressing geological challenges. In addition, having unclear clauses between the contractor and tunnelling agencies often results in avoidable\ndisputes at a later date. Many of these result in rework, thus adding to costs and delays.\nAs Sahadeva Singh puts it, “Many tunneling contractors rely, to a large extent, on external experts to guide them during the design and execution phase, regarding the design, specifications, equipment’s specification and method of construction. The contractors are primarily liable for quality, safety, structural soundness and completeness of project as per contract. The liability of experts in the form of detailed design consultants and/or project management consultants remains limited, and that introduces risks for the client. In tunneling activities, paying attention to safety goes a long way, not just in getting the job done most efficiently, but also protecting the needs of future users of the tunnel. Unfortunately, there are no standard safety guidelines only for tunneling, which can cause delays and even loss of property and life. The assistance provided by advanced instruments and machines helps in addressing some of these issues.\nGahlot says, “Monitoring triggers and impact sensors are being installed by vendors, during the tunneling work, so that no damage is caused to the existing buildings and safety during boring is ensured.”\nGiven the long-term use of tunnels by many, ongoing maintenance of tunnels is an equally big challenge. There is a huge requirement to understand the degradation to tunnel structures after a gap of time. In such cases, one has to go through techniques like 3D measurement, imaging and realization technology. Faro, a global company with its presence in India, specialists in this arena. Faro has a laser scanner (Focus) to capture a comprehensive set of geometric measurement results. The images of tunnel walls generated are accurate to the millimetre level. In fact, accuracy is at levels better than 5mm, and users can directly extract geometric measurements from the images. Oftentimes, it is through these images that tunnel defects are detected, or ancillary facilities are studied. These scanners are also useful to take 3D measurements from a distance in cases where areas are dangerous or inaccessible.In such cases, the scanners help in projects that involve measurement of depositions and changes in shapes of urban structures; as well as interference simulation projects.\nMONITORING TRIGGERS AND IMPACT SENSORS ARE BEING INSTALLED, SO THAT NO DAMAGE IS CAUSED TO THE EXISTING BUILDINGS- DR VK GAHLOT\nThis data indicates to the team exactly how much reinforcement is required to maintain the tunnel’s structural stability, which is a major concern for a high-traffic passageway. To sum up, India would immensely benefit if tunneling technologies remain relevant to local conditions and are developed while keeping in consideration local knowledge of data. Given the number of infrastructure projects on the anvil, this is truly the need of the hour, if India is to benefit from employing advanced tunneling technologies to fast track these projects.']	['<urn:uuid:ee5f79e9-130d-4288-b81d-fe54faf83cdb>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	20	106	1750

Protective coloring camouflage makes the wearer blend with natural surroundings through patterns of green, brown, tan and black splotches. Dark bat fur provides nocturnal camouflage by helping conceal bats during their night foraging periods, as seen in little yellow-shouldered bats which use their dark coloring to avoid detection by predators while feeding at night.

This includes northern Argentina, eastern and southern Brazil, and the Lesser Antilles. (Gannon, et al., 1989; Mello, et al., 2008; Stoner, 2001; Vieira and Carvalho-Okano, 1994; Wilson and Reeder, 2005)\nLittle yellow-shouldered bats occupy many different types of forest habitats, including mountainous forests (Mello, Kalko, and Silva, 2008), semi-deciduous tropical rainforests, and humid and semi-arid forests. They are also found in tropical lowlands and open areas, such as fields or farmland. They are common near streams or other bodies of water. They are not found at elevations over 1,000 m (Gannon et al., 1989). Little yellow-shouldered bats commonly roost in tree cavities in lower canopy levels, especially in mature trees with diameters 50% larger than surrounding trees. They prefer to roost in the tree species: Pimenta dioica, Metopium brownei, Vitex gaumeri, and Pseudobombax ellipticum, most likely because the heartwood of these trees easily decays, resulting in hollows (Evelyn and Stiles, 2003). They also roost in manmade structures and caves (Gannon et al., 1989). (Evelyn and Stiles, 2003; Gannon, et al., 1989; Mello, et al., 2008)\nLittle yellow-shouldered bats are medium-sized bats with total lengths of 62 to 65 mm, forearm lengths of 36.6 to 45.0 mm, and average wingspan of 30 cm (Vieira and Carvalho-Okano, 1994). Males tend to have slightly larger total length and cranial measurements than females (Gannon et al., 1989). Typical mass is 13 to 18g (Evelyn and Stiles, 2003). They have short, broad ears with a tragus that is one-third the size of the ear. They also have distinct nose leaves. No tail is present and calcars are extremely small or absent. Coloring varies by gender, age, and geography. Dorsal fur can be dark gray to reddish-brown and the ventral fur is always lighter than the dorsal fur. The head, neck, and shoulder hairs have a yellow tint due to yellow hair shafts and with dark-brown tips. Males tend to have yellow to red stained shoulder hairs that look like straps on a soldier’s uniform due to an excretion from their shoulder glands. It is this coloring that gives (Evelyn and Stiles, 2003; Gannon, et al., 1989; Nowak, 1991; Vieira and Carvalho-Okano, 1994)the common name ""little yellow-shouldered bat."" The patagia is solid brown (Gannon et al., 1989).\nLittle yellow-shouldered bats are homoiothermic, with an average body temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius and a range from 34 to 38 degrees Celsius. They have been known to survive with a body temperature of 41 degrees Celsius (Gannon et al., 1989). (Gannon, et al., 1989)\nThe mating systems of phyllostomids do not tend to be promiscuous (Wilkinson and McCracken, 2006). Little yellow-shouldered bats tend to roost individually and the ratio of male testes size to body mass is relatively low, suggesting that sperm competition is not very high between males. Both of these factors decrease the likelihood of promiscuity in , but the possibility cannot be ruled out. More research on the mating systems of is needed. Reproduction of males corresponds with receptivity in females (Fleming, Hooper, and Wilson, 1972) and adult males secrete a strong scent from their shoulder glands attract a mate. This scent is what gives their fur the yellow coloration on their shoulders (Gannon et al., 1989). (Grzimek, 1990; Fleming, et al., 1972; Gannon, et al., 1989; Wilkinson and McCracken, 2006)have not been extensively studied. Other\nLittle yellow-shouldered bats exhibit seasonal, bimodal polyestry (Fleming, Hooper, and Wilson, 1972), reproducing twice a year, once in the dry season and once in the rainy season. There is also a pattern of bimodal peaks in pregnancy and lactation in females bats, but pregnancy has been recorded in every month of the year (Nowak, 1991). Reproductive activity peaks in three periods throughout the year, generally February to June, October, and December (Fleming, Hooper, and Wilson, 1972). The exact length of gestation is unknown, gestation length in other phyllostomids is from four to seven months (Grzimek, 1990). Females give birth to one pup, but births occur twice a year, once towards the end of the dry season and once in the middle-to-late rainy season (Stoner, 2001). Biologists debate whether this seasonal birthing pattern is triggered by food availability or temperature cues (Mello, Kalko, and Silva, 2008). Information birth mass is unavailablebut, phyllostomids have the largest young to maternal mass ratio of any other bat family, with young weighing up to 14% of adult weight at birth (Grzimek, 1990). This larger birth mass is most likely the result of a longer gestation period, allowing for faster post-natal growth of young. Young phyllostomids are born with well developed hind limbs, open eyes, and fur when born. It takes from 5 to 20 weeks to wean young (Kurta and Kunz, 1987). Young phyllostomids tend to become independent 1 month after birth. Juveniles reach sexual or reproductive maturity at 8 to 11 months of age (Fleming, Hooper, and Wilson, 1972). (Fleming, et al., 1972; Gannon, et al., 1989; Grzimek, 1990; Kurta and Kunz, 1987; Mello, et al., 2008; Nowak, 1991; Stoner, 2001)\nIt is unclear whether females use maternity colonies to raise young. Though the young are well developed when born, they must be nursed by their mother for several weeks after birth. Male parental investment has not been documented. Frugivorous bats are more likely than carnivorous or insectivorous bats to carry young while foraging, so it is possible that females carry their young when looking for food (Jones, 2000). (Jones, 2000)\nLittle yellow-shouldered bats live for approximately 20 years in the wild. (Grzimek, 1990)\nLittle yellow-shouldered bats often roost alone, but they can roost in groups as large as 10. It is unclear whether males and females roost together or separately (Evelyn and Stiles, 2003). Little yellow-shouldered bats are nocturnal and relatively inactive during daylight hours. At night they fly through the forest understory, canopy, and open areas. They can fly quickly in open areas but can also maneuver well in dense forests (Jennings et al., 2004). Individuals in high altitudes may migrate to warmer areas during colder months due to a lack of fat reserves and an inability to sustain long periods of torpor (Mello, Kalko, and Silva, 2008). (Evelyn and Stiles, 2003; Jennings, et al., 2004; Mello, et al., 2008)\nCompared to other South American bats, little yellow-shouldered bats tend to have relatively small ranges. Banding studies show that they roost and forage in the same area for several years at a time (Fleming, Hooper, and Wilson, 1972). (Fleming, et al., 1972)\nLittle yellow-shouldered bats use echolocation to navigate. Because they are frugivorous, their echolocation is not as specialized as bats that feed on insects. They use echolocation frequencies with low duty frequency and four harmonics. Low duty frequencies are excellent for short-range detection (Jennings et al., 2004). Little yellow-shouldered bats, like other bats, use vocalizations in frequencies audible to humans to communicate as well. The reduced horseshoe and spear structures on the noseleaf may suggest that these bats use olfaction to find food (Arita, 1990). Although nocturnal, little yellow-shouldered bats use visual information to evaluate their surroundings. Phyllostomids, including little yellow-shouldered bats, have larger visual centers in their brain compared to other bats, suggesting that vision plays a more significant role in their lives. Their night vision exceeds that of humans, which is a benefit when foraging. The yellow shoulder color of males also suggests that vision is important in sexual selection (Altringham and Fenton, 2006). The spicy smelling pheromones secreted from the shoulders of males are also important forms of chemical communication between potential mates (Gannon et al., 1989; Altringham and Fenton, 2006). (Altringham and Fenton, 2006; Arita, 1990; Gannon, et al., 1989; Jennings, et al., 2004)\nLittle yellow-shouldered bats are frugivorous. They prefer to eat fruits of plants in the Solanaceae family (nightshade family). When they are unavailable or low in abundance, these bats supplement their diet with fruits of the Piperaceae (pepper) and Cecropiaceae (nettles or cecropias) families (Mello, Kalko, and Silva, 2008). They occasionally drink nectar. Little yellow-shouldered bats begins foraging at dusk and tend to forage in the forest understory (Evelyn and Stiles, 2003). They search for food in shrubs and low trees but also forage at canopy level. They handle understory fruit quickly and canopy fruit slowly. Little yellow-shouldered bats can consume several fruits in a 5 to 15 minute time period. After eating, they pause to digest food, usually excreting within 20 minutes of consumption. They forage for up to 4 hours nightly (Bonaccorso, 1987). (Bonaccorso, 1987; Evelyn and Stiles, 2003; Mello, et al., 2008)\nKnown predators of (Evelyn and Stiles, 2003)include humans, snakes, opossums, raptors, monkeys, and spectral bats (Evelyn and Stiles, 2003). Many of these predators are avoided by night foraging. Their dark color helps conceal them during foraging periods and flight is an advantage in escaping non-volant predators.\nLittle yellow-shouldered bats are important in the dispersal of seeds of tropical plants, especially those of the Solanaceae family (Mello, Kalko, and Silva, 2008). They are the primary dispersers of seeds of Solanum riparium (Iudica and Bonaccorso, 1997). They are also important pollinators of Mabea fistulifera and other flowering plants (Vieira and Carvalho-Okano, 1994). Their seed dispersal and pollination roles make them important in the regeneration of forests. (Iudica and Bonaccorso, 1997; Mello, et al., 2008; Vieira and Carvalho-Okano, 1994)\nMany parasite species use little yellow-shouldered bats as hosts. Endoparasites, such as nematodes, and ectoparasites, such as mites, bat flies, and ticks are all found on this species (Gannon et al., 1989). (Gannon, et al., 1989)\nIn addition to helping regenerate economically valuable forest habitats, little yellow-shouldered bats and other frugivorous bats have positive impacts on farming and agriculture. They help in the pollination of crops and shade and support trees. Citrus, cocoa, coffee, allspice, mixed vegetation, and live fence vegetation have all been reported to benefit from these bats. Despite their appetite for fruit, farmers report that frugivorous bats such as (Estrada, et al., 1993)are not destructive to their main crops (Estrada, Coates-Estrada, and Meritt, 1993).\nLittle yellow-shouldered bats have few negative impacts on humans. The most notable would be their potential to carry disease and viruses such as rabies, but interactions with humans are rare. (Grzimek, 1990)\nLittle yellow-shouldered bats tolerate and adapt to deforestation well compared to other species. They are the most abundant bat species in disturbed forest areas. Deforestation is a concern, however, because of their preference for roosting in large diameter, mature trees that are often harvested first (Evelyn and Stiles, 2003). Neither the IUCN Red List, US Federal List, or CITES suggest (Evelyn and Stiles, 2003; ""IUCN Red List of Threatened Species"", 2009)is a species to be concerned about at this time.\nAlexandra Anderson (author), University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, Chris Yahnke (editor, instructor), University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, Tanya Dewey (editor), Animal Diversity Web.\nliving in the southern part of the New World.

24	depth of field factors what affects range focus distance aperture focal length compare	Multiple factors affect depth of field (the range where objects appear in focus). While lens aperture is commonly considered most important, focal length actually plays the most significant role - shorter focal lengths create larger depth of field while longer focal lengths make it smaller. The distance from lens to object also matters - greater distance creates larger depth of field, while close-up rings and macro lenses reduce it. Additionally, using a smaller aperture increases depth of field, especially when combined with bright illumination. The relationship between these factors determines how much of an image can be in focus simultaneously.	"[""Basics of lens selection\nBasics of Lens Selection and the Effects\nTypical procedure for image processing\nImage processing roughly consists of the following four steps.\n- Capturing an image\n- Release the shutter and capture an image\n- Transferring the image data\n- Transfer the image data from the camera to the controller\n- Enhancing the image data\n- Pre-process the image data to enhance the features\n- Measurement processing:\nmeasure flaws or dimensions on the image data\n- Measure and output the processed results as signals to the connected control device (PLC, etc.)\n- Measurement processing:\nImage processing flow chart\nMany vision sensor manufacturers focus on explaining Step 3, “Processing the image data”, and emphasize the processing capability of the controller in their catalogs. Step 1, “Capturing an image”, however, is the most important piece for accurate and stable image processing. The key to making Step 1 a success is proper selection of a lens and illumination system. This basic guide details how to successfully capture an image by selecting a suitable lens.\nCreating a highly focused imageApplication example: Detecting foreign objects/flaws inside of a cup\n- When detecting foreign objects/flaws inside of a cup, which of the following two images is more suitable for detecting small defects over the entire inspection area?\n- The image on the right\n- Because the cup is tall, it is difficult to get both the top and bottom in focus\n- Entirely focused image from the top to the bottom of the cup\nIt will be difficult to consistently detect the defects in the image on the left, even if a high-performance controller is used. With the right combination of knowledge, it will be easy to create a highly focused image like the image on the right.\nClear images are the most important part of image processing.\nThe following three points are essential for high-accuracy, stable inspection.\n- Capture a large image of the target\n- Focus the image\n- Ensure the image bright and clear\nLens basics and selection methods\nA camera lens consists of multiple lenses, an iris diaphragm (brightness) ring and a focus ring.\nThe iris diaphragm and focus should be adjusted by an operator looking at the camera's monitor screen to make sure the image is “bright and clear”.\n（Some lenses have fixed adjustment systems）\n※ There are various points that need to be considered when selecting a lens, such as field of view, focal distance, focus and distortion. This guide focuses on two points important for all applications, “Selecting a lens to match the field of view” and “Focusing an image with a large depth of field”.\nFocal distance and field of view of lenses\nFocal distance is one lens specification. Typical lenses for factory automation have focal distances of 8 mm 0.32”/ 16 mm 0.63”/ 25 mm 0.98”/ 50 mm 1.97”. From the necessary field of view of the target and the focal distance of the lens, the WD (working distance) can be determined.\nThe WD and view size are determined by the focal distance and the CCD size. When NOT using a close up ring, the following proportional expression can be applied.\nWorking distance : View angle = Focal distance : CCD size\nExample 1: When the focal distance is 16 mm 0.63” and the CCD size is 3.6 mm 0.14”, the WD should be 200 mm 7.87” to make the field of view 45 mm 1.77”.\nFocusing an image with a large depth of field (range in which a lens can focus on objects)\n- The shorter the focal distance, the larger the depth of field\n- The longer the distance from the lens to the object, the larger the depth of field\n→Close up rings and macro lenses make the depth of field smaller\n- The smaller the aperture, the larger the depth of field\n→A small aperture and bright illumination make focusing easy\nA camera is installed as shown in the illustration. A graduated tape that indicates the height is attached on a slope. In this situation, the pictures are taken to compare the apertures.\nContrast differences due to lens performance\nThe following images are captured with KEYENCE’s high-resolution CA-LH16 lens and standard CV-L16 lens. The difference in the image quality is caused by the lens materials and structures. Higher-contrast images can be produced by using a high-resolution lens.\n|Field of view||60 mm 2.36”/ Stain size: Approx. 0.3 mm 0.01”|\nComparison between a 240,000-pixel CCD and a 2 million-pixel CCD\nThe following images of the same target captured with KEYENCE’s 240,000-pixel and 2 million-pixel camera and magnified with a PC. Which image shows the characters more clearly? Of course, the 2 million-pixel camera. The difference in image quality directly affects the inspection accuracy when using image processing technology. Camera selection according to the application is also important.\nConventional image (240,000 pixels)，2,000,000 pixels\nWhat is distortion?\nDistortion is the ratio of change between the center and edge areas of a captured image. Due to the aberration of the lens, the distortion is more noticeable at the edges of a captured image. There are two types of distortion: barrel distortion and pincushion distortion. The general rule is that when the absolute value of the distortion value is small, the lens offers higher accuracy. Lenses with smaller distortion should be used for dimension measurement, for example. Lenses with a long focal distance generally have smaller distortion.\nSummary of lens selection and image processing basics\nHigh-quality images are fundamental for image processing. With some is basic knowledge of lens selection:\n- The suitable field of view for the target is ensured\n- The entire image can be focused\n- The contrast between the target and background can be enhanced with a suitable brightness\nThe next section will cover “illumination selection”. Along with the lens selection techniques discussed in this guide, illumination selection is an important factor for determining inspection accuracy when using image processing technology. The next guide will outline points for selecting an appropriate illumination."", ""Of the many complex aesthetic decisions that cinematographers make, lens choice is one of the simplest, most powerful, and most misunderstood.\nThere are several different factors that determine the aesthetic of any given lens, but today we're just going to be focusing on the basics. Focal length is one of the more straight-forward aspects of lens design. In the simplest sense, focal length is the physical distance between the imaging plane (ie. the sensor) and the optical center of the lens. Focal length values - which are expressed in millimeters - are basic measurements of how wide or zoomed-in a particular lens is. Easy enough, right? Where things start to get more complicated, however, is with all of the different aesthetic implications that the focal length of a lens has on the the final image.\nThe easiest to understand of these implications is field of view. When combined with a certain sensor size, the focal length of a lens is what determines field of view, or how much/how little of an image is actually being captured by the sensor. Here's an excellent and in-depth tutorial from Tuts+ on the topics of focal length and field of view that explains all of these concepts and explores how they're related.\nObviously field of view is a basic, albeit incredibly powerful tool for cinematographers, as it allows them the ability to directly manipulate the mise en scène of any given shot by including or excluding certain elements from the frame. Take a look at just how many aesthetic possibilities there are when focal length drastically changes and the camera stays in one position. Here we see everything from an extreme telephoto focal length of 580mm all the way down to an extreme wide of 8mm (from Vimeo user Pixine).\nOutside of determining field of view, however, the focal length of a lens can produce a wide range of aesthetic qualities that can have drastic effects on how an audience perceives an image. First and foremost is the issue of depth. Depth cues - or differences in light, shadow, and spatial relation that trick our brains into perceiving a three-dimensional space in a two-dimensional medium - are rendered differently by different focal lengths. Say you frame up a medium shot of your subject. With wider lenses, the depth cues in the scene become elongated and are seemingly pushed farther apart. In a sense, wider lenses artificially add depth to a scene. The wider the lens, the more dramatic this effect becomes.\nWhen you frame up the same medium shot with a telephoto lens, however, the exact opposite happens. The depth cues within the scene become compressed, which creates the illusion that everything in the scene is much closer together than it is in reality. Additionally, where wide lenses tend to add depth, telephoto lenses tend to flatten images and the individual elements in those images.\nFor one of the best (and most quirky) rundowns and examples of the aesthetic properties of different focal lengths, here's a wonderfully educational video from the University of North Carolina Wilmington and YouTube user HorrorOldSchool:\nLast, but certainly not least, is the issue of depth of field, something with which all of us are familiar. Depth of field is defined as the distance between the nearest and farthest points of an image where that image is in focus. Put into visual terms, wider depth of field results in images where everything, or most things, appear in focus. Shallow or narrow depth of field, on the other hand, results in images where only a small portion of the image is in focus, and where everything else falls out of focus to varying degrees.\nAlthough lens aperture is widely considered to be the most important factor when trying to achieve a narrow depth of field, the focal length of your lens actually plays the most significant role. Wider lenses inherently reduce depth of field, creating images where more elements are in focus at once, whereas telephoto lenses enable shallower depth of field. Of course, if you're hoping to achieve a certain depth of field, whether it be wide or narrow, there are several other technical factors to consider including the minimum and maximum apertures of the lens, the sensor or film size that you're shooting with, and the distance between your lens and your subject. The closer your subject is to the lens, the more out of focus their background will be. The closer the lens is to infinity focus, the wider the depth of field will appear to be.\nWhat are some of your favorite focal lengths to shoot with and why? How do you guys use different focal lengths to effectively tell a story?

25	I'm interested in trying to pickle vegetables in miso at home - what's the best way to do it and can I reuse the miso sauce?	To pickle in miso, put all ingredients in a resealable bag and press out as much air as possible. The miso pickling sauce can be reused a couple of times if there is no excess water within it. However, vegetables and tofu should be pickled separately from meat and fish to prevent cross-contamination.	"[""06.29.2021 (Tue.) - 09.30.2021 (Thu.)\nToday, fermentation is the hottest buzzword of the food and wellness worlds, but it has been an essential part of Japanese culture for millennia. This summer, JAPAN HOUSE Los Angeles presents a special focus on the diverse delights of fermented foods - as healthy as they are delicious. To kick off the program, we’re proud to present a special Master Class cooking series exploring fermentation, featuring the chef, cookbook author, restaurateur and Food Network star Giada de Laurentiis, and chef Shinji Ishida, of the Michelin-starred Tokyo restaurant Nogizaka Shin. In this two-part video series, Giada and Chef Ishida share classic fermented dishes as well as information on the ingredients that might surprise even those familiar with Japanese cuisine.\nEpisode 1 | Chirashi Sushi\nIn the first episode, Chef Ishida guides Giada in creating chirashi sushi, a dish where subtle flavors of vinegar, rice, and raw fish come together in various combinations.\nEpisode 2 | Pickled Vegetables and Miso Fish\nIn this second episode, Chef Ishida introduces Giada to preparing classic Japanese pickles, as well as a healthy and delicious way to marinate fish with fermented miso. First, Ishida lays out the basics of the pickling process, from the variety of vegetables that can be used, to the sweet vinegar (called amazu) used to ferment them. Amazu not only enhances flavor, but also longevity through fermentation’s sterilizing effects. While Chef Ishida includes a Japanese vegetable called myoga, he also demonstrates how pickles can be made from a variety of diverse local ingredients, such as cauliflower, tomato, and cucumber that are easily found in the U.S.\nSimilarly, the miso-marinade can be used on a wide variety of fish, from Chef Ishida’s kinmedai (golden eye snapper) to one of Giada’s favorites, wild caught salmon. Giada follows Chef Ishida’s process of preparing the marinade from miso, sake, and mirin, and making small cuts in the fish filet to allow absorption of the flavor and ensure the skin cooks evenly when fried. After each chef plates their colorful creations, they enjoy a first taste and discuss the digestive benefits of fermentation. In closing, the two chefs toast in celebration with a refreshing fermented fruit drink.\nThe fermentation Master Class series was filmed on location simultaneously at JAPAN HOUSE LA’s demonstration kitchen in Hollywood, and at Nogizaka Shin in Tokyo.\n*To watch the video in full screen, please click on the image above, then click on the YouTube icon on the lower right-hand corner.\nDiscover More about the Ingredients\nThere are about 4,000 varieties of vinegar in the world, and vinegar can be made by fermenting any kind of alcohol. Grain vinegars and fruit vinegars are two typical examples. Wine vinegars use grapes instead of rice, and can be made from wine, similar to how rice vinegar is made from sake.\nMiso is made from soybeans, rice or wheat, salt and kōji mold (aspergillus oryzae). There are various types of miso, such as rice miso, made primarily from soybeans and rice; wheat miso, made primarily from soybeans and wheat; and soybean miso, which is made using only soybeans.\nKoji mold, a living microorganism that helps break down other materials in the process of fermentation.

The miso-pickled ingredients will be nicely flavored and with excess moisture removed, the umami will increase. When pickling, put all ingredients in a resealable bag, and press out as much air as you can.\nThe pickling miso sauce can be used a couple of times if there is no excess water within the sauce. Vegetables and tofu should be pickled separately from meat and fish, to prevent cross-contamination.\nAbout the Chefs\nShinji Ishida | Chef & Owner, Nogizaka Shin\nChef Ishida opened Nogizaka Shin in June 2016 together with Yasuhide Tobita, who serves as head sommelier and general manager.

26	what did brezhnev doctrine give soviet union right to do	The Brezhnev Doctrine stated that Moscow had the right to intervene in any country where a communist government had been threatened.	['Soviet Invasion of Czechoslovakia, 1968\nOn August 20, 1968, the Soviet Union led Warsaw Pact troops in an invasion of Czechoslovakia to crack down on reformist trends in Prague. Although the Soviet Union’s action successfully halted the pace of reform in Czechoslovakia, it had unintended consequences for the unity of the communist bloc.\nBefore the Second World War, the nation of Czechoslovakia had been a strong democracy in Central Europe, but beginning in the mid 1930s it faced challenges from both the West and the East. In 1938, the leadership in Great Britain and France conceded the German right to takeover the Sudetenland in the Munich Agreement, but the Czech government condemned this German occupation of its western-most territory as a betrayal. In 1948, Czech attempts to join the U.S.-sponsored Marshall Plan to aid postwar rebuilding were thwarted by Soviet takeover and the installation of a new communist government in Prague. For the next twenty years, Czechoslovakia remained a stable state within the Soviet sphere of influence; unlike in Hungary or Poland, even the rise of de-Stalinization after 1953 did not lead to liberalization by the fundamentally conservative Czech government.\nIn the 1960s, however, changes in the leadership in Prague led to a series of reforms to soften or humanize the application of communist doctrines within Czech borders. The Czech economy had been slowing since the early 1960s, and cracks were emerging in the communist consensus as workers struggled against new challenges. The government responded with reforms designed to improve the economy. In early 1968, conservative leader Antonin Novotny was ousted as the head of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and he was replaced by Alexander Dubcek. The Dubcek government ended censorship in early 1968, and the acquisition of this freedom resulted in a public expression of broad-based support for reform and a public sphere in which government and party policies could be debated openly. In April, the Czech Government issued a formal plan for further reforms, although it tried to liberalize within the existing framework of the Marxist-Leninist State and did not propose a revolutionary overhaul of the political and economic systems. As conflicts emerged between those calling for further reforms and conservatives alarmed by how far the liberalization process had gone, Dubcek struggled to maintain control.\nSoviet leaders were concerned over these recent developments in Czechoslovakia. Recalling the 1956 uprising in Hungary, leaders in Moscow worried that if Czechoslovakia carried reforms too far, other satellite states in Eastern Europe might follow, leading to a widespread rebellion against Moscow’s leadership of the Eastern Bloc. There was also a danger that the Soviet Republics in the East, such as the Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia might make their own demands for more liberal policies. After much debate, the Communist Party leadership in Moscow decided to intervene to establish a more conservative and pro-Soviet government in Prague.\nThe Warsaw Pact invasion of August 20–21 caught Czechoslovakia and much of the Western world by surprise. In anticipation of the invasion, the Soviet Union had moved troops from the Soviet Union, along with limited numbers of troops from Hungary, Poland, East Germany and Bulgaria into place by announcing Warsaw Pact military exercises. When these forces did invade, they swiftly took control of Prague, other major cities, and communication and transportation links. Given the escalating U.S. involvement in the conflict in Vietnam as well as past U.S. pronouncements on non-intervention in the East Bloc, the Soviets guessed correctly that the United States would condemn the invasion but refrain from intervening. Although the Soviet crackdown on Czechoslovakia was swift and successful, small-scale resistance continued throughout early 1969 while the Soviets struggled to install a stable government. Finally, in April of 1969, the Soviets forced Dubcek from power in favor of a more conservative administrator. In the years that followed, the new leadership reestablished government censorship and controls preventing freedom of movement, but it also improved economic conditions, eliminating one of the sources for revolutionary fervor. Czechoslovakia once again became a cooperative member of the Warsaw Pact.\nThe Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia was significant in the sense that it delayed the splintering of Eastern European Communism and was concluded without provoking any direct intervention from the West. Repeated efforts in the UN Security Council to pass a resolution condemning the attacks met with opposition from the Soviet Union, and the effort finally died away. The invasion did, however, temporarily derail progress toward détente between the Soviet Union and the United States. The NATO allies valued the idea of a lessening of tensions, and as a result they were determined not to intervene. Still, the invasion forced U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson to cancel a summit meeting with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. Although Brezhnev knew this was the most likely outcome of the invasion, he considered maintaining Soviet control in the East Bloc a higher priority in the short-term than pursuing détente with the West. As it turned out, the progress on arms control agreements were only delayed by a few years in the aftermath of the Prague Spring.\nThere were also long-term consequences. After the invasion, the Soviet leadership justified the use of force in Prague under what would become known as the Brezhnev Doctrine, which stated that Moscow had the right to intervene in any country where a communist government had been threatened. This doctrine, established to justify Soviet action in Czechoslovakia, also became the primary justification for the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, and even before that it helped to finalize the Sino-Soviet split, as Beijing feared that the Soviet Union would use the doctrine as a justification to invade or interfere with Chinese communism. Because the United States interpreted the Brezhnev Doctrine and the history of Soviet interventions in Europe as defending established territory, not expanding Soviet power, the aftermath of the Czech crisis also lent support to voices in the U.S. Congress calling for a reduction in U.S. military forces in Europe.']	['<urn:uuid:d5c1a3a4-f040-4ccf-b8c1-9a27186ce6e6>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	10	21	991
27	Could you explain how family life was shown in early films about native communities and what message that sent?	Early films portrayed indigenous families in ways that aligned with Western family ideals. For instance, they would show scenes where families would pose for the camera in specific ways, with fathers depicted as hunters and mothers as nurturers, mirroring Western views of the nuclear family. These portrayals were similar to museum displays where sculpted models of family groups perform 'traditional activities'. Additionally, these films often presented indigenous people as ignorant of Western technology, which created voyeuristic pleasure and reinforced the contrast between what was viewed as 'primitive' and Western civilization.

Released in 1922 and filmed in the immediately preceding years, the film was a tentative experimentation in two genres – ethnography and documentary. At a time when the written word was the primary mode of information dissemination, Nanook of the North attempted to achieve what an ethnographic book on the Eskimo would have done. When motion picture as we know it today was taking its early steps as a medium of popular culture, Flaherty, who called it a non-fiction film, can be credited to have made the first documentary. Looking back at the ninety years since the release of Nanook of the North, one can see vast improvisations in film-making technique and technology. The addition of synchronized sound would be another cornerstone in the history of films. (Ellis & McLane, 2005) As can be expected in this early example/experimentation with narrative film, there are a few obvious problem areas. While nominally adapted to the documentary form, the viewer cannot avoid feeling the enactment of a pre-conceived script. It is as if the film-maker, instead of making himself the invisible observer of unfolding events, seems to have instructed Nanook and his clan to perform specific acts. This is typical of not only early documentaries but also the vast body of ethnographic publishing of the previous century. For example, other post-First World War forays in this genre such as Dziga Vertov\'s The Man with the Movie Camera, Walter Ruttmann\'s Berlin: Symphony of a City (1927) and John Grierson\'s Drifters (1929) all share this common flaw. This is also true of Flaherty\'s subsequent film Moana (1926). Flaherty portrays Eskimo and Samoan cultures in a revisionist mode by creating imagined characters, bringing back to life lost cultural practices (such as hunting for Walruses using harpoons) and setting the film in an ancient period (conveyed to the audience through use of oil lamps when electricity is easily available). All this goes to show that these early ethnographies were “done less in the name of art than to salvage elements of the past by portraying them in the filmic equivalent of \'the ethnographic present\'. As a result, Flaherty\'s alterations and temporal licenses met considerable disapproval in scholarly circles. He only inflamed passions further by stating, \'Sometimes you have to lie. One often has to distort a thing to catch its true spirit\'."" (Askew, 2006, p.29) There is also a directorial slant that seeks to iterate well-established stereotypes of the natives. This is not only applicable to Nanook and the Native American stock he comes from, but also to all indigenous people under European imperialist purview. For example, similar stereotyping of the natives is evident in British-authored ethnographies in Indian subcontinent, German experience in African colonies, Belgians in the Congo and the French occupation of Indo-China. What is also evident in early film ethnographies are the fixedness in perspective – these films were made by white men for other white men, with a patronizing attitude toward nativities/communities being explored. Further, the primitives were shown to display Western family ideals: “Like a museum display in which sculpted models of family groups perform ""traditional activities,"" Nanook\'s family adopts a variety of poses for the camera. These scenes of the picturesque always represent a particular view of family or community, usually with the father as hunter and the mother as nurturer, paralleling Western views of the nuclear family.

Most performance appraisals are usually carried out once or twice a year, and I do not think this exercise presents the actual situation at the ground.\nThe argument is that documentaries with an environmental theme have developed over the decades from ethnographic films (often structured by a simple quest narrative) into sociopolitical motivated films with a clear message for an audience.\nThe article seeks to provide a unique view of the Zapotec community with regards to the textile industry. The community is shown to be balancing a rapidly advancing future with an entrenched past deeply rooted in indigenous culture (Lynn 14). This paper is a review of this ethnography.\nTechnology has changed, and film makers make them in digital and video media. Their main aim involves study of a people’s culture and non-anthropologists also produce them. There have been a lot of disagreement on views on how to define them and their role in the anthropological discipline.\nNichols (1997) stated that documentary works to identify a ""filmmaking practice, a cinematic tradition, and mode of audience reception"" that is continually evolving and is without clear boundaries. According to Bruzzi (2000) a documentary is treated as a representational mode of filmmaking.\nHence, reflexivity must account for processes that are both methodological as well as autobiographical. Tim Asch and Napoleon Chagnon\'s The Ax Fight as well as Robert Flaherty\'s Nanook of the North, helps to analyze the ""reciprocity"" (Ruby, 121) that follows such presence and absence of reflexivity respectively.\nThe first stage of movie making is the preparation of a script. Usually a script writer prepares the script and sells it to the movie maker or producer. “The producer is the person who is responsible for coordinating aspects\nhe striking realities and practices of societies that can potentially supplant the dominating social theories with better understandings of human life and how it entails cultural changes.

28	modern day special occasions wearing traditional dress iceland japan compare	Both cultures maintain their traditional dress for special occasions. In Iceland, people wear the national costume (Þjóðbúningur) for weddings, ceremonies and festivities instead of regular formal wear, while in Japan, people wear kimono at tea ceremonies, first visits to shrines and temples of the New Year, and festivals. Young Japanese people particularly wear yukata at summer fireworks festivals.	"[""To most Icelanders, the Icelandic National Costume, Þjóðbúningurinn, holds great significance as it symbolizes Iceland´s independence and is therefore essential to the country´s identity.\nThe origins of the national garb are not quite clear as historical evidence before the 16th century is hardly found. But from the 16th and 17th century onwards paintings and manuscripts provide more information on Icelandic fashion. The sources from the 18th century are more extensive and include not only pictures and written accounts of the living conditions in Iceland and the way of life, but there are also actual fragments of clothing from that period bearing witness to the dress style of the ancestors of the modern day Icelanders.\nInterest in the traditional costume grew considerably in the 19th century when Iceland’s eagerness for independence from the Danish rule was on the rise. The Þjóðbúning turned out to be an effective tool for a nation with a growing sense of national identity and became a symbol for Iceland’s spirit. Since its early days, the national costume of Iceland has enjoyed various levels of popularity since the term was coined in the 19th century, during said fight for independence. In the beginning of 2001, the Icelandic Minister of Education and Culture established the Þjóðbúningaráð (“The National Costume Board”). Its role is to conserve and pass on knowledge of the traditional costumes and how they were made, as well as to provide advice about the costumes.\nThere are five different types of women's national costumes. Two of them, kyrtill and skautbúningur, were especially designed in the 18th century from scratch as ceremonial costumes, while the other types are traditional daily wear of Icelandic women in olden times.\nThe faldbúningur (“costume with hemline”) was worn since at least the 17th century and well into the 19th and had disappeared almost entirely by 1850. This costume type had a characteristic hat decorated with a curved sheet-like ornament protruding into the air; previously a large hat decorated with gold-wire bands was worn with it, as well as ruff. The faldbúningur was made of colourful materials and was beautifully decorated with gold embroideries and silver belts etc.\nThe peysuföt followed the faldbúningur but were simpler and less decorative than their predecessor. They are woollen, darker clothes and usually consist of a twill skirt and a jacket of fine knitted woollen yarn with a black tail cap made of velvet. It is believed that this outfit was designed when women were seeking simpler working clothes than the faldbúningur. Therefore they started incorporating certain articles of men’s clothing into their attire. This includes both the tail-cap and the peysa, which originally was a jacket with a single row of buttons, but evolved into this costume and eventually discarded with the buttons.\nIn the 20th century, peysuföt were still worn with some modifications. Upphlutur, some kind of tight shirt or bodice, had always been part of the original faldbúningur as an undergarment. The upphlutur evolved from undergarment into a costume of its own right. It is characteristic for its brightly coloured bodice and its tail cap.\nWhen the faldbúningur wasn’t used anymore, an Icelandic artist, Sigurður Guðmundsson, designed two new costumes, the before mentioned skautbúningur and the kyrtill. The skautbúningu is supposed to be a modernized variation of the conventional faldbúningur. The dress is worn with a white lacy shirt underneath and is mostly of a dark fabric. Lavish embroideries as well as buttons, belt and brooch made of gold complete the outfit along with a prominent, protruding hat.\nThe kyrtill (‘frock’ or ‘blouse’) was designed to look like Viking-age costumes. It however incorporates a distinctive looking hat similar to the one on the skautbúningur. While Sigurður’s vision of the Viking age costume remains popular, other costumes designed resemble archaeological finds of actual, traditional garbs closer, have gained some popularity as well.\nIn comparison to the women's Þjóðbúning, there is even less information about the historical background of the male national costume. Also, very few pieces of antique men’s garments have survived. One can find three very different versions of the male Þjóðbúning, whereas the typical þjóðbúningur karla is the only direct descendant of traditional daily wear of Icelandic men, while the other were designed from the start as ceremonial costumes.\nThe Þjóðbúningur karla (loosely translating to “guy's costume”) was mostly worn from the 17th until the 19th century. It was commonly made of navy blue, black or brown loden cloth and came with woollen breeches or trousers, a usually double buttoned vest and a double buttoned, short jacket called treyja. Sometimes a woollen peysa (“cardigan”) with a single row of buttons was used instead of vest and treyja. Just like their female counterparts, this costume was worn with a prominent tail cap, though historically different hats were also en vogue.\nIn the middle of the 19th century, when the traditional þjóðbúning had gotten out of fashion and many Icelandic men had taken to using continental clothing, Sigurður Guðmundsson also designed a costume which closely resembles 10th century Nordic clothing. This fornmannaklæði or litklæði (‘coloured clothes’) was quite popular for some time but eventually disappeared at the end of the 20th century. Although not really a traditional costume, the hátíðarbúningur (‘festive costume’) was conceived as a modernised version of the common national costume.\nAs for the children’s costumes, búningur barna, the costumes for boys and girls were, generally speaking, similar to the adult clothing but only slightly adapted in size and amount of decoration.\nTraditional shoe wear\nNowadays, Icelanders wear modern shoes when sporting the national costume or put on leather chaussures with buckles similar to the shoes commonly used with the Faroese and Norwegian national costumes in the 18th or 19th century. In the old days, however, shoes were made of either fish or sheep skin and known as roðskór (‘fish skin shoe’) and sauðskinsskór (‘sheep skin shoe’) respectively.\nIcelanders value and celebrate their national costumes on different occasions and in different manners. There are special tailors and associations dealing exclusively with everything revolving around the Þjóðbúning from the right fabrics to silver jewellery to the original looking tassels and so on. Every Icelandic Independence Day (June 17th) an Icelandic actress is chosen to play the role of the fjallkona (the lady of the mountain) who symbolizes Iceland as a whole. The fjallkona appears in full traditional garb, the splendid skautbúningur, complete with elaborate embroidery, belt of linked silver, silver brooch and a high white headdress.\nFurthermore, once a year National Costume Day is celebrated all over the country. Today, for special occasions such as weddings ceremonies or other festivities, some Icelanders choose to wear the national garb instead of a regular bridal dress or dinner jacket."", 'Walking in Kimono\nAre you interested in wearing kimono and walking around town in Japan? Th ere are many towns in Japan whose atmosphere is suitable for kimono. Strolling around traditional towns dressed in kimono will let you enjoy a special “Japanese” feeling!\nWhat is Kimono?1Kimono is one of the traditional costumes of Japan. Though today people usually wear Western clothes, not a few people wear kimono at tea ceremonies, first visits to shrines and temples of the New Year, festivals, and other traditional occasions. Recently more and more young people have been going to fi reworks festivals in summer wearing cotton kimono (yukata).\nWhat is Kimono?2Kimono is classifi ed depending on materials and patterns, and people wear an appropriate one considering the time, place, and occasion. Generally, lined kimono (awase) is worn from October to May, and unlined kimono (hitoe) is worn in June and September. In July and August, thin kimono (usumono) and yukata are worn. If you wear one with seasonal design, the design should be ahead of the actual season; if the kimono has a particular flower pattern, it’s best to wear it from a little earlier than when the flower blooms to just before it gets in full bloom.\nWhen you casually want to wear kimono and walk in town, using a rental service is recommended. To be dressed in kimono, tabi socks, an obi band, Japanese sandals (zori) and other items are additionally needed. As rental service shops usually provide all necessary things, you can visit one without anything. The number of shops providing services in foreign languages has been increasing, so you can get and wear a kimono without a lot of eff ort or anxiety. For those who are not used to wearing zori, putting an adhesive bandage between the first and second toes could alleviate any discomfort. You may have other concerns including how to use a toilet, etc. Ask about whatever concerns you to the shop’s staff !\nWalking in Kimono1Hida City (Gifu) Hida Furukawa is considered to be a good and peaceful place close to tourist-famous Takayama City. The town is dotted with white wall buildings and wooden merchant’s houses. About 1,000 koi fish swim in the Seto River. Kimono suits the quiet atmosphere of the town.\nKitsuki City (Oita) Kitsuki is a castle town often called “Little Kyoto.”Those who wear kimono can enter public tourist cultural facilities and can be given discounts at some restaurants and shops.\nWalking in Kimono2Kinosaki Onsen (Hyogo) Th e hot spring town has seven public baths (sotoyu) and also some foot baths. If you stay at a ryokan, youcan choose a yukata to your liking. The town is encourages walking around in yukata, and you can enjoy a walk even in the evening as well as daytime.\nKyoto City (Kyoto) Th ere are many rental service shops in Kyoto. If you wear kimono and show “Kyoto KIMONO Passport,” which you can get at Kyoto Tourist Information Center (Kyo Navi), major stations and other places in Kyoto, you can receive a variety ofspecial services.\nAsakusa (Tokyo) Nakamise, Senso-ji Temple, rickshaws …. Walking around Asakusa with its traditional atmosphere while wearing kimono will allow you to have a memorable experience of time travel.\nCruise on Tokyo Bay during summer !

29	south atlantic anomaly effect on satellites	The South Atlantic Anomaly affects satellites by exposing them to high-energy particles that can penetrate spacecraft skin and cause electronics upsets. Satellites passing through this region can experience short-circuits or communication issues with the ground.	['TORONTO — NASA researchers have been tracking a strange new development in an already strange phenomenon: the dent in Earth’s magnetic field appears to be splitting in half.\nYes, the Earth’s magnetic field has a weak spot, right over South America and the southern Atlantic Ocean, called the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA).\nCurrently, this anomaly does not impact us on the ground in any way. But when satellites pass through the anomaly, they have to account for extra radiation — and studying this so-called “dent” allows scientists to learn more about Earth’s magnetic fields and plan for future space missions and satellites.\nA visualization released on Monday of the changing magnetic fields between 2015 and 2025 shows the anomaly splitting off into two distinct regions in the next few years.\nIt also shows that the distortions in the magnetic field aren’t just occurring above the planet — they are happening deep inside of Earth as well, at the boundary between the mantle and the molten core.\nSO WHAT IS GOING ON?\nEarth’s magnetic fields are far more complex than they appear. Although they function somewhat like a bar magnet (a dipole), with North and South poles, the magnetic field itself can fluctuate and change, as it results from the constant churning of Earth’s liquid iron core, which generates electrical currents.\nAccording to the U.S. Space Weather Prediction Center, run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the region of space in a bubble around Earth where the “dominant magnetic field is the magnetic field of Earth, rather than the magnetic field of interplanetary space” is called the “magnetosphere.”\nThe magnetosphere is where solar winds interact with Earth’s magnetic fields. The pressure of these winds are what forces the magnetic field to curve around the dayside of Earth, and expand out into space in a tail from the nightside of the Earth, like water moving around a rock in a stream. Because the Earth is constantly turning, presenting a new side of the Earth towards the Sun, the magnetosphere is always changing shape.\nEnergy coming off of the Sun can sometimes interact with the magnetosphere in ways that create what is called “space weather events.” These events, such as geomagnetic storms, can threaten human technology and communications around the Earth, as well as astronauts in orbit. Satellites, GPS, electric power grids and even the flights of commercial airlines can all be disturbed by a stormy day in space.\nCharged particles that make it through the first layer of the magnetosphere can get trapped in something called the Van Allen Belts, which are belts of radiation around the Earth. These belts are far enough away from the Earth’s surface to prevent us from feeling the effects of this radiation, but where they interact with the SAA, more particles can get closer to Earth.\nIf Earth’s magnetic field is like a blanket around the planet, protecting us from charged particles from the Sun, the SAA is a place where the material has worn thin.\nAccording to NOAA, the SAA allows “cosmic rays and charged particles to reach lower into the atmosphere.” They note that the anomaly can change in intensity, and can affect satellites because it is full of “high energy particles that can penetrate the skin of the spacecraft and cause upsets in spacecraft electronics.”\nSatellites hit by high-energy protons can short-circuit or have issues communicating with the ground.\nThe International Space Station has also experienced issues when passing through the SAA.

For APS-C sensors (like Nikon DX DSLRs), multiply the focal length by 1.5 to get the 35mm format equivalent. Canon APS-C cameras have a 1.6 crop factor, Micro Four Thirds cameras have 2.0, and Nikon 1 series cameras have 2.7. This means a 35mm lens will give a field of view of 56mm on an APS-C camera and 70mm on a Micro Four Thirds camera. Full-frame cameras don't need this calculation as they show the actual focal length.	['We independently review everything we recommend. The information is provided by What Does The MM Mean On A Camera Lens? Full Information and while we endeavour to keep the information up to date and correct, we may earn a commission if you buy something through links on our post. Learn more\nUsing a high-quality wide-angle lens is one of the most significant aspects of property photography since it helps you to fit more into the frame and gives a better overall impression of each area. But, What Does The MM Mean On A Camera Lens? When you’re confronted with them all at once, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. They are, however, not as difficult as you may believe.\nWhat Does The MM Mean On A Camera Lens?\nThe standard unit of measurement for a lens’s focal length is millimeters, or “mm.” Thus, you can tell that a number on a lens relates to the focal length (a single number) or focal range when “mm” follows the number or numbers (pair of numbers).\nWhat Does Focal Length Mean When It Comes to Lens Size?\nThe human eye is supposed to perceive around the equivalent of 30-50 mm on a full-frame camera as a rough guide (more on that later). A number less than 30-50 mm will capture a larger view than you normally see, whilst higher numbers will focus on a narrower portion of your view.\nIf the Focal Length range has two numbers (for example, 24-80 mm), the lens is a zoom lens that can zoom and be utilized at any point within that range. A prime lens, on the other hand, has a single focal length number (for example, 50 mm), therefore taking in more or less of the view will require you to go closer or further away from your subject.\nBecause trade-offs must be made while making zoom lenses, primes have traditionally been thought to be optically superior to zooms. That isn’t to suggest that some zoom lenses aren’t superior to Prime Lenses.\nBecause of the crop factor, the same focal length lens gives different views on cameras with different sensor sizes, making interpreting focus length even more challenging (the sensor only takes up part of the projected image).\nAs a result, several manufacturers provide a 35 mm format equivalent on lenses built for smaller sensors, and the descriptions on this page are based on the 35 mm format. As a result, if your camera has a smaller sensor, which is likely, you’ll need to take it into account when choosing a lens.\nThere’s no need to calculate if you’re using a full-frame camera; a lens will give you the field of view you’d anticipate based on its number.\nIf your camera uses an APS-C sensor (Nikon DX DSLRs, Sony NEX, etc. ), it has a crop factor of 1.5, which means you multiply the focal length of your lens by 1.5 to achieve the equivalent focal length in 35 mm format. This figure is 1.6 for Canon APS-C cameras, 2.0 for Micro Four Thirds cameras, and 2.7 for Nikon 1 series cameras.\nThat implies a 35 MM Lens will give you a field of view of 56 mm on an APS-C camera like the Canon 70D and 70 mm on a Micro Four Thirds camera like the Olympus OM-D E-M1. On Nikon 1, would function similarly to a full-frame\nWhat Exactly Does 10-20MM Imply?\nThese are the most crucial figures to consider when purchasing a lens for real estate photography. The Focal Length of the lens is indicated by these values. While millimeters (mm) are used to describe the lens, they are not a measurement of any of the lens’ dimensions.\nThe figures represent an estimate of the optical distance between converging light rays and I’m going to stop here since it becomes a little technical and it doesn’t really important.\nSimply remember that the smaller the number, in this case, 10mm the more you can put inside the frame. We want a low number for property photography so we can get a lot of detail in the shot.\nYou can accommodate a lot of the room in the photo with the lens completely zoomed out at a 10mm focal length, which is ideal for showing off your lovely house like a pro.\nLet’s take a look at the other end of the spectrum to assist you to complete this image. Imagine yourself on vacation in the Serengeti, with a camera in hand, trying to capture the pride of lions from afar (obviously).\nYou’ll need a camera that can zoom in from a great distance. You’ll need a lens with a long focal length, like 600mm, for this. However, returning to the 10-20mm lens, 10mm is on the low end of the scale. To give you a sense of scale, a standard iPhone X shoots at a Focal Length Of 28MM (remember, a higher number so fits less of the room in the shot).\nWhat Does Mm Mean In Lenses?\nThe focal length of a lens is often expressed in millimeters (or “mm” for short). The “mm” after a number or set of numbers on a lens indicates the focal length (single number) or focal range (pair of numbers).\nIt’s all about determining What Does The MM Mean On A Camera Lens? In its own manner, each lens maker label lens has its unique set of qualities. At the very least, the maximum aperture (f-stop) and focal length should be labeled on the lens. Other aspects of the lens, such as the mount, may also be visible.\nWhen purchasing a new lens, pay close attention to each letter and number. Each one has useful information. A single letter (or absence thereof) can alter the worth of glasses by hundreds of dollars.\nFrequently Asked Question\nIs a lens with a higher mm rating better?\nFocal length is measured in millimeters, with a larger number indicating a greater zoom and a lower number indicating that the lens can be utilized for broader images.\nThe human eye is supposed to perceive around the equivalent of 30-50 mm on a full-frame camera as a rough guide (more on that later).\nWhat does it mean to have a 200mm lens?\nThe wider the lens, the lower the number. The focal length of telephoto lenses is very long. 200mm or 300mm, for example, the smaller number denotes the lens’s widest focal length, which in this case is 35mm. When you “zoom in” on a topic, the greater number, 105mm, shows the focal length.\nWhat does it mean to have a 12mm lens?\nOn a full-frame 35mm camera, a 12mm lens will offer you the equivalent field of view of a 24mm lens. Regardless, the criteria remain the same. The larger the field of view and focal length is, the smaller the number of millimeters. The smaller the number is, the narrower the range.\nWhy are lenses measured in millimeters (mm)?\nIt’s a metric for how well a lens system bends light. A lens that bends rays to a point at a shorter distance bends light more strongly than a lens that bends rays to a point at a long distance. “mm” stands for millimeters.\nWhat is the maximum range of a 600mm lens?\nAre you looking for the 600mm lens’s minimum focusing distance? If that’s the case, the answer is roughly 15 feet. If you mean how far away it can shoot distant objects that depend on their size and how large you want them to appear in the final image. It also depends on whether you’re shooting with an APS-C or Full-Frame camera.']	['<urn:uuid:17ba35f3-78a8-49f7-9104-6004ed6bf319>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	16	93	1272
31	How do rice hulls perform as insulation material and affect environmental health?	Rice hulls are excellent insulation material with remarkable properties. They contain 20% opaline silica combined with lignin, making them Class 1/Class A insulation. They have outstanding fire resistance with a fire spread index of 10 and smoke development index of 50, well below building code requirements. They're non-corrosive, fungal-resistant, and gain only 3.23% weight in moisture vapor tests. From an environmental health perspective, using rice hulls in construction helps reduce methane emissions typically released from rice paddies, which can cause eye and skin burns in farmers. Additionally, rice hull usage promotes better surface and groundwater quality by reducing the need for agrochemicals.

The walls are made\nof 12-inch trusses, and conventional trusses are used for the\nroof. It is vital that the floor joist be open-web in order to\navoid creating back pressure when the rice hulls are blown into\nthe floor cavities.\nThe spacejoist (with OSB on the bottom) creates a floor cavity\nof 12 inches. A rice hull structure cannot be built on a concrete\nslab, since in hot, humid climates concrete attracts condensation.\nThis means that the house would have to be equipped with costly\nThe wall trusses are built\nusing two 2x4s, with the outer edges 12 inches\napart, fastened by three gusset plates made of plywood located\nat the top, bottom and middle.

The exterior wall should\nbe constructed of 4x10-foot fiber-cement panels.\nOSB is not needed.\nThe panels are much easier to mount than lap siding. Since there\nis a gap of five inches between the two studs of the wall truss,\nyou do not need to drill holes in the studs in order to run electrical\nlines. The gap also breaks up the transfer of sound and heat,\nand the truss acts as a unit, allowing the wall to handle high\nYou can insert the rice hulls by hand or you can use a powerful\nblower.

Then the attic is\nfilled with 12-16"" of rice hulls. Ridge vents and soffits\ncause heat to dissipate, so even in the absence of air conditioning,\nthere is no condensation.\nRice hulls, unprocessed, are a Class 1 or Class A insulation\nmaterial. They emit no odor, so they pass the odor emission test\neasily. When tested for moisture vapor, they gain only 3.23% weight,\nso this test is easily passed as well. They are also non-corrosive,\ncreating no perforations or holes in copper, aluminum or steel.\nThey are highly resistant to fungal growth. On the ASTM E84 surface\nburning test, the results are nothing short of amazing. The building\ncode requires a fire spread index of 25 or lower, and a smoke\ndevelopment index of 450 or lower.

In a single 12 months, 23 p.c of deaths worldwide are the results of preventable environmental elements resembling publicity to hazardous substances in meals, soil, water and air. The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) advantages for environmental well being might be present in rice farming; nevertheless, different crops are relevant to the rules and methodology as nicely.\nSRI farming originated in Madagascar within the 1980s. Initially rejected, SRI is now a recommended various to conventional rice farming. The central SRI rules are as follows:\nHenri de Lalanie, a Jesuit priest, observed a 20 to 200 p.c enhance in crop yield whereas utilizing 50 p.c much less water. He achieved this by lowering the variety of seeds planted and utilizing fertilizer composed of natural matter. As an alternative of flooding the rice crops, he alternated between conserving them moist and dry. Farmers in Africa, Cambodia, India, Nepal, the Philippines and Vietnam additionally reported massive will increase of their yield.\nThe advantages of SRI have been proven in a number of international locations. These international locations have seen a rise of 20 to100 p.c rice manufacturing, as much as 90 p.c much less required seed discount and as much as 50 p.c much less water utilization. Having been described as a “scale-neutral” course of, SRI holds the potential to capitalize on the fundamental organic processes various by crop.\nDifferent techniques are System for Wheat Intensification (SWI) in India, Mali and Ethiopia; Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative (SSI) in India; System of Ragi Intensification in India and System of Teff Intensification (STI) in Ethiopia. Generally, the fundamental rules of SRI might be utilized to any crop, which might be then referred to as System of Crop Intensification (SCI).\nRelating SRI to Environmental Well being\nContemplating agriculture is among the greatest world industries, the potential for a optimistic affect by partly implementing good, eco-driven strategies may very well be game-changing. Sustainable administration of agriculture can contribute to “protect and restore vital habitats, assist defend watersheds and enhance soil well being and water high quality.” SRI will increase sustainable farming.\nEach day, there’s fixed interplay between people and the surroundings. Consequently, these interactions finally affect an individual’s high quality of life and well being. SRI advantages environmental well being by enhancements made on the standard of floor and groundwater, a significant component of public well being for customers and farmers. By bettering soil situations, SRI hits one of many many themes of environmental well being. SRI partially achieves this by lowering utilizing agrochemicals.\nLowering methane emissions also can assist obtain higher air high quality. Classically, rice paddles launch methane into the air, finally contributing to poor air high quality. Sensible eco-agriculture strategies like SRI stop these emissions from getting into the air. Farmers are at an elevated threat of methane publicity, particularly rice farmers. A couple of damaging but gentle results of methane on human well being are eye and pores and skin burns. Farmers, particularly, expertise the detrimental results of methane from animal waste and digestion. Extra particularly, rice farmers expertise damaging results due to the methane launched from rice paddies.\nSRI Potential in Environmental Well being\nThe advantages of SRI on environmental well being current a viable potential for fixing day by day and world environmental well being points due to the potential for a optimistic world affect. Rice farmers profit from the lower in methane emissions. They, in addition to different farmers, immediately profit from enhancements in soil high quality and fewer water utilization. Essentially the most promising side of SRI is that growers can mould the system to function with completely different crops and farmers, resulting in a more healthy surroundings for farmers and customers.\n– Karina Bhakta']"	['<urn:uuid:931829c8-6bb0-42fb-ae4a-fdb9b3a879e6>', '<urn:uuid:b092166c-0a53-4d2c-baf4-e92e8ead306f>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	12	102	1216
32	seafloor trawling damage recovery time effects	Trawling causes severe damage to seafloor habitats, with recovery times varying by depth. In shallow waters, recovery may be relatively quick, but in deep-sea environments (below 500 meters), recovery could take years or decades. This longer recovery time is due to deep-sea fauna having longer life spans than their shallow-water counterparts, combined with the fact that trawling severely reduces benthic organisms by up to 80% and decreases biodiversity by 50%.

Many aspects of typography translate only awkwardly to HTML.\nPlease use the page image\nas the authoritative form to ensure accuracy.\nEffects of Trawling and Dredging on Seafloor Habitat\nlimitation. Eutrophication also enhances the proliferation of faster growing phytoplankton, epiphytic algae, and macroalgae that compete with seagrass for light and space (Kemp et al., 1983; Phillips et al., 1978; Short et al., 1995; Twilley et al., 1985). Light limitation of seagrasses leads to diminished growth and stature, increased shoot mortality and declines in shoot density (Duarte, 1995; Moore et al., 1996; Short et al., 1995), resulting in declines in seagrass habitat area. Initial habitat fragmentation by trawling and dredging can make seagrass habitats more susceptible to the negative effects of eutrophication.\nThe maintenance of the ecosystem in an alternative state will depend on interactions with adjacent ecosystems and the intensity of the new biologic links. Additional disturbance generated by natural events or by new trawling and dredging can help maintain the assemblage in this state of equilibrium or transfer it to a new state. In the benthos, disturbances can be physical (hurricanes, suspension of sediment by surf, lateral transport by bottom currents, seasonal hypoxia generated by the input of nutrients, limited export of biogenic carbon) or biological (predation, flux and export of biogenic carbon, deposition of debris, bioturbation, competitive exclusion). Their common action is to remove organisms and to open spaces for colonization by other organisms. If disturbances are frequent, gaps will constantly reset to one of the multiple stable stages. If disturbances are rare, most of the community will remain in a stable state for most of the time. The loss of complexity and biodiversity can threaten important ecologic functions (the cycling of important elements or the control of populations of particular species) or the resilience of ecosystems to change or disturbance.\nFor the most part, existing information about the direct responses of benthic communities to trawling and dredging is consistent with the general principles that govern how ecologists expect communities and ecosystems to respond to acute and chronic physical disturbance. Trawling and dredging change the physical habitat and biologic structure of ecosystems and therefore can have potentially wide-ranging consequences. Mobile gear reduces benthic habitat complexity by removing or damaging the actual physical structure of the seafloor, and it causes changes in species composition. The reduction of physical structure in repeatedly trawled areas results in lower overall biodiversity. Of direct concern to commercial and recreational fisheries is the possibility that losses of benthic structural complexity and shifts in community composition will compromise the survival of economically important demersal fishes. Mobile gear also can change surficial sediments and sediment organic matter, thereby affecting the availability of organic matter for microbial food webs.\nIt is clear that the links between habitat alteration and loss of fisheries production can be subtle and diverse and that they operate on many spatial scales, from site-specific to regional. Most studies have been done in shallow water in small areas. Researchers have examined acute disturbances, rather than chronic, and they have studied short-term response focused in animal communities, as opposed to ecosystem processes such as nutrient regeneration. Although there have been many acute studies, few have examined the effects of short-term multiple passes, and future research should address this type of disturbance.\nPerhaps the biggest research gap is on chronic effects and recovery dynamics. More studies on chronic disturbance by fishing gear are needed to determine the dose–response relationship as a function of gear, return time, and habitat type. Research also should address recovery dynamics, with consideration given to estimating the large-scale effects at current fishing intensities (e.g., Collie et al., 1997). This research should include quantitative studies undertaken in deeper water (>100 m) and studies in stable and structurally complex habitats, for which the recovery trajectory will be measured in years to decades. The statistical power to detect fishing effects will be greatest when biologic sampling can be combined with high-resolution spatial data on fishing effort.', 'May 28, 2014\nTrawling dates back to the 1300s, and it became widespread in coastal areas around the world after the industrialization of commercial fishing in the late-1800s. Bottom trawling targets commercially valuable species that live near the sea floor, such as cod, rockfish, and various kinds of squid and shrimp. Gear varies depending on the fishing outfit, but nets can be nearly as large as a city block and scoop thousands of fish and other marine animals in a single drag.\nIn bottom trawling, a large net is dragged by a boat along the seafloor.\nBottom trawling has one of the highest bycatch rates of all commercial fishing practices. In the North Pacific, the practice accounts for 18 percent of annual groundfish harvests, and 82 percent of the region’s discarded by-catch. At times, bycatch accounts for upwards of 90 percent of a net’s total catch.\nIn addition to directly killing many fish and other marine species, studies have shown that bottom trawling is very destructive to the seabed. It dislodges sediment, which destroys the habitat of ground-dwelling organisms, makes the water more opaque and unsuitable for many species, and releases pollutants and carbon that had been trapped below the seafloor.\nAs populations of many fish species dwindle due to intensive commercial fishing effort, bottom trawling outfits are searching for new fishing grounds in ever-deeper regions of oceans around the world. However, this new study indicates that deeper ocean bottoms are also being affected by trawling, as the nets destroy delicate seafloor ecosystems at a level akin to desertification.\nA trawling net with its catch before it is dumped out on deck.\n“Thus, ultimately, intensive and chronic bottom trawling is deemed to transform large portions of the deep continental slop into faunal deserts and highly degraded seascapes.”\nBenthic, or ocean-bottom, ecosystems in the deep sea may need an even longer time to recover than near-shore environments, and may be impacted in ways that echo beyond the confines of their depths – and beyond the oceans, themselves.\n“Although we have investigated only one site in a certain time of the year, our results highlight the dramatic impact of trawling below 500-meter (1,600-foot) depths: we do not have information on the time of recovery in our study area because it is trawled all the year round on weekdays, two times per day since about 30 years!” Antonio Pusceddu, of Italy’s Marche Polytechnic University and lead author of the study, told mongabay.com.\n“Nevertheless, since deep-sea fauna have longer life spans than the shallower counterparts, we can reliably hypothesize that the time needed to recover after an eventual cessation of trawling activities could be sensibly longer (maybe years or decades) than the time needed for shallow benthic communities,” Pusceddu said. “So, the major difference in the time of recovery from trawling impact is clearly linked with the depth at which trawling is carried out.”\nThe researchers compared sediment samples from trawled and non-trawled areas off the coast of Spain, and found that bottom trawling severely reduced the overall amount of very small animals living in deep-sea sediments. Particularly affected were nematodes, tiny worms that make up the dominant group in these environments, and which are very important for ecosystem processes.\nNematodes are tiny worms that form a vital component of many aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Some species are parasites of other animals. Photo by William Wergin and Richard Sayre. Colorized by Stephen Ausmus.\nOverall, the researchers found that sediment from chronically trawled areas had 80 percent fewer tiny benthic organisms, called “meiofauna,” and 50 percent less biodiversity than areas that were not trawled. They also found trawling was linked to a 52 percent reduction in organic matter, and a 37 percent reduction in organic carbon consumption.\nCarbon consumption by deep-sea meiofauna is an important part of the carbon cycle, by which carbon is exchanged between the land, sea, and air. The researchers believe that the ubiquity of bottom trawling along the world’s coasts may be affecting carbon cycling in significant ways.\n“Deep-sea trawling is currently carried out along large sectors of the oceans,” write the authors, “and it appears to have severe consequences on deep-sea sediment dynamics at a global scale.”\nThese consequences may be echoed up marine food chains, as many organisms are ultimately dependent on meiofauna for energy and nutrients. In addition, some meiofauna are actually the larvae of bigger, or macrofaunal, species. Damage to deep-sea beds by trawling may mean both depletion of an important food source and destruction of nurseries for many species.\nOcean sediments are an important player in the global carbon cycle.\nTrawling not only destroys meiofauna outright, but also disrupts the layer of carbon-rich material that is their primary energy source. This material then hangs suspended in the water where it either takes a long time to re-descend, or is moved by ocean currents to even deeper parts of the ocean and away from the organisms that depend on it.\n“In our study we hypothesize that what happens at 500-meter depths probably influences the communities at 2,000-meter (6,500-foot) depth: sediments re-suspended at 500-meter depths can reach the deepest part of the canyon,” Pusceddu said.\nSeveral nations have imposed restrictions on bottom trawling. For instance, the U.S. banned bottom trawling off most of its Pacific coast in 2006, and Palau has both banned it throughout its jurisdiction as well as prohibited any Palauan citizen or corporation from participating elsewhere in the world. A few multinational fisheries commissions have also imposed regulations on bottom trawling in two of the most affected regions – the mid-Atlantic Ridge and the South Pacific. However, a bid by Palau to ban unregulated bottom trawling beyond the national level was blocked during United Nations negotiations by Iceland and other opposing countries.\n- Pusceddu, A., Bianchelli, S., Martín, J., Puig, P., Palanques, A., Masqué, P., & Danovaro, R.

33	How do the educational requirements compare between studying social work in urban areas and illustration - do both involve working with other disciplines?	Both fields emphasize transdisciplinary approaches. The Social Work in Urban Areas (SWUA) program requires social workers to work alongside urban planners, healthcare practitioners, and business developers. Similarly, the Illustration curriculum involves interaction with multiple disciplines, combining drawing, painting, design, and digital experiences, while preparing students to work across connected disciplines including animation, graphic design, and computer game development.	['“A fresh future is taking shape, with urban areas around the world becoming not just the dominant form of habitat for humankind, but also the engine-rooms of human development as a whole” (UN Habitat 2012)\nAs more than 50% of us live in urban areas—a number that will increase up to as many as 75% by 2050—urbanization has far-reaching consequences for the majority of the European population. As professionals, social workers deal with social problems, and, most often, these problems unfold in urban spaces. As social spaces, urban areas are both interesting and important, because they echo local and global social relations, developments, problems, and solutions.\nHistorically, disciplines such as social work and urban sociology have been closely associated. However, during the last decades, casework has become a dominant social work paradigm in many European countries. As a response to this development, four Erasmus partners (University College Metropol, Copenhagen; Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, Amsterdam; Artevelde University College, Ghent; and Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, Helsinki) in 2015 began to develop a 30 ECTS joint study program called Social Work in Urban Areas (SWUA). The objective of our partnership is to contribute to the creation of a new paradigm for urban social work practice through education. In the future, we will need social workers (and other welfare professionals) who are competent in co-creating a sustainable and socially just life in cities. Developing such competences calls for a more transdisciplinary approach to social work education: future practitioners of social work in urban areas need to be able to work alongside urban planners, healthcare practitioners, business developers, sociologists etc. The SWUA program supports the education of social workers who are, on the one hand, competent to think critically about the role of social work in the context of ‘the urban age’ (Williams 2016), and, on the other hand, actively participating in the development of innovative and sustainable community interventions.\nIn the Fall/Winter semester of 2017, the University College Metropol, Copenhagen, successfully hosted the program for the first time bringing together students and teachers from eight different European countries, learning in an international/European context about global issues.\nThe overall objectives of our strategic partnership are to develop a program to train educators and partners for work in urban areas and to create an online learning platform to support the distribution of the knowledge, experience, and expertise that are the outcomes of this transnational study program and strategic partnership.\nFor more information, please contact\ntel. +358 40 641 8195\nMuuta maailmaa kanssamme\nTule mukaan muutosta vauhdittavaan varainhankintakampanjaamme.

Some courses are geared to developing foundational skills and others more focused toward professional application. This curriculum offers its majors a wide selection of unique options to explore related to their field and interest of study. Pedagogical emphasis is on discovering and developing the artist within the illustrator and his/her unique point of view. When artists find their unique expression, they can take advantage of all the outlets available to their work. The program prepares individual students for a life in the arts and the flexibility to enter diverse professional areas within it.\nIllustration is a unique art form that is defined not by its medium, but by its context. Illustration finds its home in the public sphere of popular media. With a rich history and a modern, contemporary outlook, illustration brings life to concepts and stories through image making. Whether created digitally or by hand, an illustration can be both a masterful work of art and a practical business application. Illustrators marry their ability to create visually striking images with their ability to solve problems in unique and engaging ways. Illustrators create images for a variety of outlets that include children’s books, advertising campaigns, clothing, packaging and store displays, video games, movies, animations, and comic books. Illustrators are art directors, graphic, package and product designers, computer game developers, character designers, digital artists, animators, exhibit designers, and storyboard, concept and studio artists.\nStudents graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Illustration will:\n- Demonstrate knowledge of figure study and picture making, along with traditional and digital technical skill development, leading to successful image making as it relates to the multi-faceted and ever-changing illustration industry;\n- Discover and develop point of view (critical thinking, self-discovery, and effectively combing content and technique in a unique expression). This includes acquiring critical drawing and thinking skills and developing intellectual curiosity leading to successful problem solving and meaningful visual communication;\n- Understanding the unique aesthetic of the illustrator as designer and the development of knowledge and skills leading to successful design outcomes;\n- Discover the languages, concepts, and practices of contemporary illustration across connected disciplines and have options to further explore those areas in depth;\n- Acquire and demonstrate knowledge of the history of illustration;\n- Demonstrate habits of mind (studio process, research, personal discipline, time management, professional culture of the program) as well as the ability to critique, articulate their work, and present ideas;\n- Acquire and demonstrate knowledge and skills of professional development (presentation, audience awareness, marketing, promotion, business, Web design, entrepreneurship). Preparing for a life in the arts and the flexibility to enter diverse professional areas within it.\nAcademic plans provide a semester by semester suggested course sequence. Plans can be customized through discussions with academic advisors.\nProgram Requirements (126 credits)\nCAMD College Core (18 credits)\nComplete two of the following groups:\nCAMD School Core (6 credits)\nAll CAMD students are required to complete 6 credits of School Core coursework after completing Core Studies.

34	kinetic sculptures movement types power sources	Kinetic sculptures utilize various power sources and movement types. Some are powered by natural elements like wind (such as Anthony Howe's 'Chief' and 'About Face' sculptures) or water. Others use electrical mechanisms, like the SENSE #1 installation with its 288 programmable RGB LEDs. Some pieces are manually operated, like Joyce Lin's bird motion study that uses a hand crank, while others employ complex mechanical systems with gears and rods, such as Ken Toonz's Orrery which recreates planetary motions. These sculptures can create various movements including rotation, wave-like motions, flapping, and complex intersecting patterns.	"['You have seen beautiful and elegant paintings on walls; lots of them, I am certain. You’ve also seen paper sculptures (or wood or even fruit) made by master artisans. But have you seen moving artworks or sculptures?\nThey are called Kinetic Sculptures, and they are what you expect them to be: they are artworks and sculptures that actually move. These moving sculptures aren’t that common, especially since it takes a lot of time to plan and build them. But one thing is for sure, they create hypnotic, spell-binding illusions that will make it very, very hard for you to look away.\nThe ones shown below are GIFs specially created to illustrate certain parts of the videos they were taken from. For the full video, follow the links provided.\nThis is a hypnotic kinetic artwork by Jennifer Townley. The double helix sculpture makes repetitive twists, which merge into a complex pattern, while they rotate in their own axis.\n2. BMW Museum Kinetic Scuplture\nThis kinetic sculpture by BMW leveraged 714 metal balls hung from the ceiling with thin wires. The outcome is a kinetic sculpture that is in the outline of their cars.\nA kinetic sculpture by Geoffrey Drake-Brockman that uses 256 moving rods, this is Headspace. The sculpture is displayed at a grammar school in Perth, Australia. The rods move independently of each other.\nA kinetic sculpture depicting a huge human head by David Černý that can be seen in Charlotte, North Carolina. The 14 ton stainless steel kinetic sculpture also serves as a fountain in the Arco Corporate Drive business park.\nA kinetic sculpture by David C. Roy that uses wood and two mechanisms that make the entire sculpture dance in a seemingly random order. The kinetic sculpture was created in 1993 as part of a limited edition kinetic sculpture by David Roy. You can find more at his site, Wood That Works.\n6. On Eagle’s Wings\nA kinetic art sculpture by Nick Diemel On Eagle’s Wings is a moving wall art. It is made of wood plus some machinations that help make it move. The name of the piece is inspired by how the sculpture resembles an eagle in mid-flight over the horizon.\n7. Tele Present Water\nAn elegant moving sculpture by David Bowen that uses steel rods and strings to recreate a wave movement. It moves like how a puppet/marionette would. Aside from the movement, there is also a rain effect.\nChief is a stunning, 300-pound kinetic sculpture by Anthony Howe that leverages on the wind to move. It is 200 feet tall, 64 feet wide, and 64 feet in diameter.\nAnother kinetic sculpture that uses wind to move, Fishbone emulates the swimming movement of a fish in water. It is made of stainless steel and an invention by Patryk Krol.\n10. Updated Unicyclist\nA balancing unicyclist desk toy created by Kyles Kinetics. It’s more of a toy than an art piece, but it looks good enough to work as an office accessory. The self-balancing unicyclist can be tilted to extreme degrees without falling over.\n11. Breaking Wave\nBreaking Wave is a kinetic sculpture made with 804 metallic balls which illustrates our quest to find order in chaos. And find it they did from two specific perspectives: a “labyrinth within the circle” and a “spiral pattern”. Watch the video to see it in action.\n12.

Avian Pursuit Kinetic Sculpture\nA kinetic sculpture by Bob Potts that aims to recreate how avians move their wings in flight.\n14. Rotating Head by Marcus Raetz\nMarcuz Raetz created this rotating head using light and the three-dimensional effects of rotating metal pieces. The illusion results in a “head turning” display.\n15. U-Ram Choe’s ‘Guardian of the Hole’ at the Asia Society Museum\n“Guardian of the Hole” is a kinetic sculptureby U-Ram Choe that can be found in the Asia Society Museum. It’s an art depiction of movements we recognize as life, like the belly of a beast in mid-breath.\n17. About Face\nAbout Face by Anthony Howe is made using copper panels. As the wind hits it, an internal system of complex gears are set in motion, making the copper cups turn themselves around.\n18. The Orrery\nThe Orrery was built by Ken Toonz over the course of ten months. It recreates the motion of the planets in our solar system using a series of intricate gears on top of each other. It also works as a calendar.\n19. Matrix by David C Roy\nMatrix was built by artist David C. Roy. The Matrix can run for 3 hours straight by just winding the panels 24 times. It is made completely out of wood and works perfectly as a moving wall art.\n20. Animaris Gubernare\nAnimaris Gubernare was build by Theo Jansen. Made of wood, autonomous and appearing to have a mind of its own, these are jansen’s creatures that will move where the wind takes them.\n21. Kinetic-Ring by Dukno Yoon\nA simple kinetic artwork by Dukno Yoon. It is operated by wearing it like a ring and by bending the finger. It mimics how a butterfly or a bird would flap its wings, while at the same time gaining altitude.\n22. Mechanical Running Wolf\nWhile this mechanical running wolf by Andrew Chase does not necessarily move on its own volition, the beauty of it is that it can be moved like how an actual wolf can. All joints, head turns, the way it arches its back and movse its tail are perfectly crafted.\n23. Study in Bird Motion\nThis artwork by Joyce Lin is made of popsicle sticks. It mimics a bird’s flapping wings. The entire motion can be activated by turning a crank by hand.\nOars is a kinetic sculpture made by Bob Potts, depicting how seafarers move their ships by oar and human strength. Using intricate metal gears and rods, Potts managed to elegantly capture the movement of the oars.\n25.

35	What are the characteristics of childhood vs adult language learning, and how do theoretical approaches explain these differences?	Children acquire language naturally through exposure, developing fluency in multiple languages if exposed early enough. This ability diminishes approaching puberty. In contrast, adult language acquisition is a deliberate, intellectual process that rarely achieves native-like fluency, especially in pronunciation. From a theoretical perspective, researchers emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of language acquisition, combining behaviorist, cognitivist and sociocultural approaches. The field shows vitality through theoretical disputes and examines both linguistic systems and social contexts of language learning.	['The current paper “Language processing capacities and learning abilities” draws upon different approaches towards the topic of bilingualism, which often interfere with broader topics, such as politics, psychology, and culture. A large part of researchers focus on the theoretical issues of linguistics…\nLust and Foley (2004) indicate that the rapid progress in the field of L1 acquisition, combined with the challenge of increasingly interdisciplinary literature, has turned into an overwhelming challenge to all scholars in the field. Their volume contains research into the philosophy and science of language acquisition. Articles include discoveries about the way children acquire abstract systems combining discrete symbolic elements in a language. Lust and Foley’s selected readings have an emphasis on linguistic theory, and they assert that theoretical positions in the field have often become polarized. Theoretical disputes are interpreted as a sign of vitality in the field.Johnson (2004) focuses on a review of traditional cognitive approaches to second language acquisition research, and offers a more sociocultural perspective. Her work reviews behaviorist, cognitivist, and information processing approaches to SLA. The author makes an overview of Vygotsky’s theory, including discussion of inter- and intrapersonal interaction, the proximal development zone, and the role of language in mental processes development. She emphasizes the need to explore local second language ability, in terms of social environment, local genres, and institutional contexts.Bialystok et al. (2008) performed two studies to investigate lexical access in bilinguals. In the first one, monolinguals performed better than bilinguals on tests of naming and letter fluency, but not on category fluency. No differences existed with regard to vocabulary size ...\nCite this document\n(“Language processing capacities and learning abilities Dissertation”, n.d.)\nRetrieved from https://studentshare.net/education/384933-language-processing-capacities-and-learning-abilities\n(Language Processing Capacities and Learning Abilities Dissertation)\n“Language Processing Capacities and Learning Abilities Dissertation”, n.d. https://studentshare.net/education/384933-language-processing-capacities-and-learning-abilities.\nThe introduction chapter explained the rationale, scope, and limitation of the research along with highlighting the structure of the dissertation.

Various technologies have been developed to facilitate communication among people all over the world. Globalization has increased demand for second language to enable people realize full benefits from it. It is indisputable that in the new millennium English has become the most demanded international language. The necessity to use English in the modern world is evident everywhere. In various places of the world parents are sending children to bilingual schools or emersion pre-schools to provide them with a head start of learning English language.\n1.2 Childhood Second Language Acquisition\nAcquiring language at a tender age is a natural process which results from prolonged exposure to a certain language. Whereas the written language has to be taught to the children, a spoken one does not need to be taught formally to children. Every kid develops a fluent language if consistent exposure is made within a social setting. In this case, the child is not limited to understanding one language, but may acquire a native fluency in as many languages as he/she is exposed to. However, the natural ability to develop an understanding of a spoken language diminishes sharply as one approaches puberty. Beyond this age, acquiring new language requires deliberate effort. In essence, the exposure to a new language in teenage results in a definite interference with the language or languages learnt earlier.\n1.3 Adulthood Second Language Acquisition\nIn adulthood language acquisition is a learning process. The process is deliberate, intellectual, painful, and hardly leads to a total native-like fluency compared to those who acquire it when young. This deficiency is more evident if learning is made at phonetic level. In this case, the adult who acquires a second language usually speaks it with some non-native accents.\nSecond language acquisition does not necessarily mean acquiring the second language, rather, it means acquiring any other language in addition to the ones already known. The fist language is not a barrier for second language acquisition (Ellis, 1994). This is because children are able to acquire the second, third, or any other number of languages as long as they are exposed to them early enough. Therefore, maturity and age determine the ease of acquiring the second language as opposed to the first language.\n1.4 Learning and Teaching English\nThere are different methods used in teaching. Some of them include use of lectures, brainstorming, panel of experts, class discussion, videotapes, role-playing, and inviting guest speakers among others. Different institutions use different modes of instructions. These modes include: peer teaching, case studies, class instructions, journal articles, and textbooks among others. The mode used depends on the nature of material being taught. Use of peer teaching in second language acquisition has a widespread use.\nThe appropriate teaching technique to be used should depend on student’s learning style for better understanding. Generally, there are three major learning styles. A learning style refers to the preferred method by which an individual learns and remembers what he learnt. One of the learning styles is the visual style. In this case, the learner is able to remember whatever he read or learnt by creating mental pictures of what he experienced. Such individuals learn easily by seeing and their memory is attached to a strong visual association. Use of peer teaching among these learners proves to be very helpful because proper use of demonstrations is made.\nSecondly, there are learners who learn best by listening: auditory learners. They prefer conversations and storytelling, which are possible techniques of peer teaching. The third learning style is the kinesthetic style. Here the learner needs to play and touch whatever they are learning about. The kind of freedom that these learners require may be achieved through peer teaching and hence facilitate the second language acquisition.\n1.5 Statement of the Problem\nAs globalization spreads, interactions among people increase. People require moving across continents and their success in doing so is dependent on the ability to communicate with the natives in every destination. This has led to higher demand for the international languages (Ellis, 1985). It is easier to learn a new language while young but because this is a new phenomenon, we have many adults who need to learn second language. English seems to be the leading language in the current world and many techniques have been developed to teach it to adults. Among them is the peer teaching technique which has gained popularity from its effectiveness in achieving the expected objectives. Although many researches were done regarding peer teaching in linguistic, little is known about the peer teaching benefits and challenges. This study seeks to describe the benefits and challenges experienced in English peer teaching.\n1.6 Significance of the Study\nThe research findings will be availed to different groups of people to facilitate peer teaching. These will include students and teachers in order to discover areas that may require improvement. The institution management may also use the findings when formulating policies.\n1.7 Objective of the study\n1.8 Research questions\nChapter 2: Literature Review\n2.1 General Literature\nAccording to Zander (1974), peer teaching has significant impact on generating teamwork among the students. Students achieve higher motivational levels than they would do if they were studying on their own taught exclusively by a teacher. Denying students a chance to create groups undermines the group efforts and the society loses the benefits that it would get from teamwork.\nAccording to Bruner (1972), the teaching processes benefit both the tutee and the tutor. By allowing the student to pick the teaching role among themselves is giving them new opportunities of acquiring new knowledge (De, 1978). He further explains that peer teaching results to increased self-confidence, increased motivation, better cooperation among students, raises self-esteem, and reduces the destructive competitive behavior among the learners. Piaget (1971) advocates peer teaching as a way of developing active learning for knowledge development.\n2.2 Specific Literature\nBrewster (1984) provided an insight on the benefits that are realized from incorporating peer teaching in institutions. One of the advantages that he discusses relates to the cost of teaching. He asserts that the demand for knowledge such as the second language acquisition, leads to a higher student-teacher ratio (Ortega, 2009). Incorporating peer teaching leads to reduced cost without compromising the learning outcomes. A detailed analysis by Whitman (1988) revealed existence of different groups with different understanding of the subject matter. Such groups are relevant to encourage development of understanding through increased self-esteem. He emphasizes the paramount influence that co-peer teaching has in learning.\nAccording to Selinker and Grass (2001) acquiring second language involves learning a nonnative language. They found out that acquiring new language requires conducive environment with efficient access to fluent speakers of the targeted language. As such, peer tutors with better understanding of the target knowledge are better positioned to help others learn (Krashen, 1982).\n2.3 Conceptual Model\nSecond language acquisition using peer teaching involves a learning process that has to be worked out well. In any case, students must be motivated to appreciate taking the role of teachers. Also, the environment should encourage engagements among the students. Active engagement promotes group formation and hence group learning.\nChapter 3: Research Methodology\n3.1 Research Design\nThe objective of this study is to generate understanding of the challenges faced during peer teaching of English and the benefits realized. This research will use data from primary sources of University of Toronto. It will involve interviewing teachers and student on matters related to learning English as a second language. The interview schedule will be prepared one month before the study and a pre-test will be performed in Ontario Institute for Studies in Education. The pre-test will help evaluate the effectiveness of questionnaire and method of analysis in meeting objectives of the study. The questionnaire will consist of open-ended questions to help probe information from the respondents.\n3.2 Data Collection\nOne hundred people comprising of teachers and student from University of Toronto will be interviewed. The sample is significantly large to reduce the sampling error and allow making non-biased conclusions. The method of simple random sampling will be used. Information received from the respondents will be used to fill the questionnaire. The data will then be coded to facilitate analysis. Similar responses will be given similar codes to use statistical analysis.\n3.3 Data Analysis\nThe quantitative analysis will be appropriate for this study to help generalize the result to the entire population of adults who are striving to acquire their second language in learning institutions. Data analysis tools such as regression will be used to understand relationships and the degree of correlation between the dependent and independent variables.\n3.4 Presentation and Recommendations\nThe collected data will be represented by use of tabular and graphical presentation. This may involve presentation of trends in second language acquisition upon introduction of peer teaching. As such, the finding will be easy to understand and hence useful to the policy makers in institutions that are considering incorporating peer teaching.\n3.5 Ethical Consideration\nThis study will be conducted in accordance to the ethical values of the society. As such, no respondent will be forced to participate in the interview. The interviews will also begin will privacy assurance to create confidence among the respondents. Informed consent will be sought from all respondents.']	['<urn:uuid:95ce6771-8356-47e0-b06a-d916e858aea3>', '<urn:uuid:90c3743e-e8e3-42bc-9813-be90e012fafc>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	18	74	2380

This phenomenon, scientifically known as aurora borealis, is the result of charged particles released by the sun colliding with gaseous particles in the Earth’s atmosphere, occurring near the magnetic poles. (It also takes place in the southern hemisphere, where it’s known as aurora australis.)\nSeeing the lights is never a guarantee, but heading to the right place in the right season can increase your odds dramatically — and there’s plenty of active, adventurous fun to be had in the process. Families can hike, cruise or reindeer sleigh as they try to catch a glimpse of the elusive aurora. Here are 5 ideas for working the Northern Lights into an unforgettable kid-friendly escape.\n5 Great Ways to See the Northern Lights\nGo Adventuring in Fairbanks, Alaska\nHow about ice fishing or dog sledding while you wait for those colorful bands to appear? Sitting within the oval-shaped zone of aurora activity, Fairbanks is the best U.S. location to see the Northern Lights, in part because of its distance from the coast and low precipitation. While the auroras can technically be seen year-round, Fairbanks’ aurora season is from August 21 to April 21, when skies tend to be clear and dark enough. If you prefer a more relaxed approach, you can also view the lights while staying in a glass-ceiling dome at Borealis Basecamp.\nExplore Iceland’s Rugged Landscape\nIn the Land of Fire and Ice, combine the quest for an aurora sighting (September through March) with hiking, ice climbing, glacier walking and soaking in the geothermal waters of the Blue Lagoon. Backroads offers a six-day Northern Lights Family Adventure, which includes activities such as hiking to 650-foot-high Glymur Waterfall, snowshoeing in Thingvellir National Park, walking on a glacier by day and searching the sky for nature’s electrifying light show by night.\nWant help planning a Northern Lights vacation with kids?\nOur Family Vacation Advisors can work with you one on one to choose the right destination, book kid-friendly accommodations, arrange private tours and guides, and more.

Along with the typical excursions and culinary highlights, being on a ship limits the light pollution from land and allows for multiple opportunities to see the lights, since you’re always moving. Go from October to March for the best chances. Hurtigruten also offers a special 12-day astronomy cruise with expert astronomers onboard.\nTry Reindeer Sleighing in Finland\nIt’s been calculated that the Northern Lights are visible approximately 200 nights of the year in Finnish Lapland, which has made the area, and its glass igloos, world famous. Skies are dark enough for viewing starting in late August and lasting through April. Along with snowshoeing, cross-country skiing and snowmobiling, reindeer-driven sleighs are an active way to go about aurora spotting. Catch the reindeer express at the Northern Lights Village, which offers accommodations, activities and restaurants onsite. Alternately, consider Hotel Iso Syote’s cottages, configured to accommodate families, or some of the area’s more luxe digs like the Arctic TreeHouse Hotel.\nHead Into the Canadian Wilderness\nFrom the Yukon Territory to Churchill, Manitoba to Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories, northern Canada offers a number of places with ideal conditions for seeing the Northern Lights. Mid-November to April is peak viewing season, but the phenomenon appears about 240 nights out of the year — that’s a rate of 65 percent! As a bonus, Churchill is also home to wildlife like peregrine falcons, snowy owls, Arctic terns and, of course, polar bears. The best time of year to see polar bears in the wild is October and November, when the bears move from their summer homes to seal hunting.']"	['<urn:uuid:a5b9dc45-97d6-4b6d-9040-5db5dd19a237>', '<urn:uuid:f2c46874-9088-4ef7-878e-e667bd112d15>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	29	57	1230

['Dow’s Ambition for Operational Excellence\nMost people have heard the name “Dow.” Dow Chemical Company is a global, diversified company serving many markets. Dow touches many parts of daily life, from automobile and industrial applications to athletic shoes and dish soap.\nDow is a well-respected manufacturer employing around 53,000 employees, including a sizable engineering staff that helps design and operate their production plants.\nDow was recognized for several extraordinary qualities at Frost & Sullivan’s 11th annual Manufacturing Leadership Summit, where it was named “Manufacturer of the Year, Large Enterprise.” At the top of the list was “Operational Excellence Leadership.”\nDow has a large Six Sigma adoption and prides itself on operational excellence. Dow recognizes the efficiency and safety implications of standard operating procedures. “Dow personnel emphasize consistent work process execution across all sites around the world,” explains Gregg Schuler, Product Manager for Data Integration and Engineering Document Management for Dow. “We have a sizable investment in written best practices for process design, project execution and plant operation that provide a significant and sustainable competitive advantage for Dow,” he adds.\nDow’s Strategic View of Engineering Document Management\nEngineering document management (EDM) is a critical capability for manufacturers like Dow. As Mr. Schuler explains, “EDM can impact both the operational and the detailed engineering design components of our business.” Given its scale, Dow has to manage a large number of documents across the globe for both new capital projects andĂ‚Â as-built drawings.\nEDM is a proven capability that helps companies improve efficiency and control. Dow values document management for more than just project efficiency. Dow places safety as a top priority. It recognizes the significant impact good documentation has on reducing risk and measure when information is a contributing factor in their root cause analysis of issues in the field. Clearly, Dow views EDM as a critical, strategic capability.\nDow’s Engineering Document ManagementĂ‚Â Systems History\nDow was ahead of the curve in the 1980’s with the adoption of document management to store plant and engineering documents. But Dow began to recognize that its document management systems were no longer able to to support its high level of process excellence. “Our document management initiative started because a Six Sigma project identified gaps and problems with our storage of as-built documents,” recalls Mr. Schuler. “We had usability issues, constrained access, and limited ability to collaborate across sites; and inefficiencies because we could not quickly find the right document versions.”\nDow had lost their edge in document management technology over time, partially because Dow includes a number of acquired businesses that had their own systems and legacy data. “We had a large variety of different document management systems at the time, and all of them had some usability or supportability issue,” explains Barbara Migl, CAE Technology Leader for Dow. “Some of the solutions were no longer being supported, and some sites just used file shares.”\nDow’s Engineering Document Management Systems Opportunity and Objectives\nDow has plants all over the world and has major engineering centers in the US, Europe and India. Efficiently sharing work and information across these sites has huge benefits. Dow’s document management systems were not prepared to consistently support Dow’s operations. The status quo did not support Dow’s objective of providing a globally consistent, single point of access to engineering documents which would enable a step change in global document access and drive global collaboration.\nBeyond that, Dow Engineering Solutions has a long-term vision to integrate the engineering design and construction work processes and expose the resulting information in an “asset view” versus a “document view.” This approach allows people to find all of the relevant information about a specific piece of equipment by making a single query. Centralizing all plant engineering documents into a single environment with consistent metadata is a key first step in that vision. To improve current operational support and help achieve Dow’s longer-term vision, it was time for Dow to make a change in EDM.\nDow Searches for a Better Document Management System\nOriginally, Dow planned to select one of their existing solutions and implement it worldwide. But as Ms. Migl explains, “Our investigation of all the systems showed that not one of them was acceptable for retention.” Dow began looking for a new solution and initiated in a rigorous selection process lasting about a year and a half. The company took a very systematic approach driven by a Six Sigma process.\nDow created a team with representatives from all of the major current document management system owners. The team developed a list of 85 critical requirements based on the best features from all the existing systems. Ms. Migl explains the process; “We rated the relative importance of each requirement from absolutely ‘must-have’ to ‘would-like-to-have.’ Then we evaluated each of the tools based on those requirements and we were able to eliminate all but two.” They originally looked at eight vendors, analyzed four at a very detailed level, and then narrowed it down to those two for a proof of concept where they installed the software in a pilot environment.\nDow Partners with Synergis Software\nAs a result of the detailed evaluation process, Dow chose Adept from Synergis Software because it:\n- met their detailed criteria\n- is fast to install and implement\n- is a simple solution that was easy for users to adopt without significant training\n- is easy to tailor to unique needs of different sites without requiring custom coding\nDuring the pilot, each vendor was required to load 100,000 existing Dow documents. The competing solution struggled. “It was weeks invested for the alternative versus days in Adept,” shares Mr. Schuler. Adept also proved very easy to use, “I can teach people how to find documents in Adept in 30 minutes,” he added.\nDow initially had some concern about the solution’s ability to handle their large number of drawings and the diversity of their users from all over the world. Ms. Migl, however, says “I will say that so far, Adept appears to be working really well, so that has been a win.” Cost was also a factor, with some systems costing five times more than Adept. The bottom line is that Adept was the low-risk approach for Dow to get documents under control. Dow was on the way to a new, improved EDM solution.\nInitial Adoption Wins Supporters\nDow’s initial plan was to use Adept to manage as-built plant documents. But Dow’s Engineering Group needed immediate document management support for a large capital project. The project personnel discovered that meeting customer reporting requirements via their standard Windows file-share storage methods would have been problematic. “They came to us and said, ‘Can you do something to set up a document management repository for our project?’ and in about six weeks from start to finish we had something in place,” recalls Mr. Schuler. Adept proved to be fast to implement and easy to adopt. “I think it was a big surprise to people how quickly we could deploy something to solve their problems, and we did it all ourselves,” he adds.\n“Synergis helped kick-start our team with initial configuration and training services, and from there, we did the site specific implementations all ourselves,” notes Mr. Schuler. Having Synergis involved up front accelerated the overall implementation.”\nAfter that initial success, Dow implemented Adept at their largest site, in Freeport, Texas, replacing an existing homegrown tool. Dow implemented the solution, managed the migration, and trained site personnel by themselves. A customer satisfaction survey conducted several months after the implementation showed very positive results. “Adept has done exactly what we expected it to do, and more,” shares Ms. Migl. “It has been extremely well-received by the users.” The initial Adept adoption was a clear win.\nExpanding Adept’s Value across Global Dow Sites\nBased on early successes, there is a “pull” of demand from other parts of Dow. As other plants began asking for Adept, the Dow team developed a systematic way to determine who will get the system next based on a systematic prioritization based on:\nDow rolls out Adept using templates that include a default design and a security model which is used consistently in all implementations. But Adept also allows Dow to offer its sites some flexibility. “Some sites have very specific work processes that we don’t want to break, so we have to allow some flexibility in our design,” Mr. Schuler says.\nThe next implementation was another large site, this time in the Netherlands. That site created a design and conducted usability testing remotely from the US and only went onsite to participate in the training and to kick-start the initial migration. Mr. Schuler says this is “a testament to the relative ease of use of the product.”\nExtending Adept’s Value into New Departments\nMr. Schuler explains that each new site rollout uncovers additional Adept opportunities. He gets calls from people in various plant roles asking, “Wow, you know my stuff was not in that old system, but can I put it in Adept?” For example, one plant decided to add an additional 300,000 scanned documents that weren’t in the original scope.\nBeyond adding documents to the system, plants want to expand access to more departments. For example, Dow has a growing set of customers in the Operations and Maintenance areas. Today they’re finding documents using spreadsheets with links and file shares. “It’s a huge area of potential improvement. We believe there’s tremendous value to expand access to the documents in Adept.” explains Mr. Schuler.\nEnjoying the Benefits of Centralized Document Management\nAdept is providing important business results for Dow, brought via centrally unified information and more consistent processes. There are groups of engineers all around the world that need document access to do project and operations work in a consistent way across Dow. “Adept empowers our engineers to get the data they need when they need it,” shares Ms. Migl.\nMr. Schuler explains that the benefits of Adept at a high level are reducing costs and accelerating schedules, but the benefits vary by site based on their needs. For example, he says that if you ask Freeport, Texas users about the value, they might say they can check out a document in only seconds now versus minutes before, or that they can find things much quicker. “It’s the culmination of those hundreds of small improvements that can make everybody’s day a little bit easier,” Mr. Schuler offers.\nAchieving Benefits beyond Expectations\nThe Adept project was originally justified more as an imperative to ensure continued, uninterrupted, efficient access to the millions of documents that represent how Dow’s plants are built. But they always felt there was a lot of upside opportunity. For example Ms. Migl shares that “Adept has value in increasing the speed of projects. That can be extremely significant. Time to market is critical for market-facing businesses.”\nThe original scope for Adept was to replace the functionality of the various plant document management systems across the Dow enterprise. Beyond replicating what the old systems did, Mr. Schuler explains that Adept is changing the way Dow does business because of its flexibility to handle a variety of document management scenarios. For example, one plant was working with an engineering firm and realized they could greatly improve process efficiency if their partner added just a few more items of metadata to each document. Adept’s flexibility made it possible to easily extend the metadata at minimal cost.\nAdept Enhances Internal and External Collaboration\nAdept has also improved collaboration across sites. For example, a plant in Terneuzen, the Netherlands, works with remotely located engineers in India. Previously, “collaboration” meant manually zipping up sets of documents and copying those zips back and forth across different file shares. Now, the remote engineers in India access the documents directly in Adept, adding tremendous efficiency. Mr. Schuler explains, “The engineers can checkĂ‚Â out documents themselves. It’s much faster and less overhead to do it directly within Adept.”\nDow also uses Adept’s built-in replication functionality, which caches copies of frequently accessed documents local to the users, but automatically synchronizes the copies behind the scenes. Dow has replication servers in India and in Europe, while the main document repository is in the U.S. Such replication cuts document access times for remote locations by up to 80%.\nTogether, these capabilities enable near-real-time collaboration, which, in turn, can bring global expertise quickly to any of Dow’s sites.\nDow Targeting Additional Value from Adept\nThe value that Dow can achieve from Adept is far from tapped out. The Dow team believes that there is much more to come in the future. There are currently more groups in Dow looking for help based on Adept’s prior success. The newest internal customers are the Capital Project engineers and the Purchasing Department that manage the capital project space for receiving, reviewing and returning supplier documents.\nDow also has a plant that is planning to put all of their vendor documents into Adept. Vendors send documents including equipment manuals, replacement parts lists, lubrication schedules, and many others to Dow. Many people need ready access to this information. Currently, however, people wait until the final documents are delivered before manually putting them into a folder to avoid having to replace them when they change. Dow sees an opportunity to eliminate much of that process by putting the documents into Adept as the vendor sends them. “It will reduce the amount of effort, speed up the access to the documents, and reduce the hours spent manipulating these pieces of data,” says Mr. Schuler.\nAnother example where Adept can provide additional value was uncovered by a project-focused Six Sigma effort that discovered that managing supplier documents – the process of getting a document in, marking it up, approving it, or rejecting it and sending it back to the vendor – was a challenge. Dow wanted to track metrics such as how long it took for approvals to manage the process. Based on some testing on Adept, Dow discovered that they can do this with using out-of-the-box Adept functionality.\nDow is a purposeful company that focuses on safety and operational excellence. It recognizes the value brought by EDM, and by having their information in a single, globally accessible system. Its Six Sigma process identified the need to replace existing document management solutions.\nDow adopted Synergis Adept after a rigorous selection process and it has proven to be a valuable solution. Early implementations were very successful, and since that time, Dow’s Adept adoption has expanded to new sites, new plants, and new departments, and many more documents and document types have been added to Adept, beyond the original scope. “Adept met our functional requirements, was easy to configure/maintain, and the cost was right,” shared Mr. Schuler. “Adept has been predictable, reliable, and well- accepted,” adds Ms. Migl. “The tool is beautiful, simple, and elegant. It does not do anything more than it needs to do. That makes it very easy to implement and very easy for people to understand. It is also very easy to roll out.”\nDow has had great success with Synergis and its Adept solution, allowing the company to centralize its plant engineering documents into a single environment with consistent metadata as a key first step in its integrated engineering vision. Dow’s success provides an example for others to improve their own efficiency, reduce costs, lower risk, and speed time to market. Most companies don’t have the scale and complexity issues that Dow does, but it should give other companies comfort to know that the Adept solution at Dow easily scaled to meet the diverse needs of a very large user base, managing millions of documents across a global enterprise. And most companies can appreciate the unmatched simplicity and ease of adoption Adept offers in an enterprise EDM solution.\nSynergis has also proven to be very easy to work with as a company, according to Mr. Schuler. “I would rate Synergis’ level of personalized support, response speed and content quality as superior; a clear step above other software companies with which I’ve worked.”']	['<urn:uuid:6139cbb1-1ab6-47ab-be30-ac2d585406ab>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	9	61	2671
38	Can you explain what changes occur in someone's ability to take care of themselves during different phases of Alzheimer's?	As Alzheimer's progresses through its stages, self-care abilities gradually decline. In the early stages, the person can handle basic daily activities. By the moderately severe stage, they need some assistance but can still eat and use the bathroom independently, though they may need help getting dressed. In the severe cognitive decline stage, they become entirely dependent on others for survival and may have irregular sleep patterns. In the very severe stage, they lose all verbal abilities and need help with eating and using the bathroom. Eventually, they lose the ability to walk as their brain can no longer effectively control their body.	['Everyone is forgetful now and again, and as we age the occurrences may become even more frequent. Yet most people who have mild forgetfulness do not have Alzheimer’s disease. But when memory loss starts to interfere with daily activities, it may be time to consult with a physician about Alzheimer’s awareness.\nAlzheimer’s disease is not a product of the natural aging process. Scientists do not know what causes the disease; however, age is a factor. The disease usually begins after age 60 and the risk goes up with the increase in age. Approximately five million Americans currently suffer from Alzheimer’s disease which is why Alzheimer’s awareness is so important.\nAccording to the National Institute on Aging, there are seven early warning signs of Alzheimer’s disease:\n- Asking the same question over and over again.\n- Repeating the same story, word for word, again and again.\n- Forgetting how to cook, or how to make repairs, or how to play cards—activities that were previously done with ease and regularity.\n- Losing one’s ability to pay bills or balance one’s checkbook.\n- Getting lost in familiar surroundings, or misplacing household objects.\n- Neglecting to bathe, or wearing the same clothes over and over again, while insisting that they have taken a bath or that their clothes are still clean.\n- Relying on someone else, such as a spouse, to make decisions or answer questions they previously would have handled themselves.\nThe Stages of Alzheimer’s\nDeveloped by Elizabeth Ostuni and Mary Jo Pietro, Lincoln, Nebraska, Chapter, Geriatric Care Managers\nEarly “Forgetful” Stages\n- Gets along adequately in most social situations.\n- Digresses from topic in conversation.\n- Relies heavily on clichés.\n- May ramble on and on.\n- Tends to repeat self.\n- Can still handle some casual social situations.\n- Makes vague, empty, irrelevant conversation.\n- Withdraws from difficult social situations.\n- Does not initiate conversation.\n- Repeats ideas over and over.\n- Is excessively self-oriented.\n- Asks fewer questions.\n- Is no longer aware of social interaction or expectancies.\n- Withdraws partially or completely from communication.\nAlthough not everyone experiences the same symptoms in the same order or with the same time schedule, we can generally characterize the progress of the disease in six stages, which may last three to 20 years. Note that these represent stages of brain deterioration; they can be caused by diseases other than Alzheimer’s.\nVery mild cognitive decline: For example, problems such as: subjective complaints about memory deficit such as placement of familiar objects, forgetting names once known well. There is no objective evidence of deficits in social or employment situations. Don’t assume that all confusion and memory loss signal Alzheimer’s. Reactions to medications can cause reversible delirium and other medical problems may cause dementia.

Appropriate responsiveness to outside stimulation decreases sharply. Denial of any problem, and withdrawal from challenging situations are common.\nEarly stage: Moderately severe decline: For example, the person can no longer survive without some assistance. Patients can’t remember names of people or places in their lives. They may be disoriented about time and dates. However, they will require no assistance when using the bathroom or eating, but may need help in getting dressed.\nMiddle stage: Severe cognitive decline: For example, the person may forget name of spouse and be unaware of events in his or her life. He or she is entirely dependent on others for survival. He or she may have trouble sleeping in a regular pattern.\nLate stage: Very severe cognitive decline: For example, all verbal abilities are lost and he or she needs help eating and using the bathroom. Eventually he or she loses the ability to walk; the brain appears to no longer be able to tell the body what to do.\nBased on B.

40	Do Aleuts and Arviarmiut both rely on marine mammals?	Yes, both groups heavily depend on marine mammals - the Aleuts historically relied on fish and sea mammals in the Aleutian region, while Arviarmiut continue to hunt beluga whales, seals and polar bears which are essential for their community's sustenance and social practices.	"['The Aleutian Islands run from the Peninsula of Kamchatka in the Asiatic portion of Russia to Alaska. All the islands are bare and mountainous and the coasts rocky and surrounded by crashing waves and enormous breakers. (Larkin, unpaged) Some believe the Aleutians offer the worst weather in the world: Weather fronts originating in the South Pacific create storms hundreds of miles long and many weeks in duration (Sipes, unpaged) that pick up the frigid moisture of the waters and air as they move northward. It would seem that anyone desirous of living there would need some overwhelming reasons to do so. The Russians and Scandinavians who first \'discovered\' the area for non-natives, and later the Americans, did have good reasons to be there. As for the Aleuts and Alutiiq, an abundance of fish and sea mammals might have been the attraction if, as some theories surmise, they arrived across a land bridge from what we now call Siberia.\nSeveral researchers have advanced the theory that the peopling of the New World involved a northeasterly trending Siberial coastal drift along the continental shelf coast of the Seal of Okhotsk, the Kamchatka Peninsula and along the southern coast of the Bering land-bridge. Those same researchers, Laughlin, Turner and Vasilievsky think that because of the glaciation still present in the area of the Aleutian chain, the settlement happened via interior settlement. In other words, those who migrated into the interior later trekked, clambered or boated amidst the pack ice to populate, eventually, the archipelagos, including the Aleutians. This same second migratory wave of Siberian peoples also settled the British Columbia coast, and later drifted further south toe southern California. The same researchers say that the dental morphology of the prehistoric California Indians is much like that of all other Indians of North and South America, and very unlike that of the Aleuts and Alutiiq, which is in opposition to earlier theories. (Turner, 391+)\nTurner also mentions that there have been stories of non-terrestrial migration, and then refutes that statement by saying ""There are no known individuals or groups (or even stories of anyone) who boated in either direction between Siberia and Alaska along today\'s southern edge of the Bering Sea pack ice or the Davis Strait pack ice between Greenland and Canada."" (291+) On the other hand, he also mentions those who have advocated various trans-Pacific drift theories because of the some Jomon boatmen who introduced pottery from Japan to Ecuador, citing the work of Meggers in 1965. (Turner, 291+)\nBy whatever route the Aleut and Alutiiq arrived, they are thought to have been there at least 11,000 to 14,000 years ago, according to artifacts found in archaeological excavations. On the other hand, linguistic analyses have set the date at between 12,000 and 35,000 years ago. Nuclear mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies suggest an arrival time of about 30,000 years ago; they also suggest that migration is much more complex than previously thought, and that multiple migrations and expansion of ancient peoples contributed to genetic diversity in all Siberian and Amerindian peoples, including the Aleut and Alutiiq. Research on dental variation suggests an arrival time of between 18,000 and 20,000 years ago. (Schurr, 246) Obviously there is wide latitude on timing. But the dental morphology does, at least, pinpoint what group the Aleut and Alutiiq might be part of.\nThe mtDNA reveals that of the original migrations to the Americas, the majority of modern Native American haplotypes belong to a mere four mtDNA lineages, designated A, B, C and D. A comparison of Native Americans, Siberians and Asians reveals that the same mtDNA lineages in all groups share the same sorts of mutations; the explanation most often offered is that the mutations arose in Asia in the founding lineages and were carried to the New World by ancestral Native Americans. These mutations are, moreover, of considerable age, suggesting that the lings between Siberian and Native American peoples are quite ancient. And, it appears that the ancient Beringian populations -- that is, those in the vicinity of the Bering Strait -- gave rise to the Chukchi, the Eskimo-Aleuts and the Na-Dene Indians about 7,000 to 13,000 years ago.\nWhatever the process was all those eons ago, it is clear that there were correspondences between the Aleut and Alutiiq and people from Siberia long before the modern Russian arrived in the archipelago. The group considered to be the Aleut people today are found mainly from the tip of the Alaska Peninsula all along the arc of the Aleutian Islands, which extend for about 1,500 miles. The Alutiiq, however, are really more germane to the Kodiak Island area and its archipelago, known as the Kodiak area, and lying about four hundred miles east of the Aleutians. They are also found on the mainland coasts from Chugach Bay to an area farther east. Their culture is Pacific Rim with a Russian infusion. Their language is classified as Eskimoan because it is more closely related to Yup\'ik and Inupiaq (Inuit) than to Aleut. Anthropologists also sometimes refer to the Kodiak area Alutiiqs as Koniaq, a term that was derived from 18th century Russian sources who had assimilated the world Kanaa\'in for the Kodiak area people. (Mousalimas, 1) The language itself is very likely extinct, at least as spoken through the eons before the arrival of the modern Russians, and the Scandinavians and Americans. There were once 20 native Eskimo and Indian languages in Alaska. The Eyak language, once found on Alaska\'s south coast, died when the second of two living speakers died in the early 1990s. There was also a linguistic divide between NaDene language speakers (Tlingit, Dena\'ina and Eyak) and Aleut-Eskimo speakers (including Unanagan and Alutiiq.) (Crowell, unpaged) Most of these languages, also, are moribund, or possibly already gone as they were endangered as long ago as 1993. The only two surviving languages are Siberian Yup\'ik, which had 1,000 speakers in 1993, and Central Yup\'ik, which had 10,000 speakers in 1993. Diamond, unpaged.) These languages, regarded as the Aleut-Eskimo type, might have been known to the ancient Aleut and Alutiiq peoples.\nWhile the extinct or nearly extinct languages of a people are difficult to reconstruct, it is somewhat easier to find out how they lived. The first wave of migration is assumed to have foraged, mainly. Later, by about 3,500 BC, permanent winter villages of semi-subterranean or plank housing was in place. At that time, where was significant population growth, increased village and household size, and emergence of social ranking. There was also widespread warfare, and complex artistic, mortuary and ceremonial traditions. (Crowell, unpaged)\nRelatively little research aimed specifically toward Aleut or Alutiiq peoples has been done, except as part of the major projects regarding the area from the eastern Aleutian Islands to the queen Charlotte Islands of British Columbia. However, because the populations show a common descent from founding Paleoarctic populations, and a high level of continued interaction over time, it seems logical to infer information about the Aleut and Alutiiq lifestyles from shared characteristics. And, in fact, the area surrounding the Gulf of Alaska offers one of the longest archaeological records of maritime adaptation in the Americas, possibly because of its bountiful numbers of marine mammals, fish, bird and other necessities for supporting human life, even in an inhospitable climate. (Crowell, unpaged)\nCrowell notes that geographic unity is a main reason to consider the Aleut (Unangan) and Alutiiq (Pacific Eskimo) cultures along with those of the other peoples that ring the Gulf, the subarctic Athapaskan Indian and the Northwest Coast Indian, despite the differences in language. As a basis for considering them all at once, Crowell says:\nAt the time of Russian and European contact in the late eighteenth century, all of the Gulf of Alaska peoples had maritime-focused subsistence economies, with universal reliance on salmon and sea mammals. Other fish species (e.g., halibut, herring, cod, rockfish, eulachon), intertidal invertebrates, birds, plant foods (berries, starchy roots, seaweed, spruce cambium), and land animals (caribou, elk, mountain goats, grizzly bear, black bear) were variously important in the diet, depending on location. (Crowell, unpaged)\nThis meant that all the peoples would need watercraft, and in fact, they all had highly developed sand specialized kayaks, open skin boats and wooden canoes; for hunting and fishing, they also developed specialized tools.\nWinter houses were built either of driftwood timbers or earth. And, as well, ""Functional and stylistic similarities in clothing, jewelry, containers, weapons, and other items of material culture reflected high levels of regional interaction and cultural exchange, sustained by local and long-distance trading, raiding, slave-taking, and intermarriage."" (Crowell, unpaged)\nIn addition similarities in housing and provisioning, the Aleuts and Alutiiq also had similar sociopolitical organizations. Total community sizes could exceed 1,000 people. Within that community, resource ownership and exploitation was by co residential corporate kin groups of from 15 to 40 people. Social status of those people was based on a combination of wealth and birth, with division into at least free and slave classes, sometimes…\n""Native Peoples Of The Aleutian Island Chain Specifically The Aleute Alutiiq"" (2004, May 10) Retrieved June 20, 2017, from http://www.paperdue.com/essay/native-peoples-of-the-aleutian-island-chain-170303\n""Native Peoples Of The Aleutian Island Chain Specifically The Aleute Alutiiq"" 10 May 2004.

Living along the coastline, Arviarmiut (the people of Arviat) take advantage of the affordances offered by land and sea in hunting, travel and leisure. During one year of fieldwork, employing participant observation as my predominant methodology, I set out to understand the role of the sea in the lives of Arviarmiut. At this high latitude the sea is in a constant state of change throughout the year, from open water to sea ice and back again. This marked seasonality is central to Arviarmiut interaction with the sea, based on the fluidity and adaptability of individual and social practices. Knowledge, perception and use of the sea are grounded in these practices both within the community and at sea. In both contexts, knowledge of the sea is intimately tied to identity, and embodied in performance. Adopting a dwelling perspective, I examine how knowledge of the physical characteristics of the sea and of marine animals is acquired, how it grows throughout a person's lifetime, and how sensory perception and embodied orientations are central to movement and wayfinding while at sea or on the sea ice. The detailed knowledge of marine environmental phenomena (tides and currents, winds, sea ice, waves, the movements of seaweed) and of the behaviour of marine animals (beluga whales, seals, polar bears and fish) possessed by Arviarmiut is essential to safety and success. The tools required for activities at sea and the animals harvested from it are shared and passed around the community through kin, church and community-based networks. Thus socially, economically and symbolically, the sea plays an important role in community life. However, Arviarmiut have a number of concerns regarding their future as sustainable mariners. Three cases exemplify this point. The imposition of quotas limiting the hunting of important marine species is considered to be a threat to a way of life dependent on adaptation and fluidity. In the case of polar bears, the quota is deemed to place Inuit lives at risk, and in the case of beluga whales, there is a fear that the future imposition of a quota will adversely affect social relations and impact on hunting practices. Climate change is viewed by many Arviarmiut to lead to more danger at sea, as conditions are no longer as predictable as they once were. Animals are perceived to be moving around and behaving differently as a result of these changing sea conditions and weather patterns. Finally, there is a growing concern over contaminants in the food chain. Inuit fear that nutritionally and socially important foods are no longer safe to eat and are threatening the very health of those who rely on them. Arviarmiut are dealing with these perceived threats to their way of life in novel ways. While perception, knowledge and use of the sea are affected by these changes, Inuit are attempting to adapt and to incorporate them into their ways of being and dwelling within the marine environment. Ultimately, despite their impact on social relationships and relationships with the environment, many Arviarmiut are confident of their ability to adapt to the changes taking place around them and to retain the resilience of their way of living within their environment.""]"	['<urn:uuid:f208e6e8-7c9f-4ac5-88b4-a670d8e95596>', '<urn:uuid:a32a700e-beec-49d2-8aa9-51d3cda6e7f9>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	9	43	2103
41	In what ways do the ancient Sanskrit texts of the Brahma Sutras and the Buddhist sources examined by Warder face similar challenges in terms of preservation and interpretation?	Both the Brahma Sutras and Buddhist texts face significant interpretative challenges. The Brahma Sutras are noted to be extremely terse and often incomprehensible without proper commentary, with Sanskrit's elasticity allowing different interpretations based on intellectual caliber and spiritual experiences. Similarly, Buddhist texts faced preservation challenges, with only scattered texts surviving in various locations such as Japan, Tibet, Jaina libraries in western India, or buried in Central Asia. Both require careful interpretation and analysis, with the Brahma Sutras needing extensive commentaries for understanding, while Buddhist texts require comparison of multiple sources across different languages for proper interpretation.	"[""Brahma Sutras is one of the books of Prasthana-traya and is an authoritative book on Hindu Philosophy. The Brahma Sutras are attributed to Badarayana. However, some authors including Adi Shankara treat Badarayana, the author of the Brahma Sūtra, as a distinct person, than Krishna Dwipayana Vyasa, the author of the Mahabharata.\nThere are six schools of classical Indian philosophy, namely: Nyaya, Vaisheshhika, Sankhya, Yoga, Mimansa and Vedanta. Sutras are pithy statements that elaborate upon some specific aspect of the field and thus serve as a point of reference for all matters of philosophical import. The authors of each school's sutra are called sutra-karas. They are\nGautama (મહર્ષિ ગૌતમ) for the Nyaya School,\nKanada(મહર્ષિ કણદ) for the Vaisheshika School,\nKapila (મહર્ષિ કપિલ) for the Samkhya School,\nPatanjali (મહર્ષિ પતંજલિ) for the Yoga School,\nJaimini (મહર્ષિ જૈમિનિ) for the Mimansa School, and\nBadarayan (બાદરાયણ) for the Vedanta School.\nUpanishads (Shruti prasthāna, the starting point of revelation) and the Bhagavad-Gita (Smriti prasthana, the starting point of remembered tradition) are the basic source texts of Vedanta school. The Brahma Sutras attempt to reconcile the seemingly contradictory and diverse statements of the various Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita, by placing each teaching in a doctrinal context.\nThe word sutra means thread, and the Brahma Sutras literally stitch together the various Vedanta teachings into a systematic and logical order. At the time of composition of Brahma Sutras, there were difference of opinion among the various interpreters of the Vedānta namely Audulomi, Jaimini, Badarayan to name a few. Brahma Sutra seamlessly arrange and interprete their views and offer conclusion.\nBrahma Sutras consists of 555 Sutras (aphorisms) arranged in Adhikaranas (topics) and divided in 16 Padas (sections) inside 4 Adhyayas (chapters). The very first sutra which says athato brahma jignasa – Now, therefore the inquiry (into the real nature of Brahman) set tone for discussion. Besides elaborating upon Brahman, Brahma Sutras discuss the role of karma and God and critically address the various doctrines associated with Buddhism, Jainism, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Shaiva, Shakta, Atheism, and Sankhya philosophies.\nSanskrit is very elastic. One can derive different meaning according to his own intellectual calibre and spiritual experiences. The Brahma Sutras are so terse that not only are they capable of being interpreted in multiple ways, but they are often incomprehensible without proper commentary.\nMany commentaries have been written on Brahma Sutras, the earliest one being the one by Adi Shankara with his non-dualistic (Advaita) interpretation of the Vedānta. It was subsequently commented by Vachaspati and Padmapada. Ramanuja’s commentary, also called Sri Bhasya, lays the foundations of the Vishisht-advaita tradition and refutes Adi Shankara’s Advaita views. Other commentators on the Brahma Sutras include Bhaskara, Yadavaprakasa, Kesava, Nilakantha, Madhvacharya, Vallabha, Vijnanabhiksu and Nimbarka.\nTheir commentaries are in Sanskrit and are too short and insufficient for a comprehensive study or are extremely tough to be of any use by men of ordinary understanding. The work of Yogeshwarji on Brahma Sutra in Gujarati language is unique in itself and is unrivalled by any other. His commentary is neither too short to be useless, nor too verbose to be unintelligible, but is useful to all, especially the spiritual aspirants.\nExplore Brahma Sutra verses in Sanskrit, along with its Gujarati translation and Shri Yogeshwarji’s commentary."", 'Indian Buddhism by A.

Similarly, borage herb contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids that are hepatotoxic and can damage the liver. Both substances can affect liver enzyme levels - particularly AST and ALT, which are the most frequently measured enzymes for detecting liver damage. Normal AST levels should be 5-40 units/L and ALT 7-56 units/L. When these levels are elevated, it can indicate liver cell damage. Healthcare professionals should monitor patients using these substances and advise on potential drug interactions or complications.	['Borago officinalis, commonly known as borage or starflower, is one of a host of herbs with origins in the Mediterranean region.\nNaturalized in the United States, it grows in a wild and weedy fashion, sporting its signature blue star blossoms as well as fuzzy leaves, stems, and drooping buds.\nIn addition to the botanical species, there are cultivated varieties available in both blue and white.\nWe link to vendors to help you find relevant products. If you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission.\nIn this article, I’ll cover how to cultivate borage, a versatile herb that may be grown as an ornamental, an ingredient for herbal and culinary use, or as a cover crop.\nWhat You’ll Learn\nNote that its fuzzy texture may cause a skin reaction in sensitive people. If you are prone to allergies, wear gloves when you handle it.\nCultivation and History\nAccording to experts at the Flower Essence Society, B. officinalis likely originated in Syria. Today it is naturalized throughout Europe and the United States.\nThere are two literary references from the 1500s to an herb believed to be borage: there is a forgetfulness-inducing herb in Homer’s Odyssey, and a mood elevator in Dioscorides’ De Materia Medica.\nThe leaves and flowers have long been used in the eastern Mediterranean region as potherbs and drink garnishes.\nThey also have a history of use in herbal remedies to address conditions ranging from respiratory issues to adrenal problems.\nThe leaves have an aroma reminiscent of cucumber, and a rather salty flavor. The flowers are sweet, like honey.\nThe seeds contain an oil prized for its high gamma linoleic acid (GLA) content.\nThis fatty acid is believed to be antigenotoxic and anti-inflammatory. Today it is sold as a health supplement.\nHowever, please note: in addition to being a potential skin irritant, consumption of this herb may cause adverse reactions.\nBorage contains low concentrations of unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids that are hepatotoxic, or potentially damaging to the liver.\nIf you have a medical condition, please consult a physician or other healthcare professional before consumption, to avoid drug interactions.\nAlthough each stunning flower blooms for only a day, starry B.officinalis opens continually during the summer months, making it a rich nectar and pollen source for honeybees.\nTo encourage optimal flower production, deadhead spent blooms frequently, or harvest them fresh for use as a garnish in salads or drinks.\nAn annual by definition, B. officinalis behaves like a perennial. It is a self-sower that ensures its future by dropping seeds at season’s end that germinate the following spring.\nIdeal conditions for cultivation include a full sun to part shade location and average, well-draining soil.\nMature dimensions may reach three feet tall and up to 18 inches wide.\nThe best way to start growing B. oficinalis is from seed. Seeds have a high germination rate, and sowing them couldn’t be easier.\nSelf-sowing at season’s end ensures that a one-time seed investment repays the grower for years to come.\nIt’s easy to start new plants from seed by direct sowing outdoors in spring after the last average frost date has passed.\nAlternatively, you can start seeds indoors a month before the last frost date and transplant seedlings to the garden.\nHow to Grow\nThis is an herb that delivers dynamic growth when you offer ideal conditions.\nProvide a location with full sun. Plants tolerate part shade, but may not produce as many flowers without an abundance of sunshine.\nThe soil may be average, provided it drains well.\nTo improve the drainage of compact, clay-like soil, amend it with organically-rich material like leaf mulch or compost, as well as ordinary builder’s sand. Note that the addition of organic matter may slightly increase soil acidity.\nThe ideal soil pH is between 4.8 and 8.3. This is a wide range, and it’s very likely that your soil is within bounds.\nWork the soil to a depth of 10 to 12 inches, until it is crumbly.\nSow seeds 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep.\nMaintain even moisture during germination and while plants are becoming established.\nOnce it is established in the garden, you may let the soil dry out between waterings. This species has above average drought tolerance.\nYou can apply a layer of mulch to aid in water retention and inhibit the growth of weeds.\nHerbs also make great container plants. Select a pot that is at least 12 inches wide and deep to accommodate root spread and mature dimensions.\nBe sure it has adequate drainage holes, and fill it with a well-draining potting medium.\nA critical aspect of container gardening is to remember is that pots dry out quicker than ground soil, so be vigilant.\n- Plant in full sun for an abundance of blooms.\n- Average soil is fine, provided it drains well.\n- Amend the soil as needed with compost, leaf mulch, or even builder’s sand to loosen it and improve drainage.\nCultivars to Select\nWhen shopping for seeds, you are likely to come across blue botanical species B. officinalis as well as cultivated varieties in both blue and white.\nBlue species B. officinalis seeds are available from True Leaf Market in 2-gram, 1-ounce, 4-ounce, 1-pound, and 5-pound packages.\nWhite cultivated B. officinalis ‘Alba’ seeds are available from Eden Brothers.\nManaging Pests and Disease\nB. officinalis is not prone to problems with insects or disease. It is valued in the garden because it attracts beneficial insects that feed on many pests, making it a great companion plant.\nHowever, if its growing environment is less than ideal, trouble may arise.\nThe fungal infections most likely to infect plants when conditions are too wet include: leaf spot, powdery mildew, root rot, and stem rot.\nTo avoid leaf spot and powdery mildew, be sure to space plants the recommended nine to 18 inches apart, depending upon their expected mature widths.\nThis helps maintain sufficient air circulation and inhibits the buildup of excess moisture and humidity.\nRoot and stem rot begin in oversaturated soil. Avoidance measures include sowing in soil that drains well, and not overwatering.\nIn the event of a fungal outbreak, remove affected foliage or entire plants and discard them in the trash.\nYou may also apply a food-safe fungicide according to package instructions.\nIt’s unlikely that your plants will be bothered by deer or rabbits, as the aromatic leaves and fuzzy texture don’t seem to appeal to them.\nKeep in mind that the fuzzy texture of borage may cause skin irritation, and consumption may cause adverse reactions.\nTo pick flowers, grasp the brownish center and pull gently to release them from the green calyxes below.\nYou can harvest the leaves when they are smooth young sprouts, as “microgreens,” or at a later stage when they are larger and fuzzier.\nTo harvest the leaves, use your thumb nail to pinch them off at the base.\nB. officinalis is an “indeterminate” grower that may be harvested many times.\nYou may also collect seeds after the flowers have finished blooming.\nWhen a flower is brown and withered, hold a bag beneath it, and rub the dry petals with your thumb and forefinger to release the seeds into the bag.\nStore the seeds in a labeled envelope in a cool, dry place for up to one year to sow next season.\nUse the leaves and flowers when they are fresh, as soon as possible after harvesting.\nAdd a few greens to salads, or to the soup pot.\nOr you can try freezing the flowers in ice cubes for an extra special drink attraction.\nYou can candy the star-like blossoms for decorative cake embellishments.

However, normal reference ranges are routinely provided by each laboratory and printed with each patient’s individual report.\nDon’t Miss: Is Shrimp Bad For Your Cholesterol\nHow Can You Tell If Your Liver Is Enlarged\nA doctor can diagnose an enlarged liver with a physical examination and imaging tests, such as such as CT scan, ultrasound or MRI. The doctor will likely need to order some blood tests to determine what is causing the liver enlargement.\nWhat Foods To Avoid If You Have High Liver Enzymes\n6 foods to avoid if you have a fatty liverAlcohol. Alcohol is a major cause of fatty liver disease as well as other liver diseases.Added sugar. Stay away from sugary foods such as candy, cookies, sodas, and fruit juices. Fried foods. These are high in fat and calories.Salt. White bread, rice, and pasta. Red meat.\nHigh Liver Enzymes & High Blood Sugar\nA simple blood test can check liver enzyme levels. Elevated levels can indicate liver damage; liver function is usually tightly regulated, but a damaged liver can “leak” extra enzymes into the bloodstream because its function is compromised. This liver damage can be acute or chronic. With either type of liver damage, many physiological functions, including blood sugar control, can be affected. It is important to correct the underlying cause of the liver dysfunction to prevent serious, long-term consequences.\nHow Can I Lower My Cholesterol Level\nThe first step in reducing your cholesterol is to maintain a healthy, balanced diet. It’s important to keep your diet low in fatty food.\nYou can swap food containing saturated fat for fruit, vegetables and wholegrain cereals. This will also help;prevent high cholesterol returning.\nOther lifestyle changes, such as;taking regular exercise and;giving up smoking, can also make a big difference in helping to lower your cholesterol.\nIf these measures don’t reduce your cholesterol and you continue to have a high risk of developing heart disease, your GP may prescribe a cholesterol-lowering medication, such as statins.\nYour GP will take into account the risk of any side effects from statins. The benefit of lowering your cholesterol must outweigh any risks.\nRead more about how high cholesterol is treated\nWhat Causes High Cholesterol\nMany factors can increase your chances of having heart problems or a stroke if you have high cholesterol.\n- an unhealthy diet in particular, eating high levels of saturated fat\n- smoking; a chemical called acrolin, found in cigarettes, stops HDL transporting cholesterol from fatty deposits to the liver, leading to narrowing of the arteries\n- having diabetes or high blood pressure\n- having a family history of stroke or heart disease\nThere’s also an inherited condition called familial hypercholesterolaemia. This can cause high cholesterol even in someone who eats healthily.\nRead more about the causes of high cholesterol\nCan Liver Disease Cause High Cholesterol\nThere are many different liver diseases.\nHepatitis, alcohol-related liver disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD are some of the most common liver diseases.\nLiver disease causes damage to the liver, which can mean that it is not able to work as well.\nOne of the functions of the liver is to break down cholesterol. If the liver is not working properly, it can cause cholesterol to build up in the body.\nCommon Medications That Can Cause Liver Damage\nThe best known medication that can damage the liver is acetaminophen, also known as Tylenol®. This medication is widely available without prescription and is present in many of the cold and flu remedies sold in drugstores as well as in prescription pain medications. ;Most pain medications that are labeled as non-aspirin have acetaminophen as its main ingredient.\nAcetaminophen, when used as directed, is extremely safe even for people with liver disease. However, taking too much acetaminophen at once, or taking a high dose of acetaminophen continuously over several days can cause damage to the liver. Healthy individuals should not take more than 1,000 mg of acetaminophen per dose, and should not take more than 4,000mg in one day . In addition, even healthy persons should avoid taking 3,000mg of acetaminophen daily for more than 3 to 5 days. Patients with liver disease should restrict the daily amount of acetaminophen to 2,000mg per day, or even less if severe liver disease is present. Even if you have no liver disease, always use the smallest amount of acetaminophen needed to obtain relief. It is important that you read the labels of all prescription and non-prescription medications that you take. Often acetaminophen may be present in several medications which could cause you to take a dose of acetaminophen that exceeds the safe limits.\nTreating High Cholesterol And Liver Damage\nIn order to treat a liver problem, doctors will first have to identify the underlying condition thats causing it. Liver problems that are due to high cholesterol are actually some of the easiest ones to treat, provided the liver has yet to suffer irreparable damage.\nThe best thing to do is to avoid eating foods that are rich in fats and cholesterol, in order to prevent adding high levels of cholesterol into a body that can already make its own. In order to prevent raising cholesterol levels, a diet rich in fibers, lean meat, fish, brands, nuts, healthy oils, and whole grains is super important.\nIf you observe all the dietary recommendations given to people with high cholesterol, you will notice that they will also help those who have a liver disease: avoiding alcohol consumption, eating a lot of protein-rich foods, but also getting enough exercise.\nHow Can I Lower My Liver Enzymes Fast\nIncreasing fiber intake, reducing saturated fats and processed foods, as well as consuming a range of nutrients from fruits and vegetables may all help to lower levels. People can see their doctor for an ALT test if they notice any symptoms of liver damage to check whether their ALT levels are within the normal range.\nTreatments For High Triglyceride Levels\nIf you have high triglycerides, your doctor’s treatment should include healthy eating and exercise. Avoiding processed and sugary foods is paramount; these dietary changes alone can have a tremendous impact on your triglyceride levels. Your doctor may also recommend taking omega 3 fatty acid supplements.Â;\nBegin today. Talk to your doctor or other health care provider about exactly what you need to do to start living a healthy lifestyle to lower triglycerides, help prevent a heart attack or stroke, avoid or manage diabetes, and reduce your chances of developing liver disease and pancreatitis.\nMost Common Causes Of High Ast/alt\nThere are MANY, MANY conditions and disease states that lead to high AST and ALT but the majority of them can be boiled down to just a few conditions.;\nThis list below is not all encompassing but should give you a good idea on how to get started.;\nEmphasis should be put on #1 and #2 which will most likely account for the vast majority of slight elevations in AST and ALT in most people.;\nThe reason you should focus on these is that they are treatable and reversible.;\n#1. Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease\nThis is by far the #1 cause of elevated AST and ALT in the United States with a prevalence of up to 30%; and it’s primarily caused by insulin resistance and almost entirely preventable!\nHow it happens:\nAs you consume sugary, especially refined sugar, your body rapidly metabolizes glucose into fats or lipids in the liver through a process known as de novo lipogenesis.;\nAs the influx of glucose becomes more than your body is able to handle this fat begins to get stored in the liver.;\nAs fat increases in the liver, it results in damage to the liver cells.;\nThis damage is seen in the serum as an elevation in serum levels of AST and ALT.;\nIf the diet is not changed or if insulin resistance is not managed then this fat accumulation will eventually cause permanent and chronic damage to the liver.;\nThis may result in complete liver failure over time.;\nPeople who have metabolic syndrome and high AST/ALT should be evaluated for diabetes and insulin resistance.;\nTreating NAFLD and High AST/ALT\nGetting A Cholesterol Test\nA blood sample is taken that will be used to determine the amount of bad cholesterol , good cholesterol and;other fatty substances in your blood.\nYou may be asked not to eat for 10-12 hours before the cholesterol test, usually including when you’re asleep at night. This ensures that all food is completely digested and won’t affect the outcome of the test.\nYour GP or practice nurse can carry out the;cholesterol test and will take a blood sample, either using a needle and a syringe or by pricking your finger.\nA newer type of test that measures non-high-density lipoprotein is now sometimes used because it’s thought to be a more accurate way of estimating;cardiovascular disease risk than LDL.\nNon-HDL cholesterol is total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol. It’s also not necessary to fast before the test, so it;is more convenient.\nAlcohol Or Drug Use Disorder\nDrinking too much alcohol or using illicit drugs may lead to liver inflammation or damage.\nLiver inflammation due to alcohol consumption is called alcoholic hepatitis. When drugs are the underlying cause, doctors call it toxic hepatitis.\nThe symptoms of alcoholic and toxic hepatitis are similar to those of other strains of hepatitis.\nIf a person is experiencing symptoms of alcohol or drug use disorder, the doctor may check their liver enzyme levels and offer various forms of treatment and support.\nArticles On High Triglycerides\nWhen your triglyceride levels are too high, you may not have symptoms. It’s a “silent” problem with big implications, such as a four-fold increase in the likelihood of having a heart attack or stroke.\nA simple blood test is all it takes to check your triglyceride levels. If they’re too high, you can get them back under control, often by changing your daily habits.\nIf you already know that your triglyceride levels are too high, the actions you take now might even save your life.\nHealth Conditions That Lead To High Cholesterol\nA number of health conditions can lead to high cholesterol levels, and high cholesterol is a major risk factor for heart disease, including heart attack. Knowing your risk is the first step to prevention.\nHealth conditions known to increase cholesterol levels include:\nThese health conditions raise cholesterol levels for different reasons. First, the levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood essentially reflect the body’s metabolism of the fat that we eat in a day, says Nicholls.\n“Diabetes and thyroid disorders can affect the way we metabolize cholesterol and triglycerides,” which then has a direct effect on triglyceride and cholesterol levels in the blood, he says. So when these conditions slow down metabolism, the body isn’t able to process everything it needs to, including fats and cholesterol.\nIn conditions like alcoholism and liver disease, the liver;is not functioning at full capacity, so it can’t metabolize all of the saturated fat from the diet and the cholesterol that the body produces. Because of this, cholesterol builds up in the blood, Nicholls explains.\nWhat Are Some Of The Less Common Causes Of Elevated Liver Blood And Function Tests\nLess common causes of abnormal liver enzymes in the United States include hemochromatosis , Wilson’s disease, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and autoimmune hepatitis. Though not as common as hepatitis C, hepatitis B can cause chronic liver disease with persistently abnormal liver enzymes.\n- Hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder in which there is excessive absorption of dietary iron leading to accumulation of iron in the liver with resultant inflammation and scarring of the liver. If undiagnosed or untreated, hemochromatosis can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure.\n- Wilson’s disease is an inherited disorder with excessive accumulation of copper in diverse tissues including the liver and the brain. Excess copper in the liver can lead to chronic liver inflammation, while copper in the brain can cause psychiatric and motor disturbances.\n- Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disorder in which the lack of a glycoprotein called alpha-1-antitrypsin lead to chronic lung disease and chronic liver disease.\n- Autoimmune hepatitis results from liver injury brought about by the body’s own antibodies and defense systems attacking the liver.\nNatural Approaches To Lowering Liver Enzymes\nMany liver diseases have no pharmacological treatment, and taking steps to heal the liver naturally is the best option. Lifestyle changes such as following a nutritionally adequate diet, getting enough exercise, avoiding toxins, and maintaining optimum weight may all contribute to liver healing and a normalization of liver enzymes.\nMedicinal Herbs And The Liver\nSome medicinal herbs contain substances that can damage the liver. The liver is a prime target for damage because it processes everything that enters the mouth and is swallowed.\nPyrrolizidine alkaloids: Hundreds of herbs contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which may damage the liver. These herbs include borage, comfrey, and certain Chinese herbs, such as zi cao , kuan dong hua , qian li guang , and pei lan . Some herbs used to make teas contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Sometimes milk, honey, and cereals are contaminated with pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which are then consumed unknowingly.\nPyrrolizidine alkaloids can damage the liver gradually if small amounts are consumed for a long time. Damage can occur more quickly if a large amount is consumed. The hepatic veins may become clogged, blocking blood flow out of the liver.\nAffected people have abdominal pain and may vomit. Fluid accumulates in the abdomen and legs. Eventually, scar tissue in the liver , liver failure, and even death may result.\nOther herbs: Liver damage may also result from herbs such as Atractylis gummifera, Camellia sinensis , celandine , chaparral, Garcinia cambogia , green tea extract , germander, jin bu huan, kava, ma huang , mistletoe, pennyroyal oil , and syo-saiko-to .\nWhy Should I Lower My Cholesterol\nEvidence strongly indicates that high cholesterol can increase the risk of:\n- narrowing of the arteries ;\n- transient ischaemic attack ; often known as a;”mini stroke”\n- peripheral arterial disease\nThis is because cholesterol can build up in the artery wall, restricting the blood flow to your heart, brain and the rest of your body. It also increases the risk of a;blood clot developing somewhere in your body.\nYour risk of;developing coronary heart disease;also rises as your blood’s cholesterol level increases. This can cause;pain in your chest or arm during stress or physical activity;.\nThe Problem With Vegetable Oil\nThe vegetable oil you buy in the supermarket to cook with has usually been through a number of processes that have damaged the beneficial fats once present in the oils, and produced some toxic substances.; Most oils come from seeds, nuts or fruit.\nPolyunsaturated and monounsaturated vegetable oils are quite delicate and unstable.; This means that they are easily damaged and go rancid quickly.; This can make them quite harmful to our health.; Currently most vegetable oils are extracted in factories through the use of heat and chemical solvents.; They are exposed to light and oxygen during processing, which negatively affect the oil.\nIf you cook with these kinds of processed vegetable oils and heat them to high temperatures, you are further destroying them and adding to the quantity of trans fatty acids they already contain. If you eat a lot of damaged, oxidized oils, they will cause your LDL cholesterol molecules to be oxidized. This kind of cholesterol is more likely to accumulate in artery walls and block them. The inflammation generated in your body also raises cholesterol production.\nFunctions Of The Liver\nThe liver is located in the upper right portion of the abdomen, and plays a very important and diverse role in the body. It has many functions, including creating bile to digest fat, regulating blood clotting and blood sugar, and producing and regulating proteins, cholesterol and fat transporters. Additionally, all drugs and chemicals that enter the body are first filtered by the liver; harmful substances are broken down and excreted by the kidneys.\nWhat Should My Cholesterol Levels Be\nBlood cholesterol is measured in units called millimoles per litre of blood, often shortened to mmol/L.\nAs a general guide, total cholesterol levels should be:\n- 5mmol/L or less for healthy adults\n- 4mmol/L or less for those at high risk\nAs a general guide, LDL levels should be:\n- 3mmol/L or less for healthy adults\n- 2mmol/L or less for those at high risk\nAn ideal level of HDL is above 1mmol/L. A lower level of HDL can increase your risk of heart disease.\nYour ratio of total cholesterol to HDL may also be calculated. This is your total cholesterol level divided by your HDL level. Generally, this ratio should be below four, as a higher ratio increases your risk of heart disease.\nCholesterol is only one risk factor. The level at which specific treatment is required will depend on whether other risk factors, such as smoking and high blood pressure, are also present.']	['<urn:uuid:35bb041e-7b56-4dd8-96f8-abff914361ac>', '<urn:uuid:a65aa3c4-1418-4f08-91d9-017ce4b78334>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	11	106	4611
43	What role did water availability play in both military power and disease control?	Water availability was crucial for military power by enabling grass growth that supported the Mongol army's five horses per soldier. Additionally, reliable water supply and proper water storage were essential for controlling various diseases - including waterborne diseases like cholera, water-washed diseases from poor sanitation, and water-related vector diseases spread by mosquitoes breeding in standing water.	"['In the rings of ancient and gnarled trees, scientists have found evidence of a period of an unusual stretch of warmth and wetness in Mongolia between the years 1211 and 1225 — the exact time that Genghis Khan was in power.\nCoincidence? They think not.\nThis unusual period of mild temperatures and unprecedented rain in an area traditionally known for its cold and arid climate would probably have increased the productivity of grasslands of the Mongolian steppe, the researchers say. The abundant grass would in turn increase the number of grazing animals that could live off it.\nMembers of Genghis Khan\'s army reportedly had five horses apiece, which allowed them to swiftly conquer an enormous area that stretched from East Asia to Eastern Europe, as well as parts of northern India and the Middle East. They also needed great herds of livestock to provide them with food.\n""Nature set the table, and Genghis Khan came to eat,"" said Amy Hessl, a tree-ring scientist at West Virginia University. ""The culture and the people capitalized on that.""\nHer colleague Neil Pederson, a research scientist in the Tree Ring Research Laboratory of Columbia University\'s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y., put it this way: ""Grass was the power of the day.""\nThe story of the unusual wet period in Mongolian history was written in scores of ancient Siberian pine trees that Pederson and Hessl first sampled on a whim during a research trip to central Mongolia in 2010. The trees were growing on a nearly soil-less lava field that was dotted with horse skeletons.\n""There were so many that we started calling it \'where horses go to die,\'"" Hessl said.\nBecause the trees in this area are severely water-stressed, they are particularly sensitive to changes in the weather. And because they grow in such an arid and cool environment, even the trunks of dead trees remain well preserved for centuries.\nOn that first trip, the two scientists gathered core samples from about a dozen trees — some living, some dead. When they got them back to the lab, they were surprised to discover that some of those samples came from trees that were alive 1,000 years ago.\nThey also found evidence of a climate narrative they couldn\'t ignore: For a small stretch of time, some of the rings were visibly thicker.\n""At first I was just excited that we had wood from the time of Chinggis Khan,"" said Pederson, using an Asian name for the legendary ruler. ""After you work in Mongolia for a year, you realize how important Chinggis is for the Mongolian people. He is their George Washington — there are TV commercials with him drinking vodka or talking on a cellphone. It\'s 800 years later, and he\'s still everywhere.""\nPederson hadn\'t been looking for any changes in the rings around the time of Genghis Khan\'s reign. But they were impossible to ignore.\n""It was really the trees saying, \'Look how wide our rings are right here,\'"" he said.\nPederson and Hessl returned to the same site two years later to gather more samples — cutting cross-sections of dead trees that had already fallen over and taking thin, pencil-sized cores from trees that were still alive. Those samples confirmed the initial findings: The expansion of the Mongolian empire coincided with an unusually warm and wet climate.\nThe pair published their findings this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.\nJack Weatherford, author of ""Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World,"" said that although the findings are intriguing, he is not convinced they had much to do with Genghis Khan\'s ascent to power.\n""I am always delighted when we have more information about the Mongol empire, but I am skeptical of any single variable as the explanation for the Mongol rise,"" said Weatherford, an anthropology professor at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn., who is now retired and living in Mongolia.\n""Genghis Khan\'s army was approximately 100,000; yet he conquered most of China, which had possibly a million soldiers as well as millions of other people,"" Weatherford said. ""What role did rain or drought have in that conquest? The connection seems tenuous.""\nHe also wondered why the extra rainfall would have helped Genghis Khan but not his Chinese adversaries or the other tribes in Mongolia at the time, like the Kereyid, Naiman and Tartars.\nTo address questions like this, Pederson and Hessl have partnered with experts in other disciplines to help paint a fuller portrait of the environment in which Genghis Khan\'s empire began and how that might have contributed to his military success.\nAvery Cook Shinneman, a biologist who was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Washington, will analyze Mongolian lake sediment to see if the quantity of fungal spores that grow in animal dung corresponds with a larger population of horses and livestock at the time. Hanqin Tian, an ecologist at Auburn University who studies modern grasslands, will create a model to illustrate how grass production on the steppe would be influenced by the climate recorded in the trees. And historian Nicola Di Cosmo at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., will consider how this climate information fits in with what is known of the time.\nAlready, Di Cosmo said, the tree-ring research is helping to debunk the theory that drought conditions drove the Mongols to leave the steppe in search of more fertile lands. The tree rings suggest that during times of drought, the Mongol tribes were too busy to build an empire because they were fighting among themselves over scarce resources. A more likely scenario is that a warm and wet climate allowed Genghis Khan to centralize power in one part of the steppe and support all the people who lived there.\nBut to say anything definitive, much more research needs to be done.\n""The tree-ring research is interesting, and if we can get more data from other parts of the country and a clearer map of climate at the time, I would feel on safer ground,"" said Di Cosmo, who contributed to the Hessl-Pederson study. ""But if you want to learn about these people who have very little written history, we have to put together these scraps of information wherever we can get them.""', 'Skip to 0 minutes and 4 seconds When we talk about diseases, related to the water cycle, they are generally divided into four different categories, waterborne, water washed, water-based, and water related vector diseases. Waterborne diseases, such as cholera and typhoid, occur when water is contaminated by an infective agent, as shown in this picture. What we mean by an infective agent, in this case, are micro organisms, including viruses, bacteria, and protozoa. A key aspect to this type of disease is that no development of the organism takes place within the water until the organism is ingested by a human. This provides the perfect conditions for the organism to multiply rapidly again, thus causing the illness.\nSkip to 0 minutes and 45 seconds These disease causing organisms are contained in the faeces of infected people, and so are strongly associated with poor sanitation. So to control against these diseases, the challenge is to improve sanitation, and improve the quality of water. Cholera, for example, a major public health problem in many countries, is caused by a rod shaped bacterium. There have been several epidemics that have been spread through many countries over the past 30 years. For example, in 2015, there were over 172,000 reported cases worldwide. Other examples of such waterborne diseases include polio, giardia, amoebic dysentery, and hepatitis A and E. Water washed diseases, on the hand, are directly related to poor sanitation, lack of personal hygiene, and a lack of water or washing facilities.\nSkip to 1 minute and 29 seconds These diseases include trachoma, typhus, and ascariasis. Trachoma is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium that affects the eyes, leads to pain and breakdown of the outer surface or cornea, and eventual blindness if not treated. The bacteria can be spread by both direct and indirect contact with an infected person. In contrast, ascariasis is caused by a roundworm that infects people who eat food or drink water contaminated with ascaris eggs contained in faeces from infected people.\nSkip to 1 minute and 59 seconds The worm has a fairly complicated life cycle inside the body, whereby the eggs hatch in the gut, and then burrow through the gut wall to migrate to the lungs, where they break into the alveoli and pass up the throat, where they’re then coughed up and swallowed. The larvae then passed through to the stomach for the second time and into the intestine, where they become adult worms. A third type of disease, that occurs in the water cycle, are water-based disease. These are caused by parasites, who enters a host who has contacts with water. Water is therefore an integral part of the life cycle of the parasite. These parasites include Guinea worm and bilhazia.\nSkip to 2 minutes and 33 seconds The host animal then perpetuates the cycle by contaminating water with urine and faeces. The control measures for preventing these types of diseases are to improve sanitation, reduce contact with infested water, and to protect the water supply. This slide shows the life cycle of schistosomiasis parasites that causes bilharzia, as an example. The parasite flatworm breaks through the skin and then heads through the blood to the lungs, where it develops further before heading to liver, where it feeds on the red blood cells. Eventually, it gets to the kidneys and the bladder, where it is excreted in urine and faeces.\nSkip to 3 minutes and 6 seconds Finally, there are water related infected diseases which require a vector, typically a mosquito, that carries or transmits a disease pathogen and undergoes part of its life cycle in water. Examples of water related infected diseases include dengue fever, yellow fever, Onchocerciasis which is river blindness, and malaria. In 2015, there were estimated 212 million cases of malaria and 429,000 deaths, causing massive amounts of health care costs and human suffering. Malaria is caused by a protozoa, which is carried by the female anophelene mosquito, which breeds in clean standing water. Dengue fever, meanwhile, is caused by a virus, which is caused by the aedes mosquito, which likes to breed in water storage containers.\nSkip to 3 minutes and 49 seconds Other mosquitoes, such as the culex mosquito, that carries disease that causes the swelling of the lymph system, known as elephantiasis, breed in dirty stagnant pools. Hence, in order to control these types of diseases, it is necessary to maintain a reliable water supply, improve water storage, carefully dispose of sullied water, and improve drainage. So having looked at the different diseases caused by poor sanitation and water supply, how can we best prevent infectious diseases? How can we reach Goal 6, and what is its impact on public health, the environment, and society?\nSkip to 4 minutes and 20 seconds This clearly requires an understanding of how such pathogens are spread from infected humans into the local environment from where they can then re-inject individuals, as has been shown in this video. In most cases, the key actions need to prevent the organism from infected individuals being able to spread directly or indirectly, which means the provision of effective sanitation systems. Equally, water sources need to be protected from the pollution of such organisms. And finally, hygiene education needs to be promoted such that people understand the importance of using sanitation facilities, accessing clean water, and responsible use and storage of water in the home. If all three areas are tackled at the same time, then the aims of Goal 6 can be realised.\nSkip to 5 minutes and 0 seconds We will be looking at each of these preventative measures in the next steps, by looking at different technologies that are available to tackle these objectives, and then considering some case studies in both rural settings and urban environments in Ireland, Africa, and India.\nWater and sanitation related diseases\nAs we saw in the video, there are four different categories of diseases related to poor sanitation and water supply.\n- Waterborne diseases (e.g. cholera and typhoid)\n- Water-washed diseases (e.g. trachoma, typhus, and ascariasis)\n- Water-based diseases (e.g. bilharzia)\n- Water related vector diseases (e.g. dengue fever and yellow fever)\nWe will look at preventative measures used to fight these diseases, such as the following:\n- Protecting water sources from dangerous organisms\n- Developing effective sanitation systems\n- Promoting hygiene education\nThinking about the country you live in:\n- Are water based diseases common in your country?\n- Why/why not?\n- Think about any changes in your country over time that helped protect against these types of diseases.\n© Trinity College Dublin']"	['<urn:uuid:e1f3d83e-173a-4367-a637-be3eec89b84e>', '<urn:uuid:9dc39c1f-2bbe-498b-8be3-145a0855986b>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	13	56	2144
44	How much money was raised in the Chennai flood fundraiser concert?	A fundraiser concert organized by Archith and his brother Ashwin raised $9,000 for Chennai flood relief.	['Spotlight: From Techie to Broadcast Journalist\n(Left) Archith Seshadri: cut out to be a broadcast journalist!\nTwelve years ago, as he tested circuit breakers in a Siemens lab, ARCHITH SESHADRI would have never imagined that he would work in broadcast news—in India. But today he finds himself in New Delhi at the headquarters of Zee Media Group’s first English news network, WION (World Is One News).\nA Georgia Tech graduate, with a six-year stint at Accenture, Archith redefined himself when he realised that his heart wasn’t in computers and coding. Instead, he wanted to meet people and tell stories.\n(Right) The young TV reporter in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nIn the five years that followed, he reported and anchored from television stations across the South including in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Augusta and Macon, Georgia. In the course of this work, he trained with U.S. marines from Parris Island, South Carolina, reported from Atlanta on the Ebola outbreak, and travelled to Washington, D.C. for National Police Week. At the international desk in CNN International, prior to joining WION, Archith assisted with the coverage of the Paris and Brussels terror attacks, the MetroJet plane crash in Egypt, and the church shootings in Charleston, South Carolina.\nBut it was the December 2015 flood in the city of Chennai, India, which became a turning point. Moved by the devastation of their home town, Archith and his brother Ashwin did a fundraiser concert and raised $9,000. Archith took time off work to go volunteer in Chennai, but he went with a mission: he wanted to help but he also wanted to tell the stories of the countless people whose lives had been altered by the floods. Thanks to his knowledge of Tamil, he spoke to people whose homes and businesses had been destroyed and whose livelihoods had been lost. He spoke to families who had been moved to makeshift shelters and the locals who were collecting food packets for the needy.\nIt was a pivotal moment in Archith’s life when he realized the sheer volume of stories that go unreported, simply because reporters don’t go there. And so he seized the opportunity when he was offered the job as a news anchor at WION, a place where he felt his American journalistic experience combined with his Indian roots would help him report on global news with a South Asian worldview. Towards that end, he was recently in New York covering the U.S. election results, and then in Tamil Nadu, India, for the death of Chief Minister Jayalalitha.\nFor someone who has learned to shoot, edit, produce and write news stories only a few years ago, this has been a remarkable learning curve and one can only wonder if it’s his sheer grit and determination, or his networking skills, or a little bit of “pure luck,” or a combination of all of those, that helped him carve a path for himself all the way from that Siemens lab in Atlanta to the WION newsroom, in New Delhi, India.\nYour career trajectory from IT to broadcast\njournalism is quite exceptional. Even in\nmedia, the leaps from small-town Georgia to\nCNN International and now to WION, in New\nDelhi, make it appear as if you are able\nto make desired transitions at will. To\nwhat do you attribute this success?\nI have been fascinated with television ever since I was 7-8 years old. I think that’s where my drive for journalism comes from. However, studying engineering was a natural trajectory, because, like most Indian-Americans, I was good at math and science. It was my safety cushion! But even when I was studying at Georgia Tech, I was writing for the school paper. We had done some events and a charity fundraiser, and I reached out to Khabar. In fact, that’s how I tried my hand at print journalism, writing for Khabar. So you see, journalism was like a little lightbulb, always there, just that it was never switched on.\nBut it was when I did my internship at Siemens in 2004 that I realised that sitting at a desk behind a computer wasn’t for me. I need to be out there interacting with people. Around the same time I started working at Accenture and exploring journalism. There was a time during my Accenture years when I was interning at CNN’s science and technology unit, and doing grad school all in one go. I really enjoyed my time at Accenture, but there came a point when I had to decide if this is something I would like to do for the rest of my life, and that’s when I decided that if I had to do journalism, now was the time.\nThe one common binding element in everything that I have done so far is the passion and the drive for it. If you want to accomplish something, then you alone can do it. You can’t sit around wishing for things to happen. You’ve got to start something, and hopefully, each thing will, sort of like a domino, lead to something else.\nAlso, I think, living in the United States, you can evolve and create whatever you want. You can take everything that you’ve learned and apply it to something completely different. That’s the luxury that America gives you.\nHave all your career moves come about as a matter\nof proactive choice of the next thing you want, or\nhave they been unforeseen breaks due to your excellent\nYou know, someone once told me that it’s not “what” you know, it’s not “who” you know, but “who knows you” that matters, and that really has been my guiding principle. Networking is so essential. I don’t know how you would succeed if you don’t have networking skills. Networking is not about getting someone to help you get a job but it’s strategically finding out how you can help each other, throwing out ideas, and having a conversation.\nPeople think of networking negatively, but I think it’s about building and maintaining quality relationships with people. Most, if not all, of my career moves have been in part due to some level of networking. Networking opens the door for you. You ultimately have to be able to sell yourself. But networking, for anybody, in any industry, is such an important element. In fact, I have a little personal mantra when I go to a conference or a meeting: I make it a point to meet at least one person a day and it doesn’t have to be a CEO or President of a company. It could be someone starting their career, whom you could advise or who could connect you with someone in a new city. It goes back and forth.\nI also think networking is just being proactive. At CNN, once I settled in, I set up coffee meetings with different people every week. When I had those informal chats, I would ask, “Hey, this is what I’ve done, my goal is always to be a correspondent, how can I do that?” They may not have had an answer but it is possible that they could connect you with somebody who does.\nI don’t think you can ever network too much. If I didn’t network I wouldn’t have this job. There are some people who say, “Don’t network, focus on your job!” Well, absolutely, you should focus on your job, you should do your job and do it well. But at the same time nobody’s going to care about your career like you. You don’t lose anything by asking or reaching out or taking the initiative.\nPeople call me ‘the networker,’ but everybody can do it. Everybody should do it, do it well and do it both ways––network to your own benefit, learn, and also connect other people in your network. That’s the key to being somebody who’s always plugged in.\n(Left) In his current role – for World Is One News, Zee News’ first English news network.\nHow did you land the WION position?\nI have always wanted to do international journalism. I lived in Germany for about a year when I was young, grew up in India, then lived in Australia, and finally moved to the US. That’s why I have always had that appreciation for international stories.\nThen in December 2015 the Chennai floods happened. That was an eye-opening experience for me. Of course, I had seen videos and images of the devastation in the city, but physically going to those areas and seeing how bad things were, literally took my breath away. Walking through the footsteps of the people affected by the floods only further strengthened my resolve to step out of my comfort zone and do journalism in India. This was also the time that the international desk at CNN was undergoing major reorganization and everyone was looking for new opportunities. So, when I heard through a colleague that Zee is launching a new channel, I jumped at the opportunity. And that’s how WION happened. But this goes back to networking and being connected to people: if my colleague hadn’t been aware of my goals of being an on-air reporter, she wouldn’t have been able to point me in the right direction.\nWhat have been the major\nchallenges in your career so\nfar and how did you deal with\nOne of the bigger challenges has been to deal with public criticism of the media and what we do. Especially when you are in a field like this, people get to critique and judge your work. Most professionals do not hear that kind of backlash. In many ways, I believe, we are like artists. Every day we paint a picture and put it out for the world to view. Some people may love it and some may not. But learning to deal with that criticism and building a thick skin is such an essential part of this job, because the media’s an easy scapegoat, right?\nAnother challenge is being away from family and friends. I think in this industry, in media, especially in news, you have to love your job. This is not your typical 9 to 5 job. You have to work weekends, holidays, and go where the story is. I am very close to my family and friends and it’s hard sometimes. But thankfully, technology, such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Facetime, lets you live like you’re connected—but even then it is still not easy.\n(Left) Interviewing actress Vidya Balan.\nWhere do you see yourself in the long term?\nWhat are your ultimate career goals and ambitions? If you had asked me 5-10 years ago, I would have never picked this one. I don’t have an absolute answer, but because I like setting goals, I will say that I definitely want to be in the industry in some capacity whether it’s on-air or management or even as an agent helping connect people, using my life experiences of networking and journalism. Ideally I would like to have a show of my own like that of Sanjay Gupta or Fareed Zakaria. There aren’t that many primetime global anchors of Indian or Asian-American descent, and I think that would be a wonderful thing to aspire for. But again, you never know what’s going to happen. Reporting, anchoring, just being out there and telling stories is something I always will aspire to getting better and better at. That’s the plan for right now.\nIn today’s world, people get news not just from\nTV but from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and all\nkinds of social media. Do you think any person, not\njust journalists, can be relevant and effective without\na social media presence?\nI don’t think so. People could still have an impact but they could be much, much more effective with social media. Recruiters in any industry first look you up on social media now. So, it is important to have that digital presence and showcase a positive image for the world. Moreover, most people are on social media now and that’s how they consume their news. So you need to be on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat, to reach those audiences, whether it’s the millennials or others.\nEach platform has its own specialties. Instagram is solely pictures, “worth a thousand words.” Facebook is where you can comment, like a live blog. Twitter is short and sweet, gives you the gist of what happened in 140 characters. I’m on all of them, so even when I’m in the newsroom anchoring, I’m trying to juggle and process and also deliver information. But I also think it’s a Catch-22. As someone at CNN told me, “You will never be fired for not tweeting, but you will definitely be fired for tweeting incorrectly.” So, you have to use social media wisely to build your brand.\nSocial media has also encouraged trends such as citizen journalism. It helps keep people accountable, whether it is politicians who are backtracking on their promises or airlines that are taking advantage of their customers. It is also a great tool for communication. For example, during the Chennai floods people used social media to help each other out. They shared information about food delivery stations and times. The Facebook safety check feature is another example of how people are now communicating during times of duress.\nIncreasingly you see a trend towards opinionated\njournalism and in the ratings game it’s these\noutlets that seem to be doing well. So, clearly the\naudience doesn’t want to hear the “other side.”\nWhat’s your take on that? Should journalists have\nThat’s a great question. I don’t think we should always drive our content based on what the audience wants to hear. That’s not our job. Shows like American Idol get far more ratings than any news show, but that doesn’t mean we become a reality show. Our job is to give people the news and they can decide how they want to use it. It is important to have that sense of neutrality and objectivity on air. Imagine in a newsroom, if there are 10-15 anchors, and if each one of them has an opinion that they are going to articulate every hour, then the tone of the same story will change with each passing hour. I don’t understand how that adds value for the viewers. It would be appropriate, if you see a groundswell of opinion on a particular issue, to call the experts and have them weigh in on it. Your job is to state the facts, ask the questions, and hold people accountable. Your opinion is yours, and no one really should care about it but yourself.\nPlease talk about the similarities and differences\nin your work environment between the U.S.\nThere are plenty of similarities but also some striking differences. There’s a lot of chaos in all newsrooms, even across different countries, because news is always happening and there are so many elements that you have to gather continuously. And in all newsrooms there is workplace politics. You learn to deal with it. In a newsroom, everybody wants the lead story, everybody wants to be deployed, and you see a lot of backstabbing and sabotaging.\nOne striking difference I see here in India is the hours. People in India definitely work more hours, and there is an expectation to work longer hours than your typical nine-hour day. In the U.S., you work your shift and then you’re done, and then the next shift comes in. Or if you are off, you call a freelancer in. But in India, people work longer hours, 12-13-hour shifts, weekends, and you also have to factor in commute time and traffic. Luckily, I live near work, but for a lot of people, it’s an exhausting day.\nFor the most part I feel that I have adjusted well. It’s not that different. A newsroom is a newsroom. A job is a job. It comes with pluses and minuses, and it’s how you learn to deal with it that matters. Communicate well, be a problem-solver, work with your teammates, and understand the social dynamics. That is the best you can do.\nWhat have you learned about India that you\nwouldn’t have if not for living and working there?\nIndian Standard Time is real! And it’s sad and awful. Somebody has said that to be early is to be on time, to be on time is to be late, and to be late is unacceptable. Here people are always late and they act as if it is normal, and I think we should be mindful that we don’t create that culture.\nIs there anything else in particular that you\nwould like to add?\nThe most important thing is to “be nice.” No matter what you have—power, looks, fame, status, money— if you aren’t nice, it doesn’t matter. That being said, you have to be proactive and network. Remember, “it’s not the grades you make but the hands you shake!” And “it’s not what you know, or who you know, but who knows you!”\nDeepa Agarwal is part of a Peabody Award winning team at CNN International, where she is a freelance planning and editorial producer, and was formerly a full time editorial producer.\nEnjoyed reading Khabar magazine?

45	im struggling to learn spanish as my second language want to know difference physical brain process between child adult language learning and location sound perception	Children acquire second languages naturally through exposure, developing native-like fluency without formal teaching. In contrast, adults experience a more deliberate, intellectual, and challenging process that rarely achieves complete native-like fluency, especially in pronunciation. This relates to how our brains process sounds - we need both the physical reception of sound waves through our ears and cognitive processing in the brain to interpret meaning. The brain's ability to naturally acquire language diminishes significantly around puberty, which is why adults must make more conscious efforts to learn.	['Sounds, Location and Perception\nWhat is a Sound?\nReading various writers on the subject of sounds and their identity, I note what appears to be a level of confusion about what we mean by the word ‘Sound’. What is a sound? Where is a sound? What is it’s ontological status? The various writers (See bibliography below but a very good introductory essay can be found at : http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sounds/) speak of four main theories: The Proximal theory – that sounds are where we are, the Medial Theory; that the sounds are in the medium (air usually), the Distal Theory; that sounds are at the site of their generation and finally an Aspatial Theory, that space is not relevant to sound.\nWhat is bothering me is the lack of a human dimension in the discourse. I don’t think it is necessary to complete a theory about things apart from persons. It is too remote from us to have the relevance which the topic demands and all talk of sound is predicated on a human auditor. We want to know what these things are in relation to ourselves. To discourse on trees falling in forests (which is the unstated question that lies behind all thoughts about the ontology of sounds) is too abstract to be of use. I take a general philosophical stance that things signify in relation to the entity to whom they have significance. In short, ourselves. ( I call this Robust Pragmatism informed by Naivety – though I would welcome a professional philosopher’s comments to help make this work out more rigorously). I’m happy to call upon support from such a professional:\n‘…sounds directly perceived are sensations of some sort produced in the observer when the sound waves strike the ear. (Maclaclan, 1989)\nI want to say that a sound is only a sound when experienced by an auditor who has the apparatus to detect it and the intellect to interpret the incoming waves in a consistent manner. If we consider sounds to be just waves in the air of between 20hz and 20Khz (an ambitious range for the over twenties in reality) then what of waveforms that lie above and below? Are they still to be called ‘sounds?’ There is also an implicit duration assumption of there being a repetition of the alternating compression and rarefaction of the air – were it to happen just once, might we not really hear a sound? To paint an extreme picture – consider going up a mountain in a car until your ears pop then down the other side. Technically you have just experienced an ultra-low frequency (one cycle per half hour say – 0.00055 Hz) of one rarefaction followed by one compression (on top of many other wave events) – could we justifiably (and according so some theories is might be so) be said to have ‘heard’ a sound at this frequency?\nI want also to say that a sound contains information that has meaning to the receiver. Let me start with cats or some simple animal – the information it receives may only be fight or flight, come for food etc., but it is a sound to the cat – because it elicits a response that is causally linked to the wave stimulation is reveives. I know that sometimes the cat appears not to hear (but that’s between me and my cat). What can we really know of an animal’s experience of sound other than its response or lack of it. If I communicate with a friend and process my words electronically to be in the 40Khz to 60Khz range they will not hear it. Can I be said fairly to have communicated simply because I created a wave in the air? I would suggest not.\nSome writers have spoken about the objects vibrating and still ‘sounding’ even if in vacuum. I would contend that I could still ‘hear’ a sound in a vacuum if – for example – I were bounce a laser beam from it’s surface and create a sound from the reflection – it is still a transmission of a wave using only a bit of translation equipment – just like the air waves translated by the ears.\nLocation of a sound\nMuch gets written about the location of a sound. Where is this sound in relation to us? Bear in mind; the locational information about the source of the sound if not encoded in the waves of energy being emitted by the object. The source knows nothing of the space in which it takes place and yet writers speak as if it did. As if the information about its location were part of the wave. Let’s go on a journey with a wave:\n1 A sound is generated. Let’s keep it as simple as a finger snap. (The reason for this is that it is a point source – I could enlarge for many pages on the problems of musical instruments that are rarely point-sources but a complex array of sources). There is a sphere of sound waves (pulses of rarefaction and compression ) radiating from the source at a speed of about 350 m/s – not forgetting that this is a approximate number depending on air composition and density, pressure and temperature plus other subtle factors. As soon as the wave has travelled an infinitesimally small distance it will have changed – albeit undetectably at this point but; it will have been subject to the air’s variable elasticity and have been modified in tone and volume in a Nano- second. This process of tonal and volume change over distance is continuous right to the point of audition in the ear drum at which point these factors cease to change. If we go too far away from the sound source then the energy of the waves (spreading and diminishing according to the inverse square law) reduces to Brownian motion in the air and is therefore as undetectable and lost as a homeopathic remedy.\n2 The sound travels in air, constantly transforming and can be said to be accruing information as it travels. It does not know how far it needs to go to meet an auditor but it collects tonal transformation and volume modification as it goes. Within a very short time it will also encounter a surface – often the floor or ceiling first but as soon as it does so, it generates a reflection of itself (losing a tiny bit of energy to the wall in the process). Another part of the expanding sphere of sound waves will encounter another surface – possible a wall and another reflection will be created and so on until all the primary surfaces have been encountered. By the time the furthest surface has been met secondary reflections from the first surfaces will be following the main sound and will also be travelling to the next surface they encounter and so on. We soon get to tertiary and quaternary layers until we end up with something we clearly call reverb. (I will leave the special case of echo aside for now but the keen reader can quickly fish out some determining factors and add them to this account as well as commentary on early reflections) The totality of reflections and complexities of the wave being added to also gives us information about the building it is in. To a musician, nothing describes a building as accurately as the sound it makes. But the sound still has no regard for the listener who may interpose her ears at any point or time in this journey but it is still accruing information as to the distance from its source and the surfaces it has encountered.\n3 Finally it will encounter the listening body but let me start with a simplified case of a single monophonic microphone which will be a dumb witness to the sound as it arrives. The apparatus will record the energy-impeded and tonally modified sound and from that a later auditor to the recording might infer some things about its genesis (such as what sort of object made the sound and how it was excited etc.) but certainly not whence it came. At best they might name the source to the extent of being able to repeat the sound. ‘It’s a finger snap.’ But the sound at this point has also accrued its multiple reflections, and the characteristics of these might lead an auditor to make some assumptions based on their experience of listening and their experience of spaces. They might quickly know that it was recorded in a church or a studio or a domestic environment. In a special set of circumstances (a trained engineer working with established recording venues) might be able to name the space – ‘That’s St. Paul’s Cathedral’ – or ‘that was recorded in Air Studio’.\nI won’t go into other philosophical inferences that can be made from the sound such as it was a person with a hand and fingers and that there was intent – such inferences to back to the big bang (and beyond! I hear a philosopher want to rush in and fill our existential vacuum).\nLet me add a second microphone to the set up so that we can consider direction of the sound through use of stereo recording (remember at all times that ‘stereo’ just means ‘solid’ but we will proceed with the standard assumptions about what the word means). If we are to set up a stereo pair however, how will we orientate it? An engineer will have set it up to be more or less tangential to the circle of sound waves arising – i.e. by pointing the microphones in the general direction of the sound source – so they will be adding information to the recorded sound by this simple act (but not to the sound in the room, of course). A true recording of the source might be better if it were made without regard for this and simply picked up – in stereo, what happened in the room. But this leads to difficulties. In some orientations it will not yeild directional information easily – such as side-on to the source.\nThis ‘adding information’ to the sound is either witting or unwitting and is manifest in a vast array of interlacing frequencies and amplitudes that in theory could be reduced to sine waves (but which never seems to work very well when synthesising sounds – we are seldom fooled).\nHere though, we have a clue as to what sound and location is all about. The act of placing a stereo microphone reveals that the information added by the selection of its location and its orientation is exactly what we as the listener might do when we go to listen to something.\nOur left and right ears intercept the sound wave and ‘hear’ what is going on. It is only at the point when the sound wave reaches the outer ear that all the location information is added. The stereo microphone, correctly aligned, will have picked up a couple of important clues as to location – the interaural level difference (ILD) which is the difference in volume between left and right ears will be captured more or less faithfully by a correctly rigged microphone pair. The interaural time difference (ITD) will also be captured (the difference in arrival time to the two ears is an important directional clue but a moments reflection will show that ITD and ILD are not sufficient to tell front from back – still less about up and down. ITD and ILD give as much radial information as can be captured in a microphone.\nNote that it is only possible to speak of these things at the microphone. In the air in front of the microphone – it is the presence of the equipment and its orientation that creates the point of measurement.\n4 The microphones have still not captured the full spatial location however. They will give us clues as to right and left and the sound itself will capture distance information but now we have to look at the function of the ears and the head. The ears and head form a complex system and these have been measured and calibrated to understand the function of all the parts of that system. The spatial information we depend on to locate sounds in space is a combination of the distance and direction information that is a variable at the microphone but the physical structure and orientation of the head now adds its own information about where we are in relation to the sound source. Each part of the ear modifies the sound in tiny subtle ways which are individual to each of us – we all learned how to use the shape of ear and head we were born with to translate information about sound and their location. (but note how a new born child rotates its head to learn the link between the two)\nHead Related Transfer Functions (HRTF) tell us how the head itself and its orientation affects how we hear. The trouble is our unique personal HRTF that cannot be codified into a recording – though there are some generic data sets that might be applied to a recording to recreate a sense of location.\n5 We move our heads. When listening we ‘cock an ear’ as it were. By moving our heads we add to the information layer and include more about phase relationships in the sound (not dealt with here but again sufficient material for another day), we get to create a small shift in volumes and tones that give us more clues as to location based on our primitive sense of locating danger and we employ all these almost like an analytic instrument to locate the sound.\n6 Brain processing takes place. Bregman’s book on Auditory Scene Analysis is too large to summarise here but it describes and provides analysis on how we sort out incoming data streams in our minds and separate out what belongs in which group of audial experience – hence we can pay attention to one sound sequence whilst another is sounding and we are not confused by a flute melody and simultaneous chatter from a child for example.\nOne can envisage scenarios where all the above criteria are in place but we do not hear the sound as a sound because the cognitive faculties are not correctly align or trained to respond and ‘tell the mind’ that such and such is a sound with content and meaning and that we have to respond to it (even ignoring it is a conscious response to it)\nWhen we talk of what a sound is, I suggest it is the net effect of all the above factors and until it has been interpreted by a conscious entity it is only vibrations in the air with the potential to yield information in the right circumstances.\nTo speak of where a ‘sound’ is located seems like a senseless question unless we recognise that it is only a sound when the brain has processed the incoming impulses from the ear – and it is only an information rich sound to which we can respond when it has been matched with our experience of sounds and we know what it means to us.\nDefining sound as being ‘in the source object’ seems not right because of the transformative journey the waves must take. Vibrations with the capacity to excite a transmission medium, that are shaped by the material of the object might be a start. Medial wave propagation has some useful features as long as we realise and acknowledge that it is a time dependant thing (as is all sound of course). We might take an infinity of time slices to define it (and I don’t have time here for differential calculus but other researchers have) but it seems to me not to be the sound – but an (unreliable!) transmission medium. And the proximal theory leaves us with hearing what is at the ear – but it still needs the intercession of intelligence to make an air vibration – no matter how sophisticated – into a sound that has a meaning.\nI will have to write up all the steps between my assertions and show all my citations (work underway!)\nBut here are a few key sources:\nBlauert, J (1997) Spatial Hearing: The Psychophysics of Human Sound Localization.

Various technologies have been developed to facilitate communication among people all over the world. Globalization has increased demand for second language to enable people realize full benefits from it. It is indisputable that in the new millennium English has become the most demanded international language. The necessity to use English in the modern world is evident everywhere. In various places of the world parents are sending children to bilingual schools or emersion pre-schools to provide them with a head start of learning English language.\n1.2 Childhood Second Language Acquisition\nAcquiring language at a tender age is a natural process which results from prolonged exposure to a certain language. Whereas the written language has to be taught to the children, a spoken one does not need to be taught formally to children. Every kid develops a fluent language if consistent exposure is made within a social setting. In this case, the child is not limited to understanding one language, but may acquire a native fluency in as many languages as he/she is exposed to. However, the natural ability to develop an understanding of a spoken language diminishes sharply as one approaches puberty. Beyond this age, acquiring new language requires deliberate effort. In essence, the exposure to a new language in teenage results in a definite interference with the language or languages learnt earlier.\n1.3 Adulthood Second Language Acquisition\nIn adulthood language acquisition is a learning process. The process is deliberate, intellectual, painful, and hardly leads to a total native-like fluency compared to those who acquire it when young. This deficiency is more evident if learning is made at phonetic level. In this case, the adult who acquires a second language usually speaks it with some non-native accents.\nSecond language acquisition does not necessarily mean acquiring the second language, rather, it means acquiring any other language in addition to the ones already known. The fist language is not a barrier for second language acquisition (Ellis, 1994). This is because children are able to acquire the second, third, or any other number of languages as long as they are exposed to them early enough. Therefore, maturity and age determine the ease of acquiring the second language as opposed to the first language.\n1.4 Learning and Teaching English\nThere are different methods used in teaching. Some of them include use of lectures, brainstorming, panel of experts, class discussion, videotapes, role-playing, and inviting guest speakers among others. Different institutions use different modes of instructions. These modes include: peer teaching, case studies, class instructions, journal articles, and textbooks among others. The mode used depends on the nature of material being taught. Use of peer teaching in second language acquisition has a widespread use.\nThe appropriate teaching technique to be used should depend on student’s learning style for better understanding. Generally, there are three major learning styles. A learning style refers to the preferred method by which an individual learns and remembers what he learnt. One of the learning styles is the visual style. In this case, the learner is able to remember whatever he read or learnt by creating mental pictures of what he experienced. Such individuals learn easily by seeing and their memory is attached to a strong visual association. Use of peer teaching among these learners proves to be very helpful because proper use of demonstrations is made.\nSecondly, there are learners who learn best by listening: auditory learners. They prefer conversations and storytelling, which are possible techniques of peer teaching. The third learning style is the kinesthetic style. Here the learner needs to play and touch whatever they are learning about. The kind of freedom that these learners require may be achieved through peer teaching and hence facilitate the second language acquisition.\n1.5 Statement of the Problem\nAs globalization spreads, interactions among people increase. People require moving across continents and their success in doing so is dependent on the ability to communicate with the natives in every destination. This has led to higher demand for the international languages (Ellis, 1985). It is easier to learn a new language while young but because this is a new phenomenon, we have many adults who need to learn second language. English seems to be the leading language in the current world and many techniques have been developed to teach it to adults. Among them is the peer teaching technique which has gained popularity from its effectiveness in achieving the expected objectives. Although many researches were done regarding peer teaching in linguistic, little is known about the peer teaching benefits and challenges. This study seeks to describe the benefits and challenges experienced in English peer teaching.\n1.6 Significance of the Study\nThe research findings will be availed to different groups of people to facilitate peer teaching. These will include students and teachers in order to discover areas that may require improvement. The institution management may also use the findings when formulating policies.\n1.7 Objective of the study\n1.8 Research questions\nChapter 2: Literature Review\n2.1 General Literature\nAccording to Zander (1974), peer teaching has significant impact on generating teamwork among the students. Students achieve higher motivational levels than they would do if they were studying on their own taught exclusively by a teacher. Denying students a chance to create groups undermines the group efforts and the society loses the benefits that it would get from teamwork.\nAccording to Bruner (1972), the teaching processes benefit both the tutee and the tutor. By allowing the student to pick the teaching role among themselves is giving them new opportunities of acquiring new knowledge (De, 1978). He further explains that peer teaching results to increased self-confidence, increased motivation, better cooperation among students, raises self-esteem, and reduces the destructive competitive behavior among the learners. Piaget (1971) advocates peer teaching as a way of developing active learning for knowledge development.\n2.2 Specific Literature\nBrewster (1984) provided an insight on the benefits that are realized from incorporating peer teaching in institutions. One of the advantages that he discusses relates to the cost of teaching. He asserts that the demand for knowledge such as the second language acquisition, leads to a higher student-teacher ratio (Ortega, 2009). Incorporating peer teaching leads to reduced cost without compromising the learning outcomes. A detailed analysis by Whitman (1988) revealed existence of different groups with different understanding of the subject matter. Such groups are relevant to encourage development of understanding through increased self-esteem. He emphasizes the paramount influence that co-peer teaching has in learning.\nAccording to Selinker and Grass (2001) acquiring second language involves learning a nonnative language. They found out that acquiring new language requires conducive environment with efficient access to fluent speakers of the targeted language. As such, peer tutors with better understanding of the target knowledge are better positioned to help others learn (Krashen, 1982).\n2.3 Conceptual Model\nSecond language acquisition using peer teaching involves a learning process that has to be worked out well. In any case, students must be motivated to appreciate taking the role of teachers. Also, the environment should encourage engagements among the students. Active engagement promotes group formation and hence group learning.\nChapter 3: Research Methodology\n3.1 Research Design\nThe objective of this study is to generate understanding of the challenges faced during peer teaching of English and the benefits realized. This research will use data from primary sources of University of Toronto. It will involve interviewing teachers and student on matters related to learning English as a second language. The interview schedule will be prepared one month before the study and a pre-test will be performed in Ontario Institute for Studies in Education. The pre-test will help evaluate the effectiveness of questionnaire and method of analysis in meeting objectives of the study. The questionnaire will consist of open-ended questions to help probe information from the respondents.\n3.2 Data Collection\nOne hundred people comprising of teachers and student from University of Toronto will be interviewed. The sample is significantly large to reduce the sampling error and allow making non-biased conclusions. The method of simple random sampling will be used. Information received from the respondents will be used to fill the questionnaire. The data will then be coded to facilitate analysis. Similar responses will be given similar codes to use statistical analysis.\n3.3 Data Analysis\nThe quantitative analysis will be appropriate for this study to help generalize the result to the entire population of adults who are striving to acquire their second language in learning institutions. Data analysis tools such as regression will be used to understand relationships and the degree of correlation between the dependent and independent variables.\n3.4 Presentation and Recommendations\nThe collected data will be represented by use of tabular and graphical presentation. This may involve presentation of trends in second language acquisition upon introduction of peer teaching. As such, the finding will be easy to understand and hence useful to the policy makers in institutions that are considering incorporating peer teaching.\n3.5 Ethical Consideration\nThis study will be conducted in accordance to the ethical values of the society. As such, no respondent will be forced to participate in the interview. The interviews will also begin will privacy assurance to create confidence among the respondents. Informed consent will be sought from all respondents.']	['<urn:uuid:b3511650-f674-4bf8-8c68-6f5e0cc4eca0>', '<urn:uuid:90c3743e-e8e3-42bc-9813-be90e012fafc>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	25	85	4381
46	alternative energy sources ethanol production bitcoin mining	Both ethanol production and bitcoin mining are exploring alternative approaches to energy usage. In ethanol production, researchers have developed a fungal process that recycles water and converts waste products, improving energy efficiency and creating valuable by-products like animal feed. For cryptocurrency mining, companies are increasingly turning to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to reduce environmental impact. Some mining companies are also developing energy-efficient mining equipment and implementing proof-of-stake mechanisms that require less energy than traditional proof-of-work systems.	"['A fungus grown in the leftovers of ethanol production could be a good energy feed for pigs and chickens, but also reduce energy costs, a finding at Iowa State University in the US shows.\nIn separate feeding trials piglets and chickens were fed high-protein fungi that Hans van Leeuwen and other ISU researchers have produced in a pilot plant that converts ethanol leftovers into feed-grade fungi.\nIn these feeding trials, researchers have found pig performance wasn\'t impacted when dried fungi were substituted for corn or soybean meal. They are still studying the effects of the feed on amino acid availability, tissue growth, and intestinal health.\nThe production process also cleans some of the water used to produce ethanol, boosting the amount of water that can be recycled back into biofuel production and saving energy on water cleanup and co-product recovery.\nPatent pending process\nThe fungi-production process was developed by a research team led by van Leeuwen, a professor of civil, construction and environmental engineering.\nVan Leeuwen and the research team have been working on their ""MycoMeal"" process for several years. It began as an idea to improve the dry-grind process used to produce ethanol from corn.\nThe process has two patents pending and has won several major awards – most recently it was named the global grand winner of the International Water Association\'s 2012 Project Innovation Awards in Applied Research.\nFor every litre of ethanol produced, there are about five litres of leftovers known as stillage. The stillage contains solids and other organic material. Most of the solids are removed by centrifugation and dried into distillers dried grains.\nThe remaining liquid, known as thin stillage, still contains some solids, a variety of organic compounds and enzymes. Because the compounds and solids can interfere with ethanol production, only about 50% of this thin stillage can be recycled back into biofuel production. The rest is evaporated and blended with distillers dried grains (the solubles).\nQuick growing fungus\nThe Iowa State researchers add a fungus (Rhizopus microsporus) to the thin stillage and it feeds and grows and can be converted into easily harvested pellets in less than a day.\nThe fungus removes about 60% of the organic material and most of the solids, allowing the water and enzymes in the thin stillage to be recycled back into production.\nThe fungus is then harvested and dried for animal feed which is rich in protein, certain essential amino acids, polyunsaturated oils and other nutrients.\nIt can also be blended with DDG to boost its value as a livestock feed and make it more suitable for feeding pigs and chickens.\nVan Leeuwen hopes the fungal product could one day be a low-cost nutritional supplement for people.\nMillion dollars savings\nVan Leeuwen said the production technology can save US ethanol producers up to $800 million a year in energy costs. He also said the technology can produce ethanol co-products worth another $800 million or more per year, depending on how it is used and marketed.\nResearchers have developed a 400-gallon (app. 1,500 litres) pilot plant at the Iowa Energy Center\'s Biomass Energy Conversion facility in Nevada to test and refine the process.\nThey are producing a tonne of the fungi this year for the animal feeding trials, which van Leeuwen said is no minor feat for a pilot plant. There has been some commercial interest in the process, he said.\nThe project has been supported by a three-year $450,000 grant.\nTo comment, login here\nOr register to be able to comment.', 'As the world becomes more conscious of sustainability, the environmental impact of industries and businesses is under the microscope. Cryptocurrency is one of the newer and rapidly evolving industries that has been called out for its high energy consumption and carbon footprint. However, the cryptocurrency sector is also built on innovation, decentralization, and financial democratization. The challenge is to balance these two seemingly opposing goals – sustainability and innovation. In this article, we will explore the environmental concerns of cryptocurrency and ways to mitigate its impact while continuing to promote its benefits.\nRead more: Silvergate Collapse Dragging Down Bitcoin Volume\nCryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses encryption techniques to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds. It is decentralized and operates on a peer-to-peer network that enables secure, fast, and anonymous transactions. Cryptocurrency has gained popularity in recent years, with bitcoin being the most well-known example. However, the process of generating cryptocurrency, known as mining, requires significant computational power, which consumes a massive amount of energy.\nThe amount of energy consumed by cryptocurrency mining has sparked concerns about its environmental impact. According to a 2021 report by the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the annual energy consumption of bitcoin mining alone is estimated to be around 128.84 TWh, which is more than the energy consumption of Argentina. The high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, as the majority of the energy used comes from non-renewable sources like coal and natural gas.\nThe Environmental Impact of Cryptocurrency\nCryptocurrency mining is a highly energy-intensive process that requires specialized computer equipment and software. The process involves solving complex mathematical problems to verify transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. The first miner to solve the puzzle is rewarded with a certain amount of cryptocurrency.\nTo mine cryptocurrency, miners need to use powerful computers, which consume a considerable amount of energy. The energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining is a function of the computing power used and the time it takes to solve the problem. As the difficulty of the problem increases, more computing power is required, which leads to a higher energy consumption.\nThe high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has a significant impact on the environment. Most of the energy used to power cryptocurrency mining comes from non-renewable sources like coal and natural gas. The combustion of fossil fuels leads to the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming and climate change. The increase in greenhouse gas emissions from cryptocurrency mining is a concern as it undermines global efforts to reduce carbon emissions.\nMitigating the Environmental Impact of Cryptocurrency\nThe environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining can be mitigated by adopting sustainable practices. Some of the ways to reduce the energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining are:\nUsing renewable energy sources: One of the most effective ways to reduce the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining is to use renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Some cryptocurrency mining companies are already using renewable energy to power their operations. For example, the cryptocurrency mining company, Square, has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030.\nDeveloping energy-efficient mining equipment: Cryptocurrency mining companies can reduce their energy consumption by developing energy-efficient mining equipment. For example, some companies are developing ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) that are designed to consume less energy than traditional computer processors.\nImplementing proof-of-stake consensus mechanism: Another way to reduce the energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining is to implement the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Proof-of-stake is an alternative to proof-of-work, which is the current consensus mechanism used by most cryptocurrencies. Proof-of-stake does not require miners to solve complex mathematical problems to verify transactions. Instead, it relies on a random selection process to choose a validator who is responsible for verifying transactions. Validators are required to hold a certain amount of cryptocurrency, which acts as a stake. If a validator acts maliciously, their stake is forfeited. The proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is less energy-intensive than proof-of-work, making it a more sustainable alternative.\nCarbon offsetting: Cryptocurrency mining companies can offset their carbon emissions by investing in renewable energy projects or purchasing carbon credits. Carbon offsetting is a way to neutralize the carbon emissions associated with cryptocurrency mining by investing in sustainable projects that reduce carbon emissions.\nBalancing Sustainability and Innovation\nCryptocurrency has the potential to revolutionize the financial industry by providing financial democratization and decentralization. However, this cannot come at the expense of the environment. The challenge is to balance sustainability with innovation. The cryptocurrency industry needs to take responsibility for its environmental impact and take steps to mitigate its carbon footprint. It is essential to recognize that sustainability and innovation are not mutually exclusive goals, but rather complementary.\nSustainability is a key factor in the long-term success of cryptocurrency. As the world becomes more conscious of the environment, consumers are looking for sustainable products and services. The cryptocurrency industry needs to recognize this trend and take steps to reduce its carbon footprint. By adopting sustainable practices, the cryptocurrency industry can attract a more environmentally conscious audience.\nCryptocurrency has the potential to transform the financial industry by providing financial democratization and decentralization. However, the high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has sparked concerns about its environmental impact. To balance sustainability and innovation, the cryptocurrency industry needs to take responsibility for its carbon footprint and adopt sustainable practices. By using renewable energy sources, developing energy-efficient mining equipment, implementing proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, and carbon offsetting, the cryptocurrency industry can mitigate its environmental impact. Sustainability is not a trade-off for innovation, but rather a complementary goal that is essential for the long-term success of the cryptocurrency industry.']"	['<urn:uuid:3e1e5ac3-49d3-4b00-8b33-3a2cfeee09be>', '<urn:uuid:16d423b7-32cb-493a-822d-c068233478c4>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	7	81	1531
47	I design HVAC systems and I'm curious - what's the key difference between how air source and geothermal heat pumps extract heat during the cold season?	Air source heat pumps extract heat from the outside air, while geothermal heat pumps extract heat from the ground. Geothermal systems use the earth's relatively constant temperatures, transferring heat from the ground into the home through a cycle of evaporation, compression, condensation and expansion using a refrigerant as the heat transfer medium.	['Heat Pump Problems | HVAC Heating & Cooling - Heat Pumps are very popular especially in the South where air source heat pumps are mostly favored over straight air conditioners with a gas furnace for heating. With a heat pump, one system can provide heating and cooling. Some people rely on a geothermal heat pump system or a water source heat pump. A geothermal heat pump extracts heat from the ground instead of the air like an air source heat pump works.\nHeat Pump Problems\nAir source heat pumps are cheaper to install than geothermal heat pump systems. However, geothermal heat pumps will save a lot of money over the life of the heat pump in operating costs.\nGeothermal heat pumps are more efficient than air-source heat pumps. There may be a time when your heat pump will begin giving you problems. We decided to post an article to help some people diagnose the heat pump problem. Remember always to be safe and do not go above your comfort level or skills. When in doubt, call a professional. Someone can do some minor repairs with minimal skills.\nHowever, we always recommend you call an HVAC contractor to repair the problem. Especially the more significant issues that require specialized tools. Before you get started, you may want to take a look at a few of our other articles.\n“How Heat Pumps Work”, “Heat Pump Components” and “heat pump sequence of operation“. To solve heat pump problems you at least need to be familiar with a heat pump. Being familiar with heat pump components will also help you. Additionally, reading troubleshooting heat pumps and heat pump breaker trips will also help you.\nCold Weather Heat Pump Problems | Delta T(°F) Between Supply & Return and Balance Point\nProblems with heat pumps can occur in hot or cold weather. The biggest complaint about problems with heat in cold weather is that the heat pump is blowing cold air. While the term “cold air” is relative, a real measurement of temperature should be taken to determine if the air is relatively cold or not. Since a heat pump is a forced-air system and humans feel cooler when a draft is present, you will feel cooler when the air is blowing from a supply vent.\nIf the air is less than 98° F. then you will likely think the air is cold. Relatively speaking, 98° F. is much warmer than the air if it is wintertime and the outside air temperature is 45° F. This temperature output for a heat pump is dependent on a few factors. What is the temperature outside and are the electric heat strips on?\nThe chart below shows BTU output based on outside air temperature when the heat pump is in heating mode. MBh in the chart equals 1,000 BTUs.\nSo you can see from the above chart that the amount of BTU’s produced by the heat pump drop as the temperature outside gets colder. So the balance point for your heat pump will be different than the balance point for another heat pump, and this will depend on outside air temperature, refrigerant type, and the size of the heat pump capacity-wise. I’ve seen charts on the web and other places that indicate you should get so and so much temperature difference between the supply and return.\nOr so much temperature difference across the evaporator coil. However, unless you look at the datasheet for your particular heat pump and know whether the heat strips are on or off, you cannot get an exact number for the temperature difference in either location when in heating mode. In cooling mode, yes, but not in the heating mode because of all the variables. For further help, we cover heat pump problems on a component by component basis below.\nHot Weather Heat Pump Problems\nFor hot weather heat pump problems, the biggest complaint is no cooling. Since the heat pump is like an air conditioner you may also want to pop over to our air conditioner troubleshooting category to see if you can find help in identifying the problem with your heat pump in cooling mode. The difference in components from an air conditioner to a heat pump could be the problem, but we cover components below.\nFrom my experience, getting trouble calls for no cooling for heat pumps in the summer, the most common problem was a low refrigerant charge due to a refrigerant leak. Other basic common problems include electrical problems such as a blown fuse, heat pump breaker tripping, bad run capacitor, or a bad compressor contactor. It is also possible to have an issue with your heat pump thermostat. For that, you can visit our heat pump thermostat troubleshooting page.\nHeat Pump Problems - Accumulator\nOne of the most problematic heat pump components that I often find wrong is the accumulator. An accumulator is a reservoir that allows liquid refrigerant to be stored and boiled off. It does this, so the liquid does not harm the compressor.\nIt protects the compressor in the winter. It is an essential component to prevent other problems with the compressor. The problem with all the accumulators is they are made out of steel. Accumulators are exposed to the environment and usually rust despite the best efforts of the manufacturer to paint and protect the accumulator from rusting.\nMost accumulators will rust out on the bottom. The heat problem will start with a pinhole leak allowing refrigerant to leak out. Eventually, the heat pump stops working until the refrigerant is added to the unit. The accumulator needs to be changed to eliminate the problem leak. This heat pump problem should be done by a qualified HVAC technician.\nDefrost | Heat Pump Problems\nThe next heat pump problem on the list is the heat pump defrost board. The defrost board controls the defrost in the colder months. The heat pump condenser operates below the dew point and collecting frost and ice on the heat pump condenser coils. The ice and frost on the heat pump condenser coils need to be removed. Therefore, the heat pump is equipped with a defrost cycle that will change the unit over to the cooling cycle. That causes the condenser coils to heat up and melt the ice.\nAt the same time, the defrost control board activates the heat strips or backup heat inside the air handler. That is done, so the occupants do not know the heat pump is on in the cooling mode. For whatever reason, perhaps they get wet, or some electronic component on the board goes bad. However, the defrost control boards will go bad from time to time and need to be replaced to eliminate the heat pump problem.\nOf course, the best replacement in many cases for a bad part is a direct replacement. So for the heat problem to be fixed, you need to get a new defrost control board from the manufacturer. It is best to get an HVAC tech to take care of the problem. The defrost control boards are usually located inside the condenser cabinet with high voltage. There is a danger involved in changing a defrost control board.\nThe Reversing Valve\nSpecific to heat pumps the next problem one can encounter is the reversing valve. The reversing valve will shift from cooling to heating mode. Then back again, depending on the setting of the heat pump thermostat and defrost control. Sometimes the reversing valve can get stuck and require a slight tap with a wrench.\nIf the wrench does not do the trick, then other measures must be taken, including possibly changing the reversing valve. Another problem that can develop with reversing valves is the solenoid can go bad and need to be replaced. Changing the reversing valve solenoid is an easy task compared to changing the reversing valve.\nThere are those reversing valves that leak refrigerant from the high side to the low side. Some refuse to shift and need to be replaced. To resolve this heat pump problem, an HVAC technician with good brazing skills needs to replace the reversing valve. It will require all the refrigerant to be evacuated. After the reversing valve is replaced the system will need to be recharged properly.\nThe next item specific to heat pumps that have had problems historically is with electric backup heat and systems that only have sequencers. A sequencer is an electric relay that will stage the heat strips for multistage heat strips. That is generally the case with larger systems, and the engineer does not want the whole system to energize at once but instead stage the electric strips to come on slowly in a sequence.\nThere are specific reasons for this sequence. However, the problem with some sequencers is the contacts inside the sequencer will not work properly. In this case, the sequencer needs to be replaced. Again, this is high voltage and needs the attention of a professional familiar with the unit. There is a shock hazard involved and can be very dangerous.\nConclusion | Heat Pump Problems\nThese are items specific to a heat pump that can give you problems. Specific problems can occur with your heat pump system. Some of these things require specific training in the proper safety procedures and for and handling of refrigerant. Sometimes it is best to call an HVAC technician to repair your system. We hope this helps you fix the heat pump problems.\nHeat Pump Problems', 'WHAT IS GEOTHERMAL?\nGeothermal energy (ground-source or geo-exchange) makes use of the earth’s relatively constant temperatures, transferring heat from the ground into the home during cold weather and transferring heat from the home from the ground during warm weather.\nWHY USE GEOTHERMAL?\nAdvantages of geothermal\n• No combustion products\n• 300-400% energy efficient\n• Pay for themselves quickly\n• Utility companies have rebates and special rates available\n• More consistent temperature control\n• Can heat and cool different areas of a home simultaneously\n• Environmentally friendly and renewable\n• Reduce annual emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitric oxide\nIf you are considering construction on a new home, replacing a furnace, renovating an old heating or air conditioning system, or installing radiant floor heating, why not consider a geothermal heat pump, the most efficient system available?\nHOW GEOTHERMAL WORKS\nThe heating process involves the extraction of heat energy from the ground, and moving it into the building. Transferring the heat from the earth to the building involves a cycle of evaporation, compression, condensation and expansion. A refrigerant is used as the heat transfer medium. The heating cycle starts as cold, liquid refrigerant passes through a water-to-refrigerant heat exchanger and absorbs heat from the low temperature source (earth loop fluid).\nThe refrigerant evaporates into a gas as heat is absorbed. The gaseous refrigerant passes through a compressor where the refrigerant is pressurized, raising its temperature to over 180 degrees F. The hot gas then circulates through a refrigerant-to-air heat exchanger where heat is removed as the cooler return air passes over it.\nNow heated, this warm air is delivered into the building by way of the blower and the duct system. Upon releasing its heat energy into the air, the refrigerant returns to the water-to-refrigerant heat exchanger where the process is repeated continuously during the heating process. A by-product of the heating function is the production of hot water that is delivered to the water heater by way of a small pump.\nThe cooling process involves the extraction of heat energy from the air in the building, and moving it into the earth. Transferring the heat from the air in the building to the earth involves a cycle of expansion, condensation, compression, condensation and evaporation. A refrigerant is used as the heat transfer medium.\nThe cooling cycle starts as the compressor delivers refrigerant to the water-to-refrigerant heat exchanger. Heat from the refrigerant is absorbed by (rejected into) the low temperature source (earth loop fluid) resulting in the refrigerant turning cold. The cold refrigerant passes through a refrigerant-to-air heat exchanger.\nAs warm, humid air from the return air duct system is passed over the cold air coil, the air is cooled and dehumidified the returned into the building, cooling the space.

48	cathedral of st helena chartres stained glass	The Cathedral of St. Helena features 59 stained glass windows depicting scenes from the Old and New Testaments, while at Chartres Cathedral, only a few 12th-century windows survived the 1194 fire, including the Belle Verrière window showing Mary and Jesus, which has been specially venerated.	"['Life on the road can be unsettling to the soul, so from time to time–when passing through towns and cities–we’ll randomly take our time to wander through a variety of houses of worship for a healthy dose of salvation and inner peace.\nAs we’ve wound our way across America, several sanctuaries have stood out for their historical significance, stunning architecture, and their integration into the communities they serve.\nThe chapel of the Mission San Antonio de Valero, better known as the Alamo, was founded in the early 18th century as a Roman Catholic mission along the San Antonio River,\nand distinguished itself as the Shrine of Texas Liberty, commemorating the Battle of the Alamo on March 6, 1836, when a 13-day siege ended in the Mexican army’s victory over 189 Texian soldiers.\nOriginally, the compound was intended as an education center for America’s Indians who converted to Christianity,\nbut, ultimately the Alamo became a fortress of New Spain militiamen after the Franciscan missionaries abandoned it in 1793.\nIn 2015, the Alamo was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.\nWhile exploring Big Sky country around Helena, Montana, Leah and I visited the Cathedral of St. Helena,\na Roman Catholic parish patterned after the Gothic form of Votive Church in Vienna, Austria,\nand distinctive for its 59 stained glass windows depicting scenes from the Old and New Testaments.\nNearly destroyed by an earthquake in 1935, the cathedral was restored to its original design after three years of reconstruction.\nThe interior was gilded in time for the Cathedral’s Golden Jubilee in 1959,\nand included in National Register of Historic Places in 1980–giving the residents of Helena something to crow about.\nRomanesque architecture defines the exterior of the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis, completed in 1914,\nand attributed to patron Saint Louis IX, King of France.\nHowever, the interior reflects from a Byzantine style rooted in soaring domes and mosaic art.\nInstallation of the Cathedral’s mosaics–which adorn almost every decorative surface of wall, ceiling and dome–began in 1912 and was completed in 1988.\nTwenty different artists collectively inlaid 41.5 million tessarae tiles of 7,000 colors, covering 83,000 square feet, making it the largest mosaic collection in the world.\nPope John Paul II designated the Cathedral a basilica in 1997, where it acts as the mother church for the Archdiocese, and seat of its archbishop.\nIn stark contrast, the Cadet Chapel–a multi-faith house of worship–soars heaven-bound at the Air Force Academy campus located in Colorado Springs, Colorado.\nWith 17 upright wings on edge, and piercing the sky at 150 feet, the Cadet Chapel is a stirring example of modern American Architecture.\nConstructed mostly of aluminum, glass, and steel,\nthe main sanctuary is home to an Air Force Academy demographic that is primarily Protestant.\nHowever, the lower level of the structure houses chapels and prayer rooms for Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, and Orthodox Christians.\nThe Cadet Chapel was awarded the American Institute of Architects’ Twenty-five Year Award in 1996, and was named a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 2004.\nAlso reflective of modern American architecture, and an homage to nature in its purest form is Thorncrown Chapel, nestled in the Ozarks of Arkansas, on the edge of Eureka Springs.\nConstructed from the same Southern pine indigenous to the site, the chapel is so integrated into the landscape that it stealthily stands camouflaged by its surroundings,\nand represents an inside/outside sensibility, with Arts and Crafts flourishes.\nThorncrown Chapel was named a National Historic Place in 2000, and received the Twenty-five Year Award by the American Institute of Architects in 2006 for design of enduring significance.\nThe Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Savannah, Georgia is a Roman Catholic sanctuary built in the French Gothic style, and was dedicated in 1876.\nTwelve years later, fire gutted the interior, leaving behind only the walls and towers.\nOvercoming adversity, the church community quickly rebuilt much of what was destroyed, and resumed inside services in 1900,\nwhile interior decoration continued for an additional 13 years,\nto restore the stained glass and organ loft to its original splendor.\nEmbedded in Savannah’s Historic District, the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist was awarded landmark status by the National Park Service in 1966.\nLastly, in our effort to somehow balance the preponderance of churches and chapels we’ve toured, we visited Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim Synagogue in the Historic District of Charleston, South Carolina.\nKahal Kadosh is notable as the country’s second oldest synagogue, and the oldest in continuous use. Established in 1749, Kahal Kadosh grew into America’s largest and wealthiest Jewish community by the end of the 18th century.\nA new vision of American Reform Judaism originated at this site in 1824 after parting ways from its conservative Sephardic origins.\nAfter Charleston’s fire of 1838 ravaged the city and destroyed the synagogue, a new Greek revival style was adopted for the new structure, with rich interior ornamentation,\nreminiscent of Greek temples.\nJewish services, according to reformist rituals and practices, were now conducted in English, with a new emphasis on organ music, and women were encouraged to participate with men on the main floor, breaking with a long-standing tradition of separation and isolation in the sanctuary balconies.\nThe rich history and diversity of religion and protected religious freedoms in America cannot be overlooked as increased debate centers around self-centered interpretations of our Constitution’s First Amendment.\nMoral outrage and hubris abound as politicians and public figures drape themselves in stars and stripes, while preaching to their flock from behind protective glass with handfuls of stones at the ready.\nA reckoning of biblical proportion awaits us if we cannot ascend beyond our intolerance, and let each other live as we would have others let us live–in peace and without judgement.', 'Chartres, the Belle-Verrière Window\nThe Belle Verrière window of the Cathedral the Chartres\n– father Johann Roten, S.M.\nYou are watching: Notre dame de la belle verrière\nThis window is located on the south side of the Cathedral, in ~ the entrance to the choir, in just 14. It consists of twenty-four segments: The three at the bottom of the window depict the 3 temptations the Christ as tape-recorded by Matthew 4:1-11 and Luke 4:1-13. The next six panels tell the story that Christ""s an initial miracle in ~ Cana as recorded in man 2:1-11. The following four main panels show four angels upholding a throne and also the Virgin Mary and her Son, Jesus. Ten small side panels depict angels doing homage come Mary and also Jesus.

The the twelfth-century home windows that survived, only this number of Mary and also the huge windows at the west finish were the just ones reputed worth reusing through the thirteenth century master. This image of Mary has actually for century been an item of distinct veneration and since the fifteenth century has actually been known as ours Lady that the Beautiful Window. In 1906, the glazier Gaudin revitalized Mary""s head. While prior to Mary""s stare was addressed straight ahead, she head is now inclined an extremely slightly towards the viewer""s left.\nMary is sit on a throne, her feet resting on a footstool, covered with a rug. She is pull on in a garment of a bright, luminous blue. Her head, surrounding by a blue nimbus bordered with pearls, is surmounted by a rich crown. A white veil drops in crease on either side of she head. She hands remainder on the shoulders of she Son, that is seated on she knees. A cruciform nimbus is approximately his head. His appropriate hand is increased in blessing. In his left hand the holds one open book where we read the words:\nOmnis vallis implebitur (""Every valley shall be filled."") that is a prophecy the the Incarnation discovered in Isaiah""s 40:4 and also recalled by john the Baptist in Luke 3:5.\nThe numbers of Mary and Jesus emerge against a background of magnificent red. The images are drawn with the biggest care. The garments with their symmetrical folds, the accessories along your borders, the architecture of the throne, every is treated with the minute attention to detail, there is no detracting indigenous the ingredient of the whole.\nIt is complicated to find a theme that unifies the whole window. The Temptation of Christ in the wilderness and also the wonder at Cana space two that the earliest cases in the general public life of Christ. Over there is no agreement amongst scholars why the glazier decided to encompass them here.\nSee more: Dorsal Venous Arch Of Foot, Dorsal Venous Arch Of The Foot\nImage shown: Notre-Dame de la Belle-Verrière -The upper portion of the home window (12 C and 13 C) in the southern aisle of the choir.']"	['<urn:uuid:351ccbef-f024-4009-b421-96f3b5aeefba>', '<urn:uuid:010e07d2-4c5f-43ef-a6ba-b93e4088f118>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	7	45	1625

50	I'm studying religious architecture and I'm curious about the Fatima Sanctuary - what is its historical significance from 1917, and how does the new Holy Trinity Church complement the site's design?	The Fatima Sanctuary gained religious significance in 1917 when, between May 13 and October 13, apparitions to three shepherd children occurred at Cova da Iria, with the final apparition on August 19 in Valinhos. The first monument built was the Capela das Aparições, followed by the shrine construction between 1928-1953. The new Church of the Holy Trinity, opened in 2007, complements the site by being positioned opposite the existing historic Basilica, creating a monumental axis. It features a 125m diameter circular layout and can seat 9,000 pilgrims, with a design that incorporates natural daylight through a saw-tooth roof structure and features artworks by various international artists.	"['Ourém belongs to the municipality of Santarém and is mostly located on a plain, having its highest point in cabeço de Óbidos. Its primitive name was Abdegas, being replaced in the 12th century by the Latin word Aurem. After having been under Moorish domination, it was conquered by Dom Afonso Henriques in 1136. Ourém Castle was built in 1178, developed afterwards around the village, where today the historic center lies. It was only elevated to town in 1991, as until then it was known as Vila Nova de Ourém (New Village of Ourém). The best known area of this municipality is Fátima for its importance in religious terms, which earned the biggest tourist complex of Rota do Sol. It was in the place of Cova da Iria where, in 1917, more precisely between May 13 and October 13, according to Catholic beliefs, the apparitions to three shepherd children took place. On August 19 occurred the last apparition, this time in Valinhos. Later several monuments were constructed, the first being the Capela das Aparições (Chapel of the Apparitions) in Cova da Iria. Later, between 1928 and 1953, the shrine of Fátima was built. You can also visit the house where Francisco and Jacinta, two of the three Shepherd children, lived and the Museu das Aparições de Fátima (Museum of the Apparitions of Fatima), where the apparitions and the message the Virgin has given to the shepherds are depicted. Another attraction in the area are the Grutas da Moeda de São Mamede caves, discovered in 1971 by two hunters.

International competition by invitation, 1st prize.\nIn collaboration with P. Santos, architect, for the execution of the design\nIn order to erect a Church for 9,000 seated pilgrims, the Sanctuary of Fatima launched a two stage competition between pre-selected architects. The new building is set opposite the existing historic Basilica and in front of the Pastoral Centre at the south end of the 500X150m plaza with easy access for large numbers of visitors. It thus creates a monumental axis which is further accentuated by the circular shape of the new structure.\nThe basic principles of the design encompass a sensitive approach to the site, interaction with the existing religious activities and an architecture that uses simple means to evoke the desired religious atmosphere. Two basic elements, a 125m diameter circle and a linear element in the form of two large (180 m) beams intersecting it, are the geometric shapes that dominate the architecture. A symmetrical circular layout has been chosen for symbolic, aesthetic and functional reasons due to the size of the building, so as to enhance monumentality, the dominating central axis and the closeness of the congregation to the Presbytery.\nThe building is developed on two levels. The main ground level gently rises from the existing square. The Chapels in front are developed underground so as not to exceed the floor level of the plaza and impede the monumental relationship of the old and new church. Other auxiliary spaces are also entirely developed underground with connecting ramps and stairs to the main areas of circulation. The Church has a recessed main entrance on the level of the square. Access ramps, defined by the two side walls and the two centrally located shallow reflecting pools contribute to a gradual transition from the open, inevitably noisy public space, to the underground Chapels and Confession areas, preparing the visitors for contemplation and prayer.\nFunctionally, the main interior space, which further to its function as a Church can also be used for assemblies, can be divided into two zones. Accordingly, the hall can be used either for a smaller number of up to 3,000 or to its full capacity of about 9,000 seated persons.\nThe main circular interior space, despite its size, embraces the congregation intimately maintaining the feeling of a Church and providing a panoramic view of the Presbytery. The external walls, clad in a light beige colour sandstone similar to the existing buildings, and the -invisible from the outside- saw-tooth roof structure define the character of the building.\nThe roof is intersected by the two beams that create a central axis, which rises towards the altar in a counter-movement to the sloping floor. It emphasizes the vertical focus related to the purpose of the place and incorporates south-facing daylighting that accentuates the procession from the entrance to the altar. The remaining two parts of the roof on either side of the central beams consist of a saw-tooth shed steel construction which further to permitting the use of daylight, functions as a structural element that frees the hall from vertical supports. The south-facing inclined surfaces of the sheds serve both to reflect daylight towards the north-facing clerestory strip windows and to support 3,200m2 of photovoltaic panels. A translucent membrane is hung below the shed in order to avoid that it be visible from below and in order to create an overall soft distribution of both day- and artificial lighting. The uniformity or accentuation of day- or artificial lighting in different areas of the interior space can be computer controlled by closing or opening light directing blinds that are incorporated within the clerestory glazing and by turning on indirect artificial lighting when desirable. It could be said that the use of (day)light is the driving force of the overall design and the intense spirituality of the space.\nA number of pieces of contemporary art by artists from various countries (Robert Schad, Maria Loizidou, Pedro Calapez, Kerry Joe Kelly, Marco Ivan Rupnik, Catherine Greene, Alvaro Siza, Benedetto Pietrogrande and Czeslaw Dzwigaj, including the graphics by Francisco Providencia) are incorporated with the architecture, playing a major role in the overall quality of the space.']"	['<urn:uuid:5fc4ed73-ca67-4b17-8a8d-730c293e3869>', '<urn:uuid:f73857f0-d36d-4764-91c0-1aae90ea82e0>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	31	106	1983
51	What materials are used to build homemade aircraft nowadays?	Modern homebuilt aircraft use a variety of construction materials. While some still use traditional materials like steel tubes, wood, and fabric, many builders now work with sheet aluminum riveted on formed aluminum structures. Since the early 1970s, builders have also been using modern composite materials such as foam, epoxy, Kevlar fabric, and carbon graphite. These newer materials are lighter than steel, provide greater tensile strength, and make it easier to form aerodynamic curves compared to conventional materials.	['Definition: Aircraft that is still in the experimental testing phase of development, or craft built by amateurs from kits or plans.\nSignificance: Experimental aircraft are important for the progress of the aviation industry. Flight test of an experimental aircraft validates expected performance criteria, tests structures, evaluates handling characteristics, and more. Scientific research is dependent on flight test results from experimental aircraft. A new airplane as such is experimental, but a proven and certified aircraft is experimental when mounted with new, untried applications requiring testing.\nTypes of Experimental Aircraft\nA distinction must be made between true experimental aircraft and amateur-built airplanes constructed from kits or plans. The former category contains aircraft involved in research and design at costs reaching into the millions, while the latter group contains aircraft constructed by individuals for fun, at a substantially smaller cost. An experimental military project or airline endeavor may reach hundreds of millions of dollars before the production run gains approval. The homebuilt or kit plane project, on the other hand, is notably less expensive. Single airplanes built for personal use have flown at a cost well below $10,000. Another difference between the two groups of experimental aircraft includes the time spent in flight test. The large company projects may spend more than a year in flight test while a homebuilt or kit plane undergoes a basic forty-hour testing period.\nThe Design Process\nRegardless of the group to which the airplane belongs, every aircraft flying today began in the much the same manner. Industry discovers a need for a particular design or a mission requirement. After the creation of a new concept, pilots, engineers, and mechanics discuss and research ideas for the production of the new craft.\nThe next step is sketching the design idea. More than a few new ideas begin as pencil drawings on napkins in restaurants over lunchtime discussions. From the first idea sketches, aeronautical engineers further refine the drawing by use of computer-aided design software. During the initial design period, engineers exchange ideas and make concessions and compromises that are eventually lofted into the drawing process. Modelers next construct a model of the new aircraft.\nModels of the new airplane are necessary for many reasons. Wind-tunnel testing requires models of different sizes. Models enable designers to visualize proportional sizing. Problems not visible on a drawing board may vividly stand out in three dimensions.\nAfter studying the models in depth, technicians and engineers develop mock-ups of various sections and components of the new aircraft. These mock-ups allow others to test the airplane and offer their opinions to the designers regarding positive and negative aspects of the new craft. Mock-ups also allow pilots, engineers, and mechanics to spot problems before production of the aircraft. The earlier design changes can be made, the more economically they can be incorporated into the production schedule.\nThe Prototype and First Flight\nAt the completion of the design process, construction of the prototype begins. Construction of one or two copies of the new craft is required for testing. This is an expensive proposition; until the craft goes into mass production, per unit cost of the craft can be phenomenal. The purpose of the prototype is further research and development. Changes follow in quick succession as shortcomings become evident and better construction methods become available. As the first prototypes are readied for flight, flight profiles are developed for the initial flight and the flight test program to follow. The most exciting event at an aircraft plant is the first flight of a new design, an event anticipated by everyone in the company.\nTypically, first flights do not last more than about three-quarters of an hour. The only concern the company and the pilots have with the aircraft is whether it will fly. Initial flight testing does not try to test the edge of the flight envelope. Pilots, engineers, and managers are not interested in how fast or high the airplane is capable of flying on the first flight; they only want to see it fly and see it handle the way it is expected. Test crews will address other questions regarding the performance envelope later.\nAs test pilots put the aircraft through its paces, they keep meticulous data on every aspect of each flight. The company uses the data to refine the flying qualities of the prototype and suggest changes in the production run.\nAfter completion of the flight test program, the new airplane will finally reach acceptance. If it is an airliner, company officials from the airline will either accept or reject the new craft. Military acceptance is somewhat different, in that the airplane flies through a more intense flight test program. Additionally, flight tests of military aircraft involve weapons systems compatibility.\nHomebuilt Experimental Aircraft\nThe other type of experimental airplane is the burgeoning kit plane and homebuilt industry. In 2001, approximately twenty-two thousand homebuilt aircraft constructed by amateur builder-pilots were flying in the United States.\nOne organization dedicated to homebuilt enthusiasts is the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA). The national headquarters of the EAA is located in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. There are local chapters of the EAA throughout the United States that allow homebuilding proponents to exchange technical information and discuss problems or other building concerns. Members also enjoy the camaraderie of other members, along with the encouragement offered at monthly or biweekly meetings.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of the Homebuilt\nThere are many reasons pilots choose to build their own aircraft. One reason is performance. Since the 1950′s, aircraft manufacturers have done relatively little in the way of increasing or improving aircraft performance. For example, a popular older model production aircraft flies at 100 knots, burns 7.5 gallons of fuel per hour, and can travel up to about 500 nautical miles before refueling. The latest model of the same aircraft today can fly about 106 knots, burns approximately 8 gallons of fuel per hour, and has a range of about 500 nautical miles. There has been virtually no change over the years in its performance.\nHowever, ingenious amateur aeronautical engineers and pilots have produced airplanes using the same engines in newly designed airframes. These home builts are capable of 175 knots, with ranges beyond 1,000 nautical miles, using the same power plant, producing the same power at the same fuel flow. The backyard engineers have managed to attain much greater speeds over longer distances for the same amount of fuel.\nWhile an increase in performance is advantageous, there are limitations to the use of a homebuilt airplane. For instance, home builts or kit planes are restricted from use in commercial operations. They also require a large amount of time for construction. Some pilots complain about the handling qualities of the smaller airframes. However, in many instances the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.\nOne very important advantage is that of knowing the aircraft. As the owner-builder of the aircraft, the pilot is intimately familiar with all the systems of the airplane. Another benefit to constructing an airplane is that as the manufacturer of the craft, the builder is qualified to perform all maintenance and inspections on the airplane according to the Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs). In other words, each year, when it is time to inspect the airplane, the builder of the craft can save hundreds if not thousands of dollars in shop fees.\nAnother advantage homebuilt owners have over production aircraft owners is that they can build the airplane at their own pace, according to their own budget. A home-builder can spend $600 one month, and if funds are lacking the next month, the building process can slow down while the builder spends only $50, or nothing at all. For the pilot who has purchased an aircraft with a loan, however, the bank will want payment each month.\nThe time required to build a kit plane varies. With a fast-build option, a builder can have a plane airborne in less than a year. On the other hand, some builder-pilots have dragged out a project for twenty-five years. Average build times, depending on the make and model of the airplane, is about 2,000 to 3,000 hours of work. Working part time, this equates to two to four years.\nAfter the airplane is finished, it is time for the first test flight. For this important first flight, many homebuilders opt to hire a professional test pilot familiar with their design. This is a smart choice for pilots who have allowed their flying skills to degrade during the construction process. Many would like to fly their homebuilt on the first flight, but this is a case where vanity must defer to common sense.\nFollowing the initial flight, the homebuilder is free to fly the airplane through a test program. During this time, the airplane will be restricted to one geographical area for forty flight hours. After the airplane is proven through this test period, the restrictions are lifted. Now the owner-builder-pilot is free to use the airplane for personal use as any other airplane.\nSome experimental aircraft begin as homebuilt inventions to test new designs, such as Fred Weick’s homebuilt 1934 W-1A, which experimented with the use of tricycle landing gear.\nTypes of Homebuilts\nWhile the production market is limited, homebuilts offer a wide selection of airplanes to the potential builder, running the gamut from very simple single-seat ultralights to highly sophisticated, six-place family airplanes. A pilot desiring a production four-place family airplane that can cruise faster than 145 knots will spend more than $400,000, plus ongoing maintenance and upkeep. On the homebuilt market, however, one can choose from among many relatively inexpensive four-seat, high-speed, long-range airplanes. Similar savings can be made in home-building seaplanes and amphibious aircraft.\nAfter choosing the group of airplanes from which to select, a pilot might research the safety aspects of particular designs. The next decision is the airplane’s appearance, which is a matter of personal preference. Not only are there a wide variety of kits available for homebuilt plane types, but builders who want more than what is available on the market also can design a new craft incorporating all the desired attributes.\nMost homebuilts and kit planes are smaller in size and weigh less than manufactured planes. Coupled with proportionally larger engines, this tends to increase the performance of the design. Many builders opt for two-place designs that provide opportunities for a great deal of com-promise. Most pilots find themselves flying alone or with only one other person. When they have a need to carry more, they rent larger airplanes.\nConstruction Techniques and Materials\nAn exciting aspect of homebuilding is the selection of construction materials. Construction techniques vary with different airplanes. A popular airplane that uses construction techniques of the 1930′s and 1940′s is the Pitts Special. The fuselage of the Pitts is constructed of steel tube and wood formers covered with doped fabric. The wings are constructed of wood spars and ribs and covered in fabric. Other homebuilts constructed completely of wood are beautiful examples of artistic creation. Some use woodworking techniques that date back to World War I.\nConventional construction of modern light airplanes is sheet aluminum riveted on formed aluminum structures. In the early 1970′s, homebuilders began experimenting with foam, epoxy, and other composite materials. Many of the new materials, such as Kevlar fabric and carbon graphite, are lighter than steel and provide greater tensile strength. In addition to being stronger and lighter, some of the new composite materials are easier to work with and enable the builder to form the compound curves of aeronautical structures more easily than when working with conventional materials.\nWith the use of Stirling engines or engines that use other alternative fuels, pilots may be able to fly farther and faster than ever imagined. Modern engines are one reason homebuilts are capable of such great speeds. The fact that the aircraft is experimental allows owner-pilot-builders to select the engine of their choice. Selection of the engine can be just as varied as selection of the aircraft itself.\nThe modern certified aircraft engine is a costly item. A new Lycoming or Continental aircraft engine can easily exceed costs of $20,000. Propellers and other accessories on the engine can drive that cost up another $5,000 or $6,000. Although such high prices may be discouraging, the homebuilder has many engine options.\nThe engine on a homebuilt does not have to be a certified aircraft engine. Because the airplane does not adhere to the specifications defined by the Federal Aviation Administration, builders can use any power plant they find suitable for their design. Indeed, many homebuilts are flying using engines from Volkswagen cars, chainsaws, snowmobiles, or outboard motorboats.\nAn automotive V-8 engine powers one of the most popular homebuilts, the Lancair IVP. The IVP can carry four passengers in pressurized comfort at altitudes above 25,000 feet, at speeds greater than 330 knots. Another example for those who doubt the use of automotive engines is that of the Volkswagen engine. Properly adapted for aerial use, this little engine has powered airplanes as fast as 230 miles per hour while getting more than 80 miles to the gallon.\nWhile some doubt the validity of homebuilt and kit-plane flying, this class of airplane is here to stay. For individuals with some technical background and the ability to work with their hands, homebuilding is a way to acquire an airplane inexpensively. The rewards they reap flying their own creations are many; chief among them the cost savings the homebuilder will realize over the years of flying the airplane. Saving money, however, is only a part of the compensation. The greatest reward is watching people admire the airplane. Most homebuilders are very pleased to hear the comments others make regarding the craftsmanship and work invested in the airplane.']	['<urn:uuid:c599f0a0-02b7-4fca-bb03-d8aa9e4ee833>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	9	77	2283
52	medical expert here investigating effects on blood flow bosentan vs amlodipine treatment mechanism comparison	Bosentan and Amlodipine work through different mechanisms to improve blood flow. Bosentan acts as an endothelin receptor antagonist that reduces resistance in blood flow, enabling better heart and lung function. Amlodipine, as a calcium channel blocker, works by affecting calcium movement into heart and blood vessels, relaxing blood vessels and increasing oxygen and blood supply to the heart.	"['According to a study in Respirology published by Wiley-Blackwell, treatments with oral Bosentan reduces resistance in blood flow – allowing the heart and lungs to work more efficiently and in turn, enables patients to increase exercise capacity and quality of life.\nPAH is a syndrome where one experiences continuous high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, or the blood vessels supplying blood to the lungs. In PAH, the heart has to work very hard to pump against the high resistance and eventually weakens. When it loses the ability to pump enough blood, heart failure occurs and often death.\nAlthough there is no cure for PAH, there are treatments that are beneficial to the patients. Bosentan is an oral endothelin receptor antagonist that significantly improves functional status, increase blood flow and survival of patients.\nLead author, Mr. Geoff Strange says, “Quality of life is an important consideration in the treatment of diseases such as PAH, in which prognosis is typically poor. In such chronic diseases, patients view improvement in quality of life as an important measure of treatment success.”\nAfter three months of Bosentan treatment, patients showed improvements in their exercise capacity in the six minute walk test (6MWT), as well as domains that measured quality of life. Although the assessment of quality of life and 6MWT provides complementary data at individual time points, they did not correlate over time as a response to therapy.\nProfessor Eli Gabbay, from the Royal Perth Hospital and The University of Western Australia adds, “While quality of life and 6MWT data were parallel at individual points, quality of life may improve on Bosentan therapy independent of the improvements in 6MWT. The quality of life domains should be specifically assessed to improve the monitoring of patients with PAH as changes in quality of life cannot be extrapolated from routine clinical variables.”\nAlina Boey | alfa\nInflammation Triggers Unsustainable Immune Response to Chronic Viral Infection\n24.10.2016 | Universität Basel\nResolving the mystery of preeclampsia\n21.10.2016 | Universitätsklinikum Magdeburg\nTerahertz excitation of selected crystal vibrations leads to an effective magnetic field that drives coherent spin motion\nControlling functional properties by light is one of the grand goals in modern condensed matter physics and materials science.

53	hitler stalin alliance versus conflict timeline	Initially, Hitler and Stalin formed an alliance through the Nazi-Soviet Pact on August 23, 1939, where they promised not to go to war with each other and secretly agreed to invade and split Poland. However, this alliance was short-lived as Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa, invading the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. This led to intense conflict, culminating in battles like Stalingrad where the Germans lost 147,000 men and 91,000 were taken prisoner, while the Red Army lost 500,000 men. Stalin signed the pact knowing Hitler wasn't trustworthy but wanted time to prepare for war, while Hitler signed it to avoid fighting on two fronts.	"[""Appeasement- Giving into demands of a leader to satisfy short term goals and prevent conflict.\nThe policy of Appeasment was carried out by Neville Chamberlain (1930's) to give Hitler what he wanted in order to avoid war. It was a way to keep the peace as the L of N crumbled.\nReasons for Appeasement:\n- British people wanted peace and would not have supported another war\n- They thought the T of V was unfair and Hitler's demands were reasonable\n- Chamberlain wanted a strong Germany to serve as a barrier against communist expansion\n- Britain's armed forces were not ready for war\n- 12-13 September 1938- Hitler encourages Konrad Henlein (leader of the Sudeten Nazi's) to rebel and demands an union with Germany. Hitler threatens war.\n- 15 September 1938- Chamberlain goes to see Hitler and agrees to give Hitler the parts of the Sudetenland he wants (without consulting Edvard Benes, President of Czechoslovakia)\n- 22-23 September 1938- Hitler then demands he wants all of the Sudetenland; Chamberlain refuses and war seems imminent.\n- 30 September 1938 (Munich Agreement)- Britain (Chamberlain), France (Daladier) and Italy (Mussolini) agree to give Hitler the Sudetenland and the Czech's are told they have to accept the agreement. Chamberlain comes back with a piece of paper saying Hitler does not want to go to war.\nHowever, on 15 March 1939, German troops march into Czechoslovakia and took over Bohemia and and established a protectorate (part of a state controlled by a stronger one) over Slovakia. This brought the end to Appeasment because:\n- It proved Hitler was lying at Munich\n- It showed that Hitler was not just interested in a 'Greater Germany' (Czechs were not Germans)\n- Chamberlain could not trust Hitler and Chamberlain said Britain would defend Poland if Germany invaded.\nSuccesses and Failures of Appeasement\n- It gave Britain extra time to prepare for war and it maintained peace for a few years\n- It stopped the spread of Communism\n- It encouraged Hitler. He also had no intention of being appeased\n- It allowed Hitler to grow stronger as he got what he wanted\n- It proved how weak Britain and France were\n- It betrayed countries like Czechoslovakia\nWhy was Appeasement Abandoned?\n- October 1938, Oxford Elections- Chamberlain's conservatives won, but the anti-appeasement candiate got many votes\n- November 1938, Kristallnacht- attack on the Jews of Germany\n- March 1939- attack on Czechoslovakia\n- May 1939, Pact of Steel- alliance between Italy and Germany to help each other in times of war\n- Churchill's Speeches- he compared Appeasement to 'defeat without a war'\nNazi-Soviet Pact (1939)\nHitler's next target was Poland, so Britain and France pledged to defend Poland despite it was so far away. Stalin suggested an alliance between France, Britain and Russia (April 1939) which meant Hitler would not be able to attack Poland without going to war with Russia. However, negotiations dragged on into August as:\n- Chamberlain did not like communist Russia.\n- Poland would not let Russian troops go into Poland.\n- Stalin did not trust that France and Britain would resist Germany.\nOn 23 August 1939, Stalin made an alliance with Hitler (Nazi-Soviet Pact) and they promised not to go to war with each other and they (secretly) decided to invade Poland and split it between them. The pact was signed by Ribbentrop (Germany) and Molotov (Russia).\nHitler signed the pact because he did not want to fight a war on two fronts.\nStalin signed the pact because he knew Hitler was not trust-worthy, but the pact allowed him to prepare for war with Germany."", 'Operation Barbarossa June 22, 1941: Hitler launches Operation Barbarossa: Invasion of Soviet Union The Russians practiced a Scorched Earth Policy: Destroy everything the German’s would pass through Hitler’s largest Mistake of the War.\n1942 January: 26 nations sign the United Nations agreement Beginning of the Battle of Stalingrad.

54	compare oldest chinese texts what subjects cover	The earliest Chinese texts covered distinctly different subjects. The pre-Qin texts (before 221 BCE) primarily focused on divination (I Ching), governmental documents and speeches (Classic of History), poetry and songs (Classic of Poetry), ceremonial rites and social forms (Three Rites), and chronological historical records (Spring and Autumn Annals). Post-Qin texts (after 206 BCE) expanded into more diverse subjects including detailed dynastic histories (like the Book of Han), mathematics (Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art), military strategy (Art of War), astronomy (Treatise on Astrology), medicine (Compendium of Materia Medica), and geography (Commentary on the Water Classic). This shows an evolution from primarily philosophical and ceremonial texts to a broader range of practical and scientific subjects.	"['Book of Han\nThe Book of Han or History of the Former Han is a history of China finished in 111, covering the Western, or Former Han dynasty from the first emperor in 206 BCE to the fall of Wang Mang in 23 CE. It is also called the Book of Former Han.\n|Book of Han|\nThe work was composed by Ban Gu, a court official, with the help of his sister Ban Zhao, continuing the work of their father, Ban Biao. They modeled their work on the Records of the Grand Historian, a universal history, but theirs was the first in this annals-biography form to cover a single dynasty. It is the best source, sometimes the only one, for many topics in this period. A second work, the Book of the Later Han covers the Eastern Han period from 25 to 220, and was composed in the fifth century by Fan Ye (398–445).\nThis history developed from a continuation of Sima Qian\'s Records of the Grand Historian, initiated by Ban Gu\'s father, Ban Biao, at the beginning of the Later Han dynasty. This work is usually referred to as Later Traditions (後傳), which indicates that the elder Ban\'s work was meant to be a continuation. Other scholars of the time, including Liu Xin and Yang Xiong also worked on continuations of Sima\'s history. After Ban Biao\'s death, his eldest son Ban Gu was dissatisfied with what his father had completed, and he began a new history that started with the beginning of the Han dynasty. This distinguished it from Sima Qian\'s history, which had begun with China\'s earliest legendary rulers. In this way, Ban Gu initiated the Jizhuanti (紀傳體，纪传体) format for dynastic histories that was to remain the model for the official histories until modern times.\nFor the periods where they overlapped, Ban Gu adopted nearly verbatim much of Sima Qian\'s material, though in some cases he also expanded it. He also incorporated at least some of what his father had written, though it is difficult to know how much. The completed work ran to a total of 100 fascicles 卷, and included essays on law, science, geography, and literature. Ban Gu\'s younger sister Ban Zhao finished writing the book in 111, 19 years after Ban Gu had died in prison. An outstanding scholar in her own right, she is thought to have written volumes 13–20 (eight chronological tables) and 26 (treatise on astronomy), the latter with the help of Ma Xu. As with the Records of the Grand Historian, Zhang Qian, a notable Chinese general who travelled to the west, was a key source for the cultural and socio-economic data on the Western Regions contained in the 96th fascicle. The ""Annals"" section and the three chapters covering the reign of Wang Mang were translated into English by Homer H. Dubs. Other chapters have been rendered into English by A. F. P. Hulsewé, Clyde B.

All of these pre-Qin texts were written in classical Chinese. All three canons are collectively known as the classics (t 經, s 经, jīng, lit. ""warp"").\nChinese classic texts may more broadly refer to texts written either in vernacular Chinese or in the classical Chinese that was current until the fall of the last imperial dynasty, the Qing, in 1912. These can include shi (史, historical works), zi (子, philosophical works belonging to schools of thought other than the Confucian but also including works on agriculture, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, divination, art criticism, and other miscellaneous writings) and ji (集, literary works) as well as jing (Chinese medicine).\nIn the Ming and Qing dynasties, the Four Books and Five Classics were the subject of mandatory study by those Confucian scholars who wished to take the imperial exams to become government officials. Any political discussion was full of references to this background, and one could not be one of the literati (or, in some periods, even a military officer) without having memorized them. Generally, children first memorized the Chinese characters of the ""Three Character Classic"" and the ""Hundred Family Surnames"" and then went on to memorize the other classics. The literate elite therefore shared a common culture and set of values.\nScholarship on these texts naturally divides itself into two periods, before and after the burning of the books during the fall of the Qin dynasty, when many of the original pre-Qin texts were lost.\nBefore 221 BCEdit\nIt is often difficult or impossible to precisely date pre-Qin works beyond their being ""pre-Qin"", a period of 1000 years. Information in ancient China was often passed down orally for generations before being written down, so the order of composition of the texts need not be the same as that of their attributed ""authors"".\nThe below list is therefore organized in the order found in the Siku Quanshu, the imperial library of the Qing dynasty. The Siku classifies all works into 4 top-level branches: the Confucian Classics and their secondary literature; history; philosophy; and poetry. There are sub-categories within each branch, but due to the small number of pre-Qin works in the Classics, History and Poetry branches, the sub-categories are only reproduced for the Philosophy branch.\n|The I Ching (or Book of Changes)||A manual of divination based on the eight trigrams attributed to the mythical figure Fuxi (by at least the time of the early Eastern Zhou these eight trigrams had been multiplied to sixty-four hexagrams). The I Ching is still used by modern adherents of folk religion.|\n|The Classic of History or Book of Documents (Shu Jing)||A collection of documents and speeches allegedly from the Xia, Shang and Western Zhou periods, and even earlier. It contains some of the earliest examples of Chinese prose.|\n|The Classic of Poetry (Shi Jing)||Made up of 305 poems divided into 160 folk songs, 74 minor festal songs, traditionally sung at court festivities, 31 major festal songs, sung at more solemn court ceremonies, and 40 hymns and eulogies, sung at sacrifices to gods and ancestral spirits of the royal house. This book is traditionally credited as a compilation from Confucius. A standard version, named Maoshi Zhengyi, was compiled in the mid-7th century under the leadership of Kong Yingda.|\n|The Three Rites|\n|The Rites of Zhou||Conferred the status of a classic in the 12th century (in place of the lost Classic of Music).|\n|The Book of Etiquette and Ceremonial (Yi Li)||Describes ancient rites, social forms and court ceremonies.|\n|The Classic of Rites (Li Chi)||Describes social forms, administration, and ceremonial rites.|\n|The Spring and Autumn Annals||Chronologically the earliest of the annals; comprising about 16,000 characters, it records the events of the State of Lu from 722 BC to 481 BC, with implied condemnation of usurpations, murder, incest, etc.|\n|The Zuo Zhuan (Commentary of Zuo)||A different report of the same events as the Spring and Autumn Annals with a few significant differences.

55	How does fear manifest itself in the daily routines and behaviors of individuals struggling with compulsive perfectionism?	At the core of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder lies a deep fear of failure, which manifests through extreme conscientiousness, work-life imbalance, intimacy avoidance, inflexibility regarding changes in procedures or rules, and risk avoidance due to inability to accept imperfect results or uncontrolled circumstances.	"['Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder Symptoms, Diagnosis\nObsessive-compulsive personality disorder symptoms usually appear by early adulthood. People with OCPD exhibit a long-standing and consistent pattern of preoccupation with perfectionism, inflexibility, mental and interpersonal control, and rigid adherence to rules and procedures. (What is Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder?) They have difficulty expressing affection and usually only do so in a rigid, controlled manner that often seems insincere. When others openly express emotions around them, they feel uncomfortable.\nAt the core of the disorder lies a deep fear of failure, which gives rise to the primary characteristics of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder:\n- Perfectionism – extreme conscientiousness\n- Work-life imbalance – excessive time at work compared to personal life\n- Intimacy avoidance – avoiding close friends, family, or romantic relationships\n- Inflexibility – unable to agree to changes in procedure, rules, or standards\n- Risk avoidance – inability to take risks that may lead to imperfect results or an uncontrolled circumstance.\nSpecific Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder Symptoms\nObsessive-compulsive personality disorder symptoms manifest in specific ways and impact every aspect of a person\'s life.\nSigns of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder include:\n- Excessive preoccupation with details, lists, orderliness, rules, procedures, or schedules\n- Perfectionism so stringent that it interferes with task completion\n- Excessive devotion to work so that it interferes with social and personal activities\n- Unwillingness to delegate tasks to others for fear others will not perform up to his or her rigid standards\n- Extreme frugality or miserliness\n- Strict adherence to moral and ethical code, rules and regulations\n- Overwhelming need for order and environmental control\n- Excessive attention to detail\n- Excessive preoccupation with punctuality\n- Hoarding useless, worthless items with no sentimental value\nTo receive a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, these symptoms must significantly interfere with a person\'s ability to function in everyday life. Some people with OCPD have successful lives, especially professionally, for several years, but as external pressures and stress build, symptoms worsen and the disorder begins to negatively impact multiple areas of their life. (You can read about famous people with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.)\nConsider this: A person who shows excessive devotion to work is often referred to as a workaholic. The term ""workaholic"" implies an addiction to work. When you think of addictive behaviors, you probably think of them in a negative context – like alcoholism or drug addiction. But when someone is compulsively devoted to work, it\'s perceived as a positive trait, especially in males.\nThink about it. Often, those people earn coveted promotions and nice bonuses. Right? Not necessarily. That person could have obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. While he may earn recognition and praise for a time due to this seemingly endless devotion, the other OCPD symptoms will begin to interfere with professional success.\nOnce he begins to experience problems at home because he\'s missed too many birthdays, sports events, anniversary celebrations, etc., the pressure is on. To escape the negative home environment, he may dive even deeper into work, taking on more responsibility than he\'s capable of handling. Yet, he will refuse to delegate tasks to others because he thinks they might not ""do it right"".\nDespite creating numerous project-related lists, procedures, and standards, his rigid standards and need for perfectionism will paralyze him, rendering him unable to complete any of the projects on time, or at all.\nThis scenario illustrates just one example of how symptoms of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can impact a person\'s life and the lives of those around him. Most people with this and other personality disorders do not actively want or seek help until the symptoms begin to significantly impair the ability to function in daily life and destroy relationships with others.\nDiagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder\nOnly a licensed mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, can give a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. The practitioner will review medical history and ask a number of specific questions about the client\'s mental health history and that of his or her family. Next, the client will undergo a comprehensive psychological evaluation.\nOnce all the information is collected, the doctor will carefully review it and compare symptoms, history, and psychological evaluation results with OCPD diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM 5). After a definitive diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is given, the doctor can then begin to develop a treatment plan that fits the client\'s individual needs.\nGluck, S.

56	What are the main differences between civil law and common law when it comes to their historical development and use in different countries around the world?	Civil law and common law developed differently and are used in different regions. Common law emerged in England during the Middle Ages after the Norman Conquest of 1066 and spread to British colonies. Civil law, on the other hand, was primarily used in Continental Europe, with some remnants still found in Pacific islands like New Caledonia and Tahiti. While most jurisdictions in Continental Europe use civil codes, countries like Scotland have retained an uncodified form of civil law. Interestingly, even though Scandinavian countries have civil codes, they are not considered civil law jurisdictions.	['Even civil regulation, the nice science of the Romans, grew to become interesting in his hands, and was divested of its dryness and technicality.\nSome remnants of the civil legislation traditions are to be found on some Pacific islands, especially within the French territories of New Caledonia or Tahiti. How an lawyer approaches a case can also range significantly within the two completely different fields, according to Braden Perry, a former federal enforcement legal professional. Trespass to land occurs when a defendant enters plaintiff’s personal property with out consent of the plaintiff. Preponderance of Evidence – the standard of proof utilized in most civil trials; the jury is instructed to find for the social gathering that has the stronger proof, even if it is just marginally stronger than the opposite facet.

Even after they have civil codes, Scandinavian international locations will not be regarded as civil legislation jurisdictions. Certainly, there was additionally a reaction to legislation codification. The proponents of codification regarded it as conducive to certainty, unity and systematic recording of the legislation; whereas its opponents claimed that codification would end result within the ossification of the law. To take care of the disputes between individuals, organizations, or between the 2, wherein compensation is awarded to the victim.\nSome authors contemplate civil law to have served as the muse for socialist law used in communist countries, which in this view would principally be civil law with the addition of Marxist-Leninist ideas. Even if that is so, civil law was typically the authorized system in place earlier than the rise of socialist legislation, and some Eastern European international locations reverted to the pre-Socialist civil legislation following the autumn of socialism, while others continued using their socialist authorized systems. To preserve the stability of the state and society by punishing offenders and deterring them and others from offending.\nAccording to dualistic concept international regulation and municipal law are separate and self contained to the extent to which rules of 1 aren’t expressly tacitly received into the opposite system. The two are separate our bodies of authorized norms emerging partially from different sources comprising totally different distinction subjects and having software to totally different objects. In easy terms, the distinction between civil and legal laws lies in the codes and statutes used in the follow of each,” Odell says. He goes on to elucidate that legal law, which deals with offenses towards the federal government—crimes like murder, theft, drunk driving—is guided by the penal code. Only the government can provoke the prosecution in legal circumstances. Stare Decisis – the doctrine that requires judges to use prior circumstances as precedent on which to decide present instances.

57	How are communities using green infrastructure solutions to address both flooding problems and energy efficiency, particularly in areas like New Orleans's 9th Ward and other urban areas?	Communities are implementing various green infrastructure solutions including french drains, rain gardens, bioswales, permeable pavers, and rain barrels to address flooding. Additionally, they're utilizing green roofs and urban tree canopy to reduce energy costs, with green roofs cutting building energy costs by 10-15%. In New Orleans's 9th Ward specifically, organizations like Water Wise Gulf South are educating residents about these solutions through workshops that have reached over 500 people.	['In 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated the 9th Ward of New Orleans. The 9th Ward is bordered by the Mississippi river on the south and Lake Pontchartrain to the north. It is divided into three main sections: the Upper 9th Ward, the Lower 9th Ward and East New Orleans, which together make up the largest area of the 17 wards of the city.\nDuring Katrina, the Lower 9th was utterly destroyed and received most of the news coverage (and still does), while the Upper 9th and New Orleans East also experienced catastrophic flooding damage. Residents in this neighborhood fall into the category of most underserved, and that was especially true after the storm.\nKathrine Perry Prevost, who lives in the Upper 9th, had evacuated with her family to Williamsburg, Virginia. After the storm, all they could think about was getting home, but when they did, they found no one was there. Their community was still dispersed, with many finding it difficult to come home. They began going to city council meetings, working with the Upper 9th Ward Rep. Charmaine Marchand-Stiaes, putting fliers up, and hosting neighborhood meetings once a month.\nFor Katherine, the mission ahead was clear. Home was worth fighting for. It was time to rebuild and apparently it was going to be left to the residents to do it. So be it. Katherine began The Upper 9th Ward Bunny Friend Neighborhood Association in March 2006. By 2008, the organization had received its 501c3 tax exempt status. The mission of Bunny Friend is to stimulate the revitalization and rebuilding of the Upper 9th Ward through a comprehensive approach focused on neighborhood rebuilding and residential assistance.\n“Bunny Friend’s work has made a lasting impact on restoring morale among residents, and moving along the slow process of rebuilding the area. Residents look toward Bunny Friends as an ongoing resource to help them with restoration.”– Katherine Prevost\nPart of that is building the resilience of the infrastructure that people live with. The Upper 9th Ward Bunny Friend Neighborhood Association has a collaborative partnership with Water Wise Gulf South. Together they are building programs to educate the community on green infrastructure and its benefits. This process of empowerment has helped with implementing green infrastructure inside the Upper 9th ward community to address flooding, such as french drains, rain gardens, bioswales, permeable pavers and rain barrels.\n“In the three-pronged program, participants begin with a Water Wise Neighborhood Workshop to learn about green infrastructure and do-it-yourself green infrastructure projects that people can install in their own yards or gardens. Over 500 people have taken one of these workshops.”– People Power Stopping Flooding in New Orleans, Next City, Nov. 2021\nOther partners include Treme, Healthy Community Services and Lower 9th ward homeowners’ association. In addition, Bunny Friend works with a youth and advocacy group surrounding green Infrastructure. The goal is a sustainable and holistic community that can endure natural disasters and the impacts of climate change. An ongoin project includes a network of disaster solar shelters.\nA triple garden lot thrives, with an orchard of citrus, complemented by okra and collard greens, creating opportunities for giving back to the community and building the bonds that brought everyone back home and make them stronger.\n“These are environmentally unjust neighborhoods” already, Ms. Prevost says of existing hyperlocal risks, like the area’s heat-dome effect, in which an excess of concrete increases the temperature. “If we don’t do it, who’s going to do it? You have to care about where you live at.”– ‘We can’t wait,” Christian Science Monitor\nWritten by Michele Gielis\nFor more information:\nPeople Power Stopping Flooding in New Orleans; A Black-led collaborative isn’t just planting trees and building green infrastructure.

Only contractors who obtain certifications accepted by the state would qualify.\nThe legislation would essentially end the need to pay for energy efficiency upfront or through separate installments by creating a mechanism for utilities to collect money on behalf of lenders through energy bills.\n“If we save you 50 percent on energy efficiency and your bills are down, we can space the term of the project over five, 10 or 15 years,” said Dan Kartzman, co-chairman of Efficiency First, an energy efficiency trade group, and president of Powersmith Home Energy Solutions, in Bayshore. “Instead of it being tied to your house and normal credit, it could be tied to your energy bill. It becomes easier for people to understand and handle.”\nThe legislation, which would let people pay off projects through energy bills, follows the New York State Energy Research Development Authority’s earlier launch of a Green Jobs-Green New York program, which set aside $114 million to boost energy efficiency.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is launching a new strategy to promote the use of green infrastructure by cities and towns to reduce stormwater runoff that pollutes our nation’s streams, creeks, rivers, lakes and coastal waters. Green infrastructure decreases pollution to local waterways by treating rain where it falls and keeping polluted stormwater from entering sewer systems. In addition to protecting Americans’ health by decreasing water pollution, green infrastructure provides many community benefits including increased economic activity and neighborhood revitalization, job creation, energy savings and increased recreational and green space.\n“Through this agenda, we’ll help cities and towns across the nation clean up their waters and strengthen their communities by supporting and expanding green infrastructure,” said Deputy Administrator Bob Perciasepe, who announced the agenda at a Green Street, Green Jobs conference focused on fostering green infrastructure in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. “Green infrastructure changes improve the health of our waters while creating local jobs, saving communities money and making them healthier and more prosperous places to raise a family and start a business.”\nStormwater is one of the most widespread challenges to water quality in the nation. Large volumes of polluted stormwater degrade our nation’s rivers, lakes and aquatic habitats and contribute to downstream flooding. Green infrastructure captures and filters pollutants by passing stormwater through soils and retaining it on site. Effective green infrastructure tools and techniques include green roofs, permeable materials, alternative designs for streets and buildings, trees, rain gardens and rain harvesting systems.\nAs part of the strategy, EPA will work with partners including local governments, watershed groups, tribes and others in 10 cities that have utilized green infrastructure and have plans for additional projects. EPA will encourage and support expanded use of green infrastructure in these cities and highlight them as models for other municipalities around the country. The 10 cities are: Austin, Texas; Boston, Mass.; Cleveland, Ohio; Denver, Colo.; Jacksonville, Fla.; Kansas City, Mo.; Los Angeles, Calif.; Puyallup, Wash.; Syracuse, N.Y.; and Washington, DC and neighboring Anacostia Watershed communities.\nEnergy savings is one of the greatest benefits of green infrastructure. On and around buildings, green infrastructure can reduce heating and cooling costs. For example, green roofs reduce a building’s energy costs by 10 to 15 percent, and an additional 10 percent of urban tree canopy can provide 5 to 10 percent energy savings from shading and windblocking. Green infrastructure also conserves energy by reducing the amount of stormwater entering combined collection and treatment systems, which reduces the amount of wastewater processed at treatment plants.\nEPA will continue to work with other federal agencies, state and local governments, tribes, municipalities, and the private sector to identify opportunities for using green infrastructure and provide assistance to communities implementing green approaches to control stormwater. EPA will also provide additional tools to help states and communities leverage green infrastructure opportunities within other innovative environmental projects.\nThis site is protected by wp-copyrightpro.com']	['<urn:uuid:9780cf93-bcea-4f67-9f3f-9a0879772cc6>', '<urn:uuid:61802574-bdc9-4441-a2e8-65df93d9e7f3>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	27	69	1384
58	I'm fascinated by how pilots communicate - what are the main ways they exchange information both in the air and on the ground, from radio signals to visual methods?	Pilots use several key methods to communicate. In the cockpit, they use a specialized language called 'aeronese' that is extremely precise and economical, relying heavily on abbreviations and standardized phrases. For example, instead of casual conversation, they use specific commands like 'Gear up' with strict protocols. For radio communications, they use the international ICAO phonetic alphabet (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc.) to avoid confusion. When radio communication isn't possible or needs to be silent, visual methods are used, particularly signal lamps. These lamps can produce pulses of light to communicate using different colors (red, green, or white) and are still used today in air traffic control towers as a backup for radio failure. In modern aircraft, computer-generated voice commands also provide crucial information, such as terrain warnings and altitude readings during landing.	"['The language spoken in the cockpit is clear, concise and accurate. For amateurs, it may sound like fantastical gobbledygook, but the parlance of pilots follows a specific system – and has its very own beauty.\nSure, the poems and finely crafted stanzas of a Whitman or a Shakespeare have their own charm – for fans of great literature. But aviation fans prefer to listen to words with a glorious whiff of kerosene – the pilot poetry of couplets like this: 248° at D6.3 FFM/D3.5 FRD (MNM 800) RT intercept R140 TAU inbound RT intercept R084 TAU/R264 MTR climb to 5000.\nThe lyricism of aviators thrusts deep into the soul. Its stark, clipped majesty needs no flowery embellishment. Instead, this language relies on abbreviations, precision and accuracy. By the way, mysterious as they may sound, the lines above are nothing more than the command for a go-around maneuver over Frankfurt Airport, reduced to the essentials. It’s a lingo every pilot needs to be fluent in; a rough translation goes something like this: “Fly straight ahead on a course of 248 degrees up to 6.3 miles’ distance from FFM beacon or 3.5 miles from FRD beacon at a height of at least 800 feet. Then fly a right curve on the 140-degree radial toward the Taunus beacon. After passing the Taunus beacon, fly on the 084-degree radial toward MTR beacon or the 264-degree radial toward Metro and ascend to 5000 feet.”\nSpoken in the original, this is music to the ears of aviation enthusiasts. Anyone who has listened in on pilots communicating with air traffic control will have heard some of these phrases. When the pilots of a Lufthansa A380 request pushback at the gate in San Francisco, they don’t say: “Hi there, tower folk! Can we please leave the gate now?” They will say: San Francisco ramp golf tower, Lufthansa 455 Super requests push from position 101. Once the huge Airbus reaches the runway, tower clearance will be given using syllables and acronyms that instantly conjure up visions of the inside of a cockpit. : Lufthansa 455 Super wind 290 degrees 13 knots RWY 28R cleared for takeoff.\nTo amateurs, the lingo of the sky is an incomprehensible string of sounds, the ultimate jargon. That’s because pilots face a particular challenge. In aviation, perhaps more than in any other field, language has to meet three sometimes very tall -orders: It has to be economical, precise and absolutely unambiguous.\nThere’s no time for chitchat in the cockpit; elaborate, finely turned sentences are not only pointless, they can even be dangerous in certain circumstances. A superfluous syllable or verb, or a string of letters distorted by the microphone can lead to an unnecessary or wrong maneuver. Communication in aviation depends entirely on meticulous accuracy. Fast, clear and to the point: “Reduce to the max” is the motto – express yourself as clearly, as succinctly and as precisely as possible.\nPay attention and you will soon see that this is no easy task. The most complicated tool in the cockpit is perhaps not the artificial horizon, altimeter or autopilot but “aeronese,” the language used to communicate between earth and sky. It starts with the endless abbreviations – a particular characteristic of this language, and one that predominates here more than in any other area of life. In aviation, every pilot knows that ACARS refers to the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, that TCAS is a collision warning system and that PFD stands for the Primary Flight Display – the arrangement of the six most important instruments that, back in the early days of flying, were dubbed the “sixpack”: altimeter, air-speed indicator, variometer, compass, artificial horizon and turn indicator.\nEven common English words take on odd meanings in pilot speak. Who knew that “threshold” was the start of the landing runway? An apron isn’t only something you wear in the kitchen, it’s the bit of the airport where aircraft park. And just before the aircraft leaves the ground, when the pilot pulls back the sidestick, the cockpit crew will be saying “rotate,” not takeoff, which is more accurate because at this point, the plane is actually rotating around its lateral axis. Takeoff occurs a few seconds later.\nFewer words, more concentration, less language, fewer errors\nThe alphabet also plays a key role in aeronese. In radio communications between pilots, air traffic control and ground control, everyone uses the international ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) phonetic alphabet: It begins with Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and ends with X-Ray, Yankee and Zulu. These code words are used to avoid confusion when spelling parts of a message containing letters. Of course, the phonetic alphabet was no chance development but the result of many years of fine tuning. The military used to use different versions to communicate. A and B were spelled like “Apples” and “Butter,” and during World War I, English soldiers also used “Ack” and “Beer.” On March 1, 1956, the ICAO put an end to the confusion and introduced a new list of code words, also called the “NATO Alphabet,” which was easy to pronounce in all the world’s languages and dialects. The words that stood for each letter were easy to distinguish, thus avoiding misunderstandings, even in crackly radio communications. The alphabet was developed by the Canadian linguist and phonetician Jean-Paul Vinay, and it is still used today in aviation and marine radio communications to identify positions, reporting points or identifiers.\nIn fact, a great deal of aeronese comes from the military, and particularly the navy. “The condensed language of commands is the only way to communicate with precision,” explains Cord Becker, who for many years trained pilots for Lufthansa. The principle is simple. For instance, when retracting the landing gear after takeoff, the Pilot Flying (PF) will only give the order to “Gear up” once the Pilot Monitoring (PM) confirms with “positive climb” that the plane is ascending. The PM executes the command and replies briefly “Gear up.” Nothing else is said. Only in the event of a technical malfunction will the electronic systems on board report a fault with visual and acoustic signals. “Technical surveillance systems eliminate the need for much verbal interaction,” says Cord Becker, “and further reduce communication in the cockpit to what is absolutely necessary.” This is all part of the perfectionist approach of aeronese: fewer words, more concentration; less language, fewer errors.\nModern aircraft, by contrast, are very communicative. A computer voice will announce “Terrain ahead” if the aircraft is approaching a dangerous obstacle in the air. It will also count down the plane’s height indicated by the altimeter shortly before landing: “1000, 500, 400, 300 …” The plane also provides other alerts, for instance when the permitted sink rate is exceeded before landing. In the latest-generation aircraft, the systems will also alert the pilots when maximum reverse thrust is required after landing. In a loud and clear command spoken not with long words, but with minimalist precision, the aircraft will demand “Max reverse! Max reverse!”\nOf course, aviators are capable of banter when they’re not busy concentrating on work. For instance, pilots will refer to the cockpit as the “pointy end” whereas “donkey” refers to an engine. Old-fashioned cockpits full of analogue instruments are fondly referred to as a “watchmaker’s shop” and the autopilot is affectionately called “George.”These terms display the joy of neologism, hyperbole and gentle self-mockery, as evidenced in the following flying instructions – boiled down to the basics: “If you push the stick forward, the houses get bigger, if you pull the stick back they get smaller.”', '- Signal lamp\nA signal lamp (sometimes called an Aldis lamp, named after Arthur C. W. Aldis who invented a widely used design) is a visual signaling device for optical communication (typically using Morse code). Modern signal lamps are a focused lamp which can produce a pulse of light. This pulse is achieved by opening and closing shutters mounted in front of the lamp, either via a manually-operated pressure switch or, in later versions, automatically. The lamps were usually equipped with some form of optical sight, and were most commonly used on naval vessels and in airport control towers (using color signals for stop or clearance).\nAldis lamps were pioneered by the British Royal Navy in the late 19th century, and continue to be used through the present day on naval vessels. They provide handy, secure communications during periods of radio silence as well as other times and were particularly useful for convoys operating during the Battle of the Atlantic. There were several types. Some signal lamps were mounted on the mastheads of ships, some small hand-held versions were also used (\'The Aldis lamp\') and other more powerful ones were mounted on pedestals. These larger ones used a carbon arc lamp as their light source with a diameter of 20 inches (50 cm). These could be used to signal to the horizon, even in conditions of bright sunlight. Although it was originally thought that it was only possible to communicate by line-of-sight, in practice it was possible to illuminate cloud bases both during the night and day which allowed for communication beyond the horizon. A maximum transmission rate possible by using flashing lights is no more than 14 wpm.\nThey have a secondary function as simple spotlights.\nThe idea of flashing dots and dashes from a lantern was first put in to practice by Captain, later Vice Admiral, Philip Colomb in 1867. His original code, which the Navy used for seven years, was not identical with Morse, but Morse code was eventually adopted with the addition of several special signals. Flashing lights were the second generation of signaling in the Royal Navy, after the flag signals most famously used to spread Nelson\'s rallying-cry before the Battle of Trafalgar.\nThe Commonwealth Navies and NATO forces use signal lamps when radio communications need to be silent or electronic ""spoofing"" is likely. Also, given the prevalence of night vision equipment in today\'s armed forces, signaling at night is usually done with lights that operate in the infrared (IR) spectrum making them less likely to be detected. All modern forces have followed suit due to technological advances in digital communications.\nAir traffic control usage\nIn air traffic control towers, signal lamps are still used today, as a backup device in case of a complete failure of an aircraft\'s radio. Light signals can be red, green or white, and steady or flashing. Messages are limited to a handful of basic instructions (e.g. ""land"", ""stop"" etc.); they are not intended to be used for transmitting messages in Morse code. Aircraft can acknowledge signals by rocking their wings or flashing their landing lights.\nTransmission methods Notable signals Other writing systems\nin Morse code\nWikimedia Foundation. 2010.\nLook at other dictionaries:\nsignal lamp — signalinė lempa statusas T sritis fizika atitikmenys: angl. signal lamp; signalling lamp vok.

59	Which tests verify cosmetic product safety?	Several quality tests must be conducted including microbiological, toxicology, and stability tests to prove product safety before launch.	['In the growing industry of personal care and cosmetic, brands and manufacturers need to continuously create and innovate. The collection turnover is getting shorter due to seasonal constraints and fast-evolving consumers’ needs. To answer this changing demand, businesses must reduce their product time to market and costs while being innovative.\nNew Product Development processes should be optimized to better-fit market evolution using new available technologies. But, what are the main stages when developing a new product?\nThe marketing brief\nCreating the marketing brief is key when developing the new product as it is the starting point of every project. The more detailed it is, the easiest it will be to use it. Including in the marketing brief are the product and packaging requirements such as the product category, desired function, color, odor, texture, size, etc.\nOnce it is approved, it can be shared with other departments to start the product development. Research and Development team will use it to create the formula and product prototype. Packaging team select the product pack based on requirements indicated in the brief. The first stage is decisive, it will determine the whole process and product success.\nBased on the requirements of the marketing brief, scientist can now work on the product formulation. Each claim is analyzed and several prototypes are created for comparison. Concentration, allergens, chemical reactions or costs are evaluated to match the requirements and ensure product safety.\nRaw materials and packaging sourcing\nOnce the formula has been defined, the teams need to select raw materials and packaging suppliers. List of requirements such as substances’ function, allergens, size, color, odor, etc., are sent to several suppliers to be compared. Quality, costs, function are then analyzed for a final validation. As soon as raw materials are approved, the formula is finalized and the prototype is created.\nPackaging artwork design\nAfter selecting packaging suppliers, it’s time to work on the artwork design. Teams have to design the product outer packaging. Packaging is the first thing that consumers will see and read about the product. Text, colors, graphic, everything’s is chosen meticulously according to the outer packaging and marketing brief requirements.\nQuality and compliance\nIn order to be launched, product has to be safe to use and comply with regulations where it will be commercialized. Several quality testing must be taken such as microbiological, toxicology, stability tests in order to proof product safety.\nIn addition, all product components – including chemical substances and packaging, must be checked and compliant with the country of commercialization. Compliance teams must gather all the documents and information about the product that are required by countries legislation such as the Product Information File, Safety Data Sheet, Cosmetic Notification Form, etc.\nProduct final validation\nWhen each steps of the new product development have been checked and approved, it is time for a check. The final product is reviewed to ensure its conformity with the initial marketing brief. If the prototype passes the final tests the production can start. The product will be then be commercialized while teams will already be working on the next one.\nNew product development processes are different from a company to another. The product type, company size and strategy determines how product development will be implemented. But, all of of them will agree to say that it is long and complex to settle. Many stakeholders are involved and most of the time they do not understand each other. A Product Lifecycle Management software can be a solution as it has been designed to streamline NPD processes, in order to be more efficient and focus on consumers.']	['<urn:uuid:0e47eaf5-b60d-4ad6-8bb8-5603f750e3a3>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	6	18	598
60	latin boogaloo club dance styles compare	Latin boogaloo was a musical and dance genre popular in the 1960s that mixed Latin styles (mambo, cha cha, pachanga) with R&B and soul, featuring instruments like piano, trumpet, saxophone, and congas. It was performed as an upbeat, freeform dance. In contrast, modern club-based street dances like house dance evolved in Chicago and New York clubs, particularly to house music. While both styles emerged in urban settings, house dance developed more recently and is typically considered more oriented toward fun rather than competition, often practiced in nightclub settings rather than streets.

They are often improvisational and social in nature, encouraging interaction and contact with spectators and other dancers. These dances are a part of the vernacular culture of the geographical area that they come from. Two examples of street dance include b-boying (or breakdancing), which originated in New York City, and Melbourne Shuffle which originated in Melbourne, Australia.\nTraditional jazz dance, having existed since the late nineteenth century, is perhaps one of the oldest street dances of urban America. Street dance is often considered urban folk dance. Since many concepts of urbanization have existed for a long time back in history, the point of which folk dance is to be considered a more historical street dance is often broad and unknown. Street dance and folk dance are distinguished by when the terms were introduced for, the term \'street dance\' as a compound noun has been believed to have existed since beginning of the early 20th century, whereby Afro-American vernacular dance was becoming the most popular in the western world. Clogging is thought to be considered a very early form of street dance, since it evolved in the streets, factories and dance parties during the 18th century (or before) amongst dancers that were considered a part of the UK, Western Europe and Appalachian urban countercultures at the time.\nThe hip-hop dance style b-boying and the funkstyles popping and locking are some of the most popular street dance styles in African American culture. Those forms of hip-hop dance are the most prominently practiced street dances. These street dance styles are so common that commercialized versions have been professionally developed and choreographed for dance routines in pop, hip-hop, electronic, and R&B music videos. B-boying helped bring about street dance crew culture, whereby the dance crews would learn various street dance styles for impression and competition. These street crews usually perform in outdoor jams, leading to further styles of hip-hop dance. New Jack Swing (a.k.a. Swingbeat) was created in the 90\'s dance scene, which is also a respected style of streetdance. New Jack Swing is also a music genre, co-created by pioneers such as Teddy Riley.\nAnother example of a street dance is house dance, which is prominently danced to house music. House dance evolved out of Chicago clubs but grew and developed in the clubs of New York. Due to the modern mainstream popularity of clubs, street and fad dances tend to evolve more often in nightclubs rather than outdoor spaces. However, they may be practiced in outdoor spaces. Many rave dances are also street dances. The majority of rave dances are street dance styles since rave culture is prominently an underground movement. Rave culture, like hip-hop culture, is vastly diverse and there are many different music genres each of which have individually prominent vernacular dance styles. Amongst the electronic dance community, street dances in the form of rave dances are mainly revolved around a consistent rhythm and flow. Street dance styles like popping, tutting, and roboting, due to their futuristic-psychedelic theme and/or movements, have been widely adopted amongst the electronic dance community and influenced dances such as Liquiding. From out of the electronic dance community, street dances like Electro Dancing and Jumpstyle (an example of a rave dance) have emerged. Unlike many hip-hop dances, house and rave dances are usually heralded more \'fun\' than \'competitive\', although most street dances start like so before being adopted for competition or any other purpose since nobody legally owns them. Generally dances like the Melbourne Shuffle are not applied as a dance for battling, rather for dancing in the crowd at a rave party. This distinguishes rave dance from partner and competitive street dance forms. However, many people do perform rave dances as an expressively competitive dance.\nPunk dance (also known as the thrash dance, or simply thrashing) is a form of street dance that is performed impromptu in large crowds. While the punk dance is considered a fad dance, its origins also make it a street dance. The dance originated amongst the punk rock community and was made popular by the band, Sex Pistols. The dance styles are most popular amongst hardcore styled music concerts or raves, as well as busy nightclubs. The most modern form of punk dance is hardcore dancing.\nAdaptions to these street dances are today practiced at both dance studios and other spaces, i.e. studio hip-hop dance is the commercial version of hip-hop dance. Dance studios often dub the commercial adaptions as street dance, regardless to the fact they aren\'t \'absolutely\' by true definition. Some schools use street dance as a form of physical education. Another example is the Cha Cha Slide, and Cupid Shuffle, which are street dance influenced line dances. While line dances may be considered street, vernacular, or folk dances, they usually require professional instruction (or choreography) and integrate moves derived from studio dance styles.\nStreet dance has evolved between people in a social environment, although it cannot always be determined as to how they actually do evolve between people. In theory, as one person comes up with a move that apparently looks good to another person, that other person tries to copy that move. Similar to chinese whispers, the effect is that the other person cannot absolutely perform that move the same way as the other person, thus leading to the dancer to create their own style or entirely new moves based on it. There is a small difference between entirely freestyle (improvisational) dance and an absolute street dance. While freestyle dance is random and a personal dance invented by a single person (even if it is based on someone else\'s dance style), a full street dance is a collection of the various similar dance moves and styles collected into one practice and regarded as the same dance. For example, when b-boying evolved out of early hip-hop culture, people came up with their own moves, and other people improved them. Street dances constantly evolve for as long as they are intermittently practiced and regarded as the same dance. All the moves danced to breaks in hip-hop culture was regarded as b-boying.\nSometimes it is possible to trace back street dance styles that were mostly pioneered by specific persons. One example is Locking, which is often regarded as being started by Don Campbell, who was a 1970s pioneer of American street dance. Most of the time it is impossible to credit specific people for street dances, since the dances evolve outside of professional dance environments, whereby there is no social and/or legal record. Street/vernacular dance pioneers also rarely have professional degrees in dance, thus distinguishing street dance from other modern dance forms.\nList of street dances\nAfro-Caribbean vernacular dance\nSouth American vernacular dance\nWest African vernacular dance\nAsian vernacular dance\nEgypt Berry dance\nBritish vernacular dance\nEuropean vernacular dance\n- Stearns, Marshall Window; Stearns, Jean (1994).

61	what training intervals maximize muscle recovery rehabilitation	For training that involves strengthening or fitness, it is recommended that training occurs on non-consecutive days. Three sessions per week provides an ideal balance between enabling adequate practice while allowing for rest and recovery. This schedule is particularly important since muscles that undergo strengthening need repetition, rest and recovery, and excessive training can lead to fatigue that reduces session effectiveness.	"[""The concept of intensive therapy is to provide rehabilitation interventions at higher dosages. The purpose of this is to align our therapy approaches with contemporary knowledge of neuroplasticity by harnessing principles of motor learning to acquire new skills. So really, what we are saying is lots of practice in a short period of time right? Well, not quite. Simply doing lots of practice of something doesn’t necessarily mean it is effective.\nSo then the question really becomes - how often, how long and what is the actual strategy?\nTo answer this question, we apply the 3 - 6 - 9 principle.\nThis means 3 sessions a week for 6 weeks whilst harnessing the 9 principles of motor learning. The next question is why?\nThere is a lot of work that needs to be done to establish the exact dosage of therapy that is required to make a change. It depends on the type of goals, age of the person, the type of training, the cost involved and importantly - what is feasible? The impact of a lot of sessions can place undue stress on family dynamics and excessively fatigue the individual undergoing intensive therapy making sessions less effective.\nHow often or Frequency: Where does the 3 sessions a week come from?\nTraining new skills, particularly if it involves strengthening or fitness involves muscles. Muscles that undergo strengthening need repetition, rest and recovery. For many children, new skills do require strengthening - whether it is walking, sitting or reaching, strengthening is an important component. If muscles haven’t been used adequately in specific positions for specific tasks, they need to be strengthened in the way that they need to be used. When strengthening muscles or when fitness needs to increase, it is recommended that training occurs with enough rest e.g. on non-consecutive days. Lots of practice and strengthening is fatiguing and it can mean that you won’t get the most out of every session. Three days a week is a great balance of enabling adequate practice to occur whilst also enabling rest and recovery.\nHow long or Duration: Where does the 6 weeks come from?\nThis has largely come from research we have conducted which is again informed by previous research and current recommendations on physical activity. In our iStride study, we found that 6 weeks was an ideal time to make significant improvements in gross motor and walking skills. In fact, we called week 5 - “magic week 5” because we consistently saw changes becoming obvious and by week 6, both children and their parents were ready for it to finish. Families in our study reported that 6 weeks was feasible in that it was do-able whilst balancing home life, school and work, any additional weeks was deemed as being too stressful. At Healthy Strides, we have adopted the 6 weeks largely because of these reasons and we see it as the minimum time to make a meaningful change. Yes you could decide to keep going for longer but this is costly and the additional effect is unknown.\nFor skills that don’t involve walking but rather focus on hand skills or task specific skills, research has suggested that more hours in a day over a shorter period of time can have some benefits. However it is unclear whether any gains made actually carry over beyond the intensive therapy period. There is likely a relationship between the number of minutes of practice and number of weeks of practice but this needs to be balanced with what is feasible for children and families. If durations are shorter i.e. same number of sessions over a shorter number of weeks, the impact of fatigue needs to be carefully considered.\nWhat is the strategy? What are the 9 principles of neuroplasticity?\nAs mentioned earlier, just doing lots of therapy in a condensed period of time is intensive but it isn’t necessarily effective. Put simply, why would we do therapy if it doesn’t provide some sort of benefit?\nKleim and Jones published an influential article in 2008 outlining the 10 principles of motor learning that support neuroplasticity. Whilst 3-6-10 doesn't roll off the tongue quite as nicely as 3-6-9 ;) we have combined the Use it or lose it and Use it and Improve it principles.\nThe 9 principles includes:\nAll of these principles need to be part of every therapy session and over the entire intensive therapy program. At Healthy Strides, we integrate each of these principles into each session over the 6 weeks by following a 4 phase strategy.\nThe first phase is Elicitation where goals are set and all baseline assessments are completed. This is so important because it establishes the true baseline of where children are at so that the right program can be put in place as quickly as possible. Over a 6 week program or 18 sessions, the elicitation phase occurs in sessions 1 and 2.\nThe second phase is Stabilisation which occurs in sessions 3 to 5. This is where the formulation of a therapy program occurs with each of the principles intentionally integrated for each individual. This is such an important phase because it prepares for the very important consolidation phase.\nThe third phase, Consolidation, is where there is mass practice of the desired skill. This is where new skills develop and it is so important that the program is very targeted, intentional and specific. This phase occurs from session 6 to 15.\nThe fourth and final phase is Generalisation where the new skills are challenged and practiced in different settings. This prepares children to use their skills outside of the therapy setting so that the new skill can be used beyond the therapy program. This phase occurs from session 16 to 18.\nAs you can see, spreading the therapy sessions over 6 weeks gives children time to learn the skill whilst also enabling rest and recovery. However, if only shorter durations are possible, it is just important to establish what kind of goals are feasible and consider what additional practice is required outside of the therapy sessions in order to obtain adequate dosage.\nSetting goals and expectations are important and in many cases, shorter durations might just mean that we can complete the Elicitation and Stabilisation phase only leaving the consolidation and generalisation to occur at home or school.\nAt Healthy Strides, each session has a purpose and the principle of 3-6-9 provides a framework that aims to optimise the achievement of goals and new skills whilst also balancing the needs of life outside of therapy because friends, family and fun are equally as important.""]"	['<urn:uuid:2b67e476-1b2a-405e-8cf2-c4eb7c10e2b4>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	7	60	1097
62	greek ports ww2 piraeus damage	On April 6, 1941, Piraeus, Greece's premier port and essential supply link to Egypt, was severely damaged by a Luftwaffe (German Air Force) attack. A ship called Clan Fraser, loaded with TNT, was hit and exploded, causing widespread destruction. After the raid, only five of the port's twelve berths remained usable, numerous service craft were destroyed, and many skilled workers were either killed or abandoned their jobs. The explosion was so powerful it could be felt kilometers away throughout Athens.	['A PIECE OF AUSTRALIA\nThe AIF arrives in Greece, March–April 1941\nThey find themselves in a country that might be a piece of Australia towed across the world. The Greek spring with its white and piercing light, its floods of sun, its clean sharp water and, above all its exiled eucalypts, is closer to home than anything they have seen since they left Fremantle. 23\nAs the troopship MV Cameronia headed across the Mediterranean for Piraeus in April 1941, the men of the 2/6th Battalion AIF were briefed by Captain ‘Bully’ Hayes on the nature of the country they were going to defend. In the words of Lieutenant Jo Gullet, Hayes had read the available ‘literature and did his manful best’:\nThey [the Greeks, were not], as most of us might have thought, exclusively engaged in the fish and chip business. They had a splendid military tradition and they were currently belting the hell out of the Italians, but in times past they had also thrashed the Turks and also the Persians. The Turks were only next door, but how the hell they came to be fighting the Persians he could not say … They had other claims to our respect. Greeks it appeared were very strong on culture. They had invented democracy f’instance and the Olympic Games too … Soon you would see their wonderful old buildings. The Parthenon f’instance. Something to do with their religion. A sort of church. Damn near two and a half thousand years old, so we must expect it to be in a rather clapped-out condition, or so the sailors said. Well, that’s government departments for you. Same in Greece as anywhere else … There was no point in asking him any questions because we now knew as much about Greece as he did himself. We believed him. 24\nAs the 2/6th left the Cameronia, their commanding officer, Colonel Hugh Wrigley, determined that his unit would not straggle in a rag-tag fashion through foreign streets towards its camp. They were inspected, fallen in properly and with the battalion band playing Waltzing Matilda, they marched through Athens, as ‘Jo’ Gullet recalled, ‘not a little pleased with ourselves’.\nIn Greece the Australians were made to feel welcome and at home. It was spring and as units either marched or drove through the streets to their camp at Dafni, crowds waved and threw flowers into the road. On leave they had their pictures taken, visited the Parthenon and met the guardsmen of the crack Greek regiment – the Evzones. Kenneth Slessor felt that there was a ‘perceptible affinity’ between the men of the AIF, the ‘Argonauts of the southern world’, and the Athenians who were the ‘descendants of an age-old race whose monuments overshadow them’. Soon the city bars and cafes were crowded with Australians eating and drinking with Greek civilians and soldiers:\nIn all those places where the Australians meet Greek fighting-men straight from the front line, you see them clustered together, exchanging broken conversation. 25\nKeen interest was displayed in the local beer, wine and spirits. In a letter home Sergeant Robert Robertson, HQ 1st Australian Corps, provided a detailed account of what was readily available in the Athens tavernas:\nMuch time had been spent on the transport discussing what type of alcohol would be available and at what cost. But the results surpassed our wildest dreams. It was abundant, it was cheap. Beer brewed from the mountain streams was glorious and always served very cold at 18 dracma or 10 pence Australian the bottle. Koniak, a fierce form of brandy, could be bought at 50 dracmas the bottle or 2 drachs a nip. The same applied to ‘Ouzo’ … Proclamations posted in Athenian cafes stated that the sale of Ouzo was forbidden to members of His Britannic Majesty’s Forces … The plonk merchants were in heaven and the resultant effects were not in the interest of the army. 26\nThe Australian commander, Lieutenant General Blamey, met the King of Greece, George II, who spoke English fluently and with whom he sat chatting and smoking for 20 minutes:\nThe King [said Blamey] struck me as an easy and friendly man … eager and quick to respond and remarkably youthful in his manner. He … said how delighted he was to have the Australians in his country, since his dad had always admired them and had followed their deeds closely. 27\nBut beneath the initial colour and euphoria none could escape the fact that this was a nation at war. Athens was a city of women, children and old people, as most of the men of military age were at war in the mountains of Albania, and life was hard:\nEverything was grey and the people undernourished … casualty lists were read from the corners and it was touching to hear the women crying and screaming. 28\nDuring their brief interlude in Athens the men of the AIF were prepared for war. As Private Charles Robinson of the 2/2nd Field Ambulance recalled:\nIn the morning we were issued will forms and filled them out sprawling under the olive trees. No one could ever accuse the army of subtlety! 29\nSoon the Australians were hurrying north to meet the anticipated German invasion. They journeyed through a spectacular landscape of mountains and river plains with place names out of ancient history and legend – Thiva (Thebes), Mount Parnassus, Mount Olympus. Everywhere, as they moved through the countryside in railway wagons or in military vehicles, there was the same warm welcome:\nPeople lined the track cheering, smiling, and calling ‘goodbye’. Little did I realise the significance of this when a young despine (Greek girl) threw me a bunch of wild flowers, and with a wistful look in her eyes, called … goodbye! 30\nAs the 6th Australian Division’s fighting units began arriving at Piraeus from mid-March 1941, planning for the defence of Greece by the British force commander-in-chief, Lieutenant General Sir Henry ‘Jumbo’ Wilson, and the Greek commander, General Alexander Papagos, was well under way. It was clear that the initial German attack would be across the Greek–Bulgarian border in Thrace, but there was a real danger that German units would also strike through south-eastern Yugoslavia and then turn south and enter Greece via the Monastiri Gap and the Florina Valley. If the Greek and British forces were too far forward towards the Bulgarian border then they could be outflanked from the rear by this German movement through southern Yugoslavia. Consequently, it was decided that the British would hold a line from the sea through Mount Olympus, stretching north to Veria and then bending west towards Florina: the so-called Vermion–Olympus Line.\nOn Sunday, 6 April 1941, Lieutenant General Blamey learnt that from that day Lustre Force would be on its own. The Germans had attacked in Libya, driven the British back, and it would now be impossible for Wavell to send the 7th Australian Division or the Independent Polish Brigade to Greece. At 5.30 am on that same day in Athens, the German Ambassador, Prince Erbach-Schönburg, presented a note from his government to inform the Hellenic Government that Germany was at war with Greece. The Greeks were given no time for comment, for also at 5.30 am units of the German 12th Army moved into Greece across the Bulgarian border and into southern Yugoslavia.\nAs the German campaign in Greece opened, they dealt their enemies a severe blow. On the night of 6 April 1941, Able Seaman Patrick Bridges, RAN, was aboard HMS Hyacinth in Piraeus, Greece’s premier port and an essential link in the British supply line back to Egypt. He recorded the destruction of Piraeus by the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) in his diary:\nSunday April 6, 1941: Mass air attack here tonight. Hit 1 ship full of TNT, which burnt for 4 hours then blew up. A sheet of the ship’s side tore through our bridge and killed Lft Humphrey. Ship broke away from the jetty and we had to abandon it. We pulled it back and tied up and then run the gauntlet through blazing oil and burning ships and magnetic mines with only half a ship’s company.\nMonday April 7, 1941: Piraeus is still burning furiously. Sky is black with oil smoke and ammunition and dynamite is still exploding. Both our skiffs are holed. Bridge and boat deck are either wrecked or burnt. Great lumps of steel and shrapnel all over the deck. Drifting wreckage all over harbour. 1 plane came over to see damage … Waiting for raiders now. 31\nThe ‘ship full of TNT’ was the merchantman Clan Fraser, and the blast as it blew up was felt kilometres away throughout Athens. After the raid, which devastated Piraeus, only five of the port’s twelve berths were useable, dozens of small service craft had been destroyed, many skilled workers had been killed and many others quit their jobs.\nBy 9 April 1941, despite gallant resistance from the border forts on the Greek–Bulgarian border, Greek forces in the north-east were facing defeat. Hitler’s Panzers of the Second Armoured Division had swept round the western end of the Greek line near Lake Doirani and down the valley of the Axios River towards Thessaloniki, threatening to cut off Greece’s Eastern Macedonian Army. At 1.00 pm on 9 April, the Greek commander in eastern Macedonia capitulated. In southern Yugoslavia the German 40th Corps drove through the hapless Yugoslavs. The SS ‘Adolf Hitler’ Division now turned south towards Greece. Coming through the Monastiri Gap on 10 April, the division crossed into Greece and took Florina. At this stage, German progress was somewhat hampered by muddy roads that had also been cratered by British and Australian demolition units and repeated attacks by small numbers of RAF fighters and bombers. By 10 April, however, tanks of the German 9th Armoured Division and infantry of the ‘Adolf Hitler’ Division were pressing on towards Vevi and the Vevi Pass.\n23: Kenneth Slessor, official Australian correspondent, Athens, 30 March 1941 in Clement Semmler (ed), The war despatches of Kenneth Slessor, Queensland University Press, 1987, p. 140 (hereafter Slessor despatches)\n24: Henry ‘Jo’ Gullet, Not as a duty only – An infantryman’s war, Melbourne, 1976, pp. 40–41\n25: Slessor despatches, ‘Arrival in Greece’, Athens, 30 March 1941, p.140\n26: Letter, Sergeant RG Robertson, 19 May 1941, 2DRL/1304, AWM (hereafter Robertson letter)\n27: Slessor despatches, ‘Blamey and the King of Greece’, Athens, 1 April 1941, p. 141\n28: Bob Holt, quoted in Margaret Barter, Far above battle – The experience and memory of Australian soldiers in war, 1939–1945, Sydney, 1994, p. 83 (hereafter Barter, Far above Battle)\n29: Charles Robinson, Journey to captivity, Canberra, 1991, pp. 65–66 (hereafter Robinson, Journey to captivity)\n30: Sergeant Vic Hill, 2/4th Battalion, quoted in White over green –The 2/4th Battalion with reference to the 4th Battalion, Sydney, 1963, p.105 (hereafter White over green)\n31: Patrick Bridges, diary, 1941, in private hands (hereafter Bridges diary)']	['<urn:uuid:40bef3b7-ac1c-496d-90ba-36b71252ff25>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	5	80	1825
63	What is the original default log file growth rate?	By default, the log file is configured for a 10% growth rate	['If you are like me, you use the SSMS GUI for various things. Though, I tend to use scripts for the management of most things, I do check on the database growth rates of files using the GUI interface.\nWhile I was recently, doing a review of a client’s environment I discovered that the GUI can lie to you when it comes to the database file growth rates. By default, the data file is set to a 1MB growth rate and the log file is configured for a 10% growth rate. Both are horrible settings for most OLTP environments. However, starting with SQL Server 2016, the default growth rates are configured for 64MB, which in my opinion is better than the previous defaults.\nUsing the GUI to look at a 2017 Scratch database I have, we can see that the data file is configured for 1MB and the log file is set for 64MB growth.\nSpoiler Alert: The GUI is lying.\nIf we look into the DMV sys.master_files (sys.database_files will also show this), we can see that the growth rate is set to 16 for the data file and 8192 for the log file. The documentation tells us that these numbers represent the number of 8K pages, rounded to the nearest 64 kilobytes. Time for a little math! Let’s look at the log file first.\nThe DMV states that the growth is 8192 8K pages. 8192 * 8 = 65,536 kilobytes, which divided by 1024 will result in 64 megabytes. Awesome. The resulting answer matches what is shown in the GUI. We are good there.\nNow let’s look at the data file and reveal the lies.\nThe DMV states that the growth rate is 16 8K pages. 16 * 8 = 128 kilobytes, which divided by 1024 will result in 0.125 megabytes. Wait. Hold the phone. The GUI depicted that the growth rate was 1 megabtye. The math isn’t adding up to what the GUI tells us.\nAfter some research, I was able to determine that the answer for this discrepancy is in the T-SQL command, ALTER DATABASE. This command allows you to modify certain aspects of the database, include file growth rates. If you look at the documentation, notice that the growth rates can be specified in kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, or percent.\nThis means that you can specify the file growth in kilobytes with a command such this one:\nALTER DATABASE [Scratch] MODIFY FILE (NAME = Scratch, FILEGROWTH = 512KB)\nThis command would specify that the file growth rate for the data file, Scratch, is 512KB. After running the command on the Scratch database, we can see that the growth (remember: number of 8K pages) has changed to 64.\nLet’s do the math. 64 * 8 = 512 kilobytes. Ok, that’s the expected number since the command specified 512 kilobytes of growth. However, looking once again at the GUI, it still reflects 1MB!\nThe moral of the story? Don’t always believe the GUI. It can sometimes lie to you and cause issues. Double check values with other means such as DMVs.\nIn the case of my client, they had a number of databases that were manually configured to a smaller growth rate of 1MB and given they are a highly transactional organization, this was just causing issues for them creating more growth events and effecting performance.\nImportant: In order to grow the files, SQL Server has to take an exclusive lock on the files which will just stop everything in it’s tracks until it completes. Granted, it should complete quickly, however with a large transaction, it might have to grow many times within the transaction. Don’t ever do this.\n© 2018, John Morehouse.

64	What connects Sarajevo's history to both the start and end of war?	Sarajevo was connected to both the start of World War I in 1914 through the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and the end of the 20th century with the 1990s Bosnian war, as mentioned in both Khatibi's novel and historical records.	"['Interview with shortlisted author Said Khatibi\nWe hear from shortlisted author Said Khatibi about his novel Firewood of Sarajevo.\nWhere were you when the shortlist was announced and what was your reaction?\nI was at my father’s wake in Bou Saada south of Algiers. In the afternoon I turned on my phone to reply to some text messages. I had received a message from my publisher informing me of the news. It was an emotionally charged moment. I was happy that Firewood of Sarajevo was shortlisted. I recalled the time when I was busy with the draft, writing and rewriting with much passion and enjoyment. I think I gave my best at the time of writing.\nIs the mind frame for journalistic writing different from fiction writing for you?\nThere is a deeply entrenched literary tradition which seems to be dying out in modern times, that the majority of writers were once journalists. In Algeria for example, the first generation of novelists worked in journalism, including Muhammed Deeb, Kateb Yacine, El Taher Wattar and others. Journalism, as is well known, relies heavily on writers. Written journalism and literature are very different things but they are close and each benefits from the other.\nTell us about why you chose Firewood of Sarajevo as the title.\nSarajevo Firewood is the title of the screenplay which will be written by the female narrator. It is the same title that the male narrator will use to write his story. Sarajevo and Algiers are cities enclosed by bushes, and firewood is a part of daily life. The novel mentions how the last century began in Sarajevo and how it ended. The first world war erupted there and the century ended with the 1990s war. Algiers could see a reflection of itself there.\nDespite stressing the importance of identity in the novel, it seems as if wars and struggles are similar, and so are countries. How do you reconcile the two views?\nThe idea of the novel was born from being “surprised” at the similarity. I was not preoccupied with writing about two wars, but rather about the survivors of the tragedy, about humans and their pursuit of salvation. I wanted to experience with them healing from the war and liberating oneself from its mutations and the aftermath. At a quick first glance, one would say that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Algeria are geographically distant, but gradually, you will find that both mirror one another to a great extent.\nWhy do your main characters return to their homelands despite everything that happens to them? Is identity geographically linked?\nAn Algerian only leaves his country to return to it, and the same goes for a Bosnian. Both are in a state of constant travelling and have not resolved their relationship to history or identity. They go in circles and live with pending questions. The novel does not replace history in answering them, but it is a fictional work that can open up loopholes and draw attention to what historians have overlooked, in order to reach what others have neglected.\nThe novel does not follow a traditional linear narrative. Is this a personal preference or a literary necessity?\nIn my opinion, in order to understand what happened in Algeria or in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the end of the last century, looking at one era is not enough, we must return to past decades, to the aftermath of World War II and its repercussions on the Balkan territories. We must also understand what happened in the Liberation War in Algeria and the time immediately after that. This is how we can discuss and write about the modern history of the two states.\nWhich authors influenced you as a novelist?\nI do not have one answer to that question. The influences change as I get older. I read many Arabic and foreign works, fiction, philosophy and history, biographies, poetry, video tapes and memoirs. And many works have influenced me, too many to list here.\nWhat are you reading now? Has your reading list been influenced by the Coronavirus stay at home recommendations?\nFor me, not a lot has changed under quarantine, given that my daily work continues, with the difference that I work from home instead of the office. But it is an exceptional atmosphere filled with anxiety and contemplation. We feel its weight and pressure every hour. So I find myself these days in the mood to return to philosophy books that I had put off reading before.', '© All Rights Reserved AAY\nSarajevo is the largest city and capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has a historic reputation as a city of religious diversity, with Islam, Catholicism and Orthodoxy all well represented throughout the centuries. Although the area of Sarajevo has been inhabited since prehistoric times, it wasn\'t until it was conquered by the Ottomans that it gained prominence. It was under Ottoman rule that the Old Town (Stari Grad) was constructed.\nThe city was burned to the ground by the Habsburg Monarchy in 1697 and never fully recovered. It remained an important administrative center for the Ottoman Empire until the late 19th century when the Austria-Hungarian Empire conquered Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nOn June 28, 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, were assassinated in Sarajevo - an event that triggered World War I. Following the war, the Balkans were unified under the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1984, at the peak of a boom period for the city, Sarajevo hosted the Winter Olympics.\nAs Yugoslavia was disintegrating in 1992, Sarejevo was surrounded by the Yugoslav National Army and several paramilitary formations. The city remained under siege until October 1995, with drastic consequences for the population and considerable destruction. After the Dayton Agreement was signed in 1995, the city underwent a great deal of reconstruction, with very little evidence of the war remaining.\nSarajevo is now a cosmopolitan city that delights its visitors with a friendly attitude.\nThe city of Sarajevo consists of four municipalities (Općina):\nBjelašnica Mountain is in the central part of the country and is directly southwest of Sarajevo. During the summer this mountain is a popular place to go hiking while in the winter it is a popular downhill skiing mountain. The Bjelašnica Ski Area has several nice runs and a large area above the tree line, which is ideal for fans of bald peak skiing. The mountain is 2,067 metres (6,782 feet) high and is a day trip from Sarajevo. There is a accommodation on the mountain for people thinking of spending the night.\nThis festival began in 1984 and has since grown to become one of the most anticipated events in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Often held in the month of February, art exhibits from different parts of the world compete for the highest title possible, the Sestoaprilska Negarda Sarajeva.\nOne of the most popular cultural events in Sarajevo, the month-long festival of Bascarsija Nights features some 40 to 50 different events that honor the rich culture of Bosnia. It is marked by different children’s programs, literary events, film showings, classical music, and even opera and ballet.\nThe Sarajevo Fim festival is held annually in August. Long and short regional films from a wide variety of genres are shown (some for free). It also serves as a huge venue for artists from all over the world to meet and share their passion for the arts.\nHeld in November, Jazzfest Sarajevo is the best place to enjoy Bosnia and Herzegovina’s rich music scene. The city’s café culture is at its liveliest.\nSarajevo has a continental climate with warm summers and cold winters. Temperatures in summer are well above 25 °C during the day, while winter nights can drop below -10 °C. Rain (and snow in winter) falls evenly throughout the year. June and September are good months, avoiding cold or hot weather and crowds as well.\nSarajevo International Airport (SJJ) is located a few kilometres to the southwest of the city. There are good connections within Europe offered by B&H Airlines to Amsterdam, Belgrade, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Gothenburg, Istanbul, Stockholm, Vienna and Zürich, Austrian Airlines to Viena, Adria Airways to Ljubljana, Croatia Airlines to Zagreb, Germanwings to Cologne/Bonn, JAT Airways to Belgrade, Lufthansa to Munich, Malév Hungarian Airlines to Budapest, andTurkish Airlines to Istanbul. There are also seasonal flights to Antalya, Bodrum, Hurghada, Sharm el-Sheikh, Monastir, Jeddah, Medina (latter two both during Hajj).\nThere are no public transport links directly from the airport making taxis the most convenient option. Taxi fares are regulated and should adhere to the following rates: \nThe rate is increased by 30% during the night (10:00pm - 05:00am) and on Sundays and holidays.\nAn option to save some money is to catch a taxi to the nearby tram terminus at Ilidza and then catch a tram from there into the city.\nGRAS operates public transportation in Sarajevo. The centre of Sarajevo is served by a spinal tram network which makes a counter clockwise loop around the central district. This tram network opened in the mid-1870s and was the first in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Tickets should be purchased in advance from kiosks labeled tisak on the street or from the driver, where they cost slightly more (around 1.80KM). Tickets should be validated upon boarding the vehicle and are valid for a one way trip only. Changing tram or bus means validating a new ticket. A day card valid for unlimited travel on all local public transport in Zone A is available for about 5KM. Please note that inspectors board public transport very frequently: if you can\'t reach the validator machine because the tram is too crowded, then don\'t board the tram.\nMost of central Sarajevo, including the old town area can easily be navigated on foot. It is about 15 minutes from the central train and bus stations to the old town.\nSarajevo has countless shops selling burek (meat pie, sold in layers by weight or by piece), ćevapi and pizza stores. Pita (burek, sirnica, krompirusa, tikvenica, zeljanica etc.) is a filo type pasty pie generally offered in several varieties - meat (meso), cheese (Bosnian cheese called ""young cheese"" similar to ricotta and never aged) (sirnica), cheese and spinach (zeljanica), pumpkin (tikvenica), and spicy potato (krompirusa). It is usually served with a traditional yogurt sauce which resembles sour cream. Most Cevapi places do not serve alcohol.\nSarajevo has vibrant night life with a plenty small thematic bars. Clubs are usually opened until early morning. Thursday, Friday and Saturday are hot days to hang out despite the rest of the week offers quite good night life.\n|Hotel Alem||Put mladih muslimana 16,||Hotel||-|\n|America Hotel||Himzarina 23, Visnjik, Sarajevo||Hotel||-|\n|Apartment Orient||Kujundziluk 6||apartment||-|\n|Apartmentselma||Ocaktanum 30 Sarajevo||apartment||-|\n|Hotel Astra Garni-Sarajevo||Kundurdziluk 2, Kundurdziluk 2,||Hotel||-|\n|Hotel Astra-Sarajevo||Zelenih beretki 9, Zelenih beretki 9,||Hotel||-|\n|Bed and Breakfast Divan||M.

65	What role does early development play in goat kid survival, and what are the main health risks they face during their first weeks of life?	In early development, goat kids quickly develop agility and strength - within 24 hours they start bouncing and practicing running, which helps them develop evasive moves to escape predators and demonstrates their health to potential threats. As for health risks, newborn kids are particularly vulnerable to diseases like enterotoxemia (which affects fast-growing kids between 0-30 days) and floppy kid syndrome (affecting kids 3-10 days old causing muscle weakness and ataxia). They can also face risks from predators, which necessitates keeping them in protected areas with their mothers for the first 3-4 days.	['Ten days in the life of a baby goat\nAurora and Georgina were born in the very, very early hours of March 7 to our sweet Pandora. Their birth was fully unremarkable (we were sleeping), and Panny has been doing a fabulous job taking care of them. We noticed Pandora was in labor when I peeked at the barn camera/baby monitor on my phone, and when we made it to the barn both kids had been born. Within 45 minutes, the kids were standing and nursing and they’ve been growing crazy fast ever since.\nLike most herbivores that generally live in big, open areas, goats are prey to many carnivores. It is important, then, that the newborn babies be agile quickly, in order to keep up with a moving herd and evade predators. By the time they are 24 hours old, goat kids start bouncing. They practice running. They spring up into the air from all four feet at once, and they jump on things. Constantly. It’s adorable. But, I think it also serves two useful purposes. First, it hones the kids’ agility. They are practicing evasive moves that will help them escape a predator. Second, they are demonstrating to any predators that may be watching or stalking the herd that they are fast, capable, and healthy, so maybe that wolf should think about chasing someone else instead. Play is fun, but it is also important in development.\nWe keep new babies locked in a stall with their mamas for 3 or 4 days, depending on the health and thriftiness of the animals, as well as the weather. The gate to the pen has open slats, and the other animals like to check in, but keeping the newborns isolated helps keep them out of trouble while they practice those gross motor skills, and it makes sure they bond sufficiently with their mama. Aurora and Georgina are the only two babies in the barn at the moment, but Pandora still smells them every time they are near her and especially when they nurse. She recognizes them by scent and wants to make sure no one else’s babies are stealing her milk.\nAfter a few days of isolation, we do supervised excursions out of the pen. We divide our pastures with electric fences and it’s important that the babies learn how they work. Goat kids, and lambs, learn by touching, sniffing, and biting everything. It only takes two or three encounters with the electric fence for the kids to learn to stay away from them. We want to be there when they are learning so that we can help them out if they get tangled in the fence, or end up on the wrong side of it. Bill and I work together to teach the kids about the fence with one of us being near the animals and the other standing next to the fence switch, ready to turn it off if needed. It is a little heartbreaking to watch the kids get shocked, but the fences keep predators away from the herd, and the babies need to learn to stay away. Plus, it only hurts for a second. (I’ve been shocked many times. Because I’m not as smart as a baby goat…)\nWhen the goat kids are about a week old, they are usually fully integrated into the herd – sleeping and grazing along with everyone else. This afternoon when I went to check on them, Aurora and Georgina were sleeping in a hay feeder in the barn while Pandora was out eating the paltry pasture offerings with the rest of the goats and sheep. The kids woke up when they saw me and started bouncing around, heading for the barn door.\nBut, since mom was way out in the back field, I encouraged them to return to their nap. I picked one up in each hand, noticed their bellies were quite full, and plopped them back in the hay feeder. They stretched and snuggled back to sleep. The sun is shining, but today is pretty cold – still below freezing in the late afternoon. If it were a nicer day, I bet the goats would be napping in the field. The kids seem to know to stay put when mom is away and I’m sure Pandora will be checking in on them regularly.\nAt this point, the kids are only starting to explore hay and grass. They pay attention to Pandora when she’s eating in the pasture or at the feeders, and try to copy her behavior. To me, this is as adorable as bouncing. There is nothing cuter than seeing a tiny baby kid standing at a feeder with enormous sheep and goats. It is going to be a while before the kids’ rumens develop and they’ll be able to eat hay, so for now, when the adults are eating, the kids spend most of their time jumping and napping. Soon, though, they’ll be munching on grass and burping up cud with the rest of them!\nThe last exciting milestone to discuss is the initiation of sheep surfing. I saw a precursor to sheep surfing this morning when Georgina was standing casually on sleeping Clara’s back. Climbing on a sheep that’s laying down is the first step toward jumping on a standing one. It may happen in the next set of ten days, and I hope to bring you photos when it does!', 'Sheep & Goat Health.

66	What motivated a Nobel laureate's interest in studying unemployment theory from such an early age, and how did personal experiences shape this interest?	The Nobel laureate began working on unemployment theory at age 12, influenced by his concerns about his father's job security. He worried that if his father lost his job and his family reduced their spending, it would trigger a chain reaction where other fathers would lose their jobs, causing the economy to spiral downward. This early life experience continued to influence his research for fifty years, as he remained focused on understanding unemployment and other practical economic questions.	"['From FINANCE & DEVELOPMENT (Source: Mankiw\'s blog):\nIn his 2001 Nobel lecture, Akerlof describes his own life as a child and young man as mostly a happy one, but subject to the vicissitudes of his father’s career. Akerlof remembers thinking that “if my father lost his job, and my family stopped spending their money, then another father would lose their job and so on. The economy would spiral downward.” Worries about his father’s job prospects may explain, he wrote in the lecture, why “in some sense I began work on unemployment theory when I was 12. Fifty years later I am still mulling over the same subject.”His approach to economics:\nHe says that he is careful with the “facts that matter” and that his research has always been guided by trying to explain facts: “Why is there unemployment? Why do people report that they have trouble selling their houses? Why are some people poor? Why do people procrastinate? Why do people act up? Why do entire nations act up?”\nSince 1966, much of Akerlof’s career has been as a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. As with Yale, there is a family association; his great-grandfather graduated from Berkeley in 1873. When he won the Nobel in 2001, Akerlof gave the prize money to Berkeley: “I did that because I felt that they had supported me well and I wanted to show how grateful I was.” Christina Romer, a fellow professor at Berkeley, says that “George is a kind, generous, and enthusiastic person who loves economics. He contributes immeasurably to the department by simply being the kind of person he is.” She adds that his “teaching evaluations are simply off the charts.” Shiller says that Akerlof is like a father toward the graduate students he supervises: “He advises them to be nice when they go on the job market. The people interviewing you are hiring you to be a colleague, he tells them, and they want to see that you are a nice person.”\nAkerlof says he chose the example of used cars to make his paper “more palatable” to U.S. readers. But his interest in the subject had been triggered when, during his stay in India in 1967–68, he noticed people’s difficulty obtaining credit. He kept this example in the paper, along with sections on how the “lemons principle” could also explain why the elderly had trouble obtaining insurance and why minorities had difficulty obtaining employment. All this proved too exotic for much of the academic market of the time; the paper was turned down by three leading journals before it was finally published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics.\nSee the review of his book ""Identity Economics"" in this post.\nFew things to reflect on:\n- Does the future of economics depends on successfully including the insights form other sciences, specially psychology, neurobiology, etc.?\n- When it comes to the role of the government in periods of crisis, in the case of developing countries, we should remember that policies do not work in an institutional vacuum.\n- Why the used car market has not collapsed?']"	['<urn:uuid:62d6b92d-d530-4cae-a1b2-2b20afecf36e>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	23	78	517
67	bed bug bite show up time	A bed bug bite takes 24 to 48 hours (1 to 2 days) to show up.	['Exact Answer: A Day To Two\nA bed bug is a small insect that feeds on the blood of both humans and animals. In addition to their dependence on humans and animals for food, they also depend on them for transport as though they are insects they do not have wings.\nBed bugs do not measure more than a centimetre. They range from 1 to 7 millimetres mostly and are reddish-brown. Their body shape is oval and flat.\nA bed bug bite is generally not harmful. However, it makes one feel itchy and thus, uncomfortable. At most, they can cause some allergic reactions.\nHow Long Does Bed Bug Bite Take To Show Up?\n|Stage After Bed Bug Bite||Time Taken|\n|Visibility of bite||1 to 2 days|\n|Itching bite wounds||2 to 4 days|\n|Healing of wounds||1 to 2 weeks|\nPeople usually tend to panic if they happen to glance at any bed bugs. These creatures are infamous for not being able to get rid of them easily. However, their bites are of more concern than their presence.\nThe bed bug bites are itchy and a person should immediately lookout for such bites upon discovering any bed bug notorious insects.\nWhen a bed bug bites a person, they might not feel or even notice it at the beginning. Usually, the bed bug bites while a person is asleep. Moreover, the bite mark of the bug is small at the outset and is barely visible to the naked eye.\nThe bite mark takes time to develop into a full-blown wound that would be adequately visible to any eye. It swells up and might even turn red or brownish. It would take anywhere between 1 to 2 days for the bed bug bite to show up.\nAs the bed bug bite would grow, it would turn problematic and uncomfortable for the person. Within two to four days of the bite, it would become itchy and risks the danger of infection if pricked.\nHowever, the bed bug would not last for long. It is destined to wear off either by proper medication or over a prolonged period if left undisturbed. It would take a week or two for the bite to be erased.\nWhy Bed Bug Bite Takes That Long To Show Up?\nAs mentioned earlier, a bed bug is a small insect. Although it is visible to the naked eye, yet it can easily be written off or ignored when cleaning the house. One needs to take proper care in eliminating these insects.\nA bed bug can bite a person without the person even noticing it. The insect usually feeds on human blood at night times when people are in deep sleep. People do not even feel the insect crawling upon them once they are asleep. The bug makes a small bite that, at first can only be viewed with a magnifying glass.\nMoreover, the saliva of the bug contains an anesthetic. This chemical prevents the person from getting disturbed or getting awake and helps the bug feed to its heart’s content. This is one of the reasons behind the slow realization of a bed bug’s bite.\nAnother reason behind this long time is the small mouth of the bug. As the small mouthparts of the bed bug bite one’s skin, since the area affected is small, the bite does not show up early.\nHowever, as the effect of anesthetic slows and the wound spreads to the surrounding skin area, it gets swelled up. This swelling and skin redness becomes more pronounced when the mast cells release an enzyme called histamine. Such a prolonged series of actions take place within 48 hours of the bug bite.\nA bed bug bite takes 24 to 48 hours to show up. When a bug bites a person, it leads to a small bite which is so small that it is invisible to the human eye. In addition to that, the insect also releases an anesthetic to the host’s body because of which the person does not feel it.\nHowever, as the effect of the anesthetic wears off after a couple of hours, the bite mark starts to grow. It becomes red, swollen, and itchy after two days.\nI’ve put so much effort writing this blog post to provide value to you.

68	What makes automation projects fail, and how can proper planning prevent issues?	Automation projects often fail due to both technical and human factors. On the technical side, issues include poor scanner selection leading to 'garbage in, garbage out', inadequate image quality, and lack of proper integration with existing systems. On the human side, failure stems from resistance to change, lack of employee involvement in planning, and insufficient training and support. To prevent these issues, organizations should carefully evaluate hardware and software requirements while also developing strategies to manage resistance through proper communication, employee participation in planning, and adequate training. The implementation should be monitored and evaluated against original goals to measure effectiveness.	['While outsourcing invoice processing offers significant benefits with its low up-front cost, zero capital expenditure and ensuring best use of your knowledge workers, there are circumstances when it makes sense to automate accounts payable in-house. These include:\n- Confidentiality: some documents may not be able to leave the premises because of regulatory compliance, legal issues and/or heightened security requirements\n- Speed: physically getting your documents to an offsite document scanning service bureau may not be fast enough, such as in distributed capture environments where documents need to be scanned where they originate such as a branch office\n- Corporate Culture: some companies just prefer to do it themselves rather than outsource, particularly when they have low invoice volumes\nTo that end, you will want to find document imaging products and services that meet in-house requirements for accounts payable automation. A document management solution is comprised of several technology components:\n- Document scanner hardware\n- Document scanning and OCR software\n- Document management software\n- Workflow automation software\n- Integration with your ERP or accounting system\nDocument Scanner Hardware\nThe document scanner choice is a critical input into the entire system, otherwise it’s garbage in, garbage out. Many issues affect the right scanner choice. Will there be a single place where invoices are scanned, or will they be scanned throughout the organization? How many invoices are going to be scanned? What are peak invoice volumes?\nFrom a purely hardware perspective, there are many elements to consider as well. Cleaning and maintaining your scanners on a regular basis is important to prevent jamming, double-feeds and damage to the scanner. Does the scanner come bundled with image enhancement software like Kodak Perfect Page? If OCR-optical character recognition is being used in the process, high quality images generated from image enhancement software are a must. Can you use a network scanner that does not require a PC, or should you use a standalone scanner with a PC? Finally, consider the person who is prepping and scanning. Of the time needed to scan documents, document prep is 80%—this includes pulling documents from envelopes and files, removing staples, bindings and paper clips, batching, and inserting separator sheets and barcodes.\nDocument Capture Software\nThere is considerable effort within the document management community to put more intelligence into document scanning software, which drives the scanners. OCR and indexing technologies also continue to improve. These technologies enable invoice header and line-item information to be automatically pulled from the page and used to populate your accounting system so that the documents can be scanned, indexed and managed faster. These improved capture software solutions enable documents to be processed with fewer human touch points (i.e. no manual data entry and in less time with less effort). Make sure that you have the right capture application to meet your current and future needs.\nDocument Management Software\nDocument management software enables organizations to store scanned invoices and support documentation in a central repository for easy and quick access. A number of factors should be considered when choosing a document management system for invoice processing. If you have people in multiple physical locations, a cloud document management system or an in-house system accessed via a web server is critical. You should also consider the IT and programming requirements, the ease of use, speed of installation and cost. Do you need to consider document retention capabilities? Do you need to import documents directly from other applications, such as email, Word or your ERP system? Asking (and answering) these questions enables you to narrow your software choices, since no system is a dominant choice.\nWorkflow Automation Software\nWorkflow automation software allows you to electronically route invoices throughout your organization for action based on your business rules. It tracks who received what document at what time and date and any actions taken on that document. It eliminates the need for inter-office mail, and provides full accountability when processing invoices. For example, by using workflow, you will be able to determine how long exception invoices has been sitting in a workflow process without being touched. More importantly, it provides the ability to measure your processes, and take steps to improve them.\nIntegration with Your ERP or Accounting System\nInitially, you may only be using your solution to store documents. The brass ring is to integrate these technologies with your accounting system. Integration takes several forms. In some cases, it is being able to view a document from within your accounting application. In other cases, it may be a complete straight through processing application, whereby documents get scanned, the information is pulled from the document and compared to the ERP, and then posted to the ERP. Depending on what processes you already have in place, an integrated solution can provide significant benefits when processing invoices.\nThe information presented above provides you with some guidelines on elements to consider as you evaluate your options. Make sure that you spend some time on these elements when making these decisions, and have your vendor show you how their approach will solve these issues.\nLearn more in the whitepaper, Finance AP: A Sponsored Educational Guide to Understanding the Technology and Benefits of Accounts Payable Automation from Kollabria.', 'How organizations manage resistance to change\nSevere competitive and economic pressures that organizations face today were unthinkable a few decades ago. In order to shed excess costs and to respond more nimbly to customers and competitors, they are being urged to adopt new organizational forms, tightened inter organizational linkages and improved management practices (cf. Miles and Snow 1980, Johnston and Lawrence, 1988). Any change in organization is followed by a kind of resistance from its employees. In this assignment a few methods that can be used to overcome change in the organization are described.\nTechnology developments, social and demographic shifts, competition of changing market and economic issues, tend an organization to implement change in it as well. The rapid and dynamic change in market has increased consumerism. Whether it is an automobile industry or cosmetic industry or IT industry, consumer today has lots of choices these days that they need not have to wait for longer for any product. This changing market scenario imparts a message to managing bodies that the way of work should also change with the changing market. From managerial point of view a change is referred to as change in work pattern, work routine and work culture inside the working atmosphere. Change is normally a reaction to changing commercial, technological, economical, structural and strategic environment in which the company operates (Barbara Senior, Organizational Change). For example; departmentalization, job redesign, implementation of an international division are the examples of structural changes whereas work processes, methods and equipments are technological changes.\nChange should be welcomed as it can produce positive benefits for the individuals, bring opportunities for personal change and development, reduces boredom of work, provides new challenges and an opportunity to participate and shape the outcome. But unfortunately as change is accompanied by resistance, it is very important that the Change Manager anticipate and plan strategies for dealing with resistance not only at the introduction of change but also for monitoring the change over long term (Ronald, G and Smith, J 1995). It is helpful to understand why people resist change, because understanding this allows us to plan strategies to reduce resistance from the beginning. Kotter and Schlesinger identified the basic reasons of resistance to change are communication gap and inadequate information that creates misunderstanding, sense of insecurity, different assessment of situation and disagreement over advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, individuals are more concerned with the implications for themselves (Management by Robbins and Coulter).\nOrganizations do not change, individuals do. No matter how large is the project you are taking on, the success of project ultimately lies with each employee doing their work differently multiplied across all of employees impacted by the change (Web 1). Individual barriers to change include- tradition and set ways; loyalty to existing relationships; failure to accept the need for change; insecurity; preference for the existing arrangements; break up of work groups; different person ambitions; fear of power; skills and income; inability to perform as well in the new situation as for example, when quality control methods based on statistical models were introduced into manufacturing units, the quality control department have to learn the new methods. Some may fear that they will be unable to do so and may develop negative attitude towards the change or perform poorly if required to use the new methods. Sometimes change is resisted because of failures in the way it is introduced to the employees and the management fails to explain the need for change and its future benefits. Poor employer relations, lack of involvement in process and failure to offer support and training for the introduced change are the other reasons for change resistance (Web 2).\nResisting change takes many forms (Web 3) and the more obvious form is of active resistance, objection and refusal to cooperate with the change occurs. Sometimes, resistance appears to be individual and sometimes it is clearly situational. It may be passive in which colleagues agree to a change but are unwilling or unable to implement something new. This subtle form of resistance is dealt with more difficulty. For example, at a staff meeting everyone agrees to follow a new procedure, but after several weeks it is being discovered that the procedure has not been implemented yet. Another example of this kind is the introduction of new computers at the new place but virtually no one is using them for the purpose for which they are intended, since the staff had their own machines. The employee consents to change by agreeing to it but later he only changes to appear cooperative, but in fact he is doing most things the way he was before the change.\nAt the moment the change program is announced, many employees will employ tactics to protect themselves, their turf, and ultimately their place in the organization.Ã‚Â Some will aggressively challenge the necessity for change. This is a time waster and thus prevents critical objectives from being met. Every person who facilitates the change process must work diligently to build consensus. The employee must be assured that every idea is worth considering. If anyone argues, he or she can be asked to explain why he or she feels the way they do and ask for three or four suggestions for making the process work.Ã‚Â Some managers and members of the leadership team will avoid change by passively refusing the commitment to the process. Often these leaders will resist the change effort by being unavailable for meetings, denying resources, or withholding feedback. “The leadership” is a particularly difficult foe, because change efforts often require the use of resources managed by the leadership, such as time and money. Without these resources change efforts are likely to fail. Accountability with consequences is the primary means for assuring leadership participation. Many employees and organizational leaders search for personal or professional diversions during the change process that will ultimately hinder the effort. A distracted individual can undermine the change effort by not being present physically or mentally when his or her critical input is needed. Not being mindful of change creates an unnecessarily difficult experience for every member of the team. Such carelessness calls to mind the wasted energy expended when one runs against the wind. Change efforts provide an opportunity for every one affected to secure a new place in the organization or make a decision to seek a better fit elsewhere.\nKen Hultman argues that while no-one is a perfect change agent, managers have to be impeccable role models for bringing up a successful change. The essential attributes of such a person include the ability to be a clear thinker who is able to get a view about organizational situation and reach at logical conclusions. Hultman suggests few things in creating the right environment for change to occur. Firstly we must do things to establish a positive climate (p172) and secondly we must attempt to create environmental conditions that encourage an interest in improvement. Managers must demonstrate that how changes will improve employees circumstances and that there are opportunities in the change such as enabling colleagues to increase their knowledge and skills leading to genuine achievements and progress They must cultivate a value for collaborative working among staff and colleagues need each other to complete their tasks, it is easier to develop values of co-operation and mutuality. Whatever are the circumstances management must stay calm. At the heart of HultmanÃ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s analysis is a set of humanistic values along with an assumption that one cannot even hope to influence another colleague without firstly demonstrating that they will have their needs met in some way. It is likely to be counterproductive by getting impatient, exasperated and angry.\nBeing a change manager it is his/her duty to reduce the resistance towards change and towards change and to increase the enthusiasm and level of commitment for the change. While likely to encounter the people who resist change, people who welcome change will also be encountered and by knowing the reasons for their acceptance to change, the communication plan will be better formulated. People will accept change when they see possibility that they will gain something from the change. The gain may be either personal like, money; increased job security; status; self satisfaction; less effort and time and gain in better personal contact or other like it provides new challenges, likeness of the source, reduction in boredom etc.\nIn order to reduce resistance to change, the manager should involve people affected by change, actively seeking their thoughts and reactions to proposed changes. They must develop a proper attitude towards resistance to change and realize that it is neither good nor bad. The best way to minimize resistance to change is to involve those responsible for implementing it and those affected by it. People are more motivated towards successful completion when they feel that they are the valued participants in planning and implementing the change. Also ensure that people from all the levels of organization are involved in planning the change process and they should be listened carefully. In the early stages, manager should not launch into lengthy diatribes justifying the change as people are not interested in that. They want to be heard and have their concerns attended to. They must recognize that it takes time to work through reactions to change. Then people should be engaged in dialogue about the change. They should do this only after understanding the specific concerns of others completely. Change must be realistic, achievable and measurable.\nCommunication and education is helpful method to sort out the things when resistance is due to lack of information or inappropriate information and analysis. Though time consuming, this method provides great employee support if persuaded. When cause of resistance is difficulty in adjustment to changes, management support and facilitation do work at times. This is expensive and still unreliable way to overcome the change. Manipulation of some information is necessary some times in order to avoid negative reactions by the employee. The people that easily accept changes and get adapted to changing atmosphere can set an example for others and hence they follow the suit. Therefore, they should be the first target of change program.\nThree basic steps- planning, implementation, and evaluation of outcomes of both the plan and implementation are involved in the change process. Resistance to change should be dealt ideally with planning and early stages of implementation. For proper planning for change, a manager must consider about how and when the change is needed and the way it should be communicated to the employees for their better support. Managers should pay attention to the focus of change, the amount of change, and the rate of change in order to implement change. Evaluation of outcomes of change is also very important as all the change efforts are result oriented. If change is not monitored, its effectiveness cannot be measured. This can be done by collecting data and comparing the results against original goals.\nTo wind up at the end of an interesting discussion we can conclude that a degree of resistance is normal since change is disruptive and stressful but in general, most people have mixed reactions towards purposed change, so the change agents can be helpful in highlighting the positive aspects in realistic manner. Although most people feel comfortable with minor changes, no one can live and work by yesterdayÃ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reality. Managers must reduce change in very effective, meaningful and healthy way without hurting the sentiments of the employees. By providing resources to support the changes, allowing enough time and flexibility and with the widespread commitment of people throughout the organization, change efforts will succeed.\n(2) Hultman, K.

Similarly, conventional agriculture is evolving through vertical farming systems, which address modern challenges by growing crops in controlled indoor environments rather than traditional horizontal fields, adapting to limited land availability and resource constraints. Both developments represent responses to changing societal and environmental pressures.	"['Family Romance, LLC is the name of a real company based in Tokyo that specialises in renting out family members. For the film, its founder, Yuichi Ishii, has been cast as himself. The backbone of the story concerns 12-year-old Mahiro, whose mother has hired Yuichi to pose as her long-absent father.\nFamily Romance, LLC\nAs far as Werner Herzog is concerned, his new film Family Romance, LLC is a drama. Yet almost everything about it screams documentary — starting with that acronym in the title, which stands for Limited Liability Company and puts us firmly in mind of a business. Bureaucracy; factual matters. One genre is used to undermine the other, and in service of one of the film’s central themes: how much of this is real?\n""Sitting on a bench, Mahiro is reuniting with her father after more than a decade. But for Yuichi, this is just another day at the office""\nOn a busy promenade, Yuichi waits patiently in his immaculate suit, while Mahiro scuttles past multiple times staring at him, shrunk down in her hoodie. She covertly-not-so-covertly takes a photo of Yuichi on her phone, and so begins their meeting. Awkward and painful at first, the mood lifts beneath the cherry blossom in a nearby park. Sitting on a bench, Mahiro is reuniting with her father after more than a decade. But for Yuichi, this is just another day at the office.\nWe catch glimpses of the office’s other daily interactions, too. New clients sign up. Family Romance’s services are required at a wedding — one ‘father of the bride’, please! (The bride’s real father, a disgraceful alcoholic, has been banned from the ceremony.) A railway worker facing disciplinary action hires Yuichi to take the fall for him. In perhaps the most outlandish rental, Yuichi and co. turn up on the doorstep of a lottery winner and wave around a huge, novelty cheque, so that she can relive that life-changing experience one more time.\nAll this unfolds in the spirit of fly-on-the-wall curiosity and via the wobbly, transfixed gaze of a hand-held camera (operated by Herzog himself). Shot with minimal repeat takes, many of the scenes feel snatched like gifts, an endearing stiltedness favoured over mechanical narrative drive. Stylistically, Herzog finds a sweet spot between awkward and awestruck — which is a mood one suspects would colour much of the rent-a-family industry.\nAlthough the film is scripted, Herzog makes previsions for planned spontaneity. He sets up his specific scenarios, which of course are drawn from real life, and then the actors are given considerable wiggle room (to the extent that Herzog opted not to have a translator present while shooting.) Again, the director’s method mirrors his subject; Yuichi is surely a master of improvisation.\nA similar kind of planned spontaneity is a core tenet of psychodrama, a therapeutic approach developed by Jacob L. Moreno, in which patients explore internal conflicts by acting them out with other people on stage. Moreno believed that, by acting based on impulse, patients would discover new solutions to their problems, alternative ways to inhabit their roles in life.\nI suspect most Western viewers will see Yuichi and Mahiro’s burgeoning relationship with something like psychodrama as an emotional touchstone; that, as well as Freudian ‘transference’ (an unconscious redirection of feelings a patient has about one person on to another.) Yuichi and Mahiro might not be real father and daughter, their relationship is founded on a whopping lie, but does that have to mean that none of the feelings between them are authentic? Clearly, the situation is deemed valuable — otherwise Mahiro’s mother wouldn’t be footing the bill.\n""All this unfolds in the spirit of fly-on-the-wall curiosity and via the wobbly, transfixed gaze of a hand-held camera""\nFreud is ever-present in the film — at least circumstantially. Yuichi’s company is named after a 1909 essay of Freud’s titled ’The Family Romance of Neurotics’. Here, Freud, writing on children who believe their mum and dad are imposters and that their real parents are nobles or royals, suggests this fantasy is a way of dealing with the painful experience of disillusionment to come, an inevitable step on the journey to independence. Certainly, a playful name for Yuichi’s company.\nFor Freud, the unconscious is already a kind of theatre, full of ‘imaginative stories’, in which family members, like actors, perform their ‘parts’. Artifice, then, is an integral part of real life. Still, why is the idea of rental relatives so strange, even slightly upsetting? Does authenticity hold so much sway over Western culture? Should it?\nIn her 2018 New Yorker essay on Japan’s rent-a-family industry (which includes discussion of Family Romance), Elif Batuman writes that, in Japanese society, ‘rental relatives are often explained with reference to the binary of honne and tatemae, or genuine individual feelings and societal expectations.’ Often ‘the concealment of authentic honne behind conventional tatemae’, Batuman observes, is viewed as unselfish and socially generous, rather than deceptive.\nI wonder if, aside from deception, another form of resistance to the rent-a-family scenario is that the service is monetised. Something deemed sacred is sullied by its association with the market. We’ve internalised the story that money can’t buy love. Often, ironically, this story is told to us by the market itself (think of the double-bind in the MasterCard slogan: ‘There are some things money can’t buy, for everything else there’s MasterCard.’)\n""In Western society, the heteronormative nuclear family is not only still widely considered the ‘norm’, but the basic unit of production""\nIn Western society, the heteronormative nuclear family is not only still widely considered the ‘norm’, but the basic unit of production. From John Major’s Back to Basics campaign to David Cameron’s Marriage Tax allowance — and take your pick from any number of regressive Republican policies since the 1980s advanced under the cloak of amorphous ‘family values’ — familialism is used to push political and economic agendas. Perhaps what is troubling about the rent-a-family industry is not only the possible deception between individuals, but the mass deception it touches upon: the idea that the family could not possibly be bound up with money changing hands, when of course it is.\nBack to Yuichi and Mahiro sitting on that park bench, with pink cherry blossom falling at their feet. They watch a group of boys Live-Action Role-Playing. Herzog is giving us a parallel. Larpers are as diverse as their medium; I’m sure many of us consider it strange to see adults apparently playing make-believe, and these ones are deep in character, samurais fighting, dying, committing seppuku (ritualised suicide by disemboweling.) Larpers build a community based around a shared narrative they create. What’s so unusual about that? Herzog seems to be asking. What’s so different about a family?\nBy Sammi Gale', 'Agricultural systems around the world need to adapt to the rapidly changing environmental, demographic, and socioeconomic landscapes, and new alternative practices, such as vertical agriculture, may offer new opportunities to accelerate such adaptation.\nNext Gen Farming Without Soil and 90% Less Water | GRATEFUL\nWhat is vertical farming and why is it important\nModern agricultural systems encompass an estimated 1.5 billion hectares of the world’s surface area. With a growing population and resource needs, the availability of arable land is shrinking rapidly.\nSince the agricultural revolution, conventional agriculture has focused on practices requiring considerable quantities of space, water, fertilizer, and pesticides. The past 50 years have seen an accelerating rate of increase in these requirements as modern food production aims to increase productivity in the hopes of addressing growing food insecurity.\nLooking into the future, yield production is forecasted to decrease due to widespread environmental and socioeconomic changes that will generate unpredictable consequences on food systems.\nIn response, many strategies have been developed as alternatives to conventional agricultural practices. These strategies have focused on key principles and their combination to be effective: require less space, less water, and increase yield per unit of area. Moreover, due to the negative effects of agrichemicals, modern practices have also aimed to use significantly less to avoid potentially adverse effects for humans and animals.\nOne such alternative is the development of vertical agriculture, also referred to as vertical farming. As the name implies, vertical agriculture relies on expanding production vertically and not horizontally. Vertical agriculture is a multilayer indoor plant production system that allows for precise control of growth factors, such as light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, water, and nutrients.\nThis allows for the growing and production of crops year-round, completely independent of solar light and other external conditions. Indeed, vertical agriculture makes use of key concepts within ecology and physiology to optimize growing and fertilization within controlled conditions. For instance, elements of photobiology, thermomorphogenesis, hydroponics, and genetic breeding, are all used commonly across systems of vertical agriculture.\nBenefits, challenges, and disadvantages moving from horizontal to vertical farming\nAs a result of tight control over crop breeding, growing, and harvesting, vertical farming provides several benefits relative to conventional methods of ‘horizontal’ food production. This was the topic of a literature review by Kalantari et al. published in 2016 in the Journal of Landscape Ecology.\nFrom a systems perspective, the enclosed design prevents pests and diseases from entering by the adoption of a high level of hygiene, continuous monitoring, and non-chemical disinfection, providing security from crops. Moreover, recent technology has also allowed for automated control over environmental conditions by using sensors and imaging techniques in combination with crop simulation models and artificial intelligence, limiting the need for physical labor.\nVertical farming also allows for flexible organization, with designs ranging from large vertical walls covered with crops to large hangars or re-used shipping containers that can be transported. Consequently, vertical agricultural systems, can comprise many varying sizes and be located within many different areas from the middle of highly urbanized cities to more suburban or rural areas.\nMoreover, the verticality element of this system also provides nutrient and water flow, helping to reuse costly resources. The reduction in space also means there is a significant increase in yield per area, holding extensive potential for a future world of urbanization.\nFrom an economic perspective, vertical farming also provides for more jobs in localized areas and is community-focused by addressing the needs of immediate areas, which in turn can provide food at a lower price. Finally, the optionality of location for vertical systems also allows producers to reduce transport costs, as consumers may access them within urban areas, or transport can be minimized to nearby areas.\nHowever, despite the design, environmental, and economic advantages, vertical farming also incorporates several issues that remain a challenge to its broader implementation as a system.\nVertical farming has a high energy requirement and needs extensive investment costs to implement and develop successfully. Moreover, indoor issues relating to excessive UV, heat, and ozone-induced plant damage may have unpredictable repercussions for plant growth.\nAdditionally, vertical systems are difficult to adapt to a larger scale. They are costly to build and maintain and have yet to demonstrate the ability to provide food for larger areas than community-scale populations. This would make it difficult to implement in areas at higher risk of food insecurity, such as developing agricultural nations.\nThe lack of empirical research on a broader scale has meant that vertical farming has yet to develop past the concept stage on community levels, as persistent issues make it difficult to break through to a larger scale.\nImage Credit: YEINISM/Shutterstock.com\nGrowing skywards - the implications of vertical farming in a rapidly populating and changing world\nAmong the development of alternative agricultural practices, vertical agriculture provides a promising solution for many of the challenges facing current agricultural policies. However, for vertical systems to be integrated on a larger scale requires further technological progress and economic investment.\nNevertheless, gradually implementing more verticality, or combining it with other practices aiming for more sustainable practices may be promising. For instance, the combination of verticality with other practices such as intercropping may be particularly beneficial for developing more sustainable food systems.\nIncorporating technological progress into vertical systems also holds promise, with automated sensors and machinery able to operate near-independently. Progress in gene editing and plant genome modifications will also allow for faster, bigger, and healthier crops, allowing vertical agriculture to produce more over time.\nThroughout agricultural history, farming systems have typically spread over large spans of land, yet the reduction in arable land, as well as the increase in demand to house growing populations, means that such strategies need to be reconsidered, and vertical agriculture may play a role looking into the future.\nContinue Reading: Benefits of Vertical Agriculture and Hydroponics\n- Beacham, A.

70	How do modern logistics roles impact the bottom line?	Logistics roles directly influence company revenue and efficiency in multiple ways. At the strategic level, directors earning around £78,000 annually oversee logistics units and implement programs to optimize operations. Managers earning £40,000 per year oversee goods movement, transportation, and warehouse organization. Specialized roles like Warehouse Operations Managers (£35,000) and Inventory Control Managers (£28,000) optimize storage operations and inventory procedures. This structure enables continuous cost reductions of 4-5% annually while improving areas like product development and packaging innovation, as demonstrated by leading companies. Furthermore, when logistics teams work effectively together, they achieve benefits like increased profits through maximized productivity and improved ability to predict future demand.	['Implementing World Class Supply Management\nSupply Chain Management is an approach to supply chain management that is meeting with great success at a number of leading commercial companies. Quite simply, Supply Chain Management is a strategic, enterprise-wide approach to selecting the suppliers of goods and services and managing them and the whole value network, from raw materials to final customer use and disposal (Leftwich, Leftwich, Moore & Roll Jr 2004). The key to successful Supply Chain Management is to configure and manage supplier networks to emphasize the purchaser’s competitive strengths.\nTechnical innovation, for example, is vital in information technology. Therefore, computer manufacturers must use suppliers to speed up the rate at which they introduce new products. Packaged goods companies also need suppliers that will help them get their products to market faster, as well as lower their costs. Healthcare providers’ priority is to offer high quality care while lowering the cost. And electric utilities need to work closely with suppliers that can help them meet market-based prices.\nFor example, an automotive manufacturer integrated Supply Chain Management personnel into its product development teams so that sourcing is considered during, not after, development. This integration means development teams constantly consider the cost and manufacturing implications of their decisions, and usually enables suppliers to be brought into the development process, lending their own knowledge and skills to improve design and speed up development.\nOne development team that collaborated with a supplier to redesign an instrument panel was able to cut the part count by 30 percent, halve the number of assembly steps and materials specifications, and shrink development time from years to months. Similar efforts in other areas have enabled the manufacturer to produce two vehicles in the time it takes competitors to turn out one. A leading clothing retailer formed close relationships with a small number of suppliers to redesign its supply chain.\nShipments now arrive at lower cost and up to seven days earlier – a significant advantage over rivals in the fast-moving fashion business. And sound Supply Chain Management helped a defense company discover that many of its engineers had for years duplicated suppliers’ work in areas such as R&D, parts-engineering support, and quality audits. The duplication, inevitably costed into the final product, amounted to an unnecessary 7 percent “tax” which, once discovered, was easy to eliminate.\nThe company’s engineers now take on higher value-added tasks such as value engineering, giving it an edge over competitors that have yet to look for similar overlaps. How can other companies emulate best practice? The industry is moving too fast and requires the speed and insight that can only be delivered if the Supply Chain Management organization is working well with all other functions. Supply Chain Management needs to be carried out by a company’s best and brightest people, which calls for better training, job rotation, and recognition that Supply Chain Management can be part of an attractive career path.\nMany purchasing departments do not have the right people to undertake a radically new approach to Supply Chain Management. To find people with the skills to design, build, and manage a supplier network, one industrial company has established a summer associate Supply Chain Management program for students from leading business schools, while a leading computer company requires all new engineers to begin their careers in Supply Chain Management. The demand for new talent is reflected in compensation.\nAnnual compensation levels are now equivalent to those for a general manager running a business, meaning $200,000 salaries with 20 to 40 percent of compensation linked directly to performance. The success of purchasing transformation lay in a compensation strategy that put purchasing on a par with sales and marketing, and which is flexible enough to reward personnel according to the strategic importance of the impact they achieved. The head of Supply Chain Management is now often known as the chief procurement officer – and any company that has searched for one knows how difficult it is to land a top candidate.\nSupply Chain Management Team that includes Team Leader, Procurement Advisor, Demand Planner, Industry Research Advisor, Technical and Quality Leaders, Cost/Financial Support, Materials Management Leader put all their energy into what they do best, in the process reaping benefits such as lower costs, reduced development time, improved service and quality, and access to new technologies, skills, or market information Leftwich, Leftwich, Moore & Roll Jr 2004).\nOnce a network is configured, the flow of information within it has to be managed. Supply Chain Management personnel are at the hub, gathering information from customers and suppliers and passing it around the organization. Their goal is continuous improvement. They work with suppliers to identify cost cuts and areas of mutual growth, and with key users within the company to discuss sourcing issues. They also regularly assess suppliers, aiming to spot glitches before they become serious problems.\nWhat is surprising, however, is that many executives still believe the benefits of better Supply Chain Management begin and end with a one-off cost reduction, essentially achieved by telling their purchasing departments to lean on suppliers to cut prices. Those executives would do well to think again. For, properly managed, Supply Chain Management can give companies a network of suppliers capable of delivering the technology, knowledge, products, or service quality that will beat competitors, at the same time as securing ongoing cost reductions. There are many examples.\nA leading fast-food company cut the number of its suppliers so that it could work closely with the remainder to improve their performance. The result has been not only annual cost reductions of 4 to 5 percent over several years, but faster product development and innovative packaging that sees the company now selling its food in unique environment-friendly containers. These examples, and the experience of more than 250 companies in a range of industries and services, reveal the same simple message: companies must define Supply Chain Management more broadly if they are to use it to the full as a strategic weapon.\nIndeed, Supply Chain Management lies at the heart of any successful continuous-improvement program, helping best-practice companies constantly to upgrade their performance at the same time as reducing costs. In other words, Supply Chain Management helps them improve their “spend productivity” (that is, year-on-year cost reductions on goods and services) faster than competitors do.\nLeftwich, James A. , Leftwich, Lynne M. , Moore, Nancy Y. , Roll Jr. , C.

71	What toxic materials are found in wood versus e-waste?	Wood recycling deals with hazardous materials like pressure-treated wood, creosote-treated wood, and painted wood (with restrictions on lead paint). E-waste is considerably more toxic, being responsible for 70% of toxic substances in landfills and containing hazardous materials that can threaten human health and environment, particularly when informally recycled through practices like open burning and acid leaching.	['How to Recycle Wood?\nRecycling wood involves diverting wood debris from landfills and finding alternative uses for it. Through recycling, wood can be transformed into new products or utilized for energy generation, contributing to environmental sustainability and resource conservation.\n1. Collecting Discarded Wood Products\nAt DTG, there are specific guidelines for the types of wood that can be accepted and recycled. Clean wood, such as construction lumber, pallets, and untreated fencing that is ready to be ground, is permitted. Wood loads containing a maximum of 5% painted (no lead), pressure-treated, or creosote-treated wood are also accepted. Chipped trees and branches, as well as brush, stumps, and logs from land clearing without dirt, can be recycled as well.\nAdditionally, we accept plywood, chipboard, MDF, glulam, and pressure-treated, painted, nailed, or glued wood, as long as they are source separated. It’s important to note that pressure-treated wood is not accepted in the source separated wood category. By adhering to these guidelines, DTG promotes efficient and responsible wood recycling practices.\nWood debris is sorted based on its type and quality. This helps ensure that the recycling process can be tailored accordingly. Sorting of wood during the recycling process is typically done in accordance with various wood grades. The specific wood grades can vary depending on regional or industry standards, but here are a few commonly recognized grades:\n- Grade A: High-quality, clean, and untreated wood, often referred to as “clean wood.” It includes solid wood pieces, such as lumber or pallets, without any coatings, contaminants, or preservatives.\n- Grade B: Slightly lower quality than Grade A, but still suitable for recycling. It may include painted or lightly treated wood, plywood, or composite wood products.\n- Grade C: Lower-quality wood, often mixed with other materials or heavily treated. This grade can include laminates, particle board, or heavily coated and painted wood.\n- Grade D: Hazardous material – This includes all grades of wood, including treated material such as fencing and trackwork, and requires disposal at special facilities.\n3. Removing Contaminants\nAny non-wood materials or contaminants, such as metal nails or screws, are removed from the wood debris. This step is important to prevent damage to the recycling equipment and ensure the quality of the recycled wood.\n4. Primary Shredding\nThe sorted wood debris is fed into a primary shredder, which breaks it down into smaller pieces or chips. This shredding process facilitates subsequent handling and processing.\nWhen primary shredding wood, some common contaminants that may need to be removed include:\n- Metal fasteners: Nails, screws, staples, or any metal components attached to the wood.\n- Paint or coatings: Wood that has been painted, stained, or treated with varnish or other coatings.\n- Adhesives: Glue, adhesives, or tape residues that are stuck to the wood.\n- Plastic or rubber: Pieces of plastic or rubber materials, such as packaging or gaskets, that are mixed with the wood.\n- Glass: Small glass fragments or shards that may be present in the wood.\n- Rocks and soil: Small stones or soil particles that have become mixed with the wood debris.\nThe shredded wood material is screened to separate different sizes and remove any remaining impurities or contaminants. This step helps achieve a more uniform product.\n6. Secondary (Fine) Shredding/Granulating into Wood Mulch\nThe wood chips or pieces are further processed through secondary shredding or granulating machines to create wood mulch or other products. Fine shredding ensures a consistent particle size and enhances the suitability of the wood for specific applications, such as landscaping, animal bedding, or biomass energy production.', 'Inappropriate e-waste management is a big threat for the whole world and especially developing countries, where most of e-waste ends up.\nUndoubtedly, recycling is the most efficient way to manage e-waste. This happens because of the content of e-waste which is very valuable.\nBut first, let’s try to understand what is e-waste and how it can be appropriately managed.\nWhat is e-waste?\nE-Waste can be defined as any electric and electronic device or equipment at the end of its life.\nHowever, e-waste can be also considered the equipment that has become unwanted or obsolete.\nCommon e-waste includes:\n- Home appliances, i.e. televisions, DVDs, radios, refrigerators, cookers, air-conditions, microwave ovens, etc.\n- Information technology equipment, i.e. computers, laptops, hard disks, cameras, mobile phones, etc.\n- Common electrical equipment such as light bulbs, etc.\nModern lifestyle and technological evolution have turned e-waste into the fastest growing waste stream. Global e-waste generation is estimated between twenty and fifty million tons per year (20-50 Mtons/year).\nTherefore, the need for appropriate e-waste management is more demanding than ever before.\nE-Waste management and recycling\nRecycling is undoubtedly the most efficient way to manage e-waste.\nApart from plastic, e-waste consists of precious metals, including: gold, platinum and silver, as well as less precious metals such as copper, iron and aluminum, making e-waste recycling a very prosperous activity.\nInformal management of e-waste, can pose serious threats to human health and the environment. This happens because of the practices used during informal recycling, which include among others:\n- manual dismantling with no use of protective equipment;\n- open burning of e-waste to recover the precious metals;\n- open pit acid leaching to separate valuable metals.\nE-waste is also responsible for 70% of the toxic substances found in landfills. This is actually the consequence of recycling only 20% of total e-waste generated.\nIn that way, appropriate e-waste management and especially e-waste recycling protects the environment and human health by:\n- avoiding emissions to the atmosphere, ground and water from the disposal of hazardous materials and substances;\n- recovering valuable metals that can be reused;\n- reducing greenhouse gas emissions caused by the manufacturing of new products.\nE-waste recycling process in steps\nDespite the development of patents or of customized systems, e-waste recycling process can be summarized in the following steps:\nStep #1 – Manual sorting\nE-waste is sorted by hand at its arrival at the recycling facility. At this step batteries and cables of copper are removed for quality check. In addition, toners are removed from printers.\nStep #2 – Manual dismantling\nE-waste is manually dismantled. Aim of dismantling is to retrieve all the parts that compose e-waste. Then dismantled parts are categorized into core materials and components.\nFurther categorization includes separation of items that can be reused or should be recycled through the recycling process.\nStep #3 – Size reduction process\nThis step consists of two phases; the primary and the secondary size reduction processes.\n- Phase #1\nDuring primary size reduction, all materials that cannot be further dismantled are shredded to pieces between four and ten inches. This process is the preparatory step for further categorization of shredded materials.\n- Phase #2\nRight before secondary size reduction, shredded e-waste is spread on a conveyor belt using and automated shaking process. The size of materials is further reduced to less than two inches. Any dust generated during this process is discarded in an appropriate and environmentally friendly way.\nStep #4 – Overband magnet\nFollowing size reduction, magnets remove all ferrous metals such as steel and iron.\nStep #5 – Separation of metallic and nonmetallic materials\nDuring this step metals such as copper, aluminum and brass are separated from the nonmetallic content. Recovered metal can either be reused or sold as raw materials.\nStep #6 – Water separation\nIt is the last step of e-waste recycling process.

73	foundation council vs trustee duties compare	Foundation Council members and trustees have different duties and obligations. While trustees have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of beneficiaries and must follow trust instructions, diversify assets, and act prudently, Foundation Council members have more flexibility. The Council's main duty is simply to ensure the Foundation's objects are achieved. For example, when holding assets like artwork or boats, trustees are often nervous due to their duty to diversify and act in beneficiaries' financial interests, while a Foundation's Council can hold such assets without these concerns. Additionally, trustees must monitor investment performance, while this duty does not apply to Foundation Councils even when investment powers are reserved.	"['What is a Foundation?\nFoundations to be established under the Foundations (Jersey) Law 200[-] (the “Law”) are vehicles for holding assets. They will be incorporated and therefore have separate legal personality. Foundations must be established with one or more objects. With the sole caveat that the objects must be lawful, they can be charitable, non-charitable or a mixture of both. Permissible objects might include, for example, benefiting a particular person or class of persons or carrying out a specific purpose or holding a particular asset.\nA Foundation’s powers will be exercised by its Council, which is similar to a company’s board of directors. The Law will require however that at least one Council Member is registered under the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998 (the “FSL”) to carry on foundation services business of this type (the “Qualified Member”). A further requirement of the Law is that every Foundation has a Guardian. The main job of the Guardian will be to ensure that the Council carries out its functions in order to achieve the objects. It will be possible for a Founder or the Qualified Member to be both a Council Member and the Guardian.\nIf there are beneficiaries of a Foundation, those beneficiaries are not owed duties either by the Council or the Foundation itself. It will also be possible to prevent beneficiaries from having any information in relation to a Foundation. The protection for beneficiaries provided by the Law comes through the requirement for a Qualified Member and the role of the Guardian.\n- Discrete structures for high net worth clients\nCurrently where a family establishes a private trust company (“PTC”) to act as trustee to a number of trusts, the shares of the PTC will typically be owned by a noncharitable purpose trust or by a company limited by guarantee. In future it will be possible for a Foundation to be the owner of the PTC shares. Clients from regions more familiar with Foundations may prefer this. Subject to the creation of a new exemption under the FSL, it will also be possible for the Foundation to replace the PTC and to act as trustee of the underlying trusts.\nJust as Foundations could be used to own PTC shares, the Foundation could be equally useful to own shares of any corporate protector or enforcer.\nThe attraction of the PTC is that family members or family advisers are able to be directors of the PTC. Equally those individuals will be able to be Council Members of a Foundation.\n- The holding of assets which are “wasting” or subject to volatility in value\nIn traditional trust structures, careful drafting of the trust instrument is often necessary where the purpose of the trust is to hold a single asset such as a business, artwork, an aeroplane or a boat. Given the trustee’s duty to diversify, act prudently, and in the best (financial) interests of the beneficiaries trustees are often nervous about holding such assets. Foundations may become the preferred vehicle for such assets. It will be possible under the Law to establish a Foundation specifically to hold such an asset and the Council (with its Qualified Member) will not be subject to the same duties as trustees referred to above. The Council’s duty (and indeed ultimately the Guardian’s) will be to ensure the object of the Foundation (namely the holding of the asset) is achieved.\n- A Foundation for Discretionary Distributions\nClients may want to incorporate the type of appointment and advancement provisions which are typically found in discretionary trusts into a Foundation. Accordingly, the Regulations would be drafted on the basis that the Foundation’s assets were to be held for the benefit of a class of beneficiaries, with the Council (or the Guardian or some other third party such as the Founder) having the power to select from within the class (or indeed to add to or exclude from the class) who and when benefits might be provided.\n- A Foundation for Charitable and Non-Charitable Purposes\nIn certain jurisdictions such as the U.S., it is common for high net worth clients to use Foundations for their charitable and benevolent giving. Given that Foundations under Jersey law can be created for both charitable and non-charitable purposes (and the flexibility the Law allows in respect of the drafting of the Charter and Regulations), it is apparent that Jersey has the opportunity to market its Foundation to clients in jurisdictions such as the U.S. and mainland Europe.\n- Reservation of Powers\nFrequently trust deeds will be drafted with an express reservation of powers in the hands of the settlor of the Trust (or a third party of his choice), the most common power to be reserved being that of investment. It will be possible for powers to be reserved to a Founder of a Foundation as well. Alternatively, powers can be reserved to the Guardian or indeed any other person depending on the Founder’s preference. The attraction to using a Foundation as opposed to a trust where the power to direct investments is to be reserved is that the overriding duty to monitor the performance to monitor the performance of the investment to which a trustee is subject is not one to which the Council of a Foundation will be subject.\n- An Executive or Supervisory Role for the Guardian\nAs stated, each Foundation must have a Council containing a Qualified Member and a Guardian. The Guardian’s role is to ensure that the Council is carrying out the objects of the Foundation. However, it would be possible to limit the powers of the Council and to reserve to the Guardian the most significant powers. In this way, the Guardian would have an executive role. An attraction for potential clients is that the Founder (or his appointee) could be the Guardian. Alternatively, we have seen other Foundation structures, in which the family, through a corporate Guardian, would have a supervisory role only, whereby they can oversee the actions of the Council; this could be achieved by requiring the Council to obtain the Guardian’s consent before exercising a particular power.', 'A trustee is a person or company appointed to manage a trust and property held in that trust. In legal jargon, a trustee is actually the person or company that holds legal title to all trust property. This basically means the trustee is the person on paper title for real estate, which in turn means that the trustee is the correct person or company to sign a deed transferring property out of the trust.\nPublic Land Records\nEach state has created its own specific way for managing public records relating to land transfers. Generally, each state appoints a county land records officer to keep track of all real property conveyances within that county. When property is transferred to a trust, that property is actually transferred by deed to the trustee. To keep the land records accurate, the trustee will need to sign the next deed conveying property back out of the trust.\nA trust agreement is a complicated legal relationship involving the trustor, the trustee, and one or more beneficiaries. The trustee holds only ""legal"" title to the property and the beneficiaries hold what the law calls ""equitable"" title. As a result, the trustee only has authority to transfer trust property as provided in the trust agreement instructions. The trustee\'s title to the property is always limited to the provisions of the trust agreement.\nBreach of Fiduciary Duty\nA trustee is a fiduciary to the beneficiaries of the trust. This means the trustee has an obligation to act in the best interest of the beneficiaries and to always follow the trust instructions. If a trustee transfers property out of the trust without the beneficiary\'s permission, or in contradiction to the trust instructions, then the beneficiaries may sue the trustee for breach of fiduciary duty. To avoid this problem, a trustee should always examine the trust instructions before signing a deed transferring any property out of the trust.\nMost trust agreements grant the trustee a certain level of discretion regarding the trustee\'s rights and duties to manage, invest and distribute the trust property. In exercising that discretion, the trustee may transfer property as an investment strategy, or the trustee may transfer property as a distribution to a beneficiary. Either way, the trustee has legal capacity to sign a deed conveying that property out of the trust.\n- ""Real Estate Finance Law""; Grant S. Nelson and Dale A. Whitman; 2008\n- Fidelity Investments.

74	cover protect rv during winter storage what type material why	The RV should be covered with a breathable material during winter storage. While it's important to protect against snow and critters, using a breathable tarp is crucial because non-breathable materials can trap moisture underneath, leading to mold and mildew growth. For additional protection, it's recommended to put rags on sharp corners to prevent the material from ripping.	['How to Winterize Your RV\nThe end of the camping season is here and winter will soon be upon us. For all you RV campers out there, you know that means! You will need to start considering winterizing your RV. It can be a long and arduous task, but these tips from http://www.wikihow.com/Winterize-an-RV can help make the job easier.\nArguably, the most important step is draining the water and drying the water lines. The last thing you want is to find burst water pipes next spring!\nHere are the seven steps you should take when performing this task.\nAllow all water to drain from the fresh water holding tank. To drain the water from your RV, you’ll need to open the petcock. What is a petcock you ask? Well, it is a small valve used for draining. Make sure that you don’t drain the water heater yet. This can’t be done until after you add antifreeze.\n- Next you should drain the black and gray holding tanks. You should also flush the tanks while you are at it. If your RV does not come with a built-in system, you should clean the tanks out with a wand or a product designed to clean both of the tanks. Take all of the tanks’ contents to a local dump station.\n- Open all cold and hot water faucets in the RV. This includes those for the sinks, toilet and shower. If you don’t air can’t come out the other end. Make sure you flush the toilet a few times to ensure that all the water is gone.\n- Attach a compressed air adapter to the water lines. Another term is a “blowout plug” and can be purchased at almost any hardware store. The proper place to attach it is the “Water Intake Fitting”.\n- Use a standard air compressor to blow air through the lines. The air from the compressor will force any water left in the lines out. The pressure should be 30 pounds per square inch. This will help keep your antifreeze from being diluted.\n- Replace caps on the drains and close all hot and cold water faucets and also close the petcock.\n- Finally, detach the compressed air adaptor and the compressor from your RV.\nThe next step is to add antifreeze to the plumbing system. There are three ways you can do this: from the inside using a water pump conversion kit, from the outside with a hand pump, and with or without a bypass. For the sake of demonstration, the water pump with a bypass will be used. Without a bypass you would have to add much more antifreeze. As a reminder, do not drain your water heater before adding the antifreeze.\nDisconnect the water line that connects the fresh water tank to the fresh water pump. Attach the pump upstream of the water tank. This means the antifreeze will go in before the tank.\n- If possible, bypass your water heater. This will save you gallons of antifreeze. This is not necessary, but this makes everything much simpler. To bypass the water heater you need to turn off the water heater and disconnect the water supply. If installing for the first time, disconnect the hot and cold lines going in and out of the water heater. Connect the bypass, following the instructions on the package and close off the same hot and cold lines and open the bypass.\n- Place the disconnected end of the waterline in a jug of RV antifreeze. Be sure to use the pink kind, not the green kind because the pink kind is for RVs, which is generally regarded as safe. The green kind is toxic. Approximately two to three gallons of antifreeze should be enough to fill the RVs’ entire plumbing system provide a bypass is installed. If you don’t have the bypass, you need as much antifreeze as the water heater can hold, usually 6 to 10 gallons.\n- Turn on the fresh water pump and allow it to run as it pulls the antifreeze into the plumbing system of the RV. Alternatively, use a hand pump connected to the city water hook up.\n- Start with the highest and work to the lowest point in the fresh water system. You’ll probably start at the kitchen sink. Turn on the hot faucet and run it until it turns pink, then run the cold faucet until it turns pink, too. The general order is kitchen sink, bathroom sink, shower, toilet and outdoor shower. Run each of these until you see a strong shade of pink. You may need to flush the toilet several times until the antifreeze comes out at a steady rate.\n- Pour about three cups of antifreeze into the toilet and into each drain. This includes the washing machine, ice maker and outside water. Be sure to remember those. The specifics of your RV will need to be considered. Refer to your manual for more specific guidelines.\n- Take the water line out of the antifreeze jug and reconnect it to the fresh water tank.\n- Locate the water heater, remove the plug and drain it. This is always done last.\nThe final step in winterizing your RV is completing the final details. By this time you are probably wondering if you will ever get done. Don’t worry, we are almost there.\nRemove all food, laundry and valuable items. This should be an obvious step, but it can be hard to remember with everything else that has to be done. The last thing you want is an exploded two liter of soda all over your refrigerator or your laundry covered in mildew or even your favorite watch missing until the spring.\n- Fix everything that’s broken. Another obvious step, but also one that can be overlooked. Your RV is going to be sitting and stewing for awhile, not good for any machine or human for that matter. To make sure it makes it through, fix everything now. You will be glad you did.\n- Cover all vents and holes. Hopefully you already have some type of mesh guard for your exhaust pipe to protect against mice but make sure all the vents and holes are covered now. You don’t want birds, rodents or bugs making your RV home. Check the entire RV for places that critters may be able to get in to. Just because you’re using it, doesn’t mean they should get to.\n- Take the weight off the tires. If you leave that much weight on one side of the tires, they could grow weak over time, so leave your RV on blocks, which takes the pressure off the tires.\n- Cover the RV with a breathable material. While you don’t want snow and critters getting into your RV, you also don’t want mold and mildew to start growing underneath your tarp. You may want to put rags on top of the sharp corners of your RV, so the material doesn’t rip.\nHere are a few more tips to help you: Most RV part stores will have the supplies needed to winterize an RV. Your owners’ manual will have information about the preferred method of winterizing your particular model. Be sure to open the pressure relief valve when draining the water heater. Allowing the water to drain while under pressure or heated can lead to injuries. Never use automotive antifreeze in the lines of an RV as this can cause damage to the plumbing system.\nSome of the items you will need include pumps, bypass kit (which is optional), minimum of three gallons of antifreeze, tank cleaning wand, tarp of breathable material, air compressor, adaptor (blowout plug)\nSo there you have it, how to winterize your RV. Now that wasn’t so hard, was it?', 'How to Winterize an RV?\nRVs or recreational vehicles have been a constant favorite of American vehicle owners for a long time now. These vehicles range from smaller single person RVs to large luxury styled vehicles with endless amenities.\nHowever, owning a vehicle of this size means that a significant amount of time is required to keep it in shape. And with winter at our doorsteps, RV owners need to know the various effects which cold can have on their vehicles and also how to counter the process.\nSo, if you own an RV and need to take steps to protect it from the dreaded effects of the oncoming winter, here are a few things that you must do.\nStart from the outside. The outer shell of an RV is as important as the machinery packed inside it and if the outside freezes it can easily affect the engines and the pipes. Start off with a thorough cleaning procedure of the entire outer cover of your RV and spot any cracks or dents, no matter how small.\nThese cracks will need to be sealed using any automobile adhesive. Once done, wash the entire RV, dry it thoroughly and Company sure that it is well covered during the storage period. This will stop the RV body from freezing and not allow the cold to seep inside.\nIf you are new to the world of RVing, then you need to understand that these vehicles have a more complex water distribution system than most others, and the heating process is done through this piping system.\nIf an RV is left during winter with water still in the pipes, the water is going to freeze and eventually crack the pipes. To stop this from happening first refer to the manual which comes with the RV since not all RVs follow the same process of winterizing water pipes. Some of the bigger RVs which house systems are running on water such as a dishwasher or a washing machine have much more intricate piping systems and therefore just using an antifreeze solution will not suffice.\nTo apply the antifreeze, drain the entire water from your RV. Leave all faucets on and ensure that every last bit of water is flushed out before the antifreeze is applied. Pour it into the drainage systems and Company sure that it is present in all the pipes up to the faucets. Company sure only to apply non-toxic antifreeze solutions to ensure safety.\nFor those who will be setting aside their RVs for the winter and also those who might use it but have to park it out in the snow, removing the battery is a must. Once again pay close attention to your RV’s manual, and in case the battery cables are not sufficiently marked, Company sure to get it done by a professional so that later on you can do it yourself.\nBatteries should never be stored on a concrete floor as this may drain the power from them, and since they will need to be stored for over two months Company sure that the storage is dry and warm.\nIf you have a single battery RV, then this process should not be much of a hassle. But if you own one of the larger luxury RVs with multiple battery systems, this may be a tedious process. And in case removal and storage cannot be an option Company sure that the cables and especially the negative cables are removed from the battery when the vehicle is parked out in the open overnight or for a long period of time.\nAC filtering Systems\nThe outlets of the air-conditioning systems usually get choked up with a lot of dust over time. While this accumulation is not a big deal as long as it is cleaned from time to time, but during winter it can turn into a real problem.\nThe dust particles on the AC filters can freeze and choke up the entire system. And while RV owners do remember to check their air-conditioning during winter and run it from time to time to ensure nothing is wrong, forgetting to clean the filters before trucking it away can lead to ruin.\nProtection from Mold and Mildew\nWinter does not come alone; rather it brings forth a series of hostile conditions and these may affect your RV anytime. So, it’s not enough to have your guards up against the cold. Winter means higher levels of moisture, and if this moisture can manage to seep into your vehicle’s mechanisms and set off a mold outbreak, you are going to end up spending huge amounts to have it removed.\nLuckily there are dehumidifiers readily available, and you should use them about 3-4 times during the entire season to ensure that the moisture does not get to collect itself in the interiors of the vehicle. For added protection, you can fill the RV interiors with moisture absorbing materials or solutions such as Damprid.\nCovering the wheel\nNow that you have ensured that both the exterior and interior parts of the RV is protected from the cold and the snow, it’s time to take care of the wheels. And this becomes important so that when Spring finally arrives your RV should be able to power up instantly and not have to gas the pedals to heat up the wheels which have adverse effects on both the wheels and the engine.\nYou can cover up the vehicle including the wheels with a trampoline to ensure that snow doesn’t get collected in the crevices of the wheel. But since this can trap moisture and ruin the piping, ensure that the tarp is a breathable one.\nKeep in mind that protecting individual parts of the RV from the cold is as important as taking steps to cover up the entire vehicle. Unless you own high-end luxury RVs, usage during winter is not advised, but in case you have to it’s better to take precautions before heading out on the road.\nCheck This Awesome']	['<urn:uuid:b98f0a69-1dba-4a39-86bc-c4cbe695d4e9>', '<urn:uuid:fc509ee6-5546-4724-bae4-70ef8b0d1736>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	10	57	2304
75	what important get best quality voice commands speech recognition on devices	Good voice recognition starts with good acoustic design. Microsoft tests components both individually and within the whole system, focusing on aspects like frequency response, total harmonic distortion, dynamic range, acoustic seal, sensitivity and noise floor. After this hardware testing, they perform full system qualification with added processing. The final step is testing voice recognition and sound quality, which can take up more than 50% of the time due to its iterative nature. This thorough process helps ensure optimal voice recognition performance.	"[""If there’s one thing the digital age has made clear to us all, it is that our experience with products is everything. Gone are the days of studying instruction manuals; as each new iteration of our cherished devices reaches our hands, we expect a leap in their intuitiveness. And at the same time, we expect them be more pleasing: faster, more capable, quieter.\nFor Microsoft, leading this progression requires top sound quality in everything we hear and whenever we speak. When you hold a Surface™ tablet in your hands, every ‘bong’ that informs you a window has opened affects your perception of the device. While videoconferencing with colleagues through a Surface Hub screen, you expect clear voice transmission – wherever you are in the room. And when using Microsoft’s speech interface Cortana®, she must respond accurately to your voice commands.\nNatural language interfaces are a major part of Microsoft’s vision for the future. The company’s world-leading brains are hard at work on human/machine interfaces that feel so natural and effortless that they essentially disappear. “The most natural human communication mode is speech and language – all over the world,” says Hundraj Gopal, Principal Human Factors Engineer at Microsoft. “We are finally at an inflection point. We are on the verge of using spoken language as a real and valuable communication interface with technology.”\nBringing the world together requires a dedication to achieving sound quality in the devices we use.\nBeyond machines understanding us, we humans also need to understand each other effortlessly if technology is to become an ‘invisible’ assistant. So in phones and large screen devices alike, Microsoft uses multiple microphones to hone in on our voices with location algorithms. By then separating our voices from the background noise, they can clarify the signal we need – so we don’t strain our ears to hear or raise our voices to be heard.\nA sound foundation\nBeneath such clever programming however, the quality of any audio interface ultimately comes down to its hardware. As LeSalle Munroe, Senior Engineer, Surface Devices says: “Good voice recognition starts with good acoustic design. Our anechoic chambers and test equipment allow us to reliably characterize our microphone and speakers to give us the best chance of meeting our voice recognition goals.”\nFor all hardware devices, LeSalle and his colleagues characterize microphones and speakers precisely. “In general, we test components alone, and then components in the whole system, focusing on raw acoustics like frequency response, total harmonic distortion (THD), rub and buzz, dynamic range, acoustic seal, sensitivity and noise floor,” he says. “Then we do full system qualification with added processing.”\nThe last step is to test voice recognition and sound quality. “This can take up more than 50% of the time, because it is a very iterative process,” says LeSalle. “We investigate the relevant aspects of audio engineering technologies, and map them to human perception, acceptance and annoyance, in order to increase user satisfaction.”\nMuch of Microsoft’s hardware testing takes place in Building 87, on Microsoft’s Redmond Campus. Inside, Cortana gets blasted with precise speech from a Head and Torso Simulator (HATS) or mouth simulator, which she must understand and respond to – whatever the background noise they add. The researchers also test the ability of beamforming algorithms to locate a speaker’s voice – again in quantified background noise. 3D spatialization technologies are tested on HATS to see how effective they are at conveying the audio cues we need to immerse us in authentic sound fields – particularly for the HoloLens augmented reality headset. They also measure sounds such as keyboard and trackpad clicks, to find the most pleasing sounds for a device to confirm our interactions with it.\nWhatever the test, a controlled acoustic environment is critical. Microsoft has several anechoic chambers in Building 87, but with their quietest one, they have gone beyond merely controlled. With a background noise level of –20.6 dB(A) SPL, its noise floor is closer to the absolute lowest sound possible than other anechoic chambers. It even took the Guinness World Record in 2015.\nOne of the core reasons behind the huge effort to make this record-breaking chamber was to test components like humming displays, singing capacitors, rattling components and structural vibrations. “Being able to capture and characterize printed circuit board noise is a huge challenge for us,” says LeSalle. Although such noise levels are often tiny and well below the levels that our ears can detect, they can add up in non-linear ways to make a total noise that is audible, annoying, and interferes with voice recognition.\nGood workmen don't blame their tools\n“We always want to have the best tools available for the job,” continues LeSalle. “Our other anechoic chambers are very good, no doubt. However, we wanted to build one with even better audio capabilities, so we could measure lower levels of sound, a higher purity of sound measurements, and increase the validity and reliability of our measurements – so we can quantify the audio performance of our products at a finer and greater level of detail. The chamber and the Brüel & Kjær microphones and preamps we use allow us to achieve the repeatability we want.”\nIt’s probably no surprise that Microsoft’s engineers are perfectionists. And according to Gopal, it is a pre-requisite. “Top products require a long-term commitment to excellence: top-notch experts from several disciplines and high-quality equipment,” he says. With this recipe for success, Microsoft can be sure the sound performance in their devices is built on the purest data. With precise knowledge of their individual components and systems, and the sharpest algorithms and codecs, they are melting the machine/human divide.\nBut the record-breaking lab is about more than the finest, most reliable measurements today. It’s a stone-built commitment to developing top quality hardware in the future. Because when Microsoft’s researchers are innovating how we will interact with new devices, there’s no roadmap to follow. They must imagine and then build their visions on the best foundations possible.

76	Which protocol better suits low-bandwidth IoT devices - VAB or MQTT?	MQTT is specifically designed for low bandwidth devices and networks, making it ideal for small and low-power devices, while VAB is a more general end-to-end communication medium implementing object-oriented communication.	"['BaSyx / Documentation\nThe Eclipse BaSyx Middleware\nThe BaSyx middleware groups Industrie 4.0 components around an end-to-end communication medium, the virtual automation bus (VAB). The VAB implements an object oriented communication approach that exports all information and services as objects with a unique identifier that are connected to one virtual and homogeneous communication network, even if it is realized by multiple physical networks. The VAB therefore defines five virtual communication primitives that are mapped to concrete physical networks. VAB primitives provide a unified way to access properties and operations of VAB objects in a network and machine independent manner. VAB gateways realize inter-network communication by mapping the communication primitives to network specific telegrams, and this way enable end-to-end communication. Gateways furthermore may be used to integrate legacy devices by implementing a VAB interface for them.\nThe graphic below illustrates an architecture overview of the BaSyx middleware and its various components:\nBaSys 4.0 compliant systems consist of the following core and optionally extended components:\n|Plattform Industrie 4.0 compliant components|\n|Asset Administration Shell|| An Asset Administration Shell is a ""standardized digital representation of the asset, corner stone of the interoperability between the applications managing the manufacturing systems. It identifies the Administration Shell and the assets represented by it, holds digital models of various aspects (submodels) and describes technical functionality exposed by the Administration Shell or respective\nassets."" (Details of the Asset Administration Shell, 2018, p. 13, )\n|Asset Administration Shell Submodels||""A Submodel defines a specific aspect of the asset represented by the Asset Administration Shell. A Submodel is used to structure the virtual representation and technical functionality of an Administration Shell into distinguishable parts. Each Submodel refers to a well-defined domain or subject matter. Submodels can become standardized and thus become submodels types. Submodels can have different life-cycles."" (Details of the Asset Administration Shell, 2018, p. 46, )||Core|\n|Registry||The BaSys 4.0 Registry enables registration and lookup of Asset Administration Shells within defined system boundaries. Entities that provide Asset Administration Shells including their submodels may register and hence enable other participants to find them. The necessary information required for registration amongst others are unique identifiers for the Administration Shell and her respective Asset, endpoint information regarding the Asset Administration Shell\'s API and their submodel service provider.||Core|\n|Discovery||The BaSys 4.0 Discovery is a service that uses the registry to find Asset Administration Shells and Submodels. It provides additional functionalities to discover Asset Administration Shells and their Submodels based on filter criteria. These criteria are more advanced than a regular query parameter. The discovery service may provide indexing and/or crawling mechanisms to cache results from queried elements resp. find deeper information when searching.||Core|\n|Control component||Control components realize BaSys 4.0 conforming service based Industrie 4.0 interfaces to assets. Assets may be devices, e.g. PLC controllers, sensors, actuators, but can represent any asset that realizes services or provide information, which also includes for example human workers. Control components provide a service based interface with callable services that e.g. drill a hole into a work piece. They define how a specific service is implemented, but do not decide about the orchestration of services, i.e. a control component does not decide when and if a particular service is called.||Core|\n|Group component||Group components implement higher-level services that use services of other control and group components. Similar to control components, group component services provide the implementation of services but do not decide about when and why a provided service is invoked. Service callers are other components that orchestrate services.||Core|\n|Virtual Automation Bus||The virtual automation bus (VAB) is our implementation of an end-to-end communication for Industrie 4.0. It maps one communication semantic with five primitives (create/retrieve/update/delete/invoke) to different networks and protocols. This way, the VAB can bridge networks via gateways, and can also integrate legacy devices into the virtual end-to-end communication network.||Core|\n|Device integration||Device integration components are VAB components that are part of devices and communicate with the VAB. Device manager components for example connect native status data to VAB objects and upload Asset Administration Shells (AAS) and Sub Models of their device to AAS servers.||Extended|\n|Gateway||Virtual Automation Bus protocol gateways bridges communication networks to enable inter-network communication. Every gateway needs to provide a mapping of all of the five BaSys communication primitives to its supported protocols to enable end-to-end communication. Gateways can be cascaded to bridge multiple networks.||Extended|\n|Strategy / Optimization||The Strategy/Optimization component calculates production plans and production schedules that define when, and on which machine a production step for a specific product will be executed. This component is usually a domain or plant specific application component. Strategy, optimization and monitoring components are highly plant specific. These components use provided interfaces of other BaSys 4.0 components, but are not required to provide defined BaSys 4.0 interfaces.||Extended|\n|Process control||The process control component executes the production plans that the Strategy/Optimization component did create. Eclipse BaSyx will integrate for example the open source Activiti BPMN engine as process control engine.||Extended|\n|Monitoring||The monitoring component enables the monitoring of the production process. It for example collects and aggregates data for analysis or pushes selected and aggregated data to a dashboard.||Extended|\nIn addition to these components, BaSyx users may add other application specific components that connect to the network via an exposed endpoint depending on the communication technology (HTTP, OPC UA, BaSyx native) used.\nBaSyx Identification Naming Convention\nBaSys provides a unified way to identify types and instances regardless whether it is an information model (Submodel, Concept Description, Data Element, etc.) or an asset type resp. asset instance. These identifiers can be used as unique identifier for Asset Administation Shells and Assets as well as for semantic references within the meta-model elements of the Asset Administration Shell:\nBaSyx defines interfaces for all components contained in the architecture overview above. Interfaces are well-defined descriptions of the interaction pattern (contract) and the necessary information models (payload) for the interaction between communication participants. All BaSyx components define at least an HTTP/REST interface on middle-ware and application level. On field device level, OPC UA as well as native BaSyx/TCP are applicable for component interfaces.\nCompliant implementations of BaSyx components need to implement at least the interfaces depicted in the following table. BaSyx provides reference implementations for core components that are necessary to create and deploy an Industrie 4.0 solution.\n|Component||Provided Interfaces||Available Technologies|\n|Control component||BaSyx control component API||OPC-UA, BaSyx native|\n|Group component||BaSyx control component API||OPC-UA, BaSyx native|\n|Gateway||Gateway||Any to any|\n|Asset Administration Shell||BaSyx Asset Administration Shell Service Provider API||HTTP-REST|\n|Asset Administration Shell Submodels||BaSyx Submodel Service Provider API||HTTP-REST|\n|Registry||BaSyx Registry API||HTTP-REST|\n|Strategy / Optimization||---||HTTP-REST|\n|Process Control||Process management, Process execution||HTTP-REST|\nEclipse BaSyx implements the following ready-to-use components:\nAsset Administration Shell & Submodel Providers\nAsset Administration Shell and Submodel providers provide generic Virtual Automation Bus objects, Asset Administration Shells, and/or Submodels with a defined ID on the network.\n- CFG Submodel provider\n- RAW AAS/Submodel provider\n- SQL Submodel provider\n- XQuery Submodel provider\n- under construction: XML AAS/Submodel provider\nReady-to-use reference implementations of the BaSyx Registry API enable Industrie 4.0 components to register their Asset Administration Shells resp. users/applications to find those in a BaSyx compliant manner.\n- Pre-compiled Registry (Local, Cloud & On-Premises via Docker)\n- Simple File-based Registry (Local & Docker)\n- SQL-based Dynamic Registry\nVirtual Automation Bus Providers\nLow-level providers provide generic Virtual Automation Bus objects and do not make an assumption on the structure. Thus, all types of objects can be offered by such a provider.\nControl Component Templates\nBaSyx SDK Architecture\nThe documentation of the BaSyx SDK architecture is provided on its own documentation page.', 'Simply connect your systems to MQTT\nThe MQTT protocol is a widely used protocol in the IoT (Internet of Things). MQTT works according to the publisher/subscriber principle and operates via a central broker. This means that senders and recipients have no direct connection, but the data sources report their data via a publish and all recipients interested in certain messages (identified by the “topic”) receive the data because they have registered as subscribers.\nIn the industrial environment there are many sensors as publishers and superimposed systems as subscribers. In contrast to OPC UA, the data content of messages remains unspecified and is specified by the publisher. In OPC UA, on the other hand, the structures of the communicated data are predefined.\nWith the OPC Router as MQTT subscriber you can use data from MQTT Publisher and pass it on to any system via the other plug-ins (OPC UA, SAP, SQL Databases, Email, REST, etc.). As a MQTT publisher the OPC Router can send data from non-MQTT-enabled sources to a broker to provide any MQTT subscriber with data.\nSee also our Step by Step tutorials to connect the leading IoT platforms via MQTT:\nConnect to the Azure IoT Hub with the MQTT Client\nConnect the AWS IoT Cloud via MQTT\nConnect the IBM Watson Platform via MQTT\nThat’s how easy it is.\nThe MQTT Client Transfer object allows you to send messages as a publisher. The configuration of the broker is done in the instance of the plug-in. The Topic and Payload fields are transferred to the transfer object.\nWhen the transfer is completed, the data is sent to the broker and thus transferred to the subscribers.\nThe XPath or JPath plug-ins can be used very well to structure the data in the payload.\nThe MQTT Client Plug-in provides an MQTT trigger to activate connections.\nThe MQTT trigger is a subscriber for a certain topic (wildcard possible) on a broker. If a message is received, the trigger will provide the topic and the payload in the connection.\nThe browsing of topics is not provided in MQTT protocol. For this reason, the MQTT Client Plug-in does not offer browsing.\nMQTT Client Plug-in Application Examples\nIoT and Cloud Connection\nThe IoT lives from intelligent “things” on the one hand, but also from the comprehensive networking of things on the other. This is achieved by the Cloud and IoT platforms. Most of these platforms have the IoT protocol MQTT as one of their primary interfaces. The data to the digital twins of things is exchanged with the real things via MQTT. The OPC Router with its MQTT client plug-in can serve as a communication partner for these platforms and thus send data from the real world into the platform, but also the way out of the cloud back to the things is possible. What can be regarded as a “thing” from the point of view of OPC Router results from the plug-ins of OPC Router. By combining each of its plug-ins with the MQTT client plug-in, printers, SQL servers, SAP systems and many more can be integrated into the respective IoT platform. Common IoT platforms are for example Amazon AWS IoT (manual for the AWS IoT Cloud connection with MQTT), Microsoft Azure (manual for the connection of Azure IoT Hub with MQTT), IBM Watson, ThingWorx.\nData acquisition from sensors and devices\nThe MQTT protocol has been specifically designed for low bandwidth devices and networks. Therefore, small and low-power devices and sensors are predestined MQTT data sources. With the OPC Router, data from these data sources can be received via a broker and transferred to processing systems such as SQL servers, SAP systems, printers, and others (see plug-ins). Since the MQTT data traffic is bidirectional, data can also be sent to the devices and sensors in this way to make settings or trigger actions.\nExample of an MQTT to SQL Transfer\nData is received from a broker via MQTT client plug-in. The reception activates the trigger. The trigger makes payload available and data is written directly to an SQL table via the MS SQL Server plug-in.\nHere you will find further information\nabout OPC Router and Plug-ins.']"	['<urn:uuid:4feea73b-4869-4a7a-b33c-673e52436d74>', '<urn:uuid:034556f8-6654-45af-98ad-8dc07fb4e152>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	11	30	1938
77	coastal wildlife habitat changes rising sea level threats	Rising sea levels threaten coastal wildlife habitats through a process called 'Coastal Squeeze.' Many islands, such as Madagascar with its unique wildlife (where 70% of animals are found nowhere else in the world) and Sumatra (home to endangered species like Sumatran tigers and orangutans), are at risk. As sea levels rise, marshes and beaches would naturally move inland, but since most coastlines are now 'managed' with artificial structures, these natural habitats are being lost, affecting the wildlife that depends on them. The loss of marshes and beaches also allows larger waves to reach sea defenses, increasing both flooding and coastal erosion.	['There are many islands on our planet Earth that vary in many factors like size, geography, climate, flora and fauna. It is assumed that there are about 2000 islands located on different Oceans. We are listing ten largest Islands in the world that are located in different part of the world.\nLargest Islands in the World\n1. Greenland Island\nIf you ask me what is the largest island in the world?, then the answer is Greenland. Greenland with a total area of 2,130,800 square kilometres is the largest island in the world. It is located between the Atlantic and Arctic Ocean. Greenland is the territory of Denmark. The 80 percent area of Greenland is covered with ice and glaciers. There are only 57600 persons living in this island. There are no roads connecting the towns of Greenland.\nThe Greenland has second largest ice sheets in the world just behind the Antarctica.\nImage Source: Feedback Positivo\n2. New Guinea Island\nThe New Guinea Island exists in the western pacific ocean and it is the second largest island with an area of 785 square kilometres. The island comes under two countries. The western part comes under Indonesia, and eastern part comes under Papua New Guinea. The New Guinea Island has a vast deposit of Gold and Copper.\nThe New Guinea Island has a maximum number of beautiful bird species that exist on this earth.\n3. Borneo Island\nThe Borneo Island exists in the west mid-Pacific Ocean. This is the third largest island in the World. The Borneo Island is the only island in the world that is administered by three countries. The three countries are Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. The majority of the portion comes under Indonesia. The Borneo Island is the third largest island in the world, and it has almost doubled the land as of Germany.\nThe highest peak in Southeast Asia namely the Mount Kimabalu is located on this island only. The rainforest of the Borneo Island is one of the oldest among all the rainforest.\nImage Source: Wild Frontiers Travel\n4. Madagascar Island\nMadagascar Island exists in East Coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean. It is the fourth largest in the world with the area of 587,713 square kilometres. It is considered that Madagascar Island was formed 88 million years ago by its separation from the Indian sub continent. There is approximately about 250000 species found in this island. The unique fact is that 70 percent of animals found nowhere else in the world. This island is also called an alternate world.\nThe cat-like looking lemurs are only found in the forests of the Madagascar Island.\nImage Source: answersafrica.\n5. Baffin Island\nBaffin Island located in Canada. It is the largest island of the Canada country with 507,451 square kilometres in area. The Baffin Island is extremely cold Island with an average temperature of -8 degree Celsius. Baffin Island is named after the person who explored Britain William Baffin. There are many famous species of animals live here like Polar bears, Arctic wolves and lemmings.\nThe Baffin Island has two National Parks namely Sirmilik and Auyuittuq. There are many glaciers lie in these national parks.\nYou can also read: Top 10 Best Islands in Greece To Visit\nImage Source: sidetracked\n5. Baffin Island\nSumatra Island located in Indonesia. It is the fifth largest island in the world with 480,848 sq. Kms of land. The Sumatra Island is also the second largest island in Indonesia. Sumatra Island has very frequent earthquakes and Tsunamis. The reason behind is that Island is located at the subduction zone of Indo-Australian and Eurasian tectonic plates.\nThe most region of the island is covered with the dense rainforest. The Sumatra Island is also home to many endangered species. The species are Sumatran tiger, Sumatran orangutan, Sumatran Rhinoceros and Sumatran Ground-cuckoo.\nImage Source: Indonesia-tourism\n7. Honshu Island\nThe Honshu Island is the largest island of the Japan. It has a wide area of 225,800 square kilometres. The island is also unique since it covers 60 percent of the land cover of Japan. There are five important cities of Japan that come under this island. They are Tokyo, Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama and Osaka.\nThe Honshu island is the second most populated island and one of the largest Islands of the World after Java. Japan highest mountain Mount Fuji is located on Honshu island only. It has largest lake of Japan namely Lake Biwa.\n8.) Victoria Island\nThe Victoria Island is located in Canada. It is the second largest island of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. It has a total area of 217291 square kilometres. The Island was explored by Thomas Simpson, who is also known for explorer of Arctic region. It was discovered in 1838.\nAs the name suggest, the Island was named after Queen Victoria. According to the 2006 census, only 1875 human live on this vast island.\nImage Source: Vancouver\n9. Great Britain Island\nThe Great Britain Island located in The Northwest of the European continent and considered as one of the largest Islands of the World. It has an area of 209331 square kilometres which is making it the largest island in the Europe and ninth largest in the world. It is part of three regions England, Scotland and Wales. The Great Britain has pleasant and nice weather throughout the year. The Great Britain is also the most populated region of Europe.\nIt is considered that Human inhabitation started 500000 years ago on this Island.\nImage Source: Vladi-Private-Islands\n10. Ellesmere Island\nThe Island is located in the Nunavut province of Canada and one of the largest islands of the world. It has a total area of 196,236 square kilometres. It is third largest Island of Canada and tenth largest Island in the world. The Ellesmere Island comprises of many ice fields and mountains. It is considered that Ellesmere Island has remains of last Ice age.\nThe Ellesmere Island has the highest peak of Nunavut province at an altitude of 2616 meters.\nImage Source: Weber Arctic', 'There have been many articles published recently predicting the future extent of tidal flooding and some show an horrific picture. It is important therefore to understand how these scenarios are derived. In simplistic terms we start with a “Digital Terrain Model” (DTM). This is the computer equivalent of a physical model of the land and every pixel is assigned a height. Then you take a “predicted” water level and you ask the computer to colour in everything below that level, which is very similar to taking a traditional Ordnance Survey map and colouring everything below the 5-metre contour.\nAs you will see there are assumptions that need to be understood to decide how useful the map is. Firstly, let’s look at “water level” predictions.\nWater level predictions\nAs we all know the water level around the coast is tidal, with high tides occurring twice daily, spring and neap tides on the Lunar Cycle and bigger springs at the equinox. There are other complicated factors that result in small variations over a longer cycle of 18.6 years. These tidal levels are shown in tide tables and can be predicted many years in advance. As they vary locally, tables are predicted for the nearest major port. However, if you read the tide table carefully you will find notes to the effect that tides are calculated under “average weather conditions” so, “tide table” tides take no account of unusual weather conditions.\nIf the atmospheric pressure is high, sea level is slightly depressed and vice-versa. However, there is a more pronounced effect when the low-pressure system moves at about the same rate as the natural tidal movement, producing what is known as a tidal surge or storm surge. In the case of the Solent, if a depression follows the English Channel it can result in the observed tide being up to about a metre above the tide-table tide.\nThe same low-pressure systems also generate strong winds; hence large waves, and the combined effect of storm surges and large waves can lead to flooding if there are not adequate defences. Surge predictions are produced continuously by the “National Tidal and Sea Level Facility” (https://www.ntslf.org/) and used, in combination with wave forecasting, by the Meteorological Office and the Environment Agency to generate Coastal Flood warnings.\nSea Level Rise\nThere is much talk about sea-level rise, but sometimes with little clarity about what it means in practice. There are two distinct mechanisms that produce a rise in local sea-level, geological (Isostatic) and climatic (Eustatic).\nFollowing the last Ice-age, which covered the North of England and Scotland, the northwest of Britain is rising and the southeast sinking, tipping about a line roughly from Cornwall to the Wash. This is why ordnance datum (ODN) is based at Newlyn in Cornwall, which shows no change. Before 1921 Ordnance Datum Liverpool was used and since Liverpool is rising there are variations between the two. In the Solent area the land is sinking by about 1mm a year, and this is fairly constant.\nThe Eustatic sea level rise has two major components, thermal expansion and melting of ice on land. As the sea temperature increases it expands and so the total volume of seawater in the world increases causing a general rise. As ice on land melts and drains into the sea it also causes an increase in the total volume of water in the oceans and consequently sea level rise. Melting of floating ice does not directly increase sea-level, but unfortunately it does have another effect. As seawater is much darker that ice, it absorbs more of the sun’s radiation and so creates a general rise in the temperature of the oceans.\nRates of Sea Level Rise\nThere are lots of different estimates of sea-level rise, both historically and for the future, but future predictions are only\nestimates and depend on assumptions made, particularly on Greenhouse Gas emissions. Historically, in the Solent there has been a consistent sea-level rise since the last ice-age of about 2mm per year, but there is strong evidence that this has now increased and is currently between 3mm and 4mm per year. In August 2021 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a major report on all aspects of Climate Change. Chapter 9, entitled “Ocean, cryosphere, and sea level change”, concludes that global sea-level rose faster in the 20th century than over the previous three millennia. IPCC estimate that global sea-level increased at a rate of 2.3mm per year at the start of the 20th century but further increased to 3.7mm per year from 1971 to 2018. These are global figures and local factors need to be added. IPCC conclude that by 2050 global sea level is likely to rise by about 200mm (6mm per year) increasing to 600mm (8.5mm per year) by 2100. The further ahead we look, the more uncertainty, as some factors are now impossible to mitigate. We\nneed to plan for these future increased sea levels.\nWe should also plan for flexibility as, with increased understanding, it is certain that the estimates will need to\nbe revised. The Further effect of Sea Level Rise As described earlier, flooding in most of England is caused by a\ncombination of tidal and meteorological events, so sea-level rise does not simply cause flooding, but increases the frequency of flooding. There are other effects which, in the longer-term, are also potentially serious.\nThe natural consequence of rising sea levels would be for marshes and beaches to move inland, however, since Victorian times, most of our coastline has been “managed”. In effect we have a Victorian coastline with a 21st century foreshore. This generally makes it difficult for natural processes to continue with the result that both marshes and beaches will be lost in a process known as “Coastal Squeeze”. This in turn allows larger waves to reach any sea defences and so cause an increased probability of both flooding and coastal erosion.\nWe have all seen the spray which results from a large wave hitting a near vertical seawall, but roughly the same amount of energy is also directed downwards and will erode the beach below. This will continue until the beach is below low-tide level. The same process happens with salt marsh, but in a low-energy environment (smaller waves) over a much longer timescale. The long-term effect, particularly if seawalls are retained in their current orientations, will be the loss of our beaches with all the economic consequences for coastal towns.\nThere is another effect that is often neglected. In all coastal towns the surface water from roads and sometimes rivers, is discharged to sea through sluices or tide-flaps. These allow water to drain out at low tide but stop the seawater coming back at high tide. Consequently, marshes have been drained and in some cases land “reclaimed” to only just above low neap tide level. The marshes at Bembridge are such an example. As the sea-level rises the period over which water can drain reduces and unless there are major changes in the surface and highway drainage systems, for example the installation of more storage or pumps, surface water flooding will occur more frequently. As almost all climate change scenarios predict increases in rainstorms, the combined effect will lead to more flooding, particularly in low-laying coastal towns. Sadly, this effect has not been widely recognised and it is likely that some serious incidents will occur before it is seen as a national priority.\nAuthor – Tim Kermode, TK Coastal, Member of the SPS Council.\nThis article first appeared in the Solent Protection Society Members’ Newsletter, Autumn 2021.\nFor details of how to become a member of SPS and received these articles hot off the press, take this link and get in touch.']	['<urn:uuid:6abbc0ed-e84a-41dc-b39f-ec084299e935>', '<urn:uuid:d7fb9191-7ee3-4cb2-b43d-ac588c8cb889>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	8	101	2291

79	compare kale production salmon vs native fish aquaponics	The salmon aquaponics experiment successfully grew salad plants using water from salmon production, though specific yield numbers weren't provided. In the native fish (Roundtail chub) aquaponics system, kale yields were 0.39 pounds per square foot over 35 days in six-inch pots with fish, which was significantly higher than systems without fish (0.15 pounds) and traditional in-ground growing (0.24 pounds). Both experiments demonstrated that integrating fish and plant production leads to better plant growth through nutrient enrichment from the fish.	"[""Producing salad with water emitted from salmon farming\n14 septembre 2021\nColumbi Salmon, NIBIO, Morefish, and BioMar, have conducted a study which concludes that there is great potential in growing plants in the same system as fish. The innovation supports the UN sustainability goals and Columbi Salmon seeks to realise this system of food production on a larger scale.\nSalmon farming in recirculation aqua systems (RAS) provides the opportunity to produce a large amount of food with small amounts of water. The production emits fish sludge and water used in the production process, which can be used in other valuable forms of production. The concept involves a co-production of plants and aquatic animals, while aquatic organisms contribute to full resource utilisation.\n– We aim to make onshore salmon production more sustainable, through better resource utilisation. The experiment indicates that salmon production can become carbon neutral since the plants are binding up carbon from fish production, through both water and air, says CEO Anders Hagen in Columbi Salmon.\nThe experiment was performed with 1,000 salmon, and by cultivating the salad type «Partition». The production was executed in fresh water, as many plants are sensitive to salt, according to project manager Mari Båtnes Birkeland of Columbi Salmon.\n– We will eventually carry this out on a larger scale. Hence, the satisfying results in this experiment was important to us, says Birkeland.\n– Encouraging results\nThe project was located and performed at NIBIO Landvik's aquaponic plant in Grimstad from December 2020 to May 2021.\n– The salad that was grown in the aquaponics system had an impressive growth. In line with our hypotheses, we saw very encouraging results. Plant production with RAS means that food production can be multiplied using the same amount of water. In addition, we promote sustainable usage and protection of water and marine resources in support of the UN sustainability goals, says researcher Siv Lene Gangenes Skar at NIBIO.\nWater quality, fish welfare, carbon dioxide, and plant quality, are among the factors that were analysed and carefully assessed throughout the trial period. BioMar performed a life cycle assessment (LCA) analysis of the feed given to the plant, and NIBIO performed further measurements of the carbon flow throughout the system. Columbi Salmon’s goal is to become carbon neutral.\n– These analyses were compiled into a mass balance that accounts for all that is added and taken out of the system. This process gave useful insights and results, which we will make use of in our future work, says Gangenes Skar.\nWill link technologies together\nHowever, scaling up a recirculating aqua system, where fish and plants coexist in the same water, may create conflicting interests between fish and plant production. Furthermore, the process may struggle to be economically sustainable. Therefore, the study investigated how to make feasible this type of food production on a larger scale, without affecting current fish production. The solution involves designing a new production system.\n– We want to look at other options to connect new environmental technologies, so that onshore salmon production can become more sustainable in the future. Further utilisation of the resources and opportunities from both forms of production will provide a new approach to a new industry, says Ole Nordal, business developer at Columbi Salmon, and adds:\n– The results from this experiment enable us to take the next step towards a full-scale production plant that can grow salad or other vegetables in water stemming from onshore fish farming. This way, we utilise valuable resources that would otherwise be wasted."", 'Final report for FW20-367\nFlagstaff, Arizona is a growing city with an increasing demand for local produce. Despite the city’s steady growth, farms and producers in the region remain scarce. This is largely the result of limited and expensive farmland and poor soil, forcing many growers to be creative with small plots. From an ecological and sustainable standpoint, it can be difficult to grow in Flagstaff, as there are limited water resources, making water conservation a critical issue. Many communities across the United States face these realities as well. In addition, most native fish species in Arizona are either threatened or endangered. Our project will develop techniques for sustainable and profitable aquaponic growing of a marketable product while assisting in the conservation of rare native fishes. Space efficiency, water conservation, increased crop yields and native fish conservation are the primary goals. We will show the differences in production and water usage in systems with and without fish and compare them to in-ground growing. By rearing Roundtail chub (Gila robusta) in our aquaponics treatments, we will help protect an important native species in our region, while also providing an example for how farmers can help to achieve local and state conservation goals. There are no examples of this type of growing in our community and our project will develop a model for producers to learn about the benefits of aquaponics and rare species conservation. Our results will be shared with the community, schools, and producers through organized farm tours, workshops, presentations and educational pamphlets.\nWe will develop aquaponic growing techniques, with space efficiency, water conservation, native fish preservation, and increased crop yields our primary objectives. This project will develop a sustainable example for growers in land limited, arid regions to produce leafy greens while increasing overall productivity and sustainability on their farms. Using an existing high tunnel, we will design space efficient, tiered systems; these will include tanks for rearing fish and two levels of growing space dedicated for intensive leafy greens production. Our yields from these systems will be recorded and compared to in-ground growing. Fish growth will also be monitored and recorded. These self-contained systems recirculate and reuse water creating dramatic decreases in overall water usage compared to in-ground growing. We will record water usage throughout our project and compare the overall water usage from each experimental treatment. Using aquaponics to rear a native fish species for conservation purposes will provide additional specimens for research and conservation purposes while providing an example of how famers can contribute to environmental or conservation goals. At the end of the project, fish will be provided to the state wildlife agency for use in research or conservation projects in our region.\n- - Producer\n- - Technical Advisor\nOur project consisted of three treatments (each with 3 replicates), an aquaponic treatment with Roundtail chub, an identical treatment without fish, and a separate in-ground treatment using standard growing techniques. All Treatments were conducted in a portion of a high tunnel greenhouse (26ft wide by 72ft long) at Forestdale Farm in Flagstaff, Arizona. For our aquaponic treatments, we constructed six identical artificial streams. These stream systems functioned independently of one another, with half containing fish and the other half without fish. Each replicate consisted of a 200-gallon fiberglass tank (9ft L X 3ft W x 2ft D) which we modified to be safe for fish. In the tanks there was a small magnetic drive pump to circulate water. An additional pump (Evolution ES3500) and bead filter (EBF1000 filter) was set up and used for biological filtration. This pump assembly also had a diverter valve which connected to a screen filter and garden hose for overhead watering. Water was constantly pumped through the bead filters and cascaded back into each tank; when we needed to water we would open the valve to divert the water from each tank. An oxygen diffuser (aquascape pro air pond aerator) was added to each tank to supply extra dissolved oxygen, especially critical for treatments containing fish. These components helped transition the tanks into recirculating artificial stream systems, mimicking natural streams which are suitable for rearing fish. Above each tank we had two tables. One table rested directly on the tank while the other table was slightly smaller and rested 1ft above the tank. Each table was able to hold 6 flats of 4-inch pots (total of 108 pots) and 6 flats of 6-inch pots (total of 36 pots). We recorded the yields of each pot size separately to understand the difference between container size. Each pot was filled with a standardized potting mix, mixed on the farm from coconut coir, perlite, vermiculite, and 1 cup of standardized organic fertilizer per cubic foot. For each treatment an entire table was planted each week consisting of two flats with 4-inch pots and two flats of 6-inch pots of arugula, kale, and lettuce. Once the tables were full, we replanted at each harvest so the system maintained full production. Plantings took place from June-September. Seeding was standardized by weight and direct seeded by hand. After seeding, flats were placed on the lower tables to germinate. After one week the plants on the lower table were moved to the upper table where they remained until harvest 35 days later. Plants were watered from the diverter valve connected to the pump and filter assembly as needed. The valve had a screen filter to catch debris and a short hose with a misting nozzle. Each treatment was kept separate and watered from the individual tanks. Excess water from irrigating drained back into the tanks. Each tank in the aquaponic treatments with fish was stocked with 625 juvenile Roundtail chub produced from broodstock held at the US Geological Survey aquatic research laboratory operated by David Ward in Flagstaff, AZ. Fifteen fish per tank were tagged with a Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) Tag so that an accurate growth estimate could be obtained for fish over the entire growing season. These fish were measured before putting into the tanks and again at the end of the project. Fish were fed ad-libitum daily with a standard hatchery ration of organic fish feed (Aquamax 200 or 600 pelleted feed). At the end of the experiment fish were returned to the US Geological Survey for use in appropriate research and conservation activities. For the in-ground treatment, we dedicated two grow beds consisting of the same square footage as the tank treatments. The in-ground beds were used for intensive leafy green production and planted following the normal protocol of Forestdale Farm. We direct seeded 1 bed of arugula, kale, and lettuce, harvesting at maturity, and rotating and replanting throughout the season. Beds were amended with applications of aged compost in the spring prior to planting. We weighed the harvests from each treatment throughout the season. This data was used to compare the overall yields of each tank treatment to inground growing practices. Water usage was recorded throughout the experiment and compared across all treatments.\nKale Results: Our kale (grown as baby greens) results show that the most productive system was the tiered tables with fish in the tanks using six-inch pots. Over a 35-day growing period these systems yielded an average of .39 pounds per square foot of growing space. In these same systems (tiered tables with fish) four-inch pots yielded similar results with .34 pounds per square foot. Though lower in overall yields, the difference between four-inch pots and six-inch pots was not enough to warrant use of the larger pots (average difference of .05 pounds per square feet). The tiered growing tables without fish yielded significantly less, .13 pounds per square foot for four-inch pots and .15 pounds per square foot for six-inch pots. This is a significant decrease and these systems without fish are not an advisable means for leafy greens production. The in-ground harvest of kale produced an average of .24 pounds per square foot. When running statistical analyses on the data of yields of 40 individual pots per treatment we found that kale results were significant statistically (with a Prob>F of <.0001). Kale growth increased with the addition of fish nutrients compared to treatments without fish (p<.0001, Oneway Analysis of Variance). On average kale production increased by 0.300 lbs. per pot for four-inch pots and 0.302 lbs. for six-inch pots. In comparison to the in-ground plot, kale production with fish nutrients was less pronounced, but still increased on Average by 0.20 lbs./pot, when compared to 6 -inch pots with nutrients. In conclusion, the tiered table set up with fish proved to be the best option and yielded the highest pounds per square foot. Forestdale Farm. Greens Graphs\nLettuce Results: Lettuce yields followed a similar pattern as Kale but with a greater difference between the treatments with fish versus treatments without fish. In addition, with lettuce there was a noticeable difference between four-inch pots and six-inch pots. Over a 45-day period the six-inch pots with fish had an average yield of .53 pounds per square foot while four-inch pots with fish yielded .36 pounds per square foot. This difference is significant enough to warrant the use of 6-inch pots for lettuce production. In-ground average yields were .47 pounds per square foot which is comparable to the six-inch pots with fish. The four-inch and six-inch pots without fish yields were .05 and .08 pounds per square foot. Again the results proved to be highly significant statistically (please see attached graphs for more details). The best method for growing lettuce was the tiered table system with fish using six-inch pots. Forestdale Farm. Greens Graphs\nArugula Results: Arugula followed the same pattern for pot size with six-inch pots with fish yielding an average of .32 pounds per square foot and four-inch pots with fish yielding .24 pounds per square foot. However, (as opposed to kale and lettuce) the in-ground yields for arugula were higher, averaging .38 pounds per square foot. Though the six-inch pots with fish and the in-ground treatments were similar in yields, the in-ground arugula was of a better quality. Even in the six-inch pots with fish the arugula seemed stressed and did not seem to do well in the pots. Arugula was grown over a 35-day period. (Please see attached graphs) In conclusion arugula seems to do better inground then in pots. Forestdale Farm. Greens Graphs\nWater usage: Overall water use per square foot was similar throughout the experiment between all treatments. Looking at the averages for June-August in gallons per square foot per day, in-ground growing used .11 gallons, four-inch pots used .12 gallons per day, and six-inch pots used .10 gallons per day. The real difference comes when comparing water usage to yield per square foot. For example, kale in-ground treatments yielded .24 pounds per .11 gallons while the six-inch pots with fish yielded .39 lbs per .10 gallons of water. To put this in perspective, in the height of summer, it would take approximately 200 gallons more of water to produce 50 lbs. of kale in-ground versus the tiered growing tables with fish using the six-inch pots. Over a growing season this is a significant difference and growers in arid, or water scarce regions should give preference to this type of growing.\nRoundtail chub growth: 625 juvenile Roundtail chub were added to each of the tanks for the replicates with fish. 15-20 fish per tank were tagged with passive integrated transponders (PIT). The total lengths in mm of these fish was recorded at the start and end of the 180 growth trail period. During this period fish growth was an average of 10.9 mm, with a range of 4mm-20mm. Other studies have shown that a 10 mm increase in size for these small chub can significantly reduce predation risk when stocked into the wild (Ward and Morton-Starner 2015). Predation relationships are very size dependent and even small increases in body size can lead to significant increases in survival and reduced predation risk for small fish. Roundtail chub growth Forestdale Farm\nEducation and Outreach\nOur outreach goals were separated into three categories so the depth of information could be shared as suitable for each group. These categories consisted of information directed to the general public, in-depth discussion and presentations for university and school settings, and workshops and discussions for producers. Due to the COVID 19 pandemic we were very careful on the farm, limiting outside contact where possible, and developed safety precautions to minimize exposure and risk on the farm. With safety in mind, we limited public tours and workshops to small groups. We had two small tours early on in the season to discuss the project with interested public. In order to reach a larger audience, we decided to put together a detailed video about the project to be shared with the general public. This video was filmed in three parts to give the whole scope of the project. The first part was early in the experiment at Forestdale Farm and highlighted the set up and the experiment as a whole. The second part took place at USGS research facility where David Ward discussed Arizona native fish and the importance of conservation. The last part was filmed at the farm a few weeks later when the growth of plants in the project was clear and results were starting to come in. This video served to introduce the project and highlight the research that was being done. We shared this video with our community, universities, cooperative center, and other relevant organizations along with a brief survey that people could complete after watching the video. We also shared it with our email list, and on our FaceBook and Instagram accounts. We had lots of interest and positive feedback from the video and it proved to be a great way to reach a large audience in our community. The other main event for sharing project information with the public consisted of a reporter and photographer from Flagstaff’s local paper, the Arizona Daily Sun, coming to the farm for a tour. This resulted in an in-depth front page “Sunday Centerpiece” article. This article was a great way to get the public interested in the project and resulted in many emails and other productive communications. The public was very excited and provided positive feedback and support of the project. For the next outreach category, university and schools, we had tours with Coconino Community College (CCC) students as well as Northern Arizona University (NAU) students. The first tour was with NAU’s Sustainable Botany Class and we discussed aspects of the project related to their studies, specifically the biology of the systems. The second tour was with CCC’s STEM club, a science and technology club which was interested in starting its own small-scale systems. We went over the more technical aspects of the experiment and discussed the best ways for their class to implement an aquaponic project. In order to provide more detailed information to local growers we reached out to the “Flagstaff’s Growers Coalition” and set up a day for everyone interested to come out to the farm. This was a good way for growers to ask more detailed questions and get the specifics of the project. We went over equipment and set up as well as early results. We kept open communication with any interested growers in the region and followed up via email, Zoom, or phone to answer any questions about the project throughout the season. Some topics we discussed were the overall maintenance of systems, daily operation and troubleshooting, details of fish production, intensive leafy greens production, succession planting, and maximizing yields in small spaces. At the end of the project we presented a PowerPoint about the project and our results via Zoom at the “Small-scale farmers colloquium.”\nEducation and Outreach Outcomes\nGeneral notes on quality: Overall the crops harvested from treatments with fish as well as the in-ground treatments was high quality, suitable for all our sales outlets including high-end restaurants. In contrast, the yields from treatments without fish were more suitable to be mixed with other greens and for CSA distribution or farmers markets sales, and some of the arugula and lettuce was substandard and not sellable. Though the treatments without fish were useful for comparison, especially visually for presentation, they were not profitable for the farm since yields were minimal. For future research it would be more practical for farmers to use a standard organic fertilizer application on the treatments without fish. This would provide them with a marketable crop while also showing how much money can be saved on fertilizer use when incorporating fish into the system. Putting a metric on the cost savings of adding fish would be a powerful education piece for growers.\nGeneral notes on in-ground verses pots: Though in-ground yields were less, the benefit of the in-ground growing is that it is possible to get a 2nd and 3rd harvest on some of the greens, whereas only one harvest seemed possible with the potted plants. However, for the farmer limited on space, the tiered table set up with fish still proved to be the best option. In addition to a higher yield per square foot, this set-up also allowed for the space underneath the tables to be used and speeds up germination of the succession crop. The other benefit is that with individual pots it is easier to harvest smaller quantities. In addition, as soon as crops are harvested new ones can be planted so production can be maximized. With in-ground growing it’s difficult to succession plant until the whole bed is harvested, which makes small on-demand harvests more difficult. More research in the benefits of intensive, container-based growing would be beneficial and useful for small farmers.']"	['<urn:uuid:2c075deb-0825-4ceb-ab0b-f31ad81e31cd>', '<urn:uuid:b1341b79-cf37-4e41-9033-d246ddfef385>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	8	79	3533
80	why basic exercises important trained horse	For trained horses, basic exercises serve three key purposes: they help supple and stretch the muscles for more demanding schooling, they help relax the horse mentally and physically by starting at the simplest level, and they allow problems to be resolved at a basic level before they manifest at higher levels.	"['Someone (I think it was Dick Pieper) once said, “If a horse improves 1% every time we ride him, he will be trained in 100 days and we know we cannot expect that!” What this means is: Training a horse for reining is a long, slow process. Yes, indeed. I have been training reining horses for over thirty years and I have yet to find a way to ""finish"" a reining horse in a few months. I plan for at least 18 months on my prospects to get them to a three-year-old futurity and I do not usually show my horses one-handed until they are four, although those who compete in the NRHA Futurity must show in a bridle with one hand and so must prepare for that.\nA reining horse must be relaxed and confident in the reining pen and only a one-step-at-a-time training program will accomplish that. There is no better way to instill confidence and knowledge into your horse than to teach him the first steps first - the ""basics"". The basics are a series of exercises that are the foundation for more difficult ones and basic exercises are an essential part of every training program. Not only do they progress the horse from simple to complex, but are also essential tools to fall back on when the horse encounters difficulty with any advanced maneuver. I go through basic exercises every time I ride every horse from two-year-olds to fully trained horses (at the level they are currently at - I expect more finesse from trained horses; for the youngsters, schooling the basic exercises can take up most of the session).\nWhy are basic exercises important?\n1. When the horse is learning:\n- Basic exercises stretch and warm a horse’s muscles, preparing him physically for riding.\n- Basic exercises are the simplest level of training of the step-by-step program that best teaches any horse.\n- A horse can only learn a high level maneuver, such as the spin, by first learning the maneuver in its simplest form - a combination of the basics.\n2. When the horse is trained:\n- Basic exercises supple and stretch the muscles for the more demanding part of the schooling session.\n- Starting at the simplest level relaxes the horse mentally and physically.\n- Problems at the basic level can be resolved before the rider encounters them at a higher level. Often there won’t be a problem at a higher level if it is dealt with at a basic level.\nWhat are the basics?\n1. Forward motion.\n2. Give to the rein.\n3. Give to the leg.\nHow do I teach basic exercises?\n1. Correct rider position.\n2. Clear signals, or rider aids.\n3. Repetition – the same message the same way every time.\n* Training a horse is encouraging a horse to be comfortable - putting him a position where it is easier to do the maneuver than not do it.\nI am such a believer in building anything step-by-step that I don’t know any other way to write this blog either. I feel I must cover some background before I can deal with specifics so bear with me for a few posts. Also, though Reining Training Tips isn\'t about starting colts - that could be a whole other blog - many tips can be applied to any horse in any discipline at any level of training.\nNext week...rider aids.']"	['<urn:uuid:d2de7caa-2405-41f7-80d5-b7b25e5d6bac>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	6	51	569
81	I have a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old - what's the difference in how they put words together when speaking?	At 1 year old, children start using single words to communicate and enjoy repeating the same word. As they approach 2 years, they begin joining 2 words together like 'mummy car' or 'me go', typically missing words like 'the' and 'is'. In contrast, 3-year-olds can produce longer sentences by putting lots of words together, using joining words like 'and' and 'because'. They also use auxiliary verbs (is, was, has) and determiners, saying things like 'the man is eating' instead of just 'man eating'. They'll also start using past tense and third person singular forms, though they might make mistakes like saying 'throwed' instead of 'threw'.	['Building Sentences – Parents\nLearning to build sentences is an important skill for young children and begins after children learn to link single words together. This takes place alongside their vocabulary development; the two skills are closely interlinked. Children need to know around 50 words before they will be ready to start building sentences – take a look at the vocabulary pages for some ideas.\nYoung children learn to build sentences by listening to others; often this skill develops rapidly after they have learned to link 2 or 3 words together. They will make lots of mistakes along the way and rely on adults modeling correct sentences and sometimes correcting mistakes in a supportive way appropriate to their age and stage of development.\nSentence building provides the scaffold for your child’s on-going language development. Once your child can speak in sentences, they can use language to make requests, comment, ask and answer questions, and a number of other purposes! Children’s sentences become increasingly complex and more detailed as they are exposed to more complex language. The complexities of language include knowledge and skills linked to accurate use of:\n- The parts of language e.g. pronouns\n- Tense linked to their concept of time\n- Formulation of questions\n- Language purpose e.g. clarification, summary, explanation, planning, persuasion\nYoung people also learn to:\n- Explain the rules of grammar\n- Consider the interests of their listener\n- Use intonation to indicate meaning within a sentence or phrase\nNB. Your child will produce longer, more grammatically complex spoken sentences before he/she is able to produce written sentences using these grammatical structures. Sentence building stems from spoken communication with others for a range of purposes.\n- Offer specific praise e.g. “That was a really good sentence. You remembered to use the ‘is’ word”. General comments like “Clever boy” do not help the child to become aware of what he/she did well.\n- Try to avoid anticipating or completing your child’s sentences, which limits his/her opportunity to express his/her self and reduces self-esteem.\n- Discourage others from interrupting whilst your child is speaking.\n- Give your child time to respond – count to 6 in your head after asking a question to give them this ‘thinking time’\nChildren of this age will begin joining 2 words together e.g., more juice, mummy work, eat banana.\nNote: A child needs to learn around 50 words before they can start joining words.\nChildren of this age progress to joining 3-4 words together in a sentence. At this age, it is common for children to:\n- start to use past tense e.g. kicked, clapped.\n- begin to mark possession e.g. girl’s hat, dog’s tail.\n- use regular plurals e.g. cats, dogs, socks.\n- miss out function words such as ‘the’ and ‘is’.\nChildren of this age are producing longer sentences by putting lots of words together and may use joining words such as ‘and’ & ‘because’. They may also:\n- use auxiliary verbs (is, was, has) i.e. “the man is eating”\n- use determiners e.g. “the man is kicking the ball”.\n- increasingly use past tense and 3rd person singular e.g. he drinks, she eats.\n- overgeneralise irregular verb endings e.g. “throwed” (instead of ‘threw’).\nYour child will be able to:\n- Link lots of words together and may use joining words such as ‘and’\n- Ask lots of questions e.g. Why? What? Where?\n- Use the grammatical words (e.g. is, was, has, the, a) i.e. “the man is eating” instead of “man eating”\n- Increased use of verb tenses e.g. he drinks, she eats. S/he may make mistakes such as saying ‘throwed’ instead of ‘threw’, ‘runned’ instead of ‘ran’\n- Use pronouns – his/hers, they/theirs, him/her, ours, himself/herself/yourself/ ourselves\nYour child is able to:\n- Use well formed sentences with more details\n- Use some irregular past tense e.g. “I drank all my milk”, “She took my teddy” but may still make some errors\n- Start to use words: ‘if’, ‘because’, ‘so’, ‘could\n- Show that they can use language to reason and persuade e.g. “Can I go outside because it’s stopped raining?”\nYour child will:\n- Ask lots of questions to find out specific information including ‘how’ and ‘why’ e.g. “How do we know burglars can’t get in?”\n- Use descriptive language to give more specific information in sentences e.g. “Suddenly, he saw a huge hairy creature”\n- Use more complicated grammar and different ways to join phrases to help explain or justify an event e.g. “It was scary because even the man with the dog looked worried, so we decided to get out of there”\nYour child will:\n- Use a wide range of regular and unusual word endings, with few errors being made e.g. Fought, fell, brought, geese, fish\n- Use long and complex sentence structures and more complex joining words to make language flow e.g. ‘Meanwhile’, ‘therefore’ or ‘yet’\n- Use complex grammar and sentences effectively to communicate in different ways to clarify, summarise, explain choices and plan\n- Uses language to reason and persuade\n- Explain some rules of grammar and know when a sentence is not grammatically correct\n- Sentences average about 7-10 words –longer in stories than in conversation\nAsk lots of questions e.g. Why? What? Where?', 'Share this page\nLanguage development in children aged 1-2 years is amazing. Your child will start to understand what you say to him. And by the year’s end, you might even understand some of what he says to you! Here are some of the things you might expect at this age.\nAt 1-2 years, your child will learn to use and understand more words and more types of words. At first she’ll understand mostly nouns – for example, ‘dog’, ‘bus’ and ‘couch’. Eventually she’ll understand a few verbs – for example, ‘eat’ and ‘run’. Adjectives come next – for example, ‘big’ and ‘blue’.\nAt around 12 months, your child will understand the names of things nearby. For example, he’ll understand the words for:\n- common objects like ‘cup’ or ‘doll’\n- body parts like ‘tummy’ or ‘toe’\n- clothes like ‘sock’ or ‘hat’.\nBut your child will use the same word to refer to different things. For example, she might call all animals ‘doggie’.\nAt around 15 months, your child will point to things further away and ask you to name them.\nAt around 18 months, your child will refer to himself by name. A few months later, he’ll begin to understand and use ‘I’ to refer to himself.

And she’ll know what it means when you say ‘no’ or ‘not’.\nYour child will try to make it easier for you to understand him by combining words, gestures and sounds and by changing the tone of his voice.\nAnd your child will enjoy imitating the actions of people around her, and start to understand how to get attention from others by ‘showing off’.\nThis website is a collaboration between Tusla and the Childhood Development Initiative (CDI)']	['<urn:uuid:b9913433-47ab-4308-b8b1-1bbd3265ab78>', '<urn:uuid:0b7bdf47-b67e-4372-bdcd-7624e507c195>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	19	105	1485
82	structural materials strength pine cedar comparison which support more weight roof deck	"Pine and cedar have different load-bearing capabilities. For roof trusses, pine (both white and yellow) is one of the most common woods used, being part of the 80% of new houses using trusses. For decking, both treated pine and cedar of the same thickness have similar span capabilities - at 5/4"" thickness they can span 16 inches, while at 1.5"" thickness they can both span 24 inches between joists."	"['A truss is two elements joined with internal supports to make a stronger and more rigid structure. Trusses may be made of steel, aluminum or other material, but the most common versions are wood. Trusses are the most popular form of roof framing and are used on about 80 percent of new houses. Trusses also may be used to form floors. The advantage of a truss is that its internal, usually triangular, bracing allows it to withstand forces that would damage or break a single board. Trusses must be calculated for the span or distance they will cover.\nThings You\'ll Need\n- Tape measure\n- Span calculator\nMeasure the distance to be spanned across a house or other structure. The span is the distance from one outer wall to the other. Determine the type of lumber to be used. Truss strength will vary among lumber types, such as white pine, yellow pine, cedar or fir, which are the most common woods. It also will vary with lumber grade, such as No. 1 or No. 2 white pine.\nDetermine the spacing of trusses. Trusses spaced 16 inches apart will carry greater loads than those spaced at 24 inches; 24 inches is the normal spacing for roof trusses in a house but conditions may dictate a narrower spacing. Figure a roof pitch or slope; that angle will affect the length of the truss from peak to outer wall, which in turn will affect the strength needed. A truss of 2-by-4-inch lumber for a steep 6/12 pitch that rises 6 inches in 12 feet will cover almost twice the span as on a 2/12 roof, which slopes only 2 inches in 12 feet.\nCalculate the load for the truss. This includes the weight of the roof decking and the shingles. Shingle weight can vary with the type of material and thickness used. Figure a ""snow load,"" using Weather Bureau information about the maximum amount of snow a roof might be expected to bear and wind loads, maximum wind force on a roof. Consult truss tables for variations according to the size of lumber used in the truss; a truss framed with 2-by-6-inch lumber will span about a third more distance with the same load factor than one with 2-by-4-inch lumber.\nConsult local building codes. Most jurisdictions have codes that regulate the size of lumber, the length of truss, the type of internal bracing required and other factors that affect strength of a structure. The codes also will cover floor trusses, which are used in raised floor systems such as pier and beam foundations or on concrete stem walls or basement walls.\n- Photo Credit Hemera Technologies/Photos.com/Getty Images\nTypes of Roof Trusses\nA roof truss is a building material used to frame and support the roof structure of a home.

Floor joists...', 'You’ve decided to increase your living space with an outdoor deck. Now what? What other decisions need to be made to design and build a beautiful and durable deck. First, you need to select your decking. Decking is the most visual part of your decking next to the railing, which will impact your enjoyment of your outdoor living space like no other. But after that, we jump to the structural design of your deck. If it doesn’t stay up, what value is beauty? Leading us to the question of deck joist spacing.\nThree things determine decking joist spacing.\n- The decking’s strength to span between supports.\n- The direction of the decking in relationship to the joist.\n- The joist span between support.\nThe three most common deck joist spacing are 12” (300mm), 16” (400mm) and 24” (600mm). With most deck joist spaced at 16” (400mm).\nWhen determining the correct deck joist spacing, it’s often a good idea to start with 16” (400mm) spacing. The majority of decking is designed for 16” (400mm) joist spacing, thus working with the greatest amount of decking. Also, after walking on and building many decks. Decking supported by 16” (400mm) spacing just feels sturdier than larger spacing. So, for me, it’s a question of does the decking need increase support, but if your budget is tight, 24” (600mm) may be an option. But evaluate this spacing against the decking span strength, direction of decking and required joist span strength. It is ensuring a strong, durable deck.\nBecause joist spacing and decking are so closely linked, if you haven’t already selected your decking, it would be wise to at least narrow the field down to wood or composite. Then slightly further with what type of wood or composite decking.\nIn short, decking material thickness determines the span\nOften more material equals greater strength. There is a correlation between decking thickness and joist spacing. Treated S.P.F 2×6 decking can span 24” (600mm), but reducing it to the more common 5/4” decking can only span 16” (400mm). This correlation holds true for cedar, ipe and treated decking. Ipe is a more ridged decking and can span greater lengths as equivalent cedar decking but still the thicker, the larger possible joist spacing.\nWood Decking Joist Spacing\n|Decking Material||Decking Finish Thickness||Decking Span|\n|Treated S.P.F.||5/4”x5 ½”||16”|\n|Treated S.P.F||1 ½”x 5 ½”||24”|\n|Clear & Knotty Cedar||1” x 5 ½”||16”|\n|Clear & Knotty Cedar||1 ½” x 5 ½”||24”|\n|Ipe||1” x 5 ½”||24”|\n|Ipe||1 ½” x 5 ½”||32”|\nOne note about Ipe decking joist spacing, Ipe may be rigid enough to span 32,” but such spacing is unlikely due to deck joist codes. We will get to that later, but for now. As you can see, all wood decking can span 16” (400mm) on centre joist spacing, but increasing thickness allows for 24” (600mm) spacing.\nWith most wood decking, it is safe to design with joist at 16” (600mm) on centre unless decking does not run perpendicular to the joist, we will get to that later. If you want to increase the joist spacing, increase the decking thickness. But with composite decking joist spacing becomes a little more complicated.\nComposite Decking Joist Spacing\nTo start, most composite decking is thinner than conventional wood decking, most being around 1’ (25mm) thick. So, we are already starting off with a thinner material. On top of that, all composite decking is engineered. What I mean is that every decking brand and line may have different levels of rigidity and joist spanning requirements.\nMost composite and PVC decking is designed for joist spacing of 16” (400mm) on centre. There are a few exceptions that you need to check before building your deck. Similar to wood, the less material in the decking either through scallops or thinner decking, less then 1” (25mm), the closer the joist will need to be.\nMany jurisdictions require technical data sheets to be provided for the decking to pull a permit. As not all composite decking is the same, and there are too many variations for inspectors to know all the individual requirements.\nIn Calgary, where I build decks, this is the CCMC listing number. Unfortunately, even though it’s a government website and the information is for free, it is only available to professionals. Which if you’re willing to adjust during the permits process, bring the decking number, and you can adjust decking or joist spacing after they confirm the spacing. Not official data, but often the manufacturer will also provide the required joist spacing.\nIn the United States, ASTM D7032 Label is the standard. In short, everything designed in a lab must be tested in a lab to know its strengths and properties.\nHere is a chart of some popular composite decking and their required joist spacing. These are there maximum design spacing, but many will even suggest on their own websites that reducing the spacing will increase the firmness of the decking. Especially on hot days, the plastic in composite decking will become very soft and flexible.\n|Composite Decking||Perpendicular Joist Spacing||45° Joist Spacing|\n|Trex all lines||16” (400mm)||12” (300mm)|\n|TimberTech Twin Finish||20” (510mm)||16” (400mm)|\n|TimberTech Terrain, Legacy||16” (400mm)||12” (300mm)|\n|Azek||16” (400mm)||12” (300mm)|\n|Cali-Bamboo||16” (400mm)||12” (300mm)|\n|Dura-Life||16” (400mm)||12” (300mm)|\n|Envision Composite Lumber||16” (400mm)||12” (300mm)|\n|Veranda||12” (300mm)||8” (200mm)|\n|Dekorators Decking||16” (400mm)||12” (300mm)|\n|Fiberon||16” (400mm)||12” (300mm)|\nAngle decking reducing joist spacing\nAs the chart shows, joist spacing needs to be reduced if you change the direction of the decking. This is the reality for both composite and wood decking. I find that you have a little more play with wood decking, but it must still be considered.\nA little trick of geometry. By changing the direction of the decking, you are actually increasing the distance spanned between the two joists. A 45° angle increases the decking span by 1.414. Changing 12’ (300mm) into 16” (400mm). If the maximum decking span is 16” (400mm), the deck needs to be joisted 12” (300mm) on centre. The equivalent decking span.\nDecking requiring 16” (400mm) on centre joist spacing, you will need to reduce the spacing depending on the degree of the angle of the decking. The smaller the degree in relationship to the joist, the greater the joist spacing will need to be reduced.\n|Angle of Decking||Space Between Joist||Nominal Joist Spacing|\n|30°||8 7/8” (225mm)||8” (200mm)|\n|45°||13 ¾” (348mm)||12” (300mm)|\n|60°||15 ¾” (399 mm)||14” (350mm)|\n|90°||17 ¾” (450mm)||16” (400mm)|\nDecreasing Deck joist spacing to Increase Joist Spanning\nBoth the International Residential Code and Canadian Wood Council adjust joist spans based on joist spacing. Decrease the joist spacing increases the deck’s strength allowing greater spans. When using 2×8 S.P.F. joist, the CWC increases the allowable joist span from 10’2” (3.09m) at 24” (600mm) on centre to 12’0’ (3.65m) span by reducing the joist spacing to 16” (400mm). If you reduce the joist spacing in a third down to 8” (200mm), the 2×8 joist can span 15’1” (4.6m).\nAllowing you to reduce the number of concrete footings required by increasing the number of deck joists.

83	what benefits comes with environmentally friendly home design health money community	Living sustainably brings multiple benefits: people with sustainable lifestyles are often healthier and more connected with their communities. From a housing perspective, sustainable homes are more efficient in using water and electricity, which makes them cheaper to run. They also provide better comfort through features like proper orientation, cooling breezes, and effective shading, while being less wasteful and having a lower environmental impact.	"[""Who wants a sustainable lifestyle? Well actually quite a lot of people, apparently. Far from being a niche concept, a major new study on sustainability from the UNEP says the idea is ‘misunderstood as a rich nation choice’.\nWhile the desire to enjoy western living standards is strong, the study picks out a range of sustainable living ideas being developed across the world. It says one of the biggest barriers to more people achieving them may be how we celebrate and communicate these ideas.\nMost definitions of sustainable lifestyles talk about three key areas; minimal environmental impact, not undermining the carrying capacity of resources (i.e. using only those that are renewable or replaceable over time) and helping people interact with the communities and places in which they live.\nBut, as the UNEP study points out, 'people will only change their lifestyles in exchange for a better one', so perhaps a fourth point could be just as important: making them desirable.\nSolitaire Townsend, co-founder of sustainability consultancy Futerra, says making them desirable may be easier than we think. She points to some of the activities that people trying to live sustainably become involved in, such as cycling and changing the way they eat.\n‘People living sustainable lifestyles are often healthier, they’re more connected with their communities,’ she says. ‘There are also many desirable aspects of a sustainable lifestyle which are hidden, such as sleeping better and spending more time with your kids, which we don’t focus on.\n'We focus on the environmental boundaries rather than on the social desirability.’\nPoor image of sustainability\nThe UNEP study says much of the communication around sustainable lifestyles has tended to be from environmental groups and government and either 'prescriptive, patronising or disapproving'.\n'Rather than turn people on to the vast opportunities and enjoyment sustainable lifestyles can bring, they have turned people off,' says Townsend.\nWhat’s lacking, she argues, is a vision. ‘Nobody aspires to live a policy. People aspire to what they can see, feel, touch; something tangible. We don’t have a passionate, eloquent, visual description of sustainable lifestyles, so people don’t know they want them.’\nFuterra's 'Sell the Sizzle' report, taking its name from a salesman’s advice to ‘sell the sizzle’ rather than the sausage, argues that while the science may be what policymakers want to talk about, it is not what people want to hear about.\n‘For years we’ve tried to ‘sell’ climate change, but a lot of people aren’t buying,' Townsend says. 'Threats of climate hell haven’t seemed to hold us back from running headlong towards it. We must build a visual and compelling vision of low carbon heaven. And this vision must be desirable.\n‘If [it] isn’t more desirable than what we’ve got now then why bother reaching for it?’\nReaching a bigger audience\nHowever, creating a single 'desirable' vision of a sustainable lifestyle won't be enough on its own, according to Dr Michael Peters, from the Research Group on Lifestyles Values and Environment (RESOLVE) at the University of Surrey.\n‘Initiatives that attempt to connect with people and engage in more sustainable ways tend to attract people who are already ‘switched on’ environmentally, so there’s a big barrier in connecting with people for whom environmental issues are not a key priority,’ he says.\nPeters says that in some cases the peripheral benefits of lifestyles that exert less impact on the environment should be highlighted, such as the savings that can be made by running an energy efficient household.\n‘If the moral environmental argument doesn’t resonate, then perhaps the financial savings could.’\nOthers believe that the issue goes deeper than simply selling the benefits or desirability of a sustainable lifestyle - the biggest barrier of all may be social pressures and how we measure a happy and successful life.\nIn the industrialised world especially, this tends to be gauged in terms of material wealth. The traditional yardstick is that of consumption, typically viewed as an indication of well-being and wealth by economists with GDP regarded as the last word in measuring progress, development and prosperity of a society.\nBut, as the UNEP study on sustainability points out, GDP is not a reliable indicator of happiness or satisfaction. A quick look at the New Economics Foundation's (NEF) Happy Planet Index reveals that those countries with the highest GDP are not ranked as the happiest.\nIn fact, the top ten countries are all Latin American or Caribbean (bar Vietnam), with Costa Rica topping the ranks. Rich industrialised nations fall somewhere in the middle – the UK ranks 74th behind Germany, France and Italy, while the USA is way behind at 114th out of 143.\nJuliet Michaelson, a researcher at the NEF, agrees that the perception of what drives happiness presents a barrier to people living sustainable lifestyles.\n‘As long as signs of success, both individually and at a societal level, are to do with material possessions and wealth then there is a big incentive to gear our behaviour towards producing those things,’ she says.\n‘Those things are not the biggest driver of well-being. Things such as your social relationships have a much bigger role to play.’\nMichaelson says more people than we think may already have moved beyond the policymakers' definition of progress. She points to a public poll by market researchers GfK NOP from 2006 where 81 per cent of people supported the idea that the Government’s primary objective should be the greater happiness not the greater wealth.\n‘Eight-one per cent is not just one section of society so it’s not just a middle-class thing.’\nTim Cooper, Professor of sustainable design and consumption at Nottingham Trent University, says there is already plenty of evidence of people taking decisions which improve their quality of life over their income, such as working part-time. But he worries that momentum may be lost by a lack of enthusiasm for sustainability among current politicians and policymakers.\nThere have been concerns that green issues will be ‘downplayed’ across Government following the scrapping of the well-respected watchdog, the Sustainable Development Commission (SDC).\nProfessor Tim Jackson, author of the groundbreaking ‘Prosperity without Growth’ report for the SDC, agrees that there is alarm about whether the progress made over the past decade will be lost. However, he says that the reaction of the devolved administrations – the Welsh Assembly Government in particular was outraged at the SDC decision – suggests that the understanding and prioritisation of sustainability is growing.\nHe also points to Defra’s now annually published Sustainable Development Indicators as evidence that some parts of Government are at least able to think about measuring progress using something other than GDP.\nProfessor Cooper agrees, but says things need to go further. He worries that most Government departments are still stuck with ‘old-fashioned’ views of economic growth.\n‘There is that potential out there - people don’t always maximise their incomes - but that seems to be the only message the Government seems to be able to give. If it did take a slightly different approach and gave a nuanced message that might help people move.’\nHe points to education as the key sector and says sustainability should be embedded across the school curriculum, ‘at the moment we train them for society as it is rather than a vision for how it could be,’ he says.\nUNEP: Task Force on Sustainable Lifestyles\nDefra's Sustainable Development Indicators\nEconomic growth has let us down. What's the alternative?\nTim Jackson's new book, 'Prosperity Without Growth', is an explosive indictment of the failure of economic growth to provide sustainable wellbeing for the world's population. But there could be another way forward...\nSticking with GDP could be the best safeguard for nature\nAlthough much maligned as a measurement of progress, some believe a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measurement that includes natural capital could be the way forward\nBiodiversity 'invisible' in current economic model\nThe steady loss of forests, soils, wetlands, fisheries, species and coral reefs around the world is closely tied to the lack of value we put on nature, says three-year study\nFace it: orthodox economics messed up\nIn drowning out the voices of those economists that don't adhere to neoclassical orthodoxy, the current global financial collapse was inevitable\nGoodbye to growth\nThe contraction of the global economic system bodes nothing but good for global ecosystems.

84	How do the communication needs differ between a guided tour of the Ascarate Garden's accessible features and hosting an indoor educational presentation about accessibility?	For an indoor educational presentation, communication needs focus on providing assistive listening devices, captions for audio-visual content, interpreters if needed, and materials in accessible formats like Braille or large print. For the Ascarate Garden tour, the focus is more on having guides who can explain the physical adaptations and accessible features of different garden beds, while being trained to assist people with various abilities and describe visual elements for blind participants.	['by Penny Leslie, Beverly Clark, and Ignacio Muñoz, El Paso Master Gardeners\nMost gardeners agree that gardening is good for the mind, body, and spirit. However, for many people completing gardening tasks in a traditional way is difficult due to physical, cognitive, or emotional challenges. Fortunately, there are countless ways to adapt the gardening environment. As part of our vision to make gardening accessible to everyone, we created a beautiful garden area with multiple examples of garden adaptations.\nOur Accessible Garden within the Ascarate Teaching and Demonstration Garden provides a wide variety of raised garden beds and benches, each with unique details that can be tailored to meet specific needs. We have great handouts and lists of resources with additional information about specific techniques, as well as gardening adaptations and tools that can be used to create further accessible gardening opportunities. If you love gardening but find that health conditions are impacting your ability to get the job done, or if you know people who are giving up gardening or not even considering gardening because of physical or cognitive challenges, adapting accessible gardening techniques may be the answer!\nThe entrance to the Accessible Garden features a beautiful sign painted by Master Gardener Alison Wells when she was an Intern. Also shown mounted on the entrance posts are information boxes like those which are posted throughout the garden and contain information on accessible gardening.\nThe Accessible Garden project was the vision of Master Gardeners Penny Leslie and Beverly Clark. It was constructed through the collaboration of Master Gardeners, Interns, and even an El Paso Community College student earning Community Hours. The endeavor was a long process due to the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic which forced our gardens to shut down in March 2020. It was after the second shutdown in October that the project was completed with a few touch-ups that were completed in January 2021.\nMaster Gardeners Can Help You Learn More:\n- Creating an Accessible Garden\n- Accessible Garden Design\n- Safety Tips\n- Ergonomic, Enabling and Adapted Tools\n- Stretches for Gardeners\n- Disability Specific Accessible Options\nGet in the Know:\n- Resource Lists\n- Personalized Group Presentations\n- Adaptive Tool Samples\n- Help Desk Assistance\n- El Paso Master Gardener Website\n- Tours of Ascarate Teaching and Demonstration Accessible Garden Area\nThis rectangular raised garden bed features a resting bench where people can take a break from working. It can also be used for people to sit on while working from the bench. The garden bed can be accessed from all sides. With the recessed lower edge all the way around for people’s feet to go under, gardeners can move in close and work from a comfortable position.\nThis split barrel raised garden bed was constructed by cutting two 35-gallon barrels in half and mounting them on a frame which splits them into four different containers for planting. Drainage holes were drilled in the bottom. It is recommended that plants or vegetables with smaller, not deep roots be planted in this type of raised bed due to the shallow bottoms of the barrels. The raised bed also has a countertop for elbow resting and can be accessed from all four sides.\nThis bench was constructed by building a frame from construction blocks and putting them together with construction adhesive. The bench and backrest are pressure-treated 4 X 4 posts. The bulletin board is weatherproof and will display information on accessible gardening which will be updated periodically. The small golden sign on the side of the board is a dedication sign to honor Penny Leslie’s parents who taught her the value of gardening and helping others. Penny made a generous donation to go towards the construction of the garden.\nThe galvanized metal raised garden beds were purchased through a local supply store. Trellises were added for climbing vines.\nThe keyhole garden beds have easy access from a wheelchair or a garden stool. The wire mesh in the middle of the keyhole garden bed is for compost and vegetable waste, and it has a sprinkler inside of it. The nutrients from the compost in the wire mesh leaches out which helps fertilize the plants and keeps the soil rich with nutrients.\nThe wheelchair-accessible raised garden bed has ample room to accommodate two wheelchairs in its inner recessed area, so it allows two gardeners with special needs to work together at the same time. The raised bed also has access from all other sides and its height allows gardeners to comfortably work from their wheelchairs.\nThis multilevel raised bed offers three gardening heights for gardeners with different abilities. The taller section can easily be reached from a wheelchair or when standing. The shorter section is a comfortable height when using a gardening stool. This multilevel garden bed can also be accessed from all sides.\nThe vertical barrel garden bed, in the foreground, provides many options for planting a variety of different vegetables in a small space. The plants are watered from the inside of the barrel with water coming into the top of a pipe that runs\nto the bottom and has holes for water to\nspray inside the barrel.\nThis is an overall view of the Ascarate Accessible Garden. The pergola in the background has inside benches so it can be used as a resting place after hours of gardening. You can also meditate and enjoy all the beauty and joy that comes with gardening which helps you relax as you become part of Nature and Mother Earth!\nPhotos by Ignacio Muñoz, El Paso Master Gardener', 'Ensuring access to meetings, exhibits, performances, tours, festivals, and other types of events requires forethought and preparation. Such events are often held in locations, including outdoor venues, which present challenges related to facilities and terrain. Additionally, there are issues, such as communication or transportation, which may need to be addressed if people with disabilities are to participate in meaningful ways.\nDifferent types of events may also entail different approaches to accessibility. For example, some events are open to the public at large, with no pre-registration required. When planners have no idea who is going to show up, they must prepare for everyone. Other events are for specific, known audiences, and planners can respond to individual needs in a more focused way.\nCommunication and Interaction\nAny type of event involves communication, ranging from advertisements and promotions to presentations and speeches. Promotional information is often disseminated through a variety of media, including radio and television broadcasts, web site postings and e-mail messages, newspapers and periodicals, flyers, and posters. Throughout the course of an event, the multiplicity continues, with speech, audio-visual presentations (slides, movies, etc.), printed materials, signs, and maybe a few banners or flags thrown into the mix.\nEvent planners know that using multiple communication methods helps get the word out, facilitates activities and interaction, and reinforces messages and lessons for diverse audiences. Accessible features simply add more tools to the “multiplicity” toolbox. For example, captions can provide access to the “audio” in an audio-visual presentation for people who are deaf or hard of hearing; audio descriptions can provide access to the “visual” for those who are blind or have low vision.\nIt is important to remember that web sites are a form of communication, and web pages often include both visual and audible components, and sometimes interactivity as well (such as online registration forms). Using accessible web design practices will ensure that online features and opportunities are available to web-surfers with disabilities.\nIncluding information about accessibility features and options in announcements and promotional materials can be helpful for both event planners and participants. For example, if assistive listening devices (ALDs) are always on hand at the facility where an event will be held, then including that information in promotional materials will let potential attendees know that they don’t need to call ahead and request them to make sure they will be available.\nIt’s also a good idea to inform people about barriers that can not be overcome. For example, if a tour of an historic home will include an opportunity to climb down a narrow set of steps into an old root cellar, then that information may be of interest to people with disabilities who may not be able to do that. They may still choose to go on the tour to see and do all they can, but knowing what limitations to expect will help people make choices and plans, and avoid unpleasant surprises.\nWhere registration or advanced notice is required to participate in an event, promotional and registration materials should include contact information and a deadline for requesting individualized accommodations that might not otherwise be provided. Interpreters and materials in accessible formats, such as Braille or large print, are examples of things that could be provided on an as-needed basis; a reasonable deadline is needed to ensure there is enough time to order or produce materials, or make necessary arrangements for services.\nPlanners should remember to find out if participants who may not be required to register, such as presenters, performers, or exhibitors, have any disability-related needs.\nAlso, presenters, vendors, guides, or others who may interact with attendees should be informed about accessible elements or services (e.g., where elevators are located, or how to obtain receivers for the assistive listening system) so they can respond to questions or direct attendees appropriately.\nPresenters and other workers should also be given information, training, and support to ensure that they use accessible practices (e.g., describing visual presentation elements for the benefit of participants who are blind, or retrieving items that are out of reach for wheelchair users).\nSites, Facilities, and Vehicles\nWhile it may be difficult (or impossible) to find a “perfect” site for an event, accessibility should be high on the list of criteria to be considered. Whenever possible, site assessments should be conducted by professionals or people with extensive knowledge of accessibility standards and understanding of usability issues.\nIt is important to assess not only an actual facility (for example, a hotel or auditorium), but the surrounding area as well. Consideration should be given to how the site is situated in relation to various modes of transportation that people might need to use. Airports, rail stations, bus systems, taxi or shuttle services, or public parking may need to be checked for accessibility.\nAlso, if people are likely to walk to and from public transportation stops, or to walk to nearby restaurants, shops, or attractions during the course of an event, the neighborhood should be checked for “walkability.” Steep sidewalks (or no sidewalks at all), lack of curb cuts, uneven surfaces, and other barriers can adversely affect people who have a variety of mobility limitations. Low hanging tree branches and other protruding objects, reflecting pools and fountains without walls or edges, and poorly designed street crossings or circulation routes can make things difficult, if not downright dangerous, for people with vision impairments.\nWhen setting up areas where event activities will take place, arrangements should allow enough space so that people using wheelchairs or other mobility aids can maneuver around temporary elements like booths, signs, or tents. Displays and exhibits should be designed so that people can see and/or reach items from a seated position.\nWherever possible, seating arrangements for training sessions, performances, or dining should facilitate opportunities for integration by providing wheelchair seating spaces in more than one location. Dispersed wheelchair seating also makes it easier to ensure that wheelchair users are able to take advantage of the full range of available options, such as different lines-of-sight.\nWhen transportation is offered as part of an event (e.g., a shuttle from a remote parking lot to an event area), vehicles must be accessible, or other suitable options must be available (e.g., accessible parking located adjacent to the event area).\nFor events that last longer than a few hours, it may be a good idea to find a suitable area that can serve as a “relief” location for service animals. Signs can be posted, and directions and information can be disseminated and announced so that everyone who wants to find the area (or stay away from the area!) will know where it is.\nQuick Facility Fixes\nThere are a number of things that can be done fairly easily, some temporarily, that can enhance accessibility and participation for people with disabilities.\nParking: Where accessible parking is inadequate, or simply non-existent, spaces can be designated temporarily. Pavement tape, barricades, or the ever-popular orange traffic cones can serve to define space for parking and access aisles; temporary signs can be posted. Accessible parking should be located on surfaces that are as level and stable as possible, and connect to accessible routes that lead to entrances, transportation stops, or event areas.\nRamps: Portable ramps can be used to overcome curbs or steps; they must be securely placed or installed so that they do not shift when used. Ramps with drop-offs should always have curbs to keep people from going over the edge.\nDoors: Installing off-set (or swing-away) hinges can add a couple of inches of clear space at a narrow door. Add-on lever hardware can be attached to round doorknobs to make them easier to operate. Where doors are heavy, it may be possible to simply prop them open or even remove them for the duration of an event.\nRoutes/surfaces: There are a variety of products that can be used to create temporary accessible surfaces. These products, including modular or roll-out materials, work well in outdoor environments where natural surfaces consist of grass, sand, or other loose materials.\nDetectable warning devices: Detectable warning devices, such as planters or other heavy objects, can be placed on the floor beneath hazardous protruding objects (e.g., wall-mounted fixtures that project more than four inches) so that people who are blind or have low vision will avoid them.\nSigns: Good signage is often a critical communication component at an event, and can be even more important for people with disabilities, who may need to use alternate routes or find accessible elements. If a facility does not have good general signage in place, consider adding some temporary signs (e.g., “Elevators [with a directional arrow]”). “Event-specific” signs may be needed as well (e.g., “Festival Parking / ACCESSIBLE PARKING ONLY IN THIS LOT). Signs should be easy to see and read, with non-glare finishes, simple lettering, and good contrast between characters and background.\nWhen all is said and done, there may still be a need for assistance or accommodation on an individual level. But then, a little human interaction may be one of the reasons we planned the event in the first place.\nThis article first appeared in the Winter 2008 issue of ADA in Focus, a publication of the Mid-Atlantic ADA Center.

85	famous nascar ceremony master what job	Bill Brodrick, known as 'The Hat Man', was the victory-lane ringmaster for 29 years in motorsports. At 6 feet 3 with swept-back hair, orange beard, and designer shades, he directed post-race celebrations, orchestrating the 'hat dance'. He managed victory lane activities by directing cameramen, deciding who greeted winners, handling sponsors' hats, and ensuring TV directors got their needed shots. He became so famous he had his own trading card and registered 'The Hat Man' trademark.	['It’s unlikely that many longtime motorsports fans recognize the name Bill Brodrick. It’s just as unlikely that anyone who’s ever watched NASCAR, IndyCar or Formula One doesn’t recognize “The Hat Man.”\nNo surprise there, since Brodrick was the flamboyant victory-lane ringmaster for 29 years, directing traffic and orchestrating the familiar “hat dance” that made him famous.\nA burly 6 feet 3 with swept-back hair, a flowing orange beard, designer shades and rings aplenty, he turned post-race celebrations into performance art.\nHe told cameramen where to stand and when to shoot. He decided who greeted the winner and in what order. He tossed around sponsors’ hats and told crewmen which ones to wear and which cameras were hot. As live television became a force, he ensured that directors got what they needed when they needed it. He became a rock star who signed autographs, had his own trading card and registered “The Hat Man” trademark. He was hailed at speedways around the world and helped the Associated Press at 20 consecutive Super Bowls and during the 1989 inauguration of President George H.W. Bush.\nThe Cincinnati native worked for Union Oil Co. from 1969 until Tosco bought the company in 1997. When the new regime dismissed Brodrick after NASCAR’s 1997 season finale, he retreated to Algonquin, Illinois, to run a tavern near the Fox River.\nBrodrick, 77, recently spoke with Autoweek about his years in racing and his fond-ness for the spotlight that made him famous.\nAutoweek: How did The Hat Man gig in victory lanes develop?\nBill Brodrick: It started during the first part of the ’69 racing season. I was in victory lane with the (Union 76) Race Stoppers, getting publicity shots for the company with the girls and the race winners. I don’t remember the specific race where I began guiding and taking care of things. I was working with photographers and TV people, and I knew a lot of them from my time in radio and as a racing writer. It developed as we went along, as I began directing how things should be done so everybody got what they needed from the drivers and the sponsors and the teams. All of a sudden it was like, ‘Hey, this is working pretty well,’ and everybody liked it. By then, it was maybe midway through that season.\nAW: Certainly you didn’t know that running victory lane would make you an international personality.\nBB: Heavens, no. God, no. I never imagined that. I was just a struggling 30-year-old PR guy getting paid to do my hobby. I was treading lightly, working 24/7 to get the company’s name out there in front of the public. The power of television made me who I became. The nature of what I did—getting drivers out of their cars and getting them and the owners and sponsors in front of the right cameras—got me known. And the fans … they’re the best in the world. They never forgot me and were always happy to see me. They couldn’t always get next to drivers and crew chiefs, but they could always get next to me, and I loved it; they made it all happen for me. I was the luckiest guy in the world because I looked forward to it every day for 29 years.\nAW: Did Tosco ever explain why they let you go?\nBB: No. I had worked for (Union 76) for 29 years and had no idea anything was going to be different in 1998. When I went in two days after the ’97 Atlanta race to renew my one-year contract, I was told I was no longer needed. I really wanted to do another year, sort of a 30th anniversary “victory-lane tour” to say goodbye and thank everybody. I never got that opportunity.\nAW: What is your impression of today’s NASCAR product?\nBB: Frankly, I don’t watch it much, but what I’ve seen is boring. A lot of races are at night, and there are so many options, other things I’d rather watch. I don’t know most of the participants so I don’t have the personal interest I used to. There seems to be too much corporate control, but the corporate representatives don’t seem to be working as hard as we did. I like drag racing because their shows are time-edited and their guys do a fantastic job; they know what they’re talking about. And I like Formula One. It can be boring, too, but I love the technical aspects. I don’t watch much sports-car stuff unless Corvettes are running.\nAW: What victory-lane moment stands out the most?\nBB: Probably Richard Petty’s 200th (win) at Daytona in July of ’84 with President Reagan there. Richard was the best because he knew exactly what to do. I’d give him some milk and a Goody’s in the car, then he’d say, ‘OK, Bill, let’s get them cats squared away.’ The year (1996) Ernie Irvan came back (from serious injuries) to win at Loudon. Anything with Davey Allison and Jeff Gordon because they were always so happy; they enjoyed victory lane. Darrell Waltrip won at Daytona (in 1989) and did that funky little dance, and Alan Kulwicki’s first win at Phoenix (1988). Man, we had fun. There are so many good memories.']	['<urn:uuid:9b00810d-2dca-490d-9981-64585972abe8>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	6	75	877
86	celebrating diwali indian new year compare china red new year celebration what different traditions	Both celebrations feature distinctive traditions involving the color red. During Diwali in India, people decorate with rangolis at their doorsteps, with some regions drawing Goddess Lakshmi's footprints. In China during New Year, people paste red couplets on doorframes and display red paper-cuts. Both celebrations involve monetary gifts - during Chinese New Year, elders give red envelopes (hongbao) with money to children, while in India, Diwali marks the beginning of a new financial year with the Muhurat trading session. Fireworks are important in both cultures - Diwali features firecracker celebrations (though now time-restricted in some places), while in China red firecrackers are used to scare off evil spirits and bring good luck during celebrations.	"['Diwali or Deepawali is India’s one the most important and celebrated festival. The festival of light is the reflection of banishment of darkness around one’s self, both physically and mentally and to bring beauty and light to life. The word “Deep” or “Diya” stand for the earthen lamps that illuminate the light and keep darkness at bay. The word Deepawali is a coinage of two words, “deep” or lamps and “avali” or rows.\nDiwali is not only celebrated by millions of Hindus but also Sikhs and Jains. And there are several reasons of celebration.\n- Return of Rama to Ayodhya after killing Ravana: According to Hindu epic “The Ramayana”, Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya with Lady Sita and his brother Lakshmana after defeating Asura Ravana in Lanka, on a full moon day in the month of kartik. Lord Rama’s birthplace, Ayodhya, celebrated the day by decorating the city with earthen lamps. Year after year this homecoming of Lord Rama is commemorated on Diwali with lights, fireworks, bursting of crackers and merriment.\n- Return of Pandavas after Vanavas and Ajnatavas: The great Hindu epic ‘Mahabharata’ reveals that it was ‘Kartik Amavashya’ (the new moon day of the Hindu Kartika month) when the Pandavas appeared from their 12 years of banishment as a result of their defeat in the hands of the Kauravas at the game of dice called Pasha (gambling). The five Pandava brothers, their mother and their wife Draupadi were honorable, cordial, gentle and congenial in their ways and were loved by all their subjects. To celebrate the joyous occasion of their return to Hastinapura, their subjects, the common people illuminated their kingdom by lighting bright earthen lamps everywhere. And the tradition is maintained to this day.\n- The day Lakshmi chose Vishnu as her consort: According to this legend, on this fateful day when Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, was ‘born’ out of the Samudra Manthan (or the great Churning of the Ocean) and was married off to Lord Vishnu on the same night, the wedding was celebrated by the lighting of lamps.\n- It is supposed to be the day on which Narakasura was killed: Narakasura, a demon king defeated Indra Deva and kidnapped 16,000 women who were the daughters of gods. Satyabhama, Lord Krishna’s wife livid with anger went to war with Lord Krishna as her charioteer. Narakasura previously had been cursed with death at the hands of a woman, and Satyabhama fulfilled that prophecy by beheading him. This victory is celebrated as Narak Chaturdashi during Diwali.\n- The killing of the demons, Shambhu and Nishambhu: Born from the forehead of Durga, Devi Chamunda or Devi Kalika went on to kill Shambhu and Nishambhu, two arusas who had terrorized humans and gods alike. After having killed them, Kali went on a rampage destroying everything and everyone that lay in her path until Shiva threw himself before her. Shocked by the sight, the enraged Goddess stopped in her tracks. The image of her tongue sticking out is Kali in a state of astonishment. Just like Durga, Kali is also worshiped widely in West Bengal.\nThere is another amazing event that is celebrated a day before Kali Puja. It is called Bhoot Chaturdashi or the 14th Day of Ghosts. It is believed that the barrier of the two worlds, the human world and the spirit world, gets thinner on this day and ghosts can roam around all over. Also, this is the day to pray for all the older and deceased generations to be happy. Most believe that it’s the older generations that protects them from the darkness around. And we light diya to keep the darkness at bay.\n- The Harvest Festival: Diwali also falls at the time when Kharif crops are cultivated. A time when rich rice cultivation gives its fruits. India being a agro-economic society, the significance of a rich harvest gives a new meaning to the celebrations.\nSikhs have quite a few reasons to celebrate Diwali. They believe that it is the day on which their third Sikh Guru Amar Das, declared Diwali as the day when all Sikhs would gather to receive the Guru’s blessings. Also another reason is that it was on this day, in the year 1577, that the foundation stone of the Golden Temple, the most magnificent and the most beautiful institution of the Sikhs, was established in Amritsar. Last but not the least, 42 years later, in 1619, the sixth Sikh Guru Hargobind, was liberated on Diwali by Mughal Emperor Jahangir, from Gwalior fort, along with 52 kings.\nJains believe that it is the day on which Mahavira, the twenty-fourth and the last Tirthankara attained the Nirvana.\nIn fact the importance of this festival is deep rooted in the society and economy. On the day of Diwali, the Indian stock market holds an auspicious event, called the Muhurat. Muhurat is a special one-hour trading session conducted on the propitious occasion of Diwali. The session also marks the beginning of a new year or ‘Samvat’ for Gujaratis and Marwaris – two communities that dominate the stock broking sector in India. It is believed that muhurat trading brings wealth and prosperity throughout the year.\nUsually there is a trading session in the evening every year by NSE and BSE to mark the felicitous occasion of Diwali. The broking community holds Laxmi puja and trade during this time. This year it was conducted between 5 pm and 6:40 pm on Wednesday.\nRangoli is an important part of the celebration of Diwali. Rang means colour. The word Rangoli is coined from two words, “Rang” and “Aavali” which means, Row. Just like Deep and avali. Diwali is celebrated across the country, mainly as a festival to welcome goddess Lakshmi. They have a ritual of cleaning their homes, remove all garbage and dirt from the house to welcome the Goddess and decorate the entrance of the house with beautiful rangolis. The rangoli patterns are created using chalks, crushed limestone and rice powder. In different areas of country they have different names like kolam and Aripoma. In West bengal region it is called Alpona which is a bit different than Rangoli. Rangoli uses different colours and it’s just powders on the floor in different shapes while Alpona is white or a little creamy in colour and the colour is mixed with water and drawn on the floor with distinct and intricate patterns.\nIn Bihar and Bengal region, people draw the footprints of goddess lakshmi on the doorsteps of their homes, while in Andhra Pradesh people draw Rangolis with the 8 petal lotus patterns which is known as Ashtadal Kamal. Correspondingly in Tamilnadu, people are known to draw the 8 pointed star, called the Hridaya Kamal, which can be translated as Lotus of the Heart.\nIn any case Diwali is a festival to celebrate happiness and Indians have this amazing way of satiating their appetite to enjoy a festival. And for celebration there are lots of different tasty dishes. Usually there are many types of sweet dishes ranging from laddoos to jalebi to soan papdi to rasgulla to gulab jamun. Everything savoury and delicious as beautiful as the festival is.\nAnd the extended version of the belief of the festival of light is the festival of firecrackers. On this day lots and lots of firecrackers are bursted. However this year, the Supreme Court of India has imposed a time-ban on firecracker bursting. People can light all sorts of firecrackers for only 2 hours a day. Due to constant deterioration of quality of air index in Delhi and increasing pollution, this ban was announced. Also the sound shouldn’t be more than 90 decibels in some places. This is a fair enough decision. The old people and the ill, the animals, both pets and strays and children too will be relieved from the pains of unbearable sounds of crackers bursting to and fro.\nSo now that we know all about about Diwali let us celebrate it to our heart’s content but without hurting others. Let’s illuminate with lights and not sound demons of bursting crackers.\nWish everyone a very Happy Diwali!!!', 'From among a world of colors, red stands out the most. The color red is fresh and pure, and in China, we call it China Red. Chinese people are fascinated by the color red not only because of its intoxicating vibrancy but also because of its rich meaning in Chinese culture and history.\nIt is believed that no country in the world has ever adopted a color in such a thoroughgoing way as China, where red is a symbol that gives color to the soul of the nation. In the past, red stood for dignity and mystery. Even now, we adore the color much more than we love it. It is can be said that \'China Red\' is an eternal theme for China and an essential color for the Chinese people. ""China Red"" has become a quite popular word, attracting the world\'s attention.\nShooting red-colored things in China is an easy task, as its powerful presence can be found everywhere. All traditional red things have been playing special roles in China: the walls of ancient palaces, the national flag, Chinese knot, lantern, couplet, clothes, traditional paper-cuts for window decorations, and even red tanghulu (sugar-coated haws on a stick). Red is the color of the auspicious, signifying reunion, health, happiness, harmony, peace and prosperity. Only real things and events can fully display and explain its beauty. Only in its relationship with people can the color be alive and meaningful. Here we will reveal the cultural significance of China red.\nRed Chinese Knot (Zhongguo Jie)\nChinese knot is actually an ancient art of weaving and Chinese people have used knots as decorations since the Han Dynasty. Now people in China are still intrigued by the secrets and complicated beauty of traditional red knots. ""Knot"" In Chinese has the meanings of reunion, friendliness, warm, marriage, etc, so the red Chinese knot has come to be the symbol of reunion, luck, harmony, and love.\nTraditionally, a Chinese knot must be bent, tied and crafted from a single red rope, to express the endless circle of a happy life. That is the most important characteristic of Chinese Knot. By combining different knots or other auspicious adornments skillfully, a unique auspicious ornament, especially the red-colored which represents beauty, happiness and wishes, is formed.\nToday, Chinese knot has become an important element of international fashion. To fit with the needs of modern life, Chinese knot has various products, most of which are used as auspicious hanging and knitting clothing adornment.\nCombining China red, form and complexity in a very traditional type of harmony, the square-shaped “True Love Knot” is the most famous type of Chinese knot. Instead of the traditional way to pop the question ""will you marry me"", you can choose a light-hearted and humorous way to suggest marriage by giving your sweetheart the True Love Knot, indicating ""Let\'s tie the knot"".\nRed Lantern (Hong Denglong)\nA lantern is closely linked with the lives of Chinese people, as you can find it everywhere, especially during festivals and holidays. If you happen to do Beijing tours in this period, you\'ll see red lanterns hanging on the front gate of houses and stores, decorate the street in a unique way.\nLanterns in China are more than lighting devices and red lanterns are regarded as a basic symbol of the Chinese culture, a symbol of brightness, happiness and reunion. Both the gigantic lanterns at the Tiananmen Square and the small lanterns of a peasant\'s hut express the same warm, happy and joyous atmosphere. You see a red lantern and your mind thinks of China.\nSupposed to warn away evil spirits while brightening the mood with the red glow of good luck, red lanterns are considered a necessity of traditional Chinese festivals. In Lantern Festival (the fifteenth day of the first Chinese lunar month), the preferred warm red of traditional lanterns creates a convivial atmosphere at the family reunion as well as lights up the hope for the New Year. Lanterns, especially the red-colored, deserve adoration for the magical element they add to the atmosphere.\nThe cheongsam is a high-necked dress with distinctive Chinese features. The dress is buttoned on the right side, with a loose chest, a fitting waist, and slits up from the sides, all of which combine to enhance the beauty of the female shape. Easy to slip on and comfortable to wear, the cheongsam perfectly fits the beautiful figure of females.\nThe Cheongsam, especially the red-colored, is one of the most typical, traditional costumes of Chinese women. Even though Cheongsam is not often appearing in daily life, it is worth collecting, for it reflects the Chinese culture and arts with its national characteristics and strong happy colors and fashion designs. That\'s why brides in China choose red cheongsam as their most preferred dress, to perform the traditional Chinese wedding ceremony and create a happy environment.\nThe cheongsam enjoys a long history and is now enjoying a resurgence in popularity in the world of international fashion. Shanghai is the right place to shop this kind of garment. After evolvement and development, Cheongsam has become an inspiration for fashion designers. Regarded as a symbol of the Chinese nation, Cheongsam is often seen worn by women on formal or semi-formal occasions. In either case, it creates an impression of simple and quiet charm, elegance and neatness. No wonder cheongsam is so much liked by women not only of China but of foreign countries as well.\nRed Couplet (Duilian)\nPasting red spring couplet has been an important part of the Chinese New Year since ancient times. On Lunar New Year\'s Eve, families in both urban and rural areas make it a point to decorate their gates or apartment doorframes with the customary couplets.\nThe couplet, written on two strips of red paper, is composed of two poetic sentences which match and rhyme with each other to express hopes for the coming year. The red couplets, along with the New Year paintings on the door, serve as beautiful decorations as well as protective talismans.\nRed Paper-cut ( Jianzhi )\nPaper-cut art is another traditional handcraft created by Chinese people. People cut papers into animals, flowers or people in various patterns. Posted on the window, door lintel or desks for the festival atmosphere, paper cuttings are mainly used for decoration during the Spring Festival to welcome the Chinese New Year.\nIt can be very interesting to learn paper-cut, which is all made by hand. You need only a knife and paper. But, no mistake can be made during the process, otherwise, the work would be a fail.\nDaofu is one of the most popular forms of paper-cutting. The word ""fu"", which means good luck and happiness, is written on a square red paper and often displayed upside down (dao) on doors and elsewhere. The act of turning the word “fortune” upside down is called daofu, which literally means ""Good luck is coming!"" It is not only a play on words but a play with words. A paper-cut class can be arranged in your Xi\'an tours as the following picture suggests.\nRed Firecracker ( Bianpao )\nIn China, to celebrate happy events, firecrackers are set off not only for the color but for the \'Noise\' too. People in China believe that red firecrackers can not only make noises and bring good luck but scare off evil spirits and ghosts with the loud pop as well. The floor is covered by a layer of red color pieces.\nRed Pocket ( Hongbao )\nIt is a tradition in Chinese families for the youngsters to give their elders the following greeting during the 15-day Spring Festival: ""Gong xi fa cai, hong bao na lai!"" which means: ""Wish you a prosperous new year. Give me a red envelope!"" The older members of the family will then give the youngsters a red (for luck) envelope with a gift of money. The elderly may also place the red envelopes under their pillows on the Chinese New Year\'s Eve to give them surprises. The money is wrapped in red envelops called hongbao in Chinese. The custom in China is much like the one in western countries that Father Christmas comes down the chimney and places gifts in children\'s stockings when they are sleeping.\nAs in China color red is connected with good luck, the red envelopes are supposed to protect children from evil spirits. The custom is extremely popular with children. But what they really care about is the lucky money inside the red envelopes, which they can use to buy the things they like.

87	initial setup for cable tower workout	For cable tower exercises, you should set up the cable machine at the highest setting and attach a rope to the cable pulley. Start with light weights and focus on proper form to prevent injury.	['A cable tower exercise machine has weights and cables that can be adjusted to different heights. Women can strengthen their abdominal muscles, including the obliques and lats, because of the twisting and pulling motions of cable rotations. The arms, chest and back muscles also get a good workout from this machine. Start with light weights and focus on proper form to prevent injury and get the most benefit from the workout.\nSet up the cable machine at the highest setting and attach a rope to the cable pulley. Grasp the rope with both hands and stand about one arm-length from the machine. Turn your right side toward the machine and place your feet apart, a little wider than your hips. Turn your torso toward the machine and extend your arms with elbows slightly bent over your right shoulder toward the machine. Squeeze your abdominal muscles to brace for the rotation. Straighten your arms and pull the rope down and across the front of your body as you rotate your torso toward the left. Pull the rope until your hands are down and pointing at the floor on your left side. Hold the position for two to five seconds and then slowly return to the start position. Do 10 repetitions and then switch sides.\nSingle Arm High Rotation\nThe single arm high rotation works the abdominal muscles, the shoulders and the chest muscles. Attach a single hand grip to a cable machine. Set the machine at the highest setting. Stand with your left side next to the machine. Place your feet hip-width apart on the floor. Grasp the handle of the cable rope with your left hand so that your palm is facing forward. Step forward with your left foot. Place your right hand on your right hip for balance and then squeeze your abdominal muscles. Pull the cable with your left hand drawing it straight across your chest toward your right side. Keep your elbow slightly bent as you pull the cable. Do 10 repetitions with each arm.\nSingle Arm Low Row\nAdjust the cable machine to the lowest level. Attach a single-hand handle to the cable. Stand to the right side of the machine and hold the cable handle with your right hand. Turn your body to the left and bend your knees slightly as your body pivots toward the left. The right arm should extend toward the cable machine across your torso. Squeeze your abdominal muscles and pull the cable across your body toward your right hip. Rotate your body until you are standing straight up with the cable pulled across your torso. Do 10 repetitions and then repeat on the other side.\nThe Judo flip cable rotation exercise targets the upper abdominal muscles and the obliques. Connect a rope to the cable machine and set the machine at the lowest level. Stand with your left side toward the machine and spread your legs into a wide stance. Grasp the rope with both hands and pull it over your right shoulder. Hold the rope with both hands at shoulder level. Twist your body toward the left, away from the pulley and down toward the floor as if you are trying to Judo flip the machine over your right shoulder.

88	what impact socioeconomic status education level health literacy patient outcomes readmissions costs	Socioeconomic status, particularly educational attainment, strongly impacts health outcomes. Adults without a high school diploma are expected to die nine years earlier than graduates, and lower education levels correlate with higher rates of obesity, tobacco use, and lack of preventive care. Only 12% of adults have proficient health literacy skills, which is a stronger predictor of health status than other socioeconomic factors. Limited health literacy leads to increased hospitalization rates, higher healthcare costs, and poor health outcomes. Patients with poor health literacy use healthcare services more frequently and have difficulty managing treatment plans, leading to increased healthcare costs and readmissions. For example, patients may not understand how to take medications properly, resulting in frequent hospital readmissions.	"['What are the social determinants of population health, and how can healthcare providers reduce the socioeconomic impacts of community disparities?\nFinancially and clinically successful population health management programs must take much more into account than what happens to a patient while she is sitting on the exam table.\nAs the healthcare system’s responsibility expands beyond the clinic walls and into the community, the need to understand and address the social determinants of health has become a top priority.\nHelping patients to overcome socioeconomic barriers to better health by spending more on community improvements can reduce downstream medical costs, found the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in a recent study.\nStates with a higher ratio of social-to-healthcare spending from 2000 to 2009 saw better patient outcomes.\nA 20 percent increase in the median social-to-health spending ratio was equivalent to 85,000 fewer adults with obesity and more than 950,000 adults with mental illness, the study added, significantly reducing the associated spending on these conditions and their comorbidities.\nBut what are the most impactful social determinants of health, how can providers identify areas of opportunity in their communities, and how can they work with their partners to reduce the negative impacts of socioeconomic insecurities?\nThe World Health Organization defines social determinants as “the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life.”\nEconomic and social policies, political systems, and social norms all contribute to creating the environments in which individuals thrive or experience challenges, WHO says, leaving healthcare providers facing a complex and deeply personalized set of restrictions and opportunities for each patient.\nFew healthcare organizations have the resources or political clout to truly eradicate the larger economic, social, and historical constraints that have led to certain groups experiencing long-term disparities and inequities.\nBut the good news is that population health management programs that address small, manageable pieces of the great American puzzle can successfully change many lives for the better.\nBreaking down the social determinants of health into their component parts can help providers assess their community challenges and implement targeted initiatives that improve the health and wellbeing of patients experiencing socioeconomic disadvantages.\nSAFE AND SECURE HOUSING\nHousing stability is a key indicator of socioeconomic status, affecting both rural and urban populations. For most individuals, housing is the single greatest monthly expense, says the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity.\nSuccessfully making rent or mortgage payments can be particularly difficult for low income individuals who must spend a larger proportion of their earnings on securing their housing situation.\nUnstable housing arrangements can increase emotional, physical, and social stress, present problems with properly storing medications, make it difficult to consistently access healthcare, and lead to gaps or changes in schooling for children that may adversely affect their educational development.\nHealthcare providers can also more easily follow up with patients when they have a stable address and contact information, Johns Hopkins adds.\nProviders can work to reduce the negative impacts of housing instability and homelessness by partnering with supportive housing programs geared towards preventing loss of housing and providing options for recently evicted or homeless individuals and families.\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development offers grants to community organizations looking to create supportive housing to supplement their efforts, while the National Coalition for the Homeless maintains directories of existing supportive housing projects, shelters, and transitional housing initiatives at the local level.\nENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY AND CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING\nMost healthcare in the United States is conducted in English, despite the growing cultural diversity that permeates the vast majority of communities. There are currently 41 million native Spanish speakers in the country, in addition to 3.3 million people who speak one or more dialects of Chinese.\nTagalog, Vietnamese, Hindustani, Arabic, and Korean are also spoken by millions, leaving healthcare providers with the task of ensuring that non-native English speakers can understand directions and instructions that are often very complex, even for those fluent in the language.\nIn 2004, more than 46 million people did not speak English as a primary language, and 21 million additional residents were not wholly fluent. By 2014, more than 60.6 million spoke a language other than English at home.\nThese patients were less likely than others to receive recommended preventive care, more likely to struggle with their medications, and required more visits to the office to meet their needs.\nInterpreter services can be costly, especially for uncommon languages. In 2004, the cost was estimated at $279 per person per year. They also may not fully transcend the cultural barriers experienced by non-native English speakers in the healthcare setting.\nAnd family members who act as translators can increase tensions, reduce the feeling of confidentiality, and present legal privacy concerns for providers, says Mayo Clinic dermatologist Michael M. Wolz BMBCH, JD.\nThe advent of telehealth and mHealth translation services has made it somewhat easier to overcome language barriers. On-demand professionals with proficiency in uncommon languages can reduce the roughly $2 billion spent each year on interpretation services while ensuring access to trained and certified healthcare-savvy translators.\nHEALTH LITERACY AND EDUCATIONAL LEVEL\nIn addition to ensuring that patients and providers are using the same words, organizations must ensure that those words make sense to individuals with varying levels of health literacy and educational attainment.\nAdults with higher levels of education are less likely to engage in risky health behaviors, says AHRQ. And there are dramatic differences in life expectancy strongly correlated with high school and college graduation rates.\nBy age 25, adults without a high school diploma are expected to die nine years earlier than their graduate peers. Life expectancy among individuals with less than 12 years of education has fallen by more than 3 years for men and 5 years for women between 1990 and 2008.\nSource: US Dept. of Education\nEducational attainment is correlated with higher incomes, more social resources and stability, improved healthy behaviors, and an improved ability to tackle social and economic stresses. Individuals who secure stable employment are more likely to live in neighborhoods with access to fresh food choices, higher quality schools for their children, and lower rates of violence and crime.\nHigh school graduates are also less likely to be obese, to use tobacco, to be uninsured, to access preventive care and cancer screenings, and to exercise an appropriate amount, the CDC notes.\nThe “soft skills” learned in school, such as critical thinking, reading comprehension, and social interactions, also contribute to higher levels of health literacy.\nHealth literacy allows patients to understand their conditions and the treatments that will improve their overall wellbeing, yet only 12 percent of adults are “proficient” in the art of understanding their health, according to the National Assessment of Adult Literacy.\nProviders can help to develop health literacy in patients, no matter what degrees they hold, by training their clinicians in how to communicate clearly and effectively while reducing stress and defensive anxiety in the consult room.\nTreating individuals with kindness, patience, and respect while using simple language to explain health issues can help to ensure communication is achieved.\nIf patients cannot physically get to their appointments or access acute care in times of need, they cannot benefit from even the most robust and effective population health management program.\nMissed appointments and no-shows cost the healthcare system billions of dollars each year. One estimate from 2008 says the average cost of no-shows per patient was nearly $200. With a mean no-show rate of close to 20 percent in an average clinic, providers have a significant financial incentive to improve these figures.\nTransportation problems are only one small part of the reason why patients might skip out on their scheduled visits, but ensuring access to a lift is one of the easier issues to address.\nMedicaid provides non-emergency transportation services to beneficiaries who do not have access to – or cannot utilize -cars, trains, or buses to get to their medical appointments. Beneficiaries who do not hold a driver’s license, don’t have a working vehicle in the household, or have a disability or condition that precludes independent travel are eligible for covered transportation services.\nThe advent of ridesharing services has also revolutionized the routine healthcare transport environment. In 2016, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association estimated that ridesharing apps like Lyft and Uber could significant reduce the $2.7 billion federal spend on non-emergency transportation.\nIndustry partnerships have proliferated rapidly, allowing patients to access services through their smartphones at lower costs to the healthcare system. As these companies continue to expand into more cities and rural areas, patients may be less likely to miss their scheduled visits.\nThe CDC also provides a transportation health impact assessment toolkit for providers who wish to understand their community’s challenges and implement strategies to reduce burdens and improve mobility.\nACCESS TO HEALTHY, NUTRITIOUS FOOD CHOICES\nDietary choices are directly linked to the development of costly chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. Access to healthy, safe, and produce-rich food choices can reduce malnutrition and its associated risk of infectious disease as well as the economic burdens of obesity, which were estimated at $147 billion in 2008.\nIn 2012,the costs of diabetes totaled $245 billion, including $176 billion in direct healthcare costs and around $69 billion in productivity losses.\nJust over half of US residents adhered to recommended dietary guidelines in 2010, while only 20 percent of adults received the recommended amount of daily physical activity each day.\nAbout three-quarters of the population fails to incorporate enough fruits and vegetables in their daily diets, and most exceed the recommended levels of fats, sugars, simple carbohydrates, and sodium.\nEducating patients about their dietary habits is an important component of improving eating habits, but so is ensuring that individuals can access affordable healthy foods easily within their communities.\nNearly 30 million people live in areas where the closes grocery store offering produce and other fresh options is more than a mile away. In rural areas, the closest supermarket is often 20 miles away or more. For residents with limited transportation options, this is often too far – especially when convenience stores and fast-food outlets offer closer, cheaper options for a quick meal.\nThe Healthy Food Access Portal , supported by a collaborative partnership including the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation and Center for Healthy Food Access, can help providers engage in federal and local-level policy initiatives geared at expanding access to quality food choices in low-income and underserved communities.\nPUBLIC SAFETY AND INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE\nCommunities with high levels of crime and violence are also among the most likely to experience widespread economic and social instability. High rates of incarceration, the threat of domestic abuse, child abuse, and interpersonal violence, and prevalent street crime can lead to significant difficulties with maintaining healthy behaviors and accessing care.\nHomicide takes more than 16,000 lives each year, and is the leading cause of death for people aged 15 to 24. In 2011, six percent of high school–aged youths said they skipped at least one day of school in a 30-day period due to feeling too unsafe to attend.\nSource: FBI/ FactCheck.org\nViolence can also easily spill over into the healthcare setting, putting clinicians and other staff members at risk. Healthcare organizations spend around $2.7 billion each year on proactive and reactive violence response efforts, the American Hospital Association said in a 2017 report.\nThe figure includes $280 million for preparedness and prevention, $852 million in uncompensated care for victims of violence, more than $1 billion on training to prevent violence in hospitals, and $429 million coping with care, indemnity, and other costs resulting from violence against hospital employees.\nThe American Society for Healthcare Risk Management provides a healthcare facility workplace violence assessment toolkit that can help organizations reduce their incidence of violence against staff.\nAddressing violence in the community and between individuals requires a concerted, policy-based approach to elimination opportunities for violence , reducing income inequality that leads to violent tensions, and ensuring that victims of abuse and violence have the resources, support, and skills they need to leave dangerous situations.\nSOCIAL SUPPORT AND CAREGIVER AVAILABILITY\nLoneliness is one of the biggest and most underreported public health threats.While seniors are prone to feeling isolated as their social connections change with age, children and teenagers are also extremely likely to feel as if they are unable to share their emotions and thoughts with friends or family.\nThe stress of social isolation can lead to premature cognitive decline and dementia, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, exasperation of depression and anxiety, and premature death.\nStrong social support networks for children and adolescents contribute to building mental and emotional resiliency that may help to reduce the likelihood of engaging in risk behaviors, succumbing to peer pressure, or developing anxiety-driven behavioral health concerns.\nFor seniors, caregivers are often involved in making critical health decisions and helping elderly patients cope with hospitalizations and declining independence. About half of elderly patients require significant help with decision-making when hospitalized, said a 2014 study from JAMA.\nNearly 60 percent of the decisions made by caregivers in these situations involved life-sustaining care, while half involved discharge planning and post-acute care.\nWhile the availability of caregivers is crucial for many patients, healthcare providers must also provide support for family members and friends charged with the difficult task of overseeing the needs of their loved ones.\nStress, anxiety, and depression among caregivers are extraordinarily prevalent, with some estimates showing that between 40 and 70 percent of caregivers experience clinically significant mental health concerns. As patients decline in health, the mental health impacts on their caregivers increase dramatically as feelings of frustration, helplessness, loneliness, grief, and guilt can rise.\nEnsuring that both patients and their caregivers have the emotional and social support required to make the best possible decisions for themselves and their loved ones can help to reduce the negative impacts of many social determinants of health.\nRobust social support networks and community initiatives can prevent malnutrition and improve social interactions among seniors, lower the risk of adolescents engaging in interpersonal violence or leaving school, reduce the risk of chronic disease development due to stress, and make it easier for caregivers to maintain stable employment as well as their own friendships and relationships while they make informed decisions about care.\nSuccessful population health management programs that hope to address the myriad social determinants of health-including the many factors not directly outlined here-will be rooted in providing compassionate, holistic, and personalized support to individuals facing any number of socioeconomic challenges and obstacles in their daily lives.\nImage Credit: medgadget', ""How It All Started\nThis initiative was developed in response to an all too familiar story that was shared\nabout a patient who arrived frequently in need of hospital stays. After admission\nand treatment her condition would improve, but she would be discharged only to return\nfor readmittance in a week or two. A deeper conversation followed by a home visit\nrevealed that the patient could not read and did not understand how to take her medication\nappropriately. The story demonstrates the importance of patient-provider communication\nand patient health literacy on health outcomes. You can read the full story here.\nWhat Is Health Literacy\nHealth literacy is “the degree to which individuals can obtain, process and understand the basic health information and services they need to make appropriate health decisions.”1,2 Unfortunately, millions of adult Americans lack adequate health literacy skills. According to the National Assessment of Adult Literacy, only 12% of adults have proficient health literacy skills in the United States.3 This means 9 out of 10 adults may not possess adequate and appropriate skills needed to address their health.\nThis is especially concerning as health literacy is considered to be a stronger predictor of an individual’s health status than other socioeconomic factors such as age, education, employment, and income.2,4\nIn fact, limited health literacy is directly linked to increased rates of hospitalization, increased health care costs, and poor health, as well as feelings of shame and stigma from not being able to read, understand, and communicate about one’s health.5,6,7 Patients with poor health literacy use healthcare services frequently leading to increased healthcare costs.8 Individuals with limited health literacy may also have less knowledge about their condition resulting in difficulty managing treatment and care plans.9\nOftentimes, medical information is communicated in technical language which can negatively impact patient-provider communication.10 Improving patient health literacy and patient-provider communication is key in decreasing repeat medical visits, enhancing patient experiences and health outcomes, and decreasing healthcare provider burden.11,12\nThis video by the American Medical Association demonstrates the importance of clear communication\nbetween patients and providers.\nWhat We Are Doing\nArnold School of Public Health investigators in collaboration with community and clinical partners have been funded by The Duke Endowment grant #6816-SP to:\n- Understand clinic readiness for implementing a health literacy initiative\n- Implement an evidence-informed health literacy intervention\n- Increase provider awareness about health literacy and improve communication practices\n- Improve patient participation in health care encounters and health literacy. The health literacy initiative will be implemented in two phases\nPhase 1 will determine patient communication needs and readiness of health care facilities to implement an evidence-informed health literacy initiative through an electronic survey of clinics across South Carolina.\nPhase 2 will involve implementation of this initiative to improve health literacy, patient-provider communication, and health outcomes. The program uses three basic questions (“What is my main problem?,” “What do I need to do about it?,” “Why is it important for me to do this?”) to help patients better understand their diagnosis and treatment plan. Twenty clinics will be selected to participate based on survey results, in-person interviews and site visits.\n- U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. (n.d.). Healthy People 2020.

89	legal break car window save pet florida	In Florida, it is legal for someone to break into a locked vehicle to rescue pets that are believed to be in imminent danger of suffocation or overheating. You must call 911 before or immediately after breaking in.	"[""Whether taking a trip to the veterinarian or just out for a ride, pet owners often transport their animals in cars. A pet owner who fails to take precautions ensuring his pet’s safety in a vehicle may endanger his pet’s life and face legal consequences. In an effort to protect both pet owners and their four-legged friends, Florida has laws designed to ensure the safety of animals when traveling in cars.\nUnrestrained Animals in Vehicles\nProperly secured animals are less likely to suffer injuries caused by a vehicle’s abrupt movements, or if they're involved in auto accidents. While Florida currently has no laws regarding restraining pets inside cars, one local jurisdiction specifically protects animals riding in pickup truck beds. Miami-Dade County law states that pets riding in the bed of a pickup truck must be confined inside a carrier that is secured to the vehicle, or be restrained with tethers attached to the animal’s harness in a safe and humane way. In Miami-Dade County, the penalty for violating the law on properly restraining an animal in a vehicle is a maximum $500 fine and up to 60 days in the county jail.\nUnattended Pets in a Vehicle\nWhen the temperature outside reaches 85 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature inside a car can climb to 120 degrees F in just 30 minutes, so leaving pets unattended in cars on warm days, even for a short time, can cause irreversible organ damage or even death, according to the Humane Society of the United States. In an effort to prevent these tragedies, Orange County, Florida, enacted a law specifically stating that a person may be charged with animal neglect for leaving a dog, cat or other animal unattended in a car without proper ventilation. Leaving your pet unattended is a civil infraction punishable by a fine of up to $500.\nRead More: Pets & Wills\nState Animal Cruelty Laws\nIn addition to various local rules, Florida has animal cruelty laws stating that a person may be charged with animal cruelty for transporting an animal in a vehicle in an inhumane manner. Furthermore, anyone who unnecessarily causes an animal’s death by depriving it of life-sustaining water and shelter may be charged under this law. Leaving an animal in a hot car or unsafely transporting it a vehicle could result in an animal cruelty charge under state law.\nPenalties and Fines\nPenalties for violating animal protection laws in Florida vary depending on the jurisdiction. Anyone convicted under the state law against animal cruelty faces a first-degree misdemeanor, possible jail time and a $5,000 fine. A person charged in Orange County of animal neglect could receive a maximum $500 fine and face criminal charges. In Florida, it is legal for someone to break into a locked vehicle to rescue pets that are believed to be in imminent danger of suffocation or overheating. You must call 911 before or immediately after breaking in.\nFlorida counties have their own rules about leaving pets unattended in cars, and about restraining animals riding in vehicles. It's legal to break into a car if you think that a pet is overheating. If you take your pet with you to the store or anywhere else and can't bring him inside, make sure the windows are down and he has water, and don't leave him there for more than a few minutes.\nJen Gehring is a political consultant and college law professor.

90	Need help with my painting app. What makes white?	In the RGB color space, white is represented by the tuple (255, 255, 255), which means maximum values for all three components: red, green, and blue.	"['It may be the era of deep learning and big data, where complex algorithms analyze images by being shown millions of them, but color spaces are still surprisingly useful for image analysis. Simple methods can still be powerful.\nIn this article, you will learn how to simply segment an object from an image based on color in Python using OpenCV. A popular computer vision library written in C/C++ with bindings for Python, OpenCV provides easy ways of manipulating color spaces.\nWhile you don’t need to be already familiar with OpenCV or the other helper packages used in this article, it is assumed that you have at least a basic understanding of coding in Python.\nFree Bonus: Click here to get the Python Face Detection & OpenCV Examples Mini-Guide that shows you practical code examples of real-world Python computer vision techniques.\nWhat Are Color Spaces?\nIn the most common color space, RGB (Red Green Blue), colors are represented in terms of their red, green, and blue components. In more technical terms, RGB describes a color as a tuple of three components. Each component can take a value between 0 and 255, where the tuple\n(0, 0, 0) represents black and\n(255, 255, 255) represents white.\nRGB is considered an “additive” color space, and colors can be imagined as being produced from shining quantities of red, blue, and green light onto a black background.\nHere are a few more examples of colors in RGB:\n|Red||255, 0, 0|\n|Orange||255, 128, 0|\n|Pink||255, 153, 255|\nRGB is one of the five major color space models, each of which has many offshoots. There are so many color spaces because different color spaces are useful for different purposes.\nIn the printing world, CMYK is useful because it describes the color combinations required to produce a color from a white background. While the 0 tuple in RGB is black, in CMYK the 0 tuple is white. Our printers contain ink canisters of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.\nIn certain types of medical fields, glass slides mounted with stained tissue samples are scanned and saved as images. They can be analyzed in HED space, a representation of the saturations of the stain types—hematoxylin, eosin, and DAB—applied to the original tissue.\nHSV and HSL are descriptions of hue, saturation, and brightness/luminance, which are particularly useful for identifying contrast in images. These color spaces are frequently used in color selection tools in software and for web design.\nIn reality, color is a continuous phenomenon, meaning that there are an infinite number of colors. Color spaces, however, represent color through discrete structures (a fixed number of whole number integer values), which is acceptable since the human eye and perception are also limited. Color spaces are fully able to represent all the colors we are able to distinguish between.\nNow that we understand the concept of color spaces, we can go on to use them in OpenCV.\nSimple Segmentation Using Color Spaces\nTo demonstrate the color space segmentation technique, we’ve provided a small dataset of images of clownfish in the Real Python materials repository here for you to download and play with. Clownfish are easily identifiable by their bright orange color, so they’re a good candidate for segmentation. Let’s see how well we can find Nemo in an image.\nThe key Python packages you’ll need to follow along are NumPy, the foremost package for scientific computing in Python, Matplotlib, a plotting library, and of course OpenCV. This articles uses OpenCV 3.2.0, NumPy 1.12.1, and Matplotlib 2.0.2. Slightly different versions won’t make a significant difference in terms of following along and grasping the concepts.\nColor Spaces and Reading Images in OpenCV\nFirst, you will need to set up your environment. This article will assume you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Note that while the current version of OpenCV is 3.x, the name of the package to import is still\n>>> import cv2\nIf you haven’t previously installed OpenCV on your computer, the import will fail until you do that first. You can find a user-friendly tutorial for installing on different operating systems here, as well as OpenCV’s own installation guide. Once you’ve successfully imported OpenCV, you can look at all the color space conversions OpenCV provides, and you can save them all into a variable:\n>>> flags = [i for i in dir(cv2) if i.startswith(\'COLOR_\')]\nThe list and number of flags may vary slightly depending on your version of OpenCV, but regardless, there will be a lot! See how many flags you have available:\n>>> len(flags) 258 >>> flags \'COLOR_BGR2RGB\'\nThe first characters after\nCOLOR_ indicate the origin color space, and the characters after the\n2 are the target color space. This flag represents a conversion from BGR (Blue, Green, Red) to RGB. As you can see, the two color spaces are very similar, with only the first and last channels swapped.\nYou will need\nmatplotlib.pyplot for viewing the images, and NumPy for some image manipulation. If you do not already have Matplotlib or NumPy installed, you will need to\npip3 install matplotlib and\npip3 install numpy before attempting the imports:\n>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt >>> import numpy as np\nNow you are ready to load and examine an image. Note that if you are working from the command line or terminal, your images will appear in a pop-up window. If you are working in a Jupyter notebook or something similar, they will simply be displayed below. Regardless of your setup, you should see the image generated by the\n>>> nemo = cv2.imread(\'./images/nemo0.jpg\') >>> plt.imshow(nemo) >>> plt.show()\nHey, Nemo…or Dory? You’ll notice that it looks like the blue and red channels have been mixed up. In fact, OpenCV by default reads images in BGR format. You can use the\ncvtColor(image, flag) and the flag we looked at above to fix this:\n>>> nemo = cv2.cvtColor(nemo, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) >>> plt.imshow(nemo) >>> plt.show()\nNow Nemo looks much more like himself.\nVisualizing Nemo in RGB Color Space\nHSV is a good choice of color space for segmenting by color, but to see why, let’s compare the image in both RGB and HSV color spaces by visualizing the color distribution of its pixels. A 3D plot shows this quite nicely, with each axis representing one of the channels in the color space. If you want to know how to make a 3D plot, view the collapsed section:\nTo make the plot, you will need a few more Matplotlib libraries:\n>>> from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D >>> from matplotlib import cm >>> from matplotlib import colors\nThose libraries provide the functionalities you need for the plot. You want to place each pixel in its location based on its components and color it by its color. OpenCV\nsplit() is very handy here; it splits an image into its component channels. These few lines of code split the image and set up the 3D plot:\n>>> r, g, b = cv2.split(nemo) >>> fig = plt.figure() >>> axis = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1, projection=""3d"")\nNow that you have set up the plot, you need to set up the pixel colors. In order to color each pixel according to its true color, there’s a bit of reshaping and normalization required. It looks messy, but essentially you need the colors corresponding to every pixel in the image to be flattened into a list and normalized, so that they can be passed to the\nfacecolors parameter of Matplotlib\nNormalizing just means condensing the range of colors from\n0-1 as required for the\nfacecolors parameter. Lastly,\nfacecolors wants a list, not an NumPy array:\n>>> pixel_colors = nemo.reshape((np.shape(nemo)*np.shape(nemo), 3)) >>> norm = colors.Normalize(vmin=-1.,vmax=1.) >>> norm.autoscale(pixel_colors) >>> pixel_colors = norm(pixel_colors).tolist()\nNow we have all the components ready for plotting: the pixel positions for each axis and their corresponding colors, in the format\nfacecolors expects. You can build the scatter plot and view it:\n>>> axis.scatter(r.flatten(), g.flatten(), b.flatten(), facecolors=colours, marker=""."") >>> axis.set_xlabel(""Red"") >>> axis.set_ylabel(""Green"") >>> axis.set_zlabel(""Blue"") >>> plt.show()\nHere is the colored scatter plot for the Nemo image in RGB:\nFrom this plot, you can see that the orange parts of the image span across almost the entire range of red, green, and blue values. Since parts of Nemo stretch over the whole plot, segmenting Nemo out in RGB space based on ranges of RGB values would not be easy.\nVisualizing Nemo in HSV Color Space\nWe saw Nemo in RGB space, so now let’s view him in HSV space and compare.\nAs mentioned briefly above, HSV stands for Hue, Saturation, and Value (or brightness), and is a cylindrical color space. The colors, or hues, are modeled as an angular dimension rotating around a central, vertical axis, which represents the value channel. Values go from dark (0 at the bottom) to light at the top. The third axis, saturation, defines the shades of hue from least saturated, at the vertical axis, to most saturated furthest away from the center:\nTo convert an image from RGB to HSV, you can use\n>>> hsv_nemo = cv2.cvtColor(nemo, cv2.COLOR_RGB2HSV)\nhsv_nemo stores the representation of Nemo in HSV. Using the same technique as above, we can look at a plot of the image in HSV, generated by the collapsed section below:\nThe code to show the image in HSV is the same as for RGB. Note that you use the same\npixel_colors variable for coloring the pixels, since Matplotlib expects the values to be in RGB:\n>>> h, s, v = cv2.split(hsv_nemo) >>> fig = plt.figure() >>> axis = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1, projection=""3d"") >>> axis.scatter(h.flatten(), s.flatten(), v.flatten(), facecolors=pixel_colors, marker=""."") >>> axis.set_xlabel(""Hue"") >>> axis.set_ylabel(""Saturation"") >>> axis.set_zlabel(""Value"") >>> plt.show()\nIn HSV space, Nemo’s oranges are much more localized and visually separable. The saturation and value of the oranges do vary, but they are mostly located within a small range along the hue axis. This is the key point that can be leveraged for segmentation.\nPicking Out a Range\nLet’s threshold Nemo just based on a simple range of oranges. You can choose the range by eyeballing the plot above or using a color picking app online such as this RGB to HSV tool. The swatches chosen here are a light orange and a darker orange that is almost red:\n>>> light_orange = (1, 190, 200) >>> dark_orange = (18, 255, 255)\nIf you want to use Python to display the colors you chose, click on the collapsed section:\nA simple way to display the colors in Python is to make small square images of the desired color and plot them in Matplotlib. Matplotlib only interprets colors in RGB, but handy conversion functions are provided for the major color spaces so that we can plot images in other color spaces:\n>>> from matplotlib.colors import hsv_to_rgb\nThen, build the small\n10x10x3 squares, filled with the respective color. You can use NumPy to easily fill the squares with the color:\n>>> lo_square = np.full((10, 10, 3), light_orange, dtype=np.uint8) / 255.0 >>> do_square = np.full((10, 10, 3), dark_orange, dtype=np.uint8) / 255.0\nFinally, you can plot them together by converting them to RGB for viewing:\n>>> plt.subplot(1, 2, 1) >>> plt.imshow(hsv_to_rgb(do_square)) >>> plt.subplot(1, 2, 2) >>> plt.imshow(hsv_to_rgb(lo_square)) >>> plt.show()\nThat produces these images, filled with the chosen colors:\nOnce you get a decent color range, you can use\ncv2.inRange() to try to threshold Nemo.\ninRange() takes three parameters: the image, the lower range, and the higher range. It returns a binary mask (an\nndarray of 1s and 0s) the size of the image where values of\n1 indicate values within the range, and zero values indicate values outside:\n>>> mask = cv2.inRange(hsv_nemo, light_orange, dark_orange)\nTo impose the mask on top of the original image, you can use\ncv2.bitwise_and(), which keeps every pixel in the given image if the corresponding value in the mask is\n>>> result = cv2.bitwise_and(nemo, nemo, mask=mask)\nTo see what that did exactly, let’s view both the mask and the original image with the mask on top:\n>>> plt.subplot(1, 2, 1) >>> plt.imshow(mask, cmap=""gray"") >>> plt.subplot(1, 2, 2) >>> plt.imshow(result) >>> plt.show()\nThere you have it! This has already done a decent job of capturing the orange parts of the fish. The only problem is that Nemo also has white stripes… Fortunately, adding a second mask that looks for whites is very similar to what you did already with the oranges:\n>>> light_white = (0, 0, 200) >>> dark_white = (145, 60, 255)\nOnce you’ve specified a color range, you can look at the colors you’ve chosen:\nTo display the whites, you can take the same approach as we did previously with the oranges:\n>>> lw_square = np.full((10, 10, 3), light_white, dtype=np.uint8) / 255.0 >>> dw_square = np.full((10, 10, 3), dark_white, dtype=np.uint8) / 255.0 >>> plt.subplot(1, 2, 1) >>> plt.imshow(hsv_to_rgb(lw_square)) >>> plt.subplot(1, 2, 2) >>> plt.imshow(hsv_to_rgb(dw_square)) >>> plt.show()\nThe upper range I’ve chosen here is a very blue white, because the white does have tinges of blue in the shadows. Let’s create a second mask and see if it captures Nemo’s stripes. You can build a second mask the same way as you did the first:\n>>> mask_white = cv2.inRange(hsv_nemo, light_white, dark_white) >>> result_white = cv2.bitwise_and(nemo, nemo, mask=mask_white) >>> plt.subplot(1, 2, 1) >>> plt.imshow(mask_white, cmap=""gray"") >>> plt.subplot(1, 2, 2) >>> plt.imshow(result_white) >>> plt.show()\nNot bad! Now you can combine the masks. Adding the two masks together results in\n1 values wherever there is orange or white, which is exactly what is needed. Let’s add the masks together and plot the results:\n>>> final_mask = mask + mask_white >>> final_result = cv2.bitwise_and(nemo, nemo, mask=final_mask) >>> plt.subplot(1, 2, 1) >>> plt.imshow(final_mask, cmap=""gray"") >>> plt.subplot(1, 2, 2) >>> plt.imshow(final_result) >>> plt.show()\nEssentially, you have a rough segmentation of Nemo in HSV color space. You’ll notice there are a few stray pixels along the segmentation border, and if you like, you can use a Gaussian blur to tidy up the small false detections.\nA Gaussian blur is an image filter that uses a kind of function called a Gaussian to transform each pixel in the image. It has the result of smoothing out image noise and reducing detail. Here’s what applying the blur looks like for our image:\n>>> blur = cv2.GaussianBlur(final_result, (7, 7), 0) >>> plt.imshow(blur) >>> plt.show()\nDoes This Segmentation Generalize to Nemo’s Relatives?\nJust for fun, let’s see how well this segmentation technique generalizes to other clownfish images. In the repository, there’s a selection of six images of clownfish from Google, licensed for public use. The images are in a subdirectory and indexed nemoi.jpg, where i is the index from\nFirst, load all Nemo’s relatives into a list:\npath = ""./images/nemo"" nemos_friends =  for i in range(6): friend = cv2.cvtColor(cv2.imread(path + str(i) + "".jpg""), cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) nemos_friends.append(friend)\nYou can combine all the code used above to segment a single fish into a function that will take an image as input and return the segmented image. Expand this section to see what that looks like:\nHere is the\ndef segment_fish(image): \'\'\' Attempts to segment the clownfish out of the provided image \'\'\' # Convert the image into HSV hsv_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_RGB2HSV) # Set the orange range light_orange = (1, 190, 200) dark_orange = (18, 255, 255) # Apply the orange mask mask = cv2.inRange(hsv_image, light_orange, dark_orange) # Set a white range light_white = (0, 0, 200) dark_white = (145, 60, 255) # Apply the white mask mask_white = cv2.inRange(hsv_image, light_white, dark_white) # Combine the two masks final_mask = mask + mask_white result = cv2.bitwise_and(image, image, mask=final_mask) # Clean up the segmentation using a blur blur = cv2.GaussianBlur(result, (7, 7), 0) return blur\nWith that useful function, you can then segment all the fish:\nresults = [segment_fish(friend) for friend in nemos_friends]\nLet’s view all the results by plotting them in a loop:\nfor i in range(1, 6): plt.subplot(1, 2, 1) plt.imshow(nemos_friends[i]) plt.subplot(1, 2, 2) plt.imshow(results[i]) plt.show()\nThe foreground clownfish has orange shades darker than our range.\nThe shadowed bottom half of Nemo’s nephew is completely excluded, but bits of the purple anemone in the background look awfully like Nemo’s blue tinged stripes…\nOverall, this simple segmentation method has successfully located the majority of Nemo’s relatives. It is clear, however, that segmenting one clownfish with particular lighting and background may not necessarily generalize well to segmenting all clownfish.\nIn this tutorial, you’ve seen what a few different color spaces are, how an image is distributed across RGB and HSV color spaces, and how to use OpenCV to convert between color spaces and segment out ranges.\nAltogether, you’ve learned how a basic understanding of how color spaces in OpenCV can be used to perform object segmentation in images, and hopefully seen its potential for doing other tasks as well. Where lighting and background are controlled, such as in an experimental setting or with a more homogeneous dataset, this segmentation technique is simple, fast, and reliable.\n[ Improve Your Python With 🐍 Python Tricks 💌 – Get a short & sweet Python Trick delivered to your inbox every couple of days. >> Click here to learn more and see examples ]\nSource From: realpython.com.\nOriginal article title: Color Spaces and How to Use Them With OpenCV and Python.\nThis full article can be read at: Color Spaces and How to Use Them With OpenCV and Python.']"	['<urn:uuid:73b36ee7-5358-4eb5-906b-8ac8ddba1701>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	9	26	2864
91	I need to prepare some samples for nanoparticle analysis - what are the key things I should keep in mind to get good results when testing them?	There are several important considerations for sample preparation: 1) The buffer that suspends the samples should be filtered to eliminate background debris. 2) Avoid mixing samples vigorously right before reading as this creates interfering air bubbles. 3) Since small synthetic particles tend to clump together, you may need to sonicate samples before reading them, though they should be read quickly after sonication since aggregation will begin again. 4) If sonication isn't possible for biological samples, triturate the samples to distribute them evenly. 5) The sample concentration should be carefully determined, as higher concentrations can lead to aggregation or swarming issues.	['How Violet Side Scatter Enables Nanoparticle Detection\nGeorge C. Brittain, Ph.D., Sergei Gulnik, Ph.D., Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, Miami, FL 33196\nThe detection of sub-micron particles by flow cytometry becomes increasingly difficult as the particle sizes progress smaller than the wavelength of the light being used to detect them. In addition, the amount of light scattered by any particle is directly proportional to the diameter of the particle and inversely proportional to the wavelength of the light being used to detect it. This relationship can be seen in the equations for both Mie Theory and Raleigh Light Scattering, which are used for calculating theoretical light scattering by particles either similar in size or much smaller than the wavelength of the light being used to detect them, respectively (Bohren & Huffmann, 2010). For this reason, the smaller violet (405 nm) wavelength will result in more orthogonal light scattering at any given particle size than the blue (488 nm) wavelength, and will increase the range of resolution to smaller particles than can be detected by standard side scatter. Moreover, upon entering a medium of a different refractive index, light waves are refracted by the new medium inversely proportional to the wavelength of the light, with smaller wavelengths having a higher refraction than larger wavelengths. This effect was first discovered by Isaac Newton when he split white light into a rainbow of individual colors using a prism, with red light refracting the least and violet light refracting the most (Figure 1) (Newton, 1704).\nBased upon this physical property, the use of violet light will help to amplify the difference in the refractive indices between the particles and their surrounding media, and in turn increases the ability to detect particles with a lower refractive index, such as exosomes, microvesicles and silica nanoparticles. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how to setup the CytoFLEX flow cytometer to detect small particles by Violet Side Scatter (VSSC).\nFigure 1. A simplified depiction of the Newtonian light refraction through a cell based upon wavelength.\nSetting up the CytoFLEX to Detect Violet Side Scatter\nSetting up VSSC detection on the CytoFLEX is easy. In the CytExpert program, simply select the Cytometer tab within the Menu Bar, and then select Detector Configuration. Within the Detection Configuration pop-up window, replace the 450 nm filter with the 405 nm filter, and appropriately label the detector as VSSC. Once you save the detector configuration, you select that configuration to be the current setting, and physically move the 405 nm filter into the 450 nm slot within the instrument. At this point, you will need to start a new experiment within the CytExpert program for the new detector configuration to apply, and you are ready to go.\nOnce running, in order to properly separate nanoparticles from background noise using VSSC, you will need to open up the Acquisition Settings Menu, select VSSC as the primary trigger (Height is better than Area), and then manually adjust the trigger level until you reach the discrimination threshold between the noise and actual events. This trigger level is usually very consistent with the CytoFLEX at any given laser intensity and gain setting, both between experiments and on different days.\nSeveral considerations to keep in mind are that you will need to adjust the range of the VSSC histogram in order to hone in on the size range of interest since the default chart settings will have the smaller particles pushed up against the y-axis; once within that range, a logarithmic scale will provide for a better distribution of multi-modal particle sizes; and, if the scaling for the Counts axis is selected to “Fit to Sample”, it will always re-scale the data to fit to the entire histogram. The latter issue can create confusion particularly if you set the threshold trigger using buffer alone rather than determining it empirically using the smaller particles of interest. In this case, the histogram for the noise will continue to readjust to the maximum regardless of where you place the trigger, and without the particles as a reference, the chosen trigger setting may actually cut off or eliminate the particles of interest when you begin testing. It is best to set the trigger using the smallest detectable particles that you have available, which can clearly be discriminated from the background noise. Using these, you can hone in on the real sample population, and then back the trigger off until you are comfortable with the level of noise that remains (Figure 2). However, if the chosen threshold level is too low, you will have an increased abort rate due to the noise. Ultimately, you should try to keep the abort rate below 5-10 % either by adjusting the threshold, the sample concentration, or the flow rate. Keeping the sample concentration and flow rate low is also important to prevent experimental artifacts due to coincidence (i.e., swarming) (Nolan, 2015; Nolan & Stoner, 2013).\nFigure 2. An example of the separation between a real sample population and background noise while setting the VSSC trigger threshold. This sample is 100 nm polystyrene beads at a 1:100K dilution in 0.02 mm-filtered water.\nConsiderations for Sample Preparation\nThe analysis of micro- and nanoparticles requires some careful preparation of the samples to be analyzed. First, the buffer that the samples are suspended in should be filtered with an appropriate molecular-weight cutoff in order to eliminate any background debris that may fall within the range of your populations of interest. Second, as is commonly mentioned in protocols and data sheets, the samples should not be mixed in such a vigorous manner as to create air bubbles immediately prior to reading. These bubbles will interfere with data acquisition, as they\nalso refract light and will be detected as events. Third, a lot of small synthetic particles have the tendency to clump together, resulting in the formation of aggregates that may be either inaccurately sized or aborted altogether. In the case of either bubbles or aggregation, sonicating the samples prior to reading can help. After sonication, the samples should be read as quickly as possible because aggregation will begin anew and the sample population(s) will be affected over time (Figure 3). If sonication is not acceptable, such as with biological samples, then simply triturate the samples as well as possible in order to evenly distribute the sample prior to acquisition. Finally, the concentration of the sample should also be titrated in order to determine the optimal working range for acquisition by flow cytometry, as higher concentrations will lead to aggregation and/or swarming (Figure 4).\nFigure 3. The reduction in signal of a polystyrene nanoparticle population over time. These samples are 100 nm polystyrene beads at a 1:100K dilution in 0.02 mm-filtered water read at 0, 30, or 60 minutes after sonication.\nFigure 4. Finding the optimal concentration for the nanoparticle sample. These samples are 100 nm polystyrene beads in 0.02 µm-filtered water at a dilution of 1:1K, 1:10K or 1:100K from the 1 % stock solution. From these results 1:100K could clearly be seen to provide both the best signal and least aggregation or swarming of the dilutions tested.\nTesting the Performance of the CytoFLEX with Nanoparticle Detection by Violet Side Scatter\nThe objective of the following experiment was to demonstrate the ability of the CytoFLEX to detect nanoparticles smaller than 200 nm by the use of VSSC.\nInstrument and Reagents\n|3-Laser CytoFLEX||B53000||Beckman Coulter|\n|CytoFLEX Sheath Fluid||B51503||Beckman Coulter|\n|Whatman Anotop 25 0.02 μm Filteres||09-926-13||Thermo Scientific|\n|40 nm Polystene Beads NIST||09-980-015||Thermo Scientific|\n|100 nm Polystene Beads NIST||09-980-021||Thermo Scientific|\n|200 nm Polystene Beads NIST||09-980-024||Thermo Scientific|\n|Multimodal Particle Size Standards||MM-010||Thermo Scientific|\n|94 nm Silica Beads NIST||147020-10||Corpuscular, Inc.|\n|150 nm Silica Beads NIST||147030-10||Corpuscular, Inc|\n|200 nm Silica Beads NIST||147040-10||Corpuscular, Inc|\nWe first compared the sensitivity of nanoparticle detection by 405 nm VSSC to standard 488 nm SSC using Duke Multimodal Particle Size Standards with a mix of 80 nm, 200 nm and 500 nm polystyrene beads. As can be seen in Figure 5A, the VSSC could easily discriminate the smaller 80 nm and 200 nm particles, while SSC did not begin to discriminate the populations until between 200 nm and 500 nm. Determining the signal-to-noise ratios of the different populations detected by FSC, SSC, or VSSC, the VSSC can be seen to perform better than SSC at all measured particle sizes (Figure 5B). By histogram, you can more clearly see the population densities and that the CytoFLEX using VSSC was easily able to discriminate polystyrene nanoparticles down to 80 nm using the Duke Multimodal Particle Size Standards (Figure 6). Polystyrene particles as small as 40 nm were able to be clearly detected above background, but they were located right on the noise threshold (Figure 7). Since the polystyrene beads have a refraction index of 1.5915 (at 589 nm), we also tested silica nanoparticles with a refraction index of 1.4584 (at 589 nm), closer to the range for exosomes and microsomes, which have a mean refraction index of around 1.426 (Gardiner et al., 2014). As a result, we were able to easily discriminate 150 nm and 200 nm silica nanoparticles, while 94 nm silica nanoparticles were detectable but on the noise threshold (Figure 8).\nComparing the sensitivity of nanoparticle detection by 405 nm VSSC to 488 nm SSC. Duke Multimodal Particle Size Standards (80 nm, 200 nm and 500 nm) in 0.02 μm-filtered water at a 1:10K dilution were analyzed using the CytoFLEX. Dot plot showing VSSC vs. SSC (A).

Comparison of 405 nm and 488 nm scatter detection of 40 nm polystyrene nanoparticles. These samples are 40 nm or 100 nm polystyrene beads in 0.02 μm-filtered water at a dilution of 1:10K or 1:100K, respectively (1 % stock) detected by 405 nm VSSC (A) or 488 nm SSC (B).\nComparison of 405 nm and 488 nm scatter detection of silica nanoparticles. These samples are 94 nm, 150 nm or 200 nm silica or 100 nm polystyrene nanoparticles in 0.02 μm filtered PBS. The silica nanoparticles were diluted 1:10K, while the polystyrene nanoparticles were diluted 1:100K, from the 1 % stock solution detected by 405 nm VSSC (A) or 488 nm SSC (B).\nUsing VSSC, the CytoFLEX was able to clearly discriminate 80nm polystyrene and 150 nm silica nanoparticles from background noise. Moreover, the detection and discrimination of nanoparticles by VSSC was better than SSC for all particle sizes tested. Based upon these findings, we can confidently say that the CytoFLEX can be used for the detection of extracellular vesicles at least as small as 150 nm by VSSC. It may be possible to use VSSC to detect even smaller vesicles, as previous research has suggested that the refraction index of extracellular vesicles is inversely proportional to the size of the vesicles, with smaller 50 nm vesicles having a refraction index closer to 1.6 (similar to polystyrene) (Gardiner et al., 2014); however, this will need to be determined empirically.\n1.

92	affordable materials build fireplace mantel common options	Wood mantels are the most affordable option among fireplace mantel shelves. Brick mantels are also very affordable. Even expensive solid wood shelves like those made of oak don't cost as much as stone mantels.	['What Are The Different Types of Fireplace Mantel Shelves?\nFireplaces, heat providers aside, are great to look at. They live up to their status as the focal point of your room, if not your entire house. How you accessorize your fireplace, however largely affects the overall look of your interior decorations. This is the reason carefulness is needed when you decide to spruce up your hearth like for instance, adding a fireplace mantel.\nWhen deciding on a mantel shelf, there are many elements to take into account, starting off with the material. Here are four common materials used and how each of them fair, both functionality and decorative wise.\nAmong the fireplace mantel shelves, wood types are the most common. They work well in traditional looking homes and blend really nicely with almost any interior designs. Wood mantels offer many options when it comes to decorating. Oak, a superior type of wood, for instance is both classy and versatile.\nTypically wooden mantels are affordable. Its cost is one of its main attractions. Even expensive solid wood shelves like those made of oak don’t cost as much as those made of stone. Wooden mantels come in different wood types which include maple, cherry, Douglas, hemlock, alder, pine, just to name a few. They come in different finishes like black, distressed cherry, and primed. There are also unfinished wood fireplace mantels which are great for people who have yet to decide the best shade for their mantel to match their home interiors.\nHowever, one major drawback for wooden mantels is that it’s highly flammable. If you’re thinking of a wooden mantel shelf, make sure that you consult with your local building officer and fire safety code department for the safety regulations specifically on the desired measurements allowed from a wooden material to your fireplace.\nStone mantel shelves whether made of limestone, marble or granite are great for aesthetic functions. Home builders prefer stones simply because they give many options as they come in a variety of colors and textures. They are both beautiful and functional. Moreover, they can also be treated in several different ways providing more diverse choices that will surely match any discerning taste. It is likewise fireproof and durable, making it the best material for a mantel shelf. It is also relatively low on maintenance. It usually just takes a soft cloth to wipe it clean.\nOn the other hand, stone mantel shelves are generally more expensive than other options. It can also be difficult to install which makes installation cost higher than normal. For those who prefer stones but can’t afford it, there are actually cheaper alternatives which will give you the same stone façade. There are kits that you can buy in many home improvement stores or even through online shops. They look like the natural stone mantels but are much easier and cheaper to install.\nMetal is best known for being versatile. It goes well with almost any kind of designs most especially the modern or contemporary look. You don’t have to worry if your metal mantel shelves will clash with the rest of your interiors because chances are, there is always something in your room thats made of metal. Appliances alone are generally made of metal.\nMetal mantel shelves made from stainless steel, solid bronze, brass or aluminum among others. They are known to keep up their pristine look despite many wear and tear situations. With their bold lines and intricate craftsmanship, they are ideal for electric-powered fireplace. Also, because of their flexible features, metals can offer non-conventional shapes and forms, providing more unique designs than other available options.\nPerhaps next to wood, bricks are the most obvious choice for a mantel shelf. They are simple, functional and very affordable. If you are into Romanesque and country feel, bricks are definitely great options.\nDespite their simplicity and functionality, bricks, also have some drawbacks. They’re limited when it comes to color and texture options making it difficult to find one that matches the design you have in mind. To solve this limitation, tiles are often the ideal substitute for bricks.\nMeasurement and Prices:\nWhen selecting a mantel piece, material and dimensions are crucial factors to consider, along with price. In terms of measurements, most chimney pieces come in standard sizes. The average width ranges from 60-72 inches while height averages from 4.5-16.75 inches. They are also made available in custom sizes. Prices on the other hand can start from around $100 to as much as or over $500.\nBefore purchasing a mantel piece, it is always a good idea to shop around to compare prices as well as designs. Get accurate measurements and see safety measures. Installation of conventional mantel shelves is generally made easier by adjustable brackets. However, for more complex types, you might consider hiring a contractor. With the right fireplace mantel, you will surely have a more enjoyable fireplace experience.']	['<urn:uuid:c1883c75-3d4d-48de-ac37-76764d850114>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	7	34	817
93	As someone trying to understand both the physical and mental impacts of COVID-19, how does the virus affect people with chronic conditions, and what psychological challenges do people face during lockdowns?	People with chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease face increased risk of serious complications if they contract COVID-19, though these conditions don't make them more likely to catch the virus. Regarding psychological impacts, research has shown that lockdown measures lead to significant mental health challenges including confusion, fear, anger, anxiety and sleep difficulties. These psychological effects can persist, with some people showing longer-lasting behavioral changes like vigilant hand washing and crowd avoidance. The impact tends to be worse with longer isolation periods, with people experiencing loneliness, boredom, and frustration. Key stressors include fears about becoming infected, concerns about inadequate supplies, and insufficient information.	"['Written by Carole Jakucs, MSN, RN, PHN\nIf you’re living with diabetes, you likely have questions and concerns\nregarding COVID-19 (also known as coronavirus disease and the novel coronavirus).\nWhile having diabetes does not increase your risk for contracting coronavirus,\nif you do get the virus, you’re more\nsusceptible to developing serious complications and having poor outcomes.\nAn increased risk is also seen in patients who are living with other chronic\nmedical conditions such as, hypertension, heart and lung disease.\nWe want to provide you with the latest information on:\n- Ways to reduce your risk for contracting COVID-19\n- What to do if you get COVID-19\nIf you have any type of diabetes (Type 1, Type 2 or Gestational) you’ll\nwant to be sure to follow the CDC guidelines recommended for everyone,\nto protect yourself and\nreduce your risk of catching COVID-19.\nWays to reduce your risk\nThese strategies include:\nHand washing and hand sanitizer use: Wash your hands frequently with soap and clean, running water for at least\n20 seconds. Singing the song, ""Happy Birthday"" twice, which\nis about 20 seconds.\nBe sure to rub all surfaces of both your hands under clear, running water.\nDon\'t forget to wash your fingertips, thumbs, palms, between your\nfingers and tops of your hands.\nIf you\'re not by a sink with soap and running water, the next best\nway to clean your hands is by using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.\nBe sure to follow the directions on the bottle. Use the recommended amount\nof hand sanitizer, and rub all surfaces of your hands until the hand sanitizer dries.\nDon’t touch your eyes, nose and mouth with unclean hands: Always wash your hands before touching your face, before eating, after using the bathroom and when you return home.\nSocial distancing - Keep at least 6 feet of distance between yourself and others: Know that even people without symptoms are able to spread COVID-19.\nAvoid close contact with people who are sick: You’re at a higher risk of developing serious illness if contract COVID-19.\nFollow the stay-at-home recommendations: Heed this advice as much as possible as per the national, state and local\nguidelines provided by health and elected officials.\nDisinfect high-use surfaces: This includes surfaces in your home and those you may need to touch if\nyou have to go to the market, pharmacy or doctor’s office. Make\nsure to use products that have the word, “disinfectant” on\nthe label. The label should also list an Environmental Protection Agency\n- Shopping cart handles\n- Payment key pad surfaces at grocery or pharmacy check-outs\n- Counter tops\n- Door knobs\n- Light switches\n- Faucet handles\n- Cell phones\n- Steering wheel (car)\nIf you have to go out, wear a mask: While\nhome-made masks are not as effective as medical grade masks, they can offer some protection.\nWearing a mask does not replace social distancing (you still need to do that).\nIf you become ill with COVID-19\nRemember to continue your medication and treatment plan as prescribed by\n- Monitor your blood glucose (blood sugar) more often, to catch any highs\nor lows that can come from being ill. Infections, eating and drinking\nless, and taking new medicines can drastically affect blood glucose levels.\n- Monitor your ketones more often: High ketones can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis\n(DKA). DKA is a life-threatening condition if it’s not treated quickly.\nCall your doctor right way, and seek emergency care immediately.\n- Call your doctor for advice if your condition worsens, if you’re\nvomiting, have a high fever, develop moderate or large ketones or just\nfeel you are getting worse.\n- Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.\nRemember the 15:15 rule to treat hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) that is\n70 mg/dl or below, or below your target range. Eat 15 grams of easy-to-digest\n(simple) carbohydrate such as:\n- Orange juice\nSoda (regular with sugar –\n- Jam or jelly\n- Glucose tablets or liquid preparations (from a pharmacy)\nPlan ahead regarding refilling your medications:\n- Consider pharmacies that deliver so you don’t have to go out\n- Refill your medications before your supply is too low\n- Call your insurer to see if you qualify for 90-day refills (instead of 30-day)\nIf you use a continuous glucose monitor (CGM): Please be aware that your blood glucose readings can be affected by using\nTylenol (Acetaminophen). Double check your blood glucose results with\na fingerstick monitor.\nRemember that stress makes blood glucose rise: Find ways to de-stress with relaxation breathing, positive thoughts, mediation,\nprayer, imagery, reaching out to family and friends electronically, and\nseeking professional help from medical and mental health professionals\nas needed.

How can we better manage the anxiety that lockdown can provoke? Professor Cherie Armour from the Stress, Trauma, and Related Conditions (STARC) lab at Queen’s is working to find out.\nAs isolation, lockdown and quarantine measures are enforced throughout the UK and Ireland, a team of researchers from the Stress, Trauma, and Related Conditions (STARC) lab at Queen’s University School of Psychology are conducting a study which aims to better understand the impact that COVID19 is having on the psychological wellbeing of the people in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nProfessor Cherie Armour, who is leading the project says: “COVID-19 and the restrictions it places on the population as a whole, such as the need to self-isolate, is and will continue to be a stressful life event for many people across the country.\n“In Northern Ireland, Universities have moved their academic activities off campuses to online environments, schools and childcare settings have seen closures, as have pubs, restaurants, leisure venues, and shops selling non-essential goods. Businesses across many sectors are supporting their employees to work from home. With government rules stating you must stay at home, the daily escalation of the seriousness of the situation will of course be anxiety-provoking for many people.”\nProfessor Cherie Armour\nCOVID-19 and mental health\nProfessor Armour’s research focusses on adverse and/or traumatic life events, including those that occur because of someone’s occupational role (e.g. Police, Military & Ambulance services), and how those impact on psychological well-being. She is particularly interested in the psychological disorders of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Depression, Anxiety and Dissociation.\n“My focus is on biopsychosocial factors that exist pre-during- and post-trauma and how they predict someone’s risk of developing, or resilience against developing, mental ill health outcomes,” she explains.\nAs part of her research, Professor Armour examines the role of a number of things that might impact on the trauma exposure and mental health outcome relationship such as sleep, social support and emotion regulation.\nShe is now applying her research skills to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the overall psychological wellbeing of the population and what people can do to ensure that this impact is minimised for themselves and their families?\nThe impact of quarantine\nThe project follows research from Kings College London relating to the psychological impact of quarantine.\n“The research found that those quarantined reported heighted psychological distress including confusion, fear, anger, anxiety and difficulties with sleeping,” says Professor Armour. “One study reported that some longer lasting behavioural changes were seen such as vigilant hand washing and the avoidance of large crowds.”\nShe adds: “The research tells us that some of the key stressors during self-isolation / quarantine relate to fears about becoming infected, having inadequate supplies and inadequate information, a sense of loneliness through isolation, and feelings of boredom and frustration. Research has also found that longer durations of self-isolation / quarantine have a more adverse impact on psychological wellbeing.”\nWhile the Kings College project reviewed a relatively small number of studies (26 in total), it provided the research community with a good evidence base for further research. Professor Armour says it is therefore now vital that the research community mobilise to collect robust and reliable data that will allow us to understand what the psychological impact of COVID-19 is but also how that impact may change over time.\nGathering vital data\nTo that end, researchers at STARC have designed a longitudinal psychological wellbeing survey that is administered online.\n“This survey will ask people a wide variety of questions about their life experiences, physical health, living environments, exposures and worries related to COVID-19, sleeping habits, what social support networks they have, whether they are experiencing loneliness, how they are regulating their emotions, whether they can see meaning and purpose to their life, and whether they are experiencing any symptoms of depression, anxiety, or PTSD in response to the COVID19 situation,” says Professor Armour.\nThe first survey takes just 20 minutes to complete and then subsequent surveys will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.\nThe survey will allow researchers to examine the psychological wellbeing of subgroups, such as healthcare professionals and other key workers.\nProfessor Armour says “Previous research tells us that when people experience adverse life events those with better health, fewer past trauma experiences, more social support, a feeling of connectedness (i.e., not feeling lonely), those who have a sense of purpose and meaning in their life and those who can regulate their own emotions tend to experience fewer adverse impacts on their psychological wellbeing.\n“The survey will allow us to understand if this is indeed the case for COVID-19 and for all those currently self-isolating from within our Queen’s University community and from across the wider community of Northern Ireland. Ultimately, this will inform us in how to best offer pragmatic help, with a view to alleviating some of the pressure that services face during these unprecedented times.”']"	['<urn:uuid:71e42edc-18e8-4866-ab03-fa2bcb280819>', '<urn:uuid:ef55af05-b093-467b-b6c2-64ebce94f5fa>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	31	105	1651
94	Do both Sydney Airport and Neil Armstrong Airport have altitude restrictions?	Yes, both airports have altitude specifications. At Sydney Airport, aircraft typically fly at 5,000-7,000 feet when passing over suburbs like Sylvania and Miranda from the north, and 6,000-8,000 feet when arriving from the south-west. At Neil Armstrong Airport, the pattern altitude is specifically set at 1,902.5 feet MSL (Mean Sea Level).	"['Sydney Airport flight paths over the Sutherland Shire\nWhen the parallel runways are being used in a northerly direction, (“north flow”), arriving aircraft will pass over suburbs in the Sutherland Shire and nearby areas as they make their way to join the final approach from over water, south of Sydney. In north flow, aircraft that are approaching Sydney from the north, west, east and south-west must be directed by air traffic controllers into an orderly landing sequence. The image below of actual aircraft tracks illustrates this complex arrival procedure.\nArrivals from the north\nAircraft that arrive into Sydney from northern ports need to travel southwards across the city to join the final approach that begins over water. Aircraft using this flight path will generally be at altitudes within the range of 5000 to 7000 feet when they pass over suburbs such as Sylvania, Miranda and Gymea.\nThe image below is zoomed in and filtered to show only these arrivals travelling from the north to the south.\nArrivals from the south-west and west\nAircraft arriving into Sydney from the south-west will pass over suburbs such as Barden Ridge and Yarrawarrah before turning southwards and flying over the Royal National Park to cross the coast, as shown in the image below. Aircraft coming from the west will turn southwards over suburbs such as Illawong, Bangor, Jannali and Loftus as they too head towards the coast. All these aircraft will be generally within the altitude range of 6000 to 8000 feet.\nThe final approach paths are adjacent to Kurnell and Greenhills Beach. When they intercept the final approach aircraft will be at altitudes of around 3000 feet and will continue to descend steadily to the runway. Aircraft landing on the easternmost runway will be at an altitude of around 1000 feet when adjacent to Kurnell, while those landing on the westernmost runway will be around 1200 feet as they have slightly further to fly before touching down.\nWhen the parallel runways are being used in a southerly direction, (“south flow”), jet aircraft departures will be seen and heard by residents in suburbs such as Kurnell, Greenhills Beach and Cronulla. The image below shows the actual tracks of departing jets on this flight path.\nIn south flow, non-jet aircraft that take off from the westernmost parallel runway will turn right after departure over suburbs in the Sutherland Shire.\nNon-jets turn immediately after take-off in order to ensure they remain separated from the faster jet traffic which continues straight ahead.\nThe image below shows the actual tracks of non-jet aircraft using this flight path. Non-jets heading in a south-westerly direction are bound for destinations such as Canberra, Albury, Wollongong and the south coast. Others heading to destinations such as Bathurst, Orange and Dubbo and Mudgee turn west and north-west after their initial south-westerly turn.\nEast and west flow\nWhen the east-west runway is being used, some aircraft will fly over the Shire as they travel to join the final approach. These aircraft generally will be between 6000 and 8000 feet with most over 7000 feet. This flight path is shown in the image below.', 'About the Neil Armstrong Airport\nThe Auglaize County Neil Armstrong Airport is an authority operated general aviation facility with a rich aviation history.

95	manufacturing company lean quality goals explain what defines success	According to Toyota's principles, the goal of a Lean company is to achieve the highest quality at the lowest cost and the shortest lead time. This represents the definition of success in lean manufacturing, combining optimal product quality with cost efficiency and rapid production times.	['Lean Principles are treated in this video by the Japanese definition of Toyota and the development made by “Lean Thinking”.\nThe Conventional House Toyota\nThe first framework to explain the Lean principles is the conventional version of the Toyota house.\nThe Toyota house was developed by the large car manufacturer and in its original form, we can observe several elements.\nIn the base, there is the principle of stability that can be achieved through some tools such as the 5S, Visual Management, 7 Quality Tools, the standard Operation Procedures and clearly going and experiencing the Gemba.\nThe conventional Toyota house has two pillars indicating 2 other Lean principles.\nThe first is the Just in Time which means that each station must have what it needs when it is needed and in the quantity it is needed.\nThe second pillar is the Jidoka. Jidoka means autonomation, that is, automation with a human touch. The machine and man must stop as soon as they notice that they are producing a defect.\nThe roof of the Toyota house expresses the principle of Policy deployment also called hoshin kanri.\nI like to think that the roof is also like an arrow indicating the direction, the true north.\nI remind you that the goal of a Lean company is to seek the highest quality at the lowest cost and the shortest lead time.\nToyota House for Lean Enterprise\nOver time the Toyota house has evolved moving from mainly considering manufacturing to considering the whole company.\nIn this new version of the Toyota house, the principles have become the following:\nAt the base, we have the principles of challenge, Kaizen, teamwork, and Gemba.\nThe two pillars have become:\n1. Continuous Improvement.\n2. Respect for people.\nThe roof has the Toyota Way as an architrave and the Thinking People System above.\nIn fact, it can be said who the acronym TPS has turned from Toyota Production System into Thinking People System.\nLean Principles in Lean Thinking\nThe third and final framework that I want to present in this video on the Lean Principles, is the one described in detail in the book Lean Thinking by Womack and Jones.\nIn the book, the authors specify five Lean principles to be followed in order to transform a conventional company into a lean company.\n☑️ The first step is to specify the value from the customer’s perspective.\n☑️ The second step is to identify the value stream and map it. The most suitable tool to implement this principle is the value stream map.\n☑️ The third principle is the flow. You have to slide the value. If possible using the concepts of One Piece Flow or One Document Flow\n☑️ The fourth principle is Pull. Pull means a short term response to the change in customer demand without overproduction. I remind you that Taiichi Ohno defined overproduction as the father of the seven wastes.\n☑️ The fifth and final principle is perfection. If you have worked well in the implementation of the first four principles, realizing the latter will not seem impossible.\nPerfection does not mean only a product without defects but returning to what was previously described, you will have to create a high-quality product at the lowest cost at the shortest lead time.\nTo conclude, the frameworks presented to deal with the principles that must be followed by a lean company.\nIn the Japanese version of the Toyota house, there is no step-by-step ladder on how to implement these principles.\nI suggest you start from the base and then develop the two pillars and the roof.\nIn the American model of the 5 lean principles, the path to follow is much clearer and more linear and in the book Lean Thinking, which I recommend you read, they are explained in detail with many real application examples.\nRelevant Videos for Lean Principles']	['<urn:uuid:c75bb5f1-cc89-4421-8348-93c487760a8b>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	9	45	643
96	bank regulation anti money laundering requirements japan and letters of credit	In Japan, banks must perform extensive due diligence on clients, verify identities, and conduct background checks before opening accounts, with an obligation to report suspicious activities. For letters of credit, banks must conduct additional anti-money laundering checks, including reviewing deal structures, monitoring for suspicious discrepancies in document values, watching for unjustified amendments to letters of credit, and scrutinizing transfers to high-risk jurisdictions. Both systems emphasize customer due diligence and suspicious activity reporting as key requirements.	['Banking activity in Japan is strictly regulated and supervised. The main body tasked with the responsibility of regulating financial institutions in Japan is the Financial Services Agency (FSA). In Japan, banks must be incorporated in accordance with the requirements set out in the Companies Act, and must also be issued a banking license in keeping with the provisions of the Banking Act and Japanese Banking Law.\nFinancial Services Authority\nThe Banking Act provides the Commissioner of the FSA with the power to inspect accounts, reports and other information in relation to banks, related companies and their agencies. It provides the Commissioner with the power to enter the premises of banks to conduct physical inspections. The Banking Act also allows the FSA to impose penalties on parties for misconduct, and the FSA has the power to force a bank to cease operations or invalidate its banking license altogether.\nBank of Japan\nWhile the Bank of Japan has not been imbued with regulatory and punitive powers to the extent that the FSA has, it does play a significant role as a watchdog in the banking industry. The Bank of Japan is authorized to conduct inspections for the purposes of ensuring the health and stability of the monetary system where there exists an agreement between the Bank of Japan and banks or other financial institutions, such agreements existing mainly because of accounts the latter maintain with the Bank of Japan.\nPrevention of anti-competitive practices\nThe Antimonopoly Act is the main piece of legislation that has been enacted to combat anti-competitive practices. The act forbids banks and other financial institutions from obtaining shares in another Japanese company greater than 5%. There are, however, exceptions to the rule, and the Fair Trade Commission may permit banks or other financial institutions to acquire more than 5% of another company’s shares if in their view such acquisition will not be anti-competitive. Banks are also allowed to acquire shares greater than 5% of other financial establishments.\nPrevention of money laundering\nThe Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds and the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act requires all banks and other financial institutions to perform a high degree of due diligence in relation to their clients. Banks are required to ascertain a prospective client’s identity and perform background checks before allowing the opening of new accounts. Significant transactions and transfers are also subject to due diligence. The onus to report any suspicious activities falls on the banks.\nPeople who have bank accounts in Japan are protected under the Depositor Protection Law and the Deposit Insurance Act. The former entitles banking customers to, in certain circumstances, look to the bank for compensation in cases of credit or debit card fraud, for instance in situations where a credit or debit card is stolen or faked.\nThe Deposit Insurance Act attempts to safeguard the deposits of customers in the event that a bank collapses. Ordinary deposits, for instance those in current accounts, are entitled to protection, while other types of deposits are insured on a limited basis.', 'With the increasing use and sophistication of technology, the potential for fraud to impact trade finance has increased significantly in recent years. Indeed, technology has allowed fraudsters to globalise their practices and both corporates and banks are under an ever increasing compliance burden just to keep pace. In this article we look at how the certainty of letters of credit may be impacted by wider fraudulent/illegal conduct and what can be done to mitigate the risks.\nInternational trade finance relies heavily on letters of credit (LCs). They secure quick, clean payment and are generally unaffected by the circumstances of the underlying commercial transaction. For this reason, they are ripe for abuse by criminal organisations as a means of laundering money or obtaining payment for corrupt or illegal purposes.\nIn such circumstances, whilst a bank may be justified in refusing to honour an LC where evidence of fraud is present it is not clear whether lesser levels of wrongdoing and/or underlying illegal conduct would allow the bank the same discretion.\nAt a time when the international community is increasing its cooperative implementation of robust anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) and anti-money laundering (AML) measures in international trade, it is at least possible that underlying ABC and AML will (in the future) affect the certainty of LCs.\nThe autonomous nature of LCs\nThe utility of LCs is in providing a guaranteed method of payment for exporters from a familiar and creditworthy financial institution. The key feature of an LC that achieves this function is the autonomy principle. By this principle, an issuing bank’s obligation to honour a draft on an LC is independent of the underlying contract to which the credit relates. Instead, the bank’s sole consideration is whether a request to honour is accompanied by documents which appear, on their face, to comply with the terms of the credit. In this way, LCs have been described as being as good as cash.\nThe fraud exception\nDespite the importance of certainty, unscrupulous sellers are not protected by the autonomy principle. The fraud exception enables buyers to restrain sellers from drawing on an LC, or issuing banks from honouring a credit, if the documents presented to the bank are tainted by fraud. Whilst the exception has been adopted around the globe, its precise scope is unclear and varies from country to country.\nA key area of contention is whether the exception extends to fraud in the underlying transaction or is confined to fraud in the documents presented under the LC. An example illustrating this distinction would be an American distributor purchasing 500kg of full-blood Wagyu beef with a marble score of 9 from an Australian exporter, secured by an LC for the purchase price. The Australian exporter ships 500kg of Wagyu beef, but fraudulently ships substantially inferior beef with a marble score of 4. If the invoice presented to the issuing bank described the product as ‘500kg of Wagyu beef with a marble score of 9’, this would amount to fraud in the documents. However, if the invoice merely described ‘500kg of Wagyu beef’, the fraud would be limited to the underlying transaction.\nThis question of the location of fraud is an important one because if the exception extends widely to fraud in the underlying transaction, this may open the door for courts to consider other disentitling conduct affecting the commercial deal.\nCourts in the United Kingdom have largely taken the narrow view. The general consensus there is that the exception is limited to circumstances where the seller fraudulently presents documents that contain, whether expressly or by implication, material representations of fact that are known to be untrue. However, there has not yet been a definitive judicial statement that the exception cannot extend to fraud that only resonates in the underlying contract and the position remains open. By comparison, in Canada the exception extends to fraud in the underlying transaction if it is of such a character as to make the demand of payment a fraudulent one. In the USA, the same result is achieved by Article 5-109 of the Revised Uniform Commercial Code, which extends the fraud exception to circumstances where honour of the presentation would ‘facilitate a material fraud’ on the issuer or applicant by the beneficiary. Similarly, in China, LC fraud will fall under the general principles of civil fraud laid down in Chinese law and the aggrieved party may apply to the court for payment to be suspended. The courts will treat such claims in accordance with the property preservation provisions of the civil procedure law of the PRC. However, if the bank has already made the payment, the court has no power to interfere or suspend the transaction.\nThe illegality exception\nWhile fraud allows a bank to refuse to honour an LC, it is not so clear whether illegality in the underlying transaction provides the same justification. In North America, the prevailing view is that no illegality exception exists. There is nothing in the Revised Uniform Commercial Code to excuse an issuing bank from paying because of supervening illegality. In Canada, courts have emphasised that LCs are not tainted by illegality in the underlying transaction. However, the possibility has been entertained in the UK. Courts there have contemplated cases where illegality would affect the enforceability of an LC. The cases include judicial comment that, for example, that the courts could not rationally enforce an LC that secured payment for the purchase of heroin or to facilitate the illegal sale of arms to Iraq. While the UK courts have contemplated the existence of an illegality exception in LC law, its nature and scope remains a vexed question. Amongst other things, it is unclear how far removed the illegality would have to be from the LC transaction to justify disturbing the autonomy principle. The bounds of the exception may need to be determined on a case by case basis. The potential for an illegality exception to justify refusing payment is an issue of increasing relevance given worldwide moves to counter bribery in international business and trade based money laundering.\nLCs ripe for abuse\nThe autonomous nature of LCs mean they are ripe for abuse whether through the provision of false documents evidencing shipping, insurance fraud or as a means of laundering money.\nIn addition, it is easy to see how bribery might arise in the LC process. For example, an exporter might promise to pay a bribe to the buyer’s agent in order to secure a lucrative sales contract. The exporter might then request an LC to cover an inflated sales price that incorporates the bribe.\nSimilarly, LCs provide an efficient mechanism for laundering money. Certain behaviours associated with international trade have been identified as indicative of money laundering. These include:\n- deal structures beyond the capability of a customer or involving improbable goods, origins, quantities or descriptions;\n- significant discrepancies between the description or value of goods on the documents stipulated under an LC;\n- significant or repeated amendments to or extensions of an LC that are not reasonably justified; and\n- transfers of funds to international jurisdictions associated with dangerous drugs or with weak anti-money laundering regimes.\nWith advances in technology the scope for fraud and the sophistication of those frauds has increased.\nABC and AML laws\nIn 1997, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) finalised theConvention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. The convention has since been ratified by 34 countries around the world. The United Nations Convention Against Corruption has been even more widely adopted. In line with their treaty obligations, Australia, the UK and the US have all criminalised bribery of foreign public officials in international trade. In the US, for example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 1977 criminalises the corrupt payments of anything of value to a foreign government official in order to secure an improper business advantage. Similar conduct is criminalised in Australia by the Criminal Code (Cth) and in the UK by the Bribery Act 2010.\nOn the AML front, Australian laws were beefed up in 2006 to align with international best practice to deter money laundering and terrorism financing. The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) is Australia’s cornerstone legislation. It adopts the practices of the Financial Action Task Force, an international intergovernmental organisation tasked with combatting money laundering. The Act imposes various AML obligations on financial institutions, including establishing robust AML programs, conducting customer due diligence and reporting suspicious activities to Australian authorities. The US and UK impose similar obligations on financial institutions operating in those countries.\nProtection mechanisms for banks\nThe potential recognition of an illegality exception to LCs begs the question: what does a bank need to do to detect illegality in the underlying transaction? Generally, a bank providing an LC will not have any visibility of the underlying transaction. However, this does not mean that banks cannot undertake robust due diligence at the LC application stage.\nABC due diligence\nIn 2006, an OECD working party developed recommendations designed to prevent bribery in export transactions. While the recommendations apply to official export credit providers that provide export credit insurance (ECI), the measures are transferable to the approval phase of an LC. Adopting those recommendations, issuers of LCs should consider:\n- requiring exporters to provide a declaration that neither they, nor anyone acting on their behalf, such as agents, have engaged in bribery in the transaction or have been charged with bribery offences in any country in the last five years;\n- verifying whether exporters are listed on publicly available debarment lists of the World Bank and other regional international banks;\n- requiring exporters to disclose any commissions or fees agreed to be paid to persons acting on an exporter’s behalf; and\n- if suspicions of bribery arise before an LC is approved, suspending the application, engaging in enhanced due diligence and refusing the application if bribery is substantiated.\nAML due diligence\nPrior to issuing an LC, AML laws require due diligence by an issuing bank to identify and verify the applicant. This can involve standard procedures at the account opening stage. The Wolfsberg Group recommends that this stage of due diligence consider the applicant’s countries of trades, the goods traded, the parties with whom the applicant deals and the location of any agents or third parties. If information indicates that high risk countries are involved or that relevant parties and goods are on sanctions or terrorist lists, the issuing bank should conduct further enquiries. Due diligence by the confirming, negotiating or advising bank (as the case may be) should mirror this process in respect of the beneficiary. The banks should also conduct due diligence on one another. It is highly recommended that counterparties utilise electronic screening tools to facilitate this process.\nOnce an LC is on foot, a bank’s means of reviewing the transaction are more limited. However, banks should continually review LC transactions using the latest technology and be alert to new parties or countries mentioned in documents presented under a credit.\nAlthough an illegality exception to LCs has been suggested, it is not yet clear whether these suggestions will crystallise into hard law. Instead, banks could require that a declaration in line with ABC and AML laws be presented as a condition of an LC. A declaration of this nature would require an exporter to assert that neither it, nor anyone acting on its behalf, has engaged in illegal conduct, bribery or used the transaction to launder money.\nIn practical terms, an issuing bank will generally become aware of illegality upon notice from the applicant, who may not wish to complete a sale that is affected by illegal conduct, bribery or money laundering. Even if the applicant can provide the bank with strong evidence of illegality, it is not clear whether the bank could refuse to honour the LC on that basis. However, if the bank was then presented with the beneficiary’s fraudulent declaration that neither bribery nor money laundering objectives had affected the transaction, the issuing bank would be firmly within the established fraud exception in refusing the pay.\nHow can banks minimise exposure?\nFor reputational reasons and as part of good corporate governance, banks have an interest in ensuring that the LCs they issue, confirm or negotiate are not used to further illegality, bribery or money laundering. In practice, there are some key steps that can be taken by a bank to mitigate the ever increasing risks\n- The most fundamental strategy is a robust and fulsome due diligence process at the LC application stage. Banks need to verify the identity of an LC applicant and be aware of the countries, goods and counterparties involved in a transaction – advances in technology and screening have made this process more exhaustive but not necessarily simpler from an operational perspective.\n- If due diligence procedures identify issues of high risk, banks should carefully monitor the transaction. While an issuing bank’s insight may be limited, continuous review of new parties, locations and goods specified in documents presented under an LC provides a means of ongoing due diligence.\n- Finally, banks might consider requiring an ABC/AML declaration to be presented as a condition of an LC. This would create a mechanism to refuse payment based on the fraud exception.']	['<urn:uuid:92fd1ae8-c5e9-40d6-b2f0-8bad638846e4>', '<urn:uuid:c1b07908-ee78-41a6-927f-2cb3eb2b97f5>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	11	75	2714

While the main celebration is primarily over 3 days, the Chinese New Year period can run until the 15th day of the new Lunar Year, with preparations and celebrations starting weeks before and after. Due to the Lunar cycle, Chinese New Year falls between the end of January and middle of February every year.	['All over the world the Chinese New Year will be celebrated by a billion people in China and millions also that right here in Southeast Asia. Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam all have huge number of Chinese immigrants some which have been living there for over hundreds of years but have still kept their traditions like the Chinese New Year. In fact Thailand has the highest number of Chinese immigrants in the world.\nThis Spring Festival uses the centuries old Chinese Lunar calendar which began back in 2698 BC making it much older that the traditional calendar used in the modern world, which is based on the Roman calendar. Every year of the Chinese calendar is associated with an animal and this year, 2016, is the year of the Monkey. It is believed that the animal association began when Buddha asked all the animals to meet him on the Chinese New Year around 500 BC and only 12 animals met him, so he decided to name these 12 years animal after each year on a rotating basis. For every different animal there are also different fortunes and luck that you are said to be born under.\nTo celebrate the New Year year families come together and bring in the new year with lots of food, gifts, fireworks, loud noises and parades.

Depending on how traditional or modern you are offerings can take many forms such as burning bank notes, giving red envelopes to family with money inside, lighting candles, and many more.\nThere are 3 major purposes of the Chinese New Year – to come together as a family, to bless in the New Year for good fortune and to celebrate the year you are leaving. Celebrations that take place outside of China focus more so on celebrations but in China you will find that more attention is paid to bring families together, and it is said that over the New Year in China, the biggest movement of people takes placesfor a holiday celebration in the world as hundreds of millions of Chinese people return from the cities that they work in back to their home villages. The country comes to a complete standstill and travel throughout the country is a nightmare with all train, buses, flights and roads becoming completely full and the country comes to a complete stop.\nEven though the New Year is mainly celebrated over the 3 days, the preparations and celebrations can start weeks before and after. The New Year period itself the celebrations run as long as the 15th day of the new Lunar Year. The Chinese New Year ends up falling between the end of January and middle of February every year because of the Lunar cycle and the main 3 days of the Festival include Spring Festival Eve, the Spring Festival and New Year’s Day.']	['<urn:uuid:1fa1ca5e-e51d-4918-89fc-812a07a6ec45>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	18	54	563
98	compare medical coder duties flossmoor palmer	Medical coders in both Flossmoor IL and Palmer AK have the same core duties - they analyze patient treatment records and assign universal codes (CPT, ICD, and HCPCS codes) for services provided. They must understand payer regulations and work with physician notes, patient charts, and lab/radiology reports. In both locations, improper coding can cost healthcare facilities thousands of dollars, making coders valuable team members who can work in various healthcare settings or from home.	"['How to Select a Medical Billing and Coding Online Training Program in Flossmoor 60422\nOnce you have decided to become part of the healthcare field by training to be a medical billing and coding clerk in Flossmoor IL, it’s important that you select the right program so that you receive the proper education to guarantee your success. As you probably know, healthcare is among the fastest growing fields in the Country, and a growing number of options are available both on campus and online to receive the training that you need. But just where does one start? Many future students begin by searching for programs that are within travelling distance of their residences and then comparing tuition. Or they may surf the internet looking for online schools and choose the cheapest one. But while cost and location are important factors when making your choice, they should not be the only ones when comparing medical billing and coding schools. Such qualifiers as reputation and accreditation must be considered as well. We will review a checklist of topics that you should ask the colleges you are evaluating in order to find out what you need to know before making your selection. Before we do that, let’s take a look at what medical billers and coders do and the training and certification options offered.\nMedical Coding Job Description\nMedical coders work on the front line of the billing systems for Flossmoor IL medical practices and healthcare organizations. Coders have the responsibility to examine the treatment records of patients and assign universal codes to all services provided. These services may be for diagnosis, medical or dental procedures, or any medical supplies or equipment used. There are various codes that are utilized in the conversion, including:\n- CPT codes (Current Procedural Terminology).\n- ICD codes (International Classification of Diseases).\n- HCPCS codes (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding).\nMedical coders rely on information from sources such as physician and nursing notes, patient charts, and radiology and lab reports. Coders must know not only what total services were provided for accurate reporting, but must have a working knowledge of all private payer and government regulations that impact coding as well. Improperly coded claims can lead to services not being covered, services being paid for at a lower rate, or the provider being penalized for fraudulent or improper billing. Since improper coding can actually cost Flossmoor IL physicians and medical facilities many thousands of dollars in earnings each year, a proficient medical coder is a necessary asset to the healthcare organization. They can work in every type of healthcare facility, including private practices, hospitals, clinics and urgent care centers. It is not unusual for experienced medical coders to work at home as an offsite employee or an independent contractor.\nMedical Biller Job Functions\nAs important as the medical coder’s function is, it would be for nothing without the contribution of the medical biller whose efforts produce revenue. Medical billing clerks are very important to Flossmoor IL medical facilities and are practically responsible for keeping their doors open. Frequently the biller and coder may be the same individual within a medical organization, but they can also be 2 individual professionals. When the coder has carried out her or his duty, the biller utilizes the codes supplied to fill out and submit claim forms to insurance carriers, Medicare or Medicaid. After being adjusted by the applicable organization, patients can then be billed for deductibles and other out of pocket expenses. On a routine basis, a medical biller can also do any of the following:\n- Confirm medical insurance benefits for patients and assist them with billing concerns or questions\n- Follow up on patient claims submitted and appeal those that have been declined\n- Work as an intermediary between the healthcare provider, the insurance companies and the patients for correct claim settlement\n- Create and manage Accounts Receivables reports\n- Create and take care of unpaid patient collections accounts\nMedical billers not only are employed by private practices, but also Flossmoor IL hospitals, urgent care facilities, medical groups or nursing homes. They may practice in any kind of medical facility that relies on the revenues generated by billing third party payers and patients.\nMedical Billing and Coding Online Programs and Certification\nIt’s essential that you get your instruction from a reputable school, whether it’s a technical school, vocational school or community college. Although it is not required in many cases to earn a professional certification, the school you enroll in should be accredited (more on the advantages of accreditation later). Most schools simply require that you have either a high school diploma or a GED to be eligible. The quickest way to become either a medical biller or coder (or both) is to obtain a certificate, which usually takes about 1 year to finish. An Associate Degree is also an option for a more expansive education, which for almost all programs calls for 2 years of studies. Bachelor’s Degrees for medical coding and billing are not widely offered. Once your training has been concluded, although not required in most states, you may desire to attain a professional certification. Certification is a great means for those new to the field to show potential employers that they are not only qualified but committed to their career. Just some of the organizations that provide certifications are:\n- American Academy of Professional Coders (AAPC).\n- Board of Medical Specialty Coding (BMSC).\n- The Professional Association of Healthcare Coding Specialists (PAHCS).\n- American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA).\nGraduating from an accredited medical coding and billing course, in conjunction with earning a professional certification, are the most effective ways to advance your new vocation and succeed in the rapid growing healthcare field.\nOnline Medical Billing and Coding Colleges\nIf you are interested in convenience and the flexibility of attending classes in your home, then selecting an medical billing and coding online course might be an excellent option. They can be especially attractive to students in Flossmoor IL who plan on going to school while still working or have additional commitments that make going to classes on campus challenging. And as an additional advantage, online colleges are frequently less expensive than the standard classroom options. Expenses for such things as tuition, study materials and commuting may be minimized or eliminated. But be careful, as not all online courses are reputable. For that reason it’s essential to establish that any online school you enroll in is accredited to ensure a superior education. We will review the benefits of accreditation in the next segment. Just be sure to confirm that any online instruction you are looking at is accredited by one of the national accrediting organizations, such as the Council on Higher Education Accreditation. So if you are dedicated enough to apply yourself to this style of learning, then obtaining your certificate or degree online might be the ideal choice for you.\nQuestions to Ask Online Medical Coder and Biller Programs\nOnce you have a better idea what a medical coder and biller does, along with what education options are offered, you need to begin the process of comparing colleges. But since there are numerous training options offered at community colleges and technical, trade and vocational schools online and within the Flossmoor IL area, you should have a ready list of questions in order to assess each one. And when you include all of the online programs that offer medical billing and coding classes, the project can become rather daunting. As we have already discussed, expense and location are going to be important issues, particularly if you have a limited budget and will be traveling to classes from your Flossmoor home. And confirming that the school and program are accredited must be part of your vetting process also. So let’s take a look at a few of the other questions that you should ask the colleges you are reviewing so that you can evaluate each one and make the best choice.\nIs the Online School Accredited? It’s essential that the program and school you pick are accredited by a highly regarded accrediting organization, for instance the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools. If it’s an online college, it might also earn accreditation from the Distance Education and Training Council, which focuses on online or distance education. Not only will accreditation help confirm that the education you get will be of the highest quality, it might help with your future employment in Flossmoor IL also. Many Flossmoor medical organizations will only hire entry level applicants that have completed an accredited medical coding and billing training program. And financial aid and student loans are in many cases only offered for programs that have received an accreditation.\nWhat is the Online Program’s Reputation? Before enrolling in a medical coding and billing college, find out what its ranking and reputation are among other schools. This is particularly important if you have no experience in the field, since potential employers will mostly be relying on the quality of your training. As we have discussed, verifying that the program is accredited is a first step. Checking with school rating organizations, such as U.S. News and World Report, can confirm the quality of the school also. Another option is to check with several Flossmoor IL healthcare organizations that you might be interested in working for and ask which schools they suggest. Keep in mind that even when the college itself does not have an outstanding reputation, its medical coding and billing program may still be well regarded.\nIs there an Employment Referral Program? Finding employment after graduating in your new field can be challenging without the support of a job assistance program. Find out if the colleges you are reviewing have job placement programs in the Flossmoor IL area and what their job placement rates are. A high and rapid placement rate is an excellent indication that the billing and coding college has a considerable network of healthcare employers where they can place their graduates. It also implies that the college’s graduates are sought after in the marketplace.\nWhere is the College’s Location ? If you are anticipating driving to class from your Flossmoor IL home, then the location of the college will be of significant importance. Naturally if you enroll in an online medical billing and coding program, then the location of the school will not be a consideration. One thing to bear in mind is that if you attend classes at a community or junior college, many require a higher tuition for enrollees that reside outside of their districts. So you may want to first consider those colleges that are within your local area.\nWhat is the Complete Expense? Medical billing and coding certification programs can differ in cost depending on the type of credential obtained and the length of training provided. But remember, tuition is not the only expense for your education. Costs also consist of such items as the cost of books, supplies and commuting. Financial aid might be obtainable to help offset a portion of the expense, so make sure to get in touch with the school’s financial assistance department to find out what is available in 60422. Naturally if you decide to enroll in an online college, a portion of these added costs, particularly for commuting may be reduced or even eliminated.\nAre Classes Accessible that Accommodate your Schedule? A number of students continue working while attending school and need a flexible class schedule. If you can only attend classes at night or on weekends near Flossmoor IL, make sure that they are offered at those times. If you can only enroll on a part time basis, check that the school you enroll in offers that alternative. Also, ask what the process is for making up classes missed because of illness, work or family responsibilities.\nAttending Online Billing and Coding Classes in Flossmoor Illinois?\nIf you live in the greater Flossmoor IL area and will be attending Online Medical Billing and Coding Classes from home, the following information may be both interesting and informative about your local stomping grounds.\nThe village is renowned for the quality and architectural variety of its housing stock, as well as its proximity to numerous country clubs.

So let’s review several of the additional questions that you should ask the colleges you are considering so that you can compare each one and make the best choice.\nIs the School Accredited? It’s important that the school and program you pick are accredited by a respected accrediting organization, for instance the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools. If it’s an online college, it can also earn accreditation from the Distance Education and Training Council, which focuses on distance or online education. Not only will accreditation help ensure that the training you get will be of the highest quality, it may help secure future employment also. A number of Palmer AK healthcare facilities will only hire entry level applicants that have completed an accredited medical billing and coding educational program. And financial assistance and student loans are frequently only offered for schools that have earned an accreditation.\nWhat is the Program’s Reputation? Before enrolling in a medical billing and coding college, check out what its reputation and ranking are among other colleges. This is particularly important if you have no experience in the industry, since potential employers will primarily be evaluating you based on the quality of your education. As we have covered, verifying that the college is accredited is a first step. Checking with college rating organizations, for instance U.S. News and World Report, can confirm the quality of the school also. Another option is to check with a few Palmer AK healthcare organizations that you might have an interest in working for and find out which programs they recommend. Remember that even if the college itself does not have an outstanding reputation, its medical billing and coding program may still be highly regarded.\nIs there an Employment Assistance Program? Finding employment in Palmer AK after graduating in your new field may be difficult without the help of a job assistance program. Find out if the colleges you are reviewing have job assistance programs and what their job placement rates are. A high and rapid placement rate is an excellent indication that the billing and coding college has a considerable network of medical care employers where they can refer their graduates. It also suggests that the school’s graduates are sought after in the marketplace.\nWhere is the College’s Location? If you are intending on commuting to class from your Palmer AK residence, then the location of the campus will be of prime importance. Of course if you choose an medical billing and coding online program, then the location of the college will not be a consideration. One thing to remember is that if you go to classes at a community or junior college, most charge a higher tuition for enrollees that live outside of their districts. So you may prefer to first consider those schools that are within your local area.\nWhat is the Complete Expense? Medical billing and coding certification programs can differ in cost based on the type of credential obtained and the length of training provided. But remember, tuition is not the only cost of your education. Expenditures also consist of such items as the cost of supplies, books and commuting. Financial assistance may be accessible to help reduce a portion of the cost, so make sure to check with the school’s financial aid department to see what is available in Palmer AK. Naturally if you decide to attend an online school, a portion of these additional costs, such as for commuting may be reduced or even eliminated.\nAre Classes Offered that Fit your Schedule? A number of students continue working while attending school and require a convenient class schedule. If you can only attend classes during the evenings or on weekends near Palmer AK, make sure that they are available at those times. If you can only enroll on a part time basis, make sure that the program you enroll in provides that alternative. Also, ask what the procedure is for making up classes missed due to illness, work or family emergencies.\nConsidering Medical Billing and Coding School near Palmer AK?\nIf you are considering enrolling in and attending a billing and coding school near Palmer AK, following is some relevant information about the area that may aid in your decision making process.\nPalmer is a city in and the borough seat of the Matanuska-Susitna Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska. It is part of the Anchorage Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2010 census, the population of the city is 5,937.\nThe first people to live in the Matanuska Valley, where Palmer is located, were the Dena'ina and Ahtna Athabaskans. They moved throughout the area, living a subsistence lifestyle and trading with other native groups. Their trade routes were along the Matanuska River. Russians came to Alaska in 1741 and brought the Russian Orthodox religious tradition to the indigenous peoples of the region. In the early 1890s, an entrepreneur named George W. Palmer built a trading post on the Matanuska River, near present-day Palmer. The town was later named after Palmer.\nIn the late 19th century, the U.S. government began to take interest in the Matanuska coal fields located north of Palmer. This interest sparked financiers to consider constructing the Alaska Central Railroad in 1904. The advent of World War I created a need for high quality coal to fuel U.S. battleships, and by 1917 the US Navy had constructed rail from the port of Seward to the Chickaloon coal deposits. At the end of World War I, the U.S. Navy distributed land in the coal fields to war veterans and additional land was opened to homesteading. Farmers, miners and homesteaders began to populate the area. The Palmer Post Office was opened July 6, 1917 under the name of Warton. With railroad accessibility, new markets for agriculture began to open up for farmers in the Matanuska Valley.\nChoose the Best Medical Biller and Coder Training near Palmer AK\nPicking the right medical billing and coding certificate or degree course is a critical first step to help guarantee your success in this rewarding field of medical care. Medical coding and medical billing are two of the fastest expanding jobs in the health sector. Because of this, there are numerous vocational schools, community colleges and companies that provide instruction and training in medical coding and billing. As we have reviewed, you can decide to attend classes either on campus or online. It’s also imperative that the school you select has an accredited program with an exceptional reputation within the healthcare field. But however you choose to receive your training, by following the previous guidelines and asking the appropriate questions, you will be better able to evaluate your options and select the ideal college. And with the appropriate training, you can achieve your career objective to become a medical billing and coding clerk in Palmer AK.\nMore Marvelous Cities in Alaska""]"	['<urn:uuid:ba708d1a-ba1c-4a5e-a85a-57bcd4e12aeb>', '<urn:uuid:de204d9d-cc2f-469b-bed8-7be44199f615>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	6	74	4845
99	experienced surgeon need comparison stapler suture infection healing rates safety concerns	Regarding infection rates and safety, skin closure with surgical staples may cause fewer infections than traditional sutures. Staples are quicker to insert and allow for faster patient healing, particularly useful in C-sections and abdominal surgeries. However, there are significant safety concerns with surgical staplers. From 2011 to 2018, there were nearly 110,000 reported stapler malfunctions or injuries, including 366 deaths and over 9,000 serious injuries. The FDA has taken action by reclassifying surgical staplers from low-risk to moderate-risk devices. Common complications for both methods include wound infection, with signs such as redness, increasing pain, swelling, and fever. For staples specifically, complications can include bleeding, permanent organ damage, and incomplete staple formation. Both closure methods require proper wound care to prevent infection, including keeping the site clean and dry.	['Facts about and Definition of Removing Stitches (Sutures)\nAmong the many methods for closing wounds of the skin, stitching, or suturing, is the most common form of repairing a wound. Other methods include surgical staples, skin closure tapes, and adhesives.Removing stitches or other skin-closure devices is a procedure that many people dread. Understanding the various skin-closure procedures and knowing how they are put in and what to expect when they are removed can help overcome much of this anxiety.\nStitches (also called sutures) are used to close cuts and wounds in skin. They can be used in nearly every part of the body, internally and externally. Doctors literally “sew” the skin together with individual sutures and tie a secure knot. Stitches then allow the skin to heal naturally when it otherwise may not come together. Stitches are used to close a variety of wound types. Accidental cuts or lacerations are often closed with stitches. Also, surgeons use stitches during operations to tie ends of bleeding blood vessels and to close surgical incisions.\nSutures are divided into two general categories, namely, absorbable and nonabsorbable. Absorbable suturesrapidly break down in the tissues and lose their strength within 60 days. This type of suture does not have to be removed. These are used to close skin and for other internal uses where a permanent stitch is not needed. Nonabsorbable sutures, on the other hand, maintain their strength for longer than 60 days. These sutures are used to close skin, external wounds, or to repair blood vessels, for example. They may require removal depending on where they are used, such as once a skin wound has healed.\nThe general technique of placing stitches is simple. The “thread” or suture that is used is attached to a needle. The wound is usually cleaned with sterile water and peroxide. Betadine, an antiseptic solution, is used to cleanse the area around the wound. Next, the area is numbed with an anesthetic agent such as lidocaine (Xylocaine). Then the needle with the thread attached is used to “sew” the edges of the wound together, in an effort to recreate the original appearance. Several stitches may be needed to accomplish this. Once the wound is closed a topical antibiotic gel is often spread over the stitches and a bandage is initially applied to the wound. All sutured wounds that require stitches will have scar formation, but the scarring is usually minimal.\nSurgical staples are useful for closing many types of wounds. Staples have the advantage of being quicker and may cause fewer infections than stitches. Disadvantages of staples are permanent scars if used inappropriately and imperfect aligning of the wound edges, which can lead to improper healing. Staples are used on scalp lacerations and commonly used to close surgical wounds.\nSkin closure tapes, also known as adhesive strips, have recently gained popularity. The advantages of skin closure tapes are plenty. The rate of wound infection is less with adhesive strips than with stitches. Also, it takes less time to apply skin closure tape. For many people, there is no need for a painful injection of anesthetic when using skin closure tapes. Disadvantages of using skin closure tapes include less precision in bringing wound edges together than suturing. Not all areas of the body can be taped. For example, body areas with secretions such as the armpits, palms, or soles are difficult areas to place adhesive strips. Areas with hair also would not be suitable for taping.\nAdhesive agents can be used to close a wound. This material is applied to the edges of the wound somewhat like glue and should keep the edges of the wound together until healing occurs. Adhesive glue is the newest method of wound repair and is becoming a popular alternative to stitches, especially for children. The adhesive simply falls off or wears away after about 5-7 days.\nHow to Prepare for Removing Stitches (Sutures)\nIf a person has received stitches, they should be given instructions for taking care of the stitches and wound, and be given an approximate date to have the stitches removed. A sample of such instructions includes:\n- Keep wound clean and dry for the first 24 hours.\n- Showering is allowed after 48 hours, but do not soak the wound.\n- Bandages can safely be removed from the wound after 48 hours, unless the wound continues to bleed or has a discharge. If bandages are kept in place\n- An antibiotic ointment (brand names are Polysporin or Neosporin, for example) should be used after the wound is cleaned.\n- Notify the doctor if a suture loosens or breaks.\n- When scheduled to have the stitches removed, be sure to make an appointment with a person qualified to remove the stitches.\nget wet, the wet bandage should be replaced with a clean dry bandage.\nDifferent parts of the body require suture removal at varying times. Common periods of time for removal are as follows, but times vary according to the health care professionals that perform the procedure:\n- Face: 3-5 days\n- Scalp: 7-10 days\n- Trunk: 7-10 days\n- Arms and legs: 10-14 days\n- Joints: 14 days\nSutures may be taken out all at one visit, or sometimes, they may be taken out over a period of days if the wound requires it.\nRemoval of Stitches (Sutures)\nThe wound is cleaned with an antiseptic to remove encrusted blood and loosened scar tissue. Sterile forceps (tongs or pincers) are used to pick up the knot of each suture, and then surgical scissors or a small knife blade is used to cut the suture. Forceps are used to remove the loosened suture and pull the thread from the skin. These relatively painless steps are continued until the sutures have all been removed. You may feel a tug or slight pull as a stitch is removed. The wound is cleansed again. Adhesive strips are often placed over the wound to allow the wound to continue strengthening.\nStaple removal is a simple procedure and is similar to suture removal. Doctors use a special instrument called a staple remover. After cleansing the wound, the doctor will gently back out each staple with the remover. The doctor applies pressure to the handle, which bends the staple, causing it to straighten the ends of the staple so that it can easily be removed from the skin. The staple backs out of the skin the very same direction in which it was placed. People may feel a pinch or slight pull. The process is repeated until all staples are removed. The wound is cleansed a second time, and adhesive strips are applied. This is also a relatively painless procedure.\nSuture Removal and Healing Time for Wounds\nWound care after suture removal is just as important as it was prior to removal of the stitches. Take good care of the wound so it will heal and not scar.\n- Keep adhesive strips on the wound for about 5 days. Then soak them for removal. Do not peel them off.\n- Continue to keep the wound clean and dry.\n- Skin regains tensile strength slowly. At the time of suture removal, the wound has only regained about 5%-10% of its strength. Therefore, protect the wound from injury during the next month.\n- Injured tissue also requires additional protection from sun’s damaging ultraviolet rays for the next several months. The use of sunscreen during this period of healing is advised for those areas that are exposed.\n- The use of vitamin E topically has also been suggested to be helpful in the healing process of the damaged skin. This should only be considered once the skin edges are healed and are closed together.\nWhen to Call a Doctor after Suture Removal\nCall a doctor if you have any of these signs and symptoms after stitches (sutures) have been removed, redness, increasing pain, swelling, fever, red streaks progressing away from the sutured site, material (pus) coming from out of the wound, if the wound reopens, and bleeding.\nComplications of Removing Stitches\nWound infection: If signs of infection begin, such as redness, increasing pain, swelling, and fever, contact a doctor immediately.\nWound reopening: If sutures are removed too early, or if excessive force is applied to the wound area, the wound can reopen. The doctor may restitch the wound or allow the wound to close by itself naturally to lessen the chances of infection.\nExcessive scarring: All wounds will form a scar, and it will take months for a scar to completely contract and remodel to its permanent form. However, scarring may be excessive when sutures are not removed promptly or left in place for a prolonged period of time. This may result in a scar with the appearance of a “railroad track.”\nKeloid formation: A keloid is a large, firm mass of scarlike tissue. This scarring extends beyond the original wound and tends to be darker than the normal skin. Keloids are common in wounds over the ears, waist, arms, elbows, shoulders, and especially the chest. Keloids occur when the body overreacts when forming a scar. They are common in African Americans and in anyone with a history of producing keloids. People with a tendency to form keloids should be closely monitored by the doctor. Injection of anti-inflammatory agents may decrease keloid formation. Also, large keloids can be removed, and a graft can be used to close the wound.\nHypertrophic scars: Bulky scars can remain within the boundaries of the original wound. These occur mostly around joints. Hypertrophic scars tend to develop a peak size and then get smaller over months to years. Keloids, on the other hand, rarely go away. For people with hypertrophic scars, a firm pressure dressing may aid in preventing them from forming.', 'Surgical Staplers and Staples\nSurgical staplers and staples are medical devices that may be used in place of sutures. They can close large wounds or incisions more quickly and be less painful than stitches for patients. They are often used in minimally invasive surgery. They can also be used to close wounds in areas where skin is tight against bone, in operations to remove organs or to reconnect parts of internal organs.\nSurgical staplers are generally made of plastic and loaded with a disposable cartridge of surgical staples. The staplers come in both reusable and disposable models. They resemble construction or industrial staplers and are designed to insert and close several staples at once.\nThe devices may be used internally to seal tissue during surgery. They are useful in minimally invasive surgery because they require only a narrow opening and can quickly cut and seal tissue and blood vessels. Skin staplers are used externally to close skin under high tension, such as on the skull or the trunk of the body.\n- They can be inserted quickly.\n- They’re strong.\n- They are easily removed with a surgical staple remover.\n- They reduce the amount of time a patient is in surgery and under anesthesia.\nWhen Are Surgical Staplers Used?\nSurgical staplers are frequently used to close incisions in the abdomen and uterus during Cesarean deliveries, or C-sections, since the staples allow women to heal faster and reduce scar tissue. Surgeons may also rely on surgical staplers when removing part of an organ or cutting through organs and tissue inside the body.\nThey are also used to connect or reconnect internal organs within an organ system. The devices are frequently used for surgeries involving the digestive tract, including the esophagus, stomach and intestines, in which a portion of these tube-like structures have been removed and the remaining portions must be reconnected.\nCaring for Surgical Staples\nPatients must pay special attention to medical staples in the skin to avoid infection. Always follow your doctor’s instructions and do not remove any dressings until it’s safe to do so. Rinse the site twice daily to keep it clean. Your doctor will tell you how and when to dress the wound to prevent infection.\n- Bleeding enough to soak through the bandage\n- Brown, green or yellow foul-smelling pus around the incision\n- Change in color of the skin around the incision\n- Difficulty moving in the area around the incision\n- Dryness, darkened skin or other changes around the site\n- Fever of 100 degrees or higher for more than 4 hours\n- New, severe pain\n- Cold, pale or tingling skin near the incision site\n- Swelling or redness around the incision\nRemoving Surgical Staples\nSurgical staples usually remain in place for one to two weeks, depending on the type of surgery and the placement of the staples. In some cases, internal staples may not be removed. They are either absorbed or become permanent additions to hold internal tissue together.\nRemoving surgical staples from the skin is generally not painful. But they should be removed only by a doctor. Never attempt to remove surgical staples on your own.\nRemoval requires a sterile setting and a specialized surgical staple remover or extractor. The device spreads one staple at a time, allowing the doctor to gently work it out of the skin.\nUsually, a doctor will remove every other staple, and a second appointment is scheduled to remove the rest if the wound has not completely healed.\nHow Surgical Staplers Work\nSurgical staplers work by compressing tissue, connecting two pieces of tissue with staggered rows of B- shaped surgical staples and, in some models, cutting away excess tissue to create a clean closure of the surgical wound.\nThere are various designs for different types of surgeries, with most categorized as either linear or circular.\nWhen using linear staplers, the surgeon uses the handles at one end to close the “jaws” of the stapler at the other end over the tissue. When the surgeon fires the stapler, a row of staples binds the tissue together and a blade cuts the tissue between the staples. The process seals the open wound to prevent bleeding.\nLinear staplers are used to connect tissue during minimally invasive surgeries or to remove an organ. Circular staplers are often used for surgeries involving the digestive tract from the throat to the colon.\nCircular staplers fire two staggered rows of staples from a circular cartridge. This circular layout allows the stapler to connect two sections of the intestine, or another tube-like structure, after a portion has been removed. The staples cause tissue to pinch up as rings or donuts between the staples. A built-in blade then slices off the overlaying tissue, sealing the new connection.\nSurgeons watch the closed wound for about 30 seconds to make sure the tissue has been squeezed together properly and confirm that there is no bleeding.\nWhat Are Surgical Staples Made Of?\nCommon materials for surgical staples include stainless steel and titanium. These are both strong metals that tend to cause few problems for patients in surgical procedures.\nBut plastic staples are frequently used for people with metal allergies or to reduce scar tissue.\nStaples made from plastic or metals don’t dissolve like many sutures, so extra attention must be paid to prevent infection.\nStaples made from polylactide-polyglycolide copolymer are designed to be reabsorbed into the body. They are often used in cosmetic surgery because, like plastic staples, they result in less scaring.\nSurgical Stapler Manufacturers\nJohnson and Johnson’s Ethicon division and Medtronic are the two largest surgical stapler manufacturers. Together, they produced about 80 percent of the stapler market in 2015, according to an analysis by Future Market Insights. 3M also manufacturers skin staplers sold in the United States.\nThe devices accounted for close to $2 billion in revenue for manufacturers in 2016, with most sold in North America.\n- Echelon series, Contour Curved Cutter, Endo-Surgery series, Proximate series\n- Signia Stapling System, Endo GIA series of staplers, iDrive Ultra Powered Stapling System, DST series, Premium Plus CEEA Staplers, Appose Single Use Skin Stapler, DFS Single Use Fascia Stapler, Roticulator series, DST Single Use series, ILA series, GIA Single Use and Reusable series\nSurgical Stapler Recalls and Injuries\nJohnson & Johnson subsidiary Ethicon recalled 92,496 surgical staplers in April 2019 over concerns that they might not fire with enough force to completely form staples.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration branded the recall as a Class I recall, the FDA’s most serious type. The agency warned in a statement that the devices could cause serious injuries or death. Some people who have been injured by malfunctioning devices have suffered serious injuries and filed surgical stapler lawsuits.\nThe recall affected two models of the company’s Endo-Surgery Intraluminal Staplers used in gastrointestinal tract surgeries.\nEthicon reported that two patients had been injured by the devices, according to the FDA. In both cases, the devices misfired, cutting portions of the rectum. Misfires or other malfunctions can prolong operations or require doctors to perform unplanned surgery to correct the damage.\nThe FDA warned that the misfires could increase complications from surgical staplers, including the risk for bleeding, infection, permanent damage to organs.\nIn 2015, Ethicon recalled 6,744 Endopath Echelon Flex Powered Vascular Staplers with Advanced Placement Tip and White Reloads. The devices were used in gynecologic, urologic, thoracic, pediatric and general minimally invasive surgeries.\nThe company reported that an inspection had found the surgical staplers’ cartridges may not insert a complete line of staples when fired.\nMedtronic issued two recalls of its Endo GIA staplers and staple cartridges from select production lots, or batches, in 2018 and 2019. Both recalls involved possible missing components. The company said the defects could affect staple alignment and lead to serious complications.\nAt least five people were injured by staplers included in the 2018 recall, according to the company. The 2019 recall involved defects in staple cartridges that were spotted during the manufacturing process. The company reported “no confirmed complaints” about the devices from doctors or patients.\nFDA Actions on Surgical Staplers\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration began tightening restrictions and reporting safety concerns over surgical staplers in 2019. It issued new guidance for using the devices to doctors and hospitals, took steps to reclassify certain surgical staplers from low- to moderate-risk devices and reported tens of thousands of previously unknown cases of stapler malfunctions and injuries.\nThe new classification would require premarket review and clearance of the devices from the FDA before manufacturers could sell them.\nThe FDA actions followed a series of surgical stapler problems coming to light earlier in 2019. Kaiser Health News reported that more than half of all surgical stapler malfunctions from 2011 through 2018, 56,000 of them, had been reported to a hidden FDA database instead of a database accessible by the public.\nThe FDA consolidated the two databases so all the reports could be viewed by the public. The total number of reported surgical stapler malfunctions over the eight-year period rose from 41,000 to nearly 110,000.\nJan. 1, 2011 to March 31, 2018\nThe FDA received over 41,000 individual medical device reports to its public database for surgical staplers and staples for internal use. The reports included 366 deaths, more than 9,000 serious injuries and more than 32,000 malfunctions.\nMarch 8, 2019\nThe FDA sent a letter to health care providers expressing concerns about an increasing number of adverse events associated with surgical staplers and staples for internal use.\nApril 11, 2019\nEthicon recalled circular staplers for insufficient firing and failure to completely form staples. The FDA identified the recall as Class I.\nApril 23, 2019\nThe FDA issued a draft guidance to help manufacturers develop labeling with information about specific risks, limitations and directions for use of the device.\nApril 24, 2019\nThe FDA issued a proposed order that would reclassify surgical staplers for internal use from Class I (low risk) to Class II (moderate risk) medical devices with special controls.\nMay 30, 2019\nThe FDA held an open public meeting of the General and Plastic Surgery Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee to discuss whether reclassifying surgical staplers for internal use as Class II medical devices would be appropriate. (The advisory panel reportedly recommended switching the devices to a higher-risk classification with additional safety requirements.)\nMay 30, 2019\nA Kaiser Health News report revealed that the FDA acknowledged that more than 56,000 additional surgical stapler malfunctions were quietly reported to the agency from 2011 through 2018, bringing the total to 110,000 malfunctions or injuries during that time period.\nPlease seek the advice of a medical professional before making health care decisions.']	['<urn:uuid:a0a53511-3534-42c8-88ad-b24ba7b48897>', '<urn:uuid:f59d8112-93d5-4e3c-8975-25b6a5a7c946>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	11	128	3405
100	studying naval warfare 1798 1805 period comparison napoleon bonaparte naval campaign egypt vs nelson mediterranean operations effectiveness	Napoleon's 1798 Egyptian naval campaign initially succeeded with the capture of Alexandria and Cairo, but suffered a decisive defeat when Nelson's British fleet destroyed 17 French ships at the Battle of the Nile, cutting off Napoleon's army from France and forcing him to abandon his troops in 1799. In contrast, Nelson's Mediterranean operations, particularly commanding from HMS Victory as Commander in Chief Mediterranean Fleet from 1803, culminated in the decisive victory at Trafalgar in 1805, where the British fleet destroyed 22 Franco-Spanish ships without losing any of their own vessels, though Nelson was mortally wounded during the battle.	"[""1792-1796: War in France and the Lowlands\nAfter the French Revolution succeeded in overthrowing Louis XVI and establishing the French Republic, the many nations of Europe united in the First Coalition to fight the revolutionaries and put the Bourbon's back on the French throne. The Holy Roman Empire, Prussia, and Britain led the charge by invading France through the north and th east, pushing deep into France, and leaving the fate of the Revolution in doubt. But finally on September 20, 1792, Charles Francois Dumouriez led 47,000 French to victory at Valmy to a decisive victory and created a stalemate in the east. As the stalemate was broken and Franc began to win many more victories, the Prussian and Holy Romans lost too many men and were forced to retreat, ending the invasion of France. Meanwhile, the British attempted an attack on southern France's ports, including Toulon, in an attempt to nulify the French Mediterranean Fleet. During the battle of Toulon, Napoleon Bonaparte at this point took the advantage of France's geographical position in Toulon, and fired his cannons on the British ships, which later retreated. Napoleon then took part in the land battle, which drove the invaders from the port, but also forced the French Mediterranean fleet to stay in port a few years. This battle launched the career of Napoleon Bonaparte, who was then promoted to Brigadier General, and brought him to the attention of the Parisian political elite.\nThe next phase of the war took place in the European Lowlands, which had occupied by the British and Prussians. The French fought in the Lowlands for four years, and the war there eventually stretched into the Rhineland even, and the over-extended invaders were forced to retreat from both fronts. The retreat led to France annexes much of the Rhineland and Belgium, and the Netherlands being reformed into the Batavian Republic, a French client state, the first of many.\n1796-1797: War in Italy\nWith the war in the Rhineland and the Lowlands nearing its ends, Napoleon was transfered from Southern France to lead France's latest campaign in Italy. Although France was not facing defeat in the Rhineland, Napoleon was achieving total success in Italy, defeating Austria and Sardinia in the northwest, and forcing a peace upon Sardinia after capturing Milan. And then went on to finish off the Austrians in the Northeast, and then established a client state in northern Italy, the Cisalpine Republic.\nAfter the multiple victories of France in this time, Spain signed a treaty, which also brought Spain onto the side of France, in return for territories in Italy, which would later be nullified in the First European Wars. Britain, as a result of this, withdrew all of its forces from Corsica, and began to put more fortifications in Gibraltar.\nNapoleon captured Mantua, after a long siege, and with it 18,000 Austrians, and further moves by France forced the Austrians to sue for peace in April 1797. The Treaty of Campo Formio in October forced the Coalition to give control of the Lowlands to France, as well as of the Rhineland. The Republic of Venice was then also partitioned into two parts, part to France and part to Austria, ending the country's 1100 years of existence.\n1798-1800: War in Egypt\nThe peace that had ended the first part of the French Revolutionary Wars was short lived, as the next year in 1798, the French were again at war with a new Coalition made up of Britain, Russia, and Austria. In 1798, Napoleon led his Armée d'Orient into Egypt in an attempt to overthrow the Mamluk and Ottoman rule in the area, as well as cut of British trade with India. Thirteen days after leaving for Egypt, Napoleon captured Alexandria and then moved south to capture the rest of Egypt. On July 21, 1798, after the Battle of the Pyramids allowed Napoleon to capture Cairo and forced the Ottomans and Mamelukes to retreat from Egypt into Syria. But ten days later, at the Battle of the Nile, Horatio Nelson and his British fleet of 15 ships defeated 17 French ships, resulting in Egypt being cut off from France and Napoleon then returned to France in August 1799, leaving his army behind, which would later be forced to surrender in 1800.\nIn November 1799, Napoleon led a coup d'etat and established a new French government with him as First Consul. The position in which he remained in until becoming Emperor in 1804, and establishing the French Empire.\n1800-1802: War in the Rhineland and the Treaty of Amiens\nThe French invaded Bavaria in 1800 under General Moreau, after a short campaign, he fought the Austrians at Hohenlinden, winning a decisive victory on December 3, and forcing the Austrians to accept another peace. The Treaty of Luneville forced the Austrians to accept the Treaty of Campo Formio and was a another humiliating defeat of Austria. The British signed the Treaty of Amiens with France in 1802, which is accepted by historian as the transitional device between the French Revolutionary Wars and the First European War. Peace would be broken the next year, an event that forever plagued many of Europe's rulers after its results were shown."", 'The topic of today’s post?

The cost in modern money equates to around £46.5 million.\n7th May 1765: 6 years, and around 6000 trees later, Victory is launched but moved to the Medway as part of a reserve fleet.\nMarch 1778: Victory is commissioned to celebrate the Annus Mirabilis (year of miracles) of 1759, where the British managed a string of military victories over the French.\nMay 1778: Victory becomes the flagship of Admiral Augustus Keppel, in command of the Channel Fleet.\nJuly 1778: The First Battle of Ushant: Keppel’s fleet of around 30 ships engages a French fleet of 29, at Ushant.\nDecember 1781: The Second Battle of Ushant: Victory is now the flagship of Vice-Admiral Richard Kempenfelt who, whilst flying his flag in Victory, takes part in the Second Battle of Ushant. 12 British ships captured 15 French transport ships and around 1500 soldiers and seamen.\nOctober 1782: Victory becomes the flagship for Admiral Richard Howe, famous for his role in the Battle of Quiberon Bay in 1759. He also commanded the British fleet during the Glorious First of June in 1794. In 1782, Howe was tasked with ensuring the safe arrival of transport ships to Gibraltar, carrying supplies for the fleet. A number of Howe’s ships were forced in to the Mediterranean by strong currents, and the Franco-Spanish fleet followed them from Algeciras. The British regrouped East of Gibraltar and eventually managed to deliver all supplies safely. As they left Gibraltar the Spanish fleet followed and HMS Victory took part in the Battle of Cape Spartel. This was an indecisive battle and Howe sailed back to England afterwards.\nFebruary 1797: Admiral Sir John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent, known for his victory at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in February 1797 and Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean fleet.\n“His importance lies in his being the organiser of victories; the creator of well-equipped, highly efficient fleets; and in training a school of officers as professional, energetic, and devoted to the service as himself.” – P.K Crimmin\n1800: Victory undergoes a major refit, with an increased number of guns, a new figurehead and masts and is decorated in the famous “Nelson Chequer”\n1803: Refit complete, at a cost of around £70,000, Victory sailed for Portsmouth, where Horatio Nelson raised his flag on the ship after being made Commander in Chief Mediterranean Fleet.\nAt this time she was already flagged under Admiral Cornwallis, however, upon realising that the ship was not ready for sea, Nelson sailed for the Mediterranean on a different ship, HMS Amphion. Cornwallis declined the opportunity to raise his flag on the Victory and so, after having been made ready for sea and reaching the Mediterranean, Horatio Nelson once more raised his flag onboard the Victory with Thomas Masterman Hardy as Captain.\nAugust 1805: Nelson, onboard Victory, joined Admiral Cornwallis’ Channel Fleet at Ushant, before sailing for England. The Mediterranean fleet, under Cornwallis, sails for Ferrol, Galicia.\nSeptember 14th 1805: Horatio Nelson makes his final voyage from Portsmouth on the Victory, alongside HMS Euryalus.\nOctober 21st 1805: The Battle of Trafalgar. The Victory’s most famous battle, against the Franco-Spanish fleet, under Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson. Victory headed up one column with the other being headed up by Royal Sovereign.\nThe British lost no ships, the Franco-Spanish fleet lost 22. Horatio Nelson was shot on board the Victory and died on the Orlop Deck later in the day after hearing of his victory.\nVictory was badly damaged at Trafalgar and was towed to Gibraltar after the battle for repairs. The extent of the damage was so bad that the ship could not sail.\nAfter refit, Nelson’s body was taken back to England on board the Victory for his funeral at St Paul’s Cathedral in January 1806.\n1812: Victory’s career as an active warship was over, and so was moored in Portsmouth Harbour to be used as a depot ship.\n1889: Victory became a Naval School of Telegraphy for signalling until 1904, when the school was made a permanent building in the dockyard.\n1921: The Victory was in a poor state after beginning to deteriorate whilst alongside at Portsmouth and the ‘Save the Victory’ campaign was launched.\n1922: Victory is moved in to dry dock at Portsmouth, as she was unable to remain afloat, she underwent a huge amount of restoration and structural repair.\n1941: Victory sustained a small amount of damage from a bomb dropped by the Luftwaffe. Part of the foremast was damaged (you can see part of the damage to this day). German propaganda claimed that they had destroyed the Victory and the Admiralty was forced to issue a denial to counter this claim.\n2015: Victory celebrated a 250th birthday and was repainted in a more historically accurate colour scheme. Still undergoing serious conservation work in order to ensure that the ship is stable, there are currently no top masts. The keel was dropping by around 0.5cm per year due to water damage and the dry dock cradle was putting a lot of stress on the hull.\nIf you want to visit HMS Victory, this incredible ship is part of Portsmouth Historic Dockyard – Click here for their website – For more information on opening times, prices etc…']"	['<urn:uuid:3f3110f4-272d-459f-873e-29f7e4bcc17f>', '<urn:uuid:164a7522-01fe-42db-9e98-391738440407>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T18:27:46.635605	17	98	1869
