1	mail delivery rural urban methods evolution	Mail delivery methods have evolved significantly in both rural and urban settings. In early Ponoka, rural mail delivery was initially handled by couriers on horseback or horse and buggy, later transitioning to automobiles. The mail was sorted and delivered to sub-post offices at various districts, but as the system modernized, small outlets closed and thousands of personal boxes were placed along rural roads, with large multi-boxes later installed in central locations. In urban areas, particularly New York City during the 1890s, an intricate pneumatic tube system was built 4 to 6 feet below the city's surface, capable of ejecting canisters full of mail at speeds of 35 miles per hour. At its peak, this system processed around 95,000 pieces of mail in just one day, continuing operations until 1953.	['During a rugged, colourful and progressive 80-year history the Calgary/Edmonton trail progressed from a crude pathway in an unexplored wilderness to a strategic highway in an ultra-modern Alberta civilization.\nBy 1881 the dirt cart trail had developed from Fort Edmonton to the Red Deer River, and would later be joined by the road from Calgary. At the same time the massive wooden ties and steel rails of the Calgary and Edmonton Railway were methodically being laid from the two major Alberta cities across the lush and rolling central prairies of Alberta.\nWith the completion of these major milestones of our history, the demand for the regular delivery of supplies and mail to our early pioneers grew and the first mail service between Edmonton and Calgary started in July 6, 1883, with Ad McPherson and John Coleman obtaining the contract. The hardy pair made regular fortnightly trips between the two points with their horse drawn wagon carrying light freight, Royal Mail and passengers. The heavy freight and livestock were handled by the company’s wagon trains, and then during the same summer, the first stage-coach passenger service was started by Mr. D. McLeod of Fort Edmonton. McLeod faithfully promised that his weekly stage would make the 200-mile journey in five days, with stops at Peace Hills, Battle River, Red Deer River and other points along the rough and dusty road. In January of 1885 crews of men were sent out from Fort Edmonton to build a bridge across the Battle River at Ponoka, about a half mile downstream from the old ford, which resulted in a change in the original road by four miles to the south. The following year the improvements to the CE trail were underway from the Red Deer River to Calgary.\nThe first official Post Office between Red Deer and Edmonton was at Holbrook on the James Aylwin farm located west of Menaik. At the turn of the century the mail for the Village of Ponoka and districts was brought to the Algar Store at 5020-50th Street for distribution (now the Busted Ladies Lingerie Shop). Later on C.E. Algar would have to rush across the street to punctually meet the train at the Ponoka station and catch the letter bag thrown from the mail car. However, for those customers wishing to receive or send registered mail, it still had to be done from the main Holbrook Post Office. In 1900 Mr. Algar was appointed as the first Postmaster of the Village of Ponoka, a position he held until 1913 when he retired and moved to Edmonton. Mr. George Gordon then took over the Postmaster position for the Town of Ponoka and served until 1940, when he handed the keys to Mr. Charles Healing, his faithful assistant since 1920, who held the post until his retirement in 1955. The first stand-alone modern Ponoka Post Office was a 600 square foot structure at the corner of 51st Avenue, which contained 200 odd boxes, but then due to the ongoing growth of the community, a magnificent 3,600 square foot Post Office was opened in 1951 at the west end of 51st Avenue, which served over 1,000 boxes and had a staff of five. Quite a few years later the present Ponoka Post Office outlet was built on 5030-51st Street, which had less lobby boxes in the service area, but accepted countless mail trucks everyday on a 24-7 basis, from which the massive loads of mail are sorted by the carriers and promptly delivered throughout the town and surrounding districts. Added mail services for the customers have also included outlets in businesses throughout the community.\nSalute to the mail carriers\nAnother very colourful chapter of the longstanding ‘Post Office saga’ in and around Ponoka was the dedicated service and efforts of our rural mail carriers like Paul Delong, Earl Kyler, Howard Lucas and countless others, as well as from the local Dray operators. From the early beginnings of the mail delivery in and around our community there have, and always will be, those hardy and colourful mail carriers who faithfully deliver their much welcome and vital cargo of letters and packages for countless miles on most days of the week on a hectic year round schedule. Beginning in the early 1900s a long list of local dray operators would pick up their mail and supplies at the train station, then carefully packed them into their horse drawn or hand-pushed wooden carts and delivered them around town.\nIn the early years the tons of mail used to be sorted and then delivered to sub-post offices at Chesterwold, Ferrybank, Home Glen, Wood River, Usona and many other districts, but as the system modernized the small outlets closed and thousands of personal boxes were placed along the rural roads, with large multi-boxes later installed in central and neighbourhood locations. The daily mail destined for the Provincial Mental Hospital (Centennial Centre) was picked in the early days from 1912 and on by their ancient school/supplies/passenger bus, and then distributed from their own Post Office in the Heritage building.\nThe first rural mail delivery was handled by the truly very dedicated but always friendly couriers on horse-back or horse and buggy, which were later replaced by the not always so reliable automobile. No matter what the case, each and every one of those many decades of daily mail deliveries may turn out to be a quiet pleasant run or a real adventure, depending of course on the weather, the roads, the seasons and the river. But always in a very long-standing tradition the mail always gets through, and hopefully there will always be a little time for a short visit, a hot cup of coffee, and some fresh baked treats?', 'It’s always fun to get mail from an old friend or someone you weren’t expecting. Since the beginning of the U.S. Postal Service in 1775, millions, if not billions, of letters and packages have been delivered throughout the world. People utilized the postal service to send letters, cards, gifts, and some unusual items from one place to another. From time to time, we hear stories of unusual items being mailed through courier services, but have you heard of people being mailed or a million dollar diamond? Well, here we have collected several such unique items that have made their way through the postal system.\n1. “The Hope Diamond”, a $1 million diamond, was mailed by its owner to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC.\nToday, our prized possessions are sent through courier services that allow us to track the item in real-time. This provides us with some form of comfort, knowing that our possession is safe and that it arrives at the right place. But, what do you do when you want to send a diamond that’s worth a million dollars? One would assume to have a bullet-proof truck with a vault, which is escorted by a motorcade.\nWhen New York jeweler Harry Winston decided to donate the famous Hope Diamond – all 45.52 carats of it – to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C, he chose the USPS. The diamond has an interesting history. Gem dealer Harry Winston acquired the diamond in 1947 when its previous owner passed away. Until 1958, Winston used the piece of jewelry to attract customers and in 1958, he was convinced by his friends and family members to donate the magnificent piece of art to the famous Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.\nWinston, trusted the Post Office and on November 8, 1958, used the registered, First-Class Mail, to send the item from New York City to the Museum of Natural History. The postage cost him $2.44, plus $142.85 for $1 million worth of insurance. Letter Carrier James G. Todd picked up the package on November 10, drove to the Natural History building, took the elevator to the Gem Room and delivered the package to Leonard Carmichael, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. (source)\n2. A business man mailed an entire bank, wall-by-wall through the postal service.\nBelieve it or not, the largest thing to be sent through the mail was a building. Prior to 1913, the postal service was unable to carry items weighing more than four pounds. But, on New Year’s Eve of 1913, a new service called Parcel Post was started, that allowed people to send items that weigh up to 20 lbs. In 1914, the weight limit was increased to 50 lbs. At the same time, William H. Coltharp, a young business man, was looking for ways to save money during the construction of a bank.\nColtharp decided to construct a new bank on the corner of a street in Vernal, Utah, but since he was unable to send the whole building through post, he sent it wall by wall. With the help of the Salt Lake Pressed Brick Company, Coltharp mailed 80,000 bricks by carefully packaging the bricks in separate crates; weighing less than the 50-pound weight limit.\nEach time, Colthard shipped 40 crates a day with the total shipment weighing up to a ton. While his scheme was successful, the U.S. Postal Service wasn’t fond of it. They changed the rules so that a customer is only able to send 200 lbs. of goods per day. The bank built by Coltharp stands to this day. (source)\n3. Henry ‘Box’ Brown, mailed himself to be a free man.\nBorn enslaved in Louisa County, Virginia in 1815, Henry Brown was only 15 when he was sent to Richmond to work in a tobacco factory. Later in life, he found the love of his life, married her and had three children. Although they were deprived of their freedom, Henry and his wife Nancy, were happy that they were together. That all changed in 1848, when his wife, who was pregnant with their fourth child, and his children were shipped off to another plantation in North Carolina. He stood there in tears as he watched his wife, children and more than 300 others, walking away from him in chains.\nHelpless and mourning his loss, Henry decided that it had gone too far and resolved to escape from slavery. Henry was a member of the First African Baptist Church who regularly sang in the choir. He managed to get the help of antislavery activists in the North, who hatched up a plan to ship him out of the state. First, Henry purposely injured his hand so that he could get a day off work. His fellow mates then put him in a crate that was 3 feet long by 2 feet 8 inches deep by 2 feet wide. Henry took with him a small bottle of water and a few biscuits for the journey.\nOn March 23, 1849, the crate labeled “dry goods”, took off from Virginia on a 27 hour long journey via a variety of wagons, railroads, steamboats, ferries, and finally, for added safety, a delivery wagon that brought the box to the Philadelphia. Although there was a “This side up” label, the box was handled roughly; often turned upside down. Finally, the box with Brown inside reached Philadelphia, and was received by William Still, James Miller McKim, Professor C.D. Cleveland, and Lewis Thompson.\nWhen the four anti-slavery activists opened the box, Henry hopped out and said, “How do you do, Gentlemen?” then recited a psalm: “I waited patiently on the Lord and He heard my prayer”. The men then posthumously gave him the name, Henry ‘Box’ Brown, since he was the first man to escape slavery by post. (source)\n4. A cat was mailed through a pneumatic tube during the 1800’s.\nDuring the 1890’s, an intricate system was built to transfer mail across New York City at a fast pace. The pneumatic tubes, which were located 4 to 6 feet below the city’s surface, ejected enormous canisters full of mail at speeds of 35 miles an hour. Men and women who handled the pneumatic tubes were called the “Rocketeers”. According to the Atlantic, during its peek operation, around 95,000 pieces of mail was transferred throughout the city in just one day.\nWhen the pneumatic tube delivery system was launched in 1897, operators wanted to show the speed as well as the safety of the system. For this purpose, they decided to place a live tortoiseshell cat inside one of the tubes and send it down the mailing system. According to postal worker Howard Wallace Connelly who published an autobiography in 1931;\n“How it could live after being ejected at terrific speed from Station P in the Produce Exchange Building, making several turns before reaching Broadway and Park Row, I cannot conceive, but it did. It seemed to be dazed for a minute or two but started to run and was quickly secured and placed in a basket that had been provided for that purpose. A suit of clothes was the third arrival and then came letters, papers, and other ordinary mail matter.”\nAccording to Kenneth Stuart, author of Pneumatic Mail Tubes and Operation of Automatic Railroads, dogs, mice, roosters, guinea pigs, monkeys and a goldfish were also sent down the tube. The system lasted until 1953. (source)\n5. A pet chameleon was sent through mail to Florida.\nPostal service delivers letters, gifts, and sometimes exceptional services. In December 1954, a man named David from Fostoria, Ohio, sent a letter to the postmaster of Orlando, Florida. The letter read:\nI am sending my chameleon because I live in Fostoria, Ohio, and it is to cold for him here. Will you please let him loose.\nP.S. Could you let me know if he arrives there O.K. Than you very much. I am so worried about him.”\nDavid was attached to his pet chameleon but the climate was not suitable for his beloved pet. He sent the letter to the postmaster, along with the chameleon. On December 7, David received the following note from Orlando’s postmaster: “Dear David, I received your chameleon yesterday and he was immediately released on the post office grounds. Best wishes for a merry Christmas!” (source)\n6. Helium-filled balloon, fish, and other bizarre items were mailed to test the limits of postal service.\nThere are people who love to test the limits of anything and everything. In 2000, a team of social scientists from the science-humor magazine Improbable Research, decided to test the postal service. Their aim was to see how many bizarre items they can ship and what all they can ship. For this, the team included items from six categories: valuable items, sentimental items, unwieldy items, pointless items, suspicious items, and disgusting items.\nFirst, an expensive pair of tennis shoes bound by duct tape was mailed as part of the valuable items. The shoes arrived at its intended destination in seven days. For the sentimental value category, the team sent a molar through the mail. It took 14 days but the item reached its destination, along with a note that read: “Please be advised that such items may not be transported through the mail, but we assumed this to be of sentimental value, and made an exception in your case.”\nFor the “unwieldy items” category, they sent a ski through the mail; which was delivered 11 days later. For the “Pointless items” category, they sent a coconut, which also found its way back home in 10 days. When it came to the “suspicious items” category, the team sent a street sign, which is something that is not allowed, but the sign made its way back home in 9 days.\nFinally, for the “disgusting” category, they sent fish, seaweed and rancid cheese. To their surprise, all the items were delivered within 9 days, along with a warning that said, they would be fined for mail service abuse if they carried on with their experiments. (source)\n7. “Human letters” were sent through the mail where a mail man would deliver a person who has a message for them. Suffragettes often used them to send messages.\nA suffragette was a woman who wanted the right to vote through organized protest. During the 20th century, women protested for equal rights and for the ability to cast votes. They tried their best to get publicity and national attention. In 1909, two suffragettes found a loophole in the postal service. “Human letters” were allowed to travel through the mail system and deliver a message.\nMiss Solomon and Miss McLellan wanted to send their message to the prime minister and so, registered themselves as “human letters” to his address. They walked into the postal department, paid the delivery fees and were directed towards the man who was intended to deliver telegrams. One of them held a poster about an upcoming demonstration while the other had the message. Since they were “human letters”, the delivery man had no other choice but to deliver them and receive an acknowledgement.\nAlthough the plan was perfectly carried out, the prime minister’s butler stopped them at the entrance. They were denied entry and were returned to the post office. (source)\n8. Pieces of the Titanic.\nFor the “Titanic: The Artifact Exhibition”, over 90 tons of the famed unsinkable ship were sent via mail from Milan, Italy, all the way to Atlanta, Georgia. The exhibit was showcasing bits and pieces of the Titanic wreckage in a public museum, often traveling all over the world to do so. One of the pieces of the wreckage shipped via mail was a 3,000 pound piece of the ship’s hull, along with Leonardo DiCaprio’s resume that was found washed ashore.\nEach recovery effort for the Titanic wreckage costs between $1 million and $3 million. Until today, the recovery crew has managed to recover 5,000 objects, many of which are too fragile to be transported. (source)\n9. A $350,000 drone was accidentally mailed to a Massachusetts college student.\nIn 2014, a Massachusetts college student received a package labelled to him by the postal service. According to the anonymous redditor, the box was addressed to him and had apparently been sitting in storage for a while.\n“They told me that it was one of the undelivered packages in their office, and asked if I’ve ever had an undelivered package. I said no, but he insisted that it was mine, and said that it was up to me if I want to keep it or not,” he wrote. “Nothing on the outside of the crate said it was government property. I had ordered a weightlifting bench (which I received) and this came with it. Both boxes had labels with my name and address. Though an odd box, I genuinely thought it was parts for the bench I ordered, since I wasn’t expecting a drone.”\nThe package was in fact mailed from MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, where NOAA has an operations center. NOAA uses these drones to study the ocean as well as to monitor hurricanes and other anomalies within nature. When the package was opened, a card in the package read, “USA Federal Property Return to: NOAA Aircraft Operations Center”.\nAfter finding a $350,000 drone inside, the redditor contacted NOAA and returned the package safely. According to NOAA, the drone is capable of flying for more than two hours at a time and has a range of 8 miles. No one knows who is responsible for the error but thankfully, the expensive piece of equipment reached its final destination. (source)\n10. May Pierstorff was mailed to visit her grandmother because the cost of a train ticket was too high.\nThroughout history, people have tried to mail strange things. Certainly none was more surprising than the use of the service to “mail” people. The first case was of Mr. and Mrs. Jesse Beauge from Ohio. When the couple found out that the postal service allowed things to be transported as long as they are under 10 lbs, they mailed their 5 kg (10 lbs) baby to his grandmother’s house at a cost of 15 cents. The couple even had insurance on him for $50.\nWhen the postal service changed the weight limit to 50 lbs, another couple had the same idea. May Pierstorff was a few months shy of being six, and was below the 50 lbs weight limit. On February 19, 1914, the 48 1/2 pound package was “mailed” from Grangeville to Lewiston, Idaho. May’s parents wanted her to visit her grandmother but were reluctant to pay the train fare. Since the postal service had no provisions in the parcel post regulations about sending a person, they stamped her with a 53 cents postage and mailed her.\nMay traveled the entire distance to Lewiston in the train’s mail compartment and was delivered to her grandmother’s home by the mail clerk on duty, Leonard Mochel. When other parents saw this as an opportunity and started utilizing the service, the postmaster general put an end to the service.

2	squash noodles recipe nutritional benefits	Squash noodles offer significant nutritional benefits, with just 42 calories per cup compared to regular pasta's 221 calories. They provide vitamin A, potassium, calcium, and are fat-free. To prepare them, you can make a light pasta sauce using roma tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, basil, and garlic. The squash can be spiralized or cut into ribbons with a vegetable peeler, then mixed with the sauce. Additional ingredients like sautéed fennel and yellow plum tomatoes can be added for extra flavor.	['8 substitutions for healthier holiday cooking\nEnjoy healthier versions of your favourite holiday dishes by making these sneaky ingredient switches\nThe holidays wouldn’t be the same without all your favourite treats-but why consume the extra fat and calories in the traditional versions when there are ways to make them healthy without even noticing?\nWe talked to Leslie Beck, Toronto-based dietitian and author of Leslie Beck’s Healthy Kitchen, about our favourite healthy substitutions, and what makes them a better choice.\nSpaghetti squash for pasta\nThe flesh of spaghetti squash, as the name implies, separates into thin strands when it’s cooked, making it the perfect spaghetti substitute. Cover this sweet squash with any sauce for a delicious take on traditional pasta-not only is it tasty, it’s much healthier.\n“Spaghetti squash is much lower in calories than pasta, and you get some vegetables in there as well. One cup is just 42 calories and 10 grams of carbs. Since it’s a vegetable, you’re getting vitamins and minerals. It’s a source of vitamin A, potassium and calcium and fibre. And it’s fat free.”\nIf you choose white pasta instead, not only is it more calories, it also doesn’t have the same vitamin content. “One cup of regular white pasta is 221 calories, so that’s a big difference,” says Beck. “White pasta has less than half of the potassium, no vitamin A, no beta-carotene, and only one third of the calcium.”\nOats for breadcrumbs and flour\nOats are great for more than just breakfast. Because of their texture, they work well in baking to replace half the flour, and they’re perfect for topping dishes that usually call for breadcrumbs.\n“Most breadcrumbs are refined, whereas oats are a whole grain, and give you more fibre, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants,” says Beck.\nCoconut cream for heavy cream\nCoconut milk isn’t just for curries. If you like the subtle taste of coconut, you can also use it to substitute heavy cream in baking and cooking. It also has a surprising secret when it’s cooled. If you put a can of coconut milk in the fridge overnight, the thickest, creamiest part of the milk will rise to the top of the can. Without shaking the can, remove the lid, scoop out the thick layer with a spoon, and whip it with some maple syrup and vanilla-it makes the perfect sweet substitute for whipped cream.\n“Coconut milk is a big source of fat, like heavy cream, but unlike heavy cream, the saturated fat in coconut milk seems to raise HDL (good cholesterol) versus bad cholesterol,” says Beck.\nFlaxseed for eggs\nEggs can provide the right consistency to bind baked goods-but they’re not the only thing that can. Ground flaxseed, when combined with water, turns gel-like and provides the perfect replacement for eggs. For every egg you replace, combine 1 tbsp of flax with 3 tbsps of water.\n“You’re cutting out the saturated fat and cholesterol, plus you’re adding soluble fibre to your dish, as well as a phytochemical called lignin that is thought to help reduce the risk of breast cancer,” says Beck. “And you’re getting omega 3 fatty acids.”\nNot only that, but eggs have more fat and cholesterol than flaxseed. “If you’re having an egg instead, you’re getting 75 calories, 5 grams of saturated fat and 190 mg of cholesterol,” says Beck.\nMashed banana, applesauce or avocado for butter or oil\nNot only does banana add a natural sweetness to baked goods, it’s also moist, so it can replace oil or butter.\n“Banana has no fat,” says Beck. And if you use it in place of butter or oil, you’ll “cut calories and fat and add potassium.”\nDon’t love the idea of banana? You can also use avocado.\n“Avocado is a healthy source of fat. It’s mostly monounsaturated fat-the same type found in olive oil,” says Beck. What makes it different than oil is the fact that it’s also a fruit, which means it provides the “nutrients that come in whole foods,” according to Beck. “You’ll also get some phytochemicals, vitamins and minerals that you don’t get in processed oil.”\nAnother simple substitution is applesauce, which can help provide the right consistency in baked goods and, according to Beck, it also cuts calories and fat.\nWhole grain spelt flour for white flour\nThere are lots of different types of flours that can be used in baking-spelt, rice, quinoa and many more. But the easiest replacement you can make to boost nutrients without having to alter the rest of a recipe is trading white flour for spelt.\nNot only does it have “more fibre and more antioxidants,” according to Beck, it’s also got “less gluten in it than durum (standard) wheat.”\nThe bonus? People with sensitive tummies at holiday parties will be able to more easily digest your delicious baked goods.\n“Some people can tolerate it better if they’re sensitive to wheat,” says Beck.\nAgave nectar for sugar\nIf you want sweet baked goods-without the sugar crash-replace each cup of sugar with 2/3 of a cup of agave nectar in your favourite recipes.\n“Agave nectar has a very low glycemic index, so it doesn’t cause spikes in your blood sugar like white sugar does,” says Beck.\nWhy is that important?\nBecause you don’t want to spend your night craving sugar and feeling tired.\n“High glycemic foods result in an outpouring of insulin into your blood, which brings down your blood sugar sooner-meaning you’ll be hungry sooner,” says Beck. “With agave nectar or any other low glycemic food, it causes blood sugar to rise gradually, so your energy level stays up longer, and you don’t have cravings.”\nNuts for croutons and breadcrumbs\nCroutons add a nice crunch to salads, and breadcrumbs add a crispy topping to any dish-but there’s a healthier way to add crunch and crisp to your cooking: Nuts.\nNuts provide “a source of healthy fats, protein, vitamin E, other vitamins and minerals,” says Beck, “Plus they helps maintain healthy blood pressure and healthy blood cholesterol.”', 'Fresh yellow squash noodles with a light pasta sauce made with roma tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, basil, and garlic. Hello, summer!\nI know it is summer time when fresh basil and yellow squash make their appearance at the farmers market. The problem I often run into whenever I buy fresh basil is their shelf life. Basil wilts, grows black spots, and molds so quickly that I find myself scrambling to use them before they go bad.\nOver the past few months, I have experimented with this method of storing fresh basil. The key is to treat fresh basil like flowers. Take a fresh bunch of basil, trim the ends and put it in a jar filled with water. Leave the jar of basil in room temperature with a plastic bag loosely covering the entire jar. In theory, this method should keep basil fresh for 1 to 2 weeks.\nWhen I first tried this storage method, I was disappointed to find mold growing within a few days. But in a “well, duh” moment, I realized that I should change the water as I would with flowers. After this minor tweak, the basil has been keeping fresh for a little longer, though its green vibrance will fade.\nI made this fresh yellow squash noodle dish to make sure that I use the basil at its peak. I added some sautéed fennel and yellow plum tomatoes for additional flavor. I loved that this dish was bursting with flavor yet light at the same time.\nFresh yellow squash noodles with a light pasta sauce made with roma tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, basil, and garlic. Makes 2-3 Servings.\n10 minPrep Time\n15 minCook Time\n25 minTotal Time\n1 and 1/2 TBS olive oil\n5 medium roma tomatoes, halved and seeded\n4 cloves garlic, peeled\n3 sun-dried tomatoes (I used the kind that is not packed in oil)\n1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, loosely packed\npinch of sea salt\n3 large yellow squash\n2/3 cup yellow plum tomatoes (optional)\nSautéed Fennel (Optional)\n1 fennel bulb, thinly sliced\n1 TBS olive oil\n1 TBS fresh dill, chopped\npinch of sea salt\nHeat 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil in a small sauté pan over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add the garlic and tomatoes cut side down. Let the tomatoes cook for 3 minutes before turning them over. Cook for another 2-3 minutes and then turn off the heat.\nIn a food processor or blender, mix the sautéed tomatoes, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, basil, and salt until smooth.\nCut off both ends of each of the yellow squash. Spiralize the squash with Blade C, and chop the noodles several times so that they are easier to eat. Be sure to slice the part of the squash that is not spiralized and mix them with the noodles. NOTE: If you do not own a spiralizer, use a vegetable peeler to create yellow squash ribbons.\nIf you are adding fennel to this dish, heat a tablespoon of oil in a small sauté pan over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add the fennel and sauté them for about 4-5 minutes or until they turn translucent. Season with some fresh dill and salt.\nIn a large bowl, mix the noodles and sauce together. Serve with the fennel and plum tomatoes.\nRefrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container.\nRecipe Type: gluten-free, vegan, main dishes, sides']	['<urn:uuid:a510b243-8f3f-4e65-8f20-399e7d50b099>', '<urn:uuid:41c9d014-c9d0-4a74-b4ba-326f47c1bf70>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	5	78	1563
3	I'm designing support systems for multilingual education and want to understand: what are the key considerations for language policy implementation in schools, and what potential pitfalls should we watch out for in terms of role boundaries?	In language policy implementation, several critical factors must be considered alongside potential role boundary issues. For language policy, the focus should be on developing additive and heteroglossic approaches to bilingualism that can enrich classroom learning and teaching. Programs need to consider both academic content and socialization aspects, with careful attention to indigenous and minority language needs. The major pitfall to avoid is role confusion and boundary issues among educational support staff. Particularly in interpreted settings, there must be clear separation between interpretation and tutoring roles - combining them creates problematic 'oxymorons' like 'qualified tutor' or 'interpreter/assistant' that undermine educational goals. When role boundaries blur, it can lead to power struggles, codependency, and authority ambiguity. Teachers may incorrectly expect interpreters to handle curriculum development, student evaluation, and discipline. The ideal implementation maintains clear professional boundaries while supporting both content and language development through appropriate channels.	"['Course outline_ENG717_Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL)\nTitle: Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL)\nCourse code: ENG717\nNo. of credits: 3 credits\n1. COURSE OVERVIEW\nThis course introduces and then critically considers theories, policies and practices relevant to bilingual and content-based programs globally and in Vietnam. In particular, it builds on students’ understandings of the processes of language acquisition by focusing on the integration of language and content in the English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context. The course explores various philosophical standpoints, theoretical perspectives, program options, and research issues that have shaped the field of bilingual education in the last decade, with particular emphasis on content and language integreated learning (CLIL) and its sociolinguistic, psycholinguistic, political and educational aspects. Through the exploration of connections between research and pedagogy, including recent bilingual instructional strategies such as translanguaging, students examine the development and maintenance of bilingualism and biliteracy in formal learning environments. In addition, key policies and documents related to CLIL are investigated with a focus on the pedagogical implications of additional language literacies and first language development.\n2.

STUDENT WORKLOAD\n- Directed study: 60 periods\n- Independent Study: 120 periods', 'Empowering the Young Deaf Communityby Amy Frasu, MA, CI/CT, NIC Advanced, BEI Advanced Empowering the Young Deaf Community (pdf version)\nAs an interpreter, I find that educating hearing consumers about the interpreter\'s role is one of the most challenging parts of our profession. Regardless of skill level or setting, it is difficult to interpret for a person that lacks the knowledge necessary to use interpreting services. The consumer\'s ideas about interpreting are solely based on my actions, words, and any precedents I set for the future. Educating the hearing consumer is a key element of the interpreter\'s daily routine… but what about the deaf consumer? Who teaches deaf people how to use an interpreter?\nJust as hearing people learn the rules and etiquette of interpreted situations, deaf people learn to use interpreters through experience. The major difference being that these experiences tend to happen at a young age. Schools that use interpreters carry a tremendous responsibility for shaping the ideas of deaf consumers and influencing the young Deaf Community - to empower or to oppress.\nInterpreters are professionals responsible for unbiased facilitation of communication; however there is no question that the interpreter\'s presence effects every interpreted situation. In a school setting, there are two categories of experiences - academics and socialization; the interpreting process is a professional relationship superimposed on top of these experiences.\nBecause the mainstreaming/inclusion approach is still considered the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE) by most public school administrators, placing an interpreter in the classroom seems to be a reasonable accommodation. On paper it appears that this will be a successful formula:eaf student + interpreter + regular education teacher + hearing students = LRE, $, and success\nUnfortunately, the placement of a deaf student in a mainstream classroom is often done with little proactive thought. Therefore, in reality the formula tends to look more like this:\ndeaf student + inexperience with an interpreter & language delay + unskilled signer + ""helper"" approach + regular education teacher + low expectations & ignorance + hearing students + pity & fear = negative outcomes (blamed on the deaf student\'s ""disability"")\nIn order to change this scenario to a more positive and empowering learning environment for the deaf student, it is necessary to analyze the purpose of the educational interpreter - to facilitate communication through use of sign language, spoken English, cultural mediation, and knowledge about accessibility. Because of the many complex factors involved in this process, it is sometimes easier to consider non-examples of interpreting (what interpreters should not do) as a guide.\nRole Conflicts - ""Tutor"" is a Four-Letter Word\nA role conflict occurs when an interpreter acts beyond ethical boundaries, therefore sending mixed signals about the role of the interpreter. Tutoring is a classic example of role conflict in a classroom setting. If an interpreter gives the student her views about how to solve a math problem, the meaning of a vocabulary word, or which topics to read for a homework assignment, this action immediately causes a breakdown in communication between the deaf student and his teacher and peers. Over time, this pattern may lead to power struggles, codependency, authority ambiguity, and many other difficulties. It may also cause role confusion from the teacher\'s perspective, creating expectations for the interpreter to assume additional responsibilities (e.g. supervision of students, curriculum development, evaluation of progress, and discipline.)\nSuspension of Disbelief\nSimilar to an actor, an interpreter must ""become"" several characters - the teacher, the friend, the voice on the intercom, the principal, the boy, the girl, and countless others. Trust is an integral part of this process. If the interpreter acts as a disciplinarian in the student\'s life, it would be difficult for the student to feel relaxed when the interpreter is present. The student may view the interpreter as an authority figure at inappropriate times, therefore causing mistrust and discomfort.\nMainstreaming - One Size Does Not Fit All\nNot all deaf students are good candidates for using an interpreter to gather information. The student must have sufficient language, memory, and social skills to understand who is speaking, how to take turns in a conversation, and integration of background knowledge with new information.\nA deaf student that is unsuccessful in a regular education classroom may need to be moved to a different placement where interpreters are not necessary for communication, such as a school for the deaf. Another arrangement may be for a teacher of the deaf to reinforce lessons with the student and provide support to the classroom teacher.\nA deaf student with multiple disabilities and/or severe emotional problems may need additional accommodations in order to learn. In this type of situation, it may be necessary to use an interpreter and an assistant or teacher in order to make accommodations for the student\'s individual needs. Interpreters are not companions and should not be expected to mentor a student under any circumstances.\nThe Oxymorons of InterpretingAn oxymoron is the use of two words together that contradict each other, creating a nonsensical expression. Oxymorons in the field of educational interpreting include:\n""qualified tutor"" -\nThis label is incompatible, regardless of the interpreter\'s credentials. Although most interpreters are not trained to teach, qualifications to instruct are irrelevant. The interpreter\'s priority should be focused on student-to-teacher or student-to-peer communication.\n""teacher-directed tutor"" -\nOften the interpreter is placed with the student and expected to plan, instruct, and evaluate the student\'s learning under direction of the teacher. This places the interpreter in a situation that does not involve interpreting and is therefore not appropriate. Although the activities may seem simple to carry out, they undermine the basic goal of education - for the deaf student to interact with her teacher and peers, to succeed academically and socially, and to become a contributing member of society. Relying on an interpreter as an instructor does not support this goal.\n""interpreter/assistant"" or ""interpreter/tutor"" -\nThese are two distinct occupations and should not be combined. There should be a clear difference between responsibilities of the interpreter and duties of the assistant.The following charts outline two situations - a classroom with an Interpreter/Tutor and a classroom with a Professional Interpreter. The charts compare the perspectives of each individual affected.\nClassroom with an Interpreter/TutorStudent:\n- unable to work alone or make decisions\n- feels unintelligent compared to hearing students\n- does not take responsibility for his education\n- views the teacher as a less valuable resource because the teacher cannot sign\n- presents and clarifies content as a second-hand source\n- creates role conflicts\n- hinders communication by obstructing interaction between the deaf student and hearing people in the school\nN/ATeacher (Mainstream Classroom):\n- left out of process\n- emphasis is on communication (lack of sign language fluency) rather than on teaching skills\n- the teacher/student relationship is weak\n- sees student as an exception to rules rather than as a part of the class\n- views the interpreter as an assistant that follows the deaf student\n- finds out about the mainstream situation by asking the interpreter to disclose confidential information\n- relies on the interpreter to assess the student\'s needs\n- views multiple roles as cost-effective\n- complications are overlooked due to lack of experience\nClassroom with a Professional InterpreterStudent:\n- independent thinker\n- accepts successes and failures as his own\n- relationships with adults and peers are strengthened through interaction\n- forms opinions about the teacher based on personality (instead of sign language abilities)\n- interprets (facilitates communication)\n- fosters autonomy by interpreting neutrally\n- does not offer opinions or advice\n- educates about visual accessibility (closed captioning, line of sight, etc.)\n- companion/mentor for students with multiple disabilities\n- provides aid for physical needs\n- tutors (skill drills, etc.)\n- assist teachers with clerical work\n- valued as a professional educator\n- views deaf student as a capable member of the class\n- evaluation of the student\'s progress is based on experiences in class and observation of the student\'s work (instead of the interpreter\'s untrained opinions)\n- views the interpreter as a skilled professional that interprets for everyone in the classroom\n- communicates with staff members without using the interpreter as an informant\n- expert about literacy issues, social inclusion, accessibility, accommodations, and adaptation of the regular curriculum\n- part of comprehensive team that meets the student\'s needs\n- informed and comfortable with interpreting issues\nDeaf Community Stakeholders\nDeaf adults, teachers of the deaf, sign language interpreters, parents of deaf children, and deaf children themselves could be considered ""stakeholders"" in the future of the Deaf Community. Each stakeholder may support a different philosophy or methodology, but ultimately each person is invested in seeing deaf students lead successful lives. These people would most likely agree that fostering independence in deaf students is a sensible and necessary component of deaf education.\nIn a survey of 30 Deaf Community stakeholders, 77% of the participants stated that deaf students should become assertive about their interpreting needs and preferences at a very young age. The remaining 23% also advocated that deaf students should be assertive, but not until at least 14 years of age. This group of people unanimously deemed assertiveness a positive quality for deaf students.\nThe same survey yielded a divided perspective about whether or not interpreters should tutor deaf students. When asked, ""Is tutoring by the interpreter an appropriate accommodation for deaf students in grades K-12?"" the answers were: 30% = yes, 23% = yes (with specific conditions), 13% = no (under certain circumstances), 30% = no, and 3% = undecided.\n- Deaf Person - 6\n- Deaf Person/Teacher - 1\n- Interpreter - 10\n- Teacher of the Deaf - 3\n- Interpreter/Teacher of the Deaf - 1\n- Parent of a deaf child - 1\n- Interpreter/Teacher of the Deaf/Parent - 1\n- Interpreter Educator - 2\n- Student (Interpreter Training Program) - 2\n- Other - 2\nDo you think it is beneficial for deaf students to become assertive about their interpreting needs and preferences?\nYes = 77%\nConditional Yes = 23%\nConditional No = 0%\nNo = 0%\nUndecided = 0%\nYes = 30%\nConditional Yes = 23%\nConditional No = 13%\nNo = 30%\nUndecided = 3%\nAdvocates in favor of tutoring stated many opinions:\nDeaf students need support in their studies. The interpreter knows the student\'s strengths and weaknesses. If the interpreter is qualified to tutor, it is a wonderful advantage for the deaf student to reinforce what is learned in the classroom. The location of tutoring should be considered carefully because it might be embarrassing for the student to be singled out during class. Overall, tutoring is a crucial component of educational interpreting\nOpponents of interpreters as tutors had many statements about this issue as well:\nWhy would someone waste a valuable resource like a trained teacher and use an interpreter to tutor instead? Most interpreters have no training or expertise in instruction. The interpreter should not try to re-teach material that was deleted or ambiguous during class due to lack of interpreting skills. Using an interpreter as a tutor does not prepare the student for life as an adult. Tutoring could cause confusion for everyone involved. The teacher needs to evaluate what the student knows and does not know. The interpreter should interpret, period.\nThe Answer is Autonomy\nAlthough professionals are unable to come to a clear consensus about the educational interpreter\'s role, it is apparent that deaf students need more than tutoring services to help them lead independent lives. Hearing students are given the opportunity to learn from a variety of people, experiences, and routines. Deaf students of all ages deserve the same freedoms and responsibilities that come with self-determination.\nInterpreting services are listed on most IEPs in reference to hours, cost, and the school district\'s language philosophy. IEPs have goals for math, English, behavior, and other areas. What about the skills the student will need to become an assertive and knowledgeable consumer? IEP goals should address interpreting consumer skills throughout all grade levels, but this area of education is often overlooked. Young deaf students are sent into class, expected to look only to the interpreter for guidance.\nDependence on the interpreter causes the student to share ownership of learning, therefore successes and failures are never truly the student\'s own achievements. Given a skilled and ethical interpreter in an appropriate classroom placement, any deaf student can perform independently. Beginning as early as kindergarten, a deaf student can choose to follow class rules and procedures, accept accountability for all assignments, participate in academic and social situations, pay attention to key information during instruction, setup an appropriate line-of-sight, and request content clarification without interference from the interpreter.\nAs the student gets older, she can move higher through levels of autonomy. By middle school or high school, a deaf student should be able to state preferences about a specific interpreting mode and style, provide detailed feedback about the interpreter\'s performance, actively participate in interpreter scheduling (e.g. cancellations, special appointments) request accommodations in the classroom (e.g. closed captioned videos, notetaking, adequate lighting), and accurately explain the role of the interpreter. The IEP goals should guide the student from simple to complex tasks of independent thinking.\nActive learning happens through experiences, successes/mistakes, and adjustments. With the interpreter present to facilitate communication, not to interfere, the deaf student can learn how to control her behavior in the world around her - in kindergarten and beyond.\nSign Language Interpreting is a very new field compared to most professions. 100 years ago, teachers were not allowed to get married or dye their hair. They were not required to have a college degree. 50 years ago no one knew about Deaf Culture, ASL, RID, ADA, or PL-94-142. I look forward to seeing the changes in interpreting over the next several decades. More than anything, I look forward to today\'s deaf youth becoming a strong and thriving Deaf Community.\nCitation of this Document:Frasu, Amy.

5	salt marsh plants animals northeast united states species examples	Salt marshes of the northeast United States are home to many species including Clapper Rail birds, Grass Shrimp invertebrates, Marsh Rabbits mammals, and Diamondback Terrapin reptiles. There is abundant grass, herbs, and low shrubs in these environments	['Table of Contents\nSalt marsh refers to a coastal ecosystem in the upper coastal intertidal zone between open salt water and land whose tides experience floods on a regular basis. The mean elevation of the salt surfaces has to build up to keep in pace with the continuous increase in sea level and developments of salt marsh organic composition. If the rates of sedimentation in salt marsh do not surpass the actual loss in elevation due to the steady increase in the sea level and salt marsh substance, it will drown. When drowning occurs, the surface of the marsh area becomes slightly tidal which can cause numerous changes on the habitat. Such changes include conversion of vegetated salt marsh which tends to increase the flat mud.\nSalt marshes, particularly in Northeast parts of the United States, serve as a critical habitat for many species of both plants and animals. The marshes perform a variety of ecologically vital chemical functions including inorganic and organic waste retention. They also, lead to removal and transformation of global carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen biogeochemical cycling. They cause sediment entrapment along with buffering of upland surface from wave and storm impacts, erosion, and coastal flooding.\nSouth Carolina features more salt marsh acreage as compared to any other coastline state in the United States of America. These salt marshes are due to a high rate of the fall and rise of tides which, cause bold changes in levels of salinity, water depth, and temperature. Frequency, salinity and extent of flooding influence the types of animals and plants found there.\nSalt marshes form an integral part of coastal estuaries along the Maine state. The marshes are lying low and are open plains with abundant grasses. They are colorful bands, which have a relationship with tidal pools and creeks. They result from the relationship among different varieties of salt marsh plants, which proliferate in response to a certain mode of tidal ups and downs. The salt marshes flourish depending on its ability to link to the sea. Various plants form the basis of the exceptionally productive salt marsh ecosystem. The marshes are always in small and large patches along the Maine’s tidal coastlines.\nSalt marshes of Maine have regional character. Along the southwest coastline, large marshes form meadows protected by barrier beaches, which are similar to salt marshes in Connecticut and Massachusetts. They can be found along the landward openings of protected coves in the further east especially along the upper vicinity of tidal rivers.\nA salt marsh refers to muddy seashores with rich vegetation that they feature. It is an area that presents in itself a transitional layer between salty water and land. The salt marshes develop on coasts, estuaries, and bays, where tidal rises and falls lead to gentle and light erosion. Such sheltered conditions lead to the formation of fine particles materials like clays, silts, and mud which begin binding together. Particles eventually transform from suspended state and start to deposit. These processes occur continuously, implying that the length of the mud enlarges with time and, therefore, the surface is exposed to out of the water condition over longer periods.\nThe above process necessitates the seeds of plants, which are carried out by water or wind, to germinate while attaching their roots solid into the ground. The impact of these first plants in terms of the developing salt marsh affects its physical condition. Plants help in binding together mud and oxygen transmission. They also trap more sediment; their decomposition over winter supplements nutrients, organic matter, and minerals to the composition of muddy soil.\nSalt marshes of the northeast of the United States of America are home to extremely many plants and animals. Birds like Clapper Rail are present in such areas. Invertebrates like Grass Shrimp, Mammals like Marsh Rabbits, and Reptiles like Diamondback Terrapin inhabit the salt marshes. The marshes are extremely productive environments. There is abundant grass, herbs, and low shrubs which dominate the view. The importance of shat marsh to the animals, which inhabit the area, is that some animals like birds, crabs, snails, and fish can take shelter among the plants and in shallow water. Most of the species have evolved traits that enable them to tolerate salt water. Most marshes have sedge that provides food for animals.\nSalt waters are necessary because they provide significant breeding and feeding grounds for many animals and act as nurseries for fish such as Pacific Salmon. Microorganisms break down marshes from plants; tidal currents take them offshore. These materials are helpful to the floating plankton that provides food for fish and marine mammals. The wildlife found in the salt marine provides valuable tourism, education, recreation, and research opportunities for scholars.\nBenefit from Our Service: Save 25% Along with the first order offer - 15% discount, you save extra 10% since we provide 300 words/page instead of 275 words/page\nAnimals like rodents, birds, and fish live in the salt marshes. Mammals and other categories of animals inhabit the marshes. These animals have developed special features that help them live in a salty environment.\nThe importance of salt marshes from Carolina up to Maine is identical in many forms. Salt marshes protect against waves and sea level rise. This is because salt marshes are able to expand and keep pace with the increasing ocean level since they trap nutrients and sediment, which enable them to form peat.\nSalt marshes provide a nursery area for fish, crustaceans, and insects. There is a lot of food of which fish and insects feed, and the area protects them from predators, thus enabling them to proliferate. The salt marshes have vegetation that bacteria consume. The decaying plants and microbes provide food for insects, fish and mussels. The other importance is that salt marshes lead to spatial migration of plant community zones; this depends on the relative sea level rise rate, the acceleration rate as specific to zone and location, and the availability of land at a suitable base elevation. Migration of animals like birds is highly common in salt marshes; they migrate to such places every autumn and spring.\nThe observations from the experiments establish that the level of carbon monoxide produced by Toyota which has 6 cylinders is the highest. This is as a result of the many numbers of cylinders and the age of the vehicle. Presence of carbon monoxide in larger quantity implies a low rate of internal combustion. Volkswagen produced in 2013 produce the highest amount of carbon dioxide; this is because its engine allows complete combustion since the car is still new and powerful. Nissan Quest of 2000 produces the largest amount of Nitrogen. This is a result of incomplete combustion of gasoline. The age of the car has a relationship to the amount of carbon dioxide produced. Cars made between 2000 and 2008 record 0.7% level of emission. Vehicles made in 2000 have the same level of carbon monoxide emission. Number of cylinders and fuel do not a play part in determining the amount of emissions.\n- Source of carbon monoxide\nCarbon monoxide results from incomplete combustion, which takes place; this is due to partial oxidization of fuel to carbon dioxide.\n- Carbon dioxide\nCarbon dioxide is a product of perfect combustion in the internal engine of a car. Fuel burns to result into the water and carbon dioxide.\n- Nitrogen dioxide\nIt results from the reaction between nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the air due to increase in pressure and temperature in an engine of a car.\nGasoline is the fuel that burns in the internal engine of a car. It gets into the tailpipe through fuel evaporation thus sneaking into the environment. Evaporative emission can occur due to diurnal where, gasoline evaporation intensifies as the temperature increases during the day, heating the fuel tank which emits gasoline vapors.\n- Sulfur Dioxide\nIt results from incomplete combustion in the internal engine of a car. It has an adverse effect on the environment.\nBook The Best Top Expert at our service\nYour order will be assigned to the most experienced writer in the relevant discipline.

When somebody inhales carbon monoxide, it reacts with oxygen carrying hemoglobin of the blood. This reaction is unsuitable in human bodies.\nEarly symptoms of carbon monoxide include fatigue, headaches, and nausea. Symptoms like physical weakness and flu are a result of exposure to carbon monoxide.\nHealth dangers of nitrogen dioxide gas include throat, eye, and nose irritation. Gas may cause respiratory and lung infections in children. It may lead to increase in bronchial reactivity in asthmatic individuals.

6	Our current work processes seem inefficient and I want to understand them better. What are the benefits of using visual methods to map out and improve our work processes?	Using visual methods to map work processes offers several important benefits. First, it helps make complex processes more transparent and easier to understand by presenting them visually rather than in text documents. Visual tools like swim lane diagrams and information radiators help identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and duplicate efforts that might be hidden in traditional text-based procedures. They also improve communication between team members by showing how different parts of the process connect. When information is constantly visible, people work more efficiently because they don't waste time searching for information, and the information stays more accurate because people are continuously reminded of it. These visual methods also make it easier to spot areas for improvement and analyze the potential impact of any changes to the process.	['What is Visualisation of Work?\nThis practice involves radiating and visually representing all aspects of work. Information that is useful to team members, stakeholders and users is physically presented on walls, windows, doors and other flat surfaces and positioned in the line of sight of those people who will get value from consuming the information.\nThe “Information Radiator” is an artefact that is used to physically provide information to one or more people.\nThe activity of “Walking the Walls” is where someone interested in the work can walk around the physical space the associated team(s) are working from and get all the information they need from inspecting artefacts on the wall and from the resulting conversations.\nWhy Visualise work?\nVisualising work helps facilitate a transparent and open way of working. It helps avoid hiding information about status, progress, direction, challenges and opportunities related to a product. Traditionally such information is held in files on shared drives (for example, spreadsheets of project plans, powerpoint slides, word documents, etc.) which has the challenge of not being accessible or known about and, if found, not being up-to-date.\nWhere important information is constantly accessible and visible to people, both speed and accuracy of their work can improve with reduced wastage from having to search for information. It is also more likely that the information is accurate because people are continuously being reminded of it.\nPractices we use that result in information radiators which we use to visualise work include:\n- Impact Mapping\n- Event Storming\n- Value Stream Mapping and Metric Based Process Mapping\n- Target Outcomes\n- Social Contact\n- User Story Mapping\n- Product Backlogs\n- Sprint Boards\n- Burndown and Burnup Charts\n- Build Monitors\n- CI/CD monitors\n- Realtime Retrospective\n- Team Sentiment\nWho do you need?\n- A facilitator (such as a Scrum Master) to drive transparent ways of working.\n- The full team who are responsible for delivering the work visualised.\n- Interested stakeholders to consume information and feed back on it.\n- 5-10 minutes to produce each information radiator and start it radiating.\n- Ad hoc updates performed on an ongoing basis with the facilitator driving the continuous consumption of and feedback from the information being presented.\n- Facilitator - Medium\n- Participants - Easy\nHow does it fit?\n- Tyipcally done in the Culture and Collaboration are of the Foundation of the Open Practice Library\nFacilitation Materials Needed\n- Flip chart paper\n- Magic Whiteboard charts\n- Writable walls\n- Flip chart and white board pens\n- Stickie notes (all shapes, sizes and colors)\n- Sharpie pens\n- Large monitor / TV screens\n- Small computers to radiate dashboards (e.g. CI/CD monitors)\n- Consider the positioning of all information radiators and who will have line of sight\n- Consider use of color coding across different information radiators (for example, same color stickies to represent features)\n- Allow sufficient time to produce high quality information radiators that will inspire and drive interest\n- Introduce the information radiator to all those who will use it (either in contributing to it and/or consuming information from it)\n- Encourage continuous inspection and update to the information presented', 'You have business processes in place. You know they exist, else you would get little done. But you want to get a higher level understanding of your processes. You may wonder if your process are as smooth as they can be, as efficient as they can be and if they are helping or hindering overall performance. To get a better understanding of your processes, text based procedures and checklists aren’t going to help much. Time to look into some visual process mapping techniques. The first we’ll look at is the ever handy and easily created swim lane diagram. Read on to learn how process mapping with swim lanes create operational transparency, accountability and contribute to the efficiency of organizations.\nWhat is a Swim Lane Diagram?\nA swim lane diagram, also called a cross functional flow chart, or swim lane process map, is an element used in mapping process workflows. It groups components into a distinct sequence, or lane, in the visual presentation of workflow and process charts. Swimlane diagrams distinguish capabilities, roles, and responsibilities for each sub-process in business process workflows.\nIn swim lane maps, parallel lines divide the chart into lanes, hence the name, with one lane for each person, group or sub process. Take a look:\nLanes are labelled to show how the chart is organized. For example, a vertical lane may represent a sequence of events, while the horizontal lanes depict what department, person, or material is involved, with arrows and other standard symbols to show how the actual process workflow takes place.\nWhat are the benefits of using a swim lane process map?\nThese highly versatile cross functional flow charts can communicate complex principles on a more intuitive visual level. Unlike other workflow diagrams, swim lane diagrams help to build a standardized, integrated process map across the organization that can be analyzed for inefficiencies and aid improvements. Let’s take a look.\n1. Clarify Complex Processes\nOrganising processes into swim lanes can provide easy visual explanations even for complex relationships. (See adjacent example of a simple vertical swim lane diagram).\nMany complex process relationships are never fully illuminated due to the tendency for word and text based explanations to be hard to follow and, well, easy to ignore.\nA swim lane process map, by comparison, creates a visual structure to both process workflow and the people, places, and things that interact with them. What used to be hidden in obscure procedures is revealed more comprehensively in a swim lane process mapping session.\nSwim lane diagrams help identify and organize\n- bottlenecks and inefficiencies\n- department and team responsibility\n- the relationship between teams, steps and overall process\nCostly delays and redundancies may exist not merely as the result of duplicate or wasted efforts and tasks, but can also be due to of a lack of documentation or other breakdowns in communication. The visual nature of a swim lane allows these issues to not only be brought into the discussion but to become necessary places of process improvement. Giving the problem a visual structure makes the problem much harder to ignore and can act as a catalyst for a implements continuous process improvement.\n2. Better Understanding and Communication\nCreating swim lanes for processes at each new initiative can help all parties better understand exactly what is taking place, whether it’s top executives or general labor. As mentioned above, swim lane maps require the discovery and listing of all tasks and sub-processes, as well\nas the decision making that affects the workflow.\nA Swim lane process map also helps encourage effective communication between process roles. For example, swim lane diagrams require that each process be segmented into a series of tasks which all lead to a desired end result, showing all responsible parties. Whether it’s improving production times, installing a new computer system, or on boarding new hires, the diagram shows everyone what their responsibility is and how it affects others.\nThis methodology also helps to guide processes. A swim lane diagram provides a visual reference so that anyone can easily answer questions such as “What happens now?” or “Who is supposed to take care of this?”.\n3. Identify Participants\nAs mentioned above, working out each team or individual responsibility is important for both current and future initiatives. This should include each organizational unit involved in the sequence of tasks, as well as any source of input, such as documents, data, or approvals, and anyone receiving any output from the process, such as vendors or even computer systems.\nWhile diagrams can be constructed at any level of detail, in-depth swim lane diagrams will reveal steps where additional help or skills are called for, or even team members that are not required, or who are being over-worked or under-used.\n4. A Versatile Process Mapping Tool\nSwim lane maps provide flexibility to visually diagramming and understanding processes. Various levels of complexity can be introduced to provide overviews or map specific details. Symbols representing outside data, documents or outside process events can be incorporated into the swim lane diagram along with the standard process start, step, decision and end symbols. There are a total of 6 standard symbols in all and these can be used for the vast majority of your process mapping needs.\nAlso, workflows can be rotated in the diagram so that sequences read horizontally and roles become a column. This can help to create a different perspective emphasizing personnel duties rather than process sequences.\n5. Easy Analysis for Continuous Improvement\nAs the flowchart progresses, it’s repeatedly checked for issues such as missing steps, duplication of effort, poor time management and activities that add no real value. Eliminating any or all of these results in a better process. A swim lane process map helps to make these improvements easier to spot by providing a visual, orderly context.\nOnce areas needing improvement are identified, analysts can explore ways to address each issue and make the right changes. Using swim lane process maps can also help to map out proposed changes so that potential risks and rewards can be identified. For instance, it makes sense to eliminate a duplicated step, but the step may be necessary due to time constraints or quality controls\nSwim Lane Process Maps with the Agility Systems Process Based Management System\nIn keeping with the holistic process based approach to business management systems, the Agility Systems integrated management system revolves around the use of easily built and visual swim lane maps. The highly intuitive and highly adaptive swim lane graphics allow you to tailor your specific processes to your overall business goals. This gives you and your team the visual ability to clarify the complex, understand the problems and identify the key roles, streamlining your processes from top to bottom for a more efficient and ultimately cost saving process improvement system.']	['<urn:uuid:cd4e5f60-ef62-42f8-892f-18c04a7a0090>', '<urn:uuid:ce222a6c-ade8-42dd-8abb-746d09add25f>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	29	125	1660
7	What wild animals can a garden attract?	Wild flower meadows attract diverse wildlife including spiders spinning webs, caterpillars, butterflies, moths, bees gathering pollen, birds foraging for insects and seeds, and small mammals searching for food. Additionally, creating shrubby borders around the lawn to simulate a woodland clearing may attract badgers and foxes.	"[""Planning a lawn\nBefore you create a new lawn, plan how you want it to look and think about how you can share it with wildlife.\nWildlife in mind\nBefore you create a new lawn, plan how you want it to look but also think about how you can share it with wildlife.\nLawns like plenty of light and an open aspect is often best, but you can grow grass almost anywhere - even in a container on a terrace. Small gardens may only be able to accommodate short grass, but you can plan a full range of grass structures in medium and large gardens.\nYou might like a more formal lawn, maintained as short grass, in your front garden if you have one, and introduce a more wildlife friendly one in the back.\nIf you have moved into a house with what appears to be a derelict lawn, decide if you want to start from scratch or renovate it - it could contain some amazing wildlife already, such as wild orchids.\nIt’s always best to avoid straight edges if possible. Curved or wavy edges increase the 'edge to area' ratio, allowing you to plant a bigger variety of plants between the lawn and border. This in turn, increases opportunities for insects and provides birds with a source of insect food, seeds and fruits.\nAnother idea would be to create a gentle slope in your lawn, away from your house. This will help give the lawn depth and take any surface water away.\nTurf or seed?\nDecide if you want to lay turf or sow seed for your lawn and calculate how much you need. Turf is usually sold by the square metre and seed estimated at 70g/square metre (2oz/square yard).\nTurf provides ‘instant lawn’, but is the more expensive option. If you need your lawn to be hard wearing and for amenity use, the cheapest turf with rye grass will be sufficient. For a more formal lawn, ask for a turf grown with fine grasses. Although this is more expensive, fine grasses require less mowing and, unlike rye grass, do not grow as tall and become susceptible to ‘falling over’ or 'bolting'. They are also better suited for enhancing with meadow flowers.\nIf seeding, a hardwearing mix with rye grass is suitable for lawns likely to get heavy use. Fine grasses are suited for lighter use. Once again, there is a difference in cost.\nIncorporating meadow flowers\nYou can incorporate spring or summer meadow flowers in the whole lawn or just part of it. Summer meadows are cut in September; spring meadow flowers bloom early in the year and the grass is cut in early summer.\nDesignating a proportion of your lawn to meadow means you can seed the lawn with a fine grass mix and will only require a small amount of wildflower seed. Approximately 20grms/square metre (0.5oz/square yard) of wildflower mix should be sufficient, but varies depending on soil type. Check with your supplier when ordering.\nMake sure the flower seeds you buy are suitable for the soil type and that the species composition is compatible with what grows naturally in your area. Ensure seeds are of local provenance.\nWild flower meadows make great habitats\nWild flower meadows are extraordinarily beautiful and teeming with wildlife: spiders spinning webs, caterpillars munching leaves, butterflies and moths supping nectar, all sorts of bees gathering pollen, birds foraging for insects and seeds and small mammals searching for food.\nNowadays wild flower meadows are extremely rare – we have lost 95 per cent in the last 50 years. Planting one in your garden will really help local wildlife.\nCreate a woodland area\nMuch of Britain used to be covered by woodland and thousands of species are adapted to live in this habitat. However, few native woods survive today and the area of this habitat is decreasing.\nNatural woods have a distinct layered structure:\n- the canopy with taller trees such as beech and lime\n- small trees and shrubs, for instance hazel and holly\n- herbs, such as bluebells and violets\n- the ground with mosses and fungi.\nLight reaches the woodland floor in winter and spring, allowing many plants to flourish. In autumn the fallen leaves rot to form a rich humus layer.\nMake the most of your garden\n- In very small gardens plant ferns and foxgloves in a shady spot.\n- Remove a few shrubs that are close together, improve the soil beneath and plant shade-loving plants.\n- Plant some snowdrops or winter aconites beneath an existing tree.\n- If planting a new woodland area choose native trees (of a suitable size) – they support more wildlife eg oak and silver birch.\n- Create shrubby borders around the lawn to simulate a woodland clearing – you may attract badgers and foxes.\nWoodlands are Britain's richest and most diverse habitats. Much woodland wildlife is adapted to the 'edge' or 'glade', so a small woodland in your garden could benefit hundreds of species.""]"	['<urn:uuid:c4a1460e-7195-4d1c-b31e-194c23dd26dc>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	7	45	832
8	I'm studying zero-waste implementation challenges - what educational approaches were used to gain community acceptance in Kamikatsu's waste program, and what permit-related obstacles might similar initiatives face in urban settings?	In Kamikatsu, education was key to gaining community acceptance, involving classes and information campaigns to help residents understand the context and demonstrate that waste segregation wasn't as difficult as initially perceived. However, similar initiatives in urban areas would face permit-related obstacles, as municipalities often require specific permits for various aspects of community projects, including activities like tearing up grass, building fences, or keeping urban livestock. These permits need to be secured before implementation to avoid legal issues.	"['News Environment The Beautiful Thing That Happened When This Japanese Town Went (Almost) Waste-Free By Starre Vartan Starre Vartan Writer Columbia University Syracuse University Starre Vartan is an environmental and science journalist. She holds an MFA degree from Columbia University and Geology and English degrees from Syracuse University. Learn about our editorial process Updated August 19, 2021 This story is part of Treehugger\'s news archive. Learn more about our news archiving process or read our latest news. Akira Sakano, founder of Zero Waste Academy CROP FOR SOCIAL. (Photo: Zero Waste Academy, Japan) Share Twitter Pinterest Email News Environment Business & Policy Science Animals Home & Design Current Events Treehugger Voices News Archive Yes, the town of Kamikatsu, which is on the Western Japanese island of Shikoku, is small — just under 1,600 people. But an experiment in going zero waste has shown the world that our garbage has far-reaching effects, and not just on our environment. It all started when the town, which is surrounded by rice fields and forests, built a new incinerator almost 20 years ago. But almost immediately, the incinerator was determined to be a health risk due to the number of dioxins it released into the air when garbage was burned in it. It was too expensive to send waste to other towns, so locals had to come up with a new plan. From this conundrum, the Zero Waste Academy was born. According to their website, ""The Zero Waste Academy provides services to change: the perspectives & actions of people; ownership and usage of things; and social systems, to turn waste into valuables."" Now Kamikatsu residents separate their waste into 45 different categories, including the basics like paper, plastics, metal, glass, furniture and food waste — but then there are many subcategories too. Paper gets sorted out into newspaper, cardboard, coated paper cartons, shredded paper and more. Metals get separated by type. ""By doing this level of segregation, we can actually turn it over to the recycler knowing that they will treat it as a high-quality resource,"" Akira Sakano, the founder of Zero Waste Academy, told World Ecoomic Forum. From chore to community In the beginning, it wasn\'t easy to convince local residents to do all this work, and there was some pushback. Communication was the key to changing minds; they held classes and ran an information campaign. ""While there was still a bit of conflict, part of the community started to understand the context and cooperate, so the municipal office decided to start the segregated collection system. Once the residents saw that it had started, they realized that it wasn\'t that difficult,"" Sakano said. After that initial education period, most residents came on board. Many now separate their waste into general categories at home, and then do a more refined segregation at the station. This is all great news for waste reduction of course (the town hasn\'t quite gotten to their goal of zero-waste yet, but aims to by 2020), but it has also had some unexpected social benefits as well. Like much of Japan, Kamikatsu\'s population is aging, and about 50 percent of the locals are elderly. The fact that the whole community takes their trash in to be recycled has created a hub of local action and interaction between generations. That idea has been purposefully expanded to include a circular shop where household goods are dropped off and others can take them, and a tableware ""library"" where people can borrow extra cups, glasses, silverware and plates for celebrations (eliminating the need for single-use disposables). A craft center takes in old fabrics and sewing supplies — including old kimonos — and locals make new items from them. ""[The elderly] see this not as a waste-collection service, but an opportunity to socialize with the younger generation and to chat. When we visit them, they prepare lots of food and we stay with them for a while, we ask how they are,"" Sakano told the World Economic Forum. Sakano wants to see her community\'s dual success — reducing waste and creating community — expanded elsewhere. She says that people being more involved with their waste, seeing where it goes and understanding what happens to it, is key to changing how we all consume. The Zero Waste Center reports on how much has been recycled, where it goes and what it\'s made into. Part of changing people\'s relationship to consumable stuff also includes educating locals into not buying products that aren\'t recyclable. Sakano says the only thing standing in the way of 100 percent zero waste for her town is the fact that some manufacturers still use non-recyclable packaging and materials in their products. Sakano says, ""Products need to be designed for the circular economy, where everything is reused or recycled. These actions really need to be taken to businesses and incorporate producers, who need to consider how to deal with the product once its useful life has ended."" Sakano\'s ideas are truly revolutionary if you think about it. She\'s proving that community can be found through handling the stuff we no longer want and need. If shopping can be a relationship-building activity (which it\'s certainly advertised as being), why not the results of the shopping too?', 'Growing produce in your own backyard or a community garden can be an amazing experience that allows you to not only choose the produce you consume, but have control of the process from seed to harvest. Issues affecting urban gardens aren’t usually at front of mind when you decide it’s time to open up the soil in your yard or rent a garden plot, but there’s a lot more to consider than just where to buy your seeds.\nProblems with Urban Gardens\nMost urban garden problems aren’t readily apparent when you first dig the soil, but they are very real. Here are some of the most common things to consider before you plant:\nPermits. Depending on where your garden is located, you may need a permit for tearing up the grass, building a fence or keeping urban livestock like chickens, bees and goats. Check with your local municipality before putting in the garden of your dreams to avoid finding out the hard way that it’s not allowed. A lot of urban gardening problems can be prevented by procuring the right permits the first time.\nThe human element. We all want to assume that our neighbors are both helpful and supportive of our garden efforts, but that’s not always the truth. It’s a good idea to talk to neighbors before starting a front yard garden and to erect a fence where there’s a lot of foot traffic. Produce theft is a real thing and happens to disappointed urban gardeners everywhere.\nSun protection. Urban community gardens are especially susceptible to problems with sunscald and radiant heat because many are constructed in areas littered with plenty of concrete, pavement and large structures. When these surfaces warm up through the day, they can literally hold onto the heat for hours and cook your plants well beyond nightfall.\nContaminated soils. Even if the soil in your urban garden is healthy and rich, it may be hiding secret contamination from the past. Lead contamination is by far the biggest risk, and although most vegetable plants won’t uptake lead into their systems, it can be a problem if you don’t wash produce thoroughly or a child eats the soil in the garden. Having a soil test for heavy metals is good practice before you get to gardening.\nOzone. Burning gasoline and other fossil fuels can result in ozone pollution near the ground. Although there’s little you can do to protect plants from this hazard, knowing ozone is a problem can help direct your gardening efforts. Ozone-resistant garden plants are being developed, but aren’t available to the public yet. Until then, you may want to move gardens to areas further away from roads and sources of pollution.\nWater supply. Rainwater gardening is romantic and earthy, but not every area has rainwater that’s safe to use for gardening. Pollutants can concentrate in rainwater in urban areas, injuring plants and causing potential harm to gardeners. Municipal water may also be suspect, depending on native minerals and additives, like fluoride, which can hurt sensitive plants. Accessing useable water can be a trick in some areas, especially where drought and water rationing are common. Plan ahead for water long before you start to plant.']"	['<urn:uuid:b684fd76-8461-4e6c-8950-69e67964adb0>', '<urn:uuid:08ac9338-96d1-4325-a16f-720d0cbea998>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	30	77	1402
9	I'm doing research on bat species in Western Australia and I'm wondering what specific habitat requirements were found for Vespadelus regulus bats in tuart woodlands?	Vespadelus regulus bats showed a significant correlation with canopy cover of trees taller than 10m, indicating that vegetation structure, particularly tall tree canopy, is an important habitat element for this species.	['Is tuart (Eucalyptus gomphocephala) decline detrimental for fauna?\nWentzel, Jacobus Johannes (2010) Is tuart (Eucalyptus gomphocephala) decline detrimental for fauna? PhD thesis, Murdoch University.\nTree declines, characterised by gradual but widespread loss of vigour and subsequent death of either single or several tree species, are a global phenomenon with landscape-scale consequences. Tree declines can be caused by a wide range of biotic (e.g. pests and pathogens) and abiotic (e.g. salinity and drought) factors. In turn, both biotic and abiotic elements of the environment are modified as a result of tree decline. Despite the massive scale of these changes, the effects of tree decline upon fauna are not clearly understood and are still poorly researched. For example, empirical evidence exists for the effects of tree declines upon fauna only in a handful of bird, small mammal and reptile studies, conducted mainly in North America. The majestic tuart (Eucalyptus gomphocephala) tree once dominated the Swan Coastal Plain in Western Australia (WA). Today, tuart woodlands occur over less than a third of their former range, and the remnant woodlands are heavily affected by decline of unknown cause(s). This study examines the effect of tuart decline upon reptiles, birds and mammals.\nResearch was conducted in twenty-four 1-ha sites in Yalgorup National Park. Sites were selected for high tuart density and ranged from declining (characterised by crown dieback, dead branches and even dead trees) to healthy (i.e. dense canopy with no dieback). The health of individual tuart in the 24 sites was quantified for comparison between sites. Other habitat covariates quantified were the amount of litter, coarse woody debris, vegetation structural attributes and woody plant species composition. Reptile and mammal data were gathered through a system of trapping lines established for each site, while bat abundance was determined by recording their unique echolocation calls with Anabat recorders. The presence of bird species was quantified by area searches at each site. As complex combinations of environmental factors typically determine the presence or absence of faunal species, multiple regression analyses were used to identify habitat parameters significantly associated with the distribution of these taxa. To quantify differences between vertebrate communities in healthy and declining sites, analyses of similarity (ANOSIM) were conducted. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) were conducted to visually represent differences in vertebrate communities in ‘healthy’ and ‘declining’ tuart sites.\nTuart decline brought about significant changes to fauna habitat, particularly with reference to canopy characteristics, litter and understorey density. ‘Healthy’ and ‘declining’ tuart stands were significantly different (ANOSIM), based upon the habitat variables found at each site. These changes clearly affected vertebrates. The assemblage composition of reptile, bat and bird species in ‘healthy’ and ‘declining’ sites were significantly different, while it was not the case with non-volant mammals. Reptile, bird and mammal species reacted variably to tuart decline and associated habitat parameters.\nThe abundance of several reptile species was significantly correlated with vegetation structure and the amount of litter. For example, Acritoscincus trilineatum skinks were associated with dense canopy and understorey, and tuart decline negatively affects this species.\nContrary to expectations, several bird species and guilds were significantly positively associated with tuart decline, particularly hollow-nesters, canopy insectivores and granivores. Diversification of habitat (e.g. tuart with some dead branches and epicormic growth) seems to benefit these birds. These benefits can be linked to the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis where moderate levels of disturbance benefit biodiversity. By contrast, some specialist foragers (e.g. nectarivores) were negatively affected by tuart decline. The negative effect of tuart decline on nectarivores is a source of concern as it implies potential major ecological effects on the ecosystem through the disruption of pollination services.\nThe abundance of only one non-volant mammal species, Isoodon obesulus, was positively correlated with a habitat parameter (shrub cover), while the other non-volant mammal species were not affected by tuart decline. By contrast, vegetation structure was an important bat habitat element for Vespadelus regulus and Nyctophilus spp. bats, which were significantly correlated with canopy cover of trees taller than 10m. Falsistrellus mackenziei was negatively affected by tuart crown dieback, and given the limited distribution and close association of this bat species with tall trees, it is suggested that F. mackenziei be used as indicator species to assess the effect of tuart decline upon fauna. Characteristics of post- tuart decline plant communities will ultimately determine the extent of the effect of tuart decline upon fauna.\nSuccessional plant species with similar characteristics (e.g. canopy cover and litter production) and function as tuart may result in amelioration of the negative effects of tuart decline. If modification of vegetation structure and changes to leaf litter characteristics and microclimate are within the tolerance threshold of faunal species and their prey, the effect of changes in tuart health may be less severe than initially anticipated. On the other hand, successional plant species with very different characteristics than that of tuart will result in modified environmental parameters that may negatively affect fauna associated with tuart woodlands through altered habitat and food resources on which they depend, and could ultimately result in the loss of fauna species.\n|Publication Type:||Thesis (PhD)|\n|Murdoch Affiliation:||School of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology|\n|Supervisor:||Fleming, Trish, Hardy, Giles, Barber, Paul and Craig, Michael|\n|Item Control Page|\nDownloads per month over past year']	['<urn:uuid:6a932b2c-5d6f-4782-b223-49368e58c090>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	25	31	864
10	banff national park harlequin duck banding program total birds banded bow river lake louise	Since May 1995, wardens, with help from the Canadian Wildlife Service and local volunteers, have banded a total of 83 harlequin ducks on the Bow River near Lake Louise. Each duck received a uniquely numbered red plastic band on the left leg and a standard international numbered aluminum band on the right leg.	"[""Banff National Park of Canada\nHarlequin Ducks - Whitewater Specialists\n© Parks Canada\nHarlequin ducks ( Histrionicus histrionicus ) are small, colourful\nsea ducks that winter in coastal areas and migrate inland during the summer\nto nest along mountain streams. Harlequins are known to nest in Banff and other\nmountain parks and may be seen on fast moving water or upper elevation lakes\nfrom late April to September.\nHarlequins are small ducks with rounded heads, stubby bills, and short stocky bodies. The drakes (males) have a striking plumage of dark blue, rust, and bold white streaks. The hens (females) are much more discrete; their subtle brown colour camouflages them for nesting. Hens can be distinguished from other female ducks by three white patches on each side of their face. Juveniles look similar to adult females.\nThe birds' Latin name, Histrionicus, means a stage player or actor. The birds certainly look and play the part, as the males vigorously defend their mates with head bobbing displays. Harlequins work rapids and rough surf like expert boatmen, using their large, powerful feet to propel their buoyant bodies through the turbulent water. When moving upstream they often clamber over boulders to detour rapids. They tuck into eddies behind boulders to rest before diving to the bottom. Harlequins are swift flyers and, like American dippers, their flight path may be indirect as they follow the exact course of the river, barely above the surface.\nFreshwater invertebrates such as the larvae of blackflies, stoneflies, caddisflies, and mayflies are the favoured prey in mountain rivers. Fish eggs are also consumed when available. At their coastal home they use their stubby bill to pry invertebrates such as snails, limpets, crabs, chitons, and mussels from the rocks during the winter months. In the late winter months they feed on herring spawn in large congregations.\nHarlequin Duck Nesting Habitat\n© Parks Canada\nThe harlequin is the only North American duck that migrates inland to nest along turbulent mountain streams. They favour areas of low human disturbance, where the waters are clear and clean.\nThe nesting habits of the harlequin duck are a well kept secret. They are experts at hiding the nest among low vegetation, stumps, logs, woody debris, or river boulders; occasionally open gravel bars or a cliff face above the rushing water may be used. The nest may be located as much as 50 metres from water's edge. The hen chooses the nest site, and after the eggs are laid the male promptly abandons her and returns to the coast. The hen lays 5 - 7 creamy buff eggs and incubates them for 28 - 30 days.\nHarlequin Duck Marine Habitat\n© Parks Canada\nFor most of the year, Pacific harlequin ducks inhabit exposed rocky sea coasts from Alaska to Oregon. Harlequin ducks that breed in Banff National Park and other areas of the eastern slopes of the Rockies winter in the Strait of Georgia in British Columbia. They congregate around points, reefs and islands to feed on the rich underwater marine life.\nStatus and Human Threats\nHarlequin ducks occur in two separate populations: on both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. They inhabit eastern Asia, North America, Greenland, and Iceland. In North America, the Pacific population probably numbers over 200,000 while in the Atlantic there are less than 2,000 harlequin ducks remaining.\nThe latter population has declined significantly over the last century and is now designated as an endangered species in eastern Canada. The harlequin duck is yellow-listed in Alberta and British Columbia, reflecting the growing concern over declining populations and human impacts. Population declines have been attributed to overhunting, oil pollution, recreational activities, and loss of nesting habitat to hydro-electric projects, road construction, logging, mining, and degradation of riparian areas.\nWhy Protect Harlequin Ducks?\nGlobally, harlequin ducks are an integral part of the natural ecosystem and are indicators of pristine environments. Preserving mountainous and coastal environments for harlequin ducks will benefit numerous other species which are also dependent on these areas.\nAny information on the ecology of Pacific harlequin ducks may also aid recovery efforts in eastern Canada, and may help avoid further declines in the western population. Researchers throughout western North America are joining forces to learn more about the habits and habitats of these unique birds, with the end goal of protecting them throughout their summer and winter ranges.\nViewing the Harlies\nHarlequin ducks are exciting and often entertaining to watch, but they must not be disturbed. Please take care when watching them. Don't venture close to them and keep noise and movement to a minimum.\nYou can Help\nPlease consult the Banff National Park web site for current updates on research activities.\nWe are interested in collecting harlequin duck sightings throughout the Canadian Rockies. Please report them to (403) 762-1470.\nHarlequin Duck Banding\n© Parks Canada\nSince May, 1995, wardens, with the assistance of the Canadian Wildlife Service and local volunteers, have banded a total of 83 harlequin ducks on the Bow River near Lake Louise. Each duck was fitted with a uniquely numbered red plastic band on the left leg and the standard international numbered aluminum band on the right leg. Subsequent sightings of banded birds will help researchers to gather population and habitat use data. In May, 1996, a cooperative project was undertaken in Kananaskis Country east of Banff park. A total of 31 birds were banded then.\n© Parks Canada\nThese banding projects are part of an international program throughout western Canada and the United States, whereby researchers are cooperating to gain knowledge of the habits and habitats of these unique birds, with the end goal of protecting them throughout their summer and winter ranges.\nOur records show that harlequin ducks are found throughout Banff National Park, but the Bow River appears to be particularly important as a staging and breeding area. The stretch between Lake Louise and Castle Junction has one of the highest concentrations on a Spring range in western North America. Many of these birds nest in the park, but some likely travel farther east to the rivers and streams of the foothills.\nAlready we have sighted birds that were banded since 1993 in the Strait of Georgia near Campbell River, British Columbia, and Port Townsend, Washington. This is helping us to track where our harlequin ducks spend time when they're not in the park. Gathering sightings of banded birds throughout Banff National Park and the eastern slopes is a critical part of our study.""]"	['<urn:uuid:2f4012a4-77ed-4eda-90fc-dabdc2a83b5b>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	14	53	1077
11	What happens when you send wastewater samples to remote laboratories for analysis, and why might this be problematic?	When samples are sent to a remote laboratory, the results are typically received 24 hours or more after the event, making immediate remedial action on site impossible. Additionally, the sample degrades during transit.	"[""Activated Sludge Process Overview: The process deals with the treatment of sewage (and industrial wastewater) and was developed around 1912-1914. Activated sludge is a biochemical process for treating sewage and industrial wastewater that uses air (or oxygen) and microorganisms to biologically oxidize organic pollutants, producing a waste sludge (or floc) containing the oxidized material. Atmospheric air or pure oxygen is bubbled through primary treated sewage (or industrial wastewater) and combined with organisms to develop a biological floc which reduces the organic content of the sewage. The combination of raw sewage and biological mass is commonly known as Mixed Liquor. In all activated sludge plants, once the sewage (or industrial wastewater) has received sufficient treatment, excess mixed liquor is discharged into settling tanks and the treated supernatent is run off to undergo further treatment before discharge. Part of the settled material, the sludge (RAS), is returned to the head of the aeration system to re-seed the new sewage entering the tank. Mixed Liquor is a mixture of raw or settled wastewater and activiated sludge within an aeration tank in the activated sludge process. Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids (MLSS) is the concentration of suspended solids in the mixed liquor, usually expressed in milligrams per litre (mg/l).\nWhy Measure MLSS\nIf MLSS content is too high the process is prone to bulking and the treatment system becomes overloaded, this can cause the dissolved oxygen content to drop with the effect that organic matters are not fully degraded and biological 'die off'. Conversely, if the MLSS content is too low the process is not working efficiently, and is likely to be wasting energy whilst not treating the effluent effectively.The typical control band is 2,000 to 4,000 mg/l.\nRAS and SAS\nA proportion of the floc is called Return Activated Sludge (R.A.S.) and is used to maintain the desied MLSS value. Measuring the solids concentration of RAS allows the return volume to be adjusted to keep the solids level in the aeration basin within the control parameters. Excess sludge which eventually accumulates beyond that returned is defined as Surplus or Waste Activated Sludge (SAS/WAS). This is removed from the treatment process to keep the ratio of biomass to food supplied (sewage or wastewater) in balance. Typical Range: 4,000 to 6,000 mg/l.\nThe sample is sent away to a remote laboratory and the results are typically received 24hours+ after the event, this makes remedial action on site during the inital visit impossible. Additionally the sample degrades in transit.\nSite Settling Jars\nThe test takes 30 minutes or more and is extremely operator dependent, this means that a site can be kept in control when the same operator is looking after the site and has time to make the measurement carefully. If the operator changes or if time is limited the validity of the settling jar test becomes very questionable.\nPortable SS Monitor\nMeasurement using a properly calibrated portable monitor is now very reliable andrepeatable, the data is also available immediately and can be used to make site adjustmens to improve the performance of the site.\nFixed installation Monitor\nWith a permantently installed monitor 24/7 trending and alarming is available. This brings in the possibility of automated control, which improves plant efficiency by providing stability and continuity to the treatment process.Continuous On-Line Monitoring reduces the need for time-consuming laboratory analysis, removes operator dependancy from the measurement.""]"	['<urn:uuid:80fe9ae8-d6c1-427c-9e2e-eee35e8dd873>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	18	33	559
12	Can you explain if Shiva is seen differently in Benares compared to how he's viewed in general Hinduism?	In Benares (Varanasi), Shiva is worshipped as Mahadeva, the great god or Ishwara, representing the powers of all the Trimurti (Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva). While in general Hinduism Shiva is primarily seen as the destroyer and one part of the trinity, in Benares he is elevated to a supreme position - it is his city, and any Hindu who dies there is believed to go straight to heaven. The principal temples in Benares are dedicated to him.	"['« PreviousContinue »\ning the nature of the soul and the origin of the universe had resolved themselves into definite shape as the six schools or darsanas of philosophy, all taking for their foundation the axiom that ex nihilo nihil fit, and all directed to one end-the cessation of the cycle of re-births and absorption of the soul of man into the one Supreme Soul. They also agree in recognizing the operation of the law of karma, adopted by Buddha, through which every human action is held to entail a consequence upon the agent, good or evil accord ing to the character of the action, which follows him or her through the whole cycle of transmigrations.\nThe caste system had become firmly established, and the Brahmins had assumed extravagant pretensions to spiritual superiority, but the creed of the lower classes had been raised to a distinctly higher plane by the doctrines of the Bhagavat Gita, “ The Song of the Blessed One""; incorporated with the Mahâbhârata, probably in the first few centuries of the Christian era. The idea of a personal God, as creator and preserver of the universe, its high moral standard and the similarity of some of its passages to the New Testament, have caused many Christian missionaries to attribute the Bhagavat Gita to the influence of early Christian converts, and to intellectual intercourse between India and the schools of Alexandria. Max Müller and other Sanskrit authorities reject this theory. However this may be, the Bhagavat Gita is now by far the most popular of all Brahminical sacred writings. It is translated into all the principal vernaculars. Pocket editions of it are carried about by Hindus of all classes, just as devout Christians may carry the Bible. It has unHINDUISM ABSORBS BUDDHISM 63 doubtedly profoundly influenced the ethical and spiritual ideas of modern Hinduism.\nSankaracharya waged relentless war against the superstitions of the Buddhists of his time, and against the loathsome practices of some of the Hindu sects; but convinced of the futility of attempting to supersede entirely the ancient forms of popular worship by the high philosophic doctrines of the intellectual Brahmins, he effected a compromise. Buddha had established an ethical code which afforded a common meetingground for all races, classes, and sects of Hindus, but nad left untouched the problems of the first Cause and the directing Power of the Universe. Sankaracharya and other Brahmin teachers provided a com mon metaphysical basis for all popular religious beliefs, while allowing the widest latitude for various forms of worship.\nIt is not to be supposed that Sankaracharya was the first to teach the pantheistic doctrines of Hinduism. The idea of the One Supreme Being manifested in the many had been clearly indicated centuries before in the Upanishads, and developed in the Vedanta school of philosophy, but Sankaracharya\'s preaching marks the final absorption of Buddhism into the Brahminical system, and the development of the worship of Shiva into one of the most popular cults. Shiva-worship had indeed existed long before the eighth century, and perhaps is older than Hinduism itself. One of Shiva\'s names, Rudra, is the name of the Vedic stormgod. Shiva is mentioned several times in the Mahabharata, and we learn from Hiuen Thsang that in the first half of the seventh century Shiva was already the principal deity of Benares. Nevertheless it was\nSankaracharya\'s teaching and philosophy which established Shivaism, for the time being, as the principal sect of Hinduism.\nThe Buddhist monasteries continued to exist at Sarnath, and elsewhere in India, until they were finally destroyed by the Muhammadan invaders of the thirteenth century; but in the eighth century Buddhism as a separate religion was already discredited, and the Brahmins were reinstated in their position as the spiritual leaders of the people. After the establishment of Muhammadan rule the popularity of the cult of Shiva, as expounded by Sankaracharya, diminished, and many new sects successively developed in which the worship of Vishnu and the idea of a personal God became more prominent. It is, however, impossible to follow the further development of Hinduism through all the different phases which have originated, and are still creating, new sects and schools of thought. We must now pass on to a brief study of the ideas of modern Hinduism as conveyed in the worship of Shiva, the presiding deity of Benares.\nIt will be understood from the preceding sketch that, through the absorption of many primitive faiths and modes of worship into the Brahminical system, there is often a very wide difference between the popular views regarding the various Hindu divinities and the esoteric teaching of the Brahmin philosophy. The stories told in the Puranas and other later Sanskrit literature embody the wildest legends and superstitions, and attribute to Hindu gods and goddesses an abundant share of earthly passions and weaknesses. Many of these seeming fantastic stories are, however, metaphysical ideas conveyed in the form of allegory.\nAccording to the esoteric doctrine of Hinduism, first propounded in the Rig Veda, the universe was originally Soul only, nothing else whatsoever existed, active or inactive. The origin of Creation, described in the famous hymn of the Rig Veda (X, 129), proceeded from this Supreme Spirit, the Eternal Essence, or Brahman. • The first manifestation of this neuter Brahman-the Unknowable—when passing into a conditioned state, comparable to the passing of a human being from a state of profound sleep to a state of dreaming and then of waking, is known as Ishwara—the Self-the Lord and Cause of all things. The glory of Ishwara as Purusha, or Spirit, makes manifest Prakriti, the Essence of Matter, inherent in Brahman, but until now unmanifested. Ishwara, then, by means of his divine power, called sakti, causes Prakriti to take form. The forms of Prakriti thus evolved are the Trimurti, or Three Aspects of Ishwara-Brahmâ, who in the world of Matter performs the functions of Creator, and represents the condition of activity or motion; Vishnu, who is the Preserver, representing equilibrium and rhythm; and Shiva, who is the dissolving power. In Hindu painting and sculpture this act in the great drama of creation is represented by Ishwara, under the name of Narayana, floating on the waters of chaos and sleeping on the serpent Sesha, or Ananta, “the endless""—the symbol of eternitywhile Brahmâ, the Creator, springs from a lotus flower which is growing from Ishwara\'s navel.\nThe Trimurti, as representing Spirit-essence, have different qualities or conditions (gunas). Brahmå represents the quality of Being; Vishnu, Thought\n66 BENARES, THE SACRED CITY power; and Shiva, the quality of Bliss, the perfect beatitude of Nirvana. Purusha and Prakriti being . inert by themselves, each of the Trimurti have their saktis, or divine powers, which enable them to perform their functions in the universe. In popular Hinduism the saktis are regarded as the wives of the Trimurti. The sakti of Brahmâ is deified as Saraswati, the goddess of learning and wisdom; the sakti of Vishnu is Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity; and the sakti of Shiva, Durga, Gauri, or Káli, terrible goddesses to whom bloody sacrifices, and sometimes human victims, are offered.\nThe worship of Brahmâ has almost ceased as a popular religion, because his work in the universe is considered to be finished. Shiva is the presiding deity at Benares, and all the principal temples are dedicated to him. But Shiva at Benares is Mahadeva, the great god, or Ishwara, representing the powers of all the Trimurti; for the followers of particular cults, like that of Shiva, Vishnu, or of Kâli, generally ascribe to their special deity the exercise of all the divine functions. It must also be noted that each one of the Trimurti, besides the two main qualities, or gunas, attributed to him, has countless sub-manifestations corresponding to the infinite subdivisions of their duties in the cosmic order. Thus there are hundreds of temples and shrines at Benares with names ending in “-eshwar” (Ishwara), such as Tarak-eshwar, Ratn. eshwar, Som-eshwar, &c., all of which are Shiva temples dedicated to some particular manifestation of the Supreme Ishwara. The Hindu pantheon is estimated to contain 300,000,000 deities, but the Brahminical teaching clearly explains them as indicating the infinite manifestations of the One Supreme.', ""Samsara: The Cycle of Lives\nAll Hindus believe that the individual soul exists in a cycle of birth into a body, followed by death and then rebirth. The quality of the next life depends on the soul's Karma-the goodness or badness of their deeds in this life.\n.Hinduism is about the sort of life one should lead in order to be born into a better life next time and eventually become free from rebirth altogether by attaining Moksha (liberation)\nSo when someone dies, their soul is reborn into a new body (although not necessarily a human body). The cycle is called Samsara. The process of the soul being reborn into a new body is called Reincarnation.\nThe ultimate aim of the soul is to be freed from this cyc\nle. The quality of a life that the soul is born into depends on the previous life.\nWhether one is reborn into a better life, a worse life, or even to live as an animal., depends on Karma, which is the value of a soul's good and bad deeds.\nBelief in god:\nGod or gods?\nContrary to popular understanding, Hindus recognise one God, Brahman, the eternal origin who is the cause and foundation of all existence.\nThe gods of the Hindu faith represent different expressions of Brahman.\nDifferent Hindu communities may have their own divinities whom they worship, but these are simply different ways of approaching the Ultimate.\nHindus recognise three principal gods:\nBrahma, who creates the universe\nVishnu, who preserves the universe\nShiva (right), who destroys the universe.\nBrahma is the Creator. However, Brahma is not worshipped in the same way as other gods because it is believed that his work — that of creation — has been done.\nHindus worship other expressions of Brahman (not Brahma), which take a variety of forms.Hindus are often classified into three groups according to which form of Brahman they worship:\n--Those who worship Vishnu (the preserver) and Vishnu‘s important incarnations Rama, Krishna and Narasimha;\n--Those who worship Shiva (the destroyer)\n-- Those who worship the Mother Goddess, Shakti, also called Parvati, Mahalakshmi, Durga or Kali.\nVishnu, the preserver is believed to be linked to a very early sun god and is considered by his worshippers to be the greatest among the gods. He is also referred to as Narayana.\nVishnu preserves and protects the universe and has appeared on the earth through his avatars (incarnations) to save humankind from natural disasters or from tyranny.\nThe most well-known avatars are Rama (see Ramayana), Krishna, who destroyed the wicked and established a new order, Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, and Kalki.\nVishnu is represented in sculpture and painting in human form, often painted blue. Lakshmi is the consort of Vishnu who has appeared as the wife of each of Vishnu’s incarnations including Sita, wife of Prince Rama, and Rukmini, wife of Krishna. She is the goddess of wealth and good fortune who is offered special worship during the Divali festival.\nThe god Shiva is part of the Hindu Trinity, along with Vishnu and Brahma.He is considered to be everything by those who worship him: creator, preserver and destroyer. In Shiva, the opposites meet. Shiva the destroyer is a necessary part of the trinity because, without destruction, there can be no recreation.\nHis city is Varanasi, and any Hindu who dies there is believed to go straight to heaven. Shiva is the source of both good and evil who combines many contradictory elements.\nShiva has many consorts including Kali, often portrayed as wild and violent, Parvati, reknowned for her gentleness, and Durga, a powerful goddess created from the combined forces of the anger of several gods.\nMahadevi, and other Vedic Gods\nThe Great Goddess (Mahadevi)\nThe great Goddess appears as a consort of the principal male gods and encompasses the thousands of local goddesses or matas. These can be both beautiful and benign, like Lakshmi, or all-powerful destructive forces like Kali.\nShakti is contrasted with Shiva, whose masculine consciousness is powerless without the creative female energy.\nOther Vedic gods\nIndra, the god of storms was once the Vedic king of all gods but has, over time, lost some influence.\n-- Indra's main function is in leading the warriors (see caste system).\n-- Indra fights not only human enemies, but also demons.\nAgni is the Vedic god of fire and is one of the supreme gods of the Rig Veda.\n-- Agni is believed to take the offerings to the other world through fire.\n-- Agni is represented by the ram.\nVaruna is the third Vedic god whose influence persists today.\n-- Varuna presides over the orderliness of the universe.\n--Varuna rules over the night sky.\n-- Varuna is believed to know everything.""]"	['<urn:uuid:7afef1df-cb2d-4f9b-a5ca-1d11610f3f37>', '<urn:uuid:1e5ecb1c-eff3-4708-8bf9-9548bd0beb41>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	18	77	2149
13	gut bacteria health benefits and illness symptoms	Gut bacteria perform critical bodily functions and when balanced, they help digest food, boost immunity, and prevent infections. However, when there's an imbalance (dysbiosis), it can cause symptoms like stomach pain, bloating, gas, cramps, diarrhea or constipation. Additionally, gut bacteria imbalances may contribute to allergies, autoimmune diseases, and even anxiety and depression since 90% of serotonin is created in the gut.	['Antioxidants are molecules that fight free radicals in your body. Free radicals are compounds that can cause harm if their levels become too high in our body. They’re linked to multiple illnesses, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Our bodies have their antioxidant defenses to keep free radicals in check.\nHowever, antioxidants are also found in food, especially in fruits, vegetables, and other plant-based, whole foods. Several vitamins, such as vitamins E and C, are effective antioxidants. Hundreds of thousands of substances act as antioxidants. The most familiar ones are vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and other related carotenoids, along with the minerals selenium and manganese. They’re joined by glutathione, coenzyme Q10, lipoic acid, flavonoids, phenols, polyphenols, phytoestrogens, and many more. Most are naturally occurring, and their presence in food is likely to prevent oxidation or to serve as a natural defense against the local environment.\nBacteria are a large group of prokaryotic microorganisms (cells lacking a nucleus, as opposed to eukaryotic ones, that have a nucleus, and that form the human body) that were among the first life forms to appear on Earth. They are commonly found in most of the planet’s habitats and live in symbiotic (mutually beneficial), commensal (eating from the same dish) or parasitic (living in or on another organism and benefiting from it) relationships with plants, animals and humans. Many people believe that all bacteria are pathogens. Although some of them can be harmful, most of them are beneficial and necessary for remaining in good health.\nBacteria are 10 to 50 times smaller than human cells. In the human body, there are an estimated 40 trillion microorganisms, including at least 1000 different known species of bacteria with more than 3 million genes—that is, 150 times more genes than humans have. Large bacterial communities live on the skin and in our bodily cavities. The largest community lives in our guts: the gut microbiota.\nA genus of bacterial species naturally present in a mammal’s gut. You can also find these bacteria in fermented foods (such as dairy products) or dietary supplements.\nAbdominal bloating is a condition in which the abdomen swells and gets tight. More common in women, it can cause belly pain that varies from mild to intense. It is provoked by excess gas, when said gas does not pass through belching or flatulence and therefore builds up in the stomach and intestines, or by an excessive reaction to normal gas production e.g. hypersensitivity of the bowel. In general, people suffering from bloating have flatter bellies in the morning that progressively become more distended over the day.\nGut bacteria produce butyrate, an important short-chain fatty acid that supports digestive health, helps control inflammation, and even aids in preventing disease. Gut bacteria transform dietary fibres found in whole, plant foods called “prebiotics” because they nourish and encourage the health-promoting activities of beneficial bacteria in the gut microbiome.\nYour body produces less butyrate than other short-chain fatty acids, but it has many health benefits. It is needed for your overall gut health, as well as helping to make energy for some gut cells\nThe colon, also known as the large intestine, is the last part of the digestive tract. It allows the absorption of water and essential vitamins produced by gut bacteria and the transformation of non-digested residues, which is the origin of faeces. Shorter in length than the small intestine, with a longer transit time, the colon is considerably thicker in diameter and harbours the vast majority of the gut microbiota.\nThe term commensalism refers to a type of relationship between two different organisms that “eat from the same dish”. In this kind of relationship, neither benefits from the other or provokes any harm. It is, therefore, a neutral relationship. Other classes of relationships between organisms include mutualism, in which both organisms obtain benefits, or parasitism, where one profits from the other by harming it. Although “friendly” bacteria inhabiting our organism are usually referred to as commensal, research in this field suggests that the relationship between our gut microbiota and us is not merely commensal, but rather mutualistic.\nThis is a type of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) that can affect any part of the digestive system, from the mouth to the back passage, although it mostly occurs in the last section of the small intestine, the ileum, or the large intestine, the colon. Its most usual symptoms include diarrhoea, abdominal pain and extreme tiredness, as well as bloody stools and weight loss on occasion.\nThis disorder often begins gradually and becomes worse over time. People with Crohn’s disease sometimes go for long periods without any symptoms or very mild ones, known as remission periods. These phases can be followed by very troublesome periods during which the disease flares up. The exact cause of this disorder is unknown, although researchers point out some factors like genetics, and immune system anomaly that causes it to attack healthy bacteria in the gut, smoking or environmental factors (curiously, the disease is more common in Western countries than in the world’s developing areas).\nAlso called dysbacteriosis, it refers to an imbalance of microbial colonies, either in number or type, that have colonized the human body. This is most common in the digestive tract, but it can happen in any exposed surface or mucous membrane. Dysbiosis can affect digestion, absorption of nutrients, production of vitamins and controlling the growth of harmful microorganisms. A wide range of factors, such as changes in dietary habits or antibiotic use, can influence the delicate microbial balance and thus, lead to dysbiosis. Researchers believe that it may have a role in disorders such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), chronic fatigue, obesity or even certain cancers.\nFermentation is a chemical process by which an organism converts sugars and carbohydrates present in food into an acid or an alcohol. Humans have used it for centuries to turn raw materials into assimilable final products, in food such as yoghurt, kefir, cheese, bread, wine and beer, or even chocolate.\nThis is the name given to the community of microorganisms inhabiting the length and breadth of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. The composition of this microbial community is host-specific. Each individual’s gut microbiota can undergo endogenous and exogenous alterations. It is sometimes called human flora, microflora or gut flora. These terms, however, are less used by scientists as it leads to the incorrect idea that tiny plants colonise us, while the microorganisms making up our microbiota are different kinds of microbes\nHuman Microbiome Project. Launched in 2008, it was a five-year US National Institutes of Health (NIH) project that had the aim of identifying and characterising microbial communities found at multiple human body cavities and looking for correlations between changes in the microbiome and human health and diseases.\nSee gut flora/gut microbiota.\nThis term refers to the biological community of microorganisms living in the environment of the human gut. Although the bacteria belong to different groups and are present in our digestive systems in different quantities, they work as a team, playing an essential role in helping digest food, boosting the immune system, preventing infections and even influencing mood and behaviour.\nThe immune system is generally known as the body’s defence system against infectious organisms and other invaders. It is made up of a network of cells, tissues and specialized organs that communicate with each other and act through a cascade of biological reactions that involve cytokines. The immune response acts to destroy and eliminate the detected agent to prevent it from causing any harm to the host.\nInflammation is the body’s biological response as it aims to fight against an aggression. It can be characterized by specific symptoms such as redness, swelling, a feeling of heat or pain, or altered functions of the involved organ. Infection is caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, whereas inflammation is part of our innate immunity and does not necessarily imply an infection.\nInflammatory Bowel Disease (or IBD) covers Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Both disorders are characterized by an excessive swelling of the wall of one section of the digestive tract.\nIrritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common functional disorder of the gut affecting 15% to 20% of people worldwide (with a higher prevalence in women). Irritable Bowel Syndrome is the main motivation behind gastroenterology consultations. Researchers believe it may originate from an unbalanced gut microbiota.\nLactobacillus is a type of rod-shaped bacteria that normally inhabits our oral, digestive and genital cavities. It is also present in some fermented foods like yoghurts or dietary supplements. Its name comes from its ability to convert lactose and other sugars into lactic acid. Due to their effectiveness, lactobacilli are normally used for treating and preventing diarrhoea, including some infectious types such as rotavirus diarrhoea in children or traveller’s diarrhoea.\nThe term metagenome refers to the entire collection of microbial genes found in a particular environment (or ecosystem). Metagenomics is the method used to analyze this metagenome. It reflects the potential capacity of a specific ecosystem, what action their gens can implement. It also reflects which microorganisms are present.\nThe term ‘microbial ecology’ is used to refer to the study of microbes and their interactions with the environment, as well as with plants, animals and each other. Although they are the tiniest creatures on Earth, they have a deep impact on humans and the planet. That is why scientists believe the study of microbial ecology can lead us to find better solutions to environmental restoration, food production and bioengineering, for instance.\nResearchers usually refer to the human microbiome when talking about the entire collection of genes found in all of the microbial cells living in the human body. It is sometimes confused with microbiota, the word used to define the hundreds of trillions of microorganisms living in the human body.\nIt is the name given to the community of microorganisms that reside either on the surface or in different cavities of the body: the skin, the mouth, the ears, the vagina or the gastrointestinal tract, among others. (See gut microbiota)\nOften wrongly used as a synonym of the word “microbe”, microorganisms are single- or multiple-cell organisms, so tiny that they cannot be seen with the naked eye (microscopic). Microorganisms are diverse and include parasites, bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses. Microorganisms are the oldest form of life on Earth. The study of microorganisms is called microbiology.\nA pathogen is an infectious biological agent that can produce a disease in its host. The term is mostly used to describe microorganisms like virus, bacteria or fungi, among others. These agents can disrupt the normal physiology of plants, animals and humans.\nPolicosanol is a chemical most often obtained from sugar cane. It can also be made from other plants, such as wheat.\nPolicosanol is most commonly used for leg pain due to poor blood circulation (intermittent claudication). It is also used for high cholesterol and clogged arteries.\nPolicosanol seems to decrease cholesterol production in the liver and to increase the breakdown of LDL (low-density lipoprotein or “bad”) cholesterol. It also decreases the stickiness of particles in the blood known as platelets.\nPostbiotics are functional bioactive compounds, generated in a matrix during fermentation, which may be used to promote health. Postbiotics is used as an umbrella term for all synonyms and related terms of these microbial fermentation components. Therefore, postbiotics can include many different constituents including metabolites, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), microbial cell fractions, functional proteins, extracellular polysaccharides (EPS), cell lysates, teichoic acid, peptidoglycan-derived muropeptides and pili-type structures.\nFeeding and supporting commensal gut microbes through a diverse, plant-based diet of prebiotic fibre foods may ensure abundance of not only beneficial bacteria, but also those fermentation by-products, or postbiotics, that demonstrate nutritional, metabolic, and immune health benefits.\nPrebiotics are functional non-digestible food components (such as certain kinds of fibre) that stimulate the activity or the growth of some specific groups of bacteria, e.g. bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria. Scientific studies have proved that both prebiotics and probiotics have several beneficial effects on the host’s health, especially in terms of digestive and immune functions.\nAccording to the 2001 WHO/FAO definition, probiotics are “live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amount, confer a health benefit on the host”. They are commonly consumed as part of fermented food, e.g. yoghurt, or as dietary supplements.\nThe relationship established between two organisms that need each other to survive is called symbiosis. Bacteria have a long history of symbiotic interactions with humans, and they have even evolved in symbiosis with other microbes and with their hosts. Humans have trillions of bacteria living in their digestive tracts, and these bacteria have found a suitable ecosystem for their development. As they break down the food that humans can’t digest by themselves, they produce energy and the vitamins we need.\nSuperfood is a term attributed to a food or foods that confer health benefits based on the exceptional nutrient density of that food. Superfoods are rich in compounds such as antioxidants, fibre, fatty acids and phytonutrients, all considered beneficial for good health.', 'Did you know that your digestive system hosts more than 100 trillion bacteria? This is about 10 times more than the total number of cells that form your body. These bacteria – which are also called gut flora – perform a wide range of critical bodily functions. They are so important to our health that an imbalance has many negative consequences. Luckily you can take steps to optimize your digestive system’s microbiome. We’ll show you how in this article.\nHow Do You Know If Your Gut Is Not Happy?\nBefore we get into the nitty-gritty’s of a gut reset, you need to know the signs of an imbalance.\nAlso called dysbiosis, the imbalance of gut bacteria can cause a wide range of digestive problems. This includes:\nDysbiosis may lead to an array of digestive issues, including (6):\n- Stomach pain\n- Bloating, gas, and cramps after eating\n- Diarrhea or constipation (or both!)\nThese symptoms are common enough that they’re often mistaken for typical IBS symptoms. If you suffer from these chronically, there’s most likely an underlying cause.\nA healthy balance of gut bacteria is necessary for digestion. This means that if you’re experiencing digestive issues, consider working to reset your gut bacteria for better digestive health.\nHealthy gut microbiome may also play an important role in fertility.\nOne review highlighted the relationship between IBS and infertility, concluding that oxidative stress is a plausible mediator of that connection, although data is lacking to confirm that hypothesis (4).\nOne clinical trial found that administering probiotic supplements to men with idiopathic infertility improved sperm quality. The authors suggested that reducing oxidative stress in the seminal fluid was a possible reason for the improvement (23).\nSome scientists believe these microorganisms also regulate key hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and insulin (19). This may help explain why the microbiome has an impact on fertility. While these studies are interesting, they were small and more research needs to be done.\nMany autoimmune diseases involve an interplay between gut and immune system. It makes sense that the microbiome is closely linked to them as well.\nStudies show that those with Crohn’s disease tend to have low microbial diversity, an altered microbiome composition, and an unstable microbial community (1). That said, research is still new, and it’s unclear if this imbalance is a cause of these diseases or a symptom of it.\nHowever, some studies suggest autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and type 1 diabetes can be triggered or worsened by a poor microbiome (26).\nAllergies & Asthma\nOn the other hand, good bacteria help protect us from allergies and asthma.\nHealthy gut microbiome can reduce inflammation related to allergies & asthma which may explain the rise of these diseases in recent decades. One study found that people with allergies have fewer Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) bacteria (16).\nGiving this good bacteria to mice prevented them from developing allergies. It also reduced their immune system response, which is what causes allergic reactions in the first place (5).\nLGG has also been found in animal models to reduce inflammation and improve mucus production (16).\nFor example, Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus have been linked to reduced risk of colorectal cancer. This may be because they produce acetate, hydrogen peroxide, or other molecules that kill off tumor cells (21). However, the mechanisms and links are not well enough understood at this time to recommend a specific probiotic strain to help prevent or treat a specific disease. In fact, requirements and effects may be very individualized. What we can say is that a healthy gut microbiome contributes to a healthy gut.\nAs for other cancers, research is still limited.\nLow Energy And Chronic Fatigue\nDigestive problems can cause low energy and chronic fatigue. That’s because the gut microbiome is so involved in our metabolic function. It helps break down food nutrients, absorb them into the body, and release waste. When it’s unbalanced or unhealthy, you may not be able to absorb nutrients as well. This can leave you feeling fatigued and tired, even when you’re getting enough rest (11).\nAutoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto’s disease may also cause chronic fatigue or low energy. In fact, research shows that people with chronic fatigue sometimes have increased bacterial translocation (when bacteria passes from the intestines to the bloodstream) (24). This is a sign of leaky gut syndrome, which we’ll talk about below.\nAnxiety And Depression\nAbout 90% of serotonin – our “feel good hormone” – is created in the gut. That’s why imbalances in our microbiome can cause anxiety and depression.\nIt’s not exactly clear how this works. However, research suggests an unbalanced microbiome may interfere with serotonin production or the way the body uses it (14).\nThis is because serotonin needs “help” from other chemicals in order to function normally. When you have less gut bacteria, you may not produce enough of them or your body may not produce them in the right amount or at the right time. Either way, your brain chemistry will be thrown off, which can make you more anxious or depressed (14).\nBetterMe app is a foolproof way to go from zero to a weight loss hero in a safe and sustainable way! What are you waiting for? Start transforming your body now!\nHow Do You Reset Good Gut Bacteria?\nRestoring the gut microbiome takes time. But you can start with these 10 tips:\nEat More Fiber For Gut Reset\nFiber is an essential part of a balanced diet and is one of the best foods you can eat for a healthy gut. Adding fiber to your daily eating plan will help reset your gut microbiome by feeding beneficial bacteria and supporting optimal digestion.\nThere are two types of dietary fiber: Soluble and insoluble. Both play an important role in supporting overall health and wellness, but they do so in different ways.\nSoluble fiber is the type of dietary fiber that dissolves in water, forming a gel-like substance. The bacteria in your gut turn soluble fiber into short-chain fatty acids, namely acetate, propionate and butyrate. These are the preferred foods of the good bacteria that hang out in your colon (25).\nSoluble fiber is found in foods that are generally high in water content, such as fruits and vegetables. It can also be found in whole grains, oats, legumes, seeds and nuts.\nInsoluble fiber is not water-soluble. It passes through your intestines relatively intact, promoting regular bowel movements and supporting healthy gut bacteria (n). Foods that are high in insoluble fiber have a high-fiber content overall, including whole grains, vegetables and fruit.\nYou may be tempted to go “high” on the fiber scale right away by dramatically increasing your intake of foods such as leafy greens or cruciferous veggies (think cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower). You certainly can, but you should take it slow.\nFoods that are high in fiber have the potential to cause bloating and gas for those who aren’t used to eating them (27). If you experience these symptoms, consider adding a small amount of fiber daily until your digestive system adapts.\nIf you want to reset your gut microbiome with more fiber, try adding just one new fiber-rich food per week to your current diet.\nRestore Good Bacteria With Prebiotics And Probiotics\nPrebiotics are types of soluble fiber that act as “fertilizer” for the good bacteria in the gut. They help these beneficial bugs grow and multiply, ultimately helping you avoid digestive problems and promoting a healthy gut (25).\nProbiotics, on the other hand, are living strains of good bacteria that are found in certain foods or supplements.\nPrebiotics are found in foods rich in soluble fiber, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and some dairy products. You can also find prebiotic supplements at the local health food store or online.\nIf you want to reset your microbiome with more prebiotics, increase the number of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains you eat daily. You can also supplement your diet with prebiotic supplements.\nResearch shows that there’s a symbiotic relationship between prebiotics and probiotics (20). The two actually work together to help reset the gut microbiome, creating an environment where good bacteria thrive and flourish over bad bacteria. Combining these elements creates the best opportunity for your body to heal.\nEating prebiotics and probiotics together can be as simple as enjoying a cup of yogurt that contains live active cultures, along with fruit for added soluble fiber. While you’re at it, try adding in some berries rich in antioxidants to protect the good bacteria from the inside out.\nEat Fermented Foods\nFermented foods are high in live active cultures that “feed” bacteria in your gut, particularly the types of beneficial bacteria that create short-chain fatty acids. This is important because these acids are the optimum fuel for the cells lining your colon.\nThe process of fermentation breaks down foods naturally high in prebiotics, creating a food source for beneficial bacteria. These include fermented vegetables, miso, tempeh and kimchi. It also includes raw, unpasteurized sauerkraut that contains natural probiotics.\nIn addition to their prebiotic and probiotic content, fermented foods also contain additional nutrients that promote digestive balance and a healthy gut microbiome. These include calcium, magnesium and B vitamins.\nAnother way to reset your gut microbiome may be through fermented dairy products like kefir (a drinkable yogurt), yogurt and cheese.\nResearch shows that these foods contain additional probiotics – considered even more beneficial to gut health – and prebiotics, which help the good bacteria grow while crowding out the bad bacteria. Given their ability to boost lactobacilli populations, kefir and yogurt are linked to better digestive health while supporting a healthy gut microbiome (10).\nTry A Mediterranean Diet\nThe Mediterranean diet is high in fiber, vegetables, fruits and healthy fats. It’s also rich in protein from seafood, poultry and lean meats. What’s more, it contains fermented dairy products like yogurt alongside prebiotic foods such as garlic, onions, almonds and beans.\nPrevious research suggests that the gut microbiome of those who follow a Mediterranean diet is significantly different from those who don’t follow a Mediterranean style of eating. The differences include higher levels of healthy bacteria and less inflammation (17).\nThe easiest way to reset your gut microbiome through a Mediterranean-style diet is by eliminating processed foods. Replace packaged and prepackaged foods with whole, fresh foods that are high in fiber. It’s also important to eat a range of vegetables each day, at least two to three cups worth. Finally, choose whole grains instead of refined products whenever possible.\nEat More Anti Inflammatory Foods\nAcute inflammation in response to an illness or injury is a necessary and helpful part of the immune response. Chronic low-grade inflammation is a different story. Since chronic inflammation has been linked to digestive problems and other health conditions, it’s important to minimize it within the body as much as possible (13).\nTo reset your gut microbiome and potentially decrease those inflammatory markers, try:\n- Adding more fresh produce, especially those rich in anti-inflammatory nutrients like vitamins C and E and beta carotene\n- Replacing refined grain products with whole grains\n- Eating more foods rich in omega 3 fatty acids, such as salmon and other seafood\nIn addition to the health implications from eating a high-fat diet, stress can also have an adverse effect on gut bacteria (22). The reduction of beneficial bacteria levels in turn can create an imbalance in the gut microbiome.\nYou may want to try adding in activities that reduce stress like yoga, spending time outside or engaging in a relaxing activity like listening to music or taking a hot bath. It’s also important to consider making time for yourself each day and getting enough sleep. These are all effective ways of resetting your gut microbiome.\nIntense sweat sessions, working weight loss tips, lip-smacking recipes come in one package with the BetterMe app. And all of it is at your fingertips, start transforming your life now!\nMinimize Using Antibiotics If You Can\nAntibiotics are taken to kill bacteria that are causing infection and illness, but they can also have a negative impact on the gut microbiome by killing off beneficial bacteria (2).\nSometimes they are necessary, and you should always follow your doctor’s advice. But avoiding taking antibiotics unnecessarily is important.\nIf you can’t avoid taking antibiotics, talk to your doctor about taking them along with probiotic supplements. After your antibiotic course is finished, make sure to eat plenty of prebiotic foods that can help restore your good bacteria.\nAvoid Artificial Sweeteners\nIn a bid to lose weight and improve their health, many people are turning from sugar to artificial sweeteners. Unfortunately, research suggests that artificial sweeteners can also have a negative effect on the gut microbiome (8).\nTo reset your gut microbiome and improve your overall health, stay away from artificial sweeteners. You’d be better served by limiting sugar instead.\nIt’s also a good idea to limit your intake of high fructose corn syrup, which is often found in beverages and other products.\nDitch The Western Diet\nThe Western diet is high in animal protein, sugar, and fat, and low in fiber. This type of diet has been linked to an increased risk for developing health conditions like obesity, certain cancers and Alzheimer’s disease (15).\nReducing your intake of meat products, especially processed ones, is one way to reduce inflammation in the body and help reset the gut microbiome. Instead of eating ground beef or sausage or high-fat pork products, consider cooking with leaner poultry like chicken or turkey.\nAdditionally, replace your refined grain products with whole grains and add more vegetables to your diet. You might also want to experiment with different cooking methods like boiling or steaming instead of frying for a healthier meal plan overall.\nA study found that after quitting smoking, participants had more microbial diversity in their gut than when they were smoking (7).\nSmoking is harmful to the body in a number of ways, and it may be affecting your gut microbiome as well. Even if you can’t quit smoking altogether, consider cutting back to limit the potential damage smoking has on your gut microbiome.\nHit The Gym\nStudies suggest that exercise is good for your gut microbiome and overall health (9).\nWhen you work out, you tend to lower stress hormones, which are known to negatively impact the gut microbiome. If you haven’t been exercising regularly, then start slowly and build up. You’ll be able to reap the benefits of exercise on your gut microbiome before you know it.\nPractice Sleep Hygiene\nThe quality and quantity of your sleep is also linked to your gut microbiome. Unfortunately, too many people are sacrificing their sleep in order to get more things done.\nWith today’s busy lifestyle it can be hard to hit the hay at a decent hour, however this is having a negative impact on your gut microbiome. Studies suggest that getting enough sleep improves digestive health by resetting your gut microbiome (12).\nSome sleep hygiene practices that may help include:\n- Setting and sticking to a sleep schedule\n- Winding down before bed with relaxing activities like reading or taking a bath\n- Keeping sleep disruptions to a minimum by staying off electronics before bedtime and investing in blackout curtains\n- Creating a conducive sleep environment including temperature and comfortable beddings\n- Limiting alcohol and caffeine\nThe Bottom Line\nYour gut microbiome is responsible for regulating many processes in your body. Fortunately, there are plenty of steps you can take today to reset your gut microbiome and live a healthier life.

14	What preservation methods exist in Must Farm versus Gyomaendrőd?	The preservation conditions differ significantly between the sites. Must Farm's waterlogged environment in a fen preserved incredibly detailed artifacts including tools, housing, vitrified food in jars, textiles, wooden items, and even coprolites, making it comparable to Pompeii. In contrast, Gyomaendrőd's archaeological findings are primarily limited to villages, crockery from the Stone Age, and evidence of the Körös-civilization, with less detailed preservation of daily life artifacts.	"['Gyomaendrőd is a small and quiet town located in Békés County, South-East Hungary on the left bank of the Hármas-Körös River. Its climate is continental and the count of sunny hours is 2000 per year. This is very much the national average as only Szeged and its vicinity has more sunshine, around 2100 hours per year. The average rainfall is around 600 mm in a year. The town has an easy access by transport both on highways and railroad as route 46 trunk-road and route 4 Budapest – Szolnok – Békéscsaba – Lőkösháza long-distance railway pass through it.\nArcheological excavations clearly proved that this place has been populated for a very long time. Numerous villages and crockery from the Stone Age are found by archeologists gives the conclusion that there was an emerging civilization in this region. This seven thousand year old civilization is regarded as the aboriginal population of the area. Historians titled this civilization simply the Körös-civilization. The peoples of Körös-civilization may had had advanced agriculture and stock-farming techniques, yet they were bound to leave their domicile time to time as they depleted the land available for cultivating. They tilled the soil with rudimentary tools, didn’t fertilize and fallow it.\nThe once prosperous settlements of the area ceased to be exist by the late Stone Age almost entirely. New, more combative clans arrived in place of them and built earth lodges and tried to settle here thus started to create tools and apply a primitive rotation of crops. The Copper Age (2500 – 1900 BC) started to expand very slowly and never took a real shape generally. The Bronze Age had much more importance (1800 – 750 BC). The use of bronze items became widespread in the area and gave a huge momentum to the agricultural development. Besides the advancements in farming, trading gained a higher importance, as well. In this era ( 750 – 500 BC) are dated the first peoples regarded as ethnic groups: the Illyrians and the Thracians. These peoples couldn’t enjoy peace for long as from the east the Scythians appeared using iron arrows and they represented a more and more formidable threat. In this period more ethnic groups appeared in the region: first of all the Dacians and the Sarmatian clans but even The Celts took their visit here. During the transmigration they were followed by the Huns, the Avars and the Pechenegs. The many peoples and remnants of peoples living here started to form a unit and they strived to live peacefully besides each other. This aspiration gained a huge impetus from the Hungarian conquest in 896 AD. The occupation of the Carpathian Basin took 100-150 years and the peoples already settled here proved to be willing to live together with the Hungarians and later melted into the Hungarian nation.\nThe history of Gyoma\nAlthough since January 1st 1982 we speak of Gyomaendrőd, it is worth surveying the history of the two settlements separately as there are huge differences both as regards religion and economics.\nThe history behind the name “Gyoma” has two known explanations. According to the first theory “Gyoma” means mouth, influx as the village was built not too far from the River Körös’s confluence. According to another explanation “Gyoma” was a personal name and probably the first owner of the settlement was called Gyoma. Comparing these two conceptions probably the latter is valid since the junction of the rivers is to be found 12 km from Gyoma and at the time of Hungarian conquest and in the ensuing times usually the villages got their names after their owners. Authentic sources mention it for the first time in 1332 as “Gama” then in 1444 already as “Gyoma”. Based upon our today’s knowledge Gyoma’s first owners were the Iktári Bethlens. Due to chronic financial problems the settlement first was impawned many times and its proprietors were changing frequently. Thus may had happened that from the ownership of the Bethlen family the village got into the hands of the Neczpáli family then during the conflicts with the Turks the Dóczys on Ferdinand’s part acquired it.\nThe Ottomans were blockading the Castle of Gyula in 1534 and eventually seized it thus signing the doom of the region. During the time of Ottoman occupation the history of Gyoma wasn’t very different from the fate of many other settlements on the Great Plain. Its population had been decreasing continuously and eventually almost entirely became depopulated. This is founded by the fact that it wasn’t even registered in the assessment of lists in 1564.\nAfter the expulsion of the Turks and Rákóczi’s War for Independence Hungary was ruled by the Habsburgs. The imperials gave the land to Baron János György Harruckern. Harrcukern had an important role not only in the resettlement of Gyoma and Endrőd but in Békés and Békéscsaba, as well. He offered various privileges for the settlers though he looked to it that people belonging to the same denomination settle in the same village. Due to this the populace of Gyoma is mainly still Reformed while Endrőd is mostly Catholic.\nThe year of 1830 is another important date in the history of Gyoma as the settlement attained the rank of a market-town and this is the year when Tamás Csepcsányi populates the town with Germans. After the resettlement the development of Gyoma was continous. By the mid-1800s it already had a kindergarten, a school and a brick church. The progression wasn’t even stopped by the The Hungarian Revolution and War of Independence (1848-49, which the town supported as much as it could. Following the abolition of serfdom the land got into the hands of smallholders and medium holders and farming gained ground.\nRegarding Gyoma’s industry basically it was handicraft, small-scale industry. The main employers were the flour-mills, the Ailer Brickworks and the Kner Printing House. The Kner Printing House through the leadership of Izidor Kner and his son Imre Kner obtained world fame and gave a huge impetus to the development of Gyoma as it reformed printing.\nThe 1800s was the age of huge building constructions in Gyoma. From 1858 the town already had the railroad and railway station then a bridge was erescted across the River Körös that intensely integrated the town into the region’s economy.\nThe Körös River continually caused huge troubles with its frequent floods and due to this arose the possibility of the regulation of the River Körös but the work gained a real momentum only from the great floods of 1844-1845. The regulation was realized in the spirit of István Széchenyi by Mátyás Huszár and Pál Vásárhelyi. It gave an incredible dynamism to the region as this was the costliest and hugest project of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. The unemployment practically ceased to exist in this territory and though the building works had gone on for a long time, by 1895 the dikes were finished and interconnected. Thus the Körös River was “steadied down.”\nThe First and the Second World War meant huge casualties for the town but fortunately didn’t cause permanent damages in the infrastructure. The Soviet occupation after 1945 was crucial in Gyoma’s history. In the agriculture the former world of independent farms started to get deteriorated after two collective farms had been established by the leadership. These were the Győzelem (Victory) and Alkotmány (Constitution) co-operative farms. Around this time the town attained its current face. The Liget Thermal Bath was built in 1954. In 1949 a municipal library was built then in 1967 the Gábor Bethlen Vocational School of Agriculture was reinstituted. In 1970 the Kner Printing House set up a printing museum. The Change of Regime changed theagriculture first of all as the co-operative farms were dissolved and the land was privately owned again. Nowadays a lot of small parcels are cultivated.\nThe progression and development is continuous as there are always new building constructions in town: the bridges undergo renovation and the thermal bath is getting expanded. By joining the European Union Gyoma may get access to new financial sources through tendering and this way it can reestablish its position and further increasing its incessant development.\nThe history of Endrőd\nEndrőd is located to the west from Gyoma on the left bank of the Körös River, as well. Its past has a strong resemblance to Gyoma’s. It was named probably after its owner or inhabitant called Endre. The name Endrőd is mentioned for the first time in a charter from 1416. The village must had been developing intensely since in 1425 it was already referred to as a significant settlement where 33 family of noble birth was living. After the fall of the Gyula Castle the population of Endrőd was likewise decimated then almost entirely outmigrated like it happened in the case of Gyoma. The recolonization started at he beginning of the 1700s and similarly to Gyoma it was accomplished by János György Harruckern, also. Basically Catholics settled down here and this was characteristic later, too - the biggest divide between Gyoma and Endrőd till our days. Faithfully to the catholic traditions the families in Endrőd had 6-8 children but it wasn’t rare to have 10 children. The consequence of the demographic explosion at the beginning of the 19th century enhanced Endrőd to be the most populated village of the region. The steep expansion of its population was favorable for farming agriculture. The number of its inhabitants reached 16000 by the 1930s and more than half of the people lived in farms and cultivated land, raising stock. However land was finite and the increasing population bore an ever growing unemployment. Many started to work as day-laborers and diggers or went to the neighboring Gyoma in the hope of getting sharecrop. Although the regulation of the Körös River decreased unemployment, after completing (1895) the task discontentment was on the rise and it caused outmigration and finally led to the famous volley firing by the gendarmes of Endrőd in 1935. For the memory of the eight casualties of the volley firing eight stone coffins were laid on the main square of Endrőd that is still there.\nThe economy of Endrőd was based on agriculture but besides this fact it’s important not to forget the small-scale industry serving it. Many famous coachmen, boot maker, smith craftsmen lived and worked here.\nRegarding the culture at the beginning of the 1900s there were 11 reading circles in the web of farms; Endrőd had a journeyman school, vocational school of agriculture and grammar-school. Its healthcare system was more advanced than its neighbors - including Gyoma – since it had a maternity home, a poorhouse, an isolation hospital and three pharmacies. Endrőd was among the firsts in the county to open a cinema hall and by the beginning of the 20th century it already had a petrol station.\nThe two world wars – their memorial is to be found at Endrőd’s main square – caused serious casualties in the ranks of its population then the Soviet occupation in 1945 and later the socialist regime changed the scenery of Endrőd, the county and the whole Great Plain equally. The flourishing world of private farms gave its place to the co-operative farms. In Endrőd two large co-operatives were established: the Lenin and the Béke (Peace) co-operative farms. The collective farms attracted many while others left the region. Many moved to the west, others emigrated abroad, chiefly to the United States.\nAs a result of the socialist industrial development the Enci Shoemaking Company opened its gates in 1949 and soon became famous both in Hungary and abroad with its high quality products. Nowadays the only thing remained is the fame of the once renowned shoemakers since they couldn’t compete anymore with the multinationals and the cheap shoes manufactured in China. Unfortunately due to the limited opportunities the population of Endrőd is still decreasing as the youth tend to leave after finishing school locally. The village that had 16000 inhabitants in the 1930s has only about 6000 people nowadays.', ""Must Farm: Britain's Pompeii Reveals Burning Bronze Age Secrets\nDubbed ‘Britain’s Pompeii,’ Must Farm is an amazingly well-preserved Bronze Age site in Cambridgeshire, England. The 3,000-year-old site has made international archaeology news headlines time and again for fantastic discoveries. Tools, housing, and even vitrified food have all been impeccably preserved at the waterlogged site. Now, archaeologists have made another startling discovery – the Bronze Age settlement was only inhabited for about a year before it fell in a catastrophic fire.\nMeet Must Farm, A Bronze Age Time Capsule\nMust Farm is located in a fen (wetland) and its houses are said to be the ‘most completely preserved prehistoric domestic structures found in Britain.’ Lead archaeologist of the Cambridge Archaeological Unit, Mark Knight, provided Ancient Origins with an insight into how thrilling it is excavating at Must Farm :\n“Working at the site was a series of daily, almost hourly moments of astonishment and wonder (with each new discovery seemingly outshining the last). This was invariably accompanied by a faint rotten-egg smell that goes with most waterlogged sites - the smell of gradual organic decay.”\n- Bronze Age Wooden Wheel Adds to List of Surprising Finds at Must Farm\n- Burned 3,000-Year-Old Settlement Frozen in Time May Have Been Torched by Raiding Party\n- Excavations at British sites are Revolutionizing Prehistoric Studies and Revealing Secrets of the Past\nExcavation of the Must Farm pile-dwelling settlement, showing the main body of the collapsed settlement (looking east) in its river silt matrix. (D. Webb)\nHe also discussed the “uncontaminated simplicity of the settlement record – built, occupied, burnt down” and how that has helped the researchers reconstruct what life was like circa 850 BC. As Knight mentions, there are numerous finds that have been made at Must Farm since the first discoveries of a rapier and sword there in 1969. Ancient Origins has also reported on previous finds such as vitrified food found in jars , household and personal items such as textiles and jewelry , and a wooden wheel .\nCombined with other discoveries, the archaeologists at Must Farm have an almost unrivalled peek into what Knight calls “daily practice, architecture and the consumption of material culture” when people lived in the stilted roundhouse dwellings elevated over a river so long ago.\nThe Sudden Abandonment of the Bronze Age Settlement\nArchaeologists are certain that the Bronze Age settlement at Must Farm was destroyed by a catastrophic fire . Knight told Ancient Origins, “There are many hypotheses about what caused the fire (whether it was deliberate or an accident) – currently our fire investigator suggests that the origin of the fire was internal.” Previous reports have suggested that the settlement may have been torched by a raiding party.\nThe press release for the article in Antiquity states that the fire was “A tragedy for the inhabitants, but lucky for archaeologists, as the fluvial silts have preserved ‘wooden artefacts, pottery sets, bronze tools and weapons, fabrics and fibres , querns, loom weights, spindle whorls, animal remains, plants and seeds, coprolites…”\nExcavation methodology—scaffold platform above structure 1. (D. Webb)\nKnight told Ancient Origins that it is estimated between 50 to 80 people may have been inhabiting the site when it burned. However, the only evidence of human remains found at Must Farm to date amount to the following: “A few pieces of human bone were found in around the footprints of the structures (one skull, two skull fragments, a tooth and lumber vertebra; representing a minimum of two individuals).”\nBut it seems these were unrelated to the fire because, as Knight explained, “The majority were unburnt and associated with occupation deposits. Precedent suggests it was common at the end of the Bronze Age for parts of skeletons to be deposited in and around habitation sites (ancestors shared the same spaces as the living). Formal burial grounds are all but absent at this time in prehistory.”\n- Bronze Age time capsule: 3,000-year-old vitrified food found in jars in England\n- Houses from 3,000 Years Ago Are Among Best-Preserved of the Era in Britain\n- Kungagraven – A Grave Fit for a Nordic Bronze Age King, But Who Was Buried Inside?\nJust One Year of Life at Must Farm’s Settlement\nAccording to the press release, Knight and his colleagues provide the first “definitive timeframe to Must Farm’s occupation and destruction” in their journal article.

15	How do the Japanese naval losses at Pearl Harbor compare to their losses at the Battle of Midway in terms of ships and personnel?	At Pearl Harbor, Japan's losses were minimal, with only 29 aircraft, five midget submarines, and 64 personnel killed, with one prisoner taken. In contrast, the Battle of Midway six months later resulted in much heavier Japanese losses, including three sunk aircraft carriers, three battleships, three transports, four cruisers, and several planes. The Battle of Midway's losses, combined with other recent Pacific battle casualties, dealt a significant blow to Japan's navy, making it difficult for them to concentrate their forces for future attacks despite still maintaining a larger naval force than the U.S.	['Six months after Japan’s brutal attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. Navy has defeated the Japanese fleet at Midway Island in the Pacific. The battle started on June 4 and lasted four days, after which the U.S. was able to claim victory.\nOnly limited details of the battle are available at this time, however it has been confirmed that three Japanese aircraft carriers have been sunk; another two carriers were reported damaged. Japan also lost three battleships, three transports, four cruisers and several planes. These naval casualties, taken together with the losses Japan has suffered in other recent battles (in the Coral Sea and elsewhere in the Pacific), mean the Japanese navy has taken a hard hit.\nA German Transocean broadcast recorded a Tokyo newspaper stating: “One cannot always expect victories, but must also be able to stand losses. The Japanese Commander in Chief… received the news of the loss of two of his vessels quite calmly. Every leader of a great fleet must show similar calm.”\nEven with the recent destruction of various warships and planes, the Japanese still have a larger naval force than the U.S. However, with more territory to cover and fewer vessels available, it would be nearly impossible for Japan to concentrate the entirety of its navy on a single, concentrated attack against the Allies. This helps put the U.S. in a much stronger position.\nThis battle is being viewed (and celebrated) as the first great victory for the Allies since the U.S. entered the war in December 1941. What makes the battle even more significant is that it took place relatively close to Pearl Harbor, and culminated on the six-month anniversary of the surprise attack by the Japanese on the U.S. Since that day at Pearl Harbor, many Americans have been waiting for the chance to strike back – and the victory at Midway proved to be the retribution the country needed.\n“A momentous victory is in the making,” said Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, commander of the United States Pacific Fleet. “Pearl Harbor has now been partially avenged.”\nAfter the recent string of Allied losses, a big win is exactly what was needed to raise morale – for those actively involved in the war and those watching (and waiting) desperately from the sidelines. The U.S. citizens at home finally get to see their country hit back and succeed after months of defeat.\nIt will take the Japanese months, if not longer, to replace all the ships and planes lost in the battle at Midway Island. Perhaps equally important, this battle proves that Japan is not invincible—this American victory in the Pacific may very well be a turning point in the Second World War.\n“A MOMENTOUS VICTORY.” (1942, June 8).

Four of the American battleships were blown up, or sank where they lay at anchor. Four further battleships were damaged and eleven other warships sunk or disabled.\n…..As well as striking at the American warships, the Japanese attackers struck at Pearl Harbor’s airfields; 188 American aircraft were destroyed on the ground, 2,330 Americans were dead or dying, 1,177 of them killed on the battleship Arizona. When Roosevelt informed Churchill, in secret, of the full extent of the casualties, explaining that these were considerably more than that given to the Press, Churchill’s comment was ‘What a holocaust!’\n…..The Japanese had lost twenty-nine aircraft and five midget submarines in th attack; sixty-four of their men were dead, and one, Ensign Kazua Sakamaki, whose midget submarine had run aground on the island, was taken prisoner; the first Japanese prisoner of the Second World War. As the scale of the American losses became known, the shock in the United Sates was considerable; of the nine American battleships capable of offensive or defensive action in the Pacific earlier that morning, only two remained able to enter combat. Japan’s ten battleships were masters of the Pacific.\n….There had been many acts of heroism, however, among the surprised American defenders, at Kaneohe naval base, Chief Aviation Ordananceman John Finn had been lying in bed when the Japanese attack began. Hurrying to the airbase he managed to set up a machine gun near one of the hangars and, under heavy Japanese fire, began to fire back. ‘Although painfully wounded many times’, his Medal of Honor citation records,’he continued to man his gun and to return the enemy’s fire vigorously, and with telling effect throughout the enemy strafing and bombing attacks, and with complete disregard for his own personal safety.’\n…..The attack on Pearl Harbor coincided with the planned attacks on three other American Pacific islands, Guam, Wake and Midway, each of which was bombed or shelled that day, and its airfields damaged. That same morning, across the South China Sea, the Japanese Second Fleet escorted a convoy of troop transports bringing 24,00-0 troops from Indo-China to the Malayan Peninsula. At the same time, at Singapore, Japanese air attacks led to the death of sixty-one civilians, while at Hong Kong, Japanese war planes destroyed all but one of the eight British aircraft lined up on the tarmac of Kai-Tak airport.\n…..It was towards midnight on December 7, Central European time, that Hitler, at his headquarters at Rastenburg, in East Prussia, learned of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. ‘Now it is impossible for us to lose the war, he told Walther Hewel, and he went on to explain: ‘We now have an ally who has never been vanquished in three thousand years.’\nADDENDUM: Here is my post from last year, with a video from December 7, and one Arizona survivor’s story.']	['<urn:uuid:0a697412-a3c0-4109-9d04-9d40660b9787>', '<urn:uuid:84ec0e33-728c-4cf7-a4d0-29ab2bf12dba>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	24	92	1072
16	How did Jersey City's political machine ensure large attendance numbers for baseball opening days at Roosevelt Stadium?	Jersey City's Hague political machine, which had run the city since 1917, required every municipal employee to purchase a ticket to opening day games. This practice helped Jersey City achieve the largest opening day crowds in the International League. For example, on the day of Jackie Robinson's debut, while 25,000 fans actually attended the game, twice that number of tickets were sold, ensuring Jersey City led the league in attendance that day.	"[""Thursday, April 18, 2013\n149. Jackie Robinson: A Great Day in Jersey City\nToday's post is a re-working of one of my oldest ones on the site. While I liked the original drawing, times change and my style has evolved a bit so when I wanted to include Jackie in my new edition of 21, I decided it was time to give him an update. Since Robinson's first appearance in 1946 was such a momentous occasion, and being from New Jersey, I wanted to show a bit of the old ballpark in Jersey City where the game took place. That's Roosevelt Stadium's distinctive scoreboard in the background. I liked this drawing so much I made it a full-page illustration in 21. I tried to depict Robinson as being full of confidence, ready to take the field for the first time, the weight of a whole race upon his able shoulders. It was an important day and I wanted to make this an important drawing.\n67 years ago today, Jackie Robinson sat in the visitor's locker room of Jersey City's Roosevelt Stadium. Suiting up with his Montréal Royals teammates, Robinson was about to do what no black man had done since 1899 - play in an organized baseball game. Johnny Wright, another black ballplayer was on the roster that day, too, but Wright was a pitcher and was not going to play. Once the bands stopped and Mayor Hague threw out the first ball, Robinson was on his own. Opening Day in Jersey City was a big deal back then, a city-wide holiday. The Hague political machine that ran the city since 1917 expected every single municipal employee to purchase a ticket in order to give Jersey City the largest opening day crowd every year. Although 25,000 fans streamed through the turnstiles that afternoon, twice than number was sold. Still, with 25,000, Jersey City easily led the International League in attendance that day, and they got to witness history being made.\nFrom the story accompanying the illustration in 21:\nWhen Jackie Robinson took the field at Jersey City’s Roosevelt Stadium on April 18, 1946 he became the first black ballplayer in organized baseball since 1899. Robinson’s fame as a college athlete, his university education, and experience as an army officer made him the perfect man for a very difficult job. Many Negro League ballplayers expressed disappointment that he was to be the first to integrate the game. His manager with Montréal silently questioned whether or not a black man was even human. Bob Feller, who pitched against Robinson in 1945, thought so little of his talent said “If he were a white man, I doubt if they would even consider him big league material, except perhaps as a bat boy.” Robinson faced it all with quiet dignity and strength. In that first game in Jersey City he went 4 for 5, including a three-run homer, scored 4 runs, drove in 3 and stole 2 bases. Overcoming immense racial pressure, Jackie won over his teammates and fans with his natural physical ability and intense drive to win. Sparked by his play, Montréal won the Little World Series of 1946 and the next year he was playing for Brooklyn. Through his sheer determination Jackie Robinson not only paved the way for the desegregation of the major leagues but also the modern civil rights movement.\nDon't forget the card I posted yesterday of Happy Chandler, the Commissioner of Baseball who backed up Branch Rickey when he wanted to bring Jackie Robinson to the Dodgers.""]"	['<urn:uuid:31359cb7-3c6f-4807-ab36-dd3ac76e6e50>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	17	72	590
17	I'm helping out at my local community center and noticed some boxes stored near the emergency exit - what kinds of things are we not allowed to keep in the areas around fire exits?	Fire exit routes must be kept clear at all times. Items not allowed in these areas include: portable heating equipment (including electric heaters), anything with a naked flame like candles and lamps, cooking equipment (including tea urns and kettles), bins and rubbish bags, stored items such as clothes for charity shops, and notice boards (unless small with firmly pinned notices).	"[""Should there be an outbreak of fire, it is essential that people can safety and quickly evacuate the building without being put at any risk. Fire exit routes need to lead as directly to a place of safety as possible and must be marked with exit signs.\nThe exact numbers of fire exits needed in any building depends on a number of factors, including the number of people who could potentially use the exit. Churches and Places of Worship that have recently been refurbished or built will comply with the current Building Regulations so the number and size of the fire exits should be adequate in these situations. In older premises, the exits will need further assessment to ensure the exits are large enough and well distributed.\nIn most Churches and Places of Worship, the time taken to evacuate the building should be about 2 minutes 30 seconds, with consideration being made to the time it takes for people to respond to a fire alarm.\nThis time can be increased by up to 30 seconds for new buildings that comply with the latest Building Regulations, or reduced as much as necessary for a high fire risk building, such as those predominantly built from wood, where the risk to life due to fire is much higher than average.\nNumbers and size of exits\nA typical single-width exit door (750mm wide) will allow about 40 people per minute to evacuate. Larger doors will typically allow more people to pass through, so a 1050mm door width can allow as many as 80 people to evacuate per minute.\nHowever, when calculating how many exits are required, it is usually assumed that the largest exit route is unavailable because it is blocked by fire. If more than one exit discharges into the same place (for example, a lobby), then consider the aggregate loss of exit capacity caused by a fire in the lobby.\nIt is often the case that the number of fire exits limits the number of people that can safely use a building although other factors can have an impact. In some cases, the number of seats is the deciding factor as to the capacity of a room or building. In others, it is more down to the practicalities of the number of people being in the room.\nIt is commonly accepted that one exit is adequate in buildings where no more than 60 people congregate, providing that the building is on ground floor level only. However, it is always recommended that more than one fire exit is available so there is always another way out if the main entrance is blocked by fire. Furthermore, many rooms of low occupancy with low fire risk need only one exit.\nThe fire exits should be distributed around the building so ensuring that people can reach a safe exit route. Ideally the two exit routes would go in opposite directions, but at the least they should be positioned so that they are far enough apart so that a fire blocking one of the doors will not block the other. In looking at the direction of the exits, also consider any furniture or obstacles that could prevent people taking a direct path to an exit.\nIn some buildings, inward opening, rotating or sliding doors are installed at main entrances. None of these types of door are usually acceptable as emergency exit doors so they might need to be fixed open using a latch or chain if the door is needed as an exit route. Note that windows and ladders are not acceptable for use as fire exits in Churches and Places of Worship because the public cannot be expected to use these in an emergency.\nAn additional assessment is needed to determine if the position of exits with a building is adequate. This is to look at the travel distances. This is the distance that a person needs to move to reach the final exit from the building, or to a storey exit within a fire protected staircase. Consideration must be given to furniture and building features that might make the travel distance longer as people move around these objects.\nA number of travel distances have been published in government guidance, and for a typical Church or Place of Worship with normal fire risks, the following would usually apply as recommendations:\n- 32 metres in areas with seating in rows where more than one exit is provided\n- 15 metres in areas with seating in rows where there is only one exit\n- 45 metres in all other areas where more than one exit is provided\n- 18 metres in all other areas where there is only one exit\nThe seating plan can also play a significant role in the safe evacuation of people. The layout should ensure people can access a safe aisle or circulation space readily.\nIdeally, seating should be secured to the floor so that seats do not move or fall over. If seating is not secured to the floor, rows should usually be no longer than 12 seats and the seats should be secured together. No fewer than four seats should be secured together otherwise the seats could be tipped over easily and block someone's exit route.\nWhere stand-alone seating is used, the layout should allow for the inevitable rearrangement of seating by people in the congregation, and enough seats should be put out to prevent people adding seats to the end of rows and in aisles which could block the exit route.\nSeating plans need to allow free and ready access to exit routes (including aisles) and allowance needs to be made for wheelchair users so that they do not need to use aisle space. Aisles should be at least 1.05 metres wide along the entire length. Seats should allow for a clear seatway of 305mm (the distance between the back of one seat to the closest part of the one behind is the seatway) to allow space for people to move along a row of seats.\nDoor locks and security\nFor the final exit door from the building, it would be usual to use panic locks (of the 'push bar to open' kind). Such doors must be opened quickly in an emergency as people might panic as they evacuate the burning building, so additional locks or mechanisms must not be fitted.\nIt must be remembered that the door should be capable of being opened by any person immediately in an emergency. Some kinds of locks and latches used on doors may be unsuitable for use by everyone - some people may not be able to operate certain kinds of lever, knob or handle due to dexterity problems.\nSome doors might be secured by locks and keys. It considered unacceptable to have a key available nearby or in a red 'break glass' key box to open a fire exit door. Instead, a thumb-turn should be fitted to the inside of such doors to allow the door to be unlocked quickly by anyone.\nAll exit doors should not be locked when the public is present and checks should be made beforehand that this is the case unless the doors have simple lock mechanisms, like a panic bar. Members of the public should expect to have to operate one simple, unambiguous and ideally labelled device to open a door in an emergency.\nElectronic locking systems are becoming more popular. These must be fitted with suitable 'emergency door release' call points (break glass units), green in colour, and positioned so the door can be unlocked if the exit is needed. These locking mechanisms should ideally be connected to the fire alarm system, if there is one present, to ensure that the doors unlock automatically and remain unlocked until reset manually whenever the fire alarm is activated.\nUnwanted use of exit doors\nUnofficial and unwanted use of fire exit doors can be a problem in some premises. It might be that people could be looking for a short cut, or want some extra ventilation in hot weather, but the use of fire exit doors can lead to other safety and security implications, not least the safety of children.\nThere are a number of ways in which the use of fire exit doors can be controlled. Breakable straps are available that seal around the panic bar, or can be looped through screwed eyelet fixings. These seals break at about 10 to 12kg force, so will break when the door is opened for legitimate reasons. Note that cable ties and other non-breakable or home-made securing methods must not be used as these will prevent people using the exit door.\nAlarms can be a useful deterrent to unwanted fire exit use. The simplest is a stick-on alarm available for a few pounds from most hardware stores. The disadvantage of these is that many models are very loud and can be turned off by a small switch on the side. However, a number of manufacturers produce specific fire exit alarms that cost more but have the advantage of having a key or code number to limit who can arm or disarm the alarm.\nInward Opening doors\nTo ensure people can evacuate the premises quickly, exit doors should open in the direction of travel.\nIn some situations, including many older / historic Parish Church buildings, the doors open inwards. While this might be acceptable for Places of Worship where only a small number congregate (60 or fewer people), it is unlikely this would be acceptable otherwise.\nIn some cases, the door can be secured open with a cabin hook, or more securely with a padlock and key to prevent unauthorised closing (which can happen in cold weather). Where this is not practical, the door can be supervised by a steward or a nominated person (such as a fire Marshal) who will have to open and secure the door in the event of a fire. Any person given this role should sit close to the door at all times and cover should be arranged for holidays etc...\nFire exit routes must be kept clear at all times.\nThere are 'rules' about what you cannot have in these areas because they might hamper evacuation. The list includes:\nPortable heating equipment (including electric heaters)\nAnything that has a naked flame, including candles and lamps\nCooking equipment (including tea urns and kettles)\nBins and rubbish bags\nStored items, such as clothes for a charity shop or bring-and-buy sale\nNotice boards (unless small and the notices are kept firmly pinned onto the board)\nIt might be acceptable to have a coat rack in the escape route as long as it does not reduce the width of the exit significantly. Fire retardant furniture might be acceptable, again providing that there is no reduction in the escape route width and consideration is given to the fact that people will often move the furniture about and this could block the exit route.\nBe mindful of the fact that people who are trying to leave a smoke-filled room will often use the walls as a guide, so obstructions on, or close to, a wall are not desirable. This includes objects that are installed close to head-height that might not be seen.\nIn the event of fire, smoke can quickly make visibility poor. Exits need to be well lit by normal mains lighting, which should be switched on whenever the building is in use. In many situations, emergency lighting might be necessary both inside the building and directly outside the final exit doors. Such lighting would be designed to provide enough light to find an exit in safety.\nExits for people with disabilities\nCurrent Equality legislation requires a provision of suitable fire exits for disabled people. In some buildings, it might be possible to have a number of dedicated exit routes for people with impaired mobility where the normal fire exits are not suitable. In situations where exit routes need to be marked as suitable for wheelchair users, special exit signs are available which show a wheelchair symbol next to the usual fire exit symbols, arrow and text.\nIn some larger buildings (on more than one storey level), it might be necessary to provide 'refuge points' for disabled or elderly people to wait for assistance. This is necessary because most lifts cannot be used in the event of fire as people might be put in greater danger if the lift doors open onto the fire itself. Refuge areas usually need to have some form of intercom or communications system and must be protected against fire by means of fire doors.\nIn any case, you should have a procedure in place to enable the safe evacuation of all people from the building. This includes those that might have impaired hearing, mobility, sight or perception. For regular attenders, employees and volunteers, consider setting up a personal emergency evacuation plan (PEEP), where a detailed plan is laid down for each person, highlighting who will provide assistance and what assistance is needed. Generic Emergency Evacuation Plans (GEEPs) can be beneficial for visitors.\nFire and Emergency Assembly Point\nA Fire Assembly Point is a place of safety where people meet if there is a fire or similar emergency. This needs to be away from the building, and the normal recommendation is for it to be a distance equal to twice the height of the building. The assembly point must be large enough to accommodate all the people that might be present and located so that people do not get in the way of the emergency services.\nIt is also wise to have a second assembly point available. If the main assembly point is being affected by a fire, people can be moved to a further place of safety. Additionally to this, if the emergency is during bad weather, arrangements should be made to accommodate people in a nearby building so they are not affected by the weather.\nBecause of the complexities of fire exit calculation, the above is only an overview. More information on exits and means of escape can be found in the guidance to the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005. These guides are intended for England and Wales. The guide for Small and Medium Places of Assembly is suitable for most Churches and Places of Worship of small or moderate size.\nIf there is any doubt as to the suitability of exit routes, it is recommended that a competent person conducts a Fire Risk Assessment to determine if the size and distribution of exits, and the travel distance, is acceptable.""]"	['<urn:uuid:206ad08d-6f14-495a-9afa-7eea73cd2cb3>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	34	60	2427
18	forest products industry environmental improvements since 2000	AF&PA member companies have made significant environmental improvements since 2000, including a 23 percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and 42 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide (SO2) from pulp and paper facilities. Additionally, they have reduced their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity by over 23 percent since 2000, and have committed to a further reduction of at least 15 percent by 2020 from a 2005 baseline.	"[""AF&PA on the Issues\nOur industry employs about 900,000 men and women and is built on principles of sustainability: producing recyclable products from a renewable resource. Forest products companies are among the top 10 manufacturing sector employers in 47 states. American Forest & Paper Association (AF&PA) members manufacture and provide essential products used daily by people across the country and around the world — products that play an important role in literacy, education, hygiene, food safety, product marketing and protection, and home and office construction. We support market-based policies and regulations that foster economic growth, job creation, and international competitiveness in this vital sector. We believe public policies are most effective when they meet the economic needs, environmental concerns, and societal expectations of our diverse communities.\nAF&PA member companies have invested billions of dollars as part of its environmental stewardship, including a 23 percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and 42 percent for sulfur dioxide (SO2) by our pulp and paper facilities since 2000. Despite this investment, the industry faces challenges from new and existing regulations — driven by lawsuits under the Clean Air Act — that together could impose more than $10 billion in new capital obligations on the industry over the next 10 years. The cumulative burden being imposed on business is unsustainable.\nBiomass for Renewable Energy\nThe forest products industry is the nation’s leading producer and user of carbon-neutral, renewable biomass energy. AF&PA believes market forces, not government mandates and incentives, should determine the use of wood and wood residuals for renewable energy. Government policies that pick winners and losers by mandating a particular use for a raw material or fuel are misguided and should be avoided. Woody biomass is an essential raw material for value-added forest products, such as paper, packaging, wood products, wood-based chemicals, and other innovative products. On average, about two-thirds of our industry’s total energy demand is met through carbon-neutral biomass, and some of our renewable electricity is sold to the grid. This process is among the most efficient in the world, using materials that would otherwise be waste to create both thermal and electrical energy, commonly referred to as combined heat and power (or cogeneration) technology.\nStudies show that per ton of wood used, the paper and wood products manufacturing industry sustains nine times as many total jobs as the biomass energy sector. Accordingly, it is important for federal renewable energy policies should not require forest products manufacturing facilities to compete on an uneven playing field with their power suppliers and other energy producers for biomass fiber.\nCarbon Neutrality of Biomass Energy\nPaper and wood products mills use biomass residuals from their manufacturing operations to produce bioenergy that provides significant carbon reducing benefits to the environment. AF&PA urges policymakers to clearly recognize our industry’s use of biomass for energy as carbon neutral. EPA’s revised framework to account for biogenic carbon does not provide the certainty needed that the bioenergy we produce and use is carbon neutral.\nAs forests grow, trees remove CO2 from the atmosphere via photosynthesis. Trees release the stored carbon when they die, decay, or are combusted, thus completing the carbon cycle. The use of biomass in the paper and wood products manufacturing industry provides enormous greenhouse gas reduction benefits by avoiding the emission of about 181 million metric tons of CO2e. This is equivalent to removing about 35 million cars from the road.\nUnder EPA’s current and proposed greenhouse gas regulations, biogenic CO2 emissions are counted the same as fossil fuel emissions. On Nov. 19, 2014, after an extensive four-year review, EPA issued its revised draft Framework for Assessing Biogenic CO2 Emissions from Stationary Sources and a related policy memorandum. In the memorandum, EPA makes a preliminary finding that the use of certain forest-derived industrial byproducts for energy is carbon neutral. In the framework appendices, EPA unequivocally finds that black liquor is carbon neutral. While EPA recognizes that there are carbon benefits from using other manufacturing residuals for energy, the forest products industry needs greater certainty for all of our forest products manufacturing residuals and detailed information about how EPA will determine what is “sustainably-derived” forest biomass.\nOur industry is a leader in the use of renewable energy and highly-efficient combined heat and power (CHP), or cogeneration. Even so, purchased energy remains a major manufacturing cost for the forest and paper industry.\nEPA’s greenhouse gas (GHG) regulation of existing electric utilities under the Clean Power Plan (CPP) will increase energy costs, decrease the reliability of the electric system, and set adverse precedent for potential GHG regulation of our industry. As the nation confronts the challenge of upgrading its electrical transmission infrastructure, care must be taken to ensure that upgrades are based on sound economic analysis and that their costs are paid for in a fair and equitable manner.\nAF&PA is pleased that the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the CPP rule pending resolution of claims that EPA exceeded its legal authority in the way in which the rule is crafted.\nAF&PA members have reduced their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity by over 23 percent since 2000. Beyond what the industry has already achieved, we have committed to a reduction of at least 15 percent by 2020 from a 2005 baseline.\nThe final adopted Clean Power Plan and model rules should provide for least-costly implementation possible to ratepayers and the economy, including recognizing the climate benefits of biomass energy. Our industry’s products and how we produce and use biomass energy are all part of the sustainable carbon cycle. Although EPA acknowledges that biomass energy can have climate benefits compared to using fossil fuels, EPA’s final Clean Power Plan (CPP), which regulates GHG emissions from existing electric utilities under the Clean Air Act (CAA), sets up significant hurdles for states to qualify their use of biomass energy as a compliance measure. In addition, EPA’s revised accounting framework for biogenic CO2 emissions and the accompanying policy guidance released in November 2014 acknowledge the carbon benefits from certain forest products manufacturing residuals. However, our industry needs greater certainty regarding the carbon neutrality for all manufacturing residuals and “sustainably-derived biomass.”\nAF&PA is a strong proponent of international efforts to suppress illegal logging because trade in illegally sourced fiber is a serious detriment to the industry’s sustainability, the environment and the global economy. AF&PA supports language in the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement negotiated by the U.S. and countries in the Asia-Pacific region that calls for strong laws against illegal logging and associated trade and their enforcement. An AF&PA commissioned study estimated that illegal logging cost the U.S. forest products industry some $1 billion annually in lost export opportunities and depressed U.S. wood prices.\nAF&PA is working closely with a broad consensus coalition of businesses, conservation groups, and labor organizations that is calling on federal agencies to ensure successful implementation of the law. AF&PA supports adequate funding for the implementation of the Lacey Act and the phase-in of the declaration requirement to imports of composite wood products and pulp and paper.\nAF&PA supports administrative clarification that the Lacey Act amendments do not apply to products imported or manufactured prior to May 2008, and the Lacey Act should not be enforced against individual consumers.\nInternational Trade and Competitiveness\nPaper and wood products exports account for about 15 percent of the industry’s annual total sales. In 2015, the industry’s global exports totaled about $30.3 billion, of which nearly $8.9 billion were exports of wood products and $21.4 billion were exports of pulp, paper and packaging.\nAF&PA supports free and fair trade. In an increasingly globalized market, it is critical for the U.S. paper and wood products manufacturing industry to achieve unrestricted access to international markets and level the playing field among international competitors by eliminating both tariff and non-tariff barriers.\nFree trade agreements offer opportunities for achieving the industry’s trade and competitiveness objectives — including the speedy elimination of foreign tariffs and non-tariff barriers. Therefore, AF&PA supports for congressional approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, because it will eliminate forest products tariffs and establish a strong platform for achieving further trade liberalization in the fast growing Asia-Pacific region. AF&PA also supports the free trade negotiations with the European Union, called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. This trade deal provides an opportunity to eliminate tariffs, non-tariff barriers and regulatory impediments to trade in one of the top export markets for U.S. forest products.\nNAAQS Permitting Updates\nRegulated industries are finding it increasingly difficult to expand due to out of date and unrealistic permitting requirements. EPA should defer any tightening of NAAQS until a smoother permitting process is reestablished.\nThe inability to permit a project hurts the competitiveness of the facility, harms product development and innovation, and can thwart environmentally beneficial projects. Local communities will miss out on new jobs and economic growth while industry sectors face the risk of becoming uncompetitive in the global marketplace of forest products.\nA record 66.8 percent of paper consumed in the U.S. was recovered for recycling in 2015, and the annual paper recovery rate in the U.S. has nearly doubled since 1990. By weight, more paper is recovered from municipal solid waste streams than glass, plastic, and aluminum combined, according to EPA. Recovering paper extends the useful life of fiber and saves valuable landfill space. Paper recycling is widely accessible, with 96 percent of Americans having access to community curbside and/or drop-off paper recycling programs. The existing voluntary, market-based paper recovery system fuels innovation, creates lasting infrastructure, and enables us to make new products from paper that is diverted from the waste stream.\nThe U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is the essential component of a $1.4 trillion mailing industry that employs about 7.5 million Americans in large and small business enterprises across the country. Serving 153 million residents, offices and businesses across the country, the Postal Service connects people and business transactions through a sophisticated delivery infrastructure no other entity can provide. In addition, approximately one-third ($6 billion worth) of communications papers produced in the U.S. are delivered through the mail system.\nContinuing financial losses without much-needed legislation will force USPS to take more drastic actions that could have disruptive, negative effects on customers, jobs and the availability of postal services upon which many Americans depend. Only Congress, through postal reform legislation, can make necessary changes to address the major drivers of Postal Service losses that will ensure mail is an affordable and effective option that meets the service needs of customers. Postal reform legislation must address the fundamental causes of USPS financial challenges. Legislators must recognize that rate increases and reductions in service will drive customers away and further accelerate the decline in mail volume.\nAF&PA supports legislative measures that ensure the fiscal viability of the USPS by eliminating unreasonably imposed financial obligations to the Postal Service; allows the Postal Service to innovate and develop new revenue sources; support service standards that meet the needs of the public and business customers, including continued six day mail delivery; ensures postal rate setting has checks and balances that provide price predictability for mailers and cost-control incentives for USPS; and enable mail as a cost competitive option for business communications.\nPromoting Access to Paper Options for Government Programs\nAF&PA believes the public should be able to choose the manner in which they receive information and services from the government and not be forced into a digital-only option. Paper and digital formats can be complementary; those who wish to receive paper-based communications and documentation should not be forced to either use digital delivery or forgo the information or service.\nWe support policies that recognize paper-based communications are critically important for millions of Americans. Federal agencies should not eliminate a paper option without a cost-benefit analysis, but should provide adequate public notice to people affected by a proposed elimination of paper options, allowing ample opportunity to provide input and taking public comments into account before making a final decision. Federal agencies proposing the elimination of paper options must ensure safeguards are put into place to protect personal information from identity theft or fraud before requiring a digital-only option.\nThe government’s rush to digitize puts millions of Americans at a disadvantage, many of whom are in rural communities and/or low income households — 45 percent of seniors do not own a computer and 30 percent of citizens do not have online access at home.\nRecycled Content Mandates\nAF&PA opposes recycled content mandates as an ineffective path to increasing paper recovery. Additionally, the distinction between pre- and post-consumer content constrains the amount of recovered fiber available for recycling and should not be used in government policies. EPA is considering changes to federal purchasing requirements that would require communication papers to have 100 percent post-consumer recycled content.\nMandating post-consumer recycled content for fiber-based products creates the misleading perception that certain types of recovered fiber are better than others. Not all types of recovered fiber are suitable for recycling into communications papers, and available post-consumer sources of recovered fiber are declining.\nRather than arbitrarily mandating 100 percent recovered content in communications papers, EPA should take a more measured approach that accounts for all of the environmental and economic consequences that mandates impose. The aim should be to increase paper recovery, and the U.S. paper industry has demonstrated its commitment by achieving a paper recovery rate of over 66 percent and working towards an industry-wide goal to exceed 70 percent recovery by 2020.\nAF&PA’s comprehensive sustainability initiative — Better Practices, Better Planet 2020 — includes six measurable goals focusing on paper recovery for recycling, energy efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable forestry practices, workplace safety, and water use. Our members have long been good stewards of our planet’s resources, and this initiative shows our proactive approach to the long-term success of our industry, our communities, and our environment. We have made great strides towards reaching the Better Practices, Better Planet 2020 goals, surpassing those for greenhouse gas emissions and workplace safety ahead of schedule.\nAF&PA urges Congress to reform the federal tax system in a manner that promotes economic growth, job opportunities, and the competitiveness of U.S.-based businesses. We believe the tax code should provide a level playing field for business activity and avoid picking “winners and losers” among economic players. The U.S. has uncompetitive business tax rates on domestic income and needs of major reforms to its system of international income taxation. AF&PA opposes retroactive tax changes and urges appropriate transition relief as part of comprehensive tax reform.\nAF&PA supports making critical improvements to America’s transportation efficiency by safely increasing the maximum Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) on federal interstate highways with an additional axle. An increase in the maximum allowable weight of six-axle semi-trailers is an effective and safe way to increase truck productivity and America's freight capacity. Technology improvements and stronger roads and bridges make it safe for each truck to carry more freight. It would also mitigate the current transportation capacity shortage that inhibits moving raw materials to mills and products to customers.\nAF&PA also supports legislation to reform the Surface Transportation Board to effectively address rail service challenges for shippers. Rail customers are not receiving reliable rail service at reasonable rates. Nearly one-third of forest products facilities have access to only one rail carrier. The railroad industry has an obligation to serve its customers and the nation’s freight rail needs, but many see their monopoly status as an opportunity to charge excessive rates while providing poor service.""]"	['<urn:uuid:a1db1a24-9d2b-415d-851d-3bc3e4fb6a71>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	7	68	2571
19	grid sampling soil tests advantages for precision agriculture number cores needed per grid cell	Grid sampling uses GPS to divide fields into equal squares or rectangles (2.5-acre, 4-acre, or 8-acre grids) for systematic soil testing. Five to seven cores should be collected from each grid cell, taken either at the center and within 30 feet in each direction, or randomly throughout the cell. This systematic approach allows tracking changes over time by returning to the same GPS locations and helps determine nutrient variability across the field. For larger grid patterns, the spacing can extend to several hundred feet and is often based on fertilizer applicator width.	['» Fall or spring are the best times for soil sampling.\n» At least every four years soil should be tested for nutrient availability and pH changes.1,2\n» Sampling patterns can affect the number of collected soil samples and the precision of soil test results.\n» Using global positioning system (GPS) can help map changes in nutrient availability across a field by enabling repeated soil sampling at the same locations.\nThe optimum time to test soil is when growing crops have their greatest uptake of nutrients to support plant growth. Since sampling in the summer is often not practical, the timeframes after harvest and prior to fall fertilization or prior to spring fertilization offer an alternative timing. Fall or spring sampling is preferred, since winter sampling may give misleading results due to physical changes in soil from cold winter temperatures.\nHow Often And How Many\nSoil tests are recommended at least every four years. Nutrient availability is highly influenced by environmental conditions, and the seasonal variation should be accounted for when collecting soil samples; especially when comparing soil test results across years. Due to nutrient variability, sampling should occur at the same time of year and following the same crop. Each field or practical management area should be sampled separately. The recommended number of soil samples is a compromise between what is acceptable by the grower from both a cost and precision standpoint. However, the number of samples collected should correspond with capturing variability within the field. Increased field-level variation or intensive management will increase the number of samples required to better explain the relationship of soil test results to crop response.\nRecommendations vary for the number of cores taken at each sampling point, ranging from 5 to 7 cores at each point up to 15 to 20 cores.3 The goal is to collect a representative sample at each point. If an area is known to be highly variable from a soil standpoint, then more cores should be taken. Tillage also influences the number of cores required to obtain a representative sample. Due to less mixing and more spatial variation, continual no-till or fields that do not receive tillage on a regular basis will require more cores for each sample (8 to 12) than a field that receives tillage regularly.2 Sampling depth should be taken in accordance with the fertilizer recommendations intended to be used, using a soil probe or a spade. Proportionately more soil cores should be pulled as the area sampled increases.\nThe sampling pattern impacts the number of samples that will be taken in a field and the precision of soil test results.\nIf a grower chooses to manage the field as a single unit, then a single, representative soil sample should be pulled and analyzed from the field. This method may be the least expensive from a soil sampling and analysis standpoint; however, from a fertilizer cost perspective, it is likely not the most cost-effective.\nWhen collecting this representative sample, collect and composite between 10 and 20 cores for the field. A pattern which accommodates good representation of the area sampled such as a “Z” or “W” pattern is recommended. Sampling should avoid areas that are likely to skew results, such as fertilizer bands, headlands, dead furrows, areas of dust patterns along limestone roads, and areas where stockpiling of composts, manure, or lime have been placed.1,3 The volume of soil collected from these cores will be too large to fit in a sample bag, so collecting the cores in a clean, plastic bucket is recommended. Mix the cores thoroughly before filling the sample bag 1/2 to 2/3 full.\nGrid sampling uses a systematic approach that divides a field into individual squares or rectangles of equal size, often referred to as “grid cells.” Common grid cell sizes include 2.5-acre, 4-acre, and 8-acre grids. GPS is frequently used to identify precise soil sampling locations.2 Once sampling site locations are identified, a composite soil sample is pulled from within each grid cell and analyzed separately from all other grid cells. Five to seven cores from each grid cell should be collected and composited. Cores may be taken at the center of the grid cell and within 30 feet in each direction from the center of the grid cell. Alternatively, a random collection of cores throughout the grid cell can be taken. Site specific sampling by specific GPS coordinates is intended to help determine changes over time by returning to the same location each time for sampling. Or, GPS coordinates can be used to ensure sampling of different locations, so that a more complete picture of nutrient resources over time is created.\nManagement Zone Sampling\nBy definition, a management zone is an area that is managed in a similar fashion and differs from other management zones within a field.3 Management zones within a field can be identified by a single or multiple spatial characteristics (Figure 2). Common characteristics include soil type, soil slope, organic matter, yield (production), and soil electrical conductivity. Soil samples are collected at random from within each zone, bulked together, and analyzed to provide an average sample value for each unit.\nSample cores should be collected in clean plastic containers, mixed, and placed into containers (bags or boxes) designed for soil samples. Be sure to check that all sample tools are not contaminated or were not produced from materials containing elements of interest. For example, zinc-plated soil probes can influence zinc soil test results. Mark the sample so you can identify the field area it came from. Samples can either be sent immediately to a testing facility or left to dry in a dust-free location. Make sure to thoroughly complete the soil information sheet provided by the lab. Information such as cropping history, soil region, and yield goal will be used to calculate recommendations based on the soil sample. Samples can be sent to university testing facilities or to private labs.\nInterpreting The Soil Test\nOnce you have an accurate and comprehensive field assessment from soil sampling, soil testing can be repeated at the same locations to track fertility and pH changes over time. Or, subsequent sampling can be re-defined in order to analyze only representative areas of each field. Another option may be to reduce future sampling to only problem areas.\nVariability in soil test results can help explain field variability. By examining the pattern of variability, whether it is pH, phosphorus (P), or potassium (K), a grower can learn more about his field. The patterns of high and low soil property values may be tied to soil type or slope, or the patterns may help explain yield variability. Interpreting the variability in soil test values can take a bit of detective work and it may require looking at past farm records for inputs or recalling how the field was farmed in the past. Coupling prior yield and nutrient application data with soil test results can aid in explaining field variation and also aid in directing future crop management strategies.\nSoil is inherently variable, so the more samples that are taken per unit area, the more representative the soil test results will be to crop response. Important information can be obtained by monitoring changes in soil test results over time.\nIt is important to keep good records on sample locations and test results in order to evaluate the effectiveness of fertilizer programs. For example, if soil tests have been increasing over time, lower rates of fertilizer are the likely management recommendation. Or, if soil test levels are above optimum, then additions of P and K could be omitted for a period of time and levels could be monitored with soil sampling. For consistently low or deficient soil test levels, increased fertilizer rates may be recommended.\nIn summary, the quality of the sampling methods greatly influences the accuracy of soil test results. An investment in soil testing is an opportunity to make more accurate soil management decisions.\n1 Mallarino, A. and Sawyer, J. Nutrient management: Soil testing. Iowa State University Extension.

SEMINIS DOES NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION OR TECHNICAL ADVICE PROVIDED HEREIN AND DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY', 'The accuracy of a fertilizer recommendation depends on how well the soil sample on which the recommendation was based represents the area on which the recommendation will be used. The physical and chemical characteristics of soil in an area can vary considerably from place to place because of natural factors and the management to which the area has been subjected. Natural variation arises from soil-forming processes (such as mineral weathering and erosion) that lead to accumulations or losses of nutrients at different sites. Management factors might include tillage and fertilization practices, crop selection and irrigation. It may be necessary to take many samples from a given area (at random or in a systematic manner) to assess its fertility accurately.\nFour variables are generally considered when taking soil samples:\nProper consideration of these variables ensures that the sample accurately reflects the fertility of the area in question and allows for the best possible fertilizer recommendations.\nSample distribution usually depends on the degree of variability in a given area. In relatively uniform areas smaller than 25 acres, a composite sample of 20 to 30 cores taken in a random or zigzag manner is usually sufficient. Larger areas are usually subdivided into smaller ones. Non-uniform areas should be subdivided on the basis of obvious differences such as slope position or soil type.\nBanding fertilizer creates zones of very high fertility in soils because the fertilizer is mixed with only a small portion of the soil. Samples taken in the band can greatly overestimate the overall fertility of a site. Because the position of fertilizer bands is rarely known with certainty, one should take more random samples than usual in fields with fertilizer bands and vary sampling position with respect to row location to ensure that the bands do not bias test results.\nFor non-uniform sites, a systematic sampling approach is best. Sampling in a grid pattern can give an idea of variability in a field and fertilizer application can be adjusted according to the distribution of soil test results within the grid. The grid spacing can vary from as little as 30 feet to several hundred feet. Often the grid spacing is some multiple of fertilizer applicator width. Grid geometry can be adjusted to account for characteristics of the site in question. For example, a rectangular grid may be more useful than a square grid when fertilizer applications have been primarily in one direction. Eight to 10 cores are usually taken and combined for analysis at each sampling point in the grid.\nSoil samples used for nutrient recommendations should be taken at the same depth that is used in the research generating the recommendations, normally 0 to 8 inches. A major exception involves sampling sites subjected to little or no inversion tillage, including those in established forages, no-till and ridges. In such cases, additional samples should be taken at a shallower depth (0 to 4 inches) to assess acidification of the soil surface and make appropriate lime recommendations. Surface soil pH may greatly affect herbicide activity and/or carry-over problems. Occasionally sampling the soil profile in 4-inch increments also may be useful for assessing the degree of nutrient stratification in fields managed with conservation tillage, but no recommendations are being made at this time based on the results of such samples.\nSampling after harvest in the fall or before planting in the spring is recommended. Fall sampling is preferred if lime applications are anticipated. Sampling during the growing season may give erroneous results due to effects of crop uptake and other processes. In-season sampling should be used only to test soils for nitrate as a guide to sidedressing additional N. Recommendations for sampling soils for nitrate are not consistent across Indiana, Michigan and Ohio, so those interested in such tests should use in-state recommendations.\nSampling should occur at the same time of the year each time a particular field is sampled. This allows better tracking of trends in soil test values over time, which may be as important as the test values themselves.\nMost sites should be sampled every three to four years. On sites where rapid changes in fertility (particularly decreases) are expected or when high-value crops are involved, shorter sampling intervals (1 to 2 years) are recommended. Regardless of the sampling interval, records of changes in soil test values over time should be kept for each site tested.\nAfter the sample has been collected, contamination must be avoided. Common sources of contamination include dirty sampling tools, storage vessels and surfaces on which soils are spread to dry. Ashes from tobacco products can cause considerable contamination of soil samples. Soils should be shipped to the testing laboratory only in containers approved by the lab.\nIndividual cores should be mixed thoroughly to form a composite sample. Moist cores should be crushed into aggregates approximately 1/8 to 1/4 inch across for optimum mixing. If the mixed sample is to be dried, the drying should be done at temperatures no greater than 120 degrees F (50 degrees C). After drying, a sub-sample of appropriate size should be taken from the composite mixture and sent to the testing laboratory for analysis.\nSeveral tests are available to measure the availability of individual nutrients in the soil. The recommendations made here are based on research conducted using very specific tests, which are identified for each nutrient. Producers and consultants should always be certain their fertilizer recommendations are based on research using the same procedures used to generate their soil test results.\nThe specific procedures used to test soils in Indiana, Michigan and Ohio are described in NCR Publication 221, 1988, Recommended Chemical Soil Test Procedures for the North Central Region, written by the USDA-sanctioned North Central Regional Committee on Soil Testing and Plant Analysis (NCR-13) and published by the North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station. Other procedures may yield results incompatible with the recommendations given here.\nAll soil test data in this publication are reported as parts per million (ppm) rather than pounds per acre (lb/acre). The change to ppm is being made because it more truly represents what is measured in the soil. Soil test values are an index of availability and do not reflect the total amount of available nutrients in soil. The use of lb/acre in the past has also led to some confusion about soil testing and the resulting fertilizer recommendations. Most commercial soil test laboratories are currently reporting soil test values in terms of ppm. To convert ppm to lb/acre multiply ppm by 2.\nJay W.

21	smart home hubs advantages security issues	Smart home hubs offer the advantage of controlling the widest array of devices from one central app or interface and getting them working together. For example, they enable multi-step actions like automatically triggering lights, alarms, and thermostats when your phone is detected. However, security is a major challenge, requiring a comprehensive suite of protection including secure identity, secure authorization/attestation, secure provisioning, and secure over-the-air updates for field devices.	['How does the smart home of your dreams look? Maybe your front door automatically unlocks when it detects your phone is nearby, disabling the home alarm system and triggering the lights and air conditioning to turn on. The door automatically locks behind you. As the sun sets, the lighting in the room softens, the A/C shuts off, and the blinds close. The key is to get the smart home components you buy to communicate—and for that, you need a smart home hub. But what is a smart home hub? This guide will answer that question and more.\nNot everyone with a smart home setup needs a dedicated smart home hub, however. You can do a lot without one. The greatest advantage of having a hub is being able to control the widest array of devices from one central app or interface and get them working together. Here’s what else you need to know about smart home hubs before deciding to buy one.\nWhat is a smart home hub?\nA smart home hub is like a central command for a smart home. It’s hardware or software (often both) that connects to smart home devices, allowing you to control them all from one app. Let’s say you have smart light bulbs, a smart lock on your front door, and a smart thermostat. Rather than manage each one separately, you can connect them all to a smart home hub and control them from one place.\nYou can also create multi-step actions that all your devices will do automatically, even if they’re made by different manufacturers. For example, you can set up a series of actions so that when you arrive home and your smart lock detects your phone, it automatically triggers the lights to turn on, your home alarm to turn off, and the thermostat to adjust to a temperature of your choosing.\nSmart home hub examples\nThe variety of smart home hubs on the market today makes it a little confusing to see how they are all related. Some are standalone products, and some have the technology bundled into another product. Some are hardware plus an app, and some are just apps.\nOne straightforward example of a smart home hub, which was among the first ever to be created, is the SmartThings Hub by Samsung. It looks similar to a router, and in fact, it connects to your router to work. Wink Hub 2 is another straightforward example.\nSmartThings has other smart home hubs, too, such as the Samsung SmartThings WiFi. It’s a Wi-Fi router and smart hub bundled into one device. Bundling together a smart home hub and router makes sense. When other products start bundling in smart home hub technology, however, it can get a little more confusing. Smart home hubs can be bundled into home security system panels, streaming boxes such as the Apple TV 4K, and other devices.\nMost smart speakers are smart home hubs—or at least they act like them. The Amazon Echo Plus (2nd Gen) properly doubles as a smart home hub, while the original Amazon Echo isn’t technically a hub. The original Echo still provides so much of the same functionality, however, that for many people, the difference isn’t meaningful.\nWhat about software-only hubs? Eve is one such hub for Apple HomeKit devices. The Stringify app lets you connect a variety of smart home devices to it. Wink’s app works with or without the hub, although there are some advantages to having a hub, which will be further explained later. Yonomi is another that’s compatible with not only iOS and Android but also Apple Watch and Android Wear.\n- What is Google Home?\n- Google Home vs. Google Home Mini: Which is better?\n- Apple Homepod vs Google Home vs Amazon Echo\n- How to use Google Home as an intercom system\nHow do smart home hubs work?\nA smart home hub is the command center for your smart home. You connect other devices to the hub. The hub gives you remote control access to these devices from an app, or through another connected device, such as a smart speaker.\nHow all of your devices connect to the hub is part of the magic. Many smart home hubs support more than one connection type (protocol). Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are two well-known ways of wirelessly connecting devices. Other smart home gadgets use a different protocol, such as Zigbee or Z-Wave.\nThere are other types of protocols for connecting devices around your home that aren’t even wireless, such as universal powerline bus, or UPB. That method uses your home’s electrical wiring to transmit communication, and it can be peer-to-peer. UPB is still commonly used in intercom systems. Before the days of DIY wireless products, UPB and other early protocols, such as X10, were the only option for creating a smart home. These days, UPB is still around, and the devices that use them sometimes even have an option to connect to a smart home hub, so you can still rely on one app to run everything.\nWhy can’t I connect everything via Wi-Fi?\nYou might be wondering, “Couldn’t I simply buy all Wi-Fi-compatible devices and connect to them that way?” Yes, you could, but depending on your setup, it might create problems.\nIf you connect too many devices to your home Wi-Fi, then the whole network slows down. Additionally, Wi-Fi connectivity tends to drain batteries faster than other protocols do. Depending on your setup, you’d probably end up with a few different apps to control your devices rather than one app to manage them all. And not all smart home devices are Wi-Fi-enabled, so you’d be cutting yourself short on the products you could buy. You could still create automations across smart home devices from different manufacturers using IFTTT, an app that stands for “if this, then that.” But overall, relying on Wi-Fi alone to set up a smart home is not ideal.\nWhy do smart home hubs connect to smart speakers?\nIf you’re interested in buying a smart home hub, you’ll see a bunch of them advertise that they support Amazon Alexa or Google Home. This can be confusing if you thought smart speakers already were smart home hubs! What gives?\nAs mentioned, some smart speakers are true home hubs. Amazon Echo Plus is the prime example because it supports the protocol Zigbee, although it doesn’t support Z-Wave. So, you can connect devices if they use the Zigbee protocol.\n- Amazon Alexa is the home assistant you never knew you needed\n- 12 essential Amazon Echo accessories for your smart home\n- You can now use Amazon Alexa devices as an intercom system\n- The Amazon Fire Stick can help you finally cut the cord\nOther speakers don’t quite measure up because they don’t support commonly used protocols for connectivity, or because the digital assistant app is really the hub and not the speaker itself.\nIn any event, you might set up your smart home using a smart home hub and add a smart speaker so that you can use voice commands around your home. If you choose a hub that doesn’t rely on having a speaker, you don’t have to worry about a device that’s listening to everything that goes on under your roof.\nDo I need a smart home hub?\nUltimately, do you need a smart home hub at all? It depends on:\n- How many smart home products you need to control\n- How elaborately you want to connect them\n- The ease with which you want to be able to control your devices\n- Whether you already own something that can act as a hub, given your setup.\nYou don’t necessarily need a smart home hub to have elements of a smart home in place. If you plan to add to your smart home over time, a hub will certainly give you a lot of benefits, and it may be to your advantage to start with early on so that you can master it long before your home looks like Tony Stark’s.', 'Smart-home products encompass a variety of devices that includes smart lighting, connected appliances, security systems, and health-care monitoring. A 2020 Jabil Smart Home Technology Trends survey of IoT manufacturing stakeholders, conducted by Dimensional Research, found that the market has more than doubled in two years, according to nearly 60% of respondents. Forty percent of stakeholders experienced 2× to 5× growth.\nWhile demand and adoption of these devices continue to grow, product development teams face increasing challenges around security, privacy, and connectivity. One of the biggest design challenges is connectivity, according to the Jabil survey, with human-machine interface and device-to-internet connectivity (Wi-Fi, 5G, etc.) leading the trouble spots.\nOther product development challenges, cited by survey takers, include a lack of reference architectures that address both hardware and software (30%), increasingly complicated specs for hardware creation (23%), and a lack of technical expertise and capabilities to build connected solutions (22%).\nThis month’s issue on smart homes takes a look at some of the devices and systems that can help product developers ease some of these challenges around security, connectivity, and technical expertise, as well as time-to-market concerns.\nOne of the biggest problem solvers for helping designers reduce hardware development work and simplify connectivity are wireless microcontroller (MCU) modules. These highly integrated modules provide matching circuits, security, connectivity, pre-certifications, and, in some cases, pre-provisioning for the cloud. They also come with hardware reference designs that offer benefits in several areas, including lower design risk and faster time to market. In some cases, designing with these modules requires little to no RF design expertise.\nToday’s developers face more challenges than ever when making their design decisions, including longer development times and higher security threats, said Maurizio Di Paolo Emilio, editor-in-chief of Power Electronics News. Development kits and other prototyping platforms are vital to accelerate innovation and are one of the best ways to get started on any IoT project, he said. Maurizio discusses a few development kit and platform examples that can help developers get started on their projects.\nA big part of IoT challenges is security, agreed industry players. Nitin Dahad, editor-in-chief of Embedded.com, reports that security for smart homes is all about identity and trust. Protecting smart-home devices from security risks requires a suite of protection, he said, which includes secure identity, secure authorization/attestation, secure provisioning, and secure over-the-air updates for when the device is in the field.\nOne component area that is being significantly impacted by the “smart” trend, whether it is homes, buildings, vehicles, industrial equipment, or medical devices, is MCUs. In most IoT applications, power consumption and enhanced security have become the biggest pain points for designers. Over the past six months alone, many chipmakers have developed new product offerings that address these issues.\nBut it’s more than just low standby current and advanced security features like symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, advanced key management, and tamper detection. These chipmakers are also providing a range of development boards, tools, and kits, including IDEs, software suites, and application examples, all designed to ease product development.\nThere are still several challenges that impede IoT growth, said Jake Alamat, vice president and general manager of IoT Home & Consumer at Silicon Labs, and it will require intuitive user experiences, increased security, and greater interoperability for the transformation into intelligent IoT smart homes. He said: “There are still too many incompatible protocols; numerous smart-home devices don’t work effectively across multiple ecosystems; and there is an increased need for device security. So what needs to be done to enable the future smart home?”\nWhile more work still needs to be done, said Alamat, “new industry collaboration is opening doors for greater interoperability and developing new standards that will extend the intelligent, secure boundaries of the home beyond what we can imagine today.”\n(Cover image: Shutterstock)']	['<urn:uuid:628b7e3e-c21d-4137-b59b-bd988d5a3776>', '<urn:uuid:b1306df8-d9b4-45ff-bb14-5d80c37a47a3>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	6	68	1970
22	mahayana hinayana practice differences explain	Mahayana and Hinayana practitioners follow distinctly different paths. Hinayana practitioners focus on individual liberation and, upon reaching their goal, abide in peace. In contrast, Mahayana practitioners are characterized by great compassion and take responsibility for freeing all beings from cyclic existence. After taking Refuge, while Hinayana practitioners focus on basic practices like daily prayers, Mahayana practitioners expand to include compassion meditation (Tong-Len) aimed at developing love for all beings. The key distinction is that Mahayana practitioners, driven by compassion, continue working for others' welfare even after reaching buddhahood, whereas Hinayana practitioners remain in peaceful abiding after achieving their aims.	['Compassion is the entrance to the Mahayana. Showing the root of the Mahayana path is compassion has three parts: the importance of compassion in the beginning, in the middle, and at the end. The glorious Candrakirti taught that just as seeds, water, and ripening are important in the beginning, middle, and end of a harvest, similarly compassion is important in the beginning, middle, and end of the harvest of buddhahood.\nCompassion is important in the beginning because feeling responsible to free all beings requires great compassion. Just as the movement of the breath is the prerequisite for the life force of a human being, the great compassion of the bodhisattvas is the prerequisite for correctly reaching the Mahayana.\nIn the middle, by accustoming yourself to increasingly greater compassion that is not just a one-time development, you become less concerned with your own happiness or suffering and are not discouraged at providing others’ welfare.\nAt the end, based on the power of great compassion, buddhas, even when they reach their goal, do not abide in peace like Hinayana practitioners, but continue to work for the welfare of beings as long as space remains.\nBelow is the excerpt from The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment (Lamrim Chenmo), Volume Two, by Tsong-kha-pa on the qualities and importance of compassion.\n1. The importance of compassion in the beginning\nOnce your mind is moved by great compassion, you will definitely make the commitment to free all living beings from cyclic existence. If your compassion is weak, you will not. Therefore, compassion is important in the beginning because feeling responsible to free all beings requires great compassion and because, if you do not take on this responsibility, you are not ranked as a Mahayana practitioner. In this vein, the Teachings of Aksayamati Sutra (Aksayamati-nirdesa-sutra) states:\nFurthermore, Venerable Sariputra, the great compassion of the bodhisattvas is inexhaustible. Why? Because it is the prerequisite. Venerable Sariputra, just as the movement of the breath is the prerequisite for the life force of a human being, the great compassion of the bodhisattvas is the prerequisite for correctly reaching the Mahayana.\nAlso the Foremost of Gaya (Gaya-sirsa) states:\n“Manjusri, what is it that motivates the bodhisattvas deeds? What is its object?” Manjusri said, “Devaputra, great compassion motivates the bodhisattva deeds; its object is living beings.”\nThus compassion is the basis of engaging in the deeds because when you see that you will not live up to your commitment without training in the two vast collections, you set about the difficult work of amassing these vast collections.\n2. The importance of compassion in the middle\nYou may develop the spirit of enlightenment at one time and then engage in the bodhisattva deeds. But when you see that living beings are innumerable and act improperly, that the training is very difficult and limitless, and that you need an immeasureable length of time, you may lose heart and fall into the Hinayana. However, by accustoming yourself to increasingly greater compassion that is not just a one-time development, you become less concerned with your own happiness or suffering and are not discouraged at providing others’ welfare. Therefore, you easily accomplish all the collections. Kamalasila’s first Stages of Meditation (Bhavana-krama) states:\nBecause bodhisattvas are moved by great compassion, they diligently strive to be very helpful to others without considering themselves. Consequently, they engage in accumulating the two collections, which is very difficult, tiring, and requires a long period of time. As the Seal of Engaging in Developing the Power of Faith Sutra (Sraddha-baladhanavatara-sutra) says:\nOne who has great compassion will always take on a life of suffering and will always give up a happy life in order to help all living beings to mature.\nIf bodhisattvas engage like this in something that is extremely difficult to do, they will fully and quickly complete the collections. They will definitely attain the high state of omniscience. Therefore the sole root of a buddha’s qualities is compassion.\n3. The importance of compassion at the end\nBased on the power of great compassion, buddhas, even when they reach their goal, do not abide in peace like Lesser Vehicle practitioners, but continue to work for the welfare of beings as long as space remains. For, without compassion buddhas would be like sravakas. Kamalasila’s second Stages of Meditation says:\nSince the bhagavan buddhas are imbued with great compassion they remain until the end of the realm in which beings dwell, even though they have attained the complete perfection of their own aims.\nThe sole cause of the non-abiding nirvana of the bhagavans is great compassion.\nThe glorious Candrakirti taught that just as seeds, water, and ripening are important in the beginning, middle, and end of a harvest, similarly compassion is important in the beginning, middle, and end of the harvest of buddhahood. His Commentary on the “Middle Way” (Madhyamakavatara) states:\nCompassion alone is regarded as the seed of a conqueror’s excellent harvest,\nAs water for its development,\nAnd as the maturation in a state of long enjoyment.\nTherefore at the beginning I praise compassion.\nWith this powerful idea in view, the Compendium of the Teachings Sutra (Dharma-samgiti-sutra) says:\nBhagavan, bodhisattvas should not learn many teachings. Bhagavan, if bodhisattvas grasp and know one teaching, they will have all the Buddha’s teachings in the palm of their hand. What is this one teaching? It is great compassion.\nBhagavan, with great compassion all the Buddha’s teachings are in the bodhisattvas’ palm. For example, Bhagavan, wherever the precious wheel of a universal sovereign is, there also is the assembly of his battalions. Likewise, Bhagavan, wherever the bodhisattvas’ great compassion is, there are all the Buddha’s teachings. For example, Bhagavan, once there is a life force, all the other sensory faculties will exist. Bhagavan, similarly, once great compassion exists, all the other bodhisattvas’ qualities will appear.\nOnce you become convinced that compassion is the excellent key to the path through such proof as reason and limitless scriptures, why would you not hold the spirit of enlightenment together with its root—compassion—to be the supreme instruction? The teacher Shang-na-chung (Zhang-sna-chung) said, “Even though I asked for instructions from the Great Elder [Atisha], he said nothing except: ‘Renounce the world; cultivate the spirit of enlightenment.” Upon hearing this, Geshe Drom-dön-ba (dGe-bshes ‘Brom-ston-pa-rgyal-ba’i-‘byung-gnas) was embarrased for him and said, “You received the Great Elder’s ultimate instruction!” Geshe Drom-dön-ba understood the core of the teaching.\nThis conviction is very difficult to achieve, so you must seek a stable and certain knowledge by repeatedly clearing away sins, accumulating merit, and reading scriptures such as the Array of Stalks Sutra and the commentaries. The glorious Matrceta’s Praise in One Hundred and Fifty Verses (Sata-pancasatka-stotra) says:\nOnly you, O hero [Buddha], know your precious spirit,\nThe seed of perfect enlightenment,\nTo be the quintessence;\nNo one else can reach this certainty.', '|Step by Step: A Summary of the Karma Kagyu Tibetan Buddhist Path as Taught in America\n(By Kathy Wesley. Last revised 7.30.02)\nThe Practice Path of a Kagyu Buddhist\nA student usually begins with quiet sitting meditation, called Shinay in Tibetan and Shamata in Sanskrit. This practice calms the mind and makes it workable for further practice.When the student feels ready to seriously pursue the Buddhist path, the student requests a lama (teacher) to give the Refuge vow, the first formal ceremony of the Buddhist path.\nAfter taking Refuge, the student continues practicing Shinay and adds to his or her practice a set of daily prayers that keep the Refuge vow fresh and strong in their minds. This is a basic means of practice in the Hinayana (Individual Liberation Vehicle).\nWhen the student feels ready to deepen his or her meditation practice, they may ask the lama (or Meditation Instructor) to teach them compassion meditation, called Tong-Len in Tibetan. This meditation increases the student’s love and compassion for themselves and other beings, and opens the door to the Mahayana (Vehicle for the Liberation of All) teachings. Tong-Len also gives the student a powerful technique for working with afflictive emotions.\nAt any time along this path -- from their first visit to the meditation center until they take Refuge and then afterward -- students may attend sessions of Chenrezig meditation. This meditation of the Bodhisattva of Compassion (called Chenrezig in Tibetan, Kwan Yin in Chinese, and Avalokiteshvara in Sanskrit) also aims to increase compassion and train students in the altruistic motivation (called Jang Chub Sem in Tibetan, or Bodhicitta in Sanskrit) that is the heart of the Mahayana path. This meditation, which employs chanting and visualization, is also the introduction for students to the Vajrayana (or Diamond Vehicle), a series of trainings that help students accomplish spiritual awakening quickly.\nAfter taking Refuge, students can learn other mantra-based meditations, such as Green Tara, Medicine Buddha and so forth. These meditations focus on particular enlightened qualities -- the removal of obstacles for Tara, healing for Medicine Buddha -- and help students train in those qualities.\nEventually, students who wish to undertake the deepest meditation practice of the Karma Kagyu lineage, called Mahamudra, can ask the lama for instruction in the Mahamudra Preliminaries, called Ngondro. These preliminaries, which consist of guided meditations designed to purify negativities, increase awakened qualities, and seek the blessings of the lineage, take several years to complete, and help students create a powerful daily spiritual training regimen.\nAfter completing Ngondro, many other practices -- including lifelong mantra practices -- can be given to the student. These will be explained at the time when they are given.\nMany, though not all, teachers of the Karma Kagyu rely on a training process that some call the “bee and flower” method.\nIn this metaphor for the teaching process, the teacher is the flower, and the student is the bee. When the bee needs nectar, it goes to the flower for nourishment. It takes away nectar, and when it is hungry again, it goes to the flower for more.\nIn the same way, students visit lamas, and get their instructions from that teacher. Then, they go home and practice what they are taught, returning to the teacher for clarifications and to remedy doubts about their practice.\nThis means the path is, in many cases, student-directed. Lamas may make practice suggestions -- and some even give practice-related “homework” to students -- but it is up to students to choose their teacher, and to decide whether to take on what has been suggested to them by their lama. If a student does not feel ready to take on a practice suggested by the lama, it is important for the student to say so immediately, so the teacher can be advised of the student’s intentions.\nTeachers want nothing more than for students to enjoy their practice and deepen their commitment to dharma, so students should make use of their teachers whenever they need to.\nLineage, Empowerments, and Samayas\nWhile many Buddhist teachers -- Tibetan, Chinese, Japanese and others -- visit America in any given year, it is important for a student to make a commitment to a particular lineage and set of teachers. Otherwise, the student’s practice will lack focus, and the student will not make satisfactory progress along the path.\nWhen you have the opportunity to take empowerments or teachings from lamas of other lineages, it is always best to ask your own lama for advice. When you take an empowerment or a teaching from a teacher, you forge a bond (called samaya in Tibetan) with that teacher and his or her lineage. The teacher may then expect you to maintain that connection by visiting him or her often or by taking further teachings with them or visiting their monasteries, etc.\nWhen you take a teaching or empowerment from a lineage master, you become part of that teacher’s lineage -- the “next in line,” so to speak, in that lineage. You then bear a responsibility to keep that lineage going.\nThat is why it is important to be very careful when choosing teachers and empowerments. It is not like choosing an evening’s entertainment -- it is choosing a direction for your spiritual path.']	['<urn:uuid:30facfb3-1b61-46ee-9393-35351857ef2f>', '<urn:uuid:b2016b69-623f-4ba1-a4c2-2f663ae774fb>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	5	99	2018

Manufacturers who specialise in producing lower sugar products are not being stocked around 80% of the time, despite having large-scale production capacity. They are routinely refused listings by retailers who say that sugar is not on their agenda.	['Research by Netmums and Sugarwise reveals 80% of parents regularly search for low/no sugar products for their family, yet 30% of parents can’t find these products in-store\nManufacturers of lower sugar products are routinely told by retailers refusing to list them that sugar is “not a priority”\n75% of parents would be willing to spend more on low sugar/good taste foods if they were available\n38% of parents say they are unable to find low/no sugar lunchbox snacks\nA survey by Netmums, the leading parenting website and Sugarwise, the international authority for sugar claims on foods, has revealed 80% of parents regularly look for low or no sugar products for their family, yet 30% of parents say they are unable to find these products in store.\nThe research, undertaken ahead of a Westminster Sugar Summit intended to tackle the need for, and steps being taken, to open up lower sugar choices for consumers, and particularly children, has also revealed parents have most trouble finding healthy lunchbox snacks, with 38% complaining they have trouble finding low sugar options in supermarkets.\n17% of parents say have been unable to find low/no sugar breakfast cereal, 15% have been unable to find low/no sugar deserts, 17% have been unable to find low/no sugar pasta sauce, and 12% have been unable to find low/no sugar baking ingredients.\nDespite the lack of product availability, the Netmums/Sugarwise survey also revealed many parents would be willing to spend more on low sugar foods if they were available with 40% saying they would be happy to pay more for healthy option foods as long as the products taste good.\nWhen asked ‘which foods would you like to see low sugar versions of at your local supermarket’, parents cited in order of preference:\n1) Sweet biscuits\n2) Sweetened or flavoured yogurt\n3) Sweet breakfast cereal\n4) Sweet cakes/pastries\n5) Jams and sweet spreads\n8) Ice Cream\n9) Dairy desserts\nNetmums Editor in chief, Anne-Marie O’Leary, said, “Childhood obesity is a national concern and Netmums users are increasingly worried about the levels of sugar consumption by children. Yet, our survey shows despite consumer demand for more low sugar formulations and the willingness to pay more if needed for low sugar options, retailers are failing to make these products available on shelf.”\nSugarwise has also revealed that manufacturers who specialise in producing lower sugar products are not being stocked around 80% of the time, despite all these manufacturers able to produce at a large-scale capacity.\nRend Platings, CEO and Founder of Sugarwise, said, “When I became a mum, I was shocked to find out my daughter was likely to live a shorter life than me, due to the excessive levels of sugar consumption. It’s no surprise consumption is so high when mums, and other shoppers, struggle to find lower sugar products on supermarket’s shelves….\n“I started Sugarwise to do something about this unacceptable reality, and I’m delighted Netmums is taking up the cause to show that there is a huge demand for less sugar. The good news is we work with many manufacturers who produce biscuits, chocolates, cakes, ice creams, granola, drinks and more, that are all low in free sugars – exactly what mums and dads are looking for.\n“As the international certification authority for sugar claims, we know that lower sugar manufacturers are struggling to get stocked in the major supermarkets. We have certified over 400 lower sugar products, only a fraction of which have made it onto shelf – 80% of the time they are refused listings, with sugar normally not on the retailer’s agenda. This is incomprehensible to me. And it’s a huge missed opportunity for public health.”\nAt the Sugar Summit Rend says:\n“Today is the first meeting of a new Alliance dedicated to manufactured food and drink that is better for public health, and I am delighted to announce that the Royal Voluntary Service (RVS) is the first retailer to join.

24	symptoms common between tricuspid valve ebstein anomaly mitral valve problems	Both tricuspid valve problems in Ebstein's anomaly and mitral valve regurgitation share several common symptoms, particularly related to heart failure. These include shortness of breath (dyspnea), especially during physical activity, cough, and swelling in the legs and abdomen. Both conditions can also present with heart murmurs detected during physical examination. Additionally, both can lead to reduced blood pressure and irregular heart rhythms, though mitral valve regurgitation specifically can lead to atrial fibrillation, while Ebstein's anomaly patients may experience various types of arrhythmias. Both conditions can also remain asymptomatic for many years before manifesting symptoms.	"[""Mitral valve regurgitation — also called mitral regurgitation, mitral insufficiency or mitral incompetence — is a condition in which your heart's mitral valve doesn't close tightly, allowing blood to flow backward in your heart. If the mitral valve regurgitation is significant, blood can't move through your heart or to the rest of your body as efficiently, making you feel tired or out of breath.\nVideo: Mitral valve regurgitation\nThe mitral valve is located between the upper left heart chamber (left atrium) and the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle). A healthy mitral valve keeps your blood moving in the right direction. A leaky valve doesn't close the way it should, allowing some blood to flow backward into the left atrium. If left untreated, a leaky valve could lead to heart failure.\nTreatment of mitral valve regurgitation depends on how severe your condition is, whether it's getting worse and whether you have symptoms. For mild leakage, treatment is usually not necessary.\nYou may need heart surgery to repair or replace the valve for severe leakage or regurgitation. Left untreated, severe mitral valve regurgitation can cause heart failure or heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias). Even people without symptoms may need to be evaluated by a cardiologist and surgeon trained in mitral valve disease to determine whether early intervention may be beneficial.\nSome people with mitral valve disease might not experience symptoms for many years. Signs and symptoms of mitral valve regurgitation, which depend on its severity and how quickly the condition develops, can include:\n- Abnormal heart sound (heart murmur) heard through a stethoscope\n- Shortness of breath (dyspnea), especially when you have been very active or when you lie down\n- Heart palpitations — sensations of a rapid, fluttering heartbeat\n- Swollen feet or ankles\nMitral valve regurgitation is often mild and progresses slowly. You may have no symptoms for many years and be unaware that you have this condition, and it might not progress.\nYour doctor might first suspect you have mitral valve regurgitation upon detecting a heart murmur. Sometimes, however, the problem develops quickly, and you may experience a sudden onset of severe signs and symptoms.\nWhen to see a doctor\nIf your doctor hears a heart murmur when listening to your heart with a stethoscope, he or she may recommend that you visit a cardiologist and get an echocardiogram. If you develop symptoms that suggest mitral valve regurgitation or another problem with your heart, see your doctor right away. Sometimes the first indications are actually those of mitral valve regurgitation's complications, including heart failure, a condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs.\nChambers and valves of the heart\nA normal heart has two upper (receiving) and two lower (pumping) chambers. The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood. The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of your heart. The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the correct direction, are gates at the chamber openings (for the tricuspid and mitral valves) and exits (for the pulmonary and aortic valves).\nYour heart has four valves that keep blood flowing in the correct direction. These valves include the mitral valve, tricuspid valve, pulmonary valve and aortic valve. Each valve has flaps (leaflets or cusps) that open and close once during each heartbeat. Sometimes, the valves don't open or close properly, disrupting the blood flow through your heart to your body.\nMitral valve prolapse and regurgitation\nThe mitral valve separates the two chambers (atrium and ventricle) of the left side of the heart. In mitral valve prolapse, the leaflets of the mitral valve bulge (prolapse) into the left atrium like a parachute during the heart's contraction. Sometimes mitral valve prolapse causes blood to leak back into the atrium from the ventricle, which is called mitral valve regurgitation.\nIn mitral valve regurgitation, the valve between the upper left heart chamber (left atrium) and the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle) doesn't close tightly, causing blood to leak backward into the left atrium (regurgitation).\nMitral valve regurgitation causes\nMitral valve regurgitation can be caused by problems with the mitral valve, also called primary mitral valve regurgitation. Diseases of the left ventricle can lead to secondary or functional mitral valve regurgitation.\nPossible causes of mitral valve regurgitation include:\nMitral valve prolapse. In this condition, the mitral valve's leaflets bulge back into the left atrium during the heart's contraction. This common heart defect can prevent the mitral valve from closing tightly and lead to regurgitation.\nDamaged tissue cords. Over time, the tissue cords that anchor the flaps of the mitral valve to the heart wall may stretch or tear, especially in people with mitral valve prolapse. A tear can cause leakage through the mitral valve suddenly and may require repair by heart surgery. Trauma to the chest also can rupture the cords.\nRheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever — a complication of untreated strep throat — can damage the mitral valve, leading to mitral valve regurgitation early or later in life. Rheumatic fever is now rare in the United States, but it's still common in developing countries.\nEndocarditis. The mitral valve may be damaged by an infection of the lining of the heart (endocarditis) that can involve heart valves.\nHeart attack. A heart attack can damage the area of the heart muscle that supports the mitral valve, affecting the function of the valve. If the damage is extensive enough, a heart attack can cause sudden and severe mitral valve regurgitation.\nAbnormality of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy). Over time, certain conditions, such as high blood pressure, can cause your heart to work harder, gradually enlarging your heart's left ventricle. This can stretch the tissue around your mitral valve, which can lead to leakage.\nTrauma. Experiencing trauma, such as in a car accident, can lead to mitral valve regurgitation.\nCongenital heart defects. Some babies are born with defects in their hearts, including damaged heart valves.\nCertain drugs. Prolonged use of certain medications can cause mitral valve regurgitation, such as those containing ergotamine (Cafergot, Migergot) that are used to treat migraines and other conditions.\nRadiation therapy. In rare cases, radiation therapy for cancer that is focused on the chest area can lead to mitral valve regurgitation.\nAtrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a common heart rhythm problem that can be a potential cause of mitral valve regurgitation.\nSeveral factors can increase your risk of mitral valve regurgitation, including:\nA history of mitral valve prolapse or mitral valve stenosis. However, having either condition doesn't necessarily mean you'll develop mitral valve regurgitation. A family history of valve disease also can increase risk.\nA heart attack. A heart attack can damage your heart, affecting the function of the mitral valve.\nHeart disease. Certain forms of heart disease, such as coronary artery disease, can lead to mitral valve regurgitation.\nUse of certain medications. People who take drugs containing ergotamine (Cafergot, Migergot) and similar medicines for migraines or who take cabergoline have an increased risk of mitral regurgitation. Similar problems were noted with the appetite suppressants fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine, which are no longer sold.\nInfections such as endocarditis or rheumatic fever. Infections or the inflammation they cause can damage the mitral valve.\nCongenital heart disease. Some people are born with an abnormal mitral valve prone to regurgitation.\nAge. By middle age, many people have some mitral valve regurgitation caused by natural deterioration of the valve.\nWhen it's mild, mitral valve regurgitation usually does not cause any problems. However, severe mitral valve regurgitation can lead to complications, including:\nHeart failure. Heart failure results when your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs. Severe mitral valve regurgitation places an extra strain on the heart because, with blood pumping backward, there is less blood going forward with each beat. The left ventricle gets bigger and, if untreated, weakens. This can cause heart failure.\nAlso, pressure builds in your lungs, leading to fluid accumulation, which strains the right side of the heart.\nAtrial fibrillation. The stretching and enlargement of your heart's left atrium may lead to this heart rhythm irregularity in which the upper chambers of your heart beat chaotically and rapidly. Atrial fibrillation can cause blood clots, which can break loose from your heart and travel to other parts of your body, causing serious problems, such as a stroke if a clot blocks a blood vessel in your brain.\nPulmonary hypertension. If you have long-term untreated or improperly treated mitral regurgitation, you can develop a type of high blood pressure that affects the vessels in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). A leaky mitral valve can increase pressure in the left atrium, which can eventually cause pulmonary hypertension. This can lead to heart failure on the right side of the heart."", ""|Year : 2020 | Volume\n| Issue : 2 | Page : 151-154\nEbstein's anomaly amongst adults with chronic heart failure: A case series and review of the literature\nMuhammad Nazir Shehu1, MU Sani2\n1 Department of Internal Medicine, Cardiology Unit, General Amadi Rimi Specialist Hospital, Katsina, Nigeria\n2 Department of Medicine, Bayero University Kano and Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Kano, Nigeria\n|Date of Submission||20-Oct-2019|\n|Date of Decision||30-Jun-2020|\n|Date of Acceptance||05-Jul-2020|\n|Date of Web Publication||9-Oct-2020|\nDr. Muhammad Nazir Shehu\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, Cardiology Unit, General Amadi Rimi Specialist Hospital, Katsina\nSource of Support: None, Conflict of Interest: None\nEbstein's anomaly (EA) is a rare, congenital cardiac malformation-associated apical displacement of the tricuspid valve (TV) leaflets (commonly septal), leading to atrialisation of the right ventricle and dilatation of the right atrium. Clinical presentation depends on the degree of the displacement of TV leaflets and other associated cardiac malformations. Echocardiography is the standard criterion for the diagnosis of EA.

Available from: https://www.njbcs.net/text.asp?2020/17/2/151/297603\n| Introduction|| |\nEbstein's anomaly (EA) is a rare cardiac malformation contributing to <1% of congenital heart diseases. It is the malformation of the tricuspid valve (TV) and the right ventricle (RV) characterised by apical displacement and dilatation of the right atrioventricular annulus and dilatation of the right atrium (RA) and RV. Typically, the septal TV leaflet (and the posterior/inferior leaflet in severe forms) is apically displaced relative to the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (MV). A displacement more than 0.8 cm/m2 is the diagnostic of EA. There is a subsequent variable thinning of the wall of the 'atrialised' RV along with redundancy and tethering of the anterior leaflet of the TV. This is best visualised using transthoracic echocardiography in the apical four-chamber view.\nClinical manifestation of EA may be in the form of arrhythmias, heart failure, paradoxical embolism and infective endocarditis (IE). Medical therapy is indicated in symptomatic patients of heart failure or arrhythmias. However, surgical TV repair and percutaneous radiofrequency ablation may be necessary for intractable heart failure and arrhythmias, respectively. Prophylaxis against IE is warranted.\n| Case Reports|| |\nA 26-year-old female presented with 3-year recurrent symptoms of dyspnoea on exertion, cough and legs and abdominal swelling. The symptoms started immediately after her last childbirth, and there was no previous history of similar illness in the past. Physical examination revealed bilateral pedal oedema, pulse rate of 120 beats/min irregularly irregular and blood pressure of 80/60 mmHg. First, second and third heart sounds were present, with pansystolic murmurs heard both at the left parasternal and apical areas. Initial diagnosis of congestive cardiac failure (the New York Heart Association [NYHA] IV) from likely peripartum cardiomyopathy was made.\nInvestigation results revealed cardiomegaly with the biventricular configuration on the chest X-ray [Figure 1]. Electrocardiography showed atrial fibrillation (AF), premature ventricular contractions and RV and left ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography showed massively dilated RA and RV, atrialisation of the RV and apical displacement of the septal TV 13.8 mm into the RV. The septal TV leaflet was tethered to the septum with associated severe TV regurgitation [Figure 2] and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 7.44 mmHg. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) was 0.97 mm. All other chambers were dilated with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 43%. She was placed on optimal medical therapy for heart failure and AF. The patient responded to treatment; however, she died suddenly on the 6th day of admission likely from malignant arrhythmia.\n|Figure 2: Case 1: Displaced TV into the RV (13 mm), atrialisation of RV portion and massively dilated RA. Widely dilated TV annulus, spontaneous echo contrast in the RA and RV. TV: Tricuspid valve, RV: Right ventricle, RA: Right atrium|\nClick here to view\nA 56-year-old postmenopausal female presented with a 10-month history of progressive dyspnoea on exertion, cough, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, orthopnoea and legs and abdominal swelling. She is not a known hypertensive or diabetic and had no family history of similar illness. However, the patient admitted early childhood history of breathlessness on exertion that prevented her from normal play with her peers. Physical examination revealed a middle-aged woman in mild respiratory distress anicteric, acyanosed with pitting pedal oedema up to the knee. The apex beat was laterally displaced and heaving. She had pansystolic murmur in the left parasternal area.\nInvestigation results include chest X-ray, which showed cardiomegaly with RV configuration [Figure 3]. ECG revealed RA enlargement in sinus rhythm. Echocardiography revealed massively dilated RA and RV, displaced septal TV 17.2 mm into the RV and arterialisation of the RV. Septal tethering of the TV was observed [Figure 4]. There was severe tricuspid regurgitation [Figure 5] with an estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 27 mmHg. TAPSE was 11.9 mm. Left ventricle and atrium are normal in size, with LVEF of 70%. The patient has been on optimal medical therapy and being referred for surgical correction of the malformed TV.\n|Figure 3: Case 2: Plane chest X-ray showing cardiomegaly with right ventricular configuration|\nClick here to view\n|Figure 4: Case 2: Echocardiography showing displaced septal TV, massively dilated RA and atrialisation of the RV.

She is not a known hypertensive or diabetic and no similar history in the family. Childhood history was not remarkable. She has six children, and her last childbirth was 7 years ago. Positive findings on physical examination revealed blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, displaced heaving apex and murmur of tricuspid regurgitation.\nChest X-ray showed cardiomegaly with biventricular configuration [Figure 6]. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm. Echocardiography revealed dilated chambers (more on the right side), global hypokinesia, impaired systolic function (LVEF 47%) and restrictive LV filling pattern. The septal TV is displaced 18.2 cm into the RV with aterialisation of the part of the RV [Figure 7]. There is also tethering of the septal TV leaflet. The patient is also doing well on optimal medical therapy and also being referred for corrective surgery for heart failure and has been regular on follow-up. She is also being referred for corrective surgery.\n|Figure 6: Case 3: Chest X-ray showing cardiomegaly with biventricular configuration|\nClick here to view\n|Figure 7: Case 3: Echocardiography showing dilated RA, aterialisation of the RV and displaced septal TV. RA: Right atrium, RV: Right ventricle, TV: Tricuspid valve|\nClick here to view\n| Discussion|| |\nWilhelm Ebstein first described typical cardiac defect similar to EA in 1866. The anomaly was later named 'EA' in 1927 by Alfared Amstein, and in 1937, the first case of the anomaly was described by Yates and Shapiro with associated radiographic and electrocardiographic data.\nThe haemodynamic consequences of EA occur as a result of the displacement of malformed TV leaflets into the RV. This leads to tricuspid regurgitation and malfunction of the RV. Echocardiography is the standard modality for the diagnosis of EA. The diagnosis is made when the apical displacement of the septal TV is >8 mm/m2 from the MV annulus. The three cases presented in this report had displaced leaflets of 13.1 mm/m2, 11.9 mm/m2 and 18.2 mm/m2 for Cases 1, 2 and 3, respectively.\nIn one classification of severity of EA proposed by Carpentier et al., EA is classified into four classes of A to D, depending on the volume of RV available. Type A has adequate RV volume, whereas type D has almost the entire RV aterialised except for a small portion. Types B and C are in-between and matched the cases in this report depending on the degree of atrialisation described above. EA can present at any age from foetus to the elderly age group. If the deformity of the TV is severe, neonatal congestive heart failure or even intrauterine death may occur. On the other hand, patients with isolated minor TV displacement may remain asymptomatic until late adult life, as in the present cases. A case of EA has been reported in an asymptomatic 90-year-old female who was referred for cardiologists' review due to the presence of severe systolic murmur. The patient had septal TV displaced 12 mm into the RV and was said to have six successful spontaneous vaginal deliveries. EA was also discovered in a 12-year-old boy in a specialist hospital, Kano, Nigeria. This patient like the cases in this report presented with features of congestive cardiac failure and no associated cardiac abnormalities.\nAlthough Case 1 in our series had lesser TV leaflet displacement of 13.8 mm into the RV compared to Cases 2 and 3, Case 1 had severe manifestation of the anomaly and had sudden cardiac death. Case 1 had worst form of both RV and LV functions by echocardiography compared to any of the two cases, which may explain the severe manifestation of the anomaly in that patient.\nThe management of EA is guided by its manifestation. For asymptomatic patients with mild cardiomegaly and without left-to-right shunt, patients should undergo regular evaluation by a cardiologist with expertise in adult congenital heart disease., Arrhythmia should be treated with antiarrhythmic drugs or radiofrequency ablation (treatment of choice), and antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered against IE.,, Those with symptoms and signs of heart failure should receive optimal medical therapy. Surgical therapy involves the correction of TV and RV abnormalities as well as any other associated cardiac defects. The trend is to perform surgery early before the onset of frank symptoms and signs of heart failure. Surgery is indicated in patients with NYHA Functional Class I–II plus cardiothoracic ratio of 0.65 or greater, NYHA Class III–IV, history of paradoxical embolism, significant cyanosis and arrhythmia refractory to medical and radiofrequency ablation.\n| Conclusion|| |\nAlthough EA is a rare congenital heart disease, its clinical diagnosis is very important because this malformation, which is amenable to surgery, may be confused with other congenital or acquired heart diseases. Moreover, early diagnosis may allow regular monitoring and preventive measures to be taken against fatal complications such as arrhythmias and IE that are commonly associated with the anomaly.\nDeclaration of patient consent\nThe authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

25	when submitting xorg patch what tags reviewers use approve code changes meaning explained	Reviewers use several tags: 'Acked-by' to signify approval, 'Tested-by' to indicate successful testing, 'Reviewed-by' to state the patch is appropriate without technical issues, and 'Signed-off-by' to certify writing the code or having rights to pass it as open-source.	"['X.Org uses patches to do code development. This page describes the required format of a patch as well as the workflow to create, send and apply it. We assume you have a git cloned repository and are familiar with making code changes and commits.\nNote: This workflow illustrates the lifecycle of a patch and does not constitute a development process. If you intend to develop patches for the X Server, consult their development process.\nThe patch submitter does the following:\n- Commit code changes to the local repository using the git-commit command\n- Create a patch using the git-format-patch command\n- E-mail the patch to the xorg-devel list using the git-send-email command\nThe xorg-devel list reviewers do one of the following:\n- Signify their approval or disapproval (Acked-by or Nacked-by)\n- State an opinion about the appropriateness of the patch (Reviewed-by)\n- Test the patch (Tested-by)\nThe module maintainer does the following:\n- Obtain the patch from the bug report or from the xorg-devel list\n- Apply the patch to a local repository using the git-am command\n- Push the patch to the git remote repository using the git-push command\nMaking code changes\nThis is where it all starts. Think about the reviewers when you are organizing code changes. Focus on one issue and change one or more files to resolve the issue. In our example patch, the code change only deals with fixing the wrong behavior of the mouse buttons reported by the user.\nChanges should follow the coding style guidelines.\nBefore creating a commit, ensure your git user name and e-mail is configured correctly using the git-config command. Use your real name as opposed to a nickname as you will be signing off your patches, indicating that you are able to release the patch under the licensing terms of the module.\n$> git config --global --get user.name $> git config --global --get user.email\nCreating a commit\nOnce the code changes are implemented and tested on your local repository, they must be committed. A commit object is created which wraps your code changes with various git information. It is included in the patch you will create later. Nothing is sent to the remote git repository on the freedesktop.org server.\n$> git add mipointer.c # file changed to fix the bug $> git commit -s # -s adds the sign-off tag in the commit text\nThe git commit command raises the nano editor for you to enter the commit message that is describe in the next section. When you exit the editor, the commit object is created. Monitor the changes to the local repository using the git-status command and the git-show command.\nCommit message format\nBegin the commit message with a single short (less than 78 character) line summarizing the changes, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description. Tools that turn commits into email, for example, use the first line on the Subject: line and the rest of the commit in the body.\nWhen referencing a reported bug, use the bug number from FreeDesktop Bugzilla. If there is no corresponding bug, you should upstream the bug from your distribution to freedesktop.org.\nAn example of how to reference a reported bug in the commit message:\nThe subject line summarizes the code changes contained in the patch. For large components such as the X Server, prefix with the subsystem (e.g. dix, Xi, xfree86, kdrive, etc.). Look at the xserver\'s git log to give you guidance. The subject line should also include the bug number if available.\nThe subject line from the example, as it appears in the commit object:\nmi: don\'t call UpdateSpriteForScreen if we have Xinerama enabled. #18668\nDo not type the word [PATCH] in the subject line, it gets added later when the patch is created.\nExplain in sufficient detail what the patch does and why this is necessary. This does not mean you need to describe the actual source changes (e.g. ""changed x to be 10, then added x to y""). Use common sense and look at git logs for guidance. See also ""on commit messages""\nThe message body also contains your sign-off tag, so in our example:\nSigned-off-by: Peter Hutterer <firstname.lastname@example.org>\nOther tags may be added after the patch review as hinted in the workflow overview.\nCreating a patch\nOnce the commit object has been created with the proper subject line and message body, you can create a patch for it in order to either attach it to the bug report or e-mail it to the list.\n$> git format-patch HEAD~1 # create a patch for the last commit\nThis will create a file named ""0001-description-of-my-change.patch"". Git uses the first line of the commit message (massaged for path-name safety) as the file name.\nThe subject line of the example patch:\n[PATCH] mi: don\'t call UpdateSpriteForScreen if we have Xinerama enabled. #18668\nThe git format-patch command has prefixed the commit subject line with the word [PATCH] on your behalf. If you haven\'t signed-off in the commit message body, you can do so with the --signoff option.\nIf you are submitting a patch for applications, drivers or libraries to xorg-devel list, you should add the component name next to the PATCH word using the --subject-prefix option.\n[PATCH evdev] fix crash on VT switch #12345 [PATCH libXi] convert to ANSI\nThe reviewers need to know for which component this patch is for when reading the e-mail (there are over 200 of them). You can configure the git format-patch command to always do it for you:\n$> git config format.subjectprefix ""PATCH evdev""\nIf you are sending the patch to the list, you may include additional information (benchmark results, a method how to reproduce it) after the -- in the git formatted patch. When the patch is applied, this information is omitted. If you are submitting a patch for a specific server version (not git master), then please note your version here. If this bug affected previous released versions of the X server it helps to say so too.\nPlain text format\nAlways attach patches as plain text files - if emailed then either attached or in-line. Never attach a zip file, tarball or any other archive with patches. Posting a link to a pastebin is permissible on IRC, don\'t post links on mailing lists, just attach the patch directly to the email.\nApply common sense: make it as easy as possible for others to look at the patch. The more steps required to look at your patch and write a review, the more likely it will be ignored.\nE-Mailing a patch\nE-mail the patch you have just created to the xorg-devel list for review and approval. Let\'s use the git-send-email command for that. Of course, you can use other e-mail clients to attach your patch. If you decide to use a mailer, make sure your mailer isn\'t altering the spaces or lines of the patch, or the patch won\'t work.\nConfigure the send-email client using the same git config command we have used so far. The example patch can be e-mailed using this command:\n$> git send-email --to email@example.com 0001-mi-don-t-call-UpdateSpriteForScreen-if-we-have-Xine.patch\nYou can use the --dry-run option and/or send it to yourself to try it out first.\ngit config --global sendemail.confirm always git config --global sendemail.smtpserver <your mail server> git config --global sendemail.supresscc self git config --global sendemail.from ""First Last <firstname.lastname@example.org>""\nIf you are already subscribed to xorg-devel using the address the patch comes from, and it\'s smaller than the list\'s size limit, it should be delivered immediately - otherwise it goes into a moderation queue which is usually manually processed at least once a day. If you send many patches from an address that you don\'t want all xorg-devel mail to come to, you can subscribe to the list and then go to the list options page in mailman to turn off mail delivery.\nSigning off and reviewing\nX.Org developers may use a number of tags to acknowledge patches, both in a commit message and when reviewing patches. Here\'s a short summary for each tag, please refer to the Linux kernel\'s Documentation/SubmittingPatches file for details. The summaries below are copied from that file.\n- Signed-off-by: certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to pass it on as a open-source patch. Specifically, that you agree to the Developer\'s Certificate of Origin\n- Acked-by: If a person was not directly involved in the preparation or handling of a patch but wishes to signify and record their approval of it then they can arrange to have an Acked-by: line. Acked-by: does not necessarily indicate acknowledgement of the entire patch.\n- Tested-by: A Tested-by: tag indicates that the patch has been successfully tested (in some environment) by the person named. This tag informs maintainers that some testing has been performed, provides a means to locate testers for future patches, and ensures credit for the testers.\n- Reviewed-by: A Reviewed-by tag is a statement of opinion that the patch is an appropriate modification without any remaining serious technical issues. Any interested reviewer (who has done the work) can offer a Reviewed-by tag for a patch.\nWhenever you review a patch on the mailing list or in a bugzilla, feel free to provide the appropriate tag as a reply email (or a comment on bugzilla).\nGetting no response\nWe don\'t have an abundance of developers and sometimes bugs or patches get dropped. If this happens to your patch, ping the list/bug again after a sufficient period (a few days at the very least). CC the maintainer of the matching subsystem.\nChanging a patch\nLikely, a developer will tell you to make some changes to the code or the commit message. Although you have committed your changes locally, you can still edit them.\ngit commit --amend lets you edit the last commit. By default, this only edits the commit message (e.g. git commit --amend -s adds the signed-off-by if you\'ve forgotten it). Any code changes you want to incorporate into the commit, use git add filename before amending the commit. Then re-send/attach the new patch.\nIf your patch is not the last commit in your local tree, consider using the git-rebase command in interactive mode.\nApplying a patch\nAlthough not the subject of this wiki page, it helps making better patches when you understand those on the other side of the fence. You may also want to test your own patch, round trip, by sending it to yourself.\nDownload the patch from your favorite e-mail client as plain text file in the appropriate git local repository. Use the git-am command to apply this patch.\nAlways use git to generate a patch. Why? All X.Org developers work with git and a git-formatted patch is easiest to apply and preserves ownership (which is in your interest). If you are working from a tarball or a distribution package, read generating git patches from tarballs to find out how to set up a temporary git repository.\nThis summarizes the commands needed to create and e-mail a patch such as the example used:\n$> # Edit files to make code changes $> git add file.c # Add changed files to be committed $> git commit -s # Sign-off and commit changes, write commit message $> git format-patch HEAD~1 # create a patch for the last commit $> git send-email --to email@example.com 0001-*.patch']"	['<urn:uuid:fcbf5b60-9ea9-458b-92a4-53079de6694f>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	13	38	1885
26	marine scientist seeking comparison holomictic ongael lake mixing patterns versus blue lagoon iceland water circulation	Ongael Lake in Palau is holomictic, meaning wind and sea tides through limestone fissures thoroughly mix the water, preventing the accumulation of 'dead' water at the bottom. In contrast, the Blue Lagoon in Iceland has a very different water circulation system - it receives wastewater from the Svartsengi geothermal power plant, which vents superheated waters from the ground. After the water is used for electricity generation and municipal heating, it's fed into the lagoon for recreational use. The Blue Lagoon's waters are characterized by their mineral-rich content and therapeutic properties, particularly for skin conditions.

Imagine being able to visit one of these stunning natural, scenic swimming destinations instead. Kravice Falls, Bosnia and Herzegovina Many tourists visit Kravice Falls on the Trebižat River in Bosnia and Herzegovina. (Photo: nomadFra/Shutterstock) Situated in a nature preserve along the Trebižat River, Kravice Falls is one of Europe's hidden treasures. Because it's such an obscure destination, this spectacular spot hasn't been spoiled by any major commercial tourism infrastructure. The best time to visit is in the spring, when the flora is at its greenest and the water levels are at their fullest due to the rainy season. Mooney Falls, Havasupai, Grand Canyon Mooney Falls is one of five waterfalls in Grand Canyon National Park along Havasu Creek. (Photo: Jon Roig/Flickr) After a long, grueling hike in the Grand Canyon, there's no better way to relax than with a dip in a gorgeous, cool waterfall. Mooney Falls is one of five waterfalls located in Grand Canyon National Park along the length of the Havasu creek. The gorgeous blue-green stream is named for the indigenous Havasupai people who live nearby in Supai, Arizona. Blue Lagoon, Iceland The Blue Lagoon's warm, mineral-rich waters are a boon to many people seeking temporary relief from skin conditions. (Photo: Constantin Stanciu/Shutterstock) Located in a lava field in Grindavík, this surreal swimming spot is formed from the wastewater of Svartsengi, a nearby geothermal power plant that vents superheated waters up from the ground. After generating electricity and providing heat for a municipal water heating system, the waters are fed into the lagoon for recreational use. The warm, mineral-rich waters are a boon to many people seeking temporary relief from skin conditions such as psoriasis. While the Blue Lagoon may not be naturally occurring, it certainly deserves a nod for its novelty and reputation. Skradinski buk, Krka National Park, Croatia Croatia is home to one of the most beautiful calcium carbonate waterfall systems in Europe. (Photo: dmytrok/Flickr) This stunning cascade of 17 individual falls is considered one of the most beautiful calcium carbonate waterfall systems in Europe. Located on the Krka river, the massive, crystal clear natural pool adjacent to the falls is a popular attraction for swimmers looking to cool off. Sacred Cenote, Chichen Itza, Mexico Sacred Cenote is a swimming spot and historical site in Mexico. (Photo: H. Michael Miley/Flickr) This stunning limestone sinkhole is found just north of the ancient Mayan ruins of Chichen Itza. While the cenote is a beautiful destination for swimming, it also happens to be a fascinating historical site where Pre-Columbian Mayans would perform ritual sacrifices. In the last century, several dredging expeditions recovered gold, jade, pottery and even human remains. Hamilton Pool Preserve, Austin, Texas Hamilton Pool Preserve in Austin, Texas, was created when erosion caused the dome of an underground river to collapse. (Photo: Kevin Muncie/Flickr) This natural pool was created thousands of years ago after widespread erosion caused the dome of an underground river to collapse. Located 23 miles west of Austin, Hamilton Pool has been an extremely popular summer swimming spot since the 1960s. Because the natural pool is not chemically treated, water quality must be monitored regularly, and sometimes swimming must be restricted. Devil's Pool, Zambia Devil's Pool in Zambia is not for the faint of heart. (Photo: Joepyrek/Flickr) Situated at the edge of Victoria Falls, this precarious swimming hole is not for the faint of heart. Intrepid swimmers are able to jump in and splash around without being taken over the cliff thanks to a protective rock barrier that forms a low current pool. Although the unusual attraction is considered relatively safe, there have been occasional reports of deaths over the years, so if you visit, don't push your luck! Palea Kameni, Santorini, Greece Palea Kameni, Santorini, Greece. (Photo: Andrew Hurley/Flickr) The gorgeous Aegean archipelago of Santorini is actually an ancient caldera formed after a volcanic eruption that blew apart the island in 1630 B.C. Well known for the iconic white -and-blue dwellings carved into rocky cliff faces, Santorini also boasts popular geothermal bathing areas on the uninhabited islet of Palea Kameni. While it's a gorgeous experience, be aware that the iron-rich, sulfurous wates can stain clothing and leave you smelling like eggs. Jellyfish Lake, Eil Malk island, Palau Can you guess how this lake got its name?. (Photo: denAsuncioner/Flickr) This surreal snorkeling spot is named for the millions of jellyfish that live there. Cnidarians are known for their painful stings, but these jellies were rendered stingless after evolving in an isolated marine lake environment without predators.

Some lakes have steeper banks, some are elongated in an east-west direction, some in a south-north direction. Every such detail leads to different circumstances and consequently – different new species and subspecies of animals.\nSome marine lakes of Palau are made even more exotic by the fact that they are meromictic – below the upper layer of marine water there is a layer of ""dead"", anoxic water separated by a layer of floating microorganisms, including a purple bacteria.\nSuch unusual monuments of nature serve as excellent “testing ground” for studies of evolution. Thus lately several scientists have made interesting treatises about these lakes. Lucky them (scientists!) – making science in beautiful Palau…\nJellyfish of president Remengesau\nOngael Lake is the smallest and shallowest and youngest of the famous Palau jellyfish lakes. The area of the lake is 0.9 ha, maximum length roughly 100 meters and depth – up to 4 meters. Contrary to other jellyfish lakes Uet era Ongael is holomictic – wind and sea tides (through fissures in Miocene limestone) are well mixing the water and there is not accrued “dead” water at the bottom as it happens with deeper lakes.\nAlthough lake is quite small it contains endemic subspecies of golden jellyfish Mastigias cf. papua remengesaui named after president of Palau Tommy E. Remengesau Jr. In the lake is met also another kind of jellyfish – Aurelia sp. and Cassiopea sp.\nMastigias of Ongael Lake is the most ornate of Palauan lake jellyfish – it is ornamented with solid white spots, smaller jellyfish is pale blue. This is comparatively small jellyfish, diameter does not exceed 15 cm.\nIn Ongael Lake number of jellyfish fluctuates with an approximate one year cycle, sometimes it disappears, sometimes is abundant.\nLake is new (12 – 5 thousand years old) and it is truly amazing to see how quickly a new subspecies develops in such a small lake.\n- Coral Reef Research Foundation, Marine Lakes Research Accessed 08.02.10.\n- Jellyfish swarms, tourists, and the Christ-child.

"['Southern Food Plot Planting Strategies\nApril 05, 2016\nAge, nutrition and genetics are the trinity that combine to grow big bucks. Summer food plots in the South are absolutely critical to the nutrition of your deer herd. By adhering to the following guidelines for soil prep, seed selection, planting and protection, you will be successful at providing your deer herd the nutrition it needs during its most critical nutritional stress period.\nYou will have to fight heat, drought, weeds and generally high deer densities, but in the end you will be rewarded with better deer and a better hunting experience in the fall.\nThe three main factors associated with successfully prepping soil for spring food plots are lime, fertilizer and a good seed bed. A proper soil test is needed to properly lime and fertilize according to the specific requirements of the species you intend to plant. Most counties in the South have either an extension agent or farm services office that can send your soils to the testing lab for about $8 per sample. In the South, we primarily have highly acidic soils that range in pH from 4-5.5.\nUnfortunately, most summer legumes thrive in the pH range of 6-7. This can usually be remedied by applying 1-2 tons of Aglime per acre. Fertilizer needs will vary greatly but almost always be required to grow productive spring food plots. Lime and fertilizer can be applied right before or immediately after plowing but prior to making the seed bed, and these nutrients need to be at the root level of the plant.\nThe seed bed is very critical for summertime plots because it is in this bed that your moisture will be held through the long dry summers. The best option for planting is mowing and poisoning your existing fall plots followed by no-till planting of the spring plots. For many hunters and landowners, no-till and row planters aren\'t available, so plowing is the only way to prepare a seed bed. In most upland food plots, you should attempt to plow as deep as possible and do so at least a month before your intended planting date so that you can ""bank"" spring showers into your bed prior to planting.\nIf you plow too late, your seed is at high risk of running out of important ground moisture at an age when it may not survive until the next rain. After plowing, use a drag or culti-packer to make a firm seed bed ready for planting.\nPlowing will inherently bring many weed seeds to the surface that will later compete with your food species. These weeds can be sprayed prior to planting or you can plant Round-up ready species that can be sprayed throughout the growing season. Most warm season plants require a soil temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit or higher to germinate and do not hold up well with a frost.\nBecause of these two factors, I prefer to plant with a 60 percent chance or rain or greater after May 1 across much of the South. Some areas in the deep South can be planted in April with no problem or chance of frost but they should always be planted with impending rain.\nSelecting the proper species to plant in a given food plot should be dependent on location, purpose, and size of your food plot. Planting an eighth acre of soybeans in a thick area with little sunlight and high deer densities will have you giving up on summer plots almost before you start. You need to allow the species to work for you in every way that it can.\nSome are fantastic in small plots in the shade and others simply need a lot of sun and larger areas to keep from being decimated by the hungry mouths of your herd. Keep in mind that some spring food plot species do not provide any added nutrition during the summer but are great for cover and early fall hunting plots.\nThese species are typically grains such as Grain Sorghum, Egyptian Wheat and Corn. The legumes are the highly nutritious and attractive species from the time they germinate until first frost. These legumes provide much needed protein and fiber to a deer\'s diet and also fix nitrogen into the soil, which can aid in fall food plot success. My favorite warm season legumes are Eagle Seed Soybeans, Lablab and Aeschynomene. There are also many commercial blends that can also be successful, such as BioLogic\'s Biomass All Legume and orginal Biomass as well as Tecomate\'s Buck Beans, and Lablab Plus.\nThere are also many other blends available at local feed and seed stores, but a word of caution: Always read the bag and make sure you want everything in it to grow on your property. I once had a client ""pick up his own seed"" and later found out that the main ingredient in the blend was brown-top millet, currently our second-most invasive weed on the entire property. Millet is great for birds and excellent at controlling erosion, but it does not belong in a warm season deer food plot designed for nutrition as it will choke out almost anything else you plant.\nI use the cereal grains in smaller acreage plots and as buffers, cover and travel corridors in larger plots. Any of them will work in these circumstances but remember that if you plant Round-Up-ready beans, and you\'re mixing them with a cereal grain, make sure it also is Round-Up-ready. These cereal grains do not provide deer with summer nutrition, but they do provide shade, bedding, and early fall nutrition in the form of fats and carbohydrates.\nThe height difference in these cereal grains as compared to the legumes is generally drastic, which creates an additional ""edge"" on the food plot that all types of wildlife can benefit from. Grain Sorghum and Egyptian Wheat are both better in drought conditions than corn and will generally hold seeds later into summer and early fall better since their seed is higher and out of the reach of squirrels and raccoons, both of which feast on early corn.\nLegumes (broadleafs) are the backbone of any spring/summer planting program. My favorites are Lablab, Eagle Seed Soybeans and Aeschynomene as stand alone plantings and Biomass All-Legume as a ready-to-plant blend. All of these species have to be either planted in large plots (greater than two acres) or protected throughout most of the South. They are highly attractive and nutritious, but in smaller plots, without protection, they will not be able to survive the browse pressure of our high deer densities. Moisture is a serious factor when choosing which legume to plant.\nLablab is one of the most drought tolerant legumes there is; it can survive on an inch or two of rain all season if planted correctly. Aeschynomene on the other hand can successfully grow underwater, so if your plot is in a low area that holds ground water close to the surface for extended periods it is the species for you. Aeschynomene also can take browse pressure better than most legumes, thus making it a viable consideration for smaller acreage plots in areas of high deer densities. Eagle Seed Soybeans are forage beans that are designed to produce mass quantities of leaves and do so very quickly once they are established.\nA client of mine had his Eagle leaves tested last summer by a lab and they tested out at 35 percent crude protein. There is no other legume that can make those claims. They are also Round-Up-ready, making them the go-to seed in areas where summer weeds are a significant problem. Eagle Seed soybeans do require more precipitation than Lablab but once established are quite drought tolerant.\nMost summer plots below the Mason-Dixon line can be planted by May 1, but I cannot emphasize enough the need to wait until rain is pending to plant. Moisture is the single most important factor in establishing successful summer food plots; without it the plants simply will not survive. If you can time your planting to occur just prior to a half-inch of rain or better, you will be amazed at how quickly the plots will germinate and grow. I\'ve seen Lablab germinate and have two leaves per plant within 48 hours of planting.\nThe cereal grains and legumes mentioned above should be planted about a half-inch deep but can be planted as deep as an inch. Unlike fall plots that can be ""rained"" into their seed beds, spring species need to be covered to ensure proper rooting. I use a Firminator to plant both spring and fall plots and adjust the angle of the front cutting discs to achieve my desired cover. This machine culti-packs the seed bed after dropping the seed into the dirt. A drag harrow can also be used in loose dirt to cover the seed followed by rolling or culti-packing to ensure good seed/soil contact.\nPerhaps the most important and often over-looked aspect of summer food plots is adequate protection against over-browsing. There are several options available to protect your food plots and I\'ve tried them all from using road barricades and barbershop clippings to full plot exclusion fences. Plot size is a good way to deal with browse pressure but is often not enough. This past spring, one of my clients planted a 10-acre soybean field in north Georgia and in three weeks time the entire field was all but eliminated. Fortunately for him, we were able to save the food plot by immediately installing a Gallagher fencing system around the field.\nThis allowed his soybeans to regenerate and thrive. You can protect your plots with visual, scent, sound or physical barriers that key on a deer\'s wariness to the advantage of your crop. Visual and sound barriers such as flashing lights, aluminum foil and propane cannons tend not to be very effective against southern deer.\nScent barriers such as Milorginte have been shown in studies to be effective when applied at a rate of 300 pounds per acre but can be costly and have a fixed efficacy of about 3-4 weeks. Two applications will cost about $110 per acre. Combination barriers like PlotSaver and Plot Protector tend to work well in medium deer densities, however they require reapplication of the scent product every 10 days to two weeks to be effective.\nPhysical barriers, however, can provide up to 100 percent exclusion from installation until removal and come in two different forms; high fences and electric fences. Most of my clients do not want to look at a rolled up high fence on their food plots during hunting season so they use electric fences.\nThe Gallagher electric fence system has provided us with greater than 95 percent exclusion in our summer food plots and often eliminates the need for herbicide in established plots because the food plot species, when not being browsed, will out-compete weeds for critical sunlight. Installation and take-down of this system can be done by one person with relative ease and the components can be stored until the following spring. Also, you can strategically remove the fence systems and place them on over-browsed plots, allowing them to recover while the deer are feeding in previously protected plots.\nAlthough there are many challenges in planting summer food plots in the South, by following the guidelines above for site preparation, seed selection, planting and protecting, you can be successful at growing and maintaining attractive and nutritious plots year after year. With a little time, money, sweat and blood coupled with a lot of ticks, chiggers, mosquitoes, gnats and no-see-ums, you\'ll have bachelor groups, nursing does, growing fawns and a host of other critters feasting and thriving on your land.']"	['<urn:uuid:aa9e841d-15a7-4864-964a-8fd04e346e0f>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	10	10	1953
28	bamboo processing in india northeast potential applications how much raw material unused	In Arunachal Pradesh, 70-80 percent of bamboo resources go to waste. Currently, only 5% is used for paper production and another 5% for furniture and building materials. The remaining bamboo could be processed at the first-of-its-kind biofuel refinery at Numaligarh Refinery in Assam. There are actually nearly 2000 different applications for bamboo, including artifacts, charcoal, engineered material, construction, fabric, automobile interiors, electronics, flooring, sports goods, food products, and medicine.	"[""A biofuel refinery, the first of its kind in India, set up at the Numaligarh Refinery (NRL) in Assam, will soon process biofuel from bamboo, abundantly found in Arunachal Pradesh, Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said recently.\nThe Arunachal Pradesh government has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with NRL for sourcing three lakh tonnes of bamboo per year from the frontier state, says an IANS report. Pradhan also assured Chief Minister Pema Khandu and Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju that the state's huge bamboo resources could be tapped to their true potential, which can change the economy of the rural masses.\nThe Petroleum Minister informed that only five percent of bamboo resources of the state are used for paper production, while another five percent goes in the manufacturing of furniture and other building materials.\nAround 70-80 percent of bamboo resources in Arunachal Pradesh go waste. We will tap them and the economy of bamboo farmers and the state would change, he explained.\nPradhan stated that a robust system for procurement of bamboo and preventing entry of middlemen should be put in place, reported Indian Express. He suggested setting up small bamboo processing units in rural hubs catering to a cluster of villages, which could be run by unemployed youths. NRL can then collect the processed bamboo from these units or the units can deliver it to Numaligarh, Pradhan said, calling for a structure like that of Amul.\nThe Union Minister said the ministry has come out with the Vision 2020 document that includes an intense roadmap for the northeast in oil and natural gas exploration, the extension of production, distribution, research, etc. He requested both Khandu and Rijiju to go through the document and plan accordingly. He proposed holding a high- level meeting in Arunachal Pradesh to sustainably harvest petroleum and natural gas resources in the state to augment revenue and employment generation. Pradhan hinted that he may visit Arunachal Pradesh in July. Pradhan also discussed CSR activities of oil and natural gas PSUs in Arunachal Pradesh. To the Chief Minister's request to extend and enhance CSR role in the state, he assured that he would check the present status and direct oil PSUs to do the needful. He said that critical and priority projects in social sectors, particularly in health and education, will be funded under CSR. Highlighting the ambitious Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojna (PMUY), the Union Minister said that by the end of 2019 every household in Arunachal Pradesh will be connected by LPG. He requested the Chief Minister and MoS Home Affairs to launch the scheme in the state and advised them to plan accordingly for it.\nPMUY, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May last year, aims to safeguard the health of women and children by providing them with clean cooking fuel—LPG—so that they don't have to compromise their health in smoky kitchens or wander in unsafe areas collecting firewood.\n- Narendra Modi\n- Prime Minister\n- natural gas\n- Dharmendra Pradhan\n- Arunachal Pradesh\n- Minister of State\n- Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas\n- Pema Khandu\n- Arunachal Pradesh government\n- natural gas exploration\n- natural gas resources\n- Natural Gas Minister\n- Petroleum Minister"", ""Glimpses of National Bamboo Mart 2015, Bhopal...read more\nWhat is Bamboo?\nAns: Bamboo is a woody grass.\nTotal number of species of bamboo in world?\nAns: There are total 100 genera and above 1400 species of bamboo in the world. .(Source: www.bambuseto.it/en/bamboo/the-plant)\nTotal number of species of bamboo in India?\nAns: There are 18 genera and 127 species in India.

It makes bamboo dark in color and increases softness.\nWhat are the uses of carbonized bamboo?\nAns: It is used in flooring and furniture.\nWhat are running bamboo?\nAns: Running bamboo spread very fast through their roots and rhizomes. It spreads widely underground and generate new culms come up on surface. It is also known as Monopodial Bamboo.\nWhat are clumping bamboo?\nAns: These types of bamboos spread slowly and the rhizomes increase root mass gradually. It is also known as Sympodial Bamboo.\nCan bamboo grow indoors?\nAns: Most bamboo doesn’t like the dry air indoor environments provide; still, some will grow fairly well.\nDoes bamboo shed a lot?\nAns: Bamboo will drop a few leaves gradually throughout the season, but never all at once like deciduous trees.\nHow deep do the roots go?\nAns: Bamboo roots are thin and fibrous (think big grass roots) and can go down 2-3 feet.\nIs bamboo planting sustainable?\nAns: Yes, it is a fast renewable growing species, it also requires less water.\nWhat do the size letters mean (A, B, C, D)?\nAns: In small ground cover bamboos the letters roughly relate to 1, 2, 3 and 5 gallon trade sizes.\nIn large size bamboos:\nA = 6 to 8 inch root ball with a 4 to 12 inch culm.\nB = 8 to 10 inch root ball with a 12 to 36 inch culm.\nC = 10 to 12 inch root ball with a 4 to 6 foot culm.\nD = 10 to 14 inch root ball with a 10 to 12 foot culm.\nWhat is hardwood flooring?\nAns: hardwood flooring is done with timber. It is expensive, and the timber requires a lot of time to grow so its not sustainable\nWhat is bamboo flooring?\nAns: Bamboo flooring is an environmentally friendly product. Bamboo is actually harder than many other species so it makes more durable flooring, also it is less expensive.\nWhat kind of fertilizer do you use?\nAns: For bamboo in the ground, organic fertilizer, such as mushroom compost, aged horse manure, fish meal, feather meal, or blood meal are all good options. For a commercial fertilizer that can be broadcast on top, and for bamboo in pots, we use a slow-release turf fertilizer\nCan metal be used as a bamboo barrier?\nAns: It’s a little better choice than cement, but metal conducts heat and cold, which means it will bake the bamboo roots in the summer and freeze them in the winter, which will hurt the bamboo; it also can rust and leach chemicals\nIs bamboo drought tolerant?\nAns: Clumpers are more drought tolerant than runners because they root fairly deep, but runners have higher tolerance of dry, hot air. In particular, Semiarundinaria fastuosa, Phyllostachys decora, P. aurea, and P. glauca ‘Yunzhu’ are very tolerant of dry, desert climates.\nIs bamboo harmful to pets?\nAns: No. Animals will often chew on it, but the leaves are actually rather nutritious and totally non-toxic.\nHow much water does bamboo require?\nAns: Ideally, about an inch a week, the same as a law (in 1-3 applications per week). In many climates, after the bamboo has been in the ground for 3-5 years, water is no longer necessary for survival.\nWhat kinds of pests and diseases can bamboo get?\nAns: Bamboo is usually pest-free; however some species are prone to aphids. There is also a bamboo mite, an import from Asia that can damage the leaves. However, as the mite is not native and is spread only by bamboo-to-bamboo contact, as long as your bamboo doesn’t have them and your neighbor’s bamboo doesn’t have them, odds are you’ll never have any problems. Both of these issues are usually more cosmetic than a real threat to the plant.\nWhich bamboo has the strongest wood?\nAns: Phyllostachysedulis is usually used for flooring and scaffolding; P. bambusoides is used for furniture and instruments (as it is both strong and flexible), and Guadua angustifolia is used for building construction. P. nigra ‘Henon’ and P. atrovaginata also have strong wood and straight canes.\nWhich Clumping Bamboos is fully sun tolerant?\nAns: Most hardy clumpers are shade loving plants, but there are a few that can tolerate more sun than others. Thamnocalamustesselatus actually flourishes in full in in the PNW, but may require some shade if grown in an area that commonly has high humidity in the summer\nWhat are the benefits of bamboo flooring?\nAns: Bamboo flooring is rapidly becoming one of the most popular types of residential flooring. Here are a few reasons why you should choose a bamboo floor:\n• Bamboo floors are easy to clean.\n• Bamboo floors are ideal for allergy sufferers as they do not promote dust or harbor dust mites.\n• Bamboo flooring is an inexpensive alternative to hardwood flooring, usually costing 25% to 50% less than hardwood.\n• Bamboo flooring is long-lasting. The laminate floors sold by BuildDirect come with 10-year and 25-year warranties.\n“What is the difference between “horizontal” and “vertical” bamboo flooring?\nAns: The terms “horizontal” and “vertical” refer to the manner in which bamboo strips are laminated together. In the horizontal style, the strips are laid flat so the top surface shows the bamboo’s natural growth rings, or “knuckles.” In the vertical style, the strips are turned on their sides and laminated together in long, slender rows creating a different appearance.\nCarbonized bamboo flooring stained?\nAns: No. Carbonized bamboo is darker in color because it has undergone a change, not a stain. During the manufacturing of the product, the strips of bamboo are boiled and change color (becoming browner in tone). This process also softens the material.\nCan bamboo hedge be grown?\nAns: yes, bamboo has traditionally been utilized to create screens and hedge, and even windbreaks.\nWhy is it important to prune bamboo?\nAns: bamboo pruning is done in order to increase its growth, it is generally done after 1 year when bamboo starts to leaf out.\nWhat is the objective of National Bamboo Mission?\nAns: To promote the growth of the bamboo sector and to promote marketing of bamboo based handicraft.( http://nbm.nic.in/objecte.html)\nHow the bamboo is propagated?\nAns: Bamboo can be propagated by\nWhat is the water requirement during summer season?\nAns: 25-30 litters\nWhat is the germination % of bamboo seeds?\nAns: 60 -80 %\nName the varieties used for sandy soil, red soil and laterite soil?\nAns: Dendrocalamus strictus, Bambusa bambos.\nAre bamboo and rattan (cane) the same?\nAns : No, bamboo and rattan belong to separate botanical family and they have separate properties.\nWhat is a bamboo shoot?\nAns: A bamboo shoot is a young Culm harvested at the time, or shortly after it appears above the soil surface for consumption purpose, as it is rich in nutrients and fibers.\nAnimals which depends on bamboo?\nAns: Many animals like Giant Panda, Red Panda , lesser Bamboo Lemur, Mountain Gorilla and south china bamboo bat.\nWhy bamboo dies after flowering?\nAns: The energy exerted by bamboo plants is tremendously high that they can't recover back, hence they die.\nIs transit pass required for bamboo in MP?\nAns: Transit Pass is required only for Dendrocalamus strictus in MP, not applicable to other species.\nHow many bamboo species are available in MP?\nAns: The predominant species of bamboo in Madhya Pradesh are Dendrocalamus strictus—called ‘desi bans’, found in nearly 80% of natural forests, and Bambusa bambos—called ‘katang bans’ and found in 80% of private bamboo clumps. Other species include Bambusa vulgaris var. striata, Cephalastachym pergracile, Gigantochloa rostrata, Schizostachyum pergracile, Bambusa tulda, Bambusa polymorpha, Bambusa nutans, Dendrocalamus asper, Bambusa balcooa and Melocanna baccifera.\nAreas in which MPSBM can help ?\nAns: MPSBM focus on four major areas:\nBamboo Production in natural and private lands\nUnder this, farmers can take benefit of Kisan Baans Yojana wherein they can avail 10 bamboo saplings from the respective forest division office of MP.

The stakeholders can apply for the award by sending us mail at www.mpbamboomission.org\nI am a farmer who wish to plant bamboo in my farmland, from where can I collect bamboo saplings?\nAns: For bamboo sapling, you can communicate with MP State Bamboo Mission. We will try our best to provide you the saplings from the concerned nursery or else we will provide you with the contact details of the supplier\nFor Tissue Culture saplings of Beema Bamboo you can communicate with Dr N. Barathi, Director, Growmore Biotech Ltd, Husur, Tamil Nadu.\nHow many uses of bamboo are there?\nAns: There are nearly 2000 applications of bamboo.\nWhat are the schemes of MPSBM?\nAns: MPSBM has formulated Kisan bans Yojana for promoting bamboo outside forest land and making it a remunerative business for farmers.\nDoes bamboo create any socio- economic significance in life of rural India?\nAns: Bamboo also forms an important forest produce with high significance in socio-economic life of rural MP. Harvesting of bamboo from natural forests generates every year employment of about 2.25 million man days equal to Rs.112.5 million wage earning. One hectare of bamboo plantation can produce 200 man days of employment and 900 man days in cottage industry with the raw material from this plantation.\nAre bamboos good tool for alleviating poverty in MP?\nAns: In Madhya Pradesh, there are two main consumers of bamboo, namely, basod (bamboo artisans) and nistar (usufruct for farmers). The total domestic requirement of bamboo by the villagers including basods has been estimated to be 1870 lakh. If the actual demand for basods or nistar can be met, for example if basods are provided with 908 bamboos per family (average demand) or 1500 bamboo per family as per Nistar policy then 51.42% and 77.38% family would go above poverty line respectively. Similarly for, Nistar, if supply of bamboo could be increased to 167 (actual demand) or to 250 bamboos per family, which is the quantity as per nistar policy, the percentage of families who are living below poverty line will change from 72% to 69% and 66% respectively.\n(Source for q-105-111: Primary Survey results, Paper by P.B.

29	muscle gain extra protein daily requirement	To add one pound of muscle, the body needs an additional 10 to 14 grams of protein per day, which is equivalent to one cup of plain, whole yogurt or 2 fried eggs.	['This summer, my 12-year-old played four or more hours of baseball including fitness training every day. During this stretch, he developed a new interest in building muscle and spent a lot of time admiring his developing six-pack abs. He argued that he needed extra protein to fuel his workouts and build his muscles, and proposed buying protein powders like the ones advertised on ESPN. I agreed with him that his body required more nutrients during this period of intensified training than it would on a lazy summer day, but I disagreed that the solution was a chemical protein powder.\nHow much protein do kids really need?\nThe Institute of Medicine recommends a daily allowance of:\n- 34 grams for 13-year-old children\n- 46 grams for girls ages 14 to 18\n- 52 grams for boys ages 14 to 18\nSome protein powders provide 80 grams of protein per serving. This is considerably more than a growing child needs in one day, let alone in one serving.\nImagine what that child might eat in one day: An ideal breakfast might be a cup of whole yogurt with fruit and granola (10 grams of protein); lunch could be a cup of bean chili with a sliced avocado (18 grams of protein), followed by dinner of three ounces of chicken, one cup of brown rice and a serving of green beans (30 grams of protein). That child just consumed 58 grams of whole-food protein so he surely doesn’t need to supplement his diet with a processed powder.\nYet, what if — like my son — your child wants to build extra muscle?\nBarbara Lewin, a dietitian and sports nutritionist who has worked with professional and Olympic athletes, explains, “To add one pound of muscle, the body needs a additional 10 grams to 14 grams of protein per day.” That’s what comes in one cup of plain, whole yogurt or 2 fried eggs. If your child is already eating three balanced meals and perhaps a nutritious snack, he might already be getting those extra grams.\nProtein powders therefore seem unwarranted, especially when too much protein can have the undesirable affect of stressing the kidneys and liver and possibly interfering in the body’s ability to absorb calcium. To boot, excess protein is often converted into fat instead of transforming into muscle mass. One study has also shown that as protein intake increases, so does a body’s need for water, so if your children are increasing their daily protein, be sure they drink more water.\nVarieties of protein powders\nProtein powders can be made from different ingredients; the most common are whey, casein, soy, pea, rice and hemp. Each variety carries its own pros and cons. For instance, whey is a complete protein that is easily digested and absorbed into the bloodstream. Whey protein concentrate is preferable to whey protein isolate. Yet, whey and casein proteins are both derived from dairy so people who are lactose intolerant may have a difficult time digesting them. Soy is a potential allergen and a majority of the soy in the United States has been genetically modified, which can be a health concern. Pea, rice and hemp are not complete proteins so are best used to supplement other sources of whole-food protein instead of as a meal replacement.\nThe downside of protein powders\nNothing is wrong with supplementing a balanced diet with the occasional smoothie that includes a scoop of protein powder. The danger arises when someone, especially a growing youth, uses these powders instead of eating enough whole foods.\nAdditional risks emerge when a teen consumes large volumes of these processed powders. Many are loaded with sugar and unhealthful ingredients such as artificial flavorings, artificial sweeteners, untested herbs, antibiotics, and heavy metals. Many are not even regulated by the FDA. Both Consumer Reports and ConsumerLab.com have conducted independent tests uncovering that many brands contain toxic chemicals and other undisclosed ingredients, while other brands were found guilty of exaggerating the amount of nutrients they supply.\nChoosing a protein powder\nWhen buying a protein powder, look for these characteristics:\n- Few ingredients and additives. The ideal protein powder would include just the main protein source and nothing else. In other words, a whey protein powder would include whey protein concentrate as the sole ingredient, and a pea protein powder would list peas as the only ingredient. Also, don’t fall for sales gimmicks that advertise extra vitamins, super foods or probiotics in a powder. Chances are the small amounts of these added benefits render them ineffective.\n- Free of sugar and artificial sweeteners.\n- Low in heavy metals and toxins. Small amounts of heavy metals are inevitable in our food supply, but consuming a product that contains heavy metals on a daily basis (or in some cases many times a day) can be damaging.\n- Organic and non-GMO.\n- A GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) label verifying that the product was manufactured in a facility following best industry standards and therefore discloses all ingredients.\nBewareof the lure of “energy” as powders advertised as such might include caffeine-containing ingredients (coffee, cocoa, guarana, and mate) that stimulate yet don’t actually provide long-lasting energy.\nAnd be wary of the promise of natural flavors. The FDA allows something to be labeled “natural” if the original source is a natural product, even though undisclosed items may be added to that natural product during processing. For instance, in order to remove oils from the soy, hemp, rice or peas so they don’t turn rancid on the shelves, the grains and beans are often treated using chemicals that may remain on the food.\nA better idea\nI’ve seen the advertisements that portray big muscles and protein powders as awfully appealing, and I see why my boys fall prey to them; yet there are healthier alternatives to help kids get the nutrients they need while healthfully building muscle. A smoothie packed with one of the following whole food proteins offers vitamins, minerals and healthful fats, and quite possibly puts any chemically-powdered shake to shame.\n- Nut or seed butters\n- Raw seeds or nuts\n- Ground flaxseeds, chia seeds or hemp seeds\n- Whole yogurt\n- Coconut milk (5 grams of protein per cup)\n- Raw oats soaked overnight in water then drained (6 grams of protein per cup)\n- Raw cacao nibs (4 grams of protein per 1 ounce serving plus antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals)\n- Dark leafy greens such as spinach (5 grams of protein per cup plus vitamins, minerals and chlorophyll)\n- An avocado (4 grams of protein plus healthful fats)\nFirst published in the Washington Post on Thursday, September 24, 2015.']	['<urn:uuid:ed7993bd-a5fe-4557-be07-f6e5eb9ce8ff>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	6	33	1104
30	global funding family planning decrease since 1995	Global funding for family planning and reproductive health care decreased by 30 percent between 1995 and 2008. This decline was largely due to legislative pressure from the religious right in the USA and elsewhere.	['The current global development model is unsustainable, but it can be fixed. These are the findings of a distinguished group of laureates of the Asahi Glass Foundation’s Blue Planet Prize who contributed to the recent report, “Environment and Development Challenges: The Imperative to Act.” Since the prize was established in the year of the Rio Earth Summit (1992), recipients have included the likes of Gro Harlem Brundtland, Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute, Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University, Bunker Roy of Barefoot College and Will Turner of Conservation International.\nRapid population growth and excessive consumption lay at the heart of the challenges to sustainable development. According to the report, “Civilization is faced with a perfect storm of problems driven by overpopulation, overconsumption by the rich, the use of environmentally malign technologies, and gross inequalities.”\nThis is not to discount the role that economic development has played in lifting billions of people out of extreme poverty and improving living standards around the world. The laureates point to the economic emergence of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) as “a major success story.”\nRather, the report emphasizes that unsustainable behavior and increasing inequality will impede future development and even threaten to take back some of the gains that have already been made. While the per capita emissions of developed countries are far higher, the energy intensive development of the BRIC countries, “is associated with a significant increase in their GHG emissions (particularly CO2) … from 15 to 35 percent of global emissions over the last 60 years.”\nThe complexities of the problem make it hard to grasp and far too easy to ignore: “The human ability to do has vastly outstripped the ability to understand.”\nEnergy and Climate Change\nHuman-induced climate change is primarily a result of the way the world has chosen to produce and use energy. Climate-altering fossil fuels account for some 90 percent of global energy needs, excluding some 12 percent of energy that comes from “traditionally scavenged biomass” like coal, wood and peat.\nMore compelling facts from the report put the issue in better perspective: “The global population, which has now passed 7 billion people, and the average per capita energy consumption have both increased sevenfold over the past 150 years, for an overall fifty-fold increase in the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.” In the laureates’ assessment, thus far, “The global community’s attempts to address climate change have been hopelessly inadequate.”\nThe report traces the crux of many energy issues to market failures and misaligned incentives. Inefficient, environmentally damaging subsidies and tax codes have long favored fossil fuels at the expense of renewable energy alternatives.\nBiodiversity and Ecosystem Services\n“Two-thirds of ecosystem services are currently being degraded globally, which will soon amount to an estimated loss of $500 billion annually in benefits,” according to the report.\nBiodiversity “runs human life-support systems.” The essential ecosystem services of biodiversity include: 1) providing food, water, fiber and fuel; 2) regulating climate, floods and diseases; and 3) offering aesthetic, spiritual, educational and recreational cultural benefits.\nCostly biodiversity losses and the impairment of ecosystem services are driven by: 1) the conversion and irresponsible use of natural habitats; 2) excessive exploitation of the earth’s limited and declining supply of natural resources; 3) the introduction of exotic species in places where they do not belong; and 4) human-induced climate change.\nCorrecting market failures that underestimate or entirely exclude the full economic and social value of biodiversity and ecosystem services is a “particularly urgent and important” component of a new model for sustainable development.\nMore than one billion people still go to bed hungry each night. The need to increase agricultural productivity while reducing the ecological footprint of food production is a key challenge of meeting the increasing global demand for food, which is expected to double in the next 25 to 50 years. The laureates advocate a worthy objective: “The Right to Food should become a basic human right; a combination of political will, farmers’ skill and scientists’ commitment will be needed to achieve this goal.”\nRegardless of climate change, over half the world’s population is projected to live in areas of severe water stress by 2025. Fifty to sixty percent of wetlands have already been lost. Global warming will only contribute to expediting and exacerbating the challenges to the world’s water sources.\nIssues of food and resource security raise the risk of human conflict. The map below shows areas of recent and potential future conflicts related to water scarcity, demography, crop decline, hunger and coastal risk.\nWomen’s Health and Demographics\nGlobal funding for family planning and reproductive health care, which are central to the well-being of poor girls and women in developing countries, decreased by 30 percent between 1995 and 2008. The laureates pull no punches by positing the decline is, “not least … a result of legislative pressure from the religious right in the USA and elsewhere.”\nThe Way Forward\nThe laureates call for immediate action on a number of fronts to address the urgency of the economic and development challenges at hand.\n- Value and Price in Environmental and Social Impacts – “The value of ecosystem services and natural capital must be incorporated in national accounting and decision-making processes across all sectors of society.” Factoring the full value of biodiversity and ecosystem services into decisions about energy production and use is a critical component of transitioning from climate-changing fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.\n- Grow Green – Low-carbon, green growth is “the only sound basis for a sustainable recovery” from the prolonged economic slowdown in developed countries. If existing barriers are lowered and technologies scaled up accordingly, “the share of renewable energy in global primary energy could increase to 30 to 75 percent.”\n- Empower Girls and Women – Involving girls and women makes development efforts more effective, improves well-being and reduces inequality. Women have critical parts to play in increasing agricultural productivity and managing the environment. The report observes, “The next major increment of global well-being could well come from the full empowerment of women.”\n- Adapt to Climate Change – Climate change is real and inevitable. Even in the best case scenarios, countries need to take action to minimize the threats to living environments and loss of economic opportunities.\n- Define and Operationalize Sustainability – The report points out that a clear, working definition and set of guiding principles for pursuing sustainability is “mandatory” for evaluating tradeoffs, calculating potentials and impacts and cooperating across sectors and disciplines.\n- Cooperate Regionally – Regional cooperation has often proven more effective than more expansive global cooperation efforts. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is cited as an example of a regional grouping of countries that has developed a common vision and interests which can facilitate the pursuit of sustainable development. Successful regional efforts can also “grow into global building blocks.”\n- Mainstream Grass Roots Action and Solutions – The report calls attention to the success that community groups, often in poor, rural areas, have had with influencing regional and national policy since Rio 1992. Their efforts have also yielded valuable lessons, “if only we have the humility and ability to listen.” Among them, the answer to addressing poverty and climate change is primarily social rather than technical. In India, discontent with government inaction led to Public Hearings and Social Audits that now benefit nearly 600,000 villages. Grass roots groups have also used South-South partnerships to transfer “traditional knowledge, village skills and practical wisdom” between communities and across continents that have had “an incredible impact on improving the quality of life.”\nTime for Change\nThe challenge of addressing the real risks to sustainable development is exacerbated by an irrational, short-sided belief in the “perpetual growth myth.” Particularly in developed countries, too many people continue to blindly trust that economic expansion will somehow resolve the unpleasant issues of the day.\nThe laureates beg to differ that, “Either we will change our ways and build an entirely new kind of global society, or they will be changed for us.” Fortunately, they offer hope that sustainable, equitable development “is an achievable dream” provided we are willing and able to make fundamental changes to the way things have been done so far.\nRelated articles and content:']	['<urn:uuid:473172ca-2335-4430-bbd0-f47dae6a1b6b>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	7	34	1377
31	cooking frozen foods versus thawed time duration comparison	When cooking frozen foods compared to thawed foods, cooking time will be approximately 50% longer. For example, if a thawed chicken breast takes 30 minutes to cook, a frozen one will take 45 minutes.	['The Best Fluffy Pancakes recipe you will fall in love with. Full of tips and tricks to help you make the best pancakes.\nYou don’t have to thaw food. It just makes most meats cook quicker and more evenly. If it takes you 30 minutes to cook a thawed chicken breast, it’ll take you 45 to cook a frozen one. You also don’t have to thaw frozen vegetables: Just cook them straight from the package.\nCan you cook frozen food without defrosting?\nYes, it is 100% safe to cook foods without thawing. Foods can safely go from the freezer to the oven. The best results may or may not be reached, depending on the food involved, but it is safe.\nDo you have to defrost before cooking?\nFood should be thoroughly defrosted before cooking (unless the manufacturer’s instructions tell you to cook from frozen or you have a proven safe method). If food is still frozen or partially frozen, it will take longer to cook.\nWhy do you have to defrost frozen food before cooking?\nUsually the cooking process will require a lower temperature to defrost the food and then a higher temperature for a longer time to cook it through. However some foods cannot be cooked from frozen and must be thawed fully before use. … This increases the risk of harmful bacteria contaminating the food.\nCan you cook frozen food?\nIt is perfectly safe to cook meats from frozen. Cooking time will be approximately 50% longer than the recommended time for fully thawed or fresh meat and poultry. For more information on thawing, visit the USDA website.\nCan you sear a frozen roast?\nThe reverse sear method is easy, almost foolproof, and you can start directly from frozen. Plus it will give you the most amazing, tender meat, cooked perfectly all the way through and with a great crispy crust.\nCan meat be left out overnight to defrost?\nA lot of bacteria grows in the range of 40-100°F (4-38°C) (ie room temperature). It’s definitely not recommended to defrost meat at room temperature. In fact, you are not supposed to leave meat at room temperature for more than an hour. … You grab a package of meat or chicken and use hot water to thaw it fast.\nCan you cook fish from frozen?\nYou can skip the thawing process altogether and cook frozen fish straight from the freezer. You’ll have to add a few minutes to the cook time in your recipe to account for the lack of thawing, but you can poach, steam, bake, broil or grill fish straight from the freezer!\nCan you cook chicken if still a little frozen?\nAccording to the USDA, yes, you can safely cook your frozen chicken, as long as you follow a couple general guidelines. In order to skip the thawing step and turn your frozen chicken into a fully-cooked, safe-to-eat dinner, use your oven or stove top and simply increase your cooking time by at least 50%.\nCan you cook liver from frozen?\nOne of the great things about lambs liver is that if you have frozen it ready prepared and chopped up, then you don’t even need to defrost it for many recipes! Just take a portion out of the freezer and pop it into a frying pan and fry it up.\nHow do you grill a frozen steak without thawing it?\nThe key lies in setting up a two-level fire, placing the frozen steaks directly over the primary heat source for about 7 minutes per side, until they’re nice and browned all over. Once they have a beautiful crust on them, it’s time to let indirect heat handle the rest and move them 6 inches away from the heat source.\nHow can I defrost beef quickly?\nFor days when what to make for dinner is the last thing on your mind, you can use the microwave to quickly defrost ground beef. Remove all packaging, then place the meat on a plate and microwave it at 50% power for 2 to 3 minutes, rotating and flipping the beef every 45 seconds, until it is fully thawed.']	['<urn:uuid:466d11f1-386c-4fb5-8eb9-f205703480fa>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	8	34	687
32	How do stable and unstable isotopes help study Earth's past?	Stable isotopes can be used to understand various geochemical and geobiological processes through their fractionation patterns. Unstable (radioactive) isotopes naturally decay at constant rates from 'parent' to 'daughter' elements, allowing dating of rocks and minerals. This decay process continues until the number of protons and neutrons becomes balanced and the atom stabilizes. The analysis of both stable and radiogenic isotope signatures helps trace the source of minerals, rocks and fluids, and can be used to calculate epsilon values for understanding material origins.

This method is useful for igneous and metamorphic rocks, which cannot be dated by the stratigraphic correlation method used for sedimentary rocks. Over naturally-occurring isotopes are known. Some do not change with time and form stable isotopes i. The unstable or more commonly known radioactive isotopes break down by radioactive decay into other isotopes.\nRadioactive decay is a natural process and comes from the atomic nucleus becoming unstable and releasing bits and pieces. These are released as radioactive particles there are many types. This decay process leads to a more balanced nucleus and when the number of protons and neutrons balance, the atom becomes stable. This radioactivity can be used for dating, since a radioactive 'parent' element decays into a stable 'daughter' element at a constant rate.\nFor geological purposes, this is taken as one year. Another way of expressing this is the half-life period given the symbol T. The half-life is the time it takes for half of the parent atoms to decay. The relationship between the two is: Many different radioactive isotopes and techniques are used for dating. All rely on the fact that certain elements particularly uranium and potassium contain a number of different isotopes whose half-life is exactly known and therefore the relative concentrations of these isotopes within a rock or mineral can measure the age.\nFor an element to be useful for geochronology measuring geological timethe isotope must be reasonably abundant and produce daughter isotopes at a good rate. Either a whole rock or a single mineral grain can be dated. Some techniques place the sample in a nuclear reactor first to excite the isotopes present, then measure these isotopes using a mass spectrometer such as in the argon-argon scheme. Others place mineral grains under a special microscope, firing a laser beam at the grains which ionises the mineral and releases the isotopes.\nThe isotopes are then measured within the same machine by an attached mass spectrometer an example of this is SIMS analysis. This is a common dating method jeu speed dating letheia used by archaeologists, as it can only date geologically recent organic materials, usually charcoal, but also bone and antlers. All living organisms take up carbon from their environment including a small proportion of the radioactive isotope 14C formed from nitrogen as a result of cosmic ray bombardment.\nThe amount of carbon isotopes within living organisms reaches an equilibrium value, on death no more is taken up, and the what is radioactive dating and how is it used to tell the age of materials present starts to decay at a known rate. The amount of 14C present and the known rate of decay of 14C and the equilibrium value gives the length what is radioactive dating and how is it used to tell the age of materials time elapsed since the death of the organism.\nThis method faces problems because the cosmic ray flux has changed over time, but a calibration factor is applied to take this into account. Radiocarbon dating is normally suitable for organic materials less than 50 years old because beyond that time the amount of 14C becomes too small to be accurately measured. This scheme what is radioactive dating and how is it used to tell the age of materials developed in but became more useful when mass spectrometers were improved in the late s and early s.\nHowever, both Rb and Sr easily follow fluids that move through rocks or escape during some types of metamorphism. This technique is less used now. The dual decay of potassium K to 40Ar argon and 40Ca calcium was worked out between and This technique has become more widely used since the late s. Its great advantage is that most rocks contain potassium, usually locked up in feldspars, clays and amphiboles. However, potassium is very mobile during metamorphism and alteration, and so this technique is not used much for old rocks, but is useful for rocks of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras, particularly unaltered igneous rocks.\nThis technique developed in the late s but came into vogue in the early s, through step-wise release of the isotopes. This technique uses the same minerals and rocks as for K-Ar dating but restricts measurements to the argon isotopic system which is not so affected by metamorphic and alteration events. It is used for very old to very young rocks. The decay of Sm to Nd for dating rocks began in the mids and was widespread by the early s. It is useful for dating very old igneous and metamorphic rocks and also meteorites and other cosmic fragments.\nHowever, there is a limited range in Sm-Nd isotopes in many igneous rocks, although metamorphic rocks that contain the mineral garnet are useful as this mineral has a large range in Sm-Nd isotopes. This technique also helps in determining the composition and evolution of the Earth's mantle and bodies in the universe. The Re-Os isotopic system was first developed in the early s, but recently has been improved for accurate age determinations.\nThe main limitation is that it only works on certain igneous rocks as most rocks have insufficient Re and Os or lack evolution of the isotopes. This technique is good for iron meteorites and the mineral molybdenite. This system is highly favoured for accurate dating of igneous and metamorphic rocks, through many different techniques. It was used by the beginning of the s, but took until the early s to produce accurate ages of rocks.\nThe great advantage is that almost all igneous and metamorphic rocks contain sufficient U and Pb for this dating. It can be used on powdered whole rocks, mineral concentrates isotope dilution technique or single grains SHRIMP technique. The SHRIMP Sensitive High Resolution Ion MicroProbe technique was developed at the Research School of Earth Sciences, Australian National University, Canberra in the early s.\nIt has revolutionised age dating using the U-Pb isotopic system. Using the SHRIMP, selected areas of growth on single grains of zircon, baddeleyite, sphene, rutile and monazite can be accurately dated to less than years in some cases. It can even date nonradioactive minerals when they contain inclusions of zircons and monazite, as in sapphire grains.""]"	['<urn:uuid:1b402139-ccee-41af-b635-41a7bb594d3a>', '<urn:uuid:1c7f3af6-6f41-4f90-980d-88fc098ecedc>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	10	82	1687
33	eco friendly floor materials carbon footprint transport distance renewable resources	While materials like bamboo, cork, and hardwood are renewable resources, their environmental impact also depends on transport distance. For optimal environmental impact, it's recommended to choose products made or grown within 500 miles to reduce CO2 emissions and transportation energy costs. For example, bamboo's green benefits are somewhat offset by its transport from the Pacific Rim. Similarly, stone, while natural and recyclable, may impact the environment during transportation due to its weight.	"['Do you want a green floor that does not subject the environment to risk and is manufactured in a friendly manner? Well, there are plenty of Phoenix flooring options that are considered green, and are made from natural or renewable substances. However, the mode of manufacture is not the only factor that affects the environment friendliness of Phoenix flooring. There are other things to consider as well which also impact the environment such as maintenance, transport distance, life cycle, toxicity and so on.\nHere are some materials that are considered the greenest of all Phoenix flooring options.\nCork is a natural and renewable material that is made from an oak tree’s bark. The bark used is the one which grows after the tree has already been harvested. Cork insulates heat and cold, and so helps in maintaining a fixed temperature in the room. It also prevents growth of mold, mites, and bugs.\nThe average price of cork is around $1.50 to $4 per square feet.\nLinoleum is a material that is manufactured from linseed oil, obtained from flax plants. It is produced in a manner which does not have any serious negative impact on the environment. Moreover, once it has been used, it can easily be burnt and utilized as fuel. This produces energy which is almost the same as that required to produce linoleum. Thus, the lifecycle of linoleum is an almost complete closed loop system.\nLinoleum is a durable material and can see as much as 40 years in your house; the average price is around $2 to $5.\nBamboo is one of the most popular Phoenix flooring options. The plant grows at a very rapid pace and can be harvested in just about three years, which makes it a renewable material. This is a good feature but it is somewhat mitigated by the fact that bamboo is mostly produced in the Pacific Rim and so pollution may be created as it is imported to your region. But other than this, bamboo is a green material and since the costs incurred are not excessive, it is used abundantly. The average price of bamboo flooring is about $2 to $5.\nHardwood is a product that is naturally produced by the Earth and is constantly renewed. Hardwood is biodegradable and once its lifetime is over, it can be reconciled and utilized as fuel. It can also be used for other Phoenix flooring projects after some treatment.\nThe average price of hardwood floors lies in the range between $3 and $12 per square feet.\nStone is another natural product of the Earth that is a result of the tectonic process. Stone has no harms on the environment and can easily be recycled. The only issue is that the material is heavy and may impact the environment while being transported from one place to another.\nOther than its green properties, natural stone is a great choice for Phoenix flooring because of its attractive colors. The average price is around $7, but some natural stones can cost as much as $35 per square feet.', ""Reduce. Reuse. Recycle. Respect.\nThe World Floor Covering Association (WFCA) teamed up with The Learning Channel’s Designing Spaces to produce a segment on green, environmentally friendly floors. It’s a great introduction to the concept of green flooring and to some of the choices available to eco-friendly homeowners.\nFor many of us, awareness of our individual impact on the life of our planet is just coming into focus. Recent initiatives by local utility companies, local builders and local and national governmental agencies have served to heighten awareness of every human being’s impact on the global environment. “Greening” our homes is a wonderful investment. The impact can be felt immediately within our own families and what’s good for us is good for our planet and future generations.\nGoing green, according to the U.S. Green Building Council, means looking at these factors when building or remodeling our homes:\n- Energy savings\n- Water efficiency\n- CO2 emissions reduction\n- Improved indoor environmental quality\n- Stewardship of resources and sensitivity to their impacts.\nSaving energy may mean choosing a natural flooring that requires little energy to produce; buying locally so that transportation energy is minimal; choosing flooring with no or low VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) emissions because they can contribute to health problems; or choosing flooring that is made from renewable resources.\nEvery little step counts. And rest assured there are many flooring choices that will contribute to the notion of leaving our planet just as beautiful as it was when we arrived, so that our children and our children’s children can enjoy it as much as we did.\nWorld Floor Covering Association and “Designing Spaces” Provide Tips on Creating Eco-Friendly Living Spaces\nEver wonder what makes a product “green”?\nGet all of the answers you need and more by tuning into The Learning Channel’s Designing Spaces cable program which features the World Floor Covering Association (WFCA) in a segment on green, environmentally friendly floors. You'll get an overview of every kind of eco-friendly flooring on the market from carpets made of corn sugar to bamboo area rugs. And, you can learn about what makes a product environmentally friendly as well as the carbon “footprint” a product leaves from the time and place it is sourced to final installation.\nClearly, going green goes beyond just choosing a green flooring type. Cleaning products, transportation and materials used for manufacturing and installation must be considered.\nGreen Tips for Adhesives:\n- Choose products with low to no VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds)\n- Avoid formaldehyde\n- Look for Carpet and Rug Institutes (CRI) Green Label® or Green Label Plus® certification\nGreen Tips for Cleaners:\n- Choose products with natural and biodegradable ingredients\n- Consider homemade cleaners using things from the pantry: vinegar, baking soda, salt, lemon juice, rubbing alcohol, ammonia, or olive oil\nGreen Tips for the Whole House:\n- Keep caulked areas caulked (caulking prevents the loss of heat or cold air)\n- If you are installing a new floor, make sure that space between the flooring and the door is just right (too much space means you’re heating or cooling the entire outdoors while too little space means you can’t close the door)\n- Consider that space heaters are energy hogs and can generate more than two pounds of greenhouse gas per hour (use them too much and they might make your hardwood floors contract)\n- Choose low or no VOC products whenever you can\n- Insulation is not just for the attic anymore, it can be added between floors for additional savings\n- Choose a retailer that shares your commitment to the environment and knows about all the latest advances in green products\nGreen flooring falls into at least one of these categories:\n- Sustainable (wood flooring)\n- Eco-friendly (bamboo area rugs)\n- Contains recycled content (rubber flooring)\n- Recyclable (vinyl flooring)\n- Leaves a small carbon footprint (wool carpeting)\n- Has low VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) (stone) It’s a matter of degree.\nWool, wood, fast growing bamboo, eucalyptus and cork are considered renewable resources because they can be re-grown and sustainably harvested.\nRecycled wood flooring is made from salvaged boards from old buildings slated for demolition or trees salvaged from lake bottoms that have been re-milled into a product suitable for your home.\nRecycled plastics from water and soda bottles can be added to the five billion pounds of carpet that is replaced annually and made into new carpet with all the attributes of virgin carpet.\nSalvaged or Reusable Materials\nOld stone floors can be salvaged and reused in a new setting.\nOther Green Factors\nSave transportation energy costs and reduce CO2 emissions by choosing products made or grown within 500 miles.\nVOCs are human-made chemicals that are used and produced in the manufacture of paints, industrial solvents, paint thinners and adhesives, among many other things. VOCs are one of the building blocks of smog. They can be toxic to the nervous system and some are cancer causing.\nIt’s important to choose water-based adhesives and finishes over solvent-based ones. Here’s a guide to help you out.\nChoose durable floors that are low-maintenance. Extending the life of your floor means replacing it less often and as a result, creating less waste.\nChoose floors that can be cleaned and maintained without the use of harsh chemicals.\nChoose floors that don’t have to be refinished or resealed often.\nEnd of Life\nChoose floors that can be recycled, reused or will naturally decompose. (Generally speaking, synthetic flooring will not decompose, but can be recycled.)""]"	['<urn:uuid:665dba9d-bf8e-4421-83d0-797f1b0d25ae>', '<urn:uuid:3813768f-d295-4304-b284-4e4f8a24b349>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	10	72	1427
34	minimum tank size goldfish water changes frequency requirements	For goldfish, the minimum tank size starts at 20 gallons for one fish plus 10 gallons for each additional fish, with a school of six fish requiring 55-75 gallons. Regarding water changes, they should be done weekly with 25-50% of water changed to maintain nitrate levels below 40ppm, with 20ppm being a better standard. For pond maintenance, it's recommended to do 10-20% water changes every 1-2 weeks when ammonia levels are elevated.	['GOLDFISH IN THE AQUARIUM\nGoldfish, Carassius auratus auratus, are one of the if not the most popular aquarium fish ever. Most fishkeepers get involved with fishkeeping with goldfish. Unfortunately most of the time they start with a ten-gallon aquarium at best. Many features make these fish a good choice, but there are certain needs that need to be fulfilled. This article will focus on fancy goldfish, the round-bodied varieties.\nOne of the major issues, and most often over-looked, is tank size. These fish get much larger than the little one-inch babies swimming around the dealer’s tanks. There is some variation in size based on breed. In general they can reach fist size for their body alone, not including their fins. That is a large fish compared to what most people bring home. They are also schooling fish. They like the company of other goldfish, so a school should be established. A school is usually a minimum of six fish. One of the best guides for determining minimum tank size for goldfish is to start with 20 gallons for one and add an additional 10 gallons for each additional fish. This puts the minimum tank size for a school of goldfish in the 55-75 gallon range, and bigger is always better.\nAnother important aspect is water quality. This is determined by filtration and water change schedule. Filtration keeps the water clean between water changes and collects the debris for the fishkeeper to remove. Goldfish are not necessarily dirtier than other fish for their size. They are about equal to cichlids weight for weight. But lots of filtration is needed for goldfish. The best form of mechanical filtration is canister filters because they force the water through the media. In Hang-on-back (HOB) and other types of filtration only gravity forces the water through the media. So when the media is clogged the water goes under, over, or around the media rather than through it. In a canister, clogged media will reduce the flow rate, rather than simply letting water that has not been cleaned back into the tank. It is important to clean any filter at least monthly. Many people wait until the flow is reduced, and some filters claim they can go months without cleaning, but the debris in the filter will breakdown into ammonia and eventually nitrate, reducing water quality and greatly increasing nitrate concentration. In general, whatever a filter claims it can handle should be cut in half. This should be considered the absolute minimum for goldfish. The more filtration there is on the aquarium, the better. There is no such thing as too much filtration. There can be too much flow. Even in heavily filtered aquariums the aquascaping usually reduces flow, creating areas of higher and lower flow. Most goldfish can deal with moderate flow rates, especially when offered lower flow resting areas. There are some breeds and individuals less tolerant of higher flow, so when there is evidence of stress due to too much water flow, the appropriate changes to the aquarium’s setup and filtration should be made.\nWater changes are the most important aspect of water quality. Weekly water changes are the best way to keep water quality up. The minimum water change schedule is determined by the nitrate concentration, which should be maintained at no more than 40ppm with a maximum of 20ppm being a much better standard. This usually ends up being somewhere in the range of 25-50% per water change. Nitrate can reduce growth and stress the fish. There are other chemicals in the water that can have the same affect. In general if nitrate concentration is within a safe range, the other possibly problematic chemicals will be too.\nGoldfish are very hardy and can tolerate a wide temperature range. In general room temperature is ideal. The most common exception is when the room’s temperature varies so much that it can be stressful to the fish. In this case it is best to get a heater and set it at the higher end of the room’s range. The higher the temperature is, the higher their rate of metabolism. This means more waste and a higher need for oxygen. Also, the warmer the water the lower the amount of oxygen it can carry. When temperatures do get high watch for the fish gasping at the surface, this would show that they are not getting enough oxygen.\nIn general every tank should have an air pump and air stone. If there is enough surface agitation an air pump and air stone may not truly be NEEDED, but in general fish seem to do better with an air pump. They seem to be more active and have fewer health problems when they have an air pump. Some goldfish even enjoy playing in the bubbles.\nThere are many options for substrates in the aquarium, but not all are suitable for goldfish. It may seem as little more than a decoration to make the tank look better to us, but the substrate can have a huge impact on water quality, fish health, and their well being.\nThe most common substrate in freshwater aquariums is pea-sized gravel. This is not a good option for goldfish. For one, as in any tank, any sized gravel can trap a lot of debris which can cause water quality and health problems. As debris breaks down it becomes ammonia and eventually nitrate. It may even serve as a breeding ground for parasites, harmful bacteria, and other harmful organisms. Lots of debris in the substrate can lead to infestations of Planaria worms, a type of flatworm. One of the biggest threats of pea-sized gravel is that once the goldfish are big enough, they can actually swallow the gravel. The gravel can get caught in the mouth, throat, or digestive system. There is little a fishkeeper can do in this situation unless the piece of gravel is in the mouth, but even then there is little that can be done and removing the piece of gravel can cause damage to the mouth and possibly lead to infection or permanent injury.\nAquarist since 1995\nBiologist and Published Author in Multiple Aquarium Magazines\nOwner: Aquarium Maintenance Company\nAdvanced Aquarium Concepts:\nArticles about many aspects of aquarium care.', 'Goldfish Pond Water Quality\nThe Nitrogen Cycle of a Pond\nOf all ingredients in Earth’s atmosphere, nitrogen makes up about 79 percent of it. You will also find nitrogen in the DNA, RNA and proteins, the building blocks of life, in all living organisms; which makes the nitrogen cycle a requirement for sustaining any life on Earth.\nIn layman terms: your goldfish eats an aquatic plant and breaks down the plant’s proteins; the goldfish’s waste contains ammonia (NH3) gets absorbed into the soil, where aerobic bacteria convert it into nitrite (NO2) and then into nitrate (NO3); the aquatic plants in your goldfish pond absorb the nitrates as food and help the aquatic plant grow; your goldfish again eats the plant and the nitrogen cycle continues.\nIt’s these beneficial bacteria that act as a filter and happen naturally that you want to have in your goldfish pond. Without them, ammonia levels in the water will build and if they reach .025mg/liter it will potentially kill your goldfish. This is more common In a new goldfish pond that doesn’t have establish beneficial bacteria yet so it’s important test the levels of ammonia, nitrites and nitrates.\nThe number one cause for high levels of ammonia in your pond is overstocking. The more goldfish you put in your pond, the more ammonia that will build up. A goldfish excretes ammonia in two ways: 25% of it is through waste vented and the other 75% is through osmosis through the gills. If the water contains higher levels of ammonia than the goldfish, the goldfish will not excrete it and will eventually die from ammonia poisoning.\nRemember that one goldfish needs approximately 10-20 gallons. Don’t buy all your goldfish at once; buy them slowly over time so you can more easily adjust your goldfish pond’s nitrogen cycle.\nRelated Content: Stocking a Pond\nAdding Aquatic Plants\nAquatic plants are a vital component of the nitrogen cycle These live aquatic plants help control the levels of nitrates by using them up as plant food. If the ammonia levels in your goldfish pond are constantly too high try adding a few more plants.\nRotting plant material is also a source of your goldfish pond’s bioload, the biological material that adds to the water pollution of a pond. One of those pollutants is ammonia. If your ammonia test kit shows elevated levels of ammonia, try removing any rotting aquatic plant debris from your pond.\nRelated Content: Aquatic Plants\nPerform a Water Change\nRegular water changes of your pond water will help reduce ammonia levels. Fresh clean water is one of the best things you can give your goldfish. It is recommend to do a 20% water change every one to two weeks for an established tank. For your goldfish pond, do a 10% to 20% when your test kit shows elevated ammonia levels. Sometimes your goldfish pond will require a full water change in order to do seasonal maintenance when your aquatic plants out grow the size of your pond.\nRelated Content: Pond Maintenance\nAdd Pond Filtration\nIf you can, set up a mechanical filtration system in your goldfish pond. A mechanical filter can contribute to the health of your pond in many ways. The most noticeable is that a filter sucks up goldfish waste and rotting plant material; both of which contribute to the bioload of a pond and the increasing levels of ammonia.\nWith a mechanical filter, you can also benefit from having less frequent water changes. Less frequent being the keyword, since nothing can beat a water change, that doesn’t mean that you can simply add a filter and your maintenance requirements are over. You will need to perform regular cleanings of the goldfish pond’s filter; which should be easier than a water change. It’s easy to believe your pond is clean if you can’t visibly see any waste or decomposing plants in your pond, but that just means two things: One, your filter is working and two, all that bioload is in the filter which until removed will continue to add to your goldfish pond’s ammonia levels.\nLow Oxygen Levels in a Goldfish Pond\nDuring the summer months or in periods of hot weather are when most goldfish pond keepers struggle with low oxygen levels in their pond. The combination of high temperatures and low water circulation are the main causes of lower than normal oxygen levels in your goldfish pond. This in turn can lead to very low levels of gas exchange (oxygen and carbon dioxide) and if measures are not taken, can lead to the death of your goldfish.\nLow oxygen levels in your goldfish pond can be caused by the aquatic plants you have living in it. Aquatic plants produce oxygen during the day but will then compete with your goldfish at night for the available oxygen in the pond’s water. This also goes for algae blooms, blanketweed, lilly pads and even green water. If the surface of your goldfish pond become over run with these floating plants like duck weed, frogbit or lilly pads, the surface area at which gasses can be exchanged is reduced, also contributing to lower oxygen levels in the water. These additional living inhabitants that compete for oxygen and reduce the surface area of your pond is most likely the cause for any goldfish loss overnight.\nAlong with goldfish loss, your goldfish will become less active, listless and you might even see them near the surface the surface gasping for air. You might even smell a foul odor coming from your goldfish pond.\nRaise oxygen levels\nTo keep your goldfish happy and oxygenated you should remove unwanted aquatic plants or algae blooms, creating more surface area and maximizing the exchange of gasses. You will also want to remove any decaying organic material from the bottom or floating free in the pond. If your goldfish pond has a waterfall or fountain you should run them over night during hot weather. These water features will help maintain oxygen levels at night when your aquatic plants using them up. Finally, if you don’t have one already, add a pond air pump that uses air stones to release small air bubbles into your goldfish pond and run it 24/7.\nMaintain the pH Balance in Your Goldfish Pond\nWhat is pH?\nH2O splits into two parts: a positively charged hydrogen, H+ and the negatively charged hydroxyl, OH-; pH is the measurement of hydrogen ions available in the water. The term ph literally means “power of hydrogen”.\npH is based on a scale from 1-14; one being the most acidic and 14 being the most alkaline. The pH scale is logarithmic which means that for example, a pH of 8 is ten time more alkaline than a pH of seven. A pH level of 7 is neutral and in most cases, most tap water is close to that range, plus or minus .5 pH. Rain water in your tap water system can be the cause of a lower than 7 pH reading and an elevated reading can be the cause of chemically altered water by municipalities in hard water zones.\nYour goldfish will thrive in waters with a pH of 7-8.5, neutral to slightly alkaline.\nYou can buy an inexpensive pH test kit at your local pet store. There are a few options when selecting pH test kits: strips, drops or tablets. All of them will give you close to the same readings; the tablets and drops being the more accurate methods but taking a few more minutes to get a reading. There are no real tricks or difficulties in testing your goldfish aquarium’s pH, just read the easy to follow direction on the box of your pH testing kit.\nLow pH: Acidic\nLow pH levels are caused by\n- Rain water that can contain natural acids.\n- Wind blown leaves and other organic material.\n- Decaying and dying back aquatic plants.\nSymptoms of low pH levels\n- Goldfish are listless or slow moving\n- Pond snails begin to die off\n- Slow growth of aquatic plants\nAdvanced Symptoms of pH Derangement\n- Excess mucus production of goldfish\n- Milky skin of goldfish\n- Slime coat peals off\n- burning of goldfish skin\nHigh pH: Alkaline\nHigh pH levels are caused by\n- New goldfish ponds can leach lime out of concrete.\n- Concrete dust or particles left in new goldfish pond.\n- Excessive algae growth that will consume CO2.\nSymptoms of high pH levels\n- Slow growth of aquatic plants\n- White powdery coating on aquatic plants*\n*calcium precipitating found on aquatic plants like Elodea Crispa.\nGoldfish are sensitive to pH level changes. A fast decrease in pH can kill your goldfish. A fast increase is less harmful but in general, don’t change your goldfish tank’s water more than .5 pH at a time.']	['<urn:uuid:1f58c459-1018-4926-9d52-759ef0b041dd>', '<urn:uuid:84c6cc78-8d4e-495d-a4ef-fd10fde100b8>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	8	72	2511
35	I'm curious about job opportunities - how will innovation help create jobs in Europe?	Innovation in raw materials sectors will create jobs by helping the best ideas reach the market. The development of new processing techniques will generate new intellectual property in Europe and allow new types of natural deposits and industrial residues to be mined. Additionally, training a new generation of skilled engineers and metallurgists will expand Europe's innovation potential and create more employment opportunities in these fields.	['1. Develop innovative technological solutions to optimize raw materials & waste treatment: Accessing strategic materials is critical. So it is of paramount importance to extend the knowledge base in processing and extractive metallurgy to optimize the transformation of ore or waste stream into valuable materials\n2. Enhance EU skills in mineral processing and extractive metallurgy of ores and industrial residues: Industrial companies cannot afford employing all the specialists required to support their activities. But they need these specialists to exist in Europe and they need to know where to find them. EuROPEM will provide access to these specialists.\n3. In the longer term, boost the innovation capacity of the EU raw materials related sectors.\nBy training a new generation of skilled engineers and metallurgists, the network will contribute to expand the future European innovation potential.\nSince the mid-2000s, numerous European Countries, and the European Union itself, have realized how dependent they have been on foreign imports to access non energetic raw materials. This dependence has been interpreted as a threat to Europe’s industrial network and global competitiveness. In parallel, it has also been recognized that Europe holds valuable mineral resources in both primary and secondary markets. Sources of such minerals being either underground or in our trash boxes create new market opportunities that will support much needed economic growth in Europe.\nHowever, to size this opportunity, the development of new extractive, mineral processing and metallurgical techniques are required. Before being industrially developed, these techniques need not only to be efficient but also to take into account the economics and the environmental and societal aspects in Europe and abroad. Techniques fulfilling these requirements will first generate new IP in Europe and also allow new types of natural deposits and industrial residues to be mined, creating subsequently more wealth in Europe.\nInnovation bases on strong R&D knowledge and capabilities. It is essential to enable Europe to regain its former leading position in these domains by mobilizing and networking substantial part of the European raw materials community. In addition, having good ideas is not enough to generate innovation. Helping the best ideas to reach the market by enabling them to progress on the TRL scale is critical to leverage the effect of public support in R&D and create more jobs.\nIn this context, numerous networks have emerged in Europe, dealing, at least partly, with the issue of mineralurgy and extractive metallurgy (e.g. the Era-net on non-energetic raw materials ERAMIN or the REE focused network ERECON). Nevertheless, there is still a lack in Europe of a structure bridging closely research and innovation of the primary and secondary raw materials value chain and business models that allow cross fertilization of ideas and successful demonstration up to the pilot scale.\nThe EuROPEM Network fills this gap by gathering academic and industrial partners. It aims at coordinating and financially supporting R&D works on transversal issues in the fields of mineralurgy and extractive metallurgy. The annual funding of the network will originate from fees of the members and EU as well as national support (depending on the opportunities).\n- Supporting pre-competitive R&D works\nPre-competitive R&D works on issues of interest for the industrial partners gathered in the End-Users Group will be financially supported by the Network through grants to buy small equipement or finance non-permanent co-workers together with associated expenditures, within academic institutions. When promising, scale-up will be possible with industrial funding.\n- Facilitating the emergence of promising collaborative projects\nBy providing a broad forum for academic and industrial partners to exchange on mineralurgy and extractive metallurgy, this network will be a place to find the right partners to build consortia able to provide a holistic approach to raw material questions.\n- Enabling innovation\nOne trump card of this network is its capacity to support the further development of promising processes up to the pilot scale through facilitated access to the existing piloting platforms, which will be gathered into a platform network (see the MetNet RM-Commitment. EuROPEM will be closely linked to the European Institute of Hydrometallurgy (to be built from 2014 to 2017, see the EIH RM-Commitment).\nThe successful creation of this mineralurgical and metallurgical research network would result in:\n- Reinforcing the position of European industries on their traditional markets because even raw material production has turned from labour-intensive to knowledge intensive. But also allowing them to access new markets (like the recycling of high tech-products)\n- Facilitate technology transfer from academia to industry by reinforcing synergism between these major stakeholders of innovation\n- Cross fertilisation between extractive metallurgy and other important fields of activity in Europe. For exemple metallurgy may befenit to chemistry (for example for natural substances extraction) or medicine (e.g. fast diagnostics). But cross fertilisation also works the other way round, for example new modelling tool facilitating operation in metallurgical plants and new business models issuing from other sectors may be implemented in processing plants.\n- More young people coming back to science and technology to support the position of Europe as the world leading region in knowledge economy\n- Better exchange of knowledge and good practices via bridges being built with scientific communities in Northern and Southern America, Australia, but also developing countries\nInnovation is not only enabling new ideas to blossom in academic laboratories. Innovation is also helping these ideas to reach the market. By combining industrial interests and academic creativity this proposed network will boost Europe’s innovation potential. The Network will provide industry with a single access point to the European research potential in RM sciences and will provide academics with a facilitated access to the end-users able to boost their innovation potential.\nCEA will coordinate the network and act as the secretariat of the network.\nIt includes among others the creation of the different bodies, the coordination of the actions of the network, the identification of financing opportunity, the dissemination, the communication and the education & training actions.\nCEA will also be involved in the R&D projects issuing from the network']	['<urn:uuid:aab4833a-80e9-4f28-8b96-64c7e9226de2>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	14	65	992
36	who regulates organic dog food standards	The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) regulates organic dog food standards. However, organic regulations specific for pet foods are still being developed, and currently pet foods claiming to be organic must meet USDA's National Organic Program human food regulations.	"[""DOG / nutrition\nWhat is the Difference Between Natural and Organic Dog Food\nFiguring out the best diet for your pup can be a difficult decision, especially because there are so many options and varieties of dog food out there. There is also a wealth of information on the internet about what is best or most healthy for your dog and not all of it might match up. It’s important that pet parents always talk to their vet when it comes to decisions like what food to feed your dog. Your vet is the most trusted source of information about what food will be best for your pup and will help them live their best life.\nWhen researching dog food, you have probably come across diets such as organic dog food, natural dog food, and grain-free dog food. These foods all have different ingredients and important distinctions that put them into these categories. So what is the difference between these diets and how can you choose the best food for your pup? Keep reading to learn more.\nWhat is Organic Dog Food?\n“Organic” is an extremely common term that most pet parents have probably heard at one point or another. This term commonly describes foods you’ve seen in the vegetable, fruit, or meat aisle. The standards for organic human food are different from that of dog food. In order for human food to be considered organic, it has to meet a huge list of meticulous regulations. Dog food, on the other hand, is regulated by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO).\nAccording to AAFCO, the term organic is defined as “organic animal feed [that] meets production and handling requirements of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Organic Program (NOP).”\nThey then go on to say “organic regulations specific for pet foods are currently being developed. In the interim, the NOP has said that pet foods claiming to be organic must meet its human food regulations.”\nWhat is Natural Dog Food?\nIt’s more about what isn’t in the food than what is. In order to be labeled “natural,” pet food must be made without added artificial colors, flavors or preservatives. With the exception of certain vitamins, mineral, and trace nutrients, the ingredients in natural food can come only from plants, animals, or naturally occurring minerals. Many natural dog food brands are also free of byproducts.\nWhat is Grain-Free Dog Food?\nGrain-free dog food is just what it sounds like -- free from grains. Some of the most common grains include\n- And More\nThese ingredients can be tied to some of the most common food allergies and sensitivities in dogs.\nQuestions to Ask When Choosing a Dog Food:\nSo which diet is right for your pet and how do you choose? First things first, schedule an appointment with your vet. They will be able to evaluate your pup and help you pair them with an optimal diet. Not every dog benefits from grain-free dog food, organic dog food, or natural dog food and it is important to consult with your vet to figure out what the right fit is for them.\nSome questions you can ask yourself and discuss with your veterinarian about how to choose the right dog food include:\n1. Does Your Dog Have Food Sensitivities or Allergies?\nFood sensitivities and allergies are more common than you think and if your dog has one, then they might benefit from a limited-ingredient or grain-free dog food. Signs of food sensitivities and allergies include itchy/dry skin, frequent diarrhea, vomiting, patchy fur, and more. Your vet can help identify signs of allergies/sensitivities and help you determine the diet that will help your dog start to feel better.\n2. Does Your Pup Have Preferences?\nSome dogs have preferences for what food tastes good to them and keeps them looking forward to their meals. While most dogs aren't picky, some preferences could include liking wet food more than dry food or chicken more than beef. These are things to consider when deciding what to feed your dog.\n3. What Size is Your Dog?\nBigger dogs need more food and smaller dogs need less. The size of your dog is an important factor in choosing your food. If they burn more energy, then they need more calories in their diet.\n4. Do They Have Health Considerations?\nThere are dog diets that can support a variety of health considerations. If your pup has something going on with their health, then their vet can help figure out what diet might support them in their efforts to feel their very best.\nWith so many different types of dog food on the market, it can be difficult to know the difference between them and where to start. Remember to always talk to your veterinarian about what will benefit your pup the most.\nInformation in this article is not intended to diagnose, treat or cure your pet and is not a substitute for veterinary care provided by a licensed veterinarian.

37	When did the concept of quantum computing first appear and who introduced it for the first time?	The idea of quantum computing first appeared in 1980, when Russian-born mathematician Yuri Manin, who worked at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, first proposed the notion, although in a rather vague form.	['Quantum computing is all the rage. It seems like hardly a day goes by without some news outlet describing the extraordinary things this technology promises. Most commentators forget, or just gloss over, the fact that people have been working on quantum computing for decades—and without any practical results to show for it.\nWe’ve been told that quantum computers could “provide breakthroughs in many disciplines, including materials and drug discovery, the optimization of complex manmade systems, and artificial intelligence.” We’ve been assured that quantum computers will “forever alter our economic, industrial, academic, and societal landscape.” We’ve even been told that “the encryption that protects the world’s most sensitive data may soon be broken” by quantum computers. It has gotten to the point where many researchers in various fields of physics feel obliged to justify whatever work they are doing by claiming that it has some relevance to quantum computing.\nMeanwhile, government research agencies, academic departments (many of them funded by government agencies), and corporate laboratories are spending billions of dollars a year developing quantum computers. On Wall Street, Morgan Stanley and other financial giants expect quantum computing to mature soon and are keen to figure out how this technology can help them.\nIt’s become something of a self-perpetuating arms race, with many organizations seemingly staying in the race if only to avoid being left behind. Some of the world’s top technical talent, at places like Google, IBM, and Microsoft, are working hard, and with lavish resources in state-of-the-art laboratories, to realize their vision of a quantum-computing future.\nIn light of all this, it’s natural to wonder: When will useful quantum computers be constructed? The most optimistic experts estimate it will take 5 to 10 years. More cautious ones predict 20 to 30 years. (Similar predictions have been voiced, by the way, for the last 20 years.) I belong to a tiny minority that answers, “Not in the foreseeable future.” Having spent decades conducting research in quantum and condensed-matter physics, I’ve developed my very pessimistic view. It’s based on an understanding of the gargantuan technical challenges that would have to be overcome to ever make quantum computing work.\nThe idea of quantum computing first appeared nearly 40 years ago, in 1980, when the Russian-born mathematician Yuri Manin, who now works at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, in Bonn, first put forward the notion, albeit in a rather vague form. The concept really got on the map, though, the following year, when physicist Richard Feynman, at the California Institute of Technology, independently proposed it.\nRealizing that computer simulations of quantum systems become impossible to carry out when the system under scrutiny gets too complicated, Feynman advanced the idea that the computer itself should operate in the quantum mode: “Nature isn’t classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you’d better make it quantum mechanical, and by golly it’s a wonderful problem, because it doesn’t look so easy,” he opined. A few years later, Oxford physicist David Deutsch formally described a general-purpose quantum computer, a quantum analog of the universal Turing machine.\nThe subject did not attract much attention, though, until 1994, when mathematician Peter Shor (then at Bell Laboratories and now at MIT) proposed an algorithm for an ideal quantum computer that would allow very large numbers to be factored much faster than could be done on a conventional computer. This outstanding theoretical result triggered an explosion of interest in quantum computing. Many thousands of research papers, mostly theoretical, have since been published on the subject, and they continue to come out at an increasing rate.\nThe basic idea of quantum computing is to store and process information in a way that is very different from what is done in conventional computers, which are based on classical physics. Boiling down the many details, it’s fair to say that conventional computers operate by manipulating a large number of tiny transistors working essentially as on-off switches, which change state between cycles of the computer’s clock.\nThe state of the classical computer at the start of any given clock cycle can therefore be described by a long sequence of bits corresponding physically to the states of individual transistors. With N transistors, there are 2N possible states for the computer to be in. Computation on such a machine fundamentally consists of switching some of its transistors between their “on” and “off” states, according to a prescribed program.\nIn quantum computing, the classical two-state circuit element (the transistor) is replaced by a quantum element called a quantum bit, or qubit. Like the conventional bit, it also has two basic states. Although a variety of physical objects could reasonably serve as quantum bits, the simplest thing to use is the electron’s internal angular momentum, or spin, which has the peculiar quantum property of having only two possible projections on any coordinate axis: +1/2 or –1/2 (in units of the Planck constant). For whatever the chosen axis, you can denote the two basic quantum states of the electron’s spin as ↑ and ↓.\nHere’s where things get weird. With the quantum bit, those two states aren’t the only ones possible. That’s because the spin state of an electron is described by a quantum-mechanical wave function. And that function involves two complex numbers, α and β (called quantum amplitudes), which, being complex numbers, have real parts and imaginary parts. Those complex numbers, α and β, each have a certain magnitude, and according to the rules of quantum mechanics, their squared magnitudes must add up to 1.\nThat’s because those two squared magnitudes correspond to the probabilities for the spin of the electron to be in the basic states ↑ and ↓ when you measure it. And because those are the only outcomes possible, the two associated probabilities must add up to 1. For example, if the probability of finding the electron in the ↑ state is 0.6 (60 percent), then the probability of finding it in the ↓ state must be 0.4 (40 percent)—nothing else would make sense.\nIn contrast to a classical bit, which can only be in one of its two basic states, a qubit can be in any of a continuum of possible states, as defined by the values of the quantum amplitudes α and β. This property is often described by the rather mystical and intimidating statement that a qubit can exist simultaneously in both of its ↑ and ↓ states.\nYes, quantum mechanics often defies intuition. But this concept shouldn’t be couched in such perplexing language. Instead, think of a vector positioned in the x-y plane and canted at 45 degrees to the x-axis. Somebody might say that this vector simultaneously points in both the x- and y-directions. That statement is true in some sense, but it’s not really a useful description. Describing a qubit as being simultaneously in both ↑ and ↓ states is, in my view, similarly unhelpful. And yet, it’s become almost de rigueur for journalists to describe it as such.\nIn a system with two qubits, there are 22 or 4 basic states, which can be written (↑↑), (↑↓), (↓↑), and (↓↓). Naturally enough, the two qubits can be described by a quantum-mechanical wave function that involves four complex numbers. In the general case of N qubits, the state of the system is described by 2N complex numbers, which are restricted by the condition that their squared magnitudes must all add up to 1.\nWhile a conventional computer with N bits at any given moment must be in one of its 2N possible states, the state of a quantum computer with N qubits is described by the values of the 2N quantum amplitudes, which are continuous parameters (ones that can take on any value, not just a 0 or a 1). This is the origin of the supposed power of the quantum computer, but it is also the reason for its great fragility and vulnerability.\nHow is information processed in such a machine? That’s done by applying certain kinds of transformations—dubbed “quantum gates”—that change these parameters in a precise and controlled manner.\nExperts estimate that the number of qubits needed for a useful quantum computer, one that could compete with your laptop in solving certain kinds of interesting problems, is between 1,000 and 100,000. So the number of continuous parameters describing the state of such a useful quantum computer at any given moment must be at least 21,000, which is to say about 10300. That’s a very big number indeed. How big? It is much, much greater than the number of subatomic particles in the observable universe.\nTo repeat: A useful quantum computer needs to process a set of continuous parameters that is larger than the number of subatomic particles in the observable universe.\nAt this point in a description of a possible future technology, a hardheaded engineer loses interest. But let’s continue. In any real-world computer, you have to consider the effects of errors. In a conventional computer, those arise when one or more transistors are switched off when they are supposed to be switched on, or vice versa. This unwanted occurrence can be dealt with using relatively simple error-correction methods, which make use of some level of redundancy built into the hardware.\nIn contrast, it’s absolutely unimaginable how to keep errors under control for the 10300 continuous parameters that must be processed by a useful quantum computer. Yet quantum-computing theorists have succeeded in convincing the general public that this is feasible. Indeed, they claim that something called the threshold theorem proves it can be done. They point out that once the error per qubit per quantum gate is below a certain value, indefinitely long quantum computation becomes possible, at a cost of substantially increasing the number of qubits needed. With those extra qubits, they argue, you can handle errors by forming logical qubits using multiple physical qubits.\nHow many physical qubits would be required for each logical qubit? No one really knows, but estimates typically range from about 1,000 to 100,000. So the upshot is that a useful quantum computer now needs a million or more qubits. And the number of continuous parameters defining the state of this hypothetical quantum-computing machine—which was already more than astronomical with 1,000 qubits—now becomes even more ludicrous.\nEven without considering these impossibly large numbers, it’s sobering that no one has yet figured out how to combine many physical qubits into a smaller number of logical qubits that can compute something useful. And it’s not like this hasn’t long been a key goal.\nIn the early 2000s, at the request of the Advanced Research and Development Activity (a funding agency of the U.S. intelligence community that is now part of Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity), a team of distinguished experts in quantum information established a road map for quantum computing. It had a goal for 2012 that “requires on the order of 50 physical qubits” and “exercises multiple logical qubits through the full range of operations required for fault-tolerant [quantum computation] in order to perform a simple instance of a relevant quantum algorithm….” It’s now the end of 2018, and that ability has still not been demonstrated.\nThe huge amount of scholarly literature that’s been generated about quantum-computing is notably light on experimental studies describing actual hardware. The relatively few experiments that have been reported were extremely difficult to conduct, though, and must command respect and admiration.\nThe goal of such proof-of-principle experiments is to show the possibility of carrying out basic quantum operations and to demonstrate some elements of the quantum algorithms that have been devised. The number of qubits used for them is below 10, usually from 3 to 5. Apparently, going from 5 qubits to 50 (the goal set by the ARDA Experts Panel for the year 2012) presents experimental difficulties that are hard to overcome. Most probably they are related to the simple fact that 25 = 32, while 250 = 1,125,899,906,842,624.\nBy contrast, the theory of quantum computing does not appear to meet any substantial difficulties in dealing with millions of qubits. In studies of error rates, for example, various noise models are being considered. It has been proved (under certain assumptions) that errors generated by “local” noise can be corrected by carefully designed and very ingenious methods, involving, among other tricks, massive parallelism, with many thousands of gates applied simultaneously to different pairs of qubits and many thousands of measurements done simultaneously, too.\nA decade and a half ago, ARDA’s Experts Panel noted that “it has been established, under certain assumptions, that if a threshold precision per gate operation could be achieved, quantum error correction would allow a quantum computer to compute indefinitely.” Here, the key words are “under certain assumptions.” That panel of distinguished experts did not, however, address the question of whether these assumptions could ever be satisfied.\nI argue that they can’t. In the physical world, continuous quantities (be they voltages or the parameters defining quantum-mechanical wave functions) can be neither measured nor manipulated exactly. That is, no continuously variable quantity can be made to have an exact value, including zero. To a mathematician, this might sound absurd, but this is the unquestionable reality of the world we live in, as any engineer knows.\nSure, discrete quantities, like the number of students in a classroom or the number of transistors in the “on” state, can be known exactly. Not so for quantities that vary continuously. And this fact accounts for the great difference between a conventional digital computer and the hypothetical quantum computer.\nIndeed, all of the assumptions that theorists make about the preparation of qubits into a given state, the operation of the quantum gates, the reliability of the measurements, and so forth, cannot be fulfilled exactly. They can only be approached with some limited precision. So, the real question is: What precision is required? With what exactitude must, say, the square root of 2 (an irrational number that enters into many of the relevant quantum operations) be experimentally realized? Should it be approximated as 1.41 or as 1.41421356237? Or is even more precision needed? There are no clear answers to these crucial questions.\nWhile various strategies for building quantum computers are now being explored, an approach that many people consider the most promising, initially undertaken by the Canadian company D-Wave Systems and now being pursued by IBM, Google, Microsoft, and others, is based on using quantum systems of interconnected Josephson junctions cooled to very low temperatures (down to about 10 millikelvins).\nThe ultimate goal is to create a universal quantum computer, one that can beat conventional computers in factoring large numbers using Shor’s algorithm, performing database searches by a similarly famous quantum-computing algorithm that Lov Grover developed at Bell Laboratories in 1996, and other specialized applications that are suitable for quantum computers.\nOn the hardware front, advanced research is under way, with a 49-qubit chip (Intel), a 50-qubit chip (IBM), and a 72-qubit chip (Google) having recently been fabricated and studied. The eventual outcome of this activity is not entirely clear, especially because these companies have not revealed the details of their work.\nWhile I believe that such experimental research is beneficial and may lead to a better understanding of complicated quantum systems, I’m skeptical that these efforts will ever result in a practical quantum computer. Such a computer would have to be able to manipulate—on a microscopic level and with enormous precision—a physical system characterized by an unimaginably huge set of parameters, each of which can take on a continuous range of values. Could we ever learn to control the more than 10300 continuously variable parameters defining the quantum state of such a system?\nMy answer is simple. No, never.\nI believe that, appearances to the contrary, the quantum computing fervor is nearing its end. That’s because a few decades is the maximum lifetime of any big bubble in technology or science. After a certain period, too many unfulfilled promises have been made, and anyone who has been following the topic starts to get annoyed by further announcements of impending breakthroughs. What’s more, by that time all the tenured faculty positions in the field are already occupied. The proponents have grown older and less zealous, while the younger generation seeks something completely new and more likely to succeed.\nAll these problems, as well as a few others I’ve not mentioned here, raise serious doubts about the future of quantum computing. There is a tremendous gap between the rudimentary but very hard experiments that have been carried out with a few qubits and the extremely developed quantum-computing theory, which relies on manipulating thousands to millions of qubits to calculate anything useful. That gap is not likely to be closed anytime soon.\nTo my mind, quantum computing researchers should still heed an admonition that IBM physicist Rolf Landauer made decades ago when the field heated up for the first time. He urged proponents of quantum computing to include in their publications a disclaimer along these lines: “This scheme, like all other schemes for quantum computation, relies on speculative technology, does not in its current form take into account all possible sources of noise, unreliability and manufacturing error, and probably will not work.”\nEditor’s note: A sentence in this article originally stated that concerns over required precision “were never even discussed.” This sentence was changed on 30 November 2018 after some readers pointed out to the author instances in the literature that had considered these issues. The amended sentence now reads: “There are no clear answers to these crucial questions.”\nAbout the Author\nMikhail Dyakonov does research in theoretical physics at Charles Coulomb Laboratory at the University of Montpellier, in France.

38	What causes extreme height in skyscrapers according to Clark and Kingston?	According to Clark and Kingston (1930), extreme height in skyscrapers is a result of profit maximization.	"['Skyscrapers and the Skyline: Manhattan, 1895-2004\nAbstractThis article investigates the market for skyscrapers in Manhattan from 1895 to 2004. Clark and Kingston (1930) have argued that extreme height is a result of profit maximization, while Helsley and Strange (2008) posit that skyscraper height can be caused, in part, by strategic interaction among builders. I provide a model for the market for building height and the number of completions, which are functions of the market fundamentals and the desire of builders to stand out in the skyline. I test this model using time series data. I find that skyscraper completions and average heights over the 20th century are consistent with profit maximization; the desire to add extra height to stand out does not appear to be a systematic determinant of building height.

39	dopamine addiction effects emdr therapy	Drug use produces large dopamine surges that reinforce substance use and pleasure connections, leading to addiction. EMDR therapy can help by reducing emotional distress from traumatic memories through eye movement exercises, helping replace negative emotional reactions with less-charged or positive ones.	['- Aug 17\n- AddictionTeen Drug Alcohol AbuseTeen Substance Abuse\nThe human brain is an incredible and complex organ. Each of its many parts is interconnected to regulate everything you do. From breathing to eating to creating beautiful works of art, it coordinates every human activity. It also enables you to interpret, respond and feel. Basically, your brain makes you, you.\nMuch like introducing a virus to an incredibly intricate computer, changes to your brain can have huge and devastating consequences. If you ingest drugs, those changes tamper with your brain’s chemistry. Chronic substance use doesn’t just lead to addiction — it wreaks havoc on your brain’s ability to perform its many functions properly.\nHow Drugs Affect the Brain\nNearly all drugs alter a person’s state of mind by tampering with the brain’s communication system. Brain cells or neurons send messages by releasing chemicals called neurotransmitters into the gap between them and the next neuron. Once the neurotransmitter crosses the gap, called the synapse, it attaches perfectly to receptors on the receiving cell. This causes the next neuron to become stimulated and continues the communication chain.\nDrugs interfere with the way your neurons send and receive signals by affecting the chemical neurotransmitters. Here’s how the most common drugs negatively impact your brain:\n- Drugs like heroin or marijuana mimic natural neurotransmitters by attaching onto and activating neurons, causing abnormal messages to be sent throughout the network.\n- Drugs like cocaine or amphetamines cause neurons to release large amounts of the brain’s natural chemicals, which can amplify or distort normal communication between neurons.\nWhat Happens to Your Brain if You Keep Taking Drugs?\nDrugs alter incredibly important parts of the brain, each one essential for life-sustaining functions. If you keep taking them, drugs affect your brain in tangible ways, including:\n- The part of the brain that plays a role in the pleasurable sensations you get from certain activities becomes less sensitive, making it difficult to feel pleasure from anything but the drug.\n- In contrast, the part of the brain that impacts stressful feelings, irritability and unease becomes more sensitive. Thus, when you attempt to stop using, you experience severe withdrawal symptoms.\n- Drugs impact the part of the brain associated with decision-making and impulse control, causing those with a substance use disorder to seek out drugs compulsively.\nWhat Happens to Your Brain When You Become Addicted?\nWhen you use drugs, your brain produces large surges of dopamine. This powerful neurotransmitter signals that something is pleasurable and needs to be remembered. It also leads to the formation of habits, as you feel the urge to repeat these activities over and over again.\nThe production of dopamine due to drug use reinforces the connection between substance use and pleasure, teaching the brain to seek drugs at the expense of healthier activities. This change in your brain chemistry, along with an increased tolerance the longer you use a drug, can ultimately lead to addiction.\nWhat Is Wet Brain Syndrome?\nUntreated alcohol use disorder can put you at risk of a condition known as wet brain, or Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. This disorder is actually two different conditions:\n- Wernicke’s disease: A neurological disease that affects voluntary movement and causes eye abnormalities.\n- Korsakoff syndrome: A mental disorder that results in disproportionate memory loss.\nWernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is characterized by an almost nonexistent ability to form new memories. Signs that someone struggling with alcoholism may also have wet brain are symptoms like those associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Wet brain syndrome is treatable as long as you stop drinking and seek help immediately.\nWarning Signs Your Substance Use Is Altering Your Brain\nDrug use may eventually cause dramatic changes to your brain’s neurons and circuits. These changes can linger even after you’ve stopped drinking or taking drugs, especially when a substance is used over and over again.\nSome of the warning signs that drugs or alcohol are having long-term effects on your brain include:\n- Memory problems\n- Negative thoughts\n- Behavioral changes\n- Mental illness\nDon’t Let Substance Use Impact Your Health for One More Day\nWhether you’re struggling with troubling symptoms related to substance use or you’re just ready to break free from the chains of drugs or alcohol, let Gateway help. We offer personalized, evidence-based treatments for drug and alcohol addiction in a compassionate environment of care in Chicago, Illinois.\nDon’t let substance use rob you of healthy brain function and a fuller life. Contact us online or call 877.379.9078 to speak with a member of our compassionate team.', 'Addiction Treatment Therapies\nThose who need treatment for substance use disorders may be unaware of what the whole rehabilitation process entails—including the full range of potential therapeutic offerings.\nSome people may equate rehab with some form of medical detox, but detox alone is not a substitute for more comprehensive, longer-term addiction treatment.1 Continued treatment can help prevent relapse and lower relapse-related risks, such as overdose.1,2 Ongoing addiction treatment is likely to consist of several therapeutic approaches combined with the intention of increasing treatment engagement, changing maladaptive behaviors, and ultimately helping people achieve long-term abstinence.1\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy\nWhile originally utilized to treat depression, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was later adapted to help prevent relapse in people with substance use disorders such as alcoholism and cocaine addiction.3,4 The treatment method, and its application in addiction medicine, is based on the theory that individuals can best modify their substance use behavior by identifying learned patterns linking specific contexts, thoughts, and feelings as they relate to maladaptive behaviors (in this case, drug and/or alcohol use).4\nIn recognizing these patterns, people may begin to “unlearn” them. They may work toward these ends through the development of better coping skills—such as by avoiding high-risk situations, places, people, or other triggers, as well as by improving their ability to manage cravings and more-positively react to negative thoughts/moods.3,4\nRecovering from addiction isn’t just about working on the issues that brought someone to treatment, but about managing ones yet to emerge in the future. Patients need to be prepared for what awaits them post-treatment, and CBT techniques can help with that. While it would be ideal to altogether avoid triggers and other stressors, it’s not always possible. Armed with a set of improved coping skills learned through cognitive-behavioral approaches, individuals leaving treatment may be better prepared, should they encounter a new trigger, to take a step back and think about how to proceed before they act. That’s really what CBT is all about—retraining a potentially maladaptive pattern of thoughts and behaviors to a more healthy, positive one.\nMotivational Interviewing (MI) approaches clients in a manner that allows them to come to terms with the reasons they are in treatment and what they need to address on their own to make progress in recovery. This guided process uses specific methods of questioning clients so they can come to terms with what has been stopping them from moving forward with the changes they desire to make.\nIn many cases, continuing to drink or use drugs and getting help for the underlying substance use disorder(s) represent opposing desires for individuals in treatment. Using motivational interviewing techniques, therapists work with their patients to help resolve this ambivalence in favor of reinforcing the resolve and recovery efforts made to quit.3 There are four core principles of motivational interviewing. They are:5\n- Express empathy—Rapport may be better developed with the patient in recovery by demonstrating empathy. Therapists repeat patients’ statements back to them through reflective listening in order to convey that they are present and understand how they feel in terms of ambivalence to treatment.\n- Develop discrepancy—Therapists subtly point out how current patient behaviors may interfere with the positive changes they want to see happen in their lives. The perception of this discrepancy can motivate change\n- Roll with resistance—Therapists use compassion and empathy in the face of resistance, rather than confrontation or demands.\n- Support self-efficacy—Therapists can boost self-esteem and self-confidence of the individual in treatment. Believing in one’s own ability to make healthy changes helps motivate them to realize their goals.\nEye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing\nEye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is a type of psychotherapy for people with post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. Its therapeutic potential comes from its ability to reduce the emotional distress associated with certain traumatic memories.6 Such a therapeutic effect may also be helpful when applied to cases of co-occurring substance use disorder and trauma-related mental health conditions.\nThrough EMDR, patients in recovery work to replace negative emotional reactions to specific problematic memories with less-charged ones or, even, positive ones.6 The person in treatment will be asked to recall specific traumas while performing a pattern of repetitive eye movements (or, in some cases, sequences of finger tapping or musical tones), and this “dual stimulation” helps that individual to work against the negative feelings that the trauma evokes.6\nA positive, replacement thought becomes the focus while the client engages in the repeated behavior for 20-30 seconds or however long the therapist deems necessary. After this process is complete, the client discusses the experience with the therapist. The EMDR process is then repeated as long as negative feelings remain present in an effort to retrain the mind in how to respond to the initial traumatizing thoughts.\nDialectical Behavioral Therapy\nDialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) is a cognitive-behavioral treatment approach initially developed to help decrease the self-harming and self-defeating behaviors commonly encountered in individuals with borderline personality disorder. This therapeutic approach has since been adapted to treat people with various other mental health issues, including substance use disorder.3,6 DBT combines the emotional regulation of CBT with the teaching of mindfulness skills, distress tolerance, and improved interpersonal effectiveness with the goal of decreasing continued substance use.3\nExpressive, Holistic and Complementary Therapies\nArt therapy and music therapy are both forms of expressive therapy used at some treatment centers to complement some of the more standard approaches to substance abuse rehabilitation. Neither require the client to be artistically inclined. Rather, individuals learn different art techniques through classroom sessions that focus on giving participants healthy and positive ways to relieve stress while doing something they enjoy.\nThese therapies are less about the end product—the musical performance or the finished artwork—and more about the creation process. Oftentimes, various feelings and issues may come up in the creation process that may be further explored in individual therapy.\nOther complementary approaches that may be encountered at certain treatment centers:\n12-Step Facilitation / Recovery Groups\nActive participation in peer support or self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, or other 12-Step program varieties is an important element of many long-term treatment strategies. 12-Step facilitation, as a therapeutic intervention, strives to motivate acceptance of the need for abstinence and foster a willingness to actively engage with 12-Step fellowship programs as a means of lasting recovery.3,7\n12-Step meeting attendance provides support for those in recovery from substance abuse and behavioral addictions. These and other mutual support groups (e.g., SMART Recovery) are common components of many individuals’ aftercare routine, following completion of formal, comprehensive rehabilitation.\nIndividual, Group and Family Therapy\nBehavioral therapies—a grouping that may encompass the modalities outlined on this page as well as additional ones not covered here—are the most commonly utilized forms of substance abuse treatment.8 While individual treatment program designs will vary, these types of therapies are likely to be administered in some combination of individual, group, and/or family counseling settings.\nIndividual therapy provides important one-on-one time with a therapist or counselor. Solo sessions with a therapist or counselor create a safe space to share personal issues, and can further serve as opportunities to more closely evaluate recovery progress and allow adjustments to be made to the treatment plan, when needed. In addition, coping skills that will help the client to avoid relapse beyond the treatment period can be honed during these sessions.\nGroup settings may constitute much of the total time spent in therapy while completing a rehab program. The group dynamic avails the wisdom gained by others on similar recovery journeys and can facilitate better interpersonal interaction as a recovering individual prepares to enter the “real world” at the completion of the treatment period.\nThere are many ways family members can give and receive support during their loved one’s treatment experience, and family therapy is one of them. Attending sessions together allows the family unit to begin healing broken relationships and build a solid foundation of trust once again.\nAddiction treatment pharmacotherapy—sometimes referred to as medication-assisted treatment (MAT)—constitutes the standard of care for certain types of substance use disorders, including opioid use disorder and alcohol use disorder. MAT combines FDA-approved pharmacotherapies (and, in some cases, off-label uses for other medications) with some combination of behavioral therapeutic interventions (such as the others mentioned throughout this article) to help people with long-term abstinence in recovery.\n- National Institute on Drug Abuse.

40	legal steps filing agency ruling challenge	To challenge an agency ruling, several legal requirements must be met. First, one must have legal standing, which requires showing: (1) a distinct and palpable injury, (2) the injury is traceable to the challenged conduct, and (3) the injury can be redressed if relief is granted. Organizations can establish standing either through direct injury (by showing resource diversion or mission frustration) or representational standing on behalf of affected members. The challenge must follow Administrative Procedure Act guidelines, which allows judicial review for any person 'suffering legal wrong' or 'adversely affected' by agency action. The basis for challenge would typically be that the agency action exceeded statutory authority or violated required rulemaking procedures, which include publishing notices in the Federal Register, allowing public comment periods, and providing explanation of the final rule's basis.	"['Relevant Bodies Of Law\nThere are a couple of types of legal standing (i.e. the right right to bring a lawsuit related to something because you are sufficiently connected to the dispute).\nAn individual has standing to sue concerning the validity of the law if it caused them actual injury or is imminently about to do so if implemented. So, anyone importer who is directly involved in a transaction with a Chinese company subject to the tariff would have standing to sue to declare the tariff ultra vires and invalid because it was beyond the statutory authority of the President to do. The U.S. Department of Justice summarizes the law of individual standing as follows:\nThe ""case or controversy"" clause of Article III of the Constitution\nimposes a minimal constitutional standing requirement on all litigants\nattempting to bring suit in federal court. In order to invoke the\ncourt\'s jurisdiction, the plaintiff must demonstrate, at an\n""irreducible minimum,"" that: (1) he/she has suffered a distinct and\npalpable injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the\ndefendant; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged\nconduct; and (3) it is likely to be redressed if the requested relief\nis granted. See Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for\nSeparation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 472 (1982);\nGladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 99 (1979);\nSimon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26, 37\n(1976). In addition to the constitutional requirements of Article III,\ncourts have developed a set of prudential considerations to limit\nstanding in federal court to prevent a plaintiff ""from adjudicating\n\'abstract questions of wide public significance\' which amount to\n\'generalized grievances\' pervasively shared and most appropriately\naddressed in the representative branches."" See Valley Forge, 454 U.S.\nat 474-75, quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499-500 (1975).\nSpeculative claims that a proposed governmental action may result in\ninjury to a plaintiff are insufficient to confer standing. See O\'Shea\nv. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 497 (1974). The required injury must be\nboth real and immediate, not conjectural or hypothetical. See Golden\nv. Zwickler, 394 U.S. 103, 109-10 (1969).\nAn association can sue on behalf of its members to have a statute or regulation declared to be invalid if an actual injury is suffered by one or more of its members and the injury is pertinent to the purpose of the organization. It can sometimes sue without a direct injury to its members as well if its mission is affected. The American Bar Association has a more precise premier with some case law references here. It explains that (internal block quotation in the original omitted):\nDirect Organizational Standing\nOrganizations have standing to challenge actions that cause them\ndirect injury. As the Supreme Court recognized in Havens Realty Corp.\nv. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363 (1982), direct organizational injury is\ntypically cognizable in two ways: (A) a diversion of organizational\nresources to identify or counteract the allegedly unlawful action, or\n(B) frustration of the organization’s mission. While most\njurisdictions require organizations to show only one of these forms of\ninjury to establish standing, some jurisdictions, notably the Ninth\nCircuit, require organizations to show both. Fair Hous. of Marin v.\nCombs, 285 F.3d 899, 905 (9th Cir. 2002).\nDiversion of resources. An organization may be able to establish\nstanding by showing that it diverted its resources to identify or\ncounteract a defendant’s allegedly unlawful actions. To satisfy the\nstanding requirement, organizations should be prepared to show that\nresources that could have otherwise been spent on fulfilling the\norganization’s goals were diverted to address the challenged policy or\npractice. Fair housing organizations, for example, have frequently\nbeen held to have standing based on their use of testers to identify\nallegedly discriminatory housing practices. A circuit split exists,\nhowever, concerning whether diverting resources to support litigation\nalone suffices to confer standing—in the D.C., Third, and Fifth\nCircuits, litigation expenses alone do not establish standing, while\nin the Second, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits they can.\nFrustration of mission. An organization can also establish standing by\nshowing a direct injury from conduct or policies that frustrate its\nmission. For example, in NYCLU v. N.Y.C. Transit Authority, 684 F.3d\n286 (2d Cir. 2011), the Second Circuit held that the NYCLU had\nstanding to challenge the New York City Transit Authority Board’s\nrefusal to allow access to its hearings. The denial of access, the\ncourt held, impeded the NYCLU’s ability to observe board hearings and\nthereby prepare to represent its clients before the board.\nEven in the absence of direct organizational standing, an organization\nmay be able to establish representational standing based on injuries\nto its members. Having a membership is, of course, essential to\nestablishing representational standing, and it is therefore\nparticularly useful for organizations such as unions, which frequently\nhave an interest in seeking redress on behalf of their members. An\norganization can establish representative standing by showing that at\nleast one of its members has standing, that the interests at stake are\ngermane to the organization’s purpose, and that neither the claim nor\nthe relief requires participation of the organization’s individual\nmembers. Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333,\nFederal regulations such as regulations establishing tariffs pursuant to an alleged statutory authorization must also be adopted in conformity with the\nAdministrative Procedures Act, which affords standard broader than that which would exist in its absence. As the EPA website explains (links to the statute added by me):\nThe Administrative Procedure Act (APA) governs the process by which\nfederal agencies develop and issue regulations. It includes\nrequirements for publishing notices of proposed and final rulemaking\nin the Federal Register, and provides opportunities for the public to\ncomment on notices of proposed rulemaking. The APA requires most rules\nto have a 30-day delayed effective date.\nIn addition to setting forth rulemaking procedures, the APA addresses\nother agency actions such as issuance of policy statements, licenses,\nand permits. It also provides standards for judicial review if a\nperson has been adversely affected or aggrieved by an agency action.\nSection 10(a) of the APA states that APA standing to review an agency decision is available in the following circumstances: ""Any person suffering legal wrong because of any agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by such action within the meaning of any relevant statute, shall be entitled to judicial review thereof.""\nThe basis of the challenge would be under Section 10(e)(3) because the regulation implementing the tariff was allegedly ""in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right"" and possibly also for other reasons.\nApplication Of Law To Facts\nAssuming that the American Chamber of Commerce has members who import goods covered by the tariffs in transactions from China, they would have standing to do so, although better practice would be to including some of those members individually as parties as well. So could any other group with members affected by the tariffs and a pertinent mission statement.\nIt is less obvious that an individual consumer who is not a party to the transaction upon which the tariff is imposed, or an organization representing such a consumer, would have standing as a result of the indirect injury arising from that consumer paying higher prices for goods subject to the tariff at retail.\nSimilarly, one cannot generally acquire standing in a case like this one merely because one is a voter or taxpayer with a generalized interest in the United States government acting in accordance with the law.\nSubject Matter Jurisdiction And Venue\nThere are also some technical questions over which federal court has jurisdiction to consider the matter.\nMany kinds of civil actions related to federal taxes that are brought before the tax has been paid must be filed in Tax Court (an article I court rather than a part of the judicial branch), but I don\'t know if that is the case with these tariffs.\nThere is also an Article III court called the Court of International Trade, in New York City, which is part of the Federal Circuit in the federal courts, that has jurisdiction over many international trade issues arising under federal law. This is probably a court with subject matter jurisdiction over this dispute.\nA U.S. District Court would have jurisdiction some in circumstances as well.\nThe Administrative Procedures Act does not itself specify which court is the proper court.\nBut, this technical issue is probably in excess of what is necessary to answer the question.', 'In a series of posts over the next few weeks, I’ll explore the process federal agencies use to create most federal “rules” or “regulations” (these terms are synonymous) that have the force and effect of law. See 5 U.S.C. § 551(4) & (5) (defining “rule” and “rule making,” respectively). Today’s post begins with an overview of this process, which is generally referred to as the “informal” or “notice-and-comment” rulemaking process.\nA provision of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 553, establishes the minimum procedural requirements that agencies must observe in informal rulemaking. This law requires that an agency:\n- Publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM or NOPR) in the Federal Register, to provide the public with essential information about the proceeding, including where and when it will occur, see 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(1), the legal authority under the which the agency proposes to act, see 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(2), and a description of the issues involved or the text of the proposed rule, see 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3);\n- Give the public an opportunity to comment on the proposal “through submission of written data, views, or arguments with or without the opportunity for oral presentation,” see 5 U.S.C. § 553(c); and\n- After considering public comments, publish the final rule in the Federal Register, along with a concise statement explaining the rule’s basis and purpose, see 5 U.S.C. § 553(c).\nThe courts have fleshed out these statutory minimum requirements over the years. Beyond these minimum requirements, however, agencies have wide discretion to tailor their own rulemaking procedures. See Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 435 U.S. 519 (1978).\nSection 553 exempts certain kinds of rules from notice-and-comment requirements. One of the exemptions allows agencies to adopt “interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules or agency organization, procedure or practice,” 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(A), without publishing an NPRM and providing an opportunity for public comment. Another exemption applies “when the agency for good cause finds . . . that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B).\nIn my next post, I’ll discuss some of the Administrative Conference’s previous recommendations related to informal rulemaking procedures, with a special emphasis on Recommendation 95-4, Procedures for Noncontroversial and Expedited Rulemaking, 60 Fed. Reg. 43,108 (Aug. 18, 1995).\nIn the meantime, further information about federal informal rulemaking under the APA is available in the following resources (listed in reverse chronological order):\nJeffrey S.

41	What happens when someone breaks export control laws, and how does this relate to the President's authority in foreign matters?	Violations of export control laws carry severe penalties: criminal violations of EAR can result in fines of $50,000-$1,000,000 or five times the export value and up to 10 years imprisonment, while ITAR violations can lead to $1,000,000 fines and 10 years imprisonment. Civil penalties range from $10,000-$120,000 for EAR and up to $500,000 for ITAR violations. This enforcement authority stems from the Constitution's framework where Congress has specific powers over commerce and can execute powers granted to other branches, while the President's executive power over foreign affairs is residual and does not extend to lawmaking or appropriations power.	"['126 Pages Posted: 16 Oct 2001 Last revised: 24 Oct 2016\nDate Written: September 1, 2001\nThis article argues for a comprehensive framework for the source and allocation of the foreign affairs powers of the U.S. government, based on the text of the Constitution. Modern scholarship, we believe, has too quickly given up on the Constitution\'s text as a tool for resolving foreign affairs controversies. This scholarship would have one believe that the Constitution contains enormous gaps and omissions in foreign affairs that must be filled by extratextual sources. In particular, the text is seen as largely unhelpful in addressing three seemingly intractable puzzles: (i) what is the source of foreign affairs powers conventionally believed to lie with the President - to direct and recall diplomats and act as the ""sole organ"" of communications with foreign nations - but apparently beyond the President\'s explicit textual powers; (ii) what is the source of Congress\' authority to regulate foreign affairs matters, such as the activities of U.S. citizens abroad, that do not seem encompassed by Congress\' enumerated powers; and (iii) how should one assess the source and allocation of foreign affairs powers not specifically mentioned in the text and claimed by both the President and Congress, such as the power to set foreign policy, enter into executive agreements, and terminate treaties.\nWe argue that the constitutional text, properly interpreted, provides a sound guide for resolving these matters. We derive four basic principles from the textual treatment of foreign affairs. First, the President has a ""residual"" foreign affairs power from Article II, Section 1\'s grant of ""the executive Power."" The executive power, as described by political theorists consulted by the framers - such as Locke, Montesquieu and Blackstone - included foreign affairs power. By using a common phrase infused with that meaning, the Constitution establishes a presumption that the President has the foreign affairs powers traditionally part of the executive power. Second, the framers thought the traditional executive had too great a power over foreign affairs, so they specifically allocated many key powers, in whole or in part, to other branches: war, commerce, treatymaking, etc. These are allocations away from the President, and thus, despite having the ""executive Power,"" the President cannot claim independent authority in these areas: the executive power over foreign affairs is only residual, extending to matters not otherwise covered in the text. Third, Congress has no general power over foreign affairs, but it has two textual sources of foreign affairs power: powers specifically given to it (such as war and commerce), and its power to carry into execution powers granted to other branches by the Constitution. The latter is a derivative power exercisable in conjunction with the President, to give effect to the President\'s executive power over foreign affairs. Finally, the President has broad residual power over foreign affairs, but that power does not extend to matters not part of the traditional executive power. Accordingly, the President cannot claim lawmaking or appropriations power in foreign affairs.\nHaving described these textual principles, we test our reading against the actual practice of the Washington administration. We find that this practice corresponded closely with the model we have derived from the text. President Washington exercised broad powers in foreign affairs without specific textual authorization, and without raising any serious objections. Washington, however, also observed the limits on the executive power over foreign affairs we suggest: he did not claim powers specifically allocated to other branches, nor did he claim lawmaking or appropriations power in support of his foreign affairs powers.\nSuggested Citation: Suggested Citation\nPrakash, Saikrishna and Ramsey, Michael D., The Executive Power Over Foreign Affairs (September 1, 2001). Yale Law Journal, Vol. 111, No. 231, 2001. Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=285988', 'Export Control Topics\nUnder both the Commerce Department\'s EAR and the State Department\'s ITAR, if research involves controlled technology or equipment, Columbia University may be required to obtain prior U.S. government approval (known as a license) before allowing foreign nationals to participate in the research, partnering with a foreign entity, or sharing (including by publication or presentation at conferences) the technology in any manner with foreign nationals. (""Foreign Nationals"" is defined as persons who are not U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents or legally-recognized asylees and refugees). As discussed in greater detail below, many University activities in the U.S. qualify for an ""exemption"" from or ""exceptions"" to export control regulations. Often this is because the information involved is publicly available or in the public domain, is considered ""fundamental research"" (as defined below), or is taught as part of a listed catalogue course at the institution. If an exception applies, no license is required.\nOne important question is whether the technology at issue is the ""output"" of Columbia research, or whether it is ""input technology"" that we receive from a third party. Examples of ""input technology"" include instrumentation or software we purchase; or unpublished technical specifications about an instrument used for research, including operating manuals, blueprints, drawings, photographs, plans, instructions or documentation; and materials licensed in or borrowed from a collaborator. The distinction between ""input"" and ""output"" technology matters because certain exceptions to export control regulations typically only apply to the output of University research, and do not apply to ""input technology."" Determining whether an instrument or technology is subject to export controls can involve a nuanced analysis. It may require obtaining information from the vendor that makes the instrument or technology. It may also require a technical comparison of the specifications for the instrument at issue against the descriptions of controlled technology in the Commerce and State Department lists. The lists are available here. Finally, the University has licensed a web-based tool called ""Visual Compliance"" that can facilitate classification.\nSharing export controlled information with a foreign national inside the U.S. is known as ""deemed export."" A deemed export occurs when technology or technical information regulated under the federal export control regulations is ""exported,"" not by shipping it overseas but by ""transferring"" it to a foreign national in the United States. If you receive export controlled information or technology from any external party, a license may be required from the federal government before the information or technology may be shared with a foreign national (as defined above). For this reason, if you receive any information that is marked or determined to be subject to export controls, you should not disclose it to any foreign national, including international students, without guidance from the Research Compliance Export Control Officer or the Office of the General Counsel.\nThe data and information generated through many University research activities may be exempted from export controls because of a general exception for ""Fundamental Research."" Fundamental Research is defined as ""basic and applied research in science and engineering, the results of which ordinarily are published and shared broadly within the scientific community, as distinguished from proprietary research and from industrial development, design, production, and product utilization, the results of which ordinarily are restricted for proprietary or national security reasons."" In accordance with University Statutes, research at Columbia is performed without accepting publication restrictions and its results are ordinarily published (University Statute XLIII, Externally Funded Research and Instruction). As a result, most research conducted in the U.S. at Columbia meets the definition Fundamental Research, and the results of our research are typically excluded from the export regulations. Importantly, there are some limitations to the Fundamental Research exception. For example, the exception would not apply to research conducted under an agreement that restricts either publication or foreign national participation in the project. In addition, ""input technology"" that is subject to export controls can never be Fundamental Research. The exemption refers to ""data and information"" and not to tangible items that may be produced. Finally, in general, the Fundamental Research exception does not apply to research conducted outside the United States.\nExport controls also limit the ability to transport controlled equipment abroad, without obtaining U.S. federal government licenses. U.S. export laws are triggered even if a controlled item leaves the U.S. temporarily and even if the item is being transferred to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Columbia University in an overseas country. In addition, U.S. export laws are triggered when an item controlled under U.S. laws is sent from one foreign country to another. This is called a ""re-export."" Even where the export of an item to the host country does not require a license, the re-export of the item to another country could trigger the need for another round of review. In addition, host country export control regulations may also apply to technology being used outside the United States.\nColumbia researchers who travel outside the United States, whether to a conference, a Columbia Global Center, for field work, or to collaborate with another institution, must be aware that their laptops, mobile phones, and other electronic devices are subject to U.S. export controls. However, with the exception of travel to designated sanctioned countries, depending on the country of travel (see section on Economic Sanctions), individuals traveling outside the United States with personal electronic devices will generally not require a license, so long as the devices are: Routinely available from commercial vendors; Kept in the traveler\'s immediate control while outside the U.S.; and Brought back to the U.S. within one year of the initial departure. On the other hand, licenses are likely to be required for a device that holds encryption software or contains software, materials, or information that are themselves controlled under U.S. export controls.\nThose performing research or accessing export controlled items, technology or software at Columbia are responsible for understanding the controls applicable to their activities and the interplay with the various exceptions. This may involve reviewing the portfolio of items, technical information or software accessed or developed in research against the USML and CCL lists (found directly below), understanding the role of foreign nationals and the impact of travel outside the U.S., and reviewing any applicable exceptions. Often this involves a complex nuanced analysis. While the principal investigator is responsible for compliance in this area, the University - and in particular, the Office of Research Compliance and Training and the Office of the General Counsel - support the research community in this challenging area, and should be freely consulted for guidance and other assistance.\nPenalties for violation of export laws are severe, and can involve civil and criminal penalties for both the University and individuals. Criminal violations of EAR carry potential penalties of the greater of $50,000-$1,000,000 or five times the value of the export, and up to 10 years of imprisonment; civil penalties include fines of $10,000-$120,000. Criminal violations of ITAR can entail fines of up to $1,000,000 and up to 10 years\' imprisonment; civil penalties include fines of up to $500,000.\n- Export Control Overview Presentation\n- International Affairs Office (IAO) - CUMC\n- International Students and Scholars Office (ISSO) - MS\n- Certification Regarding the Release of Controlled Technology or Technical Data to Foreign Persons in the U.S.\n- Sponsored Projects Handbook\n- International Research and Service Projects: Risk Management Procedures\n- Export Control Guidance for Visa Applications\n- Office of General Counsel\n- Sponsored Projects Administration\n- Export Administration Regulations (EAR)\n- FAQs of Deemed Export Related Regulatory Requirements (DoC)\n- International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)\n- Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)\n- Specially Designated Nationals List (SDN)\n- U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\n- National Policy on the Transfer of Scientific, Technical and Engineering Information\n- Resource Guide to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\n- Council on Government Relations (COGR) Export Control Resources']"	['<urn:uuid:a30c6569-2ab4-4cc7-9ad6-5cc8911bd562>', '<urn:uuid:106ad2a0-0997-441c-aa6a-669ab1c0c304>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	20	98	1920
42	Can you explain how pasta has evolved from being a simple Asian dish to becoming a lighter, more refined Italian meal that we know today?	Pasta originated in China before 200 BCE as noodles, initially reserved for upper classes before becoming popular among working classes. When it reached Italy, it underwent significant refinement. For instance, at the American Academy in Rome, traditional heavy pasta dishes have been transformed into lighter versions - like meat cannelloni using minimal bechamel sauce, or eggplant being baked instead of fried in Tortiglioni alla Norma to maintain flavor integrity while making the dish lighter. The evolution culminated in the Italian 'pastaciutta' style - pasta served as the main component with just enough sauce, rather than drowning in it.	['Recipes from the Kitchen of the American Academy in Rome\nBy Christopher Boswell\nWith Elena Goldblatt\nPhotography by Annie Schlechter\nPasta is a behind-the-scenes tutorial into the way that pastas and sauces are made in the kitchen of the esteemed American Academy in Rome. As the author, Chef Christopher Boswell, explains:\nIn this book, recipes and sections function like building blocks. The fundamental techniques of one type of pasta or sauce will give you the tools to approach the next one…the book reflects the way we teach the interns. They start by making simple pasta dishes and progressively acquire the skills to make more complex ones.\nYet: Pasta is much, much more than “how to” book. The recipes, while remaining true to their authentic Italian roots, are unmistakably influenced by Chef Boswell’s time at Chez Panisse, and sparkle with a lightness and purity that one doesn’t normally expect from pasta.\nIn his meat cannelloni, for example, instead of layering the dish with béchamel sauce—the typical method—he adds only a small bit of besciamella to the meat to bind the mixture. In Tortiglioni alla Norma, a dish in which eggplant is traditionally fried, here it is baked to maintain the integrity of the eggplant flavor, while lightening up the dish.\nThe approach makes pasta suddenly make sense even in hot months. Consider Bavette with White Fish and Pesto, in which the “pesto” contains no cheese or garlic, so is subtle, clean, and perfect on a warm day; as are the “handkerchiefs” tossed with pistachio, basil, a squeeze of lemon juice, and a grating of orange zest. Even lasagne has been transformed into a light and summery dish, and made quick and easy by Boswell’s trick that cuts prep time dramatically.\nWith such elegance on the plate, it’s easy to forget that these are dishes designed to feed a large hungry group (the staff, scholars, and artists working at the American Academy in Rome) so the recipes are necessarily economical and practical: two virtues that any cook will cherish. There are dozens of vegetarian recipes, too.\nThere are many other delights in the book: the unexpected flavor pairings (asparagus and basil); the anecdotes that make Chef Boswell a fun presence in the kitchen; the basic recipes and techniques that any cook will find invaluable; the surprises (a white Puttanesca, dishes in which cheese and fish work together); easy variations that can transform a recipe as familiar as spaghetti and meatballs into something entirely different; and last but not least, the spirit of la dolce vita that infuses every page.\nAbout the Authors\nChristopher Boswell is the executive chef of the Rome Sustainable Food Project. He has been at the RSFP since the program was established in 2006, when he was chosen by Alice Waters to work with former RSFP executive chef, Mona Talbott. He started out as a dishwasher and a prep cook in the small gold-rush town of Jackson, California. After high school, he attended the California Culinary Academy where he received the distinguished Daniel Carlisle Walker Award for culinary excellence. He then went on to work at the restaurants Stars, Acquarello, and One Market before moving to Italy for a year to learn authentic Italian rustic cooking. Boswell then joined Chez Panisse, where he received five years of intensive training under Alice Waters and her brigade of distinguished chefs.\nElena Goldblatt has always had a passion for cooking. She moved to her mother’s native Rome when she was 12 years old, and has been drawn back ever since. She graduated from Yale University in 2010 and was an intern in the Rome Sustainable Food Project kitchen in 2011. She worked for author and journalist Mark Bittman at The New York Times before returning to Rome to work with Chef Christopher Boswell on the RSFP cookbooks Pasta.\nAbout the Photographer\nAnnie Schlechter has been working as a photographer since 1998. Her clients include The World of Interiors, House Beautiful, The New York Times Magazine, Real Simple, W Magazine, Travel & Leisure, and many more.', '“Everything you see, I owe to spaghetti,” Sophia Loren once said. But to what does spaghetti owe?\nThere’s no denying that pasta is decidedly Italian. However, as is common with well-loved world cuisines, the origins of pasta are highly contested and may be found in many intersections of time and place. As Tori Avey writes in The History Kitchen, “The history of pasta is difficult to trace for several reasons. The word itself translates to ‘paste’ in Italian. This is a reference to the dough, made from a combination of flour and water or eggs – all simple components that have been around for centuries. This makes it hard to differentiate pasta from other ancient dishes made from the same ingredients. In addition, since pasta has long been a food of the common people, it has not received as much attention as more extravagant foods.”\nToday, we travel back in time – and around the world – to take a look at the possible origins of pasta.\nThe Marco Polo Legend\nThe most common – and as many historians argue, quite inaccurate – story about pasta is attributed to the legendary traveler Marco Polo. Noodles existed in China and Asia long before pasta appeared in the Mediterranean world, and the legend goes that Marco Polo brought pasta to Italy from China in the 13th century. Apparently, there are passages in The Travels of Marco Polo (by Marco Polo, of course) that refer to “pasta-like dishes.”\nAt the same time, historians note that Marco Polo’s familiarity with the food “pasta” suggests that it was already in existence, and he simply gave it a name. Food historian Harold McGee writes in his book, On Food and Cooking: “It’s a story often told, and often refuted, that the medieval traveler Marco Polo found noodles in China and introduced them to Italy. A recent book by Silvano Serventi and Francoise Sabban has set the record straight in authoritative and fascinating detail. China was indeed the first country to develop the art of noodle making, but there were pastas in the Mediterranean world long before Marco Polo.”\nEarly References to “Pasta”\nWhile it’s highly unlikely that Marco Polo brought pasta to Italy, it is believed that pasta as we know it made its way westward from Asia at an earlier time, perhaps by nomadic Arab traders. According to Culinary Lore, “There are written reports of ‘a food made from flour in the form of strings,’ in Sicily, described by an Arab trader named Idrisi in 1154, well before Marco Polo’s travels. There were even noodles called rishta in the Middle East, a food of Persian origin. Also, at the Spaghetti Museum in Pontedassio, Imperia, there are several documents from 1240, 1279, and 1284 which refer to pasta, maccheroni, and vermicelli as known foods, well before Marco Polo’s return in 1292.”\nFurthermore, it is suggested that rishta became popular in Sicily, due to the high number of Arab traders on the island. It is believed that rishta came to Italy via the Silk Road, the well-worn trading path from Asia to Europe.\nThe Art of Noodles in China\nLong, long before pasta was a twinkle in the eye of Italy, some time before 200 BCE, the northern Chinese were already developing the art of noodle making. References to noodles and dumplings (precursors for ravioli perhaps?) appear throughout historical Chinese texts, such as an ode from 300 CE by Shu Xi (McGee notes that “poets frequently likened their appearance and texture to the qualities of silk”) and in a 544 CE document that outlines a number of flour-products, including wheat noodles.\nThough noodles – mian or mien in Chinese (hence lo mien) – began as a dish reserved for upper classes in northern China, over time they became a popular food among working classes. By the 7th or 8th century, McGee writes that noodles made their way to Japan, where they are called men (hence, ramen).\nPasta in the Middle East & Mediterranean\nIn the 9th century, a Syrian text mentions itriya, dough that is shaped into strings and dried. Could this be a precursor to Sophia Loren’s spaghetti? Later, in 11th century Paris, the term vermicelli (with verm from Latin for worm) was used to describe very thin pastas. In the 13th century, macaroni was first used to describe “various shapes, from flat to lumpy.”\nDuring the medieval period, “cooks made some pastas from fermented doughs; they cooked pasta for an hour or more until it was very moist or soft; they frequently paired it with cheese, and used it to wrap around fillings” (McGee).\nPasta in Italy\nThough pasta’s origins are varied and can be traced to different parts of the world, it is widely agreed that the evolution of pasta into the form we now know and love was perfected in the post-medieval period in Italy. McGee writes, “Pasta makers formed guilds and made fresh types from soft wheat flour throughout Italy, dried types from durum semolina in the south and in Sicily. Italian cooks developed the distinctive preparation called pastaciutta, or ‘dry pasta,’ pasta served as the main component of a dish, moistened with sauce but not drowning in it or dispersed in a soup or stew.”\nBy the 18th century, pasta was widely produced throughout Italy and was a common food amongst all classes of society. In the late 19th century, the term al dente – to the tooth – was first used to describe the perfect texture for pasta.\nHere at Cucina Toscana, we are proud to serve authentic Italian pasta dishes!

43	environmental changes impact farming eagles migration	Environmental changes are affecting both agricultural systems and wildlife migration patterns. Climate change has altered bald eagles' migratory patterns, pushing them from southern to northeastern states. Meanwhile, agricultural systems are facing challenges due to changing environmental conditions, with yield production forecasted to decrease. Traditional farming requires considerable space and resources, contributing to the shrinking of available land. Vertical farming has emerged as an alternative that can operate independently of external conditions, using controlled environments for year-round crop production while potentially preserving natural habitats for wildlife like migratory birds.	['From 2015 to 2019, an average of four birds per year came to Lake Buchanan—less than half of the 10.4 average for the five years before that. Could the noise from hunters be to blame?\nTim Mohan is intimately familiar with Lake Buchanan, the northernmost of the six Highland Lakes that squiggle through the Hill Country toward Austin. The outdoorsman can point out all the most interesting spots: Barringer Hill, on Buchanan’s western side, where rare earth metals were discovered in 1886 but later were lost to the lake; Buzzards Roost Creek, where turkey vultures catch warm thermals in their unyielding quest for carrion; and the intermittent waterfall aptly dubbed Seldom Falls.\nMost importantly, Mohan, a tour guide for Vanishing Texas River Cruises near the town of Burnet, knows about the bald eagles. Each year starting in November, the birds arrive from North America’s frigid northern expanses to temporarily roost in the scrub brush dotting Lake Buchanan’s austere canyon faces. Some are juveniles still honing their dive-bomb fishing technique; others are majestic, white-faced adults with eight-foot wingspans. “If you could see one of these mature birds, it’s phenomenal,” Mohan says. “It just knocks your socks off.”\nOn a chilly November morning, Mohan sits at the bow of a two-deck cruise vessel, binoculars in hand and a microphone affixed to his cheek. The boat charts a path northward as he regales the 60 or so passengers with trivia about the lake’s history (it was created by damming the Colorado River in 1939) and dimensions (measuring 31 miles long and five miles wide, it’s the largest of the Highland Lakes). But the spiel is merely a warm-up act for the main event: the bald eagles.\nThe problem is, there aren’t many to see today.\nAbout halfway through the three-hour tour, there are no eagles to be found. Mohan’s frustration starts to show. “I’m more than a little irritated we haven’t spotted any yet,” he tells the passengers. “That’s just not right.” After all, the bald eagles are what folks come to see from across the state. Streets and housing developments in Burnet are named after our national bird; eagle-themed shirts, koozies, and wine stoppers are sold in the lakefront gift shop; even this vessel is named the Texas Eagle.\nMohan and others familiar with the visiting bald eagles say that their numbers on the lake seem to be dwindling. Annual surveys show that the birds’ population has fallen to the lowest numbers since tracking efforts began in the late 1970s. From 2015 to 2019, an average of four birds per year came to Lake Buchanan—less than half of the 10.4 average for the five years before that. And no one’s exactly sure why. Climate change has messed with the birds’ migratory patterns, pushing eagles from southern to northeastern states. But a theory is also being floated that hunters illegally shooting ducks on Lake Buchanan may also be driving the eagles away. “Last year, their numbers were down considerably. We speculated if it wasn’t due to duck hunters,” Mohan says.\nIt’s not just idle speculation—Mohan and Shawn Devaney, the boat’s captain, have seen duck hunters setting up blinds both on the shoreline and in the water, despite rules prohibiting hunting in the area. And last year, Mohan says, a hunting party let off a shot just as the boat passed. “It was loud. You could tell it was a shotgun going off.” Devaney notes that it’s impossible to know to what degree hunters are contributing to the decline in the number of birds in the area, “but a bunch of shotguns going off while eagles are trying to roost isn’t good.”\nThere’s evidence to suggest that loud noises could drive the birds away, especially in a river canyon where tall walls echo and amplify noises. Near Chicago in 2012, environmentalists cried foul when police proposed a new shooting range adjacent to wetlands where bald eagles nest; they said gun noises could put the city in violation of federal law prohibiting disturbing the birds (the eagles prevailed and the range wasn’t built). At the University of Minnesota, researchers are using sounds to drive bald eagles away from wind turbines, which endanger the birds during their annual migration. This year, university researchers in Ireland showed that noise created by humans has an outsized effect on birds and other species. “Consequently, anthropogenic noise must be considered as a serious form of environmental change and pollution,” it said.\nAlthough the number of bald eagles roosting at Lake Buchanan seems to be dropping, nationwide the population is thriving. For the most part, the species has made a remarkable recovery since the 1970s, when it teetered on the brink of extinction. At that time, eagles were being killed by fisherman trying to protect their catches. They were also ravaged by the now-outlawed pesticide DDT, which was ingested by fish and then passed onto the eagles that ate them, making their eggs too fragile for chicks to reliably hatch.\nIn 1972, DDT was banned in the United States. One year later, the federal Endangered Species Act was passed and the bald eagle was listed as being endangered, granting it new protections. In the decades since, their numbers have bounced back so drastically that bald eagles were removed from the endangered species list in 1997. The laws, however, still forbid people from engaging in activities that would “disturb” the birds from breeding, feeding, or taking shelter.\nThe Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA), which owns Lake Buchanan and the other Highland Lakes, forbids hunting on its water and land. A spokesperson told the Observer that it wasn’t aware of any duck hunting happening at Buchanan. LCRA employs “rangers” to police the lake, but citing “security reasons,” the spokesperson would not answer questions regarding how many of them are assigned to Buchanan or how frequently they patrol. Cody Hatfield, a supervisory state game warden who oversees compliance with state hunting rules in Burnet and surrounding counties, also said he hasn’t seen duck hunters on the lake—but he admits he doesn’t patrol the lake itself.\nCharles Tishcler, who’s conducted the annual count of bald eagles every year since 1979, has seen the hunters. The first time was in 2015, when he spotted one wielding a “long-barreled goose gun” on a boat in the Canyon of the Eagles. Since then, he’s spied more: “They have their duck decoys out and it’s just like, boom, boom, boom. You’ve got three guys with automatic shotguns and it turns into quite the tune,” he says.\nTischler said he reported the hunting activity to LCRA and to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, which regulates hunting in the state. Nothing ever came of it, he says. Tischler fears that if officials allow hunting to continue in this area, the eagles may decide to roost somewhere else completely—leaving this rugged and wild part of the state without its seasonal mascot. “I thought we’d lose the eagles to straight-out [housing] development,” he says. “I never saw this coming.”\nBack on the Texas Eagle, from the second deck, Devaney announces over a loudspeaker that he may have spotted the first bald eagle of the day: a juvenile, resting in a copse of cottonwood atop a cliff to the west. Tourists rush to the window to catch a glimpse, but even with binoculars, the bird was just a blip in the sky. Was it a trick of the eye? Hard to say. Later on, after the boat turned south to return to shore, Devaney spots another one. This is a definitive sighting: a brown-feathered juvenile racing south, blurring past juniper and cacti. The passengers watch in wonder until the bird comes to rest on a branch, immediately blending in with the canyon wall.\nAlmost as quickly as it appeared, the eagle vanishes.\nRead more from the Observer:\nAs Port Neches Plant Smolders, Trump Rolls Back Safety Rules for Chemical Plants: After a deadly explosion in the town of West in 2013, Obama implemented stricter safety rules for chemical plants.

With a growing population and resource needs, the availability of arable land is shrinking rapidly.\nSince the agricultural revolution, conventional agriculture has focused on practices requiring considerable quantities of space, water, fertilizer, and pesticides. The past 50 years have seen an accelerating rate of increase in these requirements as modern food production aims to increase productivity in the hopes of addressing growing food insecurity.\nLooking into the future, yield production is forecasted to decrease due to widespread environmental and socioeconomic changes that will generate unpredictable consequences on food systems.\nIn response, many strategies have been developed as alternatives to conventional agricultural practices. These strategies have focused on key principles and their combination to be effective: require less space, less water, and increase yield per unit of area. Moreover, due to the negative effects of agrichemicals, modern practices have also aimed to use significantly less to avoid potentially adverse effects for humans and animals.\nOne such alternative is the development of vertical agriculture, also referred to as vertical farming. As the name implies, vertical agriculture relies on expanding production vertically and not horizontally. Vertical agriculture is a multilayer indoor plant production system that allows for precise control of growth factors, such as light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, water, and nutrients.\nThis allows for the growing and production of crops year-round, completely independent of solar light and other external conditions. Indeed, vertical agriculture makes use of key concepts within ecology and physiology to optimize growing and fertilization within controlled conditions. For instance, elements of photobiology, thermomorphogenesis, hydroponics, and genetic breeding, are all used commonly across systems of vertical agriculture.\nBenefits, challenges, and disadvantages moving from horizontal to vertical farming\nAs a result of tight control over crop breeding, growing, and harvesting, vertical farming provides several benefits relative to conventional methods of ‘horizontal’ food production. This was the topic of a literature review by Kalantari et al. published in 2016 in the Journal of Landscape Ecology.\nFrom a systems perspective, the enclosed design prevents pests and diseases from entering by the adoption of a high level of hygiene, continuous monitoring, and non-chemical disinfection, providing security from crops. Moreover, recent technology has also allowed for automated control over environmental conditions by using sensors and imaging techniques in combination with crop simulation models and artificial intelligence, limiting the need for physical labor.\nVertical farming also allows for flexible organization, with designs ranging from large vertical walls covered with crops to large hangars or re-used shipping containers that can be transported. Consequently, vertical agricultural systems, can comprise many varying sizes and be located within many different areas from the middle of highly urbanized cities to more suburban or rural areas.\nMoreover, the verticality element of this system also provides nutrient and water flow, helping to reuse costly resources. The reduction in space also means there is a significant increase in yield per area, holding extensive potential for a future world of urbanization.\nFrom an economic perspective, vertical farming also provides for more jobs in localized areas and is community-focused by addressing the needs of immediate areas, which in turn can provide food at a lower price. Finally, the optionality of location for vertical systems also allows producers to reduce transport costs, as consumers may access them within urban areas, or transport can be minimized to nearby areas.\nHowever, despite the design, environmental, and economic advantages, vertical farming also incorporates several issues that remain a challenge to its broader implementation as a system.\nVertical farming has a high energy requirement and needs extensive investment costs to implement and develop successfully. Moreover, indoor issues relating to excessive UV, heat, and ozone-induced plant damage may have unpredictable repercussions for plant growth.\nAdditionally, vertical systems are difficult to adapt to a larger scale. They are costly to build and maintain and have yet to demonstrate the ability to provide food for larger areas than community-scale populations. This would make it difficult to implement in areas at higher risk of food insecurity, such as developing agricultural nations.\nThe lack of empirical research on a broader scale has meant that vertical farming has yet to develop past the concept stage on community levels, as persistent issues make it difficult to break through to a larger scale.\nImage Credit: YEINISM/Shutterstock.com\nGrowing skywards - the implications of vertical farming in a rapidly populating and changing world\nAmong the development of alternative agricultural practices, vertical agriculture provides a promising solution for many of the challenges facing current agricultural policies. However, for vertical systems to be integrated on a larger scale requires further technological progress and economic investment.\nNevertheless, gradually implementing more verticality, or combining it with other practices aiming for more sustainable practices may be promising. For instance, the combination of verticality with other practices such as intercropping may be particularly beneficial for developing more sustainable food systems.\nIncorporating technological progress into vertical systems also holds promise, with automated sensors and machinery able to operate near-independently. Progress in gene editing and plant genome modifications will also allow for faster, bigger, and healthier crops, allowing vertical agriculture to produce more over time.\nThroughout agricultural history, farming systems have typically spread over large spans of land, yet the reduction in arable land, as well as the increase in demand to house growing populations, means that such strategies need to be reconsidered, and vertical agriculture may play a role looking into the future.\nContinue Reading: Benefits of Vertical Agriculture and Hydroponics\n- Beacham, A.

44	Could you explain how the biceps muscle works in the arm and what are the different benefits of using resistance bands versus traditional weights for bicep exercises?	The biceps brachii is a two-headed muscle in the upper arm that performs three main functions: flexing the elbow, rotating the forearm to turn the palm face-up (supination), and helping flex the shoulder joint. It originates from the shoulder blade and connects to the radius bone below the elbow. When using resistance bands for bicep exercises, they offer unique benefits compared to traditional weights. Bands provide constant tension throughout the movement, help correct imbalances between arms when doing one-arm exercises, and allow for easy progression by either stretching the band further or adding multiple bands. Additionally, resistance bands are particularly effective for improving form, as users can check their technique in a mirror and focus on slow, controlled movements for better strength gains.	['Learn something new every day More Info... by email\nThe biceps brachii is a muscle located in the upper arm that flexes the elbow joint and rotates the forearm so the palm of the hand turns face-up, an action known as supination. It originates on the top of the shoulder blade, runs along the front of the upper arm, and inserts at the radius bone in the forearm just below the elbow. A Latin term meaning “two-headed muscle of the arm,” biceps brachii refers to the muscle’s defining physical characteristic: Two separate sections, or heads, that originate at separate points on the shoulder blade and converge into a single tendon that crosses the elbow joint.\nCommonly referred to as simply “the biceps,” the biceps brachii is primarily responsible for rotating the forearm when the elbow is flexed; when the arm is straight the supinator muscle of the forearm rotates the palm up. It plays an additional role in flexing the elbow, in which it assists the brachialis muscle, which lies beneath the biceps, and it is also involved in flexing the shoulder joint. As such, the biceps brachii performs actions at three arm joints: The proximal, or upper, radioulnar joint, the humeroulnar or elbow joint, and the glenohumeral or shoulder joint.\nThere are two types of strength-training exercises recommended for strengthening and adding size to the biceps muscle — compound exercises and isolated exercises. Compound exercises involve multiple muscles and joints, and those that work the biceps brachii include the chin-up, dumbbell rows and barbell rows, and the inverted or bodyweight row. In all of these exercises, the biceps act as a secondary muscle to the muscles of the upper back, but because each exercise requires flexing the elbow joint, the biceps can be more or less involved depending on the type of grip used.\nThe best known isolated biceps exercise, isolated in that it focuses on a single muscle group, is the biceps curl. This exercise can be performed using dumbbells or a barbell, but fitness experts mostly recommend the dumbbell curl because it allows for rotation of the forearm. It is also recommended to either alternate arms or simply curl one arm at a time, as it minimizes the risk of using the low back to help lift the weights.\nTo perform the dumbbell curl, one should stand with a dumbbell in each hand and grip neutral, or palms facing inward. He should then begin to curl the weight toward the shoulder, supinating the forearm as the elbow bends so that the palm faces inward and making sure to hold the upper arm tight to the body. Once the elbow is fully flexed, he should slowly lower the weight back to the starting position without swinging the dumbbell or allowing for momentum from gravity. Recommendations for sets, repetitions, and rest periods can vary depending on the desired result, so anyone training the biceps brachii should contact a fitness professional for more information.\nOne of our editors will review your suggestion and make changes if warranted. Note that depending on the number of suggestions we receive, this can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Thank you for helping to improve wiseGEEK!', 'Are you struggling to effectively target your biceps during your workouts? Are traditional bicep curls with dumbbells becoming too easy and not pushing you to your limits? Fear not, because you’re not alone. Many people have found themselves in this exact same situation. Perhaps you’ve been using weights that are too light, or you simply need to switch up your routine. Luckily, the solution is right at your fingertips: resistance band one arm bicep curls. In this post, we’ll dive into the benefits of incorporating resistance bands into your bicep routine and show you how to properly perform the one arm bicep curl with this simple yet effective tool.\nResistance Band One Arm Bicep Curls Summary\n- Primary Muscles: Biceps Brachii\n- Secondary Muscles: Brachialis, and Brachioradialis\n- Equipment: Resistance Band\n- Mechanics Type: Isolation\n- Force: Pull\n- Utility: Auxiliary\nResistance Band One Arm Bicep Curls Instructions\n- Secure the resistance bands to your anchor point down at the floor.\n- While facing away from the anchor point grab the handles with both hands.\n- The arm you are training should be extended to your side, and the other arm should pull the band tight. Now with you palm facing forward pull with your bicep to curl your arm.\n- Squeeze at the top and hold for a brief moment.\n- After then return your arm to the starting point.\n- Repeat for this arm 8-12 reps and then switch.\nResistance Band One Arm Bicep Curls Muscles\nBenefits of Resistance Band One Arm Bicep Curls\nResistance Band One Arm Bicep Curls are a great exercise for targeting the biceps brachii, one of the main muscles in the arm. This exercise strengthens the biceps brachii by using resistance bands to provide extra resistance during the curl. The resistance bands make the exercise more challenging and can help to increase strength, muscle size, and tone. Additionally, because the movement is unilateral (one arm at a time), it helps to even out any imbalances between both arms. Resistance Band One Arm Bicep Curls are a great way to add variety to your strength training routine and help build strong, toned biceps.\nTips for Performing Resistance Band One Arm Bicep Curls\nWhen you wish to attain the most beneficial results, adhere to these basic tips. Similarly, if you desire to reduce the likelihood of injuries, abide by these tips.\n- Use Multiple Bands To Help to Increase The Challenge. When you are easily performing 12 or more reps every exercise, then you need to raise the resistance. You can either do this by stretching the band further at the beginning of the movement or by using more bands. The recommended method is to add more bands given that it is easily repeatable to have a similar resistance on each workout.\n- Use A Mirror To Check Your Technique. You could think you are a little vain looking in a mirror while you are exercising, but you are not admiring yourself, you are insuring your technique is solid.\n- Slow Every Repetition Down For Improved Strength Gains. By Raising the time under tension you are exercising your muscles more and they will respond by developing stronger muscles. You can accomplish this without raising the weight by doing slow reps about 4 – 6 seconds flexing and pause then 4 – 6 seconds relaxing.\nBenefits and Tips Video\nFrequent Mistakes To Avoid\nYou ought to keep away from these typical mistakes to have ideal form and improved tonning. Furthermore\n- Don’t Allow Yourself To Cheat. In the majority of the time, cheating is applying momentum rather than the strain of your target muscle tissue. Once in a while, a little cheating on your last rep can be great to overload your muscle, although not for more than a handful of reps.\n- Stop Yourself From Using Too Little or Too Much Tension. Not enough, and you will not be sufficiently employing your target muscle, excess, and you’ll probably cheat. Ensure that you can conduct between 8-12 reps with correct technique.\nFind More Resistance Band Exercises Here\nVariations and Complementary Exercises\nIf you’re looking to vary up your routine or add more intensity, there are several other exercises you can incorporate in place of or in addition to Resistance Band One Arm Bicep Curls. Below are some variations, complementary exercises, and alternative exercises that can help you switch things up while still targeting your biceps.\nThe Concentration Curl is a great alternative or complementary exercise to Resistance Band One Arm Bicep Curls. It is an isolation exercise that specifically targets the bicep muscle, making it great for building strength and size. The exercise involves sitting on a bench with one arm resting on the inner thigh and the weight in the other hand. As you curl the weight up towards your shoulder, be sure to keep your upper arm still and keep your elbow tucked in. This will help you to really target the bicep muscle and ensure that you are getting the most out of this exercise.\nReverse Grip Cable Curls\nReverse grip cable curls are an excellent alternative or complementary exercise to Resistance Band One Arm Bicep Curls. This exercise involves holding a cable with an overhand grip and curling the weight up towards the shoulder. The use of the cable allows for continuous tension on the biceps, providing an effective way to build strength and muscle mass. The reverse grip increases the level of difficulty as it requires more control and stability of the muscles. This exercise can be adjusted to target different parts of the biceps, depending on the position of your hands. Reverse grip cable curls are a great way to add variety to your bicep workouts and help you reach your fitness goals faster.\nRope Cable Hammer Curl\nThe Rope Cable Hammer Curl is a great complementary or alternative exercise to the Resistance Band One Arm Bicep Curl. It is an isolation exercise that works the biceps and forearms, as well as the shoulder muscles. The exercise involves gripping a rope handle attached to a cable pulley and curling it up towards the shoulder. It requires more control than the Resistance Band One Arm Bicep Curl and targets the biceps from a different angle. It also allows for more resistance than the band exercise, which increases the intensity of the workout.\nCheck Out These Top Resistance Band Exercises\nCable Straight Bar Curls\nCable Straight Bar Curls are a great complementary or alternative exercise to Resistance Band One Arm Bicep Curls. This exercise is done with a cable machine, which provides a consistent amount of resistance throughout the full range of motion, making it ideal for targeting the biceps. Additionally, the cable bar allows you to use both arms at once, which increases the intensity of the exercise. Furthermore, this exercise encourages you to use proper form and can help strengthen your wrists and forearms in addition to your biceps.\nResistance Band Hammer Curls\nResistance Band Hammer Curls are an excellent alternative or complementary exercise to Resistance Band One Arm Bicep Curls. This exercise is performed by holding the band in both hands and curling your arms at the same time. This exercise targets the biceps, forearms, and shoulders, allowing you to get a full body workout. It is an effective exercise for building strength and size in the arms and upper body. The resistance bands also provide extra resistance to help you challenge your muscles even further. Resistance Band Hammer Curls are a great way to mix up your routine and add variety to your workouts.\nResistance Band Reverse Grip Curls\nResistance Band Reverse Grip Curls is a great complementary exercise to Resistance Band One Arm Bicep Curls. It works the same muscles but in a slightly different way. This exercise targets the biceps, the forearms, and the shoulder muscles. To perform this exercise, place the resistance band under both feet and hold onto the handles with an overhand grip. Keep your elbows close to your body as you curl up and down, making sure to keep your shoulders and arms relaxed. This exercise can be used as an alternative to Resistance Band One Arm Bicep Curls or as a way to increase intensity when combined with it.\nFind More Arms Exercises Here\nOpposing Complementary Exercises\nTo maximize the effectiveness of your workout, it is important to include exercises that work opposing muscle groups. Complementing the exercise Resistance Band One Arm Bicep Curls with exercises that target the opposite muscles can help create balance in your body and prevent injury. Below are a few exercises that are great for targeting the opposing muscle groups of the Resistance Band One Arm Bicep Curls:\nResistance Band Anchored Tricep Kickbacks\nResistance Band Anchored Tricep Kickbacks are a great exercise to complement Resistance Band One Arm Bicep Curls. This exercise works the opposing muscle group of the biceps, the triceps, by targeting the back of the upper arm. The tricep kickback is a great way to complete your upper arm workout since it works the opposing muscle group while helping to increase strength and definition in your arms. By completing both exercises, you will be able to get a full workout for your upper arms in a short amount of time.\nResistance Band Tricep Kickbacks\nResistance Band Tricep Kickbacks are a great way to work the opposing muscle group to Resistance Band One Arm Bicep Curls. This exercise specifically targets the triceps, working them to their full potential. To perform this exercise, stand with your feet hip-width apart and hold a resistance band in one hand. Bend forward slightly at the hips and engage your core. Keeping your elbow bent, extend your arm behind you until it is parallel with the ground. Then, slowly return your arm back to the starting position. This exercise is a great way to strengthen and tone your triceps, making it the perfect complement to Resistance Band One Arm Bicep Curls.\nResistance Band Push Downs\nResistance Band Push Downs are the perfect complement to Resistance Band One Arm Bicep Curls as they focus on the opposing muscle group. Resistance Band Push Downs work the triceps and help to create strength and definition in the back of the upper arm. To perform this exercise, stand with both feet on the resistance band and grasp it with both hands. Keeping your elbows close to your body, push down and slowly return to the starting position. This exercise will help to create balance between the biceps and triceps and give you a more toned upper arm.\nMaster Your Biceps With One Arm Resistance Band Curls!\nOne way to get the most out of your resistance band bicep curls is to focus on your form. Make sure to keep your elbow tucked in to your side and your wrist straight as you curl the band up towards your shoulder. Also, try doing one arm curls at a time to really isolate and work your biceps. Using a resistance band can provide a challenging workout and help you build stronger, toned arms. Don’t be afraid to switch up your routine and try different variations of the exercise to keep things interesting and avoid hitting a plateau.\nReferences: Wikipedia | ExRx.net | PubMed.gov | Comprehensive List of Arms Resistance Band Exercises']	['<urn:uuid:2ab66ef9-d0e8-43c5-94c2-3369d6dfc882>', '<urn:uuid:bbef9ee4-433a-4194-95af-2af0489b1322>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	27	123	2422
45	what are the main methods used to remove iron from silica sand in industrial processing	There are five main methods used to remove iron from silica sand: 1) Mechanical scrubbing, which uses external force and friction between sand particles, 2) Magnetic separation, which can be done through dry or wet selection, 3) Ultrasonic iron removal, which removes secondary iron film from particle surfaces, 4) Flotation iron removal, which includes the widely-used fluorine acid method, and 5) Acid leaching, which works because quartz is insoluble in most acids while iron-containing minerals can be dissolved.	['Removing iron from silica in sand washing processing\nSilica sand is an important non-metallic mineral raw material with a wide range of uses. The content of quartz sand iron directly affects the quality of the product. This paper mainly introduces the advantages and disadvantages of mechanical scrubbing and iron removal, magnetic separation, ultrasonic iron removal, flotation iron removal and acid pickling. With the development of microelectronics, optoelectronics and other industries, the excellent performance of high-purity quartz sand makes other powders irreplaceable, and the market prospect is extremely broad.\nsilica sand production plant\nQuartz sand, also known as silica sand, glass sand is an important non-metallic mineral raw material widely used in glass, casting, ceramics and refractory materials, metallurgy, construction, chemicals, plastics, rubber, abrasives and other industries. Fengyang quartz sand is mainly used to manufacture glass, and the content of iron in quartz sand directly affects the quality of the product. The purity requirement of quartz sand in high-tech field is harsh: generally requires SIO2 content greater than 99.99%, impurity content, especially The content of iron impurities is limited to a very low range, so it is very important to increase the taste of quartz sand in the production process to reduce the content of iron.\nIn silica sand, the main mineral is quartz, and it also contains some other impurity minerals. The impurity minerals containing iron are hematite, magnetite, goethite and so on. These iron-containing impurities are either embedded in the quartz particles or attached to the quartz surface. Because the presence of these iron-containing impurities greatly reduces the use-value of quartz sand, affecting the quality of the product, such as in the production of glass, iron-containing impurities will cause greater harm to the production and quality of the glass, especially for glass melting. The thermodynamic properties of the process and the light transmission of the finished glass. Currently used in iron removal technology mainly have the following methods:\nMechanical scrubbing is the removal of iron from the surface of quartz sand and iron-containing minerals adhering to the surface of quartz sand by means of mechanical external force and collision and friction between sand particles. Currently, scrubbing techniques are primarily rod scrubbing and mechanical scrubbing. Compared with other iron removal processes, the process has the following characteristics: First, the product quality is good, and the quality requirements of float glass for high-quality silica sand can be achieved; second, the output is large. Now some small-scale production and processing companies use this method to remove more iron because it is cheaper and easier to operate, but the iron removal rate is relatively low.\n2. Magnetic separation to remove iron from silica sand\nMagnetic separation is divided into a dry selection and wet selection. The comparison between dry selection and wet selection shows that the wet magnetic separation has the defects of large magnetic consumption, easy wear of the medium, large production water consumption, high operation, maintenance cost. The dry strong magnetic separation process is easy to operate, and the operation and maintenance costs are lower than the wet type. In the magnetic separation process, the wet magnetic separator can remove the weak magnetic impurity minerals such as hematite, limonite, and biotite including the continuum particles.\n3. Ultrasonic iron removal\nUltrasonic iron removal is primarily a secondary iron film (ie, “thin-film iron”) that removes the surface of the particles. The iron film is firmly bonded and the mechanical scrubbing method used in the beneficiation cannot be separated.\n4. Flotation and iron removal\nThe flotation method can be divided into three types: the first one is a fluorine acid method. This method is widely used because of its good flotation effect, easy control, and stable index.\n5. Acid leaching iron\nAcid leaching and iron removal The use of quartz is insoluble in acid (except HF), and the impurity mineral containing Fe can be dissolved by acid so that the purpose of removing iron-containing minerals from quartz sand can be achieved.']	['<urn:uuid:c200ae5e-c81e-4014-9abc-824b5754abf7>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	15	78	657
46	I'm planning a trip to Sicily and I love both wine and cycling. What are some interesting places I can visit in the southeast of Sicily, and what's special about the local Marsala wine I keep hearing about?	In southeastern Sicily, you can cycle through several UNESCO Heritage Sites including the beautiful Baroque towns of Modica, Ragusa, and Noto. You can ride along the Mediterranean coastal road to Capo Passero, passing pristine beaches and wildlife-rich areas like the Vendicari Natural Oasis. As for Marsala wine, it's a special fortified wine from western Sicily made primarily from local white grapes like Damaschino, Grillo, and Inzolia. It contains 15-20% alcohol and comes in different varieties - Gold (dry, perfect for cooking), Amber (sweeter, great as dessert wine), and Ruby (made from red grapes like Nero d'Avola). The wine develops distinctive notes of almonds, licorice, honey, and dried fruits through its unique production process.	"[""- Visiting the Baroque towns of Modica, Ragusa and Noto, all UNESCO Heritage Sites\n- Sampling delicious Sicilian pastries, like cannoli\n- Cycling along the beautiful coastal road to Capo Passero\n- Exploring the medieval streets of Ortigia di Siracusa\n- Enjoying an aperitivo ‘al fresco’ with the locals in one of the many piazzas\n- Discovering the astonishing Oasis of Vendicari\nYou will be met at Catania airport and transferred (approx 1.5 hours) to your accommodation in the charming town of Palazzolo Acreide.\nPalazzolo Acreide is an ancient town that was once the Greek city of Akrai. The town was rebuilt in 1693, and offers the perfect start to your tour of Baroque Sicily. After your briefing with our Sicilian rep, going through the route notes and providing you with useful tips;,the remainder of the day can be spent visiting the town of Palazzolo Acreide on foot, exploring the winding lanes of the medieval part of town. Famed for its Baroque architecture, the town is jam-packed with unmissable sights, like its Basilica of San Paolo and the Basilica of San Sebastiano, both of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n- Meals: Breakfast\n- Ascent: 515 Metres Approx.\nGrabbing your bikes, you’ll say ciao to Palazzolo Acreide. You have the option to first cycle to the Greek archaeological site of Akrai. Here take the opportunity to discover the ancient ruins, where you’ll find a Greek Theatre and the Temple of Aphrodite. The surrounding view of the Hybleaen mountains is stunning!\nGetting back on your bikes, you’ll cycle through Hyblaean territory to the hill-top city of Ragusa Ibla, making your way past ancient dry stone walls, through valleys with lush Mediterranean vegetation. Ragusa Ibla is not only another Baroque jem, but it was part of the film setting in the popular Inspector Montalbano’s TV series.\nThe last section of your ride will offer up an awe-inspiring descent into Modica, your destination for the evening. Modica, a UNESCO-listed city, sits majestically in a valley and is famed for its Duomo of St Giorgio which is well worth a visit.\n- Meals: Breakfast\n- Ascent: 260 Metres Approx.\nBefore heading away from Modica, we recommend a visit to the town’s famous Cioccolateria, to sample the famous chocoloate (Cioccolato di Modica), often described as the best Italian chocolate. Your ride will begin with a downhill stretch as you make your way to the charming town of Scicli. You’ll cycle through a fertile valley, with small quaint farm holds, carob and pomegranate plantations and small reservoirs, all with a back drop of terraced hills. In Scicili, take some time to explore the town and the enchanting Saint Bartholomew’s Church, which looks out over a rocky landscape of ever-changing colours. Wander its atmospheric streets, including Via Mormino Penna. It’s also worth visiting the town’s main square, Piazza Italia, which offer the perfect place to stop for a coffee and watch the world go by.\nJumping back on your bikes, you’ll pedal towards the Sicilian coast, riding past agricultural plots and scattered houses as you head to your destination for the evening; Pozzallo. Once on the coast, you’ll ride past long sandy beaches and the picturesque fishing hamlet of Sampieri (another Montalbano filming location). Your destination for the day, Pozzallo, is a town that’s famed for its clean beaches and crystal-clear water, offering the perfect end to a day of cycling.\n- Meals: Breakfast\n- Ascent: 250 Metres Approx.\nYour ride this morning will see you enjoying the Mediterranean coastal road to Capo Passero. The road will take you past vibrant waters and sandy beaches. As sections lead you inland, the riding will take you past marshland and lagoons, with a wide variety of bird life, such as herons, flamingos and storks. As you get closer to Capo Passero, the route will take you along tomato farm land, (now you know where your delicious sun ripened Sicilian tomatoes come from!)\nReaching the most southern point, facing the Isola delle Correnti, is going to be the highlight of the day. This is where the two seas, Ionian and Tyrrhenian meet, hence the name, island of currents.\nNestled between the turquoise waters of the Ionian Sea and the Mediterranean, the island is considered to have one of the most beautiful beaches in Sicily, as well as an impressive lighthouse. Cycling further along the coastal route, scattered with rustic Sicilian houses, you’ll ride through Portopalo di Capo Passero. Following the coast northwards, you’ll reach the quaint Marzamemi fishing hamlet with its colourful fishing boats moored up near the old fishermen’s houses. Marzamemi has an ancient tradition of Tuna fishing, still alive, and it’s here that you can taste some delicious products from the sea, such as Tuna Roe, smoked swordfish and marinated anchovies.\n- Meals: Breakfast\n- Ascent: 310 Metres Approx.\nLeaving Marzamemi, you’ll ride past the untouched Vendicari Natural Oasis, an area of great historical and scientific interest, that’s bursting with flora and fauna. Leaving your bikes secured at the park entrance, you’ll discover the reserve on foot, walking past lagoons filled with bird life.\nLeaving Vendicari, the riding picks up a little as you head for the characterful hill-top town of Noto, universally recognised as the Baroque capital city. Noto was completely rebuilt in the 17th Century, following an earthquake, taking on a whole new facade. Noto is a heady mix of opulent palaces and churches, juxtaposed with cosy courtyards. You’ll have the opportunity to explore this gorgeous town this evening, strolling down Corso Vittorio Emanuele with its imposing Cathedral, meandering the back streets lined with little restaurants and Pasticcerie. Enjoy indulging in some Sicilian specialties!\n- Meals: Breakfast\n- Ascent: 150 or 600 Metres Approx.\nLeaving Noto behind, you’ll begin your final day’s riding heading towards the coast through the wine region of Nero d‘Avola. The first section of the route will take you along quiet roads through cultivated orange groves and olive trees with the smells of Sicilian produce filling your senses.\nIn Avola you’ll be back on the coast, (how early is too early for a local wine tasting?)\nMoving on, keeping the coast on your left, you’ll ride through scattered summer-holiday residences alternating with sections of rocky coastline and cultivated fertile fields. After reaching Capo Murro at the far end of a promontory, you’ll loop back, with views opening up to the imposing Siracusa and Ortigia coastal town across the bay.\nYou’ll soon arrive at your final stop, Siracusa, the capital of Magna Grecia. Leaving your bikes at your accommodation, you can discover Siracusa’s centre; Ortigia where you can lose yourself in the winding, narrow streets as you dip in and out of craft shops. There’s also a good selection of bars and restaurants, offering the perfect opportunity to enjoy some tasty local fayre!\n- Meals: Breakfast\nToday you’ll be free to explore Siracusa at your leisure. It’s a city that has something for everyone, with lush citrus orchards, dazzling blue sea, classic Italian coffee shops and ancient Greek ruins! We recommend discovering the city’s rich past, which began when Corinthian colonists arrived in Sicily in 734 BC.\nMust-see sights include the ruins of the Temple of Apollo, the Duomo (built on what was the Greek temple to Athena), and the Fountain of Arethusa. If you fancy a spot of shopping, you can head to the traditional Ortigia Market, held every morning (excl.Sunday) where you can sample delicious Sicilian citrus fruits, limoncello and fresh fish.\nThe tour alternates between countryside and coastal views. You’ll be riding primarily on well-paved roads, except for a few short sections of dirt road. You’ll initially be riding in the Hybleaen mountains, with a bias of gentle downwards cycling through beautiful valleys, except for short sections leading to towns or to visit monuments.\nOnce on the coast you will be riding in a region which combines long flat stretches with very gentle hills, passing promontories, lagoons, tomato farms and orange groves. Coastal roads will overlook long stretches of sandy beaches and remote coves, as well as riding through stretches of towns and coastal villages.\nThe roads generally have little traffic, except for short sections of the route where you’ll ride on main roads to link up minor routes, and when entering and exiting bigger towns.\nWe recommend a hybrid bike for this tour.\nYou may notice more rubbish / litter than in other regions in Italy. This unfortunately is a governmental, political issue and the tourism sector are working with the government to find a solution to get this tidied up. That being said, you may find some sections of the route are littered a little more than others.\nLeisure Cycling Grade\nDistances generally between 15-30 miles / 24-48 kms per day\nFor those looking for an easy-going route\nMainly on the flat\nSome undulations and the odd cheeky challenge\nOur grading guidelines have been carefully created based on our many years of cycling experience, as well as customer feedback from our trips.

I have already recommended Skedaddle to a friend."", 'Marsala wine <mar-sah-lah> is a type of fortified wine that originates from the city of Marsala, in Sicily. It’s usually fortified with a distilled spirit, such as brandy, which increases the alcohol content and shelf life of the wine.\nMarsala is often referred to as ‘the cooking wine’, thanks to its prominence in classic Italian-American dishes such as – you guessed it – chicken marsala. It is not strictly a cooking wine, however, and a glass of chilled Marsala wine makes for an excellent aperitivo or Italian dessert wine.\nFind out more about the best entry-level sweet wines in our guide!\nHow Marsala Is Made\nThe distinctive Marsala notes – almonds, liquorice, honey, dried fruits, nuts – are a result of a unique blend of local Sicilian grapes, produced in the classic Marsala style.\nTypically, it’s a blend of different white wine grapes. The usual grapes are Damaschino, Grillo and Inzolia, which are grown in Western Sicily. The grapes are crushed, fermented and then fortified with brandy.\nThe sweetness of Marsala wine, and whether or not it will be used for cooking, depends on the point at which the distilled spirit is added. Marsala wines where spirit has been added before the fermentation is complete are noticeably sweeter. This is because adding the spirit stops the alcohol from fermenting into sugar.\nOn the other hand, adding spirit towards the end, or after, the fermentation process will yield a noticeably drier wine, perfect for reduction in sauces.\nSome producers also sweeten Marsala using a type of grape must, known as mosto cotto. It’s essentially a syrup made from all the bits of the grape that don’t get used.\nThe method that producers choose to sweeten their Marsala wine is important, because it will dictate the style and color of the resulting wine. The levels of sweetness in Marsala wine range from secco (dry), to semi-secco (off-dry) and dolce (sweet). Secco Marsala will be better for cooking, and dolce great to be served as a dessert wine.\n|Sweetness: dry as a cooking-wine, sweet as a dessert wine|\n|Alcohol: 15-20% ABV|\n|Aroma: dried fruits, nuts, almonds, honey|\nMarsala Wine Alcohol Content\nLike most fortified wines, Marsala wine comes in high on the alcohol percentage level – that’s the point of fortifying, after all!\nExpect Marsala wine to contain around 15-20% ABV. Compare that to, say, the 12.5% alcohol level in a glass of Pinot Grigio, and you have a potent concoction on your hands. But even still, 15-20% is not a ridiculously high alcohol level. For that reason, you can drink Marsala wine directly!\nMarsala Colors: Red, White and Gold\nThere are three main colours of Marsala wine, each with their own distinctive features. When people talk about ‘white Marsala wine’, they are most likely referring to Oro or Amber Marsala, since these are produced with white grapes. Ruby, or ‘red’ Marsala, on the other hand, is produced with local Sicilian red grapes.\nGold is the type of Marsala you’ve probably seen at your local Italian deli. It’s the classic, made with white Sicilian grapes and typically left to age in oak barrels.\nIt is usually drier than Amber, the other type of ‘white Marsala’, which makes it a secret weapon in the kitchen. Sauces, soffrittos and cream-based dishes will all benefit from a reduction and glaze with Gold Marsala wine.\nAmber Marsala is the same as gold, but with the addition of the sweetening mosto cotto mentioned earlier. The grape must is added after the fermentation of the white grape blend, making it darker, sweeter and richer than its Golden counterpart. Best application? As a dessert wine, served slightly chilled.\nSometimes known as ‘red’ Marsala, Ruby or Rubino is made from a blend of red grapes such as the Sicilian stalwart Nero d’Avola, or Perricone from Western Sicily. The use of red grapes means that Ruby Marsala contains more tannins than the other types of Marsala.\nFor this reason, you should exercise caution when using Ruby Marsala for cooking – it will impart a more tannic flavor than the other types. This can be good for thicker sauces, but might be overpowering for lighter, reduction-based dishes.\nMarsala Wine Substitutes\nThe best option for substituting Marsala wine in cooking is a fortified wine that packs a punch but retains some sweetness. There a few good options:\nTry to figure out the relative sweetness of your substitute compared to Marsala. Drier options are generally better for cooking.\nIf you’re looking for a Marsala substitute for drinking, then you can’t go wrong with another classic Italian dessert wine! Check out our guide to choose the right one for you.\nDoes Marsala Wine Go Bad?\nMarsala wine typically lasts for half a year after opening. After that, it will degrade in taste and character. That doesn’t mean that expired Marsala wine is unsuitable for cooking. In fact, you can use it in your cooking long after the expiry date.\nThere are enough sugars to preserve Marsala wine for a really long time. Even if your Marsala does go bad, it will still be perfectly fine to cook with. The worst that can happen is that it doesn’t taste that great.\nWho knows? Using expired Marsala in your cooking might even help you to come up with a new recipe!\nThe Best Marsala Wines\n1. Pellegrino 1985 Dry Marsala Superiore Riserva\nPellegrino 1985 is a dry Amber Marsala from the Cantine Pellegrino winery in the town of Marsala itself. This mature Marsala is imbued with aromas of nutmeg, oak, nuts and cloves, and makes for a choice introduction to the finer side of Marsala wine.\n2. Targa Riserva 1840 Marsala Superiore Semisecco N.V.\nNotably high in alcohol, this Targa Riserva 1840 is an off-dry Amber Marsala that ticks all the boxes of fine Marsala whilst retaining an affordablity that is lost on other mid-2000s vintages.\n3. Cantine Pellegrino Fine Rubino-Ruby Marsala\nA fine Ruby Marsala made from Nero d’Avola grown on the western Shores of Sicily. Expect cherries and pomegranate on the palette, with a sweet, lingering aftertaste perfect for the end of a long, rustic dinner.\nMarsala Wine Food Pairings\nIf you intend to pair Marsala with food, we suggest sticking to desserts. Amber Marsala will go great with sweet Italian desserts like panacotta or tiramisu. Also consider figs, dried fruits and pastries, as these will complement the earthy flavors of the Amber Marsala blend.']"	['<urn:uuid:c3958be9-c0fd-4ea9-aa67-0b74d272823c>', '<urn:uuid:91a5b9fd-42d4-4405-b416-7a805e3b7d14>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	38	113	2955
47	what should teachers avoid saying about food during meals nutrition education children	Teachers should avoid labeling foods as good/bad/clean/junk, and instead use terms like 'everyday' and 'sometimes/treat' foods. They should also never discuss food in relation to a child's weight or size, never use food as punishment or reward, and never force children to eat.	['ACECQA’s National Education Leader, Rhonda Livingstone shares her insight into National Quality Framework topics of interest.\nMealtimes at education and care services offer many rich opportunities to promote positive outcomes for children. Positive mealtimes are not only about nutritional requirements – they can shape children’s learning, development, health and wellbeing.\nThey involve every child enjoying nutritious and culturally appropriate food and snacks in a social, responsive, pleasurable, safe and educative environment. They also demonstrate outcomes from each National Quality Standard (NQS) quality area.\nI encourage you to view your current mealtimes with a positive mealtime ‘lens’ and use these reflective questions to inspire conversations with your team.\n1. Does your physical environment promote positive mealtimes?\nThe physical environment (NQS Quality Area 3) influences quality practice and has a significant impact on mealtimes and the potential for social interaction, learning, inclusion, safety, and wellbeing. The change in mood when we eat outdoors is a perfect example of this impact.\nThe components of this physical environment are broad, including everything from table and chair arrangements and table settings to noise levels and serving utensils.\nEach service has a unique environment, and few have access to purpose-built, family-style dining areas. Food may also be brought from home to be eaten at the service. In outside-school-hours care services, food may be eaten on a bench or in a hall that requires daily transformation.\nWhatever the environment, consider these questions:\n- Mealtime location: Does it promote a sense of belonging? Does it support mealtimes being social and relaxed occasions where children have time to eat, choose and interact, or does it uphold mealtimes as a rushed routine?\n- Is the environment child-centred? Do furniture and utensils suit different ages and sizes of children? Does the space accommodate children’s developing skills and independence and the inherent ‘mess’ that can sometime come with it?\n- Inclusion: Can each child access, participate and engage in mealtimes? Does the environment reflect and respect children’s needs?\n- Table settings: Do table and chair arrangements promote social interaction and engagement between children and between educators and children? Do table settings support mealtimes as an occasion?\n- Agency: Does the environment promote children’s agency and self-help skills? E.g. setting tables; finding their place; sharing food; serving food; processing waste.\n- Connection to the broader food environment: Is there a connection between mealtime and other food environments? This connection could be physical (e.g. the dining area is next to the kitchen; garden produce is used in meals); social (e.g. the cook has a relationship with children and educators; garden produce is shared with families); or through the educational program (e.g. the kitchen, garden, mealtimes or composting are used for learning experiences).\n- Transitions: Are transitions to and from mealtime environments respectful to children and calm?\n2. Do mealtimes nurture relationships?\nSecure, respectful and reciprocal relationships are fundamental principles of the approved learning frameworks, and relationships between children and with children are integral to NQS Quality Area 5.\nConnections with others support the development of children’s identity and social and emotional competence. Research has confirmed the nature, quality and consistency of interactions between educators and children is one of the most important influences on quality education and care.\nMealtimes are intrinsically social and offer regular opportunities to have positive interactions, build secure relationships, learn from one another, provide emotional support, promote language and inspire learning.\nYou could also consider:\n- Positive interactions: Educators who consistently model positive interactions and mealtime skills will support children’s development.\n- Relationship building opportunities: Are educators able to sit with children at mealtimes or is attention focused on simultaneously serving, cleaning, supervising, setting up environments or doing paperwork? Quality interactions and relationships need quality time and attention.\n3. Do mealtimes promote holistic health?\nHealthy eating is integral to promoting children’s health (NQS Quality Area 2), with physical, social and emotional health all being nurtured by positive meals times. A healthy menu (or healthy food brought from home) provides a firm foundation for health.\nFor holistic health, the healthy menu needs to be provided safely and in a health-promoting environment that also considers social and emotional health and wellbeing. The mealtime environment, relationships and staffing are important influences.\nBeyond the firm foundation of a healthy menu, you could promote positive social and emotional health and wellbeing by:\n- Creating positive mealtimes that are social, relaxed and calm\n- Actively involving children in mealtimes\n- Never using food as a punishment or reward\n- Not discussing food in relation to a child’s weight or size\n- Not labelling foods as good/bad/clean/junk; instead, talk about ‘everyday’ and ‘sometimes/treat’ foods\n- Respecting children’s appetites and preferences and never forcing children to eat\n- Respecting children’s cultural diversity and the values and beliefs of families (NQS Quality Area 6)\n- Being respectful of children and families when food choices or food brought from home are inconsistent with food and nutrition policies\n- Ensuring the menu reflects the needs of the children and community.\n4. Are mealtimes a part of the educational program?\nPositive mealtimes offer immense opportunity for each child’s learning and development to be enhanced and extended (NQS Quality Area 1).\nMealtimes allow children to learn about:\n- their identity (I prefer certain foods.

48	handmade timepiece vs electronic clock audio capabilities	A repurposed guitar clock is purely decorative with no sound capabilities, while electronic alarm clocks offer multiple audio options including five nature sounds, FM radio functionality, and traditional alarm tones.	"['|Project by Tennessee||posted 03-26-2016 11:54 AM||389 views||0 times favorited||4 comments|\nAbout two weeks ago, a guitar repair came into my shop, a horribly broken neck on an Epiphone guitar. To make matters worse, someone had ground away a lot of the break area and glued in a dowel with the grain perpendicular to the neck grain, trying to fill some of the break. They got it back together with some sort of epoxy, sanded it all down, painted it black, polished it and sold the guitar to the guy who brought it to me at a flea market.\nObviously, after a few days, the neck had snapped again. I told him I would try to fix it, but there was not enough wood left to do the job properly. Sure enough, I could not get the remaining wood to hold, and major repairs were not worth the value of the guitar, so I gave him back his guitar no charge.\nWhile handing it to him, I asked him what he planned to do with it, and he said throw it in the garbage. I told him I would like to be his garbage can, and he could have whatever he wanted off the body if I could just keep the body. All he wanted was the strap pegs and the tuners. Good by me!\nAfter he left, I then carefully cut the top off the sides, using a speedy cut on an angle grinder. Smokes like the dickens, but cuts smooth and the plywood/veneer construction of a cheaper guitar like this does not like saw blades. Speedy discs work better, but you should have the fans on!!\nWhat I ended up with was the complete front, binding, and about 1/8” of the side, all intact. I bandsawed the neck in half, then cut more as described below.\nI then took a hand plane and planed off all the bracing inside the front until it was all level with the outside edge.\nThen I took paint grade maple, (cheapest I had in stock), and glued up a 3/4” plank that would hold the front. After glueup, and planing, I drew an outline of the front on the maple, and cut it out on the bandsaw.\nAfter sanding to make it the same size, I painted the area of the maple where the soundhole would let the back show through, and glued on the front.\nAfter gluing it on, I found center in the soundhole, and drilled the proper hole size for a clock mechanism. Then I turned it over, and using a small router, created the center square that the clock body would sit in, allowing the stem to stick through the proper distance so the hands would clear the neck.\nI sawed off the back half of the remaining set neck, so I could extract the old truss rod, then making it flat on the back, and rounding off the top. Stained that very dark and done since it faces the wall.\nI stained the maple back dark and added a simple coat of paste wax. Mounted the clock mechanism, hanging hook, and finally the numbers which are stick-on from Hobby Lobby.\nGlued the string pins back in, having to drill down a bit into the maple so they would hold. Used super glue for that. Polished it all up and added the battery and hands, set the time.\nI had maybe $10 in this, and overall, workwise, maybe two hours tops.\nI put it in my Etsy store, and four days later, somebody popped $75 plus shipping. Not bad in my book. Now looking for another broken acoustic! And to top it all off, I also cut off the beautiful mahogany back, but still have not decided what to do with it.\nThanks for looking, and copy it if you want!\n-- Paul, Tennessee, http://www.tsunamiguitars.com', 'The Philips Wake-Up Light offers a choice of five pleasant nature sounds — or for the more traditionally minded, FM radio — for your morning wake-up call, but the real star of the show is the sunlight simulation. Twenty to forty minutes before your programmed wake-up time (you set both times), the clock will slowly begin to simulate the sunrise, complete with the softest dawn reds and oranges gently brightening into sunny, yellow light.\nMost digital computers depend on an internal signal at constant frequency to synchronize processing; this is referred to as a clock signal. (A few research projects are developing CPUs based on asynchronous circuits.) Some equipment, including computers, also maintains time and date for use as required; this is referred to as time-of-day clock, and is distinct from the system clock signal, although possibly based on counting its cycles.\nThis farmhouse wall clock measures 30 in. across This farmhouse wall clock measures 30 in. across the face and features horizontal cedar wood slats a white distressed finish hand painted black Roman numerals in a Poster Condensed font and an inner accent ring with individual hour marks.

This alarm clock uses a gentle glow that simulates a sunrise, waking you gently and naturally, so you definitely won\'t want to murder it when it starts going off. Choose from five different calming sounds to pair with the gradual light for an all-around sensory experience, or just select the FM radio option (that you\'ll inevitably snooze once or twice).\n“The alarm is loud with a lower frequency melody which I like since I have high-frequency hearing loss. Guaranteed to wake anyone up when the alarm goes off which is super important to me, especially if I’m using the alarm clock to wake up to catch a flight. … When the alarm goes off, press the large snooze bar on the top to have the alarm go off again in five minutes. Pressing the snooze bar on top at anytime also lights up the numbers and bars on the clock’s face, but the hands are a bit hard to see in the dark since the hands don’t light up. When the alarm on/off switch is turned to the off position, there’s a cute voice that says ‘Good Morning!’ which brings a smile to start the day. We love this clock so much, we plan to buy more to give as gifts. We’re sure the recipients will love it as much as we do.”\nThis farmhouse wall clock measures 24 in. across This farmhouse wall clock measures 24 in. across the face and features horizontal cedar wood slats a white distressed finish hand painted black Roman numerals in a Poster Condensed font and an inner accent ring with individual hour marks.

More + Product Details Close\nIn a clock driven by a weight or a spring, the power is first transmitted by the main, or great, wheel. This engages with a pinion (a gear with a small number of teeth designed to mesh with a larger wheel), whose arbor (a turning rod to which gears are attached) is attached to the second wheel that, in its turn, engages with the next pinion, and so on, down through the train to the escapement. The gear ratios are such that one arbor, usually the second or third, rotates once an hour and can be used to carry the minute hand. A simple 12-to-1 gearing, known as the motion work, gives the necessary step-down ratio to drive the hour hand. The spring or weight is fitted with a mechanism so it can be rewound when necessary, and the arbor carrying the minute hand is provided with a simple slipping clutch that allows the hands to be set to the correct time.\nWhile some people have a type of internal clock and can wake up around the same time every day, most people need a little extra help in this department. Without an alarm clock, you could sleep through your plans for the day, whether those plans include fun activities with loved ones or getting things done around the house. You might think you can use the built-in alarm on your phone. However, it\'s too easy to grab your phone from your bedside table and turn off the alarm without really waking up and getting going for the day.\nThe Electrohome Projection Alarm Clock is the second-best selling alarm clock on Amazon, with more than 9,700 reviews. Many buyers praised the projection feature, and particularly liked the fact that the brightness of the blue LCD display can be adjusted; for some owners, the clock\'s light is just a little too intense. The ability to set one alarm time for Monday through Friday, and a separate time for the weekend was another popular feature.\nGo to bed with positive thoughts. Tell yourself, “I want to get up early because…” and then, actually do it. Sleep studies happen all the time, and they tell us what exterior activities are affecting our dreams, our nightmares, etc., and talking to yourself as you drift off to bed has been proven to work. If you’re looking forward to something in the morning, tell yourself about it, and your body will hold onto that through the night.\nGet up one minute earlier each and every day. We have biological clocks; it’s not just some weird term we use. Time doesn’t exist. I’m not going to get all existential on you and make you contemplate your place in the universe, because you already know what that is—being the version of you that gets up earlier. Your body needs time to adjust, and if you can wean into it like this, in a month, you’ll be waking up a half-hour early.\nSony always makes good products, and this little cube packs a powerful alarm in its punch. When you go for the minimalist design, you’re able to incorporate more features for less money, as well as keep the nature of the product intact: in this case, it’s supposed to wake you up, and not be too flashy. You get a backup battery just in case the power fails you during a storm, but you also get ten programmable radio station buttons.\nRise and shine, rebel. This Stormtrooper comes to you, bringing news of a peace proposal with the empire. See those bright numbers displayed brilliantly on its LCD screen? That means it\'s time to go. Adjustable arms point toward the door, beckoning for you to make haste. But before you head off to save the galaxy, you might want to turn your Lego alarm clock off first. Plus, if you\'re a Darth Vader fan, you can get this alarm clock with him, too!\nSet multiple alarms, but not on the same device. The world started relying on their smartphones to wake them up, and it simply doesn’t work. Nothing is better than a good old fashion alarm clock. Here’s the trick: any device in your home that has an alarm feature, set it. That means your stove in the other room, the microwave, your alarm clock, your smartphone, and perhaps a stereo system (if anyone’s still using those). It’s one surefire way to ensure that you’ll freak out all the way to your feet.\nIf Amazon’s alarm clock isn’t your cup of tea, however, then there’s probably another cutting-edge device for you. Light sleepers may require a little background noise throughout the evening, while deep sleepers need louder alarms to wake them in the morning. There are even alarm clocks that utilize lighting technology instead of traditional alarm functions, thus allowing for a steady, gradual sunrise in your bedroom. People are finicky about their sleeping gadgets, but, fortunately, one of these alarm clocks can probably match your lifestyle and budget. And who knows? You just might finally become a morning person.\nBut where OK to Wake! really shines (pun intended) is in its unique feature that parents love; the clock will glow green and show a cute face when it\'s an acceptable time for your little one to get out of bed. That means even very young children can learn when it\'s okay to go looking for mommy or daddy — no need to be able to actually read the time. As your child grows, you can stop using the glow feature, and simply use the device as a regular, albeit cuter than average, alarm clock.\nClockmakers developed their art in various ways. Building smaller clocks was a technical challenge, as was improving accuracy and reliability. Clocks could be impressive showpieces to demonstrate skilled craftsmanship, or less expensive, mass-produced items for domestic use. The escapement in particular was an important factor affecting the clock\'s accuracy, so many different mechanisms were tried.\nEmerson alarm clock radio features relaxing sounds that help you unwind and fall asleep faster.

Although there was an attempt to modernise clock manufacture with mass production techniques and the application of duplicating tools and machinery by the British Watch Company in 1843, it was in the United States that this system took off. In 1816, Eli Terry and some other Connecticut clockmakers developed a way of mass-producing clocks by using interchangeable parts. Aaron Lufkin Dennison started a factory in 1851 in Massachusetts that also used interchangeable parts, and by 1861 was running a successful enterprise incorporated as the Waltham Watch Company.\n“Great little dual alarm clock.

49	compare wheelchair badminton categories requirements materials impact athlete performance	In Para badminton, there are six sport classes with different requirements. WH1 and WH2 athletes compete in wheelchairs, with WH1 athletes having greater impairments affecting both lower limbs and trunk, often requiring them to hold the wheelchair while playing. SL3, SL4 (lower limb impairments), SU5 (upper limb impairments), and SS6 (short stature) compete standing. Regarding materials, wheelchair composition significantly impacts performance - steel frames are heaviest but cheapest, while aluminum and titanium frames are lighter and more efficient. Rigid frame wheelchairs are more energy efficient, using 15-20% of propulsion impulse, compared to folding wheelchairs which only use 5-8% of impulse.	"['Eligible impairment types\nImpaired muscle power\nImpaired passive range of movement\nLeg length difference\nThere are six sport classes in Para badminton. Two wheelchair classes (WH), two standing classes for lower limb impairment (SL), one standing class for upper limb impairment (SU) and one class for short stature athletes (SS). Athletes in sport class WH 1 have the greatest activity limitation. WH 1, WH 2 and SL 3 play half-court (lengthwise) in singles and full-court in doubles. SL 4, SU 5 and SS 6 play full-court in all five events, which are men’s singles, women’s singles, men’s doubles, women’s doubles and mixed doubles.\nThere are two sport classes for athletes competing in a wheelchair. These athletes have lower limb impairments which create activity limitations in their ability to play standing. WH 1 athletes have a greater impairment than WH 2 athletes.\nAthletes in this sport class generally have impairment in both lower limbs and trunk. They may also have impaired hand function, impacting their ability to maneuver the wheelchair. You will often see athletes hold their wheelchair with one hand while swinging their racquet with the other. These athletes will push or pull themselves back to a neutral wheelchair sitting position after the stroke. You might expect to see athletes with high spinal cord injuries in this sport class.\nAthletes in this sport class generally have impairment in one or both lower limbs and minimal or no impairment of the trunk. You will often see WH 2 athletes move their wheelchair much quicker than the WH 1 athletes and have less reliance on holding their wheels to maintain balance. You might expect to see athletes with loss of one or two leg(s) above knee or lower spinal cord injuries.\nThere are four sport classes for athletes who compete standing. SL athletes have impairments to their lower limbs and SU in their upper limbs; SS athletes have short stature.\nAthletes in this sport class generally have impairment in one or both lower limbs and poor walking/running balance. To minimise the impact of their impairment, they compete half-court (lengthwise). You might expect to see athletes with cerebral palsy, bilateral polio or loss of both legs below the knee.\nAthletes in this sport class have a lesser impairment compared to SL 3; they generally run faster and have better balance. These athletes play full-court. You might expect to see athletes with impairment in one or both lower limbs, unilateral polio or mild cerebral palsy.\nAthletes in this sport class have impairment in their upper limbs only. It may be a very mild impairment in the playing hand such as a missing thumb, affecting grip and therefore the power of the stroke. In the same sport class, athletes may have a more severe impairment to the non-playing arm, impacting counter balance movements, trunk rotation and the ability to serve. You might expect to see athletes with loss of an arm, or an arm without function due to nerve damage.\nAthletes in this sport class have short stature.', ""Types of Wheelchair\nOriginal Editor - Naomi O'Reilly as part of the Wheelchair Service Provision Content Development Project\nThere are a wide variety of types of wheelchair, differing by propulsion method, mechanisms of control, and technology used. Some wheelchairs are designed for general everyday use, others for single activities, or to address specific access needs. No single model or size of wheelchair can meet the needs of all users, and the diversity among users creates a need for different types of wheelchair. Those selecting wheelchairs, in consultation with the user, need to understand the physical needs of the intended user and how they intend to use the wheelchair, as well as knowledge of the reasons for different wheelchair designs.\nThe composition of the frame is a key factor in the functionality of the wheelchair. The steel being the most usual, is the heaviest but also the cheapest. A wheelchair with aluminium frame is much lighter and then much easier to propel, but also more expensive. You can also find frames made of very light materials like specific aluminium, titanium and carbon. They are commonly used in rigid frame wheelchairs and have a very high price.\nThe frame of a wheelchair can also be either rigid (fixed), or foldable. The energy efficiency for the user to propel is double in a wheelchair with a rigid frame, taking an average of 15-20% of the impulse, while a folding wheelchair only uses on average of 5 - 8% of the impulse.\nBoth rigid frame and folding wheelchairs have advantages and disadvantages. The best choice will depend on the wheelchair users lifestyle, how they transfer in and out of transport and their personal preference.\nThe folding frame types of wheelchairs consist of a folding X Style Frame. Most frames fold when the locking mechanism is released for folding and tend to include removable foot rests which allow for easy folding. Most frames are made from aluminum or titanium and are heavier than the rigid frame. As with anything with moveable parts, the folding wheelchair is not as durable as the rigid frame wheelchair. Therefore maintenance is required more frequently to keep all parts in good working order. Similarily in a folding wheelchair, part of the propulsion energy is lost in movements within its structure and all points of articulation.\nRigid FrameA rigid frame wheelchair consists of a single welded frame on which the individual sits. This can incorporate either a fixed back rest or a folding back rest where the back of the chair is able to fold down. It also incorporates wheels can be removed with a quick release mechanism to enable easy storage and transportation of the wheelchair. In most cases these frames are lightweight and are made from either aluminum or titanium, and in some cases from carbon fiber, A lightweight rigid frame wheelchair can weigh as little as 10 lbs without the wheels. The advantage of these types of wheelchairs are that they have fewer moving parts, which means they are generally stronger and last longer than the folding wheelchair. Other advantages for the rigid frame is that it is easy to handle and is somewhat lighter than one similar folding wheelchair. However, the folding wheelchair is generally more comfortable for transport and storage by occupying less space.\nJust as other sports require participants to use certain equipment and skills, wheelchair sports require a certain set of equipment and skills. There are a wide range of sports developed for wheelchair users including Archery, basketball, boccia, dancing, racing, rugby, and tennis. Whether a beginner looking to start playing a wheelchair sport, those with advanced skills, or professional athletes, there are a huge range of sports wheelchairs available depending on the sport and the level at which the user plays. The wheelchairs used for each sport have evolved to suit the specific needs of that sport and often no longer resemble their everyday cousins. They are usually non-folding (in order to increase rigidity), with a pronounced negative camber for the wheels (which provides stability and is helpful for making sharp turns), and often are made of composite, lightweight materials. Even seating position may be radically different, with racing wheelchairs generally used in a kneeling position. Sport wheelchairs are rarely suited for everyday use, and are often a 'second' chair specifically for sport use, although some users prefer the sport options for everyday. Some disabled people, for instance lower-limb amputees, may use a wheelchair for sports, but not for everyday activities.\nMotivation’s Multisports Wheelchair, has been designed for a wide range of users, from school children to adults. The affordable Multisport Wheelchair, is a fraction of the price of ‘Professional’ or 'Specialist Sport Specific' Wheelchairs and yet can compete almost at the same level and is designed to make sport accessible to people with a disability. There are two models, which suit basketball, tennis and no doubt other sports and activities.\nThe main design features of the chair are;\n- adjustable backrest, ensuring that it fits a range of sizes;\n- quick release wheels;\n- inclined / angled wheels, add to the stability of the wheelchair, especially during sporting activities;\n- adjustable back wheel, also called the caster, adding stability;\n- lightweight frame manufactured from common tubular steel;\n- highly manoeuvrable, allowing it to used successfully in sporting activities.\n- robust and strong, able to withstand the type of rough treatment, that occurs in wheelchair sports.\n- removable toe guard at the front, keeps the users feet out of harms way.\nSport Specific Wheelchair\nWheelchair basketball, played by two teams of five players, is a fast-paced game where the object is to shoot the ball into the opposing team’s basket. Each team is comprised of five players and up to seven substitutes. A game consists of four periods of ten minutes. The basic rules of wheelchair basketball are very similar to running basketball with minor adjustments to meet the needs of the game in a wheelchair. The primary piece of equipment in the game of wheelchair basketball is the wheelchair, which has evolved over time alongside the development of the sport and technology. When wheelchair basketball was first played, players just used their everyday wheelchair which were often very heavy, while today wheelchair basketball chairs are specifically developed for the sport, are constructued with aluminium or titanium making them lightweight and streamlined to allow for speed and agility with many cutting-edge, sport-enhancing design features. Basketball Wheelchairs are designed for enhanced stability and mobility and now include an additional fifth and sixth wheel anti-tip devices. The front bumper is designed so that it will not lock with or be held by the opponent. The angle of the wheel base or “camber” is optimal for each athlete to allow for stability and quick turns. Guards have lower seats and therefore greater stability for ball handling and getting down the court as quickly as possible in comparison to Centers and Forwards whose chairs have higher seats and therefore less mobility, but the height increases the player's reach for shots at the hoop and for rebounds and meets their role which is typically underneath the net.\nWheelchair racing includes both track and road races. At Paralympic level there are wheelchair racing track events in: 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, 1500m, 5000m, 10000m and relay races 4x100m and 4x400m. There is also the marathon out on the road. Track Tech Explained - Racing Wheelchairs\nWatch this video about the technology used by wheelchair paralympians\nWheelchair Rugby is a mixed team sport for male and female quadriplegic athletes. A unique sport created by athletes with a disability, it combines elements of rugby, basketball and handball. Players compete in teams of four to carry the ball across the opposing team's goal line. Contact between wheelchairs is permitted, and is in fact an integral part of the sport as players use their chairs to block and hold opponents. Wheelchair Rugby players compete in manual wheelchairs specifically designed for the sport. The rules include detailed specifications for wheelchairs to ensure safety and fairness. In international competition, all wheelchairs must meet these requirements.\nWheelchair tennis, founded in 1976 when Brad Parks, follows the same rules as running tennis, as endorsed by the International Tennis Federation, with the only exception being that the wheelchair tennis player is allowed two bounces of the ball. The 'two-bounce rule' is written into the Rules of Tennis. A Tennis wheelchair is lighter than everyday chairs to allow the athlete flexibility of movement, making the game more spectacular. The wheelchair is considered part of the player - therefore, general rules of contact apply. To keep the player stable on the chair, a positioning strap across the waist and/or thighs is used. Wheelchair tennis has improved dramatically in recent years due in large part to technological advancements.\n- Wheels should be light and rigid.\n- Radial spoking wheels are best for wheelchair tennis.\n- Some of the top players are playing in wheelchairs with two small wheels at the front and an anti tip bar at the rear.\n- Camber, or the angling of the chairs wheels, has also been introduced to the tennis wheelchair. Camber aids the wheelchair tennis player by enhancing side to side balance and stability, increasing security, and enhancing turn speed.\n- Newer chairs frames are manufactured with lightweight and more durable materials such as aluminium, and titanium.\n- Today’s tennis wheelchair can weigh anywhere between 8-15 kilograms.\n- Wheelchair tennis chairs can be either custom built or fully adjustable. Adjustable chairs are recommended, especially for beginner players.\n- Tyres are crucial for wheelchair tennis. Weight in the tyres, especially the push rim, directly relates to the power required to set that wheel in motion.\n- Lighter materials are currently being tested in the push rim as well as the spokes.\n- NHS Choices.

Ticks can transmit Lyme disease, Ehrlichiosis, and Anaplasmosis to both humans and animals, with symptoms including fever, headache, fatigue, and muscle aches. Fleas can transmit Bartonella (Cat Scratch Disease) through infected flea feces or cat scratches. While fleas cannot live on humans, they can cause itchy skin lesions. For prevention, pets should receive regular parasite control treatments, and any attached ticks should be safely removed to prevent infection. Multiple products may be needed for complete protection against both parasites.	['Parasites are a common problem for pets, and with so many different parasites to protect against, owners may wonder if parasite control is really that important. To help you decide, we will discuss the most significant parasites and how they may affect the health of your pet, or even yourself.\nWhy do I need to protect my pet against parasites?\nParasites are unpleasant for both pets and owners to deal with. However, this is just one of the many important reasons for why you should keep your pet protected against them.\n- Many parasites are distressing and uncomfortable for your pet, and they may cause signs of illness as a result of their presence. Pets may even require veterinary treatment to help them recover.\n- Certain parasites carry diseases, which can be transmitted to your pet when the parasite feeds on them. Often these diseases can affect your pet’s long-term health.\n- Some parasites can also pass disease to people that they may feed on. This can be detrimental to a person’s long-term health if appropriate treatment is not provided.\n- Some parasites are themselves zoonotic, so they can also infect people, which often results in illness.\nWhich parasites do I need to protect my pet against?\nTicks are becoming an increasing problem for our pets, especially in our area, where they are commonly found on grassed areas, woodland, and heathland. Dogs are the most likely pet to be bitten by a tick, as they can easily pick them up on their walks, but cats, other pets, and people are also at risk.\nAlthough it is possible for ticks to be found all year round, they are most active between spring and autumn. Unfed ticks will attach to your pet to feed, where they can remain for up to 12 days before dropping off. Ticks can range in size from 1mm to 1cm, so small unfed ticks can be extremely difficult to detect.\nThe greatest risk from being bitten by a tick is that, if they are infected, they are able to transmit severe disease to the animal or person that they are feeding from. Lyme disease is the most common tick transmitted disease seen in Scotland, and if left untreated, Lyme disease can cause serious chronic disease in both people and dogs. There are also increasing numbers of other tick-transmitted diseases, including Babesiosis and Ehrlichiosis infection starting to be diagnosed in the UK, so watch out as these infections are spreading northwards.\nAny ticks that you find attached to your pet need to be safely removed, so you should contact our veterinary team for advice if you are unsure of how to do this. If a tick is not correctly removed then the head may be left under the skin, which can result in an infection. The best way to protect your pet from ticks and any disease that they may carry is to ensure your pet’s parasite control treatment covers ticks, and is used at the recommended intervals.\nFleas are a common parasite that can cause problems for many of our pets including dogs, cats, and even rabbits. They are irritating and itchy, and any pet affected by fleas will commonly cause themselves painful skin injuries as a result of scratching. In young puppies and kittens, they can even suck enough blood to cause anaemia. Some pets with Flea Allergic Dermatitis are particularly sensitive to flea saliva, so if bitten they will develop a severe skin reaction. Regular preventative flea treatment is particularly important for sensitive pets to protect them from developing skin issues.\nWhile fleas cannot live on people, they can bite and cause itchy skin lesions, which are unpleasant. However, fleas can also carry the bacteria Bartonella, which can cause infection in cats and people who come into contact with infected flea faeces. This disease is often referred to as Cat Scratch Disease, as people can also contract Bartonella through a scratch from an infected cat.\nThere are a number of different mites that may affect your pet. The mites Sarcopes and Demodex are the ones most commonly known, which can go on to cause severe skin lesions in dogs, but there are other mites that cause skin issues and ear problems in cats, rabbits and other pets. Along with causing itchy and distressing skin problems, mites can also be difficult and frustrating to treat.\nCertain mites, such as Sarcoptes, can also be zoonotic and pass to humans, where they can go on to cause unpleasant skin lesions, so if you develop any unusual skin signs and are worried about mites, you should contact your doctor.\nThere are many different types of worms that can infect our pets, including the most commonly known: Roundworms and Tapeworm. Usually these worms will not cause severe disease in healthy adult pets, but they can lead to weight loss, itchy bottoms, and sometimes vomiting or diarrhoea. However, some are zoonotic and can be transmitted to people and children, where they can cause severe disease if they migrate into the liver, brain or eyeball. Regular treatment of pets helps to keep people – especially young children – safe.\nLungworm is a parasite that all dog owners should be aware of, as it can be fatal. Often, dogs infected with Lungworm will only show vague signs of illness, so owners may not be aware that their dog is infected until serious disease has developed, by which point infection may prove fatal. This means that it is important to provide your dog with preventative Lungworm treatment all year round.\nHow can I protect my pet against parasites?\nThere are a number of different parasite control products that can be used to protect your pet. However, not all parasites will be prevented by one product, meaning that often a combination of treatments are required for complete parasite protection. For many parasite treatments there is also a choice between tablets, spot-on treatments and medicated collars, so there is sure to be a product that is suitable for your pet.\nIt is also important that parasite treatments are only given to the pet that they have been prescribed for, as certain products can be fatal to some dogs, and to cats and rabbits if the wrong medication is given. If you are unsure which parasite control products are best for your pet, speak to one of our veterinary team for advice.', 'The following maps are color coded to indicate the number of reported positive cases of ehrlichiosis, Lyme disease, heartworm disease, and anaplasmosis in dogs within the Southwest Gulf Coast area. Due to how many dogs go untested for vector-borne diseases, the actual number of dogs infected by ticks is likely higher than shown in these maps. The data was sourced from over 10,000 veterinary clinics, telephone surveys, and IDEXX references laboratories results. Review the data and prevent your pets from becoming a statistic with proper vaccination through your local vet.\nEhrlichiosis / Ehrlichia\nEhrlichiosis is the general name used to describe several bacterial diseases that affect animals and humans. Human ehrlichiosisis a disease caused by at least three different ehrlichial species in the United States: Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Ehrlichia ewingii, and a third Ehrlichia species provisionally called Ehrlichia muris-like (EML). Ehrlichiae are transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tick. The lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum) is the primary vector of both Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Ehrlichia ewingii in the United States. Typical symptoms include: fever, headache, fatigue, and muscle aches. Usually, these symptoms occur within 1-2 weeks following a tick bite. Ehrlichios is diagnosed based on symptoms, clinical presentation, and later confirmed with specialized laboratory tests. The first line treatment for adults and children of all ages is doxycycline. Ehrlichiosis and other tickborne diseases can be prevented. Summary from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nLyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks. Typical symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans. If left untreated, infection can spread to joints, the heart, and the nervous system. Lyme disease is diagnosed based on symptoms, physical findings (e.g., rash), and the possibility of exposure to infected ticks. Laboratory testing is helpful if used correctly and performed with validated methods. Most cases of Lyme disease can be treated successfully with a few weeks of antibiotics. Steps to prevent Lyme disease include using insect repellent, removing ticks promptly, applying pesticides, and reducing tick habitat. The ticks that transmit Lyme disease can occasionally transmit other tickborne diseases as well. Summary from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nHeartworm is preventable, but serious and potentially fatal, parasite that primarily infects dogs, cats, and ferrets. It can also infect a variety of wild animals, including wild canids (e.g., foxes, wolves, coyotes), wild felids (e.g. tigers, lions, pumas), raccoons, opossums, and pinnipeds (e.g., sea lions and seals), as well as others. There have been documented human infections, but they are thought to be rare and do not usually result in signs of illness. Summary from AVMA.\nAnaplasmosis is a tickborne disease caused by the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum. It was previously known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) and has more recently been called human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA). Anaplasmosis is transmitted to humans by tick bites primarily from the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis) and the western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus). Of the four distinct phases in the tick life-cycle (egg, larvae, nymph, adult), nymphal and adult ticks are most frequently associated with transmission of anaplasmosis to humans. Typical symptoms include: fever, headache, chills, and muscle aches. Usually, these symptoms occur within 1-2 weeks of a tick bite. Anaplasmosis is initially diagnosed based on symptoms and clinical presentation, and later confirmed by the use of specialized laboratory tests. The first line treatment for adults and children of all ages is doxycycline. Anaplasmosis and other tickborne diseases can be prevented.

51	what are modern slavery types enforcement measures	Modern slavery encompasses several types of exploitation: sexual exploitation of adults, trafficking of adults for labor exploitation, trafficking of adults for criminal exploitation, trafficking of minors for sexual/criminal/labor exploitation, and other forms of exploitation. To enforce against these, businesses are required by law (like the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015) to publish annual statements detailing their anti-slavery measures if they have a global turnover above £36 million. Companies implement various enforcement measures including supplier screening, risk assessments, confidential reporting hotlines, employee training programs, and immediate termination of business relationships with entities found involved in slavery or trafficking.	"[""Modern Slavery Statement\nPer the (UK) Modern Slavery Act 2015 all bodies corporate and partnerships who (irrespective of where they are incorporated) (1) carry on a business, or part of a business, in the UK supplying goods or services, and (2) have a consolidated global turnover of above £36 million (or Euro equivalent) per annum, are required to prepare and publish an annual “Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement”.1\nThis statement must set out the measures an organisation has taken during its financial year to ensure that slavery or human trafficking is not taking place in any of its supply chains or within itself.1\nThe Republic of Ireland has similar legislation, primarily the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, as amended by the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) (Amendment) Act 2013.2\nModern slavery is an international crime affecting an estimated 40.3 million individuals3 around the world. This global issue transcends age, gender and ethnicities; it is estimated that 1 in 4 victims of modern slavery are children and that 3 quarters are women and girls4.\n“Modern slavery” refers to the offences of human trafficking, slavery, servitude, and forced or compulsory labour. This can then be considered under five headings:\nthe sexual exploitation of adults;\nthe trafficking of adults into conditions of labour exploitation;\nthe trafficking of adults into conditions of criminal exploitation;\nthe trafficking of minors into conditions of sexual, criminal or labour exploitation;\nother forms of exploitation.5\n“Human trafficking” is a global crime that trades in people and exploits them for profit.. “Human trafficking” is defined in the UN Trafficking in Persons Protocol, which supplements the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, as “the recruitment, transport, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a person by such means as threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud or deception for the purpose of exploitation”. Although human trafficking often involves an international cross-border element, it is also possible to be a victim of modern slavery within your own country. There are several broad categories of exploitation linked to human trafficking, including sexual exploitation, forced labour, domestic servitude, organ harvesting, child related crimes, forced marriage and illegal adoption.6\nModern slavery includes victims who have been brought from overseas and vulnerable people in the UK and in Ireland who are forced to work illegally against their will across many different sectors such as agriculture, hospitality (catering, etc.), construction, car wash services, retail and manufacturing.5\nEstimates of the number of victims of modern slavery in the UK and Republic of Ireland have markedly increased in recent years. The 2018 Global Slavery Index3 estimated approx. 136,000 such individuals in the UK, with approx. 8,000 in the Republic of Ireland. The UK National Crime Agency (NCA) annual National Strategic Assessments of Serious and Organised Crime indicate significantly increasing numbers of modern slavery related cases referred through relevant reporting/referral mechanisms, and numbers of associated police investigations, each year.5\nIt has been estimated that globally modern slavery generates as much as $150bn (£116bn) in profits every year with more than a third of these profits generated in developed countries, including the UK and the Republic of Ireland.7\nThe (UK) National Crime Agency (NCA) identified in their Indicators of Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking in the Accountancy Sector8 guidance what they consider the key areas where they deems there to be greater risk and visibility of modern slavery and human trafficking. This NCA guidance is included as an Appendix in the Grant Thornton Ireland (Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland) Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy so to assist staff (both operating in a Republic of Ireland or a UK Northern Ireland context) better identify potential real-world risks or actual instances in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking. That NCA guidance has also been considered and has influenced the content of this statement and of the policy, as well as communications and training relating to this topic.\nWe are a small, privately owned limited company with offices in Dublin.\nWe employ a team of three and work with a small group of trusted partners and advisors based in Ireland and the UK.\nThe policy of Inspiring Change is to conduct all of our business in an honest and ethical manner, and to comply with all applicable legislation. We strive to ensure that neither modern slavery nor human trafficking supports our supply chain or our businesses; this objective is implicit in our policies and procedures. We aim for a zero-tolerance approach to violations of anti-slavery and human trafficking laws.\nIf breaches of these laws are found within our supply chain, we will look to support organisations in their efforts to comply with the applicable legislation. We’ll immediately terminate business with individuals and organisations found to be involved in slavery, human trafficking, forced or child labour.\nWe are committed to acting professionally and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships whether in Ireland, UK or abroad.\nReporting knowledge or suspicion of slavery or human trafficking\nIt’s incumbent on everyone who works with or for Inspiring Change to immediately report knowledge or suspicion of slavery or human trafficking. Any genuine suspicion or knowledge of slavery or human trafficking is to be immediately reported to Managing Director who will decide what further action, if any, is deemed necessary.\nEmployees or partners who raise concerns of slavery or human trafficking in good faith may do so without fear of discrimination or reprisal.\nWe don't and won’t work with organisations or clients who we believe to be in contravention of the Modern Slavery Act.\nWe include appropriate anti-slavery and human trafficking provisions into our Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland terms of business with clients.\nGrant Thornton has procedures in place pertaining to our employment practices.\nRobust recruitment processes in line with Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland (UK) employment law (as applicable), including “right to work” document checks, contracts of employment, and checks to ensure all employees are above minimum working age (16).\nMarket-related pay and reward, which is reviewed annually and linked to professional services firms benchmarks.\nSupply chain/ Procurement\nWe recognise that we’re exposed to a greater slavery and human trafficking risk when dealing with suppliers of products and services, particularly those who have operations and suppliers in other territories. However, we consider that we, and the majority of our suppliers, are not in industries with a high risk of modern day slavery. In addition, our supply chains are primarily confined to Ireland and the UK, countries with a relatively lower risk of modern day slavery and human trafficking.\nWe continue to consider on an ongoing basis ways to further enhance awareness on the issues of slavery and human trafficking and of Grant Thornton’s Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy among relevant employees and partners.\nWe will continue to develop and implement the measures mentioned above in respect of our supply chain.\nOur approach to modern slavery and human trafficking risk will continue to evolve and we will continue to mitigate these risks through the provisions mentioned above during 2021 and beyond.\nInspiring Change and our people will take responsibility for this statement and its objectives, and we’ll review and update it as appropriate.\nInspiring Change Ltd\n1.

More than 73,000 aircraft rely on Meggitt’s critical technologies, sub-systems and components. Our global operations are focused on providing high performance solutions, adapted to meet unique customer requirements. Our product portfolio includes thermal solutions; wheel and brake systems; fire detection, protection and control; aircraft safety and security equipment; advanced polymers and composites, including radomes and seals; avionics; and sensing and condition monitoring systems. Innovation is at the heart of everything we do. Operating through four divisions: Airframe Systems; Engine Systems; Energy & Equipment; and Services & Support, we employ over 9,000 people across over 40 manufacturing facilities and sales offices in Europe, North America and Asia.\nOur supply chain and 70% of our direct material spend can be broadly categorised into 11 sectors as follows: machining, printed circuit boards, fasteners, consumables, electric components, electric assemblies, cable/wire, metal fabrications, castings, forgings and raw materials.\nTo help manage our supply chain, we have over 275 dedicated employees in our procurement team across the Group that are aligned to support our sites. We also have a central indirect procurement team for services that fall outside manufacturing. Due to the industries within which we operate, our overall business effectiveness relies on our relationships with our external supply base.\nWe expect our suppliers, their employees and their supply chains to operate in a way that supports our commitment to strong ethical standards.\nModern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights. It takes various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour, child labour and human trafficking and corresponding recruiting or housing practices, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person’s liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain.\nMeggitt has a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery. We are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our business or our supply chain.\nWe seek to ensure transparency in our own business and in our approach to tackling modern slavery throughout our supply chain, consistent with our obligations under the UK’s Modern Slavery Act 2015 as well as aligned United States Government’s policy and contract obligations prohibiting trafficking in persons and other relevant regulations. We expect the same high standards from all of our contractors, suppliers and other business partners.\nWe have considered the risk of modern slavery taking place in the Company’s business during the year. Taking into account:\nwe consider the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking occurring within the Company’s operations to be low and the arrangements described below to be proportionate and effective.\nWe have also considered the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain. Taking into account:\nwe consider the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking occurring within the Company’s supply chain to be moderately low and the arrangements described below to be proportionate and effective.\nThe statement below contains a summary of our internal policies and processes as well as the mechanisms we use to manage risk in our supply chain.\nIntegrity is one of our three Meggitt values and we are committed to achieving the highest standards of ethical conduct in our business. We also expect the same commitment from our suppliers and others working on our behalf. Our Policies reflect this commitment.\nThe Meggitt Code of Conduct applies to our entire workforce, whatever their job and wherever they are located. The Code sets out our commitment to:\nand is clear that non-compliance with requirements of the Code could result in disciplinary action, including probation, suspension and termination of employment and legal action.\nAction since 1 January 2020\nSteps taken during the year to strengthen our policies include refreshing the Code of Conduct to clarify our values and expectations, including those relating to human rights and modern slavery, and relaunching our independent ethics line as the “Speak Up” line which enables our employees to report concerns 24-7.\nThe Code of Conduct is supported by a number of other policies that clarify the behaviour expected by Group employees and set out minimum standards to be applied throughout the Group.\nOur Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability Policy documents our values relating to the management of social, ethical and environmental matters and sets out our commitment to:\nOur Ethics and Business Conduct Policy states our commitment to integrity, honesty, and respect for others in all our business relationships. The highest standard of ethical behaviour is expected from employees, directors and from those who act on the Group’s behalf in the performance of their professional responsibilities and in their own personal conduct.\nThe following processes are in place throughout our organisation to embed our values and ensure compliance with our policies:\nThe Group operates and encourages the use of a confidential and anonymous whistleblowing hotline. The hotline is operated by an independent external service provider, which allows employees to speak in confidence to someone who is neither an employee nor their line manager. The external provider reports all disclosures to the Group Director of Ethics and Corporate Responsibility, who is responsible for ensuring that calls are investigated independently from the Company’s management. The hotline is a free-phone telephone number, which is widely publicised at Meggitt sites, in the Code of Conduct and the Group’s intranet.\nEmployees are actively encouraged to report any behaviour inconsistent with the Code of Conduct or any Group Policies, including any actual or suspected incidents of modern slavery, via the Speak up hotline.\nThroughout the year the Company received no reported concerns regarding modern slavery in its operations. If such an issue was reported, the Company would immediately undertake a thorough investigation of the issue complained of and where substantiated, the Company would put in place robust action plans to eliminate the issue and protect any victims.\nAction since 1 January 2020\nDuring the year the Whistleblowing hotline was re-branded as ‘Speak Up’ and relaunched across the Group. In January 2021, around 50 individuals representing various functions attended a training session to conduct independent investigations to ensure that the Group has appropriate resources to investigate all claims thoroughly.\nWe obtain annual confirmations from the business units and divisions with regard to compliance with Group Policies and processes. This was extended in January 2021 to seek the same confirmations from our Product Groups.\nThrough this process, all of our business units, product groups and divisions have confirmed:\nWe have a comprehensive Ethics Programme led by the Group Director of Ethics and Corporate Responsibility. This includes:\nWe have HR and operational processes which reduce the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking. Our HR function is responsible for all recruitment activities and in doing so follows standard recruitment procedures. We use reputable employment agencies and temporary labour agencies in sourcing labour and conduct appropriate due diligence on any new agency we engage. Our U.S. agreements with employment agencies include obligations to comply with modern slavery and human trafficking prohibitions.\nAs customers we play an active role in supplier development and have adopted various means to clearly communicate our expectations to our suppliers and monitor their compliance with them. We recognise that we cannot eliminate all risk of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain and our primary focus is on maintaining good working relationships with our suppliers to ensure we have open lines of communication especially where we have key dependencies. To this end we have embarked upon a long-term strategy of rationalising our supply base, recognising fewer suppliers with a ‘preferred/recommended’ status enabling us to drive to new levels of engagement and partnership. Our aim is to focus our energies and time on developing relationships with our suppliers to ensure they meet our standards on quality, delivery and compliance.\nAction since 1 January 2020\nDuring the year we reduced our direct supplier count by 858 suppliers and continued actions to develop relationships with existing suppliers\nWe manage risk in our supply chain in the following ways:\nOur suppliers are required to agree to our standard purchasing conditions and comply with our policies on slavery, human trafficking, forced labour and child labour or agree to terms and policies that are similar to ensure that their principles and practices are aligned with our expectations and standards.\nSupplier oversight during 2020 was maintained by a combination of planned quality audits on key suppliers and wider engagement by our supplier development engineers, either through direct visits where possible or via remote engagement where restrictions applied. While these visits and engagement activities did not include a formal audit of the labour and welfare conditions of the suppliers’ workforce, they provided visual oversight of our suppliers’ employees and their work environments, providing assurance that our direct suppliers respect human rights and do not use child or forced labour.\nAccount Reviews are held at site level with key suppliers to maintain high levels of engagement, providing an opportunity for both parties to share important updates, discuss key issues, review performance metrics and agree improvement actions. To compliment this, we also hold Quarterly Business Reviews at a commodity level, with our key strategic suppliers, which are more focussed on group level performance (for suppliers supporting multiple sites) and provide an opportunity to share updates and review progress towards longer term strategic objectives.\nThe Group screens new suppliers as part of the onboarding process. As part of this screening, suppliers are required to demonstrate compliance to industrywide acknowledged policies, including those relating to human rights and modern slavery.\nWe conduct a risk assessment each year to identify our higher risk suppliers based on spend and geographical location. Members of our procurement team engage with those identified as higher risk and seek additional assurance.\nAction since 1 January 2020\nDuring 2020 we strengthened our modern slavery risk assessment of our suppliers by extending our definition of ‘higher risk’ supplier to include those located in the top 100 countries in terms of prevalence of modern slavery (in prior years we limited the definition of higher risk supplier to those in the top 50 countries in terms of prevalence). This assessment identified 24 higher risk suppliers. The products supplied by these 24 higher risk suppliers were then cross referenced against the list of products by source country identified by the Global Slavery Index as at risk of forced labour. This identified 1 higher risk supplier providing products considered to be at risk of modern slavery.\nDuring Q1 2021 Group procurement will engage with these 24 higher risk suppliers, in particular the supplier providing the product considered to be at risk of modern slavery, to ensure that they understand our zero tolerance approach to modern slavery and human trafficking and comply with our expectations in respect of labour and welfare conditions.\nWe understand the correlation between poor payment practices and modern slavery and remain committed to maintaining fair working relationships with our suppliers at all times. The factors that determine our current payment periods are our standard terms and conditions or the individual agreements that we make with suppliers. Our payment terms are consistent with terms and conditions prevalent across the global aerospace industry. We also offer financing arrangements to our suppliers. We report on payment practices in the UK as required, and a further statement on UK payment practices is disclosed on our website.\nCompliance with our Code of Conduct and Group Policies is monitored by the Corporate Responsibility Committee to ensure that they remain effective. The Committee also reviews supplier engagement practices and this statement on modern slavery.\nThe Corporate Responsibility Committee:\nThe Committee reports to the Board on its activities. No matters of concern were identified by the Corporate Responsibility Committee in 2020.\nThis statement is for Meggitt PLC (0432989) and its subsidiary companies Meggitt (UK) Limited (00629814) and Meggitt Aerospace Limited (03477890) for the financial year ended 31 December 2020.

52	what significant changes russia territory control leadership putin stalin	"Russia has experienced significant changes in territorial control under different leaders. Under Stalin (1924-1953), the USSR maintained strict control through forced collectivization, mass deportations of North Caucasus and Crimean peoples (1943-1944), and political repression. In the modern era, Putin has intensified centralized control, particularly since 2012. He modified the constitution to extend his potential presidency until 2034 and changed its opening from ""We, the multinational people of the Russian Federation"" to ""We Russians, in union with other multinational peoples,"" establishing Russian primacy. This change faced strong protests in regions like Tatarstan but was forcefully implemented. Putin's administration actively suppresses attempts by regions to protect their languages and cultures, labeling such efforts as separatism."	"['Nätmagasinet Mänsklig säkerhet (MS) kan här publicera en artikel om hur Ryssland inte kan demokratiseras innan landet upphör att kolonisera och tvångsförryska människor av olika etniciteter både öster och väster om Uralbergen.\nTexten är ursprungligen tryckt i tidskriften ”New Eastern Europe”, nr 6 2022 och författad av Milosz J. Cordes, tidigare polsk diplomat med posteringar i bl a Bryssel (EU) och Moskva.\nMed denna text inleder MS nu ett samarbete ”New Eastern Europe” där vi planerar att utbyta texter så att det vi publicerar kan publiceras av NEE och vi kan ge utrymme åt deras texter. Vi ser mycket fram emot detta som infriar en ambition vi haft att utverka samarbete med länder i östra Europa som gränsar till Ukraina.\nFör er som vill läsa mer om Ryssland som kolonialmakt rekommenderas också Lena Jonsons ”Volga och inre Ryssland: en resa i tid och rum (Dialogos, 2023). Jonson fokuserar på de områden Ryssland koloniserat väster om Ural medan Cordes lägger tonvikten på koloniseringen österut. Men samma förryskningspolitik beskrivs, och hur den hårdnat under Putin, särskilt sedan 2012. Den nya konstitution Putin drev igenom som gav honom möjlighet att inneha presidentämbetet till 2034 inleds nu med ”Vi ryssar, i förbund med andra mångnationella folk” vilket ersatte ”Vi, Ryska Federationens mångnationella folk”. Detta sätt att slå fast ryskt primat väckte starka protester i bl a Tatarstan men förslaget drevs hårdfört igenom. Jonson skriver också om hur alla försök att skydda regionernas egna språk och kultur brutalt slås ner och definieras som separatism.\nAtt Ryssland som kolonialmakt kunnat gå under radarn så länge är ett mysterium! Särskilt nu när Ryssland försöker sälja in sig globalt som de afrikanska och andra koloniserade folkens bästa vänner.\nVi vill gärna återkomma till detta ämne och välkomnar texter och tankar i frågan.\nGerd Johnsson-Latham, Chefredaktör.\nWhy Russia needs decolonisation for its future democratization (part I of II)\nA: Miłosz J. Cordes\nIntro: The war in Ukraine has been possible because for centuries Russian and Soviet authorities have focused their ideological and political attention on the European part of Russia. In doing so, they have been ignoring the interests of other regions of the country, as well as its non-Slavic population. In this sense, 75 percent of Russia’s territory acts as Moscow’s internal colonial empire. Not only is it financing the war with its oil and gas, but also providing cannon fodder for Russian military commanders who do not value the lives of Buryats, Tatars of Chechens as much as those of Slavic citizens. Decolonization is thus essential to ensure democratization of Russia.\nRussia has for centuries colonised the East\nThe year 1582 the Cossack ataman Yermak embarked on what was a private enterprise of a merchant family. The Stroganov family was looking for ways to secure their trade routes in the East, repeatedly plundered by Siberian warlords. Although Yermak died in an ambush shortly thereafter, he paved the road to another expedition, this time commissioned by the tsar.\nMoscow rulers expanded rapidly to the east. Their reign reached north-western shores of Pacific Ocean in less than 200 years. From a small duchy on the outskirts of Rus, Moscow transformed into the Russian Empire, stretching from the Baltic Sea all the way to Korea and the Japanese Islands. Yermak could not know that his expedition would lead to the birth of a new colonial power. Unlike its Western European counterparts, however, its colonies were officially part of the metropolis.\nBecause of that Russia has only been subject to partial decolonisation. It lost its external territories, but it has kept its internal colonies. This phenomenon is blatantly visible in Putin’s actions in Ukraine where he is trying to regain what he considers essential for the wellbeing of the metropolis with the use of material and human resources provided by peripheral territories.\nIn so doing, Putin acts on behalf of merely 25 percent of the country’s total area at the expense of the remaining 75 percent lying east of the Urals, similar to how many European powers in the 19th and 20th centuries treated their dependencies in Africa, America or Asia. It means that an area 30 percent larger than the United States or 65 times than the United Kingdom has been exploited in an almost openly colonial way 60 years after the peak of decolonisation.\nThere are two reasons explaining this phenomenon. The first one relates to narratives on history and politics of memory pursued by the Kremlin at least since 2012, but is in fact deeply rooted in the Russian imperial rhetoric. The second is the ethnic composition of Russian armed forces in Ukraine, especially in the face of the “partial” mobilisation, and the losses non-ethnic Russian soldiers have been suffering.\nWhen Vladimir Putin announced his come-back as president he published a series of programme articles, setting the stage for his new-old role. More specifically, he described Russia (just like former Tsars) as a distinct civilisational entity based on the legacy of medieval Rus, the Orthodoxy and traditional values that Russians have supposedly kept over centuries.\nPutin’s articles partly explain the way the Russian president perceives the spatial dimension of fundaments of Russia. Her roots are limited to Eastern Europe and to the three Eastern European entities Putin sees as three branches of one Russian nation (triyediniy russkiy narod): Russians, Belarusians and Ukrainians. They are the backbone of today’s Russia, Putin argues, stemming from the alleged unity of medieval Rus with the dominating role of Moscow.\nIt partly explains Putin’s fixation on Ukraine, as Kyiv was the place where the first Ruthenian Orthodox metropolis was erected. To him, controlling Ukraine is essential to secure the core of the Russian civilisation. He confirmed and refined this point of view in July 2021 when he in another article tried to convince the readers that Ukraine is part of Russia.\nBy pursuing such narrative, Putin seeks to downplay the role of other political entities on this vast area, such as the proto-democratic merchant Novgorod Republic or the nobleman Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Russian president completely ignores the role of other Slavic nations in the development of Russia’s power. Although they populated the majority of Russia-controlled territories ever since its rapid expansion eastwards in late 16th century, they have never become an equal part of the official Russian narrative of history. Children in Khabarovsk and Vladivostok are taught about developments in culture and politics that took place several thousand kilometres away, obliged to treat them as their own story.\nAs a result, today’s Russia remains the world’s only colonial empire that exploits its own citizens. It has never been decolonised which also partly answer the question we have been asking ourselves since 1991: how can Russia ever become a full-fledged democracy?\nRussia’s colonies constitute an integral part of the country’s territory, much like Algeria was part of France. The difference is, however, that large parts of northern Eurasia east of the Urals that Russia took control of have always been scarcely inhabited and deprived of strong political entities. It was relatively easy for Moscow and St. Petersburg to exert control over lands lacking highly organised power-structures in spite of their distinctive, objectivised culture and awareness of non-Russian past.\nRussia created the bulk of its colonial dominium within its own territory by direct incorporation and over the centuries applied different methods of economic exploitation, as well as political and cultural violence. It is important to mention that I am not talking about the peoples living on the southern borders of Russia in the Caucasus and Central Asia. Their political traditions and established cultural heritage have frequently made them struggle against Russian domination.\nThe different possibilities to break free from Russia is also visible by looking at what was going on in the western part of the empire after the First and Second World War. Russia and the Soviet Union first gained and then lost control of areas populated by people sharing a strong sense of national identity, often backed by tradition of statehood, protection of their own languages; Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians or Ukrainians. Thus, with their language, culture and elites they managed to survive Russian domination and regain political sovereignty when the moment was right – in 1917/1918 and in 1989/1991.\nThey were not Russia’s dominions, but rather provinces in the ancient Roman sense of the word.\nMiłosz J.

53	How does the ALICE protocol protect students during armed threats?	ALICE is a federally endorsed safety protocol that stands for Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, and Evacuate. Instead of relying on centralized instructions, it encourages staff and students to respond based on their situation. They can choose to lockdown and barricade rooms, evacuate the building if safe, alert others about the threat, pass information to First Responders, and as a last resort, counter the intruder rather than being passive victims.	"[""Safety & Security in D118\nAs Director of Safety & Security, Mr. Burke is responsible for the following key areas:\nReviewing and implementing changes to school safety protocols;\nOperationalizing the district’s comprehensive safety assessment;\nProviding security and safety services for all school campuses and buildings;\nCollaborating with buildings to engage students in appropriate behaviors and activities to facilitate academic and social-emotional growth.\nMission & Vision\nSchool Safety Vision:\nA safe school is a place where learning can occur in a welcoming environment free of intimidation, violence, and fear. Wauconda CUSD 118 is dedicated to providing a safe environment for children so they can focus on learning and growing.\nSchool Safety Mission:\nThe Wauconda CUSD 118 Safety and Security Department is committed to the safety and security of students, staff, and visitors within all Wauconda CUSD 118 facilities. Professional development and collaborative partnerships are necessary to the success of the safety plan and emergency management efforts that include prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery procedures relevant to potential natural and human-caused crises.\nSafe School Planning\nSafe school planning is a partnership that includes a working relationship with local emergency responders, community members, government leaders, social service networks, parents, and students.\nA safe school plan is a dynamic process that is comprehensive, evaluative and constantly evolving.\nSafe school planning is as much of a journey as it is a destination.\nOrganizational capacity, professional development, and teamwork are formed and shaped during the journey.\nWauconda CUSD 118 has been through a comprehensive school security assessment where our schools and district safety plans were assessed to identify the positive school safety procedures currently practiced, and to make recommendations for strengthening the district's safety, security, and crisis preparedness. We continue to practice, evaluate, and update our plans on a regular basis.\nEmergency Alert Notifications\nWauconda Community United School District 118 communicates regularly with parents using a mass electronic messaging system. Parents will receive automated phone calls, text messages, and emails during school emergencies. If families are not receiving messages, check to ensure that the correct phone and email address are on file. It is critical that the District has correct contact information for families during an emergency; please make sure to update any school emergency contact information for each child each time the information changes.\nPlease do not attempt to call the school during an emergency, the District will contact families with the information as soon as possible. Although there are people assigned to answer phones at school, these lines are likely to be overloaded during an emergency and are not the best source of information. Keep your phone with you during emergencies to receive updates.\nFor school emergency information, check the district website and watch for communications from the district to your phone or email.\nDepending on the emergency, families may not be able to get close to the school and may be asked to wait in a safe area. If it is hazardous for students to be released, everyone will be kept inside the school until notified by the authorities that it is safe outside. Schools will act with the safety of students in mind, and school officials will always follow the directives of the police department and the fire department.\nALICE School Safety Protocols\nAll Wauconda School District teachers and staff use ALICE as part of their school safety protocols.The safety protocol called ALICE was implemented in the unlikely event of an armed intruder in one of our school buildings. This training encourages staff and students to respond based on their situation, rather than rely on centralized instructions in dynamic times of crisis.\nALICE is a federally endorsed safety protocol. The letters ALICE stand for Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter and Evacuate:\nAlert – inform people of the threat, giving as much information as possible.\nLockdown – Students and Staff can choose to lockdown and barricade the room that they are in if they determine that it is not safe to evacuate.\nInform – pass on as much information as possible to others and to First Responders, including contacting 911.\nCounter – an effort of last resort, if an armed intruder is able to get into the space that they are in; students are being trained to use every effort to stop the intruder instead of being passive victims.\nEvacuate – If it is safe to do so, all are encouraged to evacuate the building, and remove themselves from the threat.\nLearn more about ALICE here -- ALICE Training Institute\nUnder ALICE training, staff and students are oriented to different options to respond to a school intruder who is intent on doing harm. In certain circumstances, the “lock the door and hide” strategy might be appropriate. In some cases, the teacher and students might take precautions to barricade the entrance(s) of the classroom. Under certain conditions, it might be the best decision for the teacher and students to flee the building. It is the intention of ALICE that the strategies we provide will increase the chances that our staff and students might survive if a terrible circumstance of an armed intruder ever were to occur.\nStudent & Parent Reunification\nThe Wauconda School District follows the Standard Reunification Method (SRM). Circumstances may occur at the school that require parents to pick up their students in a formalized, controlled release or dismissal from a location other than their child's school. This process is called Reunification and may be necessary due to weather, a power outage, hazardous materials or if a crisis occurs at the school. The Reunification method is a protocol that makes the process more predictable and less chaotic/confusing for all involved.\nReunifying students with their parents or legal guardians in the aftermath of an emergency is very important and requires planning in advance of the emergency to ensure everyone is safe. Accomplishing this goal requires the efficient, coordinated use of resources and efforts from across the entire community (including School District personnel, local law enforcement, fire and Emergency Management officials).\nWHAT CAN I DO BEFORE THIS HAPPENS TO PREPARE?\nParents should always make sure to keep their emergency contact information up to date in the school so notifications will be made to you in a timely manner. ALWAYS bring your identification when you will be picking up your student(s).\nParents may be notified in a number of ways. The school may send out automated phone messages, emails or website postings – usually multiple messages to keep you updated to this event. ALWAYS BRING YOUR ID. Also make sure that your personal information such as phone numbers and email addresses are up to date so you will receive these messages. Please do not call the school.\nIf a parent or guardian is notified that a reunification is needed, there are some expectations that parents or guardians should be aware of. Do not go to the school - students will not be released from the school. Do not call the school - the staff will be involved with transporting students. Always bring identification to the reunification site. Reunification is a process that protects both the safety of the student and provides an accountable change of custody from the school to a recognized custodial parent or guardian. We cannot release students to anyone who is not listed on the Emergency Contact information for the school.\nWHAT IF THE PARENT CANNOT PICK UP THEIR STUDENT?\nWhen a parent cannot immediately go to the reunification site, students will only be released to individuals previously identified on the student Emergency Contact List. Otherwise, the school will hold students until parents can pick up their student.\nWHAT IF THE STUDENT DROVE TO SCHOOL?\nThere may be instances where a student may not be allowed to remove a vehicle from the parking lot. In this case, parents will be advised to pick up their student at the reunification site.\nFor parents, there are a couple of steps. If a parent is driving to the reunification site, greater awareness of traffic and emergency vehicles is advised. Parents should park where instructed to park by officials at the reunification site. Do not abandon your vehicle. Go to the reunification “check in” area and form lines based on the first letter of their student’s last name (if you have multiple students, you can check them all out in one line). Have your identification with you. While in line, parents will be asked to fill out a reunification form. This form is two part and will be separated by school officials during the process. Parents are asked to complete all parts of the form for each student you are picking up.\nBRING ID TO CHECK IN\nDuring check in, identification and custody rights are confirmed on every student. The form is separated and handed back to the parent. From the “Check In” area, parents are directed to the “Staging” area. There, a runner will take your form and go to the Student Assembly Area to retrieve the student(s).\nParents should be aware that in some cases, they may be invited into the building for further information.\nINTERVIEWS AND COUNSELING\nIn some instances, parents may be advised that a law enforcement investigation is underway and may be advised that interviews are necessary. In extreme cases, parents may be pulled inside for emergency or medical information. Please understand that this process will take time and we will work to ensure that everyone is delivered safely to their parent or guardian.

54	doctor error prevention communication best practices	To prevent medical errors, doctors should practice metacognition (thinking about their thinking) and be aware of cognitive biases. Key practices include spending more time with patients to get complete information, using interpreters when needed, avoiding pre-assessment bias during handovers, and ensuring proper rest and breaks. For effective communication, information should be disclosed in a quiet, private setting with adequate time allocated. The attending physician should deliver important information personally, use clear non-technical language, and be sensitive to the patient's comprehension level and cultural background. Documentation should be accurate, and all team members should maintain open, transparent communication to prevent errors from communication breakdowns.	['Cognition in Emergency Medicine\nWhy is this topic important?\n- Medicine is delivered by ‘humans’ to ‘humans’\n- Inevitably this is an error prone interaction\n- Tendency toward error is amplified by time pressures as well as high levels of emotional and physical stress\n- We have a lack of education on how to ‘think about thinking‘\nACEM 2015 – Emergency Physicians need to be expert diagnosticians of the patient AND themselves\nHow do Doctors make decisions?\n- Experienced clinicians are generally excellent “pattern recognisers“\n- Pattern recognition can be developed further with effort but it is an intrinsic human skill…\n- When asked by a non-expert to explain their actions experts often cannot articulate why they ‘do something’ (unconscious competence). Experts operate at the top of ‘Miller’s Pyramid‘:\n- As we become more experienced when we start seeing a new patient we subconsciously weigh the probabilities of the most likely diagnoses.\n- Diagnostic probabilities will change based on the information you gather and the tests you do. Working through ‘balance of probabilities’ can be done mathematically. This systematic approach was described by Thomas Bayes (1701-1761). The process of “Bayesian” Reasoning describes a way we think about probabilities.\n- In theory, working through this type of systematic reasoning should lead us to accurate and reproducible conclusions. However, in real life we are NOT good at knowing the probabilities and even worse at weighing these probabilities.\nHow do different staff think?\nThe Medical Student\n- Uses analytical thinking rather than intuition\n- The student or junior doctor when observed in their approach often appears to be in ‘Long case mode‘.\n- Typically, the inexperienced practitioner is deliberate with a great attention to detail. They are likely to have thought through the steps (without necessarily coming to the correct conclusion).\n- The student or inexperienced doctor cannot always recognise a ‘classic’ pattern. On occasion, they may fail to recognise either the obvious diagnosis or think of “ROAST” (‘ruling out all significant things’)\nThe Experienced Doctor\n- Pattern recognisers\n- Use Intuition rather than analytical thinking\n- Experienced clinicians mistakes are almost never ‘knowledge based’.\n- Errors are more commonly associated with ‘bias‘, communication or teamwork.\nTeamwork and communication can be improved though awareness and training.\nReducing errors requires us to think about the way we think. This process is known as ‘metacognition‘.\nPat Croskerry has famously described ‘cognitive biases’ in the context of Emergency Medicine. Cognitive bias can lead to failure to correctly weigh all the available information about the patient. This can lead to sub-optimal clinical reasoning. Time pressure, social cues, emotion, tiredness and hunger can all add to our potential bias\nEmergency Department biases include:\n- Confirmation Bias – positive information supporting your current position is overly valued whereas new negative information than may refute your current position is often either ignored or discarded.\n- Premature Diagnostic Closure has been glamorised by the likes of Hugh Laurie’s ‘House’ character. Dr House (pictured below) frequently makes obscure diagnoses with minimal information. In reality this is a highly dangerous error prone strategy when applied to our patients in the Emergency Department. This bias is some times referred to as search satisfaction\n- Availability Bias – refers to our perception that a diagnosis is more likely to be correct if it is commonly occurring or it readily comes to mind in the light of our recent experience.\n- Anchoring Bias – refers to our tendency to focus on to the features of the main presentation and narrow down too early. For example, a patient who has been put in the eye room must have ‘an eye problem’ or an patient triaged as ‘anxious’ must have a ‘psychological disorder’.\nBe humble – 93% of motorist think they are better than average drivers – How many doctors think they are better than average and as a result jump too quickly to their diagnosis?\nMore Cognitive Biases – Click Here\nSome Common Pitfalls leading to Cognitive Errors\n- An unwillingness to use interpreters is a classic problem in the ED. This can lead to a breakdown in communication with patient and their families. By using an interpreter, not only will you gather useful information about the patient, but you will also be able to give reliable advice to the non-english speaking family. Furthermore, interpreter use is associated with greatly increased patient satisfaction.\n- Cognitive Bias may increase if we spend less time with the patient. Therefore, spend MORE time with the patient and get a complete picture of what is going on.\n- Relying on our ‘medical expertise’ alone will lead an increase in our error. Human fallibly (being hungry, angry, late or overly tired) can be a simple cause of error – take your breaks and ensure your colleagues take their breaks too.\n- Use helpful decision “rules” but apply them to your individual patient mindfully.\n- Handover with bias can lead to a false diagnostic momentum:\n- Nurse: ‘can you review and send home the anxious lady in bed 6 with the hyperventilation, she’s pretty anxious.‘\n- You: ‘Sure, I’ll take a look and maybe send them home‘\n- Nurse ‘Thanks Doc – the department’s hectic tonight so lets get her home ASAP‘\n- Maybe the patient does have a benign anxiety attack or maybe she has a PE or DKA? One thing is for sure, you may not pick up on cues to a serious underlying problem if you carry in a significant pre-assessment bias.\n- A lack of awareness of potential cognitive errors will lead to you missing important pathology regardless of your level of medical expertise.', 'Disclosure of information is the process through which physicians explain clinical information to their patient (or surrogate decision-maker) in a way that the patient/surrogate can understand.\n- It is critical for patients to understand their own clinical situation and make informed decisions about their care.\n- All aspects of a patient’s clinical status should be disclosed and discussed with the decision-maker.\n- Underlying principles: autonomy, honesty, transparency\nDisclosure of information and informed consent\nDisclosure of information is a prerequisite for informed consent.\n- In order to make an informed decision, patients require all the relevant information necessary to make that choice.\n- This information typically includes (but is not limited to):\n- The patient’s diagnosis and prognosis\n- Recommended treatment, including side effects and risks of the treatment\n- Alternatives to the recommended treatment, including the risk of nontreatment\nFactors in favor of disclosure of information\n- Preservation of patient confidence/decreased patient anxiety\n- Eliminates uncertainty created by doubt (e.g., bad news is better than “always wondering”)\n- Increased patient compliance and adherence\n- Involvement of relatives and caregivers\n- Reduced probability of lawsuits\nHow to Adequately Disclose Information\nSetting and timing\n- Quiet and private setting; never with other patients or in a place where one can be overheard\n- An adequate amount of time must be allocated for discussion, especially for delicate information; do not rush the encounter.\n- A relative, clergy person, psychologist, and/or social worker may be present to support the patient when discussing serious information.\nWho is disclosing the information\n- Important information should always be disclosed by the attending physician; e.g.:\n- A new diagnosis (even if this diagnosis is not life threatening or “severe”)\n- Outcomes of a procedure\n- Lab results\n- When it is okay to delegate informing patients of lab results:\n- Always after the attending physician has reviewed the results\n- Information should only be delegated to a trained staff member, typically a nurse.\n- The disclosed information should not alter the plan of care already in place (e.g., informing a patient that their urine culture came back consistent with Escherichia coli and the current antibiotic they are on is appropriate therapy).\n- There should always be a way for patients/surrogates to discuss the information being disclosed with their physician should they have questions.\n- Relevant information regarding:\n- Recommended treatment\n- Alternative treatments and nontreatment\n- Complications that arise from both treatments and nontreatment\n- Information must be disclosed in a way that the patient/surrogate can fully understand.

With the patient, they should:\n- Begin by stating that an error occurred.\n- Physicians should disclose both harmful and non-harmful events\n- Harmful events must be disclosed to patients and families.\n- Never lie or try to hide a medical error.\n- Disclosing medical errors in a timely, professional, empathetic, and transparent manner helps maintain patient/family trust in the system.\n- According to the Code of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association, “physicians should at all times deal honestly and openly with patients.”\n- If medical errors are not disclosed to patients, but later discovered by the patient or family, the patient/family will lose trust in the treating team and is much more likely to take legal action.\n- Describe the course of events using plain, nontechnical language.\n- Use clear and concise terms to explain the error to the patient.\n- State the nature of the mistake, consequences, and corrective action.\n- Express personal regret and apologize.\n- Sincere apologies help patients understand that their team truly wants the best for them and that the mistake was an honest mistake.\n- Patients prefer apologies over statements of regret; e.g., “I’m sorry I caused you harm,” instead of “I’m sorry this happened to you.”\n- Maintains the physician–patient relationship\n- Decreases the risk of litigation\n- Answer all questions and address concerns.\n- Plan next steps with the patient.\n- Have, H., Gordijn, B.

55	sunni shiite influence west african islamic empire organizational structure	The Sokoto Caliphate emerged as a powerful Islamic empire in West Africa through a network of emirates, with each emir overseeing military, legal, and governmental affairs in their territory. This administrative structure operated within the broader context of Islamic traditions, where Muslims were divided into two major groups: Sunni Islam (representing 90 percent of Muslims) and Shiite Islam (about 10 percent). The Caliphate's governance system incorporated Islamic principles and law, similar to how both Sunni and Shiite traditions developed their own approaches to religious authority and administration. At its peak, the Caliphate governed a diverse population of around 10 million people across approximately 1.5 million square kilometers.	"['Discover the captivating history of the Sokoto Caliphate in pre-colonial West Africa – from its rise to power and enduring prestige to the unwavering perseverance of its leaders. Immerse yourself in a world of rich culture, religion, and politics, as you explore the legacy of this historic empire. Join us on a journey through time, and experience the power and resilience of the Sokoto Caliphate.\n1. Background of the Sokoto Caliphate\nThe Sokoto Caliphate was a powerful Islamic empire in West Africa that emerged in the early 19th century. Sheikh Usman dan Fodio, a religious scholar and leader, started it. It had a large area that included parts of Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon, and Benin today.\n2. Significance in West African History\nThe Sokoto Caliphate was one of the biggest and most powerful empires in West Africa before it was colonized. It had a big impact on the region’s politics, economy, and culture.\n3. Regional Dynamics in West Africa\na. Political landscape\nBefore the Sokoto Caliphate was formed, West Africa was made up of many small kingdoms, city-states, and tribal confederations with complicated alliances and rivalries.\nb. Trade and economic systems\nTrade was very important to these societies. Both trade within Africa and trade across the Sahara allowed for the exchange of goods and ideas.\n4. Islam in West Africa\na. Introduction and spread\nIslam entered West Africa through the trans-Saharan trade routes, and by the 9th century, it had become the dominant religion in several powerful kingdoms, including the Ghana Empire, Mali Empire, and Songhai Empire.\nb. Syncretism with local beliefs\nIslam and the local religions of West Africa often lived together and mixed, making a unique blend of Islamic and local beliefs.\nFormation of the Caliphate\n5. Sheikh Usman dan Fodio\na. Early life and education\nUsman dan Fodio was born in 1754 in Gobir, now part of Nigeria. He was well-educated in Islamic scholarship and became a prominent religious teacher and preacher.\nb. Religious and political philosophy\nDan Fodio’s teachings stressed the need for social and political reforms based on Islamic principles. This eventually led to the call for a jihad against non-Islamic rulers.\n6. The Fulani Jihad\na. Origins and motivations\nThe Fulani Jihad began in 1804 as a reaction to what the Fulani people saw as corruption and wrongdoing by the Hausa rulers of the area. The jihad aimed to establish a more just Islamic society.\nb. Key battles and turning points\nThe Fulani forces won a number of important battles, such as taking over Kebbi, Katsina, and Kano. By 1808, they had established the Sokoto Caliphate.\nPolitical and Administrative Structures\n7. Emirate System\na. Hierarchy and organization\nThe Sokoto Caliphate was made up of a network of emirates. An emir, who was in charge of the military, law, and government, oversaw each emirate.\nb. Roles and responsibilities\nEmirs were expected to keep law and order, collect taxes, and make sure that Islamic law was followed in their own areas.\n8. Sokoto Caliphate at its Zenith\na. Territorial expanse\nAt its peak, the Sokoto Caliphate covered approximately 1.5 million square kilometers, making it one of the largest empires in Africa at the time.\nb. Population and demographics\nThe Caliphate was home to a diverse population of around 10 million people, including the Fulani, Hausa, and various other ethnic groups.\nEconomy and Trade\n9. Agricultural Production\na. Crops and farming methods\nAgriculture was the most important part of the Sokoto Caliphate’s economy. Traditional farming methods were used to grow millet, sorghum, rice, and cotton. Irrigation systems were also employed to maximize agricultural productivity.\nb. Role of slavery\nSlavery was a big part of the agriculture industry. Slaves worked on large plantations to grow cash crops and help with other economic tasks.\n10. Trans-Saharan Trade\na. Key trade routes\nThe Sokoto Caliphate was connected to the wider world through trans-Saharan trade routes, which facilitated the exchange of goods, ideas, and people between West Africa, North Africa, and the Middle East.\nb. Major commodities\nSome of the most important things that were traded were gold, salt, slaves, farm products, and luxury goods like textiles and metalwork.imary commodities traded included gold, salt, slaves, and agricultural products, as well as luxury items such as textiles and metalwork.\nCulture and Society\n11. Language and Literature\na. Arabic influence\nArabic was a very important language in the Sokoto Caliphate because it was used for religion, learning, and running the government.\nb. Development of local literary traditions\nLocal languages like Hausa and Fulani also grew and developed a rich literary history with poetry, prose, and stories about the past.\n12. Art and Architecture\na. Mosques and palaces\nThe Sokoto Caliphate was known for its beautiful mosques and palaces, which were often made with local materials and building methods.\nb. Decorative arts\nArtists in the Sokoto Caliphate were very good at making pottery, metalwork, textiles, and calligraphy, among other decorative arts.\n13. Education and Scholarship\na. Islamic learning centers\nMany Quranic schools and Islamic learning centers were built all over the area during the Sokoto Caliphate, which was known for its schools.\nb. Notable scholars and works\nFrom the Sokoto Caliphate came famous scholars like Nana Asma’u, who was a poet, teacher, and the daughter of Usman dan Fodio, and Abdullahi dan Fodio, who wrote and thought a lot.\nDecline and Legacy\n14. Internal Challenges\na. Succession disputes\nThe political stability of the Caliphate was hurt by fights over who would be the next leader and who would have the most power.\nb. Administrative inefficiencies\nBecause the Caliphate was so big and its government wasn’t centralized, it wasn’t very efficient and it was hard to keep control over its territories.\n15. External Threats\na. European colonization\nIn the late 19th century, European colonial powers, especially the British, started to move into the Sokoto Caliphate. They wanted to use its resources and gain political control.\nb. Interactions with neighboring states\nThe Caliphate also faced challenges from neighboring states, which sought to undermine its influence and expand their own territories.\n16. The Fall of the Sokoto Caliphate\na. British conquest and colonization\nIn 1903, the British started a military campaign against the Sokoto Caliphate. They eventually beat the Caliphate’s forces and made the area part of Nigeria, which was a British colony.\nb. The aftermath and impact on the region\nAs European colonial rule replaced traditional political structures, the fall of the Sokoto Caliphate signaled the end of an era in West African history.\n17. The Sokoto Caliphate in Nigerian History\na. Post-colonial politics and nation-building\nNigerian politics are still affected by the history of the Sokoto Caliphate. The historical importance of the area affects current debates about federalism, regional autonomy, and national identity.\nb. Regional identities and tensions\nThe Caliphate’s legacy also plays a role in ongoing tensions between different ethnic and religious groups in Nigeria, as well as debates about the role of Islam in public life.\n18. Cultural and Historical Preservation\na. Museums and heritage sites\nThere have been efforts to keep the Sokoto Caliphate’s rich cultural and historical heritage alive. Museums and heritage sites have been set up to show its history and achievements.\nb. Challenges and opportunities\nDespite these efforts, preservation efforts face challenges such as limited funding, lack of public awareness, and threats posed by development projects and conflict.\nWho was Usman dan Fodio?\nUsman dan Fodio was a religious scholar and leader who started the Sokoto Caliphate at the beginning of the 19th century. He did this after leading the Fulani Jihad against the area’s non-Islamic rulers.\nWhat role did Islam play in the formation of the Sokoto Caliphate?\nIslam was a big part of how the Sokoto Caliphate came to be, because it gave Usman dan Fodio the ideas he needed to call for jihad and set up a more just Islamic society.\nHow did the Sokoto Caliphate affect West African trade and economy?\nThe Sokoto Caliphate was an important part of the West African economy, especially because it grew crops and traded with other countries across the Sahara.\nWhat factors led to the decline of the Sokoto Caliphate?\nThe decline of the Sokoto Caliphate can be traced to both internal problems, like fights over who would take over, and external problems, like threats from European colonial powers and other states.\nHow is the legacy of the Sokoto Caliphate relevant today?\nThe legacy of the Sokoto Caliphate is still important in Nigerian politics, regional identities, and efforts to protect the country’s rich cultural and historical heritage.\n19. Recap of Key Points\nThe Sokoto Caliphate was a powerful Islamic empire in West Africa before it was colonized. Sheikh Usman dan Fodio started it, and it had a significant impact on the area’s politics, economy, and culture. Its rise to power and eventual fall were both affected by how big it was, how many different kinds of people lived there, and how hard it was to run.\n20. Enduring Significance of the Sokoto Caliphate\nThe legacy of the Sokoto Caliphate remains relevant today, as it continues to shape contemporary Nigerian politics, regional identities, and efforts to preserve its rich cultural and historical heritage.', 'One of the three monotheistic world religions, Islam (Arabic for ""submission"") was founded in 7th-century Arabia by the Prophet Muhammad. Today, of the approximately 1 billion Muslims worldwide, less than one-fifth are Arab.\nThe community of all adherents of Islam is known as the ummah (nation), a term that embraces the sense of one Muslim people, overriding national and cultural boundaries.\nAt the core of Islam is the Koran, believed to be the word of Allah (Arabic for God) as revealed to Muhammad. Central to Muslim life are ""the five pillars"": The affirmation that ""there is no god but God, and Muhammad is the messenger of God,"" five daily prayers, giving alms, dawn-to-dusk fasting during the month of Ramadan, and the pilgrimage to Mecca.\nThe sources of Islamic doctrine are the Koran, the Hadith and Sunnah (the traditions and practices of the prophet), consensus (by leading Islamic scholars about issues on which the Koran, Hadith, and Sunna offer no guidance), and inference by analogy (when judges and scholars devise a solution based on precedent, again because there is no historical ruling).\nSharia (Islamic law) embraces all aspects of Muslim life - public and private, devotional and secular, civil and criminal - and was compiled by scholars and jurists during the first three centuries of Islam.\nAfter the prophet\'s death, Islam split into two major divisions over who should succeed as leader of the Muslim community. Sunni Islam followed a line of caliphs, starting with Abu Bakr, and Shiite Islam followed a hereditary line through Muhammad\'s son-in-law, Ali.\nSunni - The largest division encompassing 90 percent of all Muslims, Sunni Islam includes wide-ranging strands of interpretation, including the puritanical Wahhabis and the mystic Sufis.\nSunni Islam has four legal schools of thought - Hanafi, Maliki, Shafii, and Hanbali - which offer varying interpreta-tions of the canon law. The last, Hanbali, is the most conservative and rejects all sources of Islamic law except the Koran and the Hadith and Sunnah. It is the official school of Saudi Arabia and Qatar.\nWahhabi - Sunni puritanical movement founded by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (c. 1703-1791). Wahhabism rejects all religious practices adopted after the 3rd century of the Muslim era (after c. 950).\nThe histories of Wahhabism and of the Saud tribe - the ruling family of Saudi Arabia - have been closely linked since the foundation of the movement. Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, who considered it his religious duty to conquer all other forms of Islam, was unwelcome among Arabian tribes - except the Sauds. They formed a pact with him in 1744 and began their conquest of Arabia 20 years later.\nWahhabism remains the dominant sect in Saudi Arabia, which has spread its influence to other Muslim countries through financial support for religious education.\nShiite - From the Arabic shiat Ali, the party of Ali, Shiite Islam is the second largest sect, making up about 10 percent of all Muslims. The Shiite branch originated in the strife of succession following the Prophet Muhammad\'s death. Shiism began as a political movement supporting the claims of Ali, cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, to succeed the prophet as leader of the Muslim community.\nShiites are a minority in all Muslim countries except Azerbaijan and Iran, where Shiism was adopted as the state religion in the 16th century.\nSufi - A mystical movement developed in the 8th century in reaction to the perceived formalism and legalism of conventional Islam. (Some Muslims, such as Wahhabis, do not consider Sufis true Muslims.) The Sufis practiced a form of hermitic mysticism by withdrawing from the world and seeking a personal relationship and direct communication with God. Sufism, which developed religious orders and spread throughout the Muslim world, became a significant movement and vehicle for teaching Islam. The poet Rumi was a Sufi.\nAyatollah In Shiite Islam, the most learned of religious teachers and interpreters of the law.\nFatwa A legal opinion or decision by a religious leader on a matter of religious law.\nImam A leader of prayer in a mosque.\nJihad The terms means ""struggle in the path of God,"" but has been commonly co-opted by Islamist groups to mean armed struggle or holy war against infidels.\nMujahideen Holy warriors or ones who carry out a jihad.\nMullah A Muslim teacher or interpreter of Islamic law.\nSharia Islamic law (literally, the road to the water hole).\nSheikh A learned Muslim.\nTalib A student.\nUlema A council of Muslim scholars.']"	['<urn:uuid:4f92add9-dff1-40b7-99f0-3a7c6d09ec37>', '<urn:uuid:f57fb444-3cef-4e56-9697-4f0189075432>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	9	107	2261
56	As a wine enthusiast interested in fortification processes, could you explain how port wine achieves its distinctive sweetness and higher alcohol content compared to regular wines?	Port is made by adding clear grape spirit to wine before fermentation is complete. This process stops the fermentation, which means the sugars that would normally turn into alcohol remain as sugars. This results in a sweet, full-bodied fortified wine with an ABV of 20 percent, which is significantly stronger than regular wine.	['Port is a minefield of traditions through which the uninitiated tend to tread warily. Should you serve tawny, red or even white port? And what’s all that jazz about which way one should pass it?\nPort is always being touted by wine buffs as the next big thing in drinks because, like sherry, it’s a relatively niche drink in the UK which hasn’t really enjoyed a moment in the spotlight for many a decade.\nFashionable or not, it does enjoy a loyal following among those who simply couldn’t imagine Christmas without a glass of vintage port and a sliver of stilton. However, it’s also regarded as a bit posh, a situation compounded by the peculiar rules about it needing to be passed around the table in a certain direction. So if you’re a port newbie but up for adding this rich sip to your festive table, here’s the low-down.\nWine, spirit or liqueur?\nNone of the above: it’s a fortified wine. Port is made by adding clear grape spirit to wine before it has finished fermenting and it’s this process that results in the smooth, full bodied and sweet sip that’s so beloved by great aunts and cheese fiends. Adding the spirit stops the fermentation process so the sugars that would have turned to alcohol stay as sugars.\nA sip of history\nPort certainly enjoys a long and distinguished heritage – we’ve been drinking it for a couple of thousand years. It’s exclusively made in Portugal’s Douro Valley and, in 1756, the vineyard area became the first in the world to be legally demarcated, so you won’t find port made anywhere else.\nPick your port\nThe two most commonly drunk types of port are red and tawny.\nRed is aged for a relatively short amount of time in the barrel before being bottled. It can be drunk young or aged in the bottle for much longer to develop complexity. Purplish or crimson in colour, red port yields flavours of blackberry, raspberry and cinnamon.\nTawny port (or wood-aged port) is aged for a significantly longer period of time in wooden barrels and, on release, is dark amber in colour and bears nutty notes along with the flavours of dried fruits, caramel, fig and spice.\nAlso available is white port (usually served as an aperitif) and rosé port, which is growing in popularity and often served long and cold or as a cocktail ingredient.\nAgeing in style\nAge is a key way in which different types of port develop their characteristics. Tawny port is aged for anything from two to 40 years, developing its flavour profile with each passing year.\nIn the group of red ports, the most widely available is ruby port which is drunk young (not aged long in the bottle). It’s often at the cheaper end of the scale.\nAlso available are single quinta ports that originate from single estates and which can be very good.\nHowever, if you really want to treat your guests to fireside sipping par excellence, plump for vintage port (from a declared vintage) which is aged for two or three years in the barrel and then further (very occasionally for over 100 years) in the bottle. Also available are late bottled vintage ports, which are aged for four to six years in the barrel before being drunk young.\nTo decant or not to decant?\nThere’s something rather grand about passing the port around the table in a decanter, but you only need to decant ports that are aged in the bottle such as crusted port, vintage and late bottled vintage, as they’ll be the ones with sediment.\nPort is rather rich stuff and, with an ABV of 20 per cent, significantly stronger than wine so small servings are required.\nWhite and rosé ports are best served cold as an aperitif, while red and tawny ports are perfect after-dinner sips, especially with the cheese course.\nCool red and tawny ports slightly to serve – tawny a little cooler than red. And, as for passing the port, the rule is: left around the table in a clockwise rotation.']	['<urn:uuid:c5328ee9-ba84-4c06-951d-1dd3223ad1b1>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	26	53	682
57	computer scientist researching transparent vs opaque systems societal impacts machine learning	While black box systems are opaque with only inputs/outputs visible, white box (also called clear box or glass box) systems have inner components available for inspection. This distinction has important societal implications today - automated systems make crucial decisions in areas like lending, policing and hiring, but their lack of transparency raises concerns. As these computational systems can infer personal traits with high accuracy, there's growing pressure to implement standards of ethics and accountability to prevent systematic disadvantaging of certain groups.	"['In science, computing, and engineering, a black box is a device, system or object which can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs (or transfer characteristics), without any knowledge of its internal workings. Its implementation is ""opaque"" (black). Almost anything might be referred to as a black box: a transistor, algorithm, or the human brain.\nThe opposite of a black box is a system where the inner components or logic are available for inspection, which is most commonly referred to as a white box (sometimes also known as a ""clear box"" or a ""glass box"").\nThe modern term ""black box"" seems to have entered the English language around 1945. In electronic circuit theory the process of network synthesis from transfer functions, which led to electronic circuits being regarded as ""black boxes"" characterized by their response to signals applied to their ports, can be traced to Wilhelm Cauer who published his ideas in their most developed form in 1941. Although Cauer did not himself use the term, others who followed him certainly did describe the method as black-box analysis. Vitold Belevitch puts the concept of black-boxes even earlier, attributing the explicit use of two-port networks as black boxes to Franz Breisig in 1921 and argues that 2-terminal components were implicitly treated as black-boxes before that.\nIn cybernetics, a full treatment was given by Ross Ashby in 1956. A black box was described by Norbert Wiener in 1961 as an unknown system that was to be identified using the techniques of system identification. He saw the first step in self-organization as being to be able to copy the output behaviour of a black box.\nThe black box is an abstraction representing a class of concrete open systems which can be viewed solely in terms of its ""stimuli inputs"" and ""output reactions"". «The constitution and structure of the box are altogether irrelevant to approach under consideration, which is purely external or phenomenological. In other words, only the behavior of the system will be accounted for».\n- input and output being believed to be distinct,\n- having observable (and relatable) inputs and outputs,\n- being black to the observer (non-openable).\nRecording of observed states\nAn observer do observations over the time. All observations of inputs and outputs of a black box can be written in a table with the form:\n|↓Time||States of input and output|\nin which, at each of a sequence of times, the states of the box’s various parts, input and output, are recorded. Thus, using the Ashby\'s example, the box that fell from the Flying saucer might lead to the protocol:\n|↓Time||States of input and output|\n|11:18 a.m.||I did nothing—the Box emitted a steady hum at 240 c/s.|\n|11:19||I pushed over the switch marked K: the note rose to 480 c/s and remained steady.|\n|11.20||Accidentally I pushed the button marked “!”—the Box increased in temperature by 20°C.|\nThus every system, fundamentally, is investigated by the collection of a long protocol, drawn out in time, showing the sequence of input and output states. From this there follows the fundamental deduction that all knowledge obtainable from a Black Box (of given input and output) is such as can be obtained by re-coding the protocol (the observation table); all that, and nothing more.\nThe modeling process is the construction of a predictive mathematical model, using existing historic data (observation table).\nTesting black box model\nSee also Backtesting: inputs for past events (not used in the ""modeling effort"") are entered into the model to see how well the output matches the known results.\n- In computer programming and software engineering, black box testing is used to check that the output of a program is as expected, given certain inputs. The term ""black box"" is used because the actual program being executed is not examined.\n- In computing in general, a black box program is one where the user cannot see its inner workings (perhaps because it is a closed source program) or one which has no side effects and the function of which need not be examined, a routine suitable for re-use.\n- Also in computing, a black box refers to a piece of equipment provided by a vendor, for the purpose of using that vendor\'s product. It is often the case that the vendor maintains and supports this equipment, and the company receiving the black box typically are hands-off.\n- In neural networking or heuristic algorithms (computer terms generally used to describe \'learning\' computers or \'AI simulations\') a black box is used to describe the constantly changing section of the program environment which cannot easily be tested by the programmers. This is also called a white box in the context that the program code can be seen, but the code is so complex that it is functionally equivalent to a black box.\n- In physics, a black box is a system whose internal structure is unknown, or need not be considered for a particular purpose.\n- In mathematical modelling, a limiting case.\n- In philosophy and psychology, the school of behaviorism sees the human mind as a black box; see black box theory.\n- In neorealist international relations theory, the sovereign state is generally considered a black box: states are assumed to be unitary, rational, self-interested actors, and the actual decision-making processes of the state are disregarded as being largely irrelevant. Liberal and constructivist theorists often criticize neorealism for the ""black box"" model, and refer to much of their work on how states arrive at decisions as ""breaking open the black box"".\n- In cryptography to capture the notion of knowledge obtained by an algorithm through the execution of a cryptographic protocol such as a zero-knowledge proof protocol. If the output of the algorithm when interacting with the protocol can be simulated by a simulator that interacts only the algorithm, this means that the algorithm \'cannot know\' anything more than the input of the simulator. If the simulator can only interact with the algorithm in a black box way, we speak of a black box simulator.\nBlack Box theory is, however, even wider in application than these professional studies:\nThe child who tries to open a door has to manipulate the handle (the input) so as to produce the desired movement at the latch (the output); and he has to learn how to control the one by the other without being able to see the internal mechanism that links them. In our daily lives we are confronted at every turn with systems whose internal mechanisms are not fully open to inspection, and which must be treated by the methods appropriate to the Black Box.\n— W. Ross Ashby, AN INTRODUCTION TO CYBERNETICS, 1957\nOther uses of the term\n- In aviation, the flight recorder is often called a ""black box"", especially by the media, although it is usually bright orange to facilitate their being found after a crash. In an airplane or helicopter, the flight recorder records the conversation of the pilots and also logs information about controls and sensors. If an accident happens, investigators can use the recordings to assist in the investigation.\n- In amateur radio the term ""black box operator"" is a disparaging or self-deprecating description of someone who operates factory made radios without having a good understanding of how they work. Such operators do not build their own equipment (an activity called ""homebrewing"") or repair their own ""black boxes"".\n- W. Cauer. Theorie der linearen Wechselstromschaltungen, Vol.I. Akad.

In her 2016 book, Weapons of Math Destruction, she cites some troubling examples in the United States:\nPublic schools in Washington, D.C. in 2010 fired more than 200 teachers—including several well-respected instructors—based on scores in an algorithmic formula which evaluated performance.\nA man diagnosed with bipolar disorder was rejected for employment at seven major retailers after a third-party “personality” test deemed him a high risk based on its algorithmic classification.\nMany jurisdictions are using “predictive policing” to shift resources to likely “hot spots.” O’Neill says that depending on how data is fed into the system, this could lead to discovery of more minor crimes and a “feedback loop” which stigmatizes poor communities.\nSome courts rely on computer-ranked formulas to determine jail sentences and parole, which may discriminate against minorities by taking into account “risk” factors such as their neighborhoods and friend or family links to crime.\nIn the world of finance, brokers “scrape” data from online and other sources in new ways to make decisions on credit or insurance. This too often amplifies prejudice against the disadvantaged, O’Neil argues.\nHer findings were echoed in a White House report last year warning that algorithmic systems “are not infallible—they rely on the imperfect inputs, logic, probability, and people who design them.”\nThe report noted that data systems can ideally help weed out human bias but warned against algorithms “systematically disadvantaging certain groups.”\nZeynep Tufekci, a University of North Carolina professor who studies technology and society, said automated decisions are often based on data collected about people, sometimes without their knowledge. “These computational systems can infer all sorts of things about you from your digital crumbs,” Tufekci said in a recent TED lecture. “They can infer your sexual orientation, your personality traits, your political leanings. They have predictive power with high levels of accuracy.”\nSuch insights may be useful in certain contexts—such as helping medical professionals diagnose postpartum depression—but unfair in others, she said. Part of the problem, she said, stems from asking computers to answer questions that have no single right answer. “They are subjective, open-ended and value-laden questions, asking who should the company hire, which update from which friend should you be shown, which convict is more likely to reoffend.”\nFrank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor and author of The Black Box Society: The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information, shares the same concerns. He suggests one way to remedy unfair effects may be to enforce existing laws on consumer protection or deceptive practices.\nPasquale points at the European Union’s data protection law, set from next year to create a “right of explanation” when consumers are impacted by an algorithmic decision, as a model that could be expanded. This would “either force transparency or it will stop algorithms from being used in certain contexts,” he said.\nAlethea Lange, a policy analyst at the Center for Democracy and Technology, said the E.U. plan “sounds good” but “is really burdensome” and risked proving unworkable in practice. She believes education and discussion may be more important than enforcement in developing fairer algorithms.\nLange said her organization worked with Facebook, for example, to modify a much-criticized formula that allowed advertisers to use “ethnic affinity” in their targeting.\nOthers meanwhile caution that algorithms should not be made a scapegoat for societal ills. “People get angry and they are looking for something to blame,” said Daniel Castro, vice president at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. “We are concerned about bias, accountability and ethical decisions but those exist whether you are using algorithms or not.”']"	['<urn:uuid:b949e810-3748-4ea0-a4b8-2e98d8400117>', '<urn:uuid:6ac4c8f9-4485-43b7-b764-b48a249516fb>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	11	81	2245
58	data safety law requirements europe worldwide	The GDPR establishes privacy rights for individuals in the European Economic Area, requiring appropriate technical safeguards for data protection regardless of where the data is stored globally. Under ISO 27001's guidance, organizations should use encryption particularly for sensitive data in transit, removable devices, and remote network connections. The regulation applies to any organization offering services to EEA individuals or monitoring their behavior, even if the organization is outside Europe. Organizations must implement proper cryptographic controls and ensure third parties receiving the data adopt the same protections through contractual terms.	"['Encryption is one of the most important tools that modern businesses have at their disposal. Confidential information is their lifeblood, and it’s constantly flowing through their systems – between databases, removable devices, emails and suppliers.\nIf organisations don’t take appropriate steps to protect sensitive information, they increase the risk of it being compromised.\nISO 27001, the international standard that describes best practice for an ISMS (information security management system), covers data encryption in Annex A.10.\nIn this blog, we explain everything you need to know about encryption and ISO 27001’s cryptographic controls.\nWhat is encryption?\nEncryption is a mechanism that scrambles data into an unreadable code. Anyone who wishes to interpret the information needs a decryption key, which reverts the information into its original form.\nA basic example of encryption would be replacing one letter with another so that, for instance, the letters of the ‘Hello’ might be transposed one letter to the left on a standard keyboard to read: “Gwkki”.\nIn a cyber security context, encryption is more sophisticated than that, creating a code that is complex enough that it couldn’t be deciphered without the decryption key.\nCloudflare uses this as an example of what an encrypted piece of data might look like:\nIt adds: “Although encrypted data appears random, encryption proceeds in a logical, predictable way, allowing a party that receives the encrypted data and possesses the right key to decrypt the data, turning it back into plaintext.”\nISO 27001 and encryption\nOrganisations can find guidance on encryption in Annex A.10 of ISO 27001. It explains how cryptographic controls can protect sensitive information in transit and at rest.\nThe Annex provides a definition of and rules for the use of cryptographic solutions. It also provides specific technical guidance, explaining which algorithms and key sizes must be used in certain situation.\nLikewise, it contains information on the way organisations should manage cryptographic keys, when keys need to be created, who is responsible for them and where they should be stored.\nIs encryption required by the GDPR?\nData encryption is not mandatory under the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).\nHowever, that is because the Regulation is deliberately vague on the use of specific technologies. It understands that technological best practices are subject to change, and what is appropriate now might not be in several years’ time.\nIt does not mean that the GDPR doesn’t recommend the use of cryptographic controls. In fact, encryption is suggested under Article 32, which requires organisations to adopt “appropriate technical and organisational measures” to protect personal data.\nThe Regulation notes that, where applicable, this might include pseudonymising or encrypting sensitive information.\nOrganisations can determine whether encryption is appropriate by conducting a DPIA (data protection impact assessment).\nThese assessments are mandatory where processing could result in a high risk to data subjects, and they help organisations determine relevant safeguards that are appropriate to the risk.\nWhen to use cryptographic controls\nAlthough encryption is invaluable for protecting sensitive data, organisations should be careful about when they use it. That’s because using the wrong cryptographic techniques can create vulnerabilities themselves.\nLikewise, as with all information security measures, the use of encryption comes at a cost. The key to successful security management is knowing how to balance the benefits of security measures with the challenges that they present.\nEncryption is most often appropriate for data in transit – i.e. when it’s moving from one location to another, such as by email. In these instances, encryption ensures that the information remains safe should an unauthorised actor intercept the message.\nOrganisations might also choose to encrypt data at rest – i.e. when it’s on their systems. This protects the information should a criminal hacker break into their systems.\nHowever, encryption for data at rest is less common for several reasons. First, it essentially doubles the amount of the space required to store the information, because the file contains both the encrypted information plus the original data.\nAdditionally, encrypting information makes it harder to access for legitimate reasons. Every time an employee wants to access the data, it must be decrypted, and whenever they make changes, it must be re-encrypted.\nEncryption also slows the processing and transmission of information. This might not be a major problem with end-to-end encryption for email, for example, where there is relatively little information being shared.\nBut if you are transferring a large document, it will take considerably longer to send if the information is encrypted. You therefore need to decide whether the security benefits are appropriate to the inconvenience caused.\nAs a rule, encryption should be used whenever there is a significant risk of confidential information being improperly accessed. This includes the use of devices that leave the organisation’s premises, such as removeable devices, external hard drives or laptops.\nOrganisations should also consider encrypting websites that ask users to enter their username or password, or e-commerce platforms that handle payment card transactions.\nEncryption is also recommended when employees connect to the corporate network while working remotely.\nImplementing a cryptography policy\nOrganisations that use encryption tools must implement a cryptographic policy. This ensures that encryption is used consistently and appropriately.\nA cryptographic policy should cover:\n- Staff awareness training on the benefits of encryption and how to use the technology;\n- A risk assessment process that addresses the quality, strength and type of encryption algorithm;\n- How and when encryption will be used for portable media devices;\n- Organisational roles and responsibilities for managing cryptographic controls; and\n- Any relevant laws governing the use of encryption.\nSimplify your ISO 27001 requirements with Compliance Manager\nYou can find more advice on ISO 27001 and encryption with our Compliance Manager tool.\nIt contains everything you need to strengthen your information security processes and achieve ISO 27001 compliance.\nIt provides a curated list of information security clauses from UK law and a collection of GDPR articles, each accompanied by implementation guidance.\nYou can also add your own requirements or controls that are applicable to your organisation.\nCompliance Manager’s interactive database lists the applicable clauses from each law and provides guidance on implementing them, mapped against the appropriate best-practice controls from Annex A of ISO 27001.\nThe post A Guide to ISO 27001’s Cryptographic Controls appeared first on Vigilant Software – Compliance Software Blog.\n*** This is a Security Bloggers Network syndicated blog from Vigilant Software – Compliance Software Blog authored by Luke Irwin.

It is intended to be an overarching privacy regulation for all EU Member States and replaces prior EU privacy regulations and goes even further than benchmark United States privacy laws governing health care and educational records, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).\nWhat does GDPR do?\nGDPR expands privacy rights for individuals located in the EEA regardless of citizenship. Specifically, it guarantees certain rights, depending on how the data is used:\nThe right to be informed regarding the collection and intended use of a subject’s personal data,\nThe ability to make informed decisions regarding the use and disclosure of the data,\nThe right to access the data upon request or have the data transferred to a third party, and\n- The right to have the data returned or deleted.\nIt also impacts data pertaining to these individuals even when the data is located in other countries, regardless of the citizenship of the individuals. Specifically, the GDPR establishes a framework for safeguarding how personal data is used, such as:\nEnsuring that the data is transferred, processed, stored and eventually disposed of using appropriate technical safeguards,\nLimiting the use/processing of the data to purposes that comply with GDPR requirements (e.g., managing the academic records of UC students studying in the EEA as part of Education Abroad),\nRequiring third parties who receive the data to adopt UC’s GDPR protections and safeguards through changes to contract terms.\nWho does GDPR apply to?\nGDPR applies to all organizations that are established in the EEA, including higher education institutions (e.g., a study center in Europe). It also applies to organizations not physically in the EEA when goods or services are offered to individuals in the EEA (e.g., applications for admissions), or when the behavior of individuals in the EEA are monitored by individuals either inside or outside of the EEA (e.g., research that includes EU citizens).\nAre there penalties for GDPR non-compliance?\nYes, GDPR imposes significant monetary penalties for organizations that do not comply with the regulation. The fines are up to €20M ($28M) or 4% of global revenue.\nWhat is the UCB Privacy Office doing to comply with GDPR?\nThe Privacy Office established a Working Group to address issues that are specific to the impact of GDPR at our campus.\nThe Working Group is comprised of representatives from key sectors likely to be impacted by the regulation and who will drive implementation efforts here at Berkeley, including Privacy, Compliance, Legal Affairs, Information Technology, Security, Risk Management, Insurance Services, and others. The primary goal of the Working Group will be to develop guidelines, processes, and policy changes to be implemented at Berkeley to promote compliance with GDPR.\nThe Privacy Office is also working closely with the UC Office of the President (UCOP) and the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) in accordance with their system-wide GDPR efforts as listed below.\nUC Berkeley's Statement of Privacy Practices - GDPR\nUC Berkeley's Statement of Privacy Practices for Persons in the European Economic Area Subject to GDPR explains how we comply with GDPR and indicates your rights regarding your Personal Data\nWhat is the University of California (UC) doing to comply with GDPR?\nUC’s compliance, privacy and informational technology programs are working together to develop an effective GDPR compliance program. This program is specifically designed to enhance the existing robust privacy infrastructure at UC to ensure compliance with this new regulation.\nProgram activities include:\n- Assessing how GDPR will affect UC programs\n- Developing tools and templates to assist UC programs with GDPR compliance\n- Developing communication tools to provide greater transparency to UC students, employees, and other UC program participants regarding the collection and use of personal data\n- Ensuring that appropriate physical and technical safeguards are in place to protect the personal data of individuals\n- Working with our partners and vendors to ensure that data protections are maintained when personal data is transferred outside UC\nWhat can I do to prepare my office for GDPR?\n- Understand GDPR:\n- Determine if GDPR applies:\n- Develop a plan:\n- Review Tools & Resources created by UCB, and UCOP, and start working on a plan for your Department\n- Stay informed:\n- Review FAQs from UCB, UCOP, and selected external partners\n- Visit GDPR.berkeley.edu regularly for updates\nFor questions relating to GDPR and its impact at UCB, please contact the Privacy Office""]"	['<urn:uuid:b1f58c12-1551-4bd5-bccb-67e33019edc6>', '<urn:uuid:f9242506-b63b-4295-b069-8fa423e70d6d>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	6	89	1851
59	How does the role of administrative leadership compare between the UN system and the Australian governmental structure in terms of executive authority and decision-making power?	In the UN system, executive authority flows from the Secretary-General's bulletins and administrative instructions, which are lower in the hierarchy than the Charter, resolutions, and staff regulations. In the Australian system, executive power is vested in the Queen and exercisable by the Governor-General, but in practice, this power is exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister and ministers who have day-to-day governing responsibility. The Governor-General, while holding formal executive power, doesn't have authority to make decisions on behalf of the government independently. This differs from the UN system where administrative leadership has clearly defined powers within the hierarchical structure, though subordinate to higher normative sources like the Charter and resolutions.	"['What is the hierarchy of norms in the UN legal order?\nLast Updated: Oct 15, 2019\nA ""hierachy of norms"" refers to the order or importance in which a norm is considered within a legal system. For matters internal to the organization, the hierarchy of norms in the UN has been set out in certain judgments of the Dispute Tribunal as follows:\n- Charter of the United Nations\n- Resolutions and decisions\n- Staff regulations\n- Staff rules\n- Secretary-General\'s bulletins\n- Administrative instructions\nFrom Villamoran v. Secretary-General of the United Nations (UNDT/2011/056), paragraph 29:\nAt the top of the hierarchy of the Organization’s internal legislation is the Charter of the United Nations, followed by resolutions of the General Assembly, staff regulations, staff rules, Secretary-General’s bulletins, and administrative instructions (see Hastings UNDT/2009/030, affirmed in Hastings 2011-UNAT-109; Amar UNDT/2011/040). Information circulars, office guidelines, manuals, and memoranda are at the very bottom of this hierarchy and lack the legal authority vested in properly promulgated administrative issuances.\nLegal opinions of the Secretariat and Advisory Opinions of the International Court of Justice may also provide information on the interpretation of legal matters within the UN.\n- The UN Juridical Yearbook includes, among other useful information:\n- A general review of the legal activities of the UN\n- Selected decisions of the administrative tribunals of the UN\n- Selected legal opinions of the secretariats of the UN\n- Selected judicial decisions on questions relating to the UN from both international and national tribunals\nMore broadly, Schermers and Blokker, in International Institutional Law, 5th rev. ed, 2011, section 1145, state:\nThe constitution sets the pattern for the legal order of the international organization. Further rules develop from the operation of its organs. The power of these organs to take decisions stems from the constitution. From this common source, a hierarchy of the various legal rules is developed, and a single legal order thus created. The validity of each rule will depend on the constitution, the basis of the legal order.\nIn the larger context of the international community and its legal order, the role of the Charter in public international law in general is a topic of scholarly debate. Many books, articles, courses and lectures concern the position of the UN Charter within the hierarchy (or hierarchies) of norms in public international law.\nSome key terms are: hierarchy of norms, conflict of norms, fragmentation of international law, unity of international law, interpretation, jus cogens, obligations, international system, international legal order, sources of international law\nSome key provisions are:\n- Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, concerns sources of international law\n- Article 103 of the Charter, concerns conflict between the Charter and other treaty obligations\n- Article 30 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, concerns Article 103 of the Charter and other treaties\n- Articles 31-33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, concern interpretation of treaties\nNational and international courts and tribunals may be called upon to interpret treaty provisions\n- For example, see discussions of the Kadi cases in the European Union courts, which concerned, in part, the relationship between obligations of UN Member States under Chapter VII of the Charter and their obligations under other elements of the international legal order, such as EU regulations.\nDisclaimer: answers are prepared by library staff using resources available at the time of writing. This site may include links and references to third-party databases, websites, books and articles, this does not imply endorsement by the United Nations.', ""Separation of Powers: Parliament, Executive and Judiciary\nThe Australian Constitution is the set of rules by which Australia is run. The first three chapters of the Constitution define three largely separate groups – the Parliament, the Executive and the Judiciary – and the roles they play in Australian governance. The power to make and manage federal law is divided between these three groups. This division is based on the principle of the 'separation of powers'.\nUnder this principle, the power to govern should be distributed between the Parliament, the Executive and the Judiciary to avoid one group having all the power. Each group should work within defined areas of responsibility so that each keeps a check on the actions of the others.\nSeparation of roles\n|Parliament||The Parliament makes and amends the law||Parliament (also referred to as the Legislature) is made up of the Queen (represented by the Governor-General), the Senate and the House of Representatives|\n|Executive||The Executive puts the law into action||The Executive is made up of the Queen (represented by the Governor-General), Prime Minister and ministers|\n|Judiciary||The Judiciary makes judgements about the law||The Judiciary is made up of the High Court and other federal courts|\nExceptions to the principle\nAustralia does not have a complete separation of powers because some of the roles of the Parliament, the Executive and the Judiciary overlap. For example, the Prime Minister and ministers are part of the Executive and the Parliament. High Court judges, the Prime Minister and ministers are officially appointed by the Governor-General, who is part of the Parliament and the Executive.\nThe role of the Governor-General\nSection 61 of the Constitution states that ‘the executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor-General as the Queen’s representative’. This means that the Governor-General has been given certain powers to act on behalf of the Queen. However, the role of the Governor-General is not just defined by the Constitution, but also by custom and tradition.While executive power is exercised by the Governor-General, in reality this is normally done on the advice of the Prime Minister and ministers, who have day-to-day responsibility for governing Australia. The Governor-General does not have the authority to make decisions on behalf of the government, but has a role in both the government and the Parliament (see Governor-General).\nThe separation of powers works together with another principle known as responsible government, to guide the way law is made and managed. Responsible government means that a party, or coalition of parties, must maintain the support of the majority of members of the House of Representatives in order to remain in government. This provides another check on the Executive, ensuring they remain accountable to the Parliament and do not abuse their power.\nThe origins of the principle of the separation of powers can be traced back as far as ancient Greece. It was made popular much later by French philosopher Charles de Montesquieu in 1748 in his work L'Esprit des Lois (the Spirit of the Laws). He wrote that a nation's freedom depended on the three powers of governance—legislative, executive and judicial—each having their own separate institution. This principle has been widely used in the development of many democracies since that time.""]"	['<urn:uuid:4421b097-29d4-44a8-9f06-7a8421db0919>', '<urn:uuid:d4bd4d1f-395f-4da3-bd3a-546c5c51bd5a>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	25	111	1129

This disturbes the animals' habitat and may force them to enter habitats which are already occupied. This can pose many problems such as territorial conflicts, homelessness (loss of habitat), lack of food availability, migration disturbances, etc.\n- Soil erosion occurs when trees and plants are removed; the rain water washes the nutrients in the top soil away.\n- Changes in watershed geomorphology.\n- Desertification (dry, hot, arid conditions).\n- Edge effects can change microclimates (small climates) which affect endemic species (native species which can only live in specific environmental and habitat conditions).\n- Climate change (more carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, thus increasing the effects of global warming).\n- Pollution (ground, water and air pollution from oil extraction and mining chemicals).\n- Loss of culture (indigenous peoples subsistence living in the rainforest). People who live in the rainforest depend on the natural environment for food, shelter, materials for cooking, clothing, etc. If the forest is cut down or if their environment becomes polluted from oil extraction and mining, they are forced to move or risk starvation and sickness.\n- Displacement of people (loss of farmland, forest resources, etc).\n- Social conflicts and struggles over land and natural resources.\n- Conflicts over racial and ethnic rights.\n- Poisoning from oil and mining waste.\n- Economic uncertainty (price fluctuations and high interest rates on outstanding international loans with The World Bank and International Monetary Fund.\nWhat can we do to STOP or at least lessen the amount of deforestation and conserve our own use of natural resources such as wood, oil and gas, electricity, minerals and elements, and water? Brainstorm...here's a start:\n- Always use both sides of paper when writing, drawing, photo-copying, faxing, etc.\n- Recycle paper, cans, glass, and plastic.\n- Read the newspaper on-line.\n- Buy paper products made from recycled paper: notebook paper, paper towels, toilet paper, books, etc.\n- Use pencils until they are stubs! Think of pencils as gold (you'll never lose them if you do).\n- Encourage your parents, relatives, and friends to buy furniture and wood that is Certified. That means the wood was legally cut-down.\n- If you buy a product and you notice they use wood chips to package it, write to the company and suggest they use another packaging material.\n- Trees get cut down for cattle to graze. Instead of eating meat, think of eating other sources of protein such as fish, soy, beans, whole-wheat, and nuts.\n- Buy organic fruits and vegetables. That means there are no insecticides or pesticides (poisonous chemicals) sprayed on the food. If these chemicals kill insects and pests that try and eat the vegetables, think about how harmful they can be to you and the environment.\n- Instead of buying gold or diamonds, which are mined and cause environmental damage, consider jewelry that is made from materials that are not mined...such as glass.\n- Encourage your parents, relatives, and friends to drive fuel efficient cars that get good gas mileage. Hybrid and bio-diesel cars get great mileage and use less or no gasoline.\n- Even better, whenever possible, walk, bike, carpool or use mass transit (bus or train).\n- Save electricity by turning off lights, t.v., radio, computer, etc when you are not using them.\n- Save water by NOT taking baths; instead take quick showers (turning off the water while you soap up) and then turning it back on to rinse quickly.\n- While washing your hands and brushing your teeth, turn off the water. You'll save gallons if you do.\n- When washing the dishes or your parent's car, turn off the water while washing it with soap. Rinse quickly after washing.\n- Hmmm, can you think of other ways to conserve wood, oil and gas, electricity, minerals and elements, and water, etc...? Brainstorm with your pen pal or a family member.\nOkay, now show YOURSELF what you have LEARNED by answering the following questions:\n- What does deforestation mean? (Hint: The prefix de- means to remove or reduce).\n2. Why does deforestation happen? For what purpose(s)?\n3. The largest rainforest in the world is located in:\na.) The Philipines\nb.)

The Origins of the War of -- Translated and edited by Isabella M. Massy.', 'Commemorating a battle that turned history’s tide\nSeventy years ago, the fate of the world lay in Stalingrad. Today the battle there is commemorated in various monuments around the city now known as Volgograd. Photos by William Brumfield.\nSeventy years ago, on January 10, 1943, one of the most important battles in world history, the struggle for Stalingrad, entered its final agonizing days. On that day General (later Marshal) Konstantin Rokossovsky launched Operation Ring, which would ultimately lead to the annihilation of the remains of the German Sixth Army, encircled in the city.\nView Larger Map\nInnumerable books, films and other publications have described and analyzed the Battle of Stalingrad, including two masterpieces: Vassily Grossman’s “Life and Fate” and Viktor Nekrasov’s “In the Trenches of Stalingrad.” To this day the epic character of the battle has lost none of its power to grip the human imagination.\nHistorians generally place the beginning of the Stalingrad campaign in July 1942, as the German Sixth Army, commanded by General Friedrich Paulus and aided by Italian and Rumanian allies, plunged into the south of Russia. Indeed, the advance seemed so overwhelming, that Hitler and his generals embarked on a strategic overreach that would have disastrous consequences.\nIn a more narrow sense, the beginning of the battle can be dated to the concentrated Luftwaffe bombing of the city on Aug. 23. Despite the enormous destruction, there were yet again unintended consequences. The rubble-filled, destroyed city center allowed the Red Army to engage in deadly, effective close-quarter combat.\nUnder these circumstances, the German tactical advantage in open warfare was negated, as was their initially overwhelming air superiority. Tanks had little room to maneuver and planes could not bomb without the risk of hitting German lines.\nOn July 27 Stalin issued the famous order “Not a step back,” and thus began a battle of attrition that showed the best qualities of Soviet tenacity and supply organization. Holding on to the slimmest of territories, Soviet forces—including the legendary 62nd Army commanded by General Vassily Chuikov, tied Germans forces down until the great Soviet counterstroke, known as “Operation Uranus,” was launched under the supervision of General (later Marshal) Georgy Zhukov on Nov. 19.\nA massive pincer operation was successfully concluded on Nov. 23, 1942, when Red Army units from north and south linked at the town of Kalach, far behind the main German forces. An air relief effort was successfully repulsed, and the Sixth Army slowly starved as promised air supplies dwindled to a trickle.\nOn Jan. 10, “Operation Ring” commenced. Soviet commanders had underestimated the size of the German force they had trapped, and over three more weeks of fighting ensued before the surrender of Fieldmarshal Paulus and his forces on Feb. 2. Indeed, isolated pockets of disorganized resistance continued until the beginning of March.\nThe Soviet triumph was complete, but at enormous cost. There were perhaps as many as 800,000 Axis losses and a similar number of Soviet troops and civilians. Although millions more were to die before the final capitulation of Nazi Germany in May 1945, after Stalingrad, German armies never regained the strategic initiative in the East.\nThe titanic scale of the struggle and its potent symbolism ultimately led to a memorial whose dimensions are appropriately vast. Individual statues and other monuments are spread along the Volga River and its tree-lined Embankment of the 62nd Army. At certain points tank turrets on pedestals mark the line of defense just a short distance to the Volga River.\nIn addition, there are more substantial memorials, including the remains of buildings that became defining points in the conflict. One such structure is a memorial known as “Pavlov’s House,” which before the war was a four-story apartment house in an elite area near the Volga embankment.\nThe building was subsequently named in honor of Sergeant Yakov Pavlov who, with two comrades, set up a defensive post near German lines on Sept. 23. Reinforced the next day, the house withstood all German attacks until Nov. 25, when the area was retaken by Soviet forces. The severely damaged house was rebuilt, and in 1985 the side facing the Volga became the site of a memorial wall commemorating the defense.\nNearby is a plaza containing the distinctive, round Stalingrad Battle Museum, which includes a display of vintage military equipment. Its second floor features a large panorama depicting a phase of the battle. The most impressive feature of the square, however, is the massive ruin of a flour mill built in 1903 by the Volga German Alexadner Gerhardt.\nGerhardt died at the hands of the Soviet secret police in 1933, but in an overwhelming irony, the building that he so solidly constructed to withstand the vibrations of heavy milling machinery became a central point in the Soviet defense against the Nazis. Even in ruined form, it was strong enough to stand as a vivid reminder of the battle’s destructive power.\nBut the center of the city’s memorial ensemble—its high point in the most literal sense—is called Mamayev Kurgan, a small hill resembling a burial mound (kurgan) and popularly associated (despite no historical evidence) with a 14th-century Tatar ruler, Mamai. Because of its commanding position, Mamayev Kurgan became one of the most intensely fought over pieces of ground in the history of the war, as German and Soviet positions constantly changed.\nBecause of its height and symbolism, the small hill that remained of Mamayev Kurgan became the center of the memorial construction, which took place between 1959-1967. From the main entrance near the Volga embankment, the memorial ascends through a path that leads past monumental friezes and statues. Approaching the top, visitors enters the Hall of Martial Glory, with its eternal flame and the walls with names of tens of thousands who fought.\nThe crowning element is the statue “The Motherland Calls,” a female figure with a sword raised in her right hand and the left arm extending in a gesture summoning to battle. Designed by Yevgeny Vuchetich, it is one of the largest free-standing monuments in the world – 278 feet from the bottom of the figure to the tip of the raised sword. The statue rests on a pedestal 49 feet high.\nThe east side of Mamayev Kurgan is also the site of burial markers, including that of Marshal Vassily Chuikov, whose courageous leadership of the 62nd army under continuous fire will live forever in the history of the battle. From the top of this stunning memorial, a grand vista opens with the broad Volga River and the vast steppe beyond to the east. But at a critical moment in world history, there was no place to retreat.\nStalingrad stood, and the fate of the world turned.']"	['<urn:uuid:f34f2c63-cf50-4308-8eed-dafe92d8ee22>', '<urn:uuid:11e28c72-ce82-4f25-94b2-78d67dabee51>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	12	41	2447
62	Do rugby and baseball both help with fitness and strength?	Yes, both sports provide physical benefits but in different ways. Rugby develops cardiovascular fitness, endurance, and both upper and lower body strength through activities like sprinting, tackling, pushing and kicking. Baseball, while seemingly gentler, builds strength particularly in the trunk, legs, and hips which are crucial for throwing velocity. Both sports require specific muscular development - rugby needs overall body strength for contact situations, while baseball particularly targets rotator cuff muscles and arm strength for throwing.	['The Health Benefits of Rugby\nThe health benefits of rugby are plenty of and varied, and also at the most basic level, rugby is like a method of increasing the time spent doing exercise.\nRugby is a popular sport that needs strength, endurance and fitness. Around australia, both Rugby League and Rugby Union codes are played. Rugby is greatly a contact sport and involves two teams whose players push, tackle, throw, kick and go to get the ball behind the opposition’s try line. Points may also be scored by kicking the ball with the goal posts for any conversion, penalty\nkick or drop goal.\nIdeal for all ages and abilities\nRugby could be played both socially and competitively. People of every age group and abilities can get involved with rugby through clinics and modified rules games.\nAlthough rugby is a message sport, the practice of tackling is usually only brought to appropriate age groups. Children and younger players are brought to rugby gradually, through more modified and non-contact versions from the sport.\nBenefits of Playing Rugby\nWhile playing rugby generally requires agility and strength, particular positions require specific innovative skills such as jumping and precision kicking.\nRugby involves sprinting, tackling, pushing and kicking. Health advantages include:\n- Cardiovascular fitness and endurance\n- Strength in lower and upper body\n- Ball-handling and kicking skills.\nRugby also brings other benefits, for example:\n- Team skills\n- Social interaction\n- Starting out\nYou can play in a local club or look for a clinic for beginners. Regardless of what shape, size or age you’re, you’ll find a level of rugby that’s best for you.\nRugby is quite complex as well as you to learn many individual and team skills. The Australian Rugby Union believes that younger Rugby Union players ought to be introduced to the game through its Junior Player Pathway Program, which is made to introduce kids towards the skills and tactical concepts of rugby inside a safe and fun manner.\nFor kids the recommendation is a total of a minimum of 60 minutes of at least moderately intense exercise each day. At least twice per week this should include activities that leave high physical stresses around the bone and improve muscle strength and adaptability.\nThe Department of Health has additionally found that:\nPhysical activity includes a range of benefits during childhood, including healthy development and growth, maintenance of energy balance, psychological well-being and social interaction.\n- Exercise is a major factor in reducing the probability of coronary heart disease in men and ladies.\n- Inactive, unfit individuals have almost double the chance of dying from heart disease than more active, fit people.\n- Half an hour of at least moderately intense exercise at least five days every week significantly reduces the chance of cardiovascular disease.\nThere is a low risk of stroke by as much as three times for physically active older people compared with their sedentary counterparts\nGroup recreational sports and activities will probably have positive social and mood benefits.\nAs tackling is the primary defensive tactic, rugby players could be prone to injuries, including:\n- Shoulder joint sprains\n- Hamstring strains\n- Knee ligament injuries\n- Ankle sprains.\nYou are able to reduce your risk of injury when playing rugby by:\n- Starting to warm up and cooling down\n- Using protective gear\n- Developing your skills\n- Using correct technique, particularly during connection with other players\n- Enforcing and following game rules.\nPlaying fairly in rugby is not just important to help prevent injuries, but additionally to ensure you and your team mates benefit from the game. You can aid in increasing fair play in rugby by:\n- Not setting up with foul play, for example dangerous tackles\n- Being respectful for your team mates, the opposition and also the referees.\nThings to remember\n- In Australia, the codes of Rugby League and Rugby Union are played.\n- Rugby is greatly a contact sport and involves two teams whose players push, tackle, throw, kick and go to get the ball behind the aim posts.\n- There are many health advantages you can gain from playing rugby.\n- You are able to play at a local club or look for a clinic for beginners.\n- Communication skills', 'By William Heinz, MD\nFor many of us, playing baseball or softball is the first true sign of spring. Children and adults across the country anxiously anticipate the first chance to play catch, hit a few balls, or play pickle at the old ball field. While it may seem gentle when compared to some contact and collision sports, baseball can be a demanding sport on the body. Swinging bats, running the bases, and hurling balls at high speeds inevitably lead to some scrapes, bumps, and bruises along the way. Many of the accidental injuries that occur while playing baseball are just that, accidents — an errant pitch hitting a batter, turning an ankle on a base, or a grounder taking a bad hop.\nThese unfortunate events should be treated properly and immediately to minimize the players’ discomfort. (Think RICE: rest, ice, compression, and elevation.) There are, however, some injuries that can be avoided to keep you and your children in the game. These involve various muscle pulls, shoulder problems, and elbow sprains. The most common baseball injury involves the rotator cuff — a collection of four muscles surrounding the shoulder that functions to maintain correct biomechanics. Tendonitis (inflammation) of the rotator cuff occurs when the tendon is overused, often as a result of repetitive overhand throwing and underdeveloped muscular strength. Pitchers and catchers are most susceptible to rotator cuff injuries because of the amount of throwing involved in those positions, but outfielders and other players also can be affected.\nPlan and Prepare\nTo prevent these injuries, all players are encouraged to develop a regimen of warm ups and stretching before throwing as well as proper throwing mechanics. Unfortunately, because children are often less aware of their physical limitations and sometimes put increased pressure on themselves, it is critical that parents and coaches pay close attention to their children’s play and be aware when their performance may have changed for the worse. For example, a pitcher who throws in control for the first few innings and then starts to throw wild pitches may actually be showing signs of fatigue or early injury to the rotator cuff. To avoid potential injury, this child should be removed from the game as performance begins to deteriorate.\nDuring the game, players also are encouraged to look after themselves by observing the following habits:\n• Stay warm: Keep a jacket on between innings.\n• Stay loose: Jog out to your position on the field at the change of innings.\n• Stay in the game: Keep moving between pitches.\nIf a shoulder, elbow, or hamstring begins to hurt, it is important to talk to your family doctor or sports medicine specialist to properly diagnose the problem. They will help develop a plan for resting and then strengthening the trouble spot. For easy reference, I have provided a few Web resources that describe some simple, effective strength exercises specifically targeting the rotator cuff and elbow. While lifting heavy weights will strengthen the large muscles in your body, the only way to strengthen the underlying tendons is through these very specific exercises that target the smaller muscles of the rotator cuff. Often, the only resistance needed is a piece of elastic tubing.\nThe USA Baseball Medical & Safety Advisory Committee recommends that the first pitch introduced to Little Leaguers should be the fast ball at 8 years old, followed by the change-up at 10, the curve at 14, the knuckle ball at 15, and the slider and fork ball at 16. Following these guidelines will allow the arm muscles to develop properly to meet the physical demands of each pitch and avoid “Little League Elbow,” a chronic inflammation of the growth plate in the elbow joint. It is also important to note that throwing fast or far is not purely a result of arm strength. Velocity comes from developing good mechanics and strengthening of the trunk, legs, and hips. The stronger you can make these parts of your body, the less stress you will put on your arm. Lastly, although it may seem like many of the players we see take the field at Hadlock or Fenway simply jump off the bus and hit the field ready to go, nothing could be further from the truth. Professional baseball players often reach the park four to five hours before game time and have done two hours of warm ups and stretching before even taking batting practice. Take a page out of their book and give yourself enough time to warm up.\nWilliam Heinz, MD, specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of sports-related musculoskeletal injuries.

63	How do ancient Greek doctors and modern practitioners compare on patient empowerment?	Both ancient Greek doctors and modern practitioners emphasize empowerment, though with different terminology. Ancient Greeks focused on 'self-sufficiency' and autonomy through health education and supportive environments, while modern practitioners promote empowerment to develop self-efficacy and combat stigma discrimination.

The theoretical framework for such a strategy stems from the development of the new “biopsychosocial” model for health and disease, which questions the dominance of the biomedical model, by putting emphasis on the role of the environment and of human behavior and on the biological, psychological and social dimensions of both positive and negative health.\nHowever, despite the commonly held assumption that such basic concepts are recent in origin, they actually have their roots in ancient civilizations, particularly in classical Greece. The ancient Greeks understood that good health was tied to physical and social environments as well as to human behavior. They defined health as a state of dynamic equilibrium between the internal and external environment. In addition, they considered the physical and social determinants of health, they empowered individuals and communities through new democratic and participatory institutions and placed emphasis on health education and skill development. They also recognized the importance of supportive environments and healthy public policy and reoriented medicine towards a more naturalistic and humanistic perspective.\nNEW IDEAS IN AN ANCIENT WORLD\nThe Greeks were the first to break with the metaphysical/supernatural conceptions of health and disease that had previously dominated human societies, seeking out answers in the physical world rather than in the actions of invisible forces.\nAristotle (384–322 BC), the son of a physician, questioning Plato’s transcendental ideas, called for the systematic observation of nature. The mythical world was replaced by one forged through the power of independent human intellect, a world which demanded that reality be explained through natural causes.\nEARLY EXPLANATIONS FOR HEALTH AND DISEASE: PYTHAGORAS, SOCRATES AND PLATO\nThe ancient Greeks’ understanding of health and disease was based on the theory of the four “humors” or fluids (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile), which in turn is premised on the theory of the four elements (fire, earth, water, air) and their four corresponding qualities (hot, dry, humid, cold). The Pythagoreans maintained that health is a condition of harmony and the perfect equilibrium of the fluids. Illness results when this balance is upset; thus, the important thing for maintaining health is to practice a way of life that allows for minimum disturbances to occur in the body. Since this balance can easily be disrupted by external factors, efforts are concentrated on regulating the human body’s physical and nutritional conditions.\nThe Greek word “hygieia” describes a condition of completeness and contentment. A healthy body is a well-balanced body – one that exists in harmony with cosmic laws and order.\nTHE TEACHINGS OF HIPPOCRATES\nHealth theories were elaborated in greater detail in the work of the ancient physician Hippocrates (ca. 460–370 BC). Unfortunately, little biographical information can be confirmed about this important figure. The 60 or so works comprising his corpus were probably written by a variety of authors, including both Hippocrates himself and his disciples, who together developed the starting point of medical science. According to the text entitled “On Airs, Waters and Places,” a groundbreaking achievement and the Hippocratic school’s most important contribution to medical science, health is similarly defined on the basis of an equilibrium, achieved between environmental forces on the one hand (wind, temperature, water, ground, food) and individual habits on the other (diet, alcohol, sexual behavior, work and leisure). The “internal” equilibrium of the four bodily fluids depends on the “external” equilibrium between a person and his/her environment.\nThe pathogenic process, according to the Hippocratics, results from the overturning of equilibrium and the predominance of one of the four fluids, thus leading to disease.\nThe Hippocratic physician who came to attend to a town’s population had to consider not only the season, the winds, the water people used and the geography of the place, but also the way people lived: did they drink a lot of wine, eat well, exercise, get adequate rest and work hard? The ancients stressed that good diet was crucial to health. The Greek word diaita, however, meant more than food and drink: diatetica (dietetics), the cornerstone of the healing art, involved an entire lifestyle.\nThe Hippocratics posited a natural theory for the cause of illness. In the case of male impotence among the Scythians, for example, Hippocrates made certain observations that were connected to factors such as horse riding, rheumatism, physical tiredness, weather conditions, ground conditions, and dietary practices.\nEMPOWERMENT AND EDUCATION FOR BETTER HEALTH\nToday’s Ottawa Charter proclaims that a key factor for the achievement of skills and community development is the empowerment of people – both as individuals and in communities – which is achieved mainly through health education and supportive environments. Although the term “empowerment” is not mentioned in ancient Greek philosophy and medicine, the Greek intellect in general was very much centered around the individual’s emancipation from the clutches of ignorance and superstition, leading people towards “self-sufficiency” – which, as a concept, is very close to contemporary ideas of empowerment.\nThe philosopher Protagoras (ca. 490–420 BC) defined “self-sufficiency” as a state of being in which one is not dependent on others. Pythagoras’ followers likewise placed an emphasis on self-maintained hygiene – the well-known “Pythagorean way of life.” Health was a condition of perfect equilibrium achieved by practicing self-control, moderation and calmness. The use of diet, gymnastics and even music were directed to the goal of restoring health when it had been “upset.” Thus, for someone to live “as he should,” systematic preparatory education was needed. Later, Aristippus (ca. 435–356 BC), a student of Socrates, drawing on the principle of self-sufficiency, advanced a theory and practice of life according to which our single aim is to enjoy life as much as possible – provided, however, that we are in control of both ourselves and circumstance at all times. It was only in this broad 5th–4th-century BC philosophical context that ancient “health education” could emerge.\n“Isonomy (equality of rights) positively affects not only citizens’ health but also democracy. In contrast, monarchy, a system of governance based on the rule of one, gives birth to disease.”\nHEALTH EFFECTS OF PHYSICAL, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS\nThe Hippocratics recognized “endemic” diseases – those always present in a given population – and “epidemic” diseases – those not always present but occurring in greater frequency at certain times. Both terms are still widely used today. (The text “On Airs, Waters and Places” attempts to identify the factors behind local endemicity by addressing climate as well as the quality of the soil, water, way of life and nutrition.) Hippocratic physicians also paid attention to the location of an individual’s dwelling, the winds to which it was exposed and how near it was to rivers, swamps or the seashore.\nWinds and their influence on health held particular interest for the Hippocratics: “Cities which are faced towards the sunrise are healthier than those which are faced towards the North and … warm winds.” Hippocratic writings go even further, recognizing the importance of the social and political environment as well, and often referring to the “health” of the polis. With the birth of democracy in ancient Greece came a departure from the heteronomous status quo and a movement towards autonomy. Athenians reformed their political system to increase the possibility of real participation of the people in the exercise of power, in a state of autonomy in which the political community created its own laws. Autonomy precludes the idea of an extra-social source of laws and institutions. This is the highest kratos (strength) that exists in a society: the giving of ourselves to the laws and institutions under which we live and the government that determines our direction. Society is never just a simple synthesis or summation of persons, since people are to some extent created by their society. Therefore, an autonomous society means ipso facto autonomous persons, which in turn means an empowered society and empowered persons. The notion of empowerment is thus related not only to self-sufficiency, but also to autonomy.\nEven before the flourishing of Greek democracy, however, social conditions had already been considered to affect health. The philosopher and medical theorist Alcmaeon (born ca. 510 BC) does not hesitate to define health in terms borrowed from the political vocabulary of his time. He asserts health is isonomy, the equality of rights, the total balance of forces – “fluids, dry, bitter and sweet” – active in the human body. Isonomy positively affects not only citizens’ health but also democracy. In contrast, monarchy, a system of governance based on the rule of one, gives birth to disease. It destroys the polis (city) by imposing the rule of a single element on the others, thus destroying isonomy.\nTHE RISE OF NATURALISTIC AND HUMANISTIC MEDICINE\nLittle is known of Greek medicine before the testimony of written texts in the 5th century BC, but it can be assumed that Ancient Greece, like many other places in prehistory, possessed folk healers, priest healers and chief tribunes employing divination and drugs. In Homer’s Iliad, Apollo appears as the god of healing. Various other gods and heroes were also identified with health and disease, the most predominant being Asclepius, whom Homer portrays simply as a tribal chief and a skilled healer of wounds. Physicians were apparently little appreciated in Homeric times, perceived merely as lowly craftsmen of inferior standing. Physicians are classed in Homeric epic with other itinerant laborers while Asclepius is not even recognized as a son of Apollo. Only with Hesiod and other authors does Asclepius become the son of divine Apollo and thus a semi-god. This upgrading of his position signified an upgrading of medicine and, at the same time, a reorientation of medical care.\nScholars attribute Asclepius’ rapid ascendancy, after ca. 700 BC, to his popularity among the poor and lower classes, who saw him as a god particularly interested in their welfare, a lover of all people regardless of station. Physicians who followed Asclepius as the god of health and medicine had a clear obligation to treat the rich and the poor alike.\nThe ensuing rise of Hippocratic teachings represented a decisive step in refounding medicine on a quite different basis: as a healing system independent of the supernatural and built on natural philosophy. This separation of medicine from religion is indicative of the openness of ancient Greek intellectual activity. Hippocratic medicine was not only an appeal to reason, however, and thus an early scientific endeavor; it was also a patient-centered rather than disease-oriented approach, concerned more with observation and experience than with abstractions.\nAncient medicine shared close ties with ethics – the philosophical study of morality. Today, biomedical ethics include four key principles – autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice – considered to be of equal weight or priority in any particular situation. Autonomy and justice were also key principles in ancient Greek medicine. In healthcare, autonomy involves respect for clients’ rights to make decisions about and for themselves and their care. Beneficence and nonmaleficence are age-old requirements of the Hippocratic Oath, stipulating that health professionals to “do good” and “do no harm.”\nHippocratic doctors took care to consider their patients’ social circumstances and potential limitations when administering advice and guidance. To care for the poor and for wounded warriors, the institution of “public doctors” was established in ancient Greece. In Athens, such doctors were selected by the popular assembly. The city paid for their salaries and medicines through a special public taxation.\nPlato, the earliest writer to mention Hippocrates and his theories in his dialogue Timaeus, taught that morality was not simply a matter of education. Since the mind is influenced by the body, the doctor has a part to play in teaching virtue. Plato’s Timaeus went on to become a highly influential text, linking medicine and philosophy, health and politics. Nowadays, it also reminds us of the contemporary conception of sociopolitical determinants in health.\nA MEDICAL REVOLUTION\nThe innovative ideas of the ancient Greeks, from the 7th to 4th centuries BC, laid the foundations for later Western thought and achievement in many areas of learning including medicine. Pioneering Greek philosophers fashioned the basic concepts underlying philosophical and scientific inquiry. Since these pursuits were originally interwoven, the discursive framework in which they developed fostered the emergence of core natural science concepts, out of which European philosophy and science later evolved. The Hippocratic tradition in particular, with its definition of health as a state of balance between internal and external environment, brought a revolution in the concepts of health and disease and in medical practices. The naturalistic approach of the Hippocratics, today held up as a precious heritage, can be characterized by its spontaneity, scientific value and humanistic attitude. In the end, Hippocrates and his followers have transformed medical thought.\nIn Western civilization, health continues to be considered a state of perfect balance. The difference between ancient and modern concepts has more to do with what the human body is comprised of. As Henry Sigerist writes, “we know today that the human organism is made of cells and intercellular substances that are kept alive and function because of chemical and physical forces in a state of dynamic equilibrium defined by the internal and external environment.” Ancient Greek medicine’s naturalistic foundations are of fundamental importance to the development of modern health science. Aristotle put forward very influential views on the constitution of life and health, and his discussions of physiology have long intrigued doctors and philosophers alike.\nToday, health promotion and educational approaches that emphasize correct diet and physical exercise can clearly be traced back to the ancient Greeks, whose health education, based on a holistic perception of health, incorporated ideas regarding both the physical and social environment and laid the foundations for the concept of health promotion in the modern era.\nThe institution of ancient Athenian democracy, despite its tolerance of slavery and discrimination against women, reflected a supportive social environment for health and the promotion of healthy attitudes and behaviors.\nIn large part based on the health-related legacy and principles of ancient Greece, medicine today is undergoing a reorientation as it seeks to provide more humane, fair and efficient health services. “Public doctors” to care for the poor, the Hippocratic oath’s humanitarian approach towards patients and the development of patient-friendly, easily accessible healthcare units all fall within the basic values and goals of any contemporary healthcare system that strives to restore a more humanitarian and equalitarian spirit in contemporary medicine.\n* Yannis Tountas is Professor of Social and Preventive Medicine in the Medical School University of Athens.\n“Hippocratic doctors took care to consider their patients’ social circumstances and potential limitations when administering advice and guidance.”']	['<urn:uuid:c2524c7a-f868-4529-ac9c-6361e8e5cd6d>', '<urn:uuid:0866573b-8812-4a91-a20e-fb38e1681b05>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	12	38	2982
64	I want to get my martial arts uniform embroidered with my name in Japanese - can I use regular Chinese characters (kanji) for this, or should I use a different writing system?	For foreign names on martial arts equipment, using katakana is the most appropriate choice rather than kanji. While some Westerners prefer kanji (through a method called Ateji), this can be confusing for Japanese readers since kanji characters have multiple possible readings and meanings. Katakana is specifically designed for transcribing foreign words and names, providing a more clear and accurate phonetic representation. When embroidering foreign names in Japan, katakana is the standard approach as it allows Japanese people to read and pronounce the name more easily. Even when transcribing with katakana, the process must consider the actual pronunciation of the name in its original language, not just its spelling, to ensure proper representation in Japanese.	"['Embroideries on Martial Arts Equipment\nEmbroidery Workshop & Translation Practices at Seido\nHaving one’s training’s cloths embroidered is the most common thing in Japan. However, westerners often know just little about this topic and some struggle with making the right choice. That is why in this article we are going to talk about embroidery content, show some common mistakes and give advice on how to avoid them and last but not least, explain how we make them at Seido.\n§ Why Embroideries?\nFirst of all: How come that we embroider our names on our Aikido equipment? Originally, it is a sign of modesty, meaning that you do not consider yourself as important enough to be remembered by the teacher! If you have at least one embroidery on your cloth, the teacher can always call you by your name as soon as he wants to refer to you. Especially at a place like the Hombu Dojo with several hundred practitioners, it is important and even considered as impolite, if you join a class without embroidered clothing.\nAn eyewitness recently told me, that in such a case, one of the teachers (I will not mention his name) would even go as far as to write your name with a permanent ugly marker on the jacket of your sleeve, right during the class.\n§ Embroidery Content\nWith this background, it is obvious now, that the embroidery content should consist of nothing else but your name and possibly also the school or club name you are attached to or, on belts for example, the martial art you practice at an easily visible place. Right hip on the Hakama and left sleeve of the jacket is the classic option. Japanese generally use – often even when talking to close friends – only their family name but almost never their first name.\nHowever, westerners rather embroider their first name – and in Japan, you are expected to do so as foreigner. The reason is quite simple. First, the shorter the embroidery the easier it is understood by Japanese, and second, Japanese are used to hear foreigner names (TV shows, drama, English classes at school, etc.) so it’s easier for them to read a previously heard first name than a less common family name. Anyways, when practicing in Japan, you will be called by the name embroidered on your cloths, or eventually a diminutive/nickname if your name is too complicated to pronunce for a Japanese.\nOutside of Japan, however, embroideries loose the simply practical aspect– as most westerners actually cannot read it but nonetheless frequently embroider their cloths in Japanese. It also looks like it is somehow “fancy” to opt not only for one’s name, but have another word or expression, a nickname, even a poem written on the equipment. It is quite unusual in Aikido, but actually not uncommon in Karate or Judo to see for example the founders words or a very important principle of the art/Dojo embroidered. However, in such a case the content should be on second thought, and rather not like this:\nOk, let’s admit it, we sometimes are little amused when we get such orders. But do not forget that there are not only Japanese but also other practitioners who can read Japanese and such an embroidery can be seen as somewhere between simply funny, puzzling or ridiculous.\nIn addition, there is actually one no-go, that you should avoid: adding “Sensei” to your name. No matter what rank they are, Japanese never refer to themselves as “Sensei”. For those who do not know, this expression is used as honorific title when you talk about or directly address teachers for example or other people who have achieved a certain level or mastery in a certain field. It is added after and not – as westerners by mistake often do – before the name.\nIt is “Miyamoto Shihan”, “Miyamoto Sensei”, or “Miyamoto-dono” in specific circunstances (when it’s a teacher you know, you can skip the name and use only “Sensei”, but never “Sensei Miyamoto” or “Shihan Miyamoto”).\nTherefore, you should not add “Sensei” (or also “Shihan”, or the honorific suffixes “-san/-sama” ) as embroidery content, even if the item is a gift for your teacher. You’d rather add his title on a note you’ll give him with the present.\n§ Transcription of Foreign Names\nThere are actually several ways to have your name written in Japanese, let me introduce the two most common ones.\nKanji & Ateji, when westerners get it wrong:\nMost westerners like the Japanese Kanji, the logographic characters based on the Chinese writing. So there is a technique called Ateji, a way of writing every non-Japanese word – like foreign names – using Kanji representing it phonetically.\nIndeed, this may look really nice, at least exotic at first sight, but the actual meaning of the characters is in second place. And this is where it gets complicated. If for example you have the syllable “so” in your name, you could already choose from about 30 different Kanji – all representing this, but often not exclusively this – sound.\nOr in other words, there are countless possibilities to write a name using Kanji. And, because almost all Kanji have several different pronunciations, countless possibilities to read it “wrongly”. For a “well made” Ateji, one would as far as possible, only choose Kanji that have only one reading and hence choose their phonetic rather than semantic qualities. This was the only way foreign words, religious expressions in Sanskrit or from the 16th century onwards Portuguese and later Dutch words etc, could be written in Japanese.\nFor example “France” became: 仏蘭西 read “Fu-Ran-Su”, using the Kanji for “Buddha – Orchid – West”. In short: Although pretty, using Ateji usually is confusing to people who can read Japanese and therefore not the best solution for an embroidery.\nKatakana, the right way to do it:\nThe less pretty but more adequate choice for foreign name transcription would be to use the syllabary called Katakana. This writing system consists of 48 simplified characters (coming from Kanji parts) that are in the present basically used to transcribe loanwords or other foreign language words. Hence, a foreign word is written by choosing the phonetically closest syllables existing.\nWith this background, you may start to guess the complexity when it comes to translate your name for your embroidery and especially why we do not offer Ateji. No matter if Ateji or Katakana, the transcription is always based on the pronunciation, ignoring the actual spelling. And the pronunciation especially of a given names depend on the language, the country and maybe even the region you live in (as well as your Gender in some languages). A very common name like “David” for example exists in most western countries but its pronunciation, and therefore the Japanese transcription, varies.\nBecause it can take quite some time to figure out a proper translation that takes all these variables into account we do not offer this service before we get your order. The good thing is, that we have staff speaking Japanese, French, English, German, Portuguese, Arabic and a little Spanish, so we get quite far and with the help of the internet we usually get the pronunciation of your name right.\nAnd when we say “internet”, we are not using Google Translate. That is not trustworthy at all for Japanese. The better solution is to check on Wikipedia. You can also give it a shot yourself and search for a famous person whose name is pronounced like yours and check if there is a Japanese translation of this page. These translations are usually correct, the more resent the better (translation made before the globalization era are, often, anglicized and simplified). There are also some websites with lists of names transcribed in Japanese, sorted by language or country (not always accurate though).\nAnyways, it is always helpful if you give us some details, especially if you already know that your name is pronounced wrongly rather frequently or if your name is pronounced in another language than spoken in the country you are living in.\nAnd there is another difficulty, even knowing the correct pronunciation, there is often not just one correct transcription.\n“David” – transcribed based on an English pronunciation – could be written デイビット (De-i-bi-tto) or デビット (De-bi-tto) or also デヴィット (De-vi-tto), to only show 3 examples. And that is why we ask you to attach a picture if you already have an embroidery, so you do not end up having different transcriptions on your equipment.\nWe also do our best by keeping (almost) every file of every embroidery we have made during the last few years. (And this also goes for all engravings! Of course, they have to match your embroideries, too.) But we need at least to know from you, if you have already ordered an embroidery/engraving or not.\nMaybe you understand now, why shops in Japan often make wrong transcriptions or at least only based on an English pronunciation. No matter how much you care, you can easily end up with unsatisfied customers. And why are we still offering this service, for free, despite all the trouble and the time this takes to do it right? Because as foreigners ourselves, and with you, featuring the mentioned information we need, we are perfectly able to do a good job!\n§ Quality Embroideries: A Question of Balance\nLet’s have a look now at how an embroidery is made on a technical level. Once we have decided on how to write your name in Japanese, we use a graphic program to create the file for your embroidery, adapting the size depending on the content, rearranging the letters and also changing the basic layout if you wish something special – no problem.\nFrom there, it looks rather simple: put the fabric into the embroidery machine and hit the start button. But of course, there is a bit more to it if you want to end up with a high quality embroidery that lasts.\nThe tension of the threads and the whole machine, both are actually quite fragile, reacting to the thickness and quality of the fabric that is embroidered, as well as to temperature or humidity changes. Using a bobbin that, depending on the amount of thread on it, is 1-2 grams heavier than the one used for the previous embroidery can change everything. Or the belts, varying in their thickness, the fabrics in their surface, we have to be aware of all of it. It is crucial to be constantly adapting all the settings and taking good care of the machine in general to get good results. And yes, it happens that something goes wrong and a product down the drain.\nCheck out our embroidery workshop presentation on Youtube\nSpecific case of the belts: Integrated and Non-Integrated Embroideries\nFor belt embroideries there are two types of embroideries available: Integrated and non-integrated embroideries.\nA non-integrated embroidery means that you take a finished belt and simply add an embroidery on top of it. It is easy and quick to achieve, the embroidery visible on both sides, exactly as for a Dogi or Hakama.\nAn integrated embroidery means that you first embroidery the fabric used for the outer layer of the belt and afterwards sew the belt. The advantage of this is that because the lines of stitchings are sewn on top of it, it lasts longer and is invisible on the back side of the belt, when it is finished.\nHowever, it is extremely difficult to achieve a good result in terms of the orientation. To perfectly center an embroidery that has a length of about 16-20 cm – quite common for foreign names, is almost impossible. The workshop we chose to handle this, is by far the best in Japan we have ever worked with (We’ve worked with half a dozen); they do an incredibly good job!\nConsidering these facts, resulting in a custom made and not just customized product, also makes it a big deal more expensive. But in my opinion it is all worth it, opting for an integrated embroidery for your black belt, that you will keep for many years of practice.\n§ And Finally\nSome facts now.\nThe name David (デビット) written in Katakana on the left sleeve of a jacket, at a standard size of 2.7 cm per character, consists of about 1500 stitches and roughly takes 3~4 min to embroider.\nConsidering the density of the stitchings needed to embroider over a whole surface, a logo for example of the size of about 7×7 cm consisting of about 25000 stitches can easily take about 30 min.\n- The more often you make the machine cut the thread during the embroidery and therefore slowing down, the more time it takes. But the more often you do that, the better the quality and the prettier the result.\n- Removing an embroidery without any damage is even harder than making the embroidery. It’s a skill that only one here really masters.\n- Embroideries are charged by character in Japan. The average cost is 300~500 YEN (tax free) per character, which makes our embroideries far more affordable than when ordered at an embroidery workshop in Japan (due to the average length of foreigners names). And we’re using the exact same machines, of course.\n- Hand guided embroideries have almost disapeared, unfortunately. High quality embroidery fonts, such as those we use, composed of more than 5,000 letters, are all handwritten to offer a render similar to Japanese hand guided embroidery and calligraphy. (Cheap windows fonts can be used and are used by some budo equipment companies, but the quality is far inferior)\n- And by the way, working as a team, in the same building where our stock and offices are, we are fast! We know everyones strength, and when the schedule is tight, the workflow and coordination/timing have to be perfect.\n- Even our boss can jump in to get your embroidery done the same day if necessary! Not everyone can do everything, but we push each other to learn as much as possible in as many fields as possible!\n§ Other ressources\n- You’ll find some additionnal details and more pictures on our page “How to Choose your Japanese Embroidery”\n- Our embroidery machine maker website Barudan America\nWikipedia has quite a nice set of articles about Japanese language.', 'Japanese/Japanese writing system\nThe Japanese language uses three different systems for writing. There are two syllabaries—hiragana and katakana—which have characters for each basic mora (syllable.) Along with the syllabaries, there are also kanji, which is a writing system based on Chinese characters. However, kanji have changed since their adoption, so it would not be recommended to learn both Chinese and Japanese writing at the same time.\nKanji[edit | edit source]\nThe kanji are logograms (pictures representing words), or symbols, that each represent a morpheme (words or parts of words.) Usually, each kanji represents a native Japanese morpheme as well as a loaned Chinese morpheme. This means that each kanji usually has two or more different pronunciations. The different pronunciations of a particular\nA 漢字 usually has two types of readings:\n音読み readings are approximations of the Chinese pronunciations of that particular 漢字. This reading is mostly used for multi-kanji compound words, except for peoples\' surnames where 訓読み-reading is used. A kanji may have multiple 音読み. Some kanji are of Japanese origin and thus do not have on-reading. 訓読み readings are the native Japanese sound(s) associated with that 漢字. There can be multiple or no kun readings for the same kanji.\nAlthough there are over 50,000 漢字, the Japanese government has approved 1,945 so-called “daily use” 漢字, known as\nKana[edit | edit source]\nWhile Chinese characters are useful for writing a language with so many homophones, the inflections of the Japanese language make it necessary to have a phonetic script to indicate the inflection. A set of Chinese characters, the man\'yōgana, were used to represent pronunciation and write words that lacked Chinese characters. Around 800 A.D. these had developed into the cursive hiragana script.\nThis method of writing was used primarily for poetry or by women, and did not gain recognition as an acceptable way to record historical records or scholarly works.\nAnother script, the katakana also developed from Chinese characters, some from the same source as the hiragana, but others from different ones. This explains the similarities between some hiragana and katakana, while others are completely different. The katakana is primarily used for foreign loan-words. In other words, the katakana syllabary can be said to be the Japanese writing equivalent of writing in italics.\nThe two are collectively known as the kana (\nPunctuation[edit | edit source]\nCommon punctuation marks are the comma ""、"" which connects two sentences, and the full stop ""。"" which indicates the end of a sentence. To separate words that the reader might not otherwise know how to read (most often in the case of foreign words written consecutively in katakana), a middle point ""・"" is used. Instead of quotation marks, the brackets ""「"" and ""」"" are used.\nExamples[edit | edit source]\n|「ウィキペディアは、オンライン百科事典である。」||(Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia.)|\n|「キャント・バイ・ミー・ラヴ」||(Can\'t buy me love) (Kyanto·bai·mī·ravu)|\nLatin alphabet[edit | edit source]\nThe Latin alphabet (ローマ字, rōmaji) is not part of the Japanese language but it is used as a fashionable way of writing words, mostly nouns such as the name of a company, business, sports team, etc. Rōmaji is also used for the transliteration of Japanese and to input Japanese text online and in word processors. There are two competing transliteration methods: the Kunrei-shiki developed by the Japanese government in the mid-20th century and taught in elementary school; and the more widely used Hepburn-shiki developed by Reverend James Curtis Hepburn in the late 19th century.\nStroke order[edit | edit source]\nJapanese characters were originally written by brush, and later by pen and pencil, so the stroke order is important. When writing by hand, and particularly in cursive or calligraphic styles, using proper stroke order is crucial. Additionally, some characters look very similar but are written differently. Students who practice both reading and writing can easily distinguish these characters, but students who only practice reading may find it difficult.\nThe East Asian Calligraphy wikibook has some material on stroke orders.\nMixed usage and notes of interest[edit | edit source]\nThere are instances where kanji, hiragana, and katakana may be replaced by another writing style. Frequently, words that have kanji are written in hiragana. Some kanji are simply rarely used but their reading is known. The swallow is called tsubame and has the kanji ""燕"", but since it is obscure, the word will generally be written out with hiragana: ""つばめ"".\nWhen writing for an audience that isn\'t expected to know certain kanji (such as in texts aimed at young people or kanji outside the standard set), their reading is often added on top of, or to the right of the characters, depending on whether they are written horizontally or vertically, respectively. This form of writing is called furigana (振り仮名) or yomigana (読み仮名).\nSince kanji can have several different readings, it may not be straightforward to determine how to read a certain word. This problem is particularly pronounced in place names where readings may be highly irregular and archaic.\nThough katakana are principally used for loan words from other languages, it can be used for stylistic purposes. Either to highlight a certain word, or give it a different feel (e.g. make it look more hip). Furthermore, since some personal names don\'t have kanji, but are written in hiragana, personal name readings are generally written in katakana to indicate that these are not the name itself, but simply the pronunciation.\nAteji[edit | edit source]\nThe word ""club"", as it is borrowed from English, will typically be written in katakana as クラブ; however, the kanji 倶楽部 kurabu will also sometimes be used; this use of kanji for phonetic value is called 当て字 ateji. Other times, typically in older texts, grammatical particles are also written in kanji, as in 東京迄行く Tokyo made iku ([I] go to Tokyo), where まで made (to/till) is written in kanji (迄) instead of hiragana.\nNumerals[edit | edit source]\nThe Arabic numerals, called Arabia sūji (アラビア数字) or san\'yō sūji (算用数字) in Japanese, are used in most circumstances (e.g. telephone numbers, pricing, zip codes, speed limit signs and percentages). Kanji numerals can still be found, however, in more traditional situations (e.g. on some restaurant menus, formal invitations and tomb stones).\n|一||二||三||四||五||六||七||八||九||零 or 〇|\nVertical and horizontal writing, and page order[edit | edit source]\nTraditionally, Japanese is written in a format called 縦書き tategaki, or vertical writing. In this format, the characters are written in columns going from top to bottom. The columns are ordered from right to left, so at the bottom of each column the reader returns to the top of the next column on the left of the preceding one. This copies the column order of Chinese.\nModern Japanese also uses another writing format, called 横書き yokogaki, or horizontal writing. This writing format is identical to that of European languages such as English, with characters arranged in rows which are read from left to right, with successive rows going downwards.\nThere are no set rules for when each form has to be used, but usage tends to depend on the medium, genre, and subject. Tategaki is generally used to write essays, novels, poetry, newspapers, comics, and Japanese dictionaries. Yokogaki is generally used to write e-mails, how-to books, and scientific and mathematical writing (mathematical formulas are read from left to right, as in English).\nMaterials written in tategaki are bound on the right, with the reader reading from right to left and thus turning the pages from left to right to progress through the material. Materials written with yokogaki are bound on the left and the pages are turned from right to left, as in English.\nBackground reading[edit | edit source]\n- Okurigana Kana used as suffixes to kanji stems for verb conjugations. Historically, katakana was used. Nowadays, hiragana is used.\n- Man\'yōgana Kanji used for their phonetic value to write Japanese, especially for poetry.\n- Kana The simplification of Man\'yougana into Katakana and Hiragana\n- Katakana Angular script simplified down to constituent elements from kanji by monastary students. Historically used as okurigana by the educated and government. Nowadays used mainly for writing foreign words.\n- Hiragana Cursive script historically used for informal writing and literature. It became popular among women since they were denied higher education. Hence it also became known as 女手(おんなで) ""onnade"" (female hand -> women\'s writing). Nowadays, it has replaced katakana as okurigana and for writing native japanese words.\n- Hentaigana These are the remaining variants of hiragana that were not accepted as part of the standardized hiragana syllabary.\n- Iroha poem This famous poem is written using each mora (syllable) just once. It became the system used to organize the kana syllabary prior to reforms in the 19th century Meiji period, when it became reorganized into its current arrangement. (""n"" was not part of the syllabary at the time. It was added later, and interestingly it\'s actually a hentaigana for ""mu"")\n- Kana The simplification of Man\'yougana into Katakana and Hiragana\n- Rōmaji Roman characters (including Arabic numerals) There are three different systems.']"	['<urn:uuid:9bb50e25-03d6-4b39-b31f-005d56a70126>', '<urn:uuid:26df3b8b-37e9-4a4f-890b-1f7a12d115c4>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	32	114	3883
65	predator evasion techniques color camouflage adaptations spiders sea turtles night protection mechanisms	Spiders and sea turtles employ different techniques for predator evasion, particularly regarding color and nighttime protection. Spiders have evolved various camouflage mechanisms - some can change their color to match their surroundings, while others mimic inedible insects, floral stamens, or birds' droppings. Some spiders like Argyope and Nephila display warning colors, and Gasteracantha imitates woody knots. For sea turtles, nighttime protection is crucial during nesting season, with specific adaptations to darkness - they rely on the reflection of the moon and stars on water for navigation. This is so important that there are regulations requiring beachfront lights to be turned off by 10 p.m. and only red flashlights are allowed to avoid turtle disorientation.	"[""(Last Updated on : 21/08/2014)\nSpiders possess a body which consists of cephalothorax (head and thoraxunited) and an abdomen, separated by a waist. The head carries eight simple eyes and along the front margin a pair each of jaws (chelicerae) with foldable poison fangs and pedipalps which are six-jointed. On either side of the thorax there are four seven-jointed legs, the size and disposition of which vary greatly in different genera. At the hind end of the abdomen are four or six spinning organs. The spider has an alimentary canal with a sucking stomach. The heart is tubular. Respiration is by air tubes or book-lungs.\nThe peculiarity of spiders is their ability to spin. Silk is a part and parcel of their life. They are born in silk, their webs and cocoons are of silk, they capture their prey with silk and they dangle and travel by silk threads. All spiders therefore are born with spinning organs and silk glands. The spinning organs are the four or six teat-like spinnerets at the hind end of their body. Each teat is not a single tap but carries numerous apertures connected with the various silk glands within. The spider can draw silk from the glands in whatever quantity or quality is required for a particular work. The animal by holding the spinnerets together can join threads, or by holding the tips a little apart manufacture broad bands of silk for swathing struggling victims. Besides the spinnerets, additional spinning organs such as a sieve-plate under the belly (cribellum) or a comb of hairs along one pair of legs (calamistrum), are possessed by some spiders )i.e. Eresids).\nNature has provided a spider with silk glands capable of yielding silk for as long as it lives. Within the glands the silk is in a fluid condition. It is drawn and emitted out in fine streams through the minute taplets or apertures. The fluid silk solidifies on coming into contact with air. The spider has no power to shoot out silk to any distance. After emitting a drop of liquid silk the spider pulls it with its spinnerets to make it into a thread. In paying out threads to the air the breeze serves as the pulling force. The sphincters of the spinnerets are weak and the escape of silk from its belly is not rigidly controlled by the spider. Taking advantage of this fact naturalists have been able to draw, by winding, more than hundred metres of thread from a single spider in one hour.\nThe spinning powers of spiders vary greatly. It is in Obr-Weavers that we find the maximum number and variety of silk glands. The typical orb-weaver - Araneus - has six hundred silk glands of five different sets occupying the entire floor area of her belly. Each set has a technical name and is used for a particular work. Thus the silk from the ambullaceal set is used for boundary lines and spokes, aggregate for viscid spirals, tubuliform for cocoons, aciniform for anchoring and piriform for winding and enwrapping prey.\nSpiders are widely distributed throughout temperate and tropical regions. They are ubiquitous and thrive in all environments. They vary greatly in size, shape and habits. There are Sedentary and Roving spiders. The Sedentary spiders include; Orb-weavers (Argyopids), Irregular Line Web-weavers (Pholcids, Theridiids etc.), Nest-weavers (Eresids), Water spiders (Lycosids). The Roving spiders include; Hunters (Lycosids, Sparassids, Oxyopids, Thomisids, etc.), Jumpers (Attids).\nMost of the sedentary and roving spiders are solitary. Some Theridiids, Pholcids and line-weavers are gregarious, i.e. they build their independent webs contiguous to each other. A few of them weave webs generally on the periphery of an Argyopid web and poach the insects caught in its snare and even attack and eat the Argyopid. The only truly social spiders are the Eresids which build a huge common nest and live inside it.\nAll spiders feed chiefly on insects. Web-weavers eat the insects caught in their snares. Underground tube dwellers prey on insects coming near prey and eat them. Spiders are gluttons. They can eat a large number of insects at a time. They can also starve for a long period - some for nearly eighteen months. In the spider kingdom females are dominant. Males are generally pygmies and dull-coloured. In general such as Argyope and Nephila the disparity is very great. A female Nephila is in length twenty times and in weight thousand times the male. The mature males of web-weavers are nomadic, wandering in search of females. During the mating season they appear in large numbers along the borders of female webs, sometimes weaving rudimentary webs. Their only mission is to fertilize the female - and die during or soon after mating. In Nephila and allied genera the mating operation is fraught with considerable danger to the males. If the female is hungry even the most cautious approach of the male will result in his being eaten. If she is not hungry she may accept him but if he is not quick in escaping she is sure to devour him. The life of the males therefore is generally short. Females live longer - they have to lay eggs, protect them and nurse the spiderlings until the young can live by themselves.\nThe pregnant female weaves a silk matlet, lays her eggs on it and winds it into a cocoon. The size, shape and colour of cocoons differ in different genera. Cocoons of garden Spiders are nearly spherical, yellow or white and attached to one side of their webs. Cocoons of Cyrtophora, whose web resembles an umbrella, are ovoid and green, attached vertically above the web like a beaded chain. Lycosids and Pholcids have small globular cocoons which they carry by their spinnerets or jaws. The common Indian House Spider Heteropoda venatoria and other Sparassids have round, flat, disc-like cocoons which they carry beneath their belly. Others have cocoons of varying shapes which they conceal under patchy sheets in crevices of walls, bark of trees, axils of leaves, bunch of fruit, etc. A cocoon of Araneus contains six hundred eggs; of Argyope twelve hundred to two thousand; line-weavers 100 and Attids only two to four eggs.\nThe eggs hatch producing spiderlings. Fresh spiderlings cannot feed or spin. They become active only after one or two moults (casting of the skin). The mother spiders are ready to avoid food and risk their own lives to protect the eggs. Some even carry the spiderlings on their backs until the young ones are able to live independently. When once independent, each spiderling sets off by air into the unknown. This occurs in spring or early autumn when the wing is gentle. The spiderlings sit on any raised convenient spot with head lowered and abdomen raised. In this position they emit silk which becomes threads. As the threads begin to float in the air the spiderlings leave their holds, cling to the thread and sail in the air. Although the direction of their flight will be determined by the wind, the spiderlings can land where they choose by hauling in the threads and rolling them into a ball. By this 'gossamer' method spiderlings cross wide rivers and oceans and are carried to considerable heights. Aeroplanes frequently run into gossamer.\nScorpions, lizards, birds, frogs, toads, insectivorous mammals - all feed on spiders and their cocoons. Solitary wasps and ichneumon flies particularly hunt them and store them in their cellars for the sustenance of their young. Within houses their cobwebs are brushed away by housewives. Digging, ploughing and tree felling also destroy spiders.\nSedentary spiders have their webs, nests or tubes which adequately shelter them from their enemies, besides enabling them to catch their prey. Roving spiders have strong and nimble legs armed with sharp spines. Some can make long and sudden leaps. Others can move zigzag like flies or sideways like crabs. Some mimic inedible insects such as ants and ladybirds or floral stamens and birds' droppings. Some are coloured in harmony with their surroundings and some can change their colour to suit the environment. Some have long and cylindrical bodies and long, thin legs (Tetragnatha) which they can stretch far apart and remain concealed along twigs and leaf-blades. Argyope and Nephila have warning colours. Gasteracantha imitates woody knots. Pholcids oscillate their webs and make spasmodic up-and-down movements of their bodies so rapidly that enemies leave them alone. Some sham death when disturbed, drop down and scurry away unnoticed.\nGenerally speaking spiders are harmless to man except one or two species of the genus Poecilotheria. Spiders feed on mosquitoes, flies and cockroaches within the houses. Outside they are the principal agency that controls the bewildering multiplication of insects which destroy vegetation and crops."", 'Everything You Need to Know About Sea Turtle Nesting Season on Tybee Island\nDuring the day, the beach is filled with sunbathers, sand castles and sunshine, but at night, sea turtles make their way out of the Atlantic to begin nesting.\nSea turtle nesting season is a special time for Tybee Island. Loggerhead sea turtles and occasionally their cousins crawl onto our beaches to lay their precious eggs. We understand that nesting season is a fascinating experience, so we\'ve broken it down and compiled a list of everything you may need to know about turtle nesting season on Tybee Island.\nWHEN DOES SEA TURTLE NESTING BEGIN?\nNesting season begins May 1st and typically ends at the end of October. During this time, the program ""Lights Out on Tybee"" is in effect. To avoid turtle disorientation, please make sure to turn off beachfront lights by 10 p.m., avoid the use of cell phones and only use red flashlights on the beach.\nTurtle Tip: Create your own red light by using a red magic marker to color the tip of your flashlight. After turtle season, you can easily wipe it off and return to using your flashlight regularly.\nWHAT KIND OF SEA TURTLES NEST ON TYBEE ISLAND?\nLoggerheads are the most common sea turtles along the Georgia coast with rare appearances by green sea turtles, leatherbacks and Kemp Ridley turtles.\nWHEN DOES THE MOTHER LOGGERHEAD LAY THEIR EGGS?\nFemale loggerheads crawl out of the ocean at night to nest. They make their way up just past the high tide line and dig a deep round hole using their two rear flippers. The mother then lays her eggs in the hole and covers it back up with sand before leaving.\nTurtle Tip: Adult loggerheads weigh more than 200 pounds, which causes them to be slow moving making the entire nesting process over an hour long.\nHOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEIR NESTS ARE?\nEvery morning, DNR trained and permitted volunteers from the Tybee Sea Turtle Project walk the beach to look for new nests. They search for specific ""sea turtle crawls"", which are the tracks left by the mothers when searching for a spot. Once they find a nest, they rope it off and mark it, so people do not disturb it.\nTurtle Tip: Loggerhead sea turtles are endangered, and it is illegal to disturb their nests.\nHOW MANY EGGS DO THEY LAY?\nThey typically lay 80 to 120 ping pong-sized eggs.\nHOW LONG UNTIL THEY HATCH?\nThey typically incubate for 55 to 60 days before they hatch. They hatch in unison and make their way toward the water using the reflection of the moon and stars on the water for guidance.\nTurtle Tip: They crawl in groups for their safety to overwhelm waiting predators.\nDO THE MOTHERS OR FATHERS COME BACK TO CHECK ON THE EGGS?\nInterestingly, male sea turtles almost never return to land after being hatched. So, mothers come ashore along to nest, and once she returns to the water, she never comes back.\nHOW CAN WE HELP PROTECT THEM?\nTo ensure a safe turtle nesting season, please clean up any trash you see on the beach, avoid sea turtle nests, obey the Lights Out on Tybee program and level out sandcastles and holes.\nIf you are interested in seeing a sea turtle up close, the Tybee Island Marine Science Center is home to a loggerhead named Admiral, who serves as their Marine Debris Ambassador. The center offers valuable marine education and programs to keep our island informed and safe.']"	['<urn:uuid:89dd8791-a5e8-4747-9dd0-4dbcd4549509>', '<urn:uuid:9429443d-da65-4bfc-a612-80a6209f1762>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	12	114	2038
66	How do indigenous healers and Finnish forest restoration experts approach ecosystem preservation?	Both groups employ traditional knowledge but with different methods. Indigenous healers, particularly the Trio shamans, maintain complex medical systems using native flora and emphasize the transmission of healing practices through active practice. Meanwhile, Finnish forest restoration experts use controlled burning to replicate natural processes, which has proven successful in increasing biodiversity - for example, creating record numbers of polypore species and providing habitats for endangered insects. Both approaches recognize the importance of letting natural processes continue with minimal human interference.	"['Just north of Los Angeles on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean is a special piece of ancient tribal land. Prehistoric artifacts and burials indicate that occupation occurred there as early as 6000 BC. It was this primeval site on a crisp October night recently where the Wishtoyo Foundation and the Chumash people, in cooperation with the Amazon Conservation Team, held “A Summit of Indigenous Spiritual Leaders.”\nSince 1996, Dr. Mark Plotkin, President of the Amazon Conservation Team (ACT), has been spearheading programs and initiatives that work closely with these tribal leaders on their lands and creating alliances across cultural, biological, political and economic spectrum. Though this is daunting work to undertake in what are complex tropical environments, his intense, comprehensive, and holistic approach has proven extremely effective in protecting rainforest diversity and its people. This past July, ACT took the lead on a project that aims to prevent deforestation across 46 million ha (114 million acres) in the northeastern and southwestern sections of the Brazilian Amazon. The initiative, partially funded by the Skoll Foundation, which contributed $1.6 million, will “strengthen the capacity of the indigenous communities and government agencies to monitor, manage and protect the indigenous reserves and adjacent areas while creating positive conditions for long-term financing of forest protection,” according to a statement from the Skoll Foundation.\nDon Luciano in Brazil’s Xingu region\nThough deforestation and its impact are widely reported in the media, the destruction to native plants used for medicines by indigenous tribes typically goes unnoticed and is, simply put, catastrophic. This is extinction in its most violent form and one where the axiom, “we don’t know what we don’t know” moronically applies given our collective ignorance of the importance of native flora.\nIn addition to meeting several shaman at the Summit, I was lucky enough to connect with Dr. Chistopher Herndon, an ethnobotanist and physician at University of San Francisco and a member of ACT. He has been intimately involved in studying shamanic diagnostics and healing in remote indigenous villages deep in the rainforests of the Amazon. His research finds that shamans in the Trio tribe of the northeast Amazon have a complex understanding of disease concepts, one that is certainly comparable to Western medical science. Trio medicine men recognize at least 75 distinct disease conditions—ranging from common ailments like fever [këike] to specific and rare medical conditions like Bell’s palsy [ehpijanejan] and distinguish between old (endemic) and new (introduced since contact with the outside world) illnesses. As Herndon explains, “One cannot ‘save’ the medical systems of indigenous tribes alone through written inventories of their medical plant knowledge. Trio ethnomedicine, not unlike our healing tradition, is a complex art of diagnosis, examination, communication, ritual and treatment that can only be transmitted through active practice. The disintegration of traditional systems of health is most devastating to indigenous peoples, who at the same time often have very limited access to extrinsic medical resources. The adoption by organizations of programs that strengthen and retain tribal peoples’ self-sufficiency is critical for their health as well as to enable the transmission of these remarkable medical systems for the benefit of future generations.”\nThankfully, ACT has been successful in this area as well. ACT places great value on traditional knowledge and culture itself, since this determines community cohesion and unity. The intimate bond between indigenous cultures and the Amazon’s biodiversity expresses itself through our partners’ unparalleled knowledge of forest ecosystems, as well as in their healing traditions and other cultural expressions. This provides yet another reason for working with indigenous communities in conservation – they simply know the land and ecosystems better than anyone on the planet.\nAmasina in Suriname. Photo by Rhett A. Butler\nMy chance to meet the tribal elders occurred with the help of Liliana Madrigal, the Director of Program Operations and Co-founder of ACT. Liliana has been working in the conservation field for over two decades, and travels frequently to South America to meet and work directly with ACT’s indigenous partners in the Amazon, notably serving as chief liaison with shamans of the northwest Amazon. Liliana is responsible for the implementation of ACT’s women’s programs, which seek to build esteem, increase sustainable development opportunities and advance human rights among women of indigenous communities across Amazonia. Her initiative encouraged the formation in 2004 of the first full-fledged union of female traditional healers in the Colombian Amazon, the Asociación de Mujeres Indígenas de la Medicina Tradicional.\nWith Liliana as interpreter, I was able to ask a few questions of several elders from the Ingano tribe of Colombia. What I discovered is perhaps not that surprising, but no less disheartening. Basically, if a foreign corporation wants to explore for oil or other mineral wealth in forest around or on Ingano land, they must work with the Colombian equivalent of our EPA. However, the Colombian “EPA” doesn’t include the tribes in this process and consequently many of these projects, be it drilling or mining, are rubber-stamped approved. What regulation exists is often not enforced and the results aren’t just bad – they are disastrous.\nI asked the eldest Ingano, what has most changed since he was a young boy:\n“I can talk all day to you…. We had a big piece of land…it was all forest and everything was very traditional. Then they [the government] allowed the petrol companies to come in and afterwards the oil was everywhere. In the rivers, in the creeks, thick like glue (he cupped his hands to show me). I am a traditional medicine man and we used to be able to heal anything. Not now.”\nHis strong and weathered face told a story that words cannot reveal.\nAs sun set over the Pacific, Indigenous Healers, Elders, and other spiritual and environmental leaders of indigenous tribes from North America, Amazonia and Polynesia gathered around a fire pit in the main Chumash aps (dwelling). In the hopes of conveying their collective wisdom, scientific knowledge and compassion for humanity, these few remaining leaders sought to reach a broader audience of western guests whose influence could perhaps help reverse the unconscious destruction of an environment and its people. It was clearly an evening to watch and listen. The speeches in English, Spanish or tribal dialect proved poignant and revolved around one common theme – we are all in this together and what happens today affects all of us and the generations that follow. It is time to take notice, awaken, and act consciously. This exactly echoed what Mati Waiya, Director of the Wishtoyo Foundation, and Chumash Village said to a few of us earlier in the evening:\n“We may have been separated by race, religion, creed, wealth, or whatever has caused wars in the world, but there is only one world and one people. We need to engage together. It is a responsibility, and something we should never forget. We are deteriorating our own core because we are destroying our own world, and that is not healthy. We need to live, and appreciate our lives, moment to moment. We need to get back to living more natural, more sustainable lives, and to take care of our Mother better, our Mother Nature.”\nThe messages were clearly effectual as the audience’s awareness was almost palpable; we were ready for more…\nThe younger generation of the various tribes assumed positions around the fire. In the cool indigo night, a spiritual ceremony of song and dance slowly began to build. We all huddled a little bit closer. Sounds of drumming and chanting reverberated as lithe painted bodies and feathered headdresses swayed in rhythm. The smell of smoke and sage and red-orange fire heightened our senses. Through this timeless and sacred ritual of dance, the “Millennials” of these tribes seemed to embody and communicate a message of hope and reverence for a planet in need. What was heard earlier was now felt. No one left until the last song of prayer was sung. Something tells me 8000 years ago on this very bluff, ceremonies not unlike this one had taken place. Are we the wiser? These ceremonies remind us that something much greater than we can comprehend is at play here. Within that realization, do we embrace humanity – or do we reject it?', ""Natural Features of Patvinsuo National Park\nThe Autiovaara old-growth forest has been allowed to develop undisturbed for more than a hundred years. Among the spruce trees with beard lichen and the old pine trees, there are also large aspens growing in the area. The trees live long, die, fall down, and finally decay. The cycle resumes when the clearings left by the dead trees give rise to new saplings which grow toward the light.\nSuch a forest offers many nesting places for woodpeckers and other birds that make their nests in holes in trees, such as the rare red-breasted flycatcher. Inside the hollow aspens in their own little world lives a diverse array of fungi and insects. Dozens of species of lichen adorn the tree trunks and branches. When the trunks fall, an array of polypores settle in.\nThe forest buzzes with life, of which we humans only have a vague idea. On the Autiovaara Spruce Trail you can admire all of this in peace, and with your senses fine-tuned. There is no need to hurry in an old-growth forest.\nLake Suomunjärvi is in a ridge area that formed in the late part of the last ice age. There are about ten islands in the lake with labyrinthine inlets. There are about 24 kilometres of sandy shoreline. The depth of the lake varies, in the middle there are areas that reach depths of 27 metres, but there are also banks shallow enough to wade in. Lake Suomunjärvi is in excellent shape ecologically. It has not been harmed by human activity.\nFish in the lake include vendace, whitefish, perch, and pike. Fishing for vendace has been a favourite local tradition. The vendace population varies from year to year.\nThe Suomunkierto loop trail circles the lake. It mainly runs in the fairly even pine forest, but in places it touches the shore of the lake. Swimming on all of the sandy beaches of Lake Suomunjärvi is possible at one's own risk, but there are no official beaches for swimming in the area.\nIso Hietajärvi, another lake in the northern part of the national park, also has a sandy bottom and clear water. It is part of the Hietajärvi Integrated Monitoring area. In the monitoring area human impact is kept to a minimum. Moving in the area is restricted to marked trails except for cloudberry picking season. Fishing is prohibited in Iso Hietajärvi for the same reason.\nPatvinsuo has a flourishing bear population. Footprints of the park's emblem animal are a frequent sight, but the lord of the forest itself is skilful at keeping hidden. Only by a stroke of great luck will a hiker see a bear. The bear walks around usually in twilight and at night. In the summer, a male can wander hundreds of kilometres in a short period of time. Bears are also skilful swimmers.\nThe bear is Finland's national animal. It is the largest predator in Finland and all of Europe. The omnivorous bears feast on berries, ants, larvae, roots, and honey. In the autumn, bears go into their dens to hibernate. They will sleep for six months without food or drink. In January or February 1-4 cubs are born in the den. They follow their mothers closely throughout the following summer. They spend their first winters in the same dens as their mother.\nWolves, lynx, and wolverines are also known to wander regularly in the park. Footprints in the snow are their calling cards. In the summertime moose come to bogs in the national park to eat.\nAbout twenty North American Beaver also live in the area. Their dams and lodges can be found in many streams. The beaver population in North Karelia was started in 1945 when two pairs of North American Beaver were introduced to the Nälmänjoki River in 1945.\nThe nature of the swamps of the national park is varied: in addition to open raised bogs and aapa mires, there are pine-covered sloughs and forests dominated by spruce. Swamps cover more than half of the surface area of the park.\nCloudberries are the most sought-after gift of the swamps. The berries develop on the female flowers, but not without the help of male flowers that provide the pollen. On treeless swamps it is frustratingly common for frosty nights in early June to freeze the cloudberry flowers. Occasionally, heavy rains will knock the petals off the flowers, making them invisible to pollinators.\nTart cranberries can be found on wet treeless swamps and in sloughs with a sparse tree population. The berries do not ripen until the first frosts, in late September and early October. Many birds migrating in springtime happily eat berries from a previous year.\nProlific bog bilberries have popularly been considered unfit for human consumption. But there is no need! The mild-tasting berries are rich in vitamin C, among other things.\nThe swamps of the national park offer a multitude of nesting and feeding places for numerous species of birds. Many species that have disappeared from southernmost Finland survive in Patvinsuo. These include willow grouse, European golden plover, and whimbrel. Extensive treeless swamps also attract migratory birds that rest and eat in the area.\nIn the spring, a polyphonic concert of birds returning from their migration can be heard from the swamp. Magnificent views open up from the Teretinniemi bird tower for those who want to observe swamp birds. In June, bird couples quietly start nesting. When their chicks have hatched, waders can be heard again as they warn their offspring about dangers.\nWhen the neighbouring Patvinsuo National Park was founded, in 1982, the Kissansuo-Raanisuo-Tohlinsuo Mire Reserve was also set up. Kissansuo and Tohlinsuo have places with more nutrients than on the national park side. In the summer, the area is home to birds typical to the swamps: meadow pipits, western yellow wagtails, and several species of waders, such as common greenshanks and whimbrels.\nThe mire reserve does not have marked trails or other recreational structures. The nearest lean-to shelter and campfire site is in the south-east of the reserve, along the Susitaival trail on the edge of the Lutinjoki River. The area is accessible under Finland's everyman's rights.\nDrained swamps in the mire reserve have been restored. The drainage ditches were filled up using a backhoe in the late summer of 2006. Vegetation and other species typical of wetlands have started to recover from the disturbance caused by the restoration work, and the future of the swamps looks promising.\nForest has also been restored in Tohlinsuo: A clump of trees covering 20 hectares was burned in 2006. As a result, a large amount of decaying wood was left behind in the forest to benefit thousands of species of forest fauna and flora. Plenty of new small trees have sprouted in clearings from the restoration burn. The forest will increasingly resemble its natural state as time passes. Read more how the Kissansuo-Raanisuo-Tohlinsuo Mire Reserve Completes the Mire Entity of Patvinsuo National Park.\nTwo forest islands surrounded by swamps were burned in the Patvinsuo National Park in 1989, one in Lahnasuo and the other in Surkansuo. These are the first restoration burns of forest in Finland, and anywhere in Europe. Restoration burns replicate natural fires caused by lightning strikes. They kill some of the trees, while leaving others to grow.\nThe species of polypore fungi there have been followed closely for more than a quarter of a century. At first the number of species in both groves collapsed, but in just over ten years, the number of species of polypores had doubled compared with the situation before the burn.\nOver the years a total of 96 different species of polypores have been found on the Lahnasuo stand, which is a record for any individual hectare of forest land in Finland! These include several endangered species such as Antrodia primaeva, Diplomitoporus crustulinus, Skeletocutis stellae, as well as eastern specialities, such as the Trichaptum pargamenum.\nRestoration burning is the best way to diversify the structures of forests that have undergone felling. Trees killed by the fire are important habitats both for polypores, and for many endangered and rare insects. All residents of dead trees have their important tasks in the recycling of forest nutrients.\nIn the western part of Patvinsuo National Park, near Nälmänjärvi, wetlands had been drained before the protection areas had been set up. Now the ditches have been filled. They have also been removed from base maps, but the filled-up ditches can still be seen in aerial photographs. They should be crossed where the dams are located.\nRestored swamps do not immediately return to their former state, but the water surface immediately rises to a higher level than in a drained swamp. The rising water starts the return of the structure swamp vegetation, other species, and trees. Aerial photographs show that the restoration seems to be advancing at a good speed, after more than ten years since the work was done. The filled-up ditches are covered by vegetation, and sphagnum moss is thriving. It is unlikely that the former ditches will even be distinguishable from the rest of the area in 100 years. This is not a long time in comparison with the millennia that wetlands take to develop!\nPatvinsuo is one of the internationally Important Bird and biodiversity Areas, IBA. BirdLife Finland monitors the changes in the bird population of these areas. The bird population at Patvinsuo is also surveyed at intervals of 5 to 10 years (datazone.birdlife.org).\nThe Ramsar Convention (rsis.ramsar.org) also protects the bird population and the diversity of the wetlands and water areas.\nThe Hietajärvi area of the northern part of Patvinsuo is the second of two integrated monitoring research areas of the Finnish environment. The international programme monitors changes in the air, on land, and in the water in 50 monitoring areas in 16 countries.\nThe North Karelia Biosphere Reserve (kareliabiosphere.fi) covers the municipalities of Ilomantsi and Lieksa as well as Joensuu and Tuupovaara. The purpose of the Biosphere Reserves is to promote the preservation of natural diversity and to develop social, economic, and ecological sustainability. The Biosphere Reserve Programme is maintained in Finland by the Finnish Ministry of the Environment and the ELY Centres.\nRestricted areas have been set up in the large swamps of the national park, Patvinsuo and Lahnasuo in order to secure peaceful nesting for birds. In the nesting period for birds (1 March - 10 July) only marked trails in the restricted areas may be used. If you plan to take part in springtime swamp skiing, make sure you check the locations of the restricted areas on the map (julkaisut.metsa.fi)!\nPatvinsuo National Park\n- Established 1982\n- Area 105 km²\nThe Emblem of Patvinsuo National Park is Bear\nPart of the North Karelian Biosphere Reserve\nPatvinsuo National Park is part of the North Karelian Biosphere Reserve (kareliabiosphere.fi), which also includes Petkeljärvi National Park, Koivunsuo Strict Nature Reserve and Kesonsuo Nature Reserve.\nThe goal of UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere (MAB) programme is to develop the living conditions of the area's inhabitants while maintaining the protection of nature and the environment.""]"	['<urn:uuid:707838c0-e782-42a1-9da0-2cbaef46bc86>', '<urn:uuid:af03db58-0ac4-438a-ab5b-855f55b5780f>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	12	80	3217
67	How do fundraising events and general exhibitions differ in targeting audience?	General exhibitions target the broad public, displaying varieties of items like bags, belts, and shoes simultaneously, while fundraising events target specific pools of prospective donors through techniques like direct mail, telemarketing, and e-solicitation.	['Exhibition is the public display of artefacts such as manufactured goods, food, artefacts etc. in order to attract viewers and buyers. An effective exhibition should be well planned and organized. It is also noteworthy that only excellent works that merits appreciation and shows artists’ exceptional skills should be exhibited.The organization of an exhibition is very relevant. Its importance cannot be over-emphasized. Some of the purposes of organizing and mounting of an exhibition are outlined below:1. It showcases the designs and works of an artist: An exhibition mounted by an artist helps him to show the entire world what he/she is able to do. This invariably would help him to gain customers who may be interested in the purchase of any of his works or designs.2. It offers an avenue for the sale of products: An exhibition gives the artist the platform to explain the concepts and ideas behind his artistic creations and this would move viewers to purchase some of his mounted works.3. It promotes the manufacturer: An exhibition affords people the opportunity to know the manufacturer. This promotes and makes him popular or known.4. It promotes competition and creativity in the industry: When an exhibition is mounted by the artist, other artists come to view his artistic creations. These artists are inspired by the works seen and are challenged to produce works that surpasses those they have seen. This ensures the development of new ideas and new products in the industry.5. It entertains all in attendance: People who come for the exhibition are entertained after viewing the varied products of the artist. They gain new experiences of artistic productions and this greatly entertains them. Also, it may help them to get new friends and interact with people of different backgrounds. The side attractions such as the music played at the occasion all adds an entertainment flavor to the entire programme.\nExhibitions are broadly classified into two. These are General exhibitions and specialized exhibitions. General Exhibition is whereby varieties of items are displayed to the general public. It attracts all kinds of exhibits or works. It should be noted that several products are exhibited during general exhibitions. Several products such as Bags, belts, shoes etc. are exhibited at the same time. It can be called a Bazaar or Fair.On the contrary, specialized exhibition involves the display of a specific kind of product or artifact. For instance, when only bags are exhibited, we can say it is a specialized exhibition. However, varieties of the same product thus, bags are exhibited.It should be noted that either of these types of exhibition can be organized at various levels such as Individual exhibition, Group exhibition, Institutional exhibition, Community exhibition, District exhibition, Regional exhibition, National exhibition and International exhibition.An effective exhibition should be well thought of or planned before it is organized. Several factors come to the fore in the planning of an exhibition.1. Type of exhibition- The artist or organizers of the exhibition should seriously consider the type of exhibition that they want to mount whether a specialized or generalized exhibition. If the exhibition is organized by a different body, the artist should make the necessary inquiry through trade publications, newspapers, internet etc. to know precisely the type of exhibition to be organized. This would help him to prepare accordingly.2. What to exhibit-The artist should deeply consider the kinds of exhibit to mount. He should consider the theme of the exhibition, the background of the potential viewers such as their age group, sex, levels of education and even their income levels. This would aid him in knowing the kind of artefacts to exhibit.3. Where to exhibit- The place or venue for the exhibition should be carefully considered. Its location should be at the heart or centre of his most expected guests or the target group. The venue must be easy to locate. The premises should be spacious, clean, well ventilated and well lit.4. Cost involved- The cost to be incurred for the organization of the entire exhibition should be carefully rolled out. The cost of publicity, side attractions/ programmes, preparation of the venue etc. must be well planned.5. Publicity- This refers to the means by which the organisers want to broadcast or make known the exhibition to the general public. The best and most effective means of publicity should be adopted and implemented. Should it be done through posters, banners, flyers, signposts, open air announcement, brochures or the internet? The organizers should think about it critically.6. Expected number of guests/visitors- The number of people to be expected at the exhibition grounds should be well thought of. This would help the organizers to plan the exhibition well. It would enable them to choose the right venue in terms of size, the number of seating etc. for the exhibition.\n7. Duration/Time- The length of time for the exhibition should be planned well. Will the exhibition last for a day, days etc. The time for the start of the programme and the time it would end should be thought of carefully and communicated with the expected guests prior to the programme.8. Security- The organizers should beef up the security at the exhibition grounds to protect the exhibitors, invitees and the exhibits. This would make all in attendance very secured.9. Visitor’s book- This is a special book that is made available to all the invited guests to write down their names, contacts, comments and experiences. This would enable artists to contact prospective buyers of their products and in the planning of future exhibitions.10. General layout- The entire arrangement of the exhibits, seating etc. should be artistic and nice. There shouldn’t be any room for crowdedness and congestion. The place should be comely and refreshing.Exhibitions are the enticements that draw people to the products and services offered by a business. Therefore it must be carefully planned. This would ensure that the products manufactured by individuals, groups or enterprises will have mass sales and sensitization among the populace.', 'Introduction to Event Management and Business Success: This course introduces the principles and history of the event industry.

68	wood beam H configuration assembly steps outdoor playground structure	Take two 20-inch pieces of wood and lay them on the ground. Align the holes that are 5 3/8 inches from the bottom with the holes in a 13 1/2 inch piece to form an H shape. Place two more 20-inch pieces on top of the 13 1/2 inch piece, aligning the same holes. Insert carriage bolts through these aligned holes and secure them with nuts to hold the assembly together.	"['- Drill a hole, using a 13 mm drill bit, 5 3/8 inches from one edge in the center of each of the 20 inch wood pieces. On the other end of the planks, drill a hole 2 3/8 inches from the edge and another hole three inches from that hole. Drill holes in the 13 1/2 inch piece of wood in the center of each side, 1 1/4 inch from the edge.\n- Lay two of your 20 inch pieces on the ground and align the single hole in them that is 5 3/8 inches from the bottom of the piece of wood with the holes in the 13 1/2 inch piece so that it resembles the letter ""H"" in shape. Place the two remaining 20 inch pieces of wood on top of the 13 1/2 inch piece and align the same holes. Insert the carriage bolts into the holes you just aligned to hold the pieces of wood together. Tighten nuts onto the end of the carriage bolts to hold the bolts secure.\n- Place thin boards, metal or any material that would be strong enough to hold concrete into the inside of the tire.\n- Make a mix of concrete using six spades full of gravel, four spades full of sand and two spades full of cement. The ratio should be one part cement, two parts sand and three parts gravel. Mix the ingredients together before adding water. Fill the wheelbarrow three-quarters of the way full. Add a half standard bucket of water to the mix. Add a little water at a time while using the spade to fold the concrete over. Keep mixing the concrete until the consistency is even.\n- Use a shovel to put concrete into the tire. Add a little concrete at a time and allow it to enter the rim of the tire. Be careful not to add too much concrete or it can be hard to install the support into the tire base.\n- Place the wooden piece you just built down into the tire so that the two sets of drilled holes are at the top and the first single set of holes that have galvanized screws in them are above the tire rim. Shift the wooden piece until the bottom settles at the bottom of the tire. Make sure that the first set of holes is above the tire rim before adding concrete. Fill the remainder of the tire with concrete. Use a tool to poke around in the tire to ensure that all of the areas in the tire have been filled.\n- Place a straight wooden plank up against the side of the wooden support unit on the tire. Place a set square on the plank to check that the wooden support unit is at a right angle. Check each side to make sure that it is at a right angle.\n- Use a set square as a guide to mark a center dotted line on the middle teeter totter plank. Mark two separate solid lines a half inch on either side of the center line. This will be the space where your pivot bar will sit.\n- Use three nails and slightly hammer them into the lines you marked. Hammer one nail toward the top of one solid line, another nail on the opposite solid line in the middle and the last nail hammered on the bottom of the line where you hammered the first nail. The nails will hold the pivot bar in place.\n- Place the pivot bar in between the nails and make sure that equal sides of the pivot bar are hanging off of the edge of the plank.\n- Use saddle clips to place over the pivot bar at equal distances and fasten them into place. Take the three nails out after the pivot bar has been attached.\n- Insert two carriage bolts into the top drill holes depending on the height you would like the teeter totter to rest. Fasten the bolts into place with nuts.\n- Place the middle plank onto the pivot bar and position into place.\nHow to Build a Large Teeter Totter\nA teeter totter is a plank that rests upon a base.

69	How did Jefferson Davis spend his final years?	In 1877, a wealthy widow named Sarah Anne Dorsey invited Davis to live at her estate 'Beauvoir' near Biloxi, Mississippi. There, he wrote 'The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government' with Sarah serving as his assistant. When Sarah died in 1879, she willed her entire estate to Davis. He eventually caught a cold during a visit to his plantation 'Brierfield' and died of bronchitis in New Orleans on December 6, 1889. Over 50,000 people came to pay their respects as his body lay in state. He was later buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond in 1893.	['Davis’ imprisonment helped fame\nRobert E. Lee telegraphed Jefferson Davis who was in his pew at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Richmond.\nHis message to Davis read: “I advise that all preparation be made for leaving Richmond tonight.” Davis left the church service that Sunday morning to collect the Confederacy’s financial assets, government records, and political personnel.\nHe would take the Confederate government elsewhere. A woman who was sitting behind Davis in the church remembered seeing the “gray pallor that came upon his face as he read a scrap of paper thrust into his hand” by the messenger.\nDavis had expected Richmond to fall, but not for awhile. He and his cabinet headed for Danville, Va., the last capital of the Confederacy on April 2, 1865.\nThis town of 6,000 had been selected well in advance of Richmond’s fall. Danville lay near the North Carolina border. Davis insisted that he would not leave Virginia until “Robert E. Lee was whipped out of it.” Davis and his cabinet stayed in Danville for one week.\nOn April 10, 1865, Davis heard of Lee’s surrender and the cabinet and Davis headed for Greensboro, N.C. The people there feared that if they offered their homes to Davis, the Federal army would burn Greensboro. Davis met with P.G.T. Beauregard and Joseph E. Johnston and tried to get them to gather conscripts and deserters to increase the Confederate army’s numbers.\nAt a second meeting that same day, Johnston, whom Davis detested, told Davis: “It would be the greatest of human crimes for us to attempt to continue the war.” Davis asked Beauregard for his opinion.\nBeauregard and all present at the meeting felt to continue the war was not feasible. Jefferson Davis was alone in insisting that the Civil War continue. Davis and his cabinet prepared to continue their flight, possibly to Alabama or to the Trans – Mississippi Theater.\nHis cabinet wanted to safely get Davis “out of the country.” His “government on wheels” now sought to evade capture by the federals.\nPresident Davis and his party left for Charlotte, N.C., on the evening of April 15, 1865. The federal cavalry had captured the railroad, so they had to ride horseback and suffer being drenched by heavy rains.\nDavis had sent his wife to Charlotte weeks before his arrival. His wife had already fled Charlotte. Davis, with his party reduced to 20 men and 3 wagons would eventually catch up with his family near Irwinville, Ga., 70 miles from the Florida border.\nDavis’ family was being escorted by Burton Harrison, Davis’ personal secretary. Davis and his small party heard a rumor that a group of disbanded soldiers was planning to attack Davis’ family and rob them.\nAfter an all night ride and just before dawn, Davis found his family quite safe on May 7, 1865.\nHe and his family were united for the first time in five weeks. Davis had been running for one month since his meetings in Danville. His party had travelled 400 miles.\nOn May 9, 1865, Davis and his family made camp at 5 p.m. He was supposed to leave after darkness came, but fell into a deep sleep. At dawn on May 10, 1865, two regiments of Union cavalry were closing in on Davis’ camp.\nThey rode in from different directions and a 15-minute mistaken battle between the Union forces ensued. Davis thought the intruders were Southern raiders and vowed to go and have them stop firing. He soon saw the attackers were Union cavalry and his wife Varina encouraged him to escape.\nHe accidentally picked up his wife’s raincoat and she placed her shawl around his shoulders. A Union soldier aimed his carbine at him. Varina begged him to surrender. Davis uttered, “God’s will be done!” and sat down on a fallen tree near the campfire. A Union colonel said to Davis, “Well, old Jeff, we’ve got you at last.”\nUnion troops insulted him by saying, “Get a move on, Jeff.” After a few days, Davis was imprisoned at Fort Monroe, Va., on May 22, 1865. The United States government wanted revenge after President Lincoln was assassinated and accused Davis of being involved.\nAt Fort Monroe, Davis was constantly humiliated. A ball and chain was put upon him by a blacksmith. He was forbidden to exercise. He was refused a knife and fork while eating.\nA lamp burned throughout the night in his cell. Guards were to walk their posts continuously outside his cell. Doctors warned the fort commander, Nelson A. Miles, that Davis’ health was deteriorating.\nIn April of 1866, 11 months after his being imprisoned, Varina was permitted to visit her husband. Varina had tried all of this time to get her husband released. She succeeded in May of 1867 — after two years! A federal court in Richmond ordered Davis released on a $100,000 bond guaranteeing his appearance at a trial.\nThe trial for Davis never convened. The federal government dropped the charges of being involved in the Lincoln Assassination and of treason.\nIn 1877, a wealthy widow, Sarah Anne Dorsey, invited Davis to live at “Beauvoir,” her estate near Biloxi, Miss. Sarah rented a cottage there to Davis and served as his amanuensis when he wrote his two-volume work “The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government.”\nVarina, Davis’ wife, would not come to “Beauvoir.” In 1879, Sarah Anne Dorsey died from cancer and willed her entire estate to Jefferson Davis. He now had a home again.\nJefferson Davis caught cold while taking one last visit to his beloved plantation, “Brierfield.”\nHe died of bronchitis in New Orleans on Dec. 6, 1889. His body lay in state at the City Hall in New Orleans and mourners from all\nover the South came to pay their respects. For three days and nights, over 50,000 people walked past his casket.\nIn 1893, his body was moved to Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. He was placed there to be with his six children, several grandchildren, and Varina who died in 1905.\nDavis refused to apply for his American citizenship. In 1978, nearly a century after his death, the United States Congress restored his citizenship. Davis once explained to the Mississippi state legislature: “Repentance has to precede pardon and I have not repented.”\nFew people in the South truly loved him, but thousands respected the man who made himself the symbol of the “Lost Cause.”\nBob Leith is a history professor at Ohio University Southern.']	['<urn:uuid:0e2c9b51-d90e-4b99-94c3-c151bbd2ff20>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	8	97	1075
70	What methods are available for ensuring proper water depth in fish passages across different seasons and species requirements?	Water depth requirements vary by species and are managed through several approaches. For physical measurements, Alaska requires depth to be greater than 2.5 times a fish's caudal fin depth - for example, a 60mm juvenile Coho Salmon needs approximately 48mm water depth. Washington State specifies minimum depths of 0.24m for Adult Trout, Pink and Chum Salmon, and 0.30m for adult Chinook, Coho, Sockeye or Steelhead. To maintain these depths, structures like rigid weirs can be designed with passage chutes and adjustable features. Flow management is based on low fish passage flows, often using the 2-year 7-day low flow (roughly 95% exceedance flow) as a design standard to ensure adequate depth is maintained during critical migration periods.	"['Using fish counting weirs to tally migrating salmonids is familiar territory for FISHBIO: we have been operating these devices on multiple rivers for over a decade, and have fabricated many more for other organizations throughout the West. Up until now, we have specialized in floating resistance board weirs. This type of weir has many advantages: it can operate under a wide range of river flows, can withstand heavy debris, is easy to clean, and allows for boat passage over it. But the biggest obstacle is that this design don’t easily allow for fish to pass in the downstream direction, just upstream. We have tried modifying the design, such as making a depressed area in which fish can pass over the weir and into a livebox (fish trap) to be counted and released, but this has not proved effective.\nIn one of our current monitoring projects, we need to count both upstream and downstream fish passages near a hydropower facility. Because of the limitation of a resistance weir for this purpose, we decided to use a rigid weir design that will allow unimpeded fish passage both upstream and downstream. The design consists of a passage chute located in the middle of the channel, with rigid weir panels extending both upstream and downstream to each bank. The rigid weir panels form a fyke that guides fish to the center passage chute. The passage chute consists of a custom-fabricated aluminum frame with a white acrylic floor and sides. In order to identify and count fish going through the passing chute, we equipped it with three HD video cameras and infrared lights. The cameras are connected to a computer located on shore that continuously records, and also makes short clips of fish passage thanks to motion detection software. The camera system is virtually the same as the Smolt Spy system we designed for the Summit Lake Paiute Tribe.\nOur FABLAB built in some clever features to the rigid weir panels in order improve their function for this particular application. Rigid weir panels need to have some infrastructure to hold them in place against the current. This is usually accomplished by using tripod structures or cabling to hold the rigid weir panels upright. To eliminate the additional infrastructure, the FISHBIO crew welded legs that hinge on the panels and are adjustable in length. We also made sturdy clamps to attach the weir panels together so they essentially function as a single rigid plane. The riverbed at the fish monitoring site is mostly very rough material, such as large cobbles. This uneven river bottom can create gaps along the bottom of the weir panels where fish can slip through. To address this issue, our technicians slid steel pipes down each picket, which allows the bottom of the weir panels to follow the contour of the substrate bottom.\nThis weir has been in operation for several weeks now, and has allowed us to successfully record fish swimming freely both upstream and downstream. One challenge of rigid weirs is they are known for not withstanding debris trying to pass through, and often get blown out. We are hoping that the proximity to the powerhouse and dam will reduce the amount of debris that collects on the weir, but our team is ready to respond and keep the weir functioning if things get messy.', '|Scour Technology | Bridge Hydraulics | Culvert Hydraulics | Highway Drainage | Hydrology | Environmental Hydraulics|\n|FHWA > Engineering > Hydraulics > Environmental Hydraulics > Design For Fish Passage at Roadway > Fish Passage Hydrology|\nDesign For Fish Passage at Roadway - Stream Crossings: Synthesis Report\n5 Fish Passage Hydrology\nHow to use this chapter\n5.1 Hydrologic considerations for fish passage design\nCrossings should allow fish passage at a range of flows corresponding to the timing and extent of fish movement within the channel reach. The use of Hydraulic Design techniques tailored to specific fish species and life stages and the need to assess existing culverts for fish passage requires knowledge of fish swimming ability and site hydrology in order to create a passable structure. This process necessitates a more thorough understanding of site flow characteristics than is provided by a typical hydraulic analysis for structure stability. The following discussion details typical design requirements, including state-of-practice hydrology.\n18.104.22.168 Timing and Extent of Fish Presence\nThe timing of fish presence, including migration if important, must be considered when determining appropriate hydrology for fish passage design. Fish presence can vary from watershed to watershed (Scott and Crossman 1973), and in-stream flows may show great disparity with timing of fish migration .\nIn addition, the presence of multiple fish species can quickly convolute evaluation of fish passage hydrology. Figure 5.1 depicts the general timing of fish spawning migrations for a number of freshwater species in Virginia. Determining species presence and sensitivity within a stream reach requires site-specific knowledge, and consultation with a local fisheries biologist is essential.\n22.214.171.124 Species and Life Stage\nTiming and movement of regional fish populations will depend on fish species and life stage. In the Pacific Northwest, for example, adult salmon and steelhead migrate in the fall and winter months, while juvenile salmon migrate in the spring as fry and in the fall as fingerlings (Bates et al. 2003). Culverts designers in Maine must consider spawning movement of Atlantic salmon from May to November (Maine Department of Transportation 2004). In addition, resident fish may require movement at any time of the year (Kahler and Quinn 1998; Gowan et al. 1994). Due to variable abilities and periods of migration, each fish species and life stage may necessitate a different set of hydrologic constraints.\n126.96.36.199 Representing Seasonal Flows\nWhile predictions of instantaneous peak discharges with return periods of between 25 and 100 years are used for flood conveyance design, fish passage is considered at much smaller flows, less than bankfull discharges. Consequently, flow duration curves (FDC) are useful tools for determining fish flows. For example, a high fish passage discharge may be the discharge exceeded 10% of the time during migration or fish movement season (see Figure 5.1), while a low-flow requirement may be the flow that is equaled or exceeded 90% of the time.\nHowever, the FDC used in analysis of fish passage flows, such as in Figure 5.2, represent averages and fail to account for annual variations in hydrology. A study in Northern California found a culvert using specified low-flow criteria (90% migration period exceedance) created a 1-day migration delay in WY99 (a ""wet"" year) but a 10-day delay in WY2001 (a ""dry"" year) (Lang et al. 2004).\n5.1.2 Extreme Events\n188.8.131.52 Fish Response\nEven within a period of fish migration, design is not intended to provide fish passage at all flows. In a natural stream reach, fish respond to high flow events by seeking out shelter until passable conditions resume (Robison et al. 1999). During extreme low flows, shallow depths may cause the channel itself to become impassable (Clarkin et al. 2003; Lang et al. 2004). Generally, upper and lower thresholds bound the flow conditions at which fish passage must be provided.\n184.108.40.206 Allowable Delay\nFish may be able to handle a short interruption to upstream migration without negative consequences. The extent of this ""allowable delay"" depends on the timing and motivations for fish movement. A resident fish may be able to tolerate a short delay without extreme consequences, while a delay of a few days may be detrimental to spawning salmon, whose migrations involve significant physical changes, including a rapid depletion of fat and protein reserves (Groot and Margolis 1991). The delay caused by a single culvert can be compounded by a series of culverts that present short delays, making it imperative to understand a crossing\'s place in the overall watershed context. Delay has a number of negative consequences including stress and physical damages, susceptibility to disease and predation, and reduction in spawning success (Ashton 1984).\n220.127.116.11 Migration Flows\nAs discussed in Chapter 2, fish movement is triggered by time of year, flow events and a number of environmental factors. For example, the upstream migration of spawning salmon is hypothesized to be in response to maturation, the changing length of days, and temperature regimes (Groot and Margolis 1991). Consultation with local fisheries biologists will help ensure that hydrology is properly matched to requirements of local fish populations.\n5.2 Design Requirements\nFlood design discharge is estimated for all culverts. For Hydraulic Design and assessment of existing culverts, two additional discharges are required: high and low fish passage flows. These are often compared to bankfull discharge.\n5.2.1 High Fish Passage Flows\nA high fish passage flow captures the upper bound at which fish are believed to be moving within the stream. Fish passage requirements should be met at all discharges up to and including the high fish passage flow. This may exclude flows falling below a lower threshold, known as the low fish passage flow.\nTable 5.1 shows a comparison of available State and agency guidelines for high fish passage flows. Many states use an exceedance flow between 1 and 10% of the annual flow duration curve (a 10% exceedance flow is met or surpassed 10% of the year). It has been suggested that spawning adults should be delayed no more than 3 days during the average annual flood, or 7 days during the 50-yr flood (Ashton 1984).\n+High flows are for Hydraulic Design Approaches only, with the exception of Alaska and Idaho.\n5.2.2 Low Fish Passage Flows\nLow fish passage flows define the lower bound at which fish passage is required. This flow condition is used to ensure that depth and velocity barriers are not created within a crossing. Flows below this threshold may cause the channel itself to present a depth barrier to fish movement (Clarkin et al. 2003).\nSpecific depth requirements vary with the species and life stage of concern. Alaska requires that depth be greater than 2.5 times the depth of a fish\'s caudal fin (Alaska Department of Fish and Game and Alaska Department of Transportation 2001). For example, a 60 mm (0.2 ft) juvenile Coho Salmon requires a water depth of approximately 48 mm (1.9 in). Washington State specifies a minimum depth of 0.24 m (0.8 ft) for Adult Trout, Pink and Chum Salmon, and a depth of 0.30 m (1.0 ft) for adult Chinook, Coho, Sockeye or Steelhead (Bates et al. 2003).\nTable 5.2 depicts available current state guidelines for low flow analysis of fish crossings. Many current design manuals specify design based on a 2-yr 7-day low flow, roughly corresponding to the 95% exceedance flow.\n+ Low flows are for Hydraulic Design approaches only, with the exception of Alaska.\n5.2.3 Bankfull Flow\nBankfull flow is the discharge at which flow from the main channel begins to spill over into the floodplain (see Glossary). Generally, this discharge is referenced as the 1- to 2-yr flood event (Leopold and Wolman 1957), although this does not always correspond to field observations (Mussetter 1989). Bankfull is an important parameter in alluvial channels, as it is the discharge that effectively transports the most sediment, impacting long-term channel form, function, and stability (Harrelson et al. 1994). Although bankfull flow is rarely calculated for fish passage analysis, the concept of bankfull width is an important design parameter for fish passable structures. This concept will be discussed further in Chapter 6.\n5.2.4 Streambed Stability and Crossing Capacity\nAlthough design for fish passage will generally control structure size, culverts must still comply with flood flow conveyance requirements. At any road crossing, structure stability must be maintained up to and including a design flood (Norman et al. 2005). An outline of the hydrologic cycle, and methods for determining extreme flows are included in HDS-2 (Federal Highway Administration 2002).\nOccasionally, design methods will also require that streambed material be sized for stability during a specific design flood (e.g. Alaska Department of Fish and Game and Alaska Department of Transportation 2001; Bates et al. 2003). Generally, this stability analysis corresponds to the discharge used to check culvert capacity - on the order of a 50-year event. Table 5.3 includes design flows used for streambed stability in fish culverts.\n* Streambed stability check required\n5.2.5 Tidal Influence\nThe hydrology of culverts in tidal areas requires consideration of both upland flow and tidal impact (Zevenbergen et al. 2004). Methods for determining culvert outflow with changes in tidal elevation must account for stream flow as well as tidal outflow as an ebbing tide causes water to return to the ocean. Successfully meeting fish passage provisions may require tidal data in appropriate time increments and a continuous hydrologic simulation model for tidal elevations and stream flow. Examples include the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\'s Hydrological Simulation Program - Fortran (HSPF) or Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) (Bates et al. 2003). Observed and predicted tidal elevations, including information on benchmarks for tidal stations, are available on NOAA\'s internet site at http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/.\nA detailed discussion of tidal patterns, influence, and references are provide in Hydraulic Engineering Circular 25, available at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/, and the Army Corps of Engineers has a number of publications on construction in coastal areas, available at www.usace.army.mil.\n5.3 Hydrologic Procedures\nProcedures for determining flood conveyance and streambed stability discharges are well defined and can be found in State drainage design manuals.\nProcedures for determining high and low discharges for fish passage are not as well established. For culvert locations at or near long-term stream gages, statistical analyses will yield estimates for (1) 7-day low flows for return periods of interest and (2) discharges associated with the percent time exceeded during the year, based on the flow duration curve.\nMost culverts are located at ungaged sites. Determination of high and low fish passage flows will likely be based on statistical regression methods using local or regional stream gages (Rowland et al. 2003; Powers and Saunders 1996)']"	['<urn:uuid:9755e9c0-0a80-47d9-86c9-3a59edfbf79a>', '<urn:uuid:089f7279-edcb-456e-b71e-2d4ed97679c6>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	18	116	2302
71	What's the difference between feeding homemade and commercial food?	In aquaponics, commercial fish food is packed with nutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fat, and minerals) that help fish mature, while homemade options like duckweed, worms, or larvae can be more cost-effective. For bearded dragons, commercial options include calcium-dusted insects and multivitamin supplements, while natural foods include fresh vegetables, leafy greens, and live insects - though wild-caught insects should never be used as they can carry parasites and diseases.	['In an aquaponic system, the fish play a major role. Your fish will be producing the waste that the plants will need to grow and survive.\nIn order to get the most out of your aquaponics system, you’ll need to make sure that you’re taking proper care of your fish. Since they are the key part of your system, you should do your best to provide them with the things that they need.\nWhen you’re trying to determine how to feed your fish, you need to decide how much you will feed them, along with how often. When you feed your fish, your fish should be able to eat all of the food in around five minutes.\nIf your fish cannot eat all of the food that you put in, you’ll need to remove the leftover food. You should also consider reducing the amount that you are giving your fish. When feeding your fish, you’ll need to choose feeding times.\nIf you have a small amount of fish, you may need to feed your fish more frequently so that they will produce the amount of waste that your plants need. If you have too many fish for your plants, you can reduce the number of times that you feed them.\nTo get the most out of your aquaponics fish, you should be feeding with quality food. Since the waste of the fish makes your plants grow, good quality food will provide your plants with the best nutrients that they can get. One option of fish food is commercial fish food. This fish food is either carnivorous or omnivorous.\nThe type of fish that you have will determine which type is better for your fish. Commercial fish food is packed with nutrients that will help your fish mature. The fish food is made up of protein, carbohydrates, fat, and minerals.\nAlthough the commercial fish feed is liked by many, other people decide to go a different route. Many people grow their own fish food. This option can be a great way to save even more money.\nA few of the most popular homemade fish feeds are duckweed, worms, or larvae. Duckweed is a type of plant that grows very quickly. This plant has a lot of protein that can be great for your fish.\nWorms can be a great way to give your fish a bit of food. It’s difficult to grow a large number of worms, so it can be an occasional food that your fish get. Another option, larvae of the Black Soldier Fly, can make great food for your fish. You can even buy a device that will harvest the larvae for you.\nWith the proper knowledge, your fish will be thriving in no time. Once you’ve learned about how to feed your fish, the type of foods that they need, and when to feed your fish, you’ll soon see your fish maturing right before your eyes.\nYou’ll successfully raise fish while providing your plants the nutrients that they need to give you a great harvest.', 'So you’ve just brought home your very first Bearded Dragon…Like many, you’re probably wondering wondering what to feed it, how much to feed, and how often to serve up meals.\nIt can be difficult and time consuming to scour the internet in search of the best articles and advice – so we took the liberty of gathering everything you’ll need to know about feeding bearded dragons. Keep reading for some of the best tips and recommendations you’ll need to keep your dragon’s diet and eating habits right on track.\nBaby Bearded Dragon Diet\nFor younger bearded dragons, it is very important to keep their diets omnivorous with the right balance of plant and animal matter.\nThis ratio will change as dragons grow and mature – for baby dragons, bigger portions of leafy salads and smaller amounts of insects like Dubia Roaches or Phoenix Worms should be fed daily.\nBest Insects for Baby Bearded Dragons\nAs we covered above, insects are the backbone of any baby bearded dragon diet. Here are a few types of insects that we recommend for baby beardies:\n- Dubia Roaches\n- Phoenix Worms\nBest Greens for Baby Bearded Dragons\nAlthough greens make up only 20% of a baby bearded dragon’s diet, they are still extremely important. Here are a few types of greed that we recommend:\n- Collard Greens\n- Turnip Greens\n- Dandelion Greens\n- Mustard Greens\nModifying Meals as Your Dragon Matures\nJust like any animal, a bearded dragons’ diets change as it matures. After all, humans don’t eat the same foods their entire life, right?\nThe ratio between insects and greens used to create a baby dragon’s diet will flip as they mature – adults will be better nourished by a diet consisting of 80% greens/veggies and 20% insects.\nLarge leafy salads and an assortment of veggies should be readily available to your bearded dragon every day (with a few worms or roaches added to the mix). Their eating schedule will also change with time, and we’ve got details below on what to expect and what to watch out for.\nBest Insects For Bearded Dragons\nIt is recommended that, when feeding a bearded dragon, each meal should consist primarily of fresh salads and live feeder insects (with some calcium sprinkled in and a multivitamin to top it all off). When looking for the right insects to feed your dragon, there is a wide variety of good staples to choose from.\n1. Phoenix/Repti Worms\nA top recommendation from many experts, Phoenix/Repti Worms are a healthy choice for feeder insects. They are the larvae of Black Soldier Flies (and though they are small in size, they make up for it with a hefty amount of calcium). Their shells are soft enough to make them easy to eat for bearded dragons young and old.\n2. Dubia Roaches\nOf a higher quality and nutritional value than crickets, Dubia Roaches (Blaptica dubia) and Discoid Roaches (Blaberus discoidalis) are both great choices depending on what’s available. These are definitely some of the healthiest options out there!\nCrickets definitely aren’t the best option – there’s nothing bad about them, they just aren’t the most nutritious insect to feed you bearded dragon. That said, crickets are readily available (at almost any pet store) and can made more nutritious by dusting them with calcium and multivitamins.\n4. Silk Worms\nThe nutritional benefits of the Silk Worm can be helpful for bearded dragons of any age. They are packed full of protein and low in unhealthy fats. It is also recommended that you feed your dragon gravid (pregnant) female worms when available for extra nourishment.\nVarious types of superworm include Hornworms, Butterworms, and Silk Worms (also listed above). Juvenile to adult bearded dragons can be fed any kind of superworm and enjoy them as treats with their meals.\nOther Common (and safe) Worm Options\nWax worms, King worms, and earthworms also make great snacks for your Bearded Dragon. They may not pack as much of a nutritional punch, but dragons love them and they make for a great occasional snack.\nFeeding the Proper Greens\nProviding daily salads full of dark, leafy greens is important in maintaining the health of your bearded dragon. Some recommendations for the most nutritional types of greens are\n- Mustard Greens\n- Collard Greens\n- Dandelion Greens\n- Turnip Greens\n- Escarole (Chicory Greens\n- Coriander (occasionally)\nYou can also include Romaine Lettuce if you like, though only sparingly, as Romaine is limited in its nutritional value. For a healthy supplement, sprinkle some Repashy’s Superveggie (the perfect dietary supplement for omnivores like your bearded dragon) over the salad and the other vegetables that accompany it.\nIn addition to the daily salads, your bearded dragon should also have a wide variety of vegetables made available to them every day. For younger bearded dragons, make sure that you chop up any vegetable really good – otherwise, you risk blocking up your pet.\nOlder bearded dragons should be able to handle slightly bigger chunks. Some of the best choices are green beans, acorn squash, butternut squash, yucca roots, konnayu (purple yams), and red peppers. With a sprinkling of Repashy’s Superveggie, any of the listed veggies will provide the perfect nourishment for your growing bearded dragon.\nOther Options (Raw Only): There are several other common options out there, but some must specifically be served raw to be safest for your dragon to eat. These include bell peppers, shaved carrots, cabbage, lentils, zucchini, asparagus, and okra. You may also consider leaving any yams raw when you feed your bearded dragon as the texture might be preferable this way.\nFruits – Yes or No?\nIt is important to note that many fruits are high in natural sugars, so it is recommended that you only include fruits in your bearded dragon’s diet as an occasional treat (or for training purposes).\nDo: It is safe to feed your dragon mango, papaya, grapes, or blueberries as a treat or reward, as long as it’s not too often and you don’t give them too many. It is also safe to include the occasional slice of melon or banana as a fruity treat. Apples, cranberries, strawberries, and watermelon are also safe options, should you wish to vary your bearded dragon’s treats from time to time.\nDon’t: Oranges, Lemons, Limes, and Tomatoes are highly acidic and, along with other citrus fruits (or even rhubarb), are not recommended as a staple of your dragon’s diet. Avocadoes are too high in fat and are technically toxic in nature, so it is not recommended that you feed your dragon these fruits, either.\nFoods To Avoid (At All Costs!)\nThere are some specific foods that you should never feed you bearded dragon. Here are a few that you should at all costs:\n- Avocados: High in fat and very toxic to bearded dragons.\n- Spinach: Inhibits the binding of calcium, which can lead to deficiencies in your bearded dragon.\n- Beet Tops: Can be toxic to bearded dragons.\n- Tomatos: To acidic for bearded dragons. Can be fed in moderation, but probably best avoided.\n- Lettuce: Not the worst food on our list, but offers zero nutritional value.\n- Rhubarb: Known to be toxic to bearded dragons.\n- Acidic fruits (Lemon, Oranges, Grapefruits, etc.): Can be toxic to bearded dragons.\n- Fireflies: Extremely toxic to bearded dragons! Avoid at all costs.\n- Wild-caught insects: Wild-caught insects can very easily infect your bearded dragon with parasites and diseases. You should never feed your beardie anything that you catch yourself.\nHow Often Should Bearded Dragons Eat?\nAs babies, bearded dragons will often eat multiple meals a day at pretty regular intervals. They tend eat less often as they age, sometimes choosing to eat only once every couple days. This is perfectly normal and nothing to worry about – though it is suggested that you make fresh salads available to them every day, should they need a little snack.\nTo summarize the image above, here is a rough guide for insect feeding intervals based on your bearded dragon’s age:\n- 1-4 Months Old: 3 feedings per day\n- 4-12 Months Old: 2 feedings per day\n- 12-20 Months Old: 1 feeding per day\n- 20+ Months Old: 1 feeding every other day\nOnce your bearded dragon is over two years old, you can even reduce feedings down to every 2 days. Once again, this is purely a rough guide – if your beardie really likes to eat, you can still feed every day/every other day (even in older age).\nIt is also important to keep in mind that dragons can be highly sensitive to changes in their diet, so as you’re shifting from the younger dragon’s diet to a diet more suitable for an older dragon, your dragon may not eat for a couple days. This isn’t detrimental to their health in any way, and can actually be quite common. If this is the case for your dragon, experts recommend giving your dragon a warm soak.\nAvoided Food-Related Health Issues\nMuch like the body of a human, the body of a bearded dragon can suffer from many diseases and ailments (such as liver failure, gout, cancer, or even periodontitis aka gum disease). Keeping their diets rich in nutritious alkaline foods (fresh greens and vegetables) will help keep your bearded dragon in optimal health.\nAs we have stated a few times above, it is also be beneficial to include a calcium supplement and a multivitamin to their meals – these can help strengthen their skeletal structure, prevent Metabolic Bone Disease, and improve their nervous system.\nBearded Dragons tend to be aggressive eaters and may consume dangerous/large objects, so it is your responsibility to make sure any potentially hazardous materials are kept out of reach of your pet.\nThe Importance of Calcium and Multivitamin Supplements\nIt is equally important to supplement your dragon’s diet as it is to get their diet right in the first place. Sprinkling their insects with a high quality calcium supplement such as Repashy’s SuperCal HyD or Nutrobal will be beneficial to their diets.\nYou may find that lightly misting the insects with water first will help the powder stick a little better. Including a multivitamin like Repashy’s Supervite a few times a week will provide the perfect nutritional boost to their meals.\nSoaking Your Bearded Dragon\nSoaking your dragon in warm water for just 10-15 minutes will help them to stay hydrated and relaxed. In addition, these quick soaks will also keep their digestive system running smoothly and help relieve constipation.\nRemember – Dry your bearded dragon thoroughly when they’ve finished their soak. Not drying your bearded dragon thoroughly can mess with humidity levels in your tank (which is something that you definitely want to avoid).\nHelpful Feeding Tips\nGetting your Bearded Dragon to eat isn’t always easy! Even if you have the perfect foods prepared, there’s a chance that your bearded dragon may be a bit stubborn. Here are some great feeding tips to keep in mind:\n1. Dizzy the insects before feeding\nWhen feeding baby bearded dragons, it is recommended that you dizzy the insects before feeding them to your pet. To do this, just recycle an old container (maybe a tubular cardboard oatmeal box or a large Ziploc baggie), toss the live feeder insects into this container with a dusting of calcium powder, and give them a little shake for a few seconds.\nKeep in mind that the insects should still be alive when you feed them to your dragon (so try not to shake them too hard).\nThis practice makes the insects much easier to catch, which can be very helpful for clumsy baby beardies.\n2. Control the portions\nAlso important when feeding your bearded dragon their insects is to limit the portions of insects. Only feed as much as your bearded dragon can eat in 5-10 minutes\nAt meal time, your bearded dragon should eat all live insects in a single setting. Don’t let a ton of insects swarm around your tank!\n3. Prepare foods correctly\nThere are some fruits and veggies that will require a little extra preparation before being fed to your bearded dragon. Taking the peels off vegetables or cutting them down into more manageable bite-sized pieces should make them safer and easier to eat. You really only need to do this if the peels are really tough/hard to digest.\n4. Moderation and diversification are key\nWhen building your bearded dragon’s meal plan, it is also important to remember to feed them everything in moderation. Rather than offering the same salad mix every single day, try alternating with an assortment of different veggies every couple weeks. This will get them used to eating different foods and help them adapt to other changes within their tank.\nAlso, in diversifying their vegetables, you will help your bearded dragon receive a good balance of all the necessary vitamins. Too much of one vegetable and not enough of certain others might lead to hyper or hypo-vitaminosis (which is a condition that occurs when dragons get too many or too few vitamins). Rotating their veggies will keep their vitamin intake at the right levels.\n5. Make greens more appealing\nAnother good feeding practice is keeping your bearded dragon’s meals full of fresh greens. Dried, bagged, or preserved foods lack the necessary nourishment to satisfy the dietary needs of your pet.\nIt is key that your greens are fresh – fresh and organic produce will help your bearded dragon receive the best percentage and concentration of essential vitamins, minerals, and key nutrients that are required to build up both their immune system (for fighting off infections) and their digestive system (which will effectively eliminate waste). The failure of either of these systems could result in disease, parasites, or other deteriorating health conditions (so it’s vital that you help your bearded dragon keep them up and running).\nTo make sure salads are appealing to your dragon, it can be a good idea to add different colors and textures to the mix. Fresh chopped green beans, Konnayu (purple yams), or shaved butternut squash can provide a colorful assortment and varied texture to their meal. If your dragon hasn’t been eating, it is also okay to drop in a few worms to coax your pet back into a more regularly timed feeding schedule.\nThings To Know About Feeder Insects\nEvery variety of feeder insects requires different care and handling. Consulting with your supplier will give you the opportunity to learn all you need to know about important aspects of the insects’ care (like the storage requirements of whichever type you’re working with). It is also necessary that you feed your bearded dragon live, “gut loaded” feeder insects.\n“Gut-loading” is the technical term referring to the process of feeding your insects in a healthy way so that your dragon can reap the dietary benefits (since your bearded dragon is essentially eating whatever your feeder insects are eating). Make sure to ask about the supplier of your feeder insects and the source of the food they have been/are eating.\nDepending on where you and your bearded dragon are located, the availability for specific types of insects can vary widely.\nIn Florida, for example, Dubia Roaches illegal to own. In Canada, you’ll run into the same problem, though both Canada and Florida should still allow the purchase of Discoid Roaches (a good alternative).\nTo find out more about what is offered in your community, just check with your local breeder or a reptile store in the area and ask if there are any restrictions or available alternatives that you should be aware of.\nCommon Feeding Mistakes\nHere are a few common mistakes that owners make when feeding their new bearded dragon:\nOnly Feeding Crickets\nWhile it is very common among bearded dragon owners to feed their pets crickets as a staple insect, they usually aren’t the absolute best option. Uneaten crickets can be loud, a bit smelly, and can potentially try to bite/chew on your bearded dragon if left in the cage.\nRoaches are the nutritionally superior option and usually far less likely to carry parasites (a single roach nymph is the equivalent of two crickets). Crickets should only be used as a staple if nothing else is available to you for the time being (or if your dragon is an especially picky eater).\nOnly Feeding Mealworms\nAnother common mistake is feeding bearded dragons mealworms as their staple insect. These worms are simply empty calories for your bearded dragon and can be difficult to digest with their hard outer shells. Overall, mealworms are not worth the time or effort it would take your bearded dragon to consume them.\nUsing The Wrong Substrate\nBearded dragons can accidentally ingest some of the substrate around the food they’re eating. It is more often a problem for younger bearded dragons, so it is not recommended that owners feed their smaller dragons in tanks with loose substrate (like sand).\nIf consumed, substrate can cause a build-up inside your pet because it can’t be digested (otherwise known as impaction). This often leads to a blockage that can be fatal. Older bearded dragons are usually more accurate eaters, but it is still recommended to use a safe substrate.']	['<urn:uuid:f1674016-11eb-4790-b5a4-a9e101b5e672>', '<urn:uuid:d313b761-6383-440b-b1ca-7be9cf8c56c1>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	9	67	3380

True to his own circuit bending philosophy, Ben Grosser uses software to “destroy” our current perception of social media. He does that with everything – music, computers, machines. And through this, he completely changes our perception of a certain system.\nBen Grosser started as a music composer. But he is also a coder, scientist and artist.

In the context, he was focusing on questions regarding humanoids versus robots, and whether empathy is a human feature. But the philosophy of it is hauntingly beautiful: What do machines dream? What do they see? What do they feel? In the same mannerism, Grosser treats technology and software as living beings, focusing on the loop of how they affect us, but also of how we affect them. In his Computers Watching Movies, he analyzes what ‘a computational system sees when it watches the same films that we do. The work illustrates this vision as a series of temporal sketches, where the sketching process is presented in synchronized time with the audio from the original clip’. The code created by Grosser gives the system a certain degree of preference, allowing it to decide what it wants or does not want to watch. He uses a rather exotic mix of six movies (2001: A Space Odyssey, American Beauty, Inception, Taxi Driver, The Matrix, and Annie Hall) as input, true to his mix-approach ideology.\nThis multidisciplinary, intermixed approach of Ben Grosser was inspired by his job at the Beckman Institute. Thus, Interactive Robotic Painting Machine was born. Through the use of AI, a robot paints unplanned pictures, making us question if it paints for us or for itself. Some of the pieces have a specific audio input, which tells the robot if the human is satisfied or not with what the machine is doing, thus altering the real-time process. However, Grosser personally likes more the freestyle paintings, proving that ‘a constant critique of one’s creative process may not be productive’. The installation has also deviated into Head Swap, in which the loop is between the machine and violin player Benjamin Sung.\nHuman, machine. Action, reaction. Software, anti-software. Not being part of any particular field, be it musical, academical or scientific, but having the knowledge to operate in all, Ben Grosser has the capacity of offering an egalitarian approach. He does not fully belong anywhere but is bridging the gap between all of these contemporary postures. Ben Grosser’s work appeals to the most subtle of elements – perception. The computer experiences your world as much as you experience its world. And Ben Grosser proves that there is a soul in each machine, be it humanoid or robotic. Shouldn’t come much as a surprise that Interactive Robotic Painting Machine is credited as an artist. Because, after all, what is an artist if not the one making art?\nWords by Lidia Ratoi\nYou are an artist and researcher interested in the sociopolitical effects of software in current societies. You have a background in New media and music composition, and you were also the director of Imaging Technology Group at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology. For our audience that’s not familiar with your work, how and when did all these interests come about?\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I see it as a slow merging of varied interests into a singular practice. My early focus on music composition oriented me to focus on systems: systems of making, systems of listening, systems of composing. This focus was intertwined with a modernist desire to destroy and remake whatever system I could identify, and my primary method was computer music. I wanted to write software that would generate sounds we hadn’t yet heard, that not just avoided but abandoned previous conceptions of what sound could—or should—be.\nAs I started my doctorate in music, I also started working part-time at Beckman, getting involved with what at that time (the mid-’90s) were new and esoteric technologies, including high-res digital video and photography, 3D printing, and 3D animation. Within a year, I had quit the doctorate and was working full-time at Beckman, focused on digital imaging, visualization, and software development for remote instrumentation. Eventually, I started collaborating with some of the faculty, developing varied projects ranging from automated artificial bone implant design to virtual microscopy. But despite the science focus of my group and projects, I never lost my interest in the arts. I brought artists in for talks. I encouraged artists on campus to use our labs. I setup exploratory conversations between artists and scientists, and spent a couple of years pushing the Institute to establish a new research theme focused on Art & Technology. But in the end, that push was unsuccessful, and I found myself wanting to steer my own work in new directions.\nSo I left the Institute to return to art, but I brought Beckman’s focus on multidisciplinarity with me. I spent a year building and coding an artificially intelligent painting robot  that listened to and sonically contributed to its environment; in a way, it was a hybrid of my past work on computer music and composition, my Beckman work on computer-controlled hardware, and my overall focus on remaking systems. I then went back to school for an MFA in New Media. This period collided with the broad emergence of software as the dominant force in contemporary society—for search, social media, smartphones, and more—and helped me turn all of my attention to examining—through a practice-based artistic research methodology—the effects of this shift. Now my practice includes net art, computational video, AI-controlled robotics, sound art, interactive installation, theoretical writing, and online discourse (such as this interview).\nYour most recent project, Twitter Demetricator, follows the Demetricator series which aims to detach us from the constant enticement that social media metrics pose (likes, followers, retweets…). What has been the most significant findings of the use of these tools?\nSome of the common themes with Demetricator are that its removal of visible numbers from social media platforms blunts feelings of competition (e.g. between a user and their friends), removes compulsive behaviors (e.g. stops users from feeling a need to constantly checking for new notifications), and overall, reveals to users just how focused they have been on what the metrics say. When we see how many “likes” our last post received, we can’t help but take that into account when we write our next post. In other words, the metrics are guiding and changing what we say, how we say it, and who we say it to.\nBut perhaps most interestingly, Demetricator has also helped users to realize that they craft explicit rules for themselves about how to act (and not act) based on what the numbers say. For example, multiple Facebook users have shared with me that it turns out they have a rule for themselves about not liking a post if it has too many likes already (say, 25 or 50). But they weren’t aware of this rule until Demetricator removed the like counts. All of the sudden, they felt frozen, unable to react to a post without toggling Demetricator off to check! If your readers are interested in more stories like this, I have detailed many of them in a paper about\nDemetricator and Facebook metrics called “What Do Metrics Want: How Quantification Prescribes Social Interaction on Facebook”, published in the journal Computational Culture. And a couple recent accounts by journalists using Twitter Demetricator are worth reading as well, one in The New Yorker , and the other in Slate .\nWhat are the biggest challenges (technical or conceptual) you face for the development of your projects?\nTechnically, my biggest challenge is that the experiments I want to conduct and/or the changes I want to make to existing software systems are unsanctioned ones, and thus require adaptive roundabout strategies. For example, I tend to think of my Facebook Demetricator not just as an artwork, but also as a long-term code-based performance project. Facebook doesn’t want me hiding their metrics, and so doing so against their wishes through browser extensions means I have to constantly react to the changes they make. Code that hides the “like” metrics today may not work tomorrow, and, more frustratingly, code that hides your “like” count may not hide mine! This is because Facebook has many variant codebases in the field at any moment. In other words, your Facebook may not be my Facebook. So keeping this project going is an ongoing challenge. Further, this method of working, which I have come to refer to as “software recomposition,” means that every new work I make is adding to an ever-increasing pile of technical projects that need to be maintained (or abandoned). I work hard to keep everything active for as long as I can.\nCould you tell us a bit more on the latest developments of your research on artificially-intelligent creative systems?\nI’m currently completing a new work called Autonomous Video Artist (or AVA for short). AVA is an artificially-intelligent, self-navigating, video-capture robot that seeks out, records, edits, and uploads its own video art to the web. AVA is an outside observer that not only looks at our world but attempts to decode it as an artist. But different than human artists, AVA hasn’t spent years watching videos or learning how artists convey narrative using temporal media. Instead, AVA starts from the beginning, using an iterative process of making to develop its own ideas of what video art can be. Most importantly, AVA sees the world differently than we do. I hope this difference will help uncover how culture directs what humans see and don’t see, showing us at least some of the ways that human vision has become automated—or “machinic”—through culture.\nOf all the newest advancements in art created by intelligent software/machines (different pioneering work and projects from Magenta, Google’s IAM: from AI generated poetry, music and artworks (my artificial muse…), how do you predict they are going to impact in our future societies?\nWell, I wouldn’t necessarily lump everything in your list together as equally influential. But in general, I hope that these types of projects will help us to see—and thus, understand—how social, cultural, technical, and political systems are changing who we are and what we do. In other words, I hope these systems generate more questions than answers. What does it mean for human creativity when a computer can make its own art? How does machine vision differ from human vision, and what does that difference reveal about our own culturally-developed ways of looking? Why are we worried when we see a physically-embodied AI-controlled software system making a painting but not so worried when we see non-physically-embodied AI-controlled software systems (such as Google or Facebook) reconfiguring how we find information or with whom we call a “friend?”\nReferring to your work at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, How working in a scientific institution I imagine, jointly with scientists, shaped or influenced your artistic practice?\nThis is hard to answer. Artists often see my methods as at least somewhat scientific. Scientists are often frustrated that my methods aren’t more scientific, and see them instead as artistic. So perhaps the primary influence of my varied interactions is that I don’t fit in one place, and thus nobody quite knows where to put me.\nWhat is your chief enemy of creativity?\nYou couldn’t live without…\nMy spouse. My laptop. The internet. Coffee.\n https://bengrosser.com/projects/interactive-robotic-painting-machine/,  http://computationalculture.net/what-do-metrics-want/,  https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/escaping-twitters-self-consciousness-machine,  https://slate.com/technology/2018/03/the-demetricator-will-change-how-you-think-about-twitter-and-facebook.html\n(All media courtesy of the artist)', '1. The Impact of AI in our Society\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our daily lives. From voice assistants to autonomous vehicles, AI technology has the potential to transform various industries and enhance efficiency. However, as AI continues to advance, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications associated with its development and utilization.\nOne major concern is the potential bias embedded in AI algorithms. AI systems are often trained on large datasets that reflect the biases and prejudices present in society. This can lead to discrimination and unfair decision-making, as AI systems may inadvertently perpetuate existing social inequalities. It is essential for developers to address these biases and ensure that AI systems are designed to be inclusive and unbiased.\nAdditionally, the impact of AI on the job market cannot be overlooked. As AI technology automates certain tasks, there is a risk of job displacement for many individuals. It is crucial to prioritize re-education and training programs to equip workers with the skills needed for the future job market. Ethical considerations should be given to the potential social and economic disruptions caused by AI.\n2. Privacy and Data Protection\nThe development of AI relies heavily on data, often collected from individuals. As AI systems gather and analyze vast amounts of personal information, it raises concerns about privacy and data protection. Stricter regulations should be implemented to safeguard individuals’ data and ensure transparency in how it is collected, stored, and used.\nFurthermore, AI systems that process personal data may generate new insights and predictions about individuals. This raises concerns about the potential misuse of personal information and the potential for discrimination. It is crucial for developers to prioritize privacy by design, implementing measures such as data encryption and anonymization to protect individuals’ identities and prevent unauthorized access.\n3. Responsible AI Development\nResponsible AI development requires developers to consider the potential risks and unintended consequences of their creations. AI systems should be transparent, explainable, and accountable for their decisions. This means that developers must ensure that AI systems can provide clear explanations for their outcomes and that they can be held accountable in cases of unintended harm or errors.\nAnother important aspect of responsible AI development is ensuring the safety and security of AI systems. With the increasing integration of AI into critical infrastructure such as healthcare and transportation, any vulnerabilities in AI systems can have severe consequences. Developers must prioritize robust cybersecurity measures to protect against potential attacks and unauthorized access.\n4. Social Impact of AI\nAI technology has the potential to shape our society in profound ways. It is essential to consider the ethical implications of AI in areas such as surveillance, weaponization, and autonomous decision-making. The use of AI in surveillance raises concerns about privacy and civil liberties, with the potential for mass surveillance and constant monitoring. Development and deployment of AI-powered weapons raise questions about the ethics of autonomous killing.\nMoreover, the use of AI in decision-making processes, such as determining creditworthiness or criminal sentencing, raises concerns about transparency and fairness. It is crucial to ensure that AI systems do not contribute to bias or discrimination and that there is transparency in how decisions are made.\n5. Collaboration and Ethical Guidelines\nAddressing ethical considerations in AI development requires collaboration among various stakeholders, including policymakers, researchers, ethicists, and technologists. It is important to establish ethical guidelines and frameworks to guide the development and deployment of AI systems. These guidelines should address issues such as algorithmic bias, privacy, and accountability.\nFurthermore, collaboration between academia, industry, and government is crucial to ensure that AI development is aligned with societal values and needs. Ongoing dialogue and interdisciplinary research can help navigate the ethical challenges posed by AI and mitigate potential risks.

For Nephrops stock assessment, safety measures include maintaining tow speeds below 1 knot to prevent sediment disturbance, using flotation devices for camera cables, and employing both UWTV and SCUBA diving techniques for verification. Similarly, cave mapping safety protocols involve using proper protective gear, planning emergency routes, and employing specialized equipment for underwater cave mapping. Both fields require careful integration of multiple data collection methods - from traditional measurements to advanced technology - while ensuring explorer safety through proper equipment and careful navigation of challenging underwater environments.	['|Publications | Institutes | Persons | Datasets | Projects | Maps|\n1995 EC Study Contract Clyde Sea Nephrops Stock Assessment Study\nUK National Biodiversity Network, University Marine Biological Station Millport - 1995 EC Study Contract Clyde Sea Nephrops Stock Assessment Study.\nContact: Gilbertson, Paul\nAvailability: This dataset is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\nThe research project was carried out to determine whether precision stock assessment of Nephrops norvegicus can be performed by using a sledge-mounted underwater television (UWTV). This can be achieved by a method of counting the number of Nephrops burrows within a fishery ground, as established by the Scottish Office Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries Department, Aberdeen. more\nNephrops stock is estimated via prior knowledge of the sea bed and of Nephrops grounds. Burrow counts viewed by means of UWTV aids in the process of establishing the number of burrows, and therefore stock, of the whole fishery ground. The number of Nephrops burrow counts is converted to biomass with the incorporation of empty burrows recognized. This method of stock assessment is reliable, however accurate Nephrops burrow identification and counts are required. There must also be a realistic count of unoccupied burrows for the stock assessment to be precise. The report investigates Nephrops burrow morphology for identification purposes during counts. Resin casts of Nephrops burrows were obtained from a sea loch site and from previous collections held at the University Marine Biological Station Millport (UMBSM) and the Scottish Office Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries Department (SOAEFD). Burrow temporal morphology was investigated using SCUBA diver observations at two sea loch sites. In situ studies of Nephrops populations were undertaken at two Scottish (west coast) study areas, Loch Sween and Loch Riddon, by means of SCUBA diving. Two study sites in Loch Sween were established for mapping purposes. Nephrops populations were also examined by observing videotape footage obtained in Scottish, Swedish and Mediterranean waters obtained by UWTV. Data recorded, by DANI (Department of Agriculture, Northern Ireland), from the Irish Sea also supplemented the research project. A third study site, in the Achnamara arm of Loch Sween, was set up for the purpose of burrow resin casting. Resin casts of Nephrops burrows were examined and collated to determine the complexity of burrows. Burrow dynamics and longevity were examined. The Loch Riddon study site was utilized for mapping and resin casting purposes. The report also investigated the burrows of other co-inhabiting species. A key is provided to aid in the identification of species burrows based on the observations of surface features. This would prove valid for those wishing to use the UWTV-based stock assessment method as precision counts of only Nephrops burrows would be achieved. Ground suitability for UWTV based stock assessment for Nephrops is discussed. Recommendations for the UWTV method of stock assessment is provided. This study was conducted by scientists at the University Marine Biological Station Millport (UMBSM) and the Institute of Marine Biology of Crete (IMBC). Research consultation was established with members of the Scottish Office Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries Department (SOAEFD), the Istituto di Ricerche sulla Pesca Marittima, Ancona, Italy (IRPEM) and the Institute of Marine Research, Lysekil, Sweden (IMRL). The Department of Agriculture, Northern Ireland (DANI) provided the project with data. The study project has been supported by financial assistance of the European Commission. The report does not necessarily reflect the views of the European Commission. The study project is in support of the Common Fisheries Policy. The Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus, is a commercially important shellfish species in Scotland and in the rest of Europe. Stock assessment within fisheries relies on the data presented by the fishery which is supplemented by commercial and research vessel catches. Such methods of stock assessment are not entirely reliable as catch estimates vary with the seks and size of the animal, time of day, season and sediment type of the ground. A more reliable, precise method of stock assessment is required. Such a method was devised by SOAEFD and has been adopted by other institutions. The method is based on estimating the number of Nephrops within a fishery ground by counting the occupied burrows. This is achieved by the use of underwater television (UWTV). The method relies heavily on the accurate identification and recognition of Nephrops burrows. Nephrops burrows were cast in resin during the project to enable an insight into burrow morphology, complexity and diversity. One hundred and forty eight resin casts were investigated, which included new casts and those previously collected by UMBSM and SOAEFD. UWTV video tape and still photographs displaying Nephrops burrows and fishing grounds from the UK and Europe were analyzed. The colour cameras used in Scottish investigations were Simrad Osprey OE1362 and OE1364. Both cameras had a fixed focal lens and a wide field of view. A flotation device was attached to the camera cable and the tow reached a speed of less than 1 knot to prevent sediment disturbance. An underwater stills camera, supplied by SOAEFD, was occasionally used in conjunction with the UWTV. A Hasselblad 70mm underwater stills camera, equipped with a 50mm lens, 70 frame film magazine and twin strobe flashes (Simrad Osprey) was used. Both cameras were aligned to view the same area. Particular Nephrops grounds were examined for their suitability to use UWTV as a method of stock assessment. Over populated areas and those which included conspicuous species burrows suggested a high error rate for stock assessment and extra care must be utilised when assessing such Nephrops grounds. Larger burrows were identified as being only partially visible to the UWTV camera. By using divers to assess Nephrops burrows along a previously UWTV tow path, exact numbers could be counted. It was identified that not all burrows could be observed on the corresponding video tape. Allowances into partially sighted burrows and occupancy assessments had to be established for stock assessments to be as precise as possible and not over estimated. UWTV research within Scottish sites was carried out using the UMBSM research vessel RV Aora. The two project partners, UMBSM and IMBC, investigated methods of stock assessment in Nephrops grounds in the Scottish west coast and the Aegean respectively. Loch Sween and Loch Riddon (both in western Argyll) were sites investigated in Scotland. Both are sea lochs which have Nephrops grounds. Loch Sween has a varying and dense range of burrowing megafauna which was useful in establishing the problems for UWTV stock assessments.

These tools can help in creating detailed maps with annotations, labels, and various layers.\n- Drones: Drones equipped with cameras can provide aerial views of cave entrances and surrounding terrain. This can aid in creating maps that show the cave’s relationship to its environment.\n- Underground GPS and Navigation: Some cave exploration teams use specialized GPS devices designed for underground use. These devices work by sending signals through the cave passages to help explorers navigate and gather accurate location data.\n- Lighting and Photography Equipment: Good lighting is essential for capturing clear photographs and surveying cave interiors. High-quality cameras with low-light capabilities are used to document cave formations and passages.\n- Protective Gear and Safety Equipment: While not technology per se, safety equipment such as helmets, harnesses, and proper clothing are critical for cave exploration, as they ensure the safety of the surveyors.\nThe choice of technologies and tools depends on the complexity of the cave system, the level of detail required in the mapping process, and the available resources. Often, a combination of traditional and modern methods is used to produce comprehensive and accurate cave maps and plans.\nWhat methods are preferred for data collection during cave explorations?\nCave explorations require careful data collection to accurately map and understand the cave systems. The preferred methods for data collection can vary based on the specific goals of the exploration, the complexity of the cave, available technology, and safety considerations. Here are some commonly preferred methods for data collection during cave explorations:\n- Survey Stations and Tape Measurement: This involves setting up survey stations at key points in the cave and using tape measurements to determine distances, angles, and elevations between stations. Traditional compasses and clinometers are often used to measure angles and inclinations.\n- Total Stations and Theodolites: These instruments are used to measure angles and distances more accurately than manual methods.

Underground GPS devices that communicate through the cave system’s rock can help with navigation and geolocation.\n- Drones: Aerial drones equipped with cameras can provide a bird’s-eye view of cave entrances and terrain, aiding in mapping and understanding the cave’s geographical context.\n- Notebooks and Sketching: Traditional field notebooks and sketching are still valuable methods for recording observations, sketches, and notes about cave formations, passages, and features.\n- Underground Instruments: Instruments specifically designed for underground use, such as clinometers with built-in compasses, can help gather accurate measurements while navigating through tight passages.\n- Data Loggers and Sensors: Data loggers and sensors can be used to monitor environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and airflow within the cave, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the cave ecosystem.\n- Safety and Exploration Gear: Exploration teams must be equipped with proper safety gear, including helmets, harnesses, and adequate lighting to facilitate data collection in challenging cave environments.\nThe choice of methods depends on the specific needs of the exploration and the available resources. Often, a combination of methods is used to ensure accurate and comprehensive data collection, leading to more precise cave maps and a better understanding of the cave system’s characteristics. Safety is always a paramount consideration during cave explorations, so methods that minimize risks to explorers are typically favored.\nWhich specialized techniques are employed to map the intricate structure of cave systems?\nMapping the intricate structure of cave systems requires specialized techniques that can capture the complex geometry, features, and formations found within caves. Here are some specialized techniques employed for mapping intricate cave systems:\n- 3D Laser Scanning: 3D laser scanners emit laser beams that bounce off cave surfaces and return to the scanner, creating a highly detailed point cloud of the cave’s interior. This method captures the intricate shapes of cave passages, formations, and features with high accuracy. The point cloud data can be processed to generate 3D models and maps.\n- Photogrammetry: Using overlapping photographs taken from different angles, photogrammetry software can reconstruct 3D models of cave interiors. This technique is especially effective for capturing the fine details of cave formations and irregular surfaces.\n- Reflective Targets: Placing reflective targets in strategic locations within the cave allows laser rangefinders or total stations to measure distances more accurately. These targets bounce the measurement signal back to the instrument, enhancing precision in data collection.\n- Structure from Motion (SfM): Similar to photogrammetry, SfM involves capturing a series of images from various angles and using software to create 3D models. This technique is particularly useful for mapping cave passages and formations that may not be easily accessible.\n- Multi-Station Traverse Surveys: In complex cave systems, multi-station traverse surveys involve setting up multiple survey stations and measuring angles and distances from each station to others. This method is used to capture intricate networks of passages and connections.\n- Loop Closure Surveys: Loop closure surveys involve returning to previously surveyed points and ensuring that the measurements form a closed loop. This technique helps identify errors in the survey data and ensures accuracy in the mapping process.\n- Cave Diving Mapping: In underwater cave systems, cave divers use specialized equipment to map passages, formations, and features. Techniques like line laying and reel-based measurements help create accurate underwater cave maps.\n- Underground GPS and Wireless Communication: Underground GPS technology and wireless communication systems can help locate survey stations accurately, even in challenging cave environments. This aids in maintaining consistent reference points for mapping.\n- Integration of Sensor Data: Integrating data from various sensors, such as environmental sensors, water flow sensors, and magnetometers, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of cave systems, their hydrology, and potential connections.\n- Data Fusion and Visualization: Combining data from different sources, such as laser scans, photographs, and traditional survey measurements, can lead to more detailed and accurate maps. Advanced visualization tools can help researchers and explorers understand the complex structure more effectively.\n- Modeling of Complex Formations: Specialized software can be used to model and map intricate formations like speleothems (cave formations like stalactites and stalagmites). This requires careful measurement and data processing to accurately represent their shapes.\nMapping intricate cave systems often involves a combination of these techniques to capture the diverse features and complexities present within the cave. The goal is to produce detailed, accurate, and informative maps that contribute to scientific understanding and safe exploration.\nHow are cave maps used not only for scientific research but also for cave safety?\nCave maps serve multiple crucial purposes, ranging from scientific research to cave safety and management. Here’s how cave maps are used in both aspects:\n- Geological and Hydrological Studies: Cave maps provide valuable insights into the geological and hydrological characteristics of cave systems. Scientists can study the relationships between cave passages, formations, and the flow of water, which contributes to a better understanding of the underground environment.\n- Biodiversity Studies: Cave ecosystems are unique and often support specialized flora and fauna. Cave maps aid researchers in identifying potential habitats, niches, and connections that support cave-dwelling organisms. This information is vital for conservation efforts.\n- Climate and Paleoclimate Research: Studying the mineral deposits, sediment layers, and formations in caves can reveal historical climate data. Cave maps help scientists reconstruct past climate conditions and understand climate variability.\n- Speleogenesis Studies: Speleogenesis refers to the formation and development of caves. Detailed cave maps enable researchers to analyze how different processes, such as erosion, dissolution, and sedimentation, contribute to the cave’s formation.\n- Karst Landscape Studies: Cave maps are integral to studying karst landscapes, which are characterized by sinkholes, underground drainage systems, and cave networks. Understanding these landscapes helps geologists, hydrologists, and ecologists manage resources and mitigate hazards.\n- Navigation and Exploration: Cave maps are essential for safely navigating complex cave systems. Explorers and cavers use maps to plan routes, avoid getting lost, and ensure they can find their way back to the entrance. This is especially crucial in large, intricate caves.\n- Emergency Preparedness: In case of accidents, cave maps aid rescue teams in locating and accessing cavers quickly and efficiently. Detailed maps can include information about potential hazards, escape routes, and access points.\n- Risk Assessment: Cave maps help assess potential risks associated with specific cave passages, such as unstable formations, tight squeezes, or flooded areas. This information is important for determining which areas are safe to explore and which require specialized equipment or training.\n- Conservation and Protection: Cave maps aid in identifying areas of ecological sensitivity. By knowing where fragile formations or sensitive habitats exist, cave managers and explorers can take measures to minimize their impact and protect the cave’s unique features.\n- Resource Management: For caves with commercial or recreational use, maps are essential for managing visitor traffic, preventing overcrowding, and maintaining a sustainable balance between exploration and conservation.\n- Access Control: Cave maps can be used to manage access to sensitive or fragile areas within caves. By restricting access to certain passages, cave managers can prevent accidental damage and preserve the cave’s natural state.\nIn essence, cave maps are indispensable tools that serve not only as scientific records but also as critical resources for safe exploration, conservation, and management of cave systems. They help strike a balance between the need for scientific understanding and the imperative to protect these fragile and unique underground environments.\nWhat are the challenges and limitations encountered in the process of cave mapping?\nThe process of cave mapping is complex and often fraught with challenges and limitations due to the unique nature of cave environments and the technical difficulties involved. Some of the key challenges and limitations encountered in the process of cave mapping include:\n- Inaccessible Areas: Many cave systems contain passages that are too narrow, too flooded, or otherwise inaccessible to human explorers. Mapping such areas requires specialized equipment and techniques, such as remote-operated vehicles (ROVs) or cave diving, which come with their own set of challenges.\n- Navigation Difficulties: Navigating through the labyrinthine passages of a cave can be extremely challenging, leading to confusion and the potential for getting lost. This challenge is compounded in large, complex cave systems.\n- Limited Visibility: Many caves are completely dark or have limited natural light, making it difficult to accurately measure distances, angles, and features. Explorers rely on artificial lighting, which may not provide consistent or adequate illumination for precise mapping.\n- Technical Equipment Limitations: The use of technical equipment like laser scanners, total stations, and cameras can be hindered by factors such as battery life, signal interference, and the need for specialized training to operate these tools effectively.\n- Data Integration: Combining data from different sources, such as laser scans, photographs, and traditional survey measurements, can be challenging. Ensuring data accuracy and alignment during integration is critical for creating coherent and accurate cave maps.\n- Time-Consuming Process: Mapping intricate cave systems is time-consuming and requires meticulous attention to detail. This can lead to extended fieldwork periods, especially when mapping large or complex caves.\n- Survey Errors: Even with advanced equipment, errors can occur during the survey process. Small inaccuracies in measurements, misalignment of instruments, or surveying mistakes can lead to distorted maps and inaccurate representations.\n- Environmental Considerations: Caves often harbor delicate formations that can be damaged by human presence. Surveyors need to take great care not to disrupt these formations while collecting data, which can slow down the mapping process.\n- Scale and Perspective: Translating the three-dimensional reality of caves onto two-dimensional maps can distort scale and perspective. This can make it challenging to accurately represent the true dimensions and relationships within the cave.\n- Lack of Reference Points: In the absence of clear reference points like geographic landmarks, mapping cave systems can be more challenging. Establishing reliable reference points for accurate positioning can be difficult, especially in remote areas.\n- Communication Challenges: In caves with limited or no wireless communication, transmitting data in real-time can be problematic. This can hinder the ability to receive guidance or assistance from experts outside the cave.\n- Safety Concerns: The safety of cave explorers is paramount. Technical challenges and the potential for unexpected hazards, such as cave-ins or flooding, can pose risks to surveyors and limit their ability to thoroughly explore and map certain areas.\nDespite these challenges, advancements in technology and surveying techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and comprehensiveness of cave mapping. Researchers and explorers continue to develop innovative solutions to address these limitations and expand our knowledge of the intricate world beneath the surface.']	['<urn:uuid:8716a3ca-14fe-405c-b7de-c5bc5a6985bd>', '<urn:uuid:10dc5356-b30d-47ad-a829-71483faabba4>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	6	97	3649
74	I'm trying to understand why heart disease is such a big problem in America - what are the latest stats on how many people it affects, what causes it, and how can lifestyle changes help prevent it?	Heart disease is indeed a major health crisis in America, causing 1 in 4 deaths, with someone dying every 36 seconds from cardiovascular disease. Approximately 655,000 Americans die from heart disease annually, costing the US about $219 billion per year. The good news is that it's largely preventable through lifestyle modifications. Key prevention strategies include regular exercise, limited alcohol consumption, not smoking, getting 7-8 hours of sleep nightly, and maintaining a healthy weight. Social connections also play a vital role - studies show people with strong social networks and supportive marriages have lower risk of heart attacks and strokes compared to socially isolated individuals.	"['These adjectives refer to a state of good physical health. Healthy stresses the absence of disease or infirmity and is used of whole organisms as well as their parts: a healthy baby; flossed daily to promote healthy gums. Wholesome suggests a state of good health associated with youthful vitality or clean living: ""In truth, a wholesome, ruddy, blooming creature she was"" (Harriet Beecher Stowe).\nJump up ^ Housman & Dorman 2005, pp. 303–304. ""The linear model supported previous findings, including regular exercise, limited alcohol consumption, abstinence from smoking, sleeping 7–8 hours a night, and maintenance of a healthy weight play an important role in promoting longevity and delaying illness and death."" Citing Wingard DL, Berkman LF, Brand RJ (1982). ""A multivariate analysis of health-related practices: a nine-year mortality follow-up of the Alameda County Study"". Am J Epidemiol. 116 (5): 765–775. PMID 7148802.\nHaving that kind of control over your heart health is particularly welcome news right now, with cardiovascular disease remaining the number-one killer of both men and women. A recent CDC report revealed that “largely preventable” heart problems killed around 415,000 Americans in 2016. Under its Million Hearts campaign—which aims to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2022—the CDC identified approximately 2.2 million hospitalizations and 415,000 deaths from heart attacks, strokes, heart failure and related conditions in 2016 that likely could have been avoided.\nOutside of that time, you can qualify for Special Enrollment Period with “qualifying life events”. Some of these events include divorce, loss of employment, income change, new dependents, or moving to a new area. You will have to prove that you had a qualifying life event, and find health insurance within a certain window of time. Shopping with the help of resources at eHealth helps make this process faster, and get you covered as soon as possible.\nHealth insurance solutions provided through USAA Life General Agency, Inc. (LGA) (known in CA and NY as USAA Health and Life Insurance Agency), which acts as an agent for select insurance companies to provide products to USAA members. LGA representatives are salaried and receive no commissions. However, LGA receives compensation from those companies, which may be based on the total quantity and quality of insurance coverage purchased through LGA. Plans not available in all states. Each company has sole financial responsibility for its own products.\nPrices are fixed by law, so you will not find better prices for the same plan anywhere else. But comparing your options might help you find low-cost health insurance. You can shop around online and use free quotes from eHealth to find providers that offer high-quality, low-cost individual and family health insurance plans. Seeing all your options could make finding low-cost health insurance easier.\nThe private health system in Australia operates on a ""community rating"" basis, whereby premiums do not vary solely because of a person\'s previous medical history, current state of health, or (generally speaking) their age (but see Lifetime Health Cover below). Balancing this are waiting periods, in particular for pre-existing conditions (usually referred to within the industry as PEA, which stands for ""pre-existing ailment""). Funds are entitled to impose a waiting period of up to 12 months on benefits for any medical condition the signs and symptoms of which existed during the six months ending on the day the person first took out insurance. They are also entitled to impose a 12-month waiting period for benefits for treatment relating to an obstetric condition, and a 2-month waiting period for all other benefits when a person first takes out private insurance. Funds have the discretion to reduce or remove such waiting periods in individual cases. They are also free not to impose them to begin with, but this would place such a fund at risk of ""adverse selection"", attracting a disproportionate number of members from other funds, or from the pool of intending members who might otherwise have joined other funds. It would also attract people with existing medical conditions, who might not otherwise have taken out insurance at all because of the denial of benefits for 12 months due to the PEA Rule. The benefits paid out for these conditions would create pressure on premiums for all the fund\'s members, causing some to drop their membership, which would lead to further rises in premiums, and a vicious cycle of higher premiums-leaving members would ensue.\nCould good interpersonal ties bolster the cardiovascular system? One study found that people who were socially isolated and lonely were more likely to have a heart attack or stroke than people with strong social networks. Being in a supportive marriage also cuts your risk heart disease, according to a 2018 study. Your relationships may actually matter more to your lifelong health than your cholesterol readings, suggest findings from the 80-year-old, ongoing Harvard Study of Adult Development. The researchers have discovered that the people who were most satisfied with their relationships at 50 were the healthiest at 80. Love, it seems, really is good for the heart.\nAll products require separate applications. Separate policies or certificates are issued. Golden Rule Short term Medical plans are medically underwritten and do not provide coverage for preexisting conditions or meet the mandated coverage necessary to avoid tax penalty under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Expiration or termination of a Short Term Medical plan does not trigger an ACA Special Enrollment opportunity. Related insurance products offered by either company may be medically underwritten—see the product brochures and applications.\nMany governments view occupational health as a social challenge and have formed public organizations to ensure the health and safety of workers. Examples of these include the British Health and Safety Executive and in the United States, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which conducts research on occupational health and safety, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which handles regulation and policy relating to worker safety and health.\nCo payments were introduced in the 1980s in an attempt to prevent over utilization. The average length of hospital stay in Germany has decreased in recent years from 14 days to 9 days, still considerably longer than average stays in the United States (5 to 6 days). Part of the difference is that the chief consideration for hospital reimbursement is the number of hospital days as opposed to procedures or diagnosis. Drug costs have increased substantially, rising nearly 60% from 1991 through 2005. Despite attempts to contain costs, overall health care expenditures rose to 10.7% of GDP in 2005, comparable to other western European nations, but substantially less than that spent in the U.S. (nearly 16% of GDP).\nA recent study by PricewaterhouseCoopers examining the drivers of rising health care costs in the U.S. pointed to increased utilization created by increased consumer demand, new treatments, and more intensive diagnostic testing, as the most significant. However, Wendell Potter, a long-time PR representative for the health insurance industry, has noted that the group which sponsored this study, AHIP, is a front-group funded by various insurance companies. People in developed countries are living longer. The population of those countries is aging, and a larger group of senior citizens requires more intensive medical care than a young, healthier population. Advances in medicine and medical technology can also increase the cost of medical treatment. Lifestyle-related factors can increase utilization and therefore insurance prices, such as: increases in obesity caused by insufficient exercise and unhealthy food choices; excessive alcohol use, smoking, and use of street drugs. Other factors noted by the PWC study included the movement to broader-access plans, higher-priced technologies, and cost-shifting from Medicaid and the uninsured to private payers.\nThe UK\'s National Health Service (NHS) is a publicly funded healthcare system that provides coverage to everyone normally resident in the UK. It is not strictly an insurance system because (a) there are no premiums collected, (b) costs are not charged at the patient level and (c) costs are not pre-paid from a pool. However, it does achieve the main aim of insurance which is to spread financial risk arising from ill-health. The costs of running the NHS (est. £104 billion in 2007-8) are met directly from general taxation. The NHS provides the majority of health care in the UK, including primary care, in-patient care, long-term health care, ophthalmology, and dentistry.\nGianos recommends following the Mediterranean diet and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. Both are rich in plants, with an emphasis on leafy greens, whole foods and plant fats like olive oil. Your eating schedule matters too. “Sticking to three balanced meals and one snack works well for optimizing energy, blood sugar and insulin regulation, digestive health and weight,” Sass says. “Time your carbs for early in the day, before your most active hours.”', 'Heart Disease Facts\nLearn more about heart disease and its risk factors.

75	As someone interested in buying a franchise, I'm concerned about making the right choice - what are the essential things I should investigate about a potential franchisor before making a commitment?	When investigating a potential franchisor, you should: obtain their financial statements, get copies of profit and loss statements from franchise locations that you select, determine if there are any franchisee lawsuits pending against the franchisor, and conduct due diligence interviews with other franchisees that you choose personally. It's important to note that talking to franchisees provided as references by the franchisor is probably the least important step. Existing franchises will normally be willing to share information about their operations' successes or shortcomings. Additionally, you shouldn't rely too heavily on 'pro forma' financial statements, as these are just estimates regarding future prospects.	"['How to buy a business or franchise\nIt is very important that you understand the business you wish to start. Appraise your experience, likes and skills to determine if that business is a good fit. In this session, you will learn how to make objective decisions when considering the purchase of a business or franchise, the pros and cons of buying a business or franchise, and how to evaluate how much you should pay.\n- How Should I Go About Buying A Business?\n- Financial ability\n- Evaluating a business\n- How to determine a business\' worth\n- Sources of business financing\n- Other factors to consider in determining value\n- How to verify revenue and receivables information\n- Buying an existing business vs. Starting a new business\n- Pros and Cons of Buying a Franchise\n- Pros and cons of buying a franchise\n- What I should know about a prospective franchiser\n- Becoming a franchiser\n- Suggested Activities\n- Visit different operations\n- Attend trade shows\n- Understand your intended business\n- Analyze any appropriate existing business\n- Analyze a franchised operation\n- Top Ten Do\'s and Don\'ts\n- Business Plan\nHow Should I Go About Buying a Business?\nFor entrepreneurs who are planning to make business acquisitions part of their growth program, we recommend reviewing session 12 ""Buying Businesses"" in our Business Expansion course.\nThis should be a step-by-step sequential process. Here are the steps:\nFIRST: Decide whether you will be buying a business to provide you with a full-time job or will be making the purchase as a part-time investment.\nSECOND: Thoroughly investigate the industry you are considering to conclude if this is really a business to which you can make a commitment.\nTHIRD: Attend industry meetings, talk to existing business owners, spend time at typical businesses and visit competitive locations to determine if those who are already in the industry share your conclusions.\nFOURTH: Decide whether you want to start a new business or buy an existing business.\nFIFTH: Investigate the advantages of buying companies in your own field. These benefits are spelled out in Session 12 of Business Expansion.\nAND FINALLY: Appraise your own experience, skills, and background and decide if this business is a good fit for you.\n- Are the economics of the business sound?\n- Is there a reasonable predictability of future growth in earnings?\n- Is there a sound financial foundation?\n- Does bad management in the business create an especially good opportunity?\n- Have the evaluations in Session One: ""How To Pick a Business"" been confirmed?\nBusiness opportunities for sale\nThere are many sources for learning about business opportunities. Here are some of the most popular:\n- Business opportunity brokers\n- Classified newspaper ads\n- Companies that supply or set up new locations\n- Business opportunity trade shows\n- A franchiser for any particular type of business\nMost people will not pay cash for a business, so some sort of financing will be involved. The equity position that will be required (the amount of cash necessary to put down) will determine the type and size of business you will be able to buy.\nDepending on the business you select, you will need sufficient operating capital in addition to the down payment.\nThe source of the equity funds should be cash or liquid assets and not borrowed money.\nEvaluating a business\nRemember that this is your decision and only you can decide whether a business is for you. Don\'t let any expert decide whether or not you should buy a business. Instead, ask them for specific advice on the various components of the business. Here are two examples of how your attorney will be an important expert:\n- Have your attorney review the lease.\n- Your attorney should advise you as to whether you should purchase the stock or the assets of the business. If there are unpaid (and possibly unknown) liabilities including amounts owed to government agencies, you may be advised to purchase the assets rather than the stock.\n- For insights into how Warren Buffett evaluated companies to buy, visit our session twelve, ""Buying Businesses"" in the Business Expansion course.\nThe following experts can be helpful:\n- Business opportunity broker\n- Equipment suppliers or vendors\n- Other business owners\nHow to determine a business\' worth\n- This is the ""due diligence"" process. A buyer must obtain and examine the seller\'s financial statement and records. If the business is listed with a broker, the broker should have this information. The information you need should include the following:\n- Profit and Loss records for the past 24-36 months\n- Current balance Sheet\n- Cash deposit records\n- Utility bills\n- Supplier bills\n- In making your offer, use all the information you have collected to determine your net income. This will give you a basis for making an offer based on a capitalization rate (the desired return) you will want. For example, if a business will show an annual net of $50,000 and you have determined you want a 25% return of your investment (without considering financing) you would offer $200,000 for the business.\nSources of business financing\n- The seller of an existing business will often provide some of the financing and will be your best source of financing. Businesses are sold by motivated sellers. In many cases, the seller will take some cash down and let you pay the rest out of earnings over a period of time.\n- The SBA (Small Business Administration) offers loan guarantee programs through commercial lenders. These will usually need to be secured by additional assets.\n- Equipment suppliers often have financing programs available for the development of a new business.\n- Venture capital firms, commercial banks, and relatives offer an additional source.\n- Review the sources in Session 4, ""Financing the Business.""\nOther factors to consider in determining value\n- Unless you are also buying the property, the lease is probably the most important document you will evaluate. Review Session 10, ""Location and Leasing."" The following are the most relevant lease items:\n- The term or length of the base lease.\n- Options to the base lease term.\n- A rent that is affordable and competitive.\n- How often and how much are the adjustments to the base rent?\n- NNN (triple net lease) charges.\n- Assignment provisions.\n- The landlord\'s contributions to the improvements, if a new business.\n- What is the quality of the improvements and fixtures: will they need replacement?\n- What is the quality and size of the inventory: is it overstocked with obsolete items?\n- What is the condition and amount of the receivables: are they collectible?\n- If I am to buy the payables, how current are they and what is the accurate total?\n- Is there an order backlog?\n- How strong are customer relationships: the goodwill you will pay for?\n- Is the primary marketplace stable or changing?\n- Does the business have, or can it obtain, all necessary government approvals and licenses? Are there any exorbitant fees?\n- Is the seller motivated or anxious?\nHow to verify revenue and receivables information\n- Ask for the seller\'s personal and business tax returns. In some businesses, you can determine the income by analyzing utility bills or supplier\'s records.\n- If you are skeptical about the information\'s accuracy, make your offer to purchase based on a trial period where both you and the owner collect the receipts.\n- The receivables of a business (amounts still owed by customers) can be best verified by requiring written verification from people who owe the business money.\n- Interview the owners of similar businesses for financial comparisons.\nBuying an existing business vs. Starting a new business\n- Is it affordable? A new business will often cost more than an existing business of the same type. An existing business may be the only way to enter the industry.\n- Location is an important factor. In some communities, certain types of business can no longer be built and an existing business will be the only way to enter the industry. Proximity to your home will also be a factor.\n- Some benefits of starting a new business:\n- Everything is new and works\n- Customers like to go to a new business\n- The area may be under-served\n- The value of the new business after you open may be greater than the cost of equipment\n- New and inventive ideas may be better executed\n- Benefits of purchasing an existing business:\n- The business has a track record of income and expenses\n- Operating costs are often lower than in a new business\n- The business will already have trained employees\n- There may be true goodwill already built in\n- The business may already dominate the market in the trade area\nPros and Cons of Buying a Franchise\n- Big Brother (franchiser has proven business formula and can offer ongoing support in all facets of the operation)\n- Risk of poor and/or unprofitable location\n- Loss of absolute control\n- Big up-front fees and ongoing fees to franchiser\nWhat should I know about a prospective franchiser?\n- Obtain the financial statement(s) of the franchiser.\n- Obtain copies of profit and loss statements on franchise locations that you select.\n- Determine whether there are any franchisee lawsuits pending against franchiser.\n- Conduct due diligence interviews with other franchisees that you select. (Probably the least important step in your ""due diligence"" investigation is talking to the franchisees that the franchiser provided as references.)\n- Existing franchises will normally be happy to share information on the success or shortcomings of their operations.\n- Don\'t rely too much on ""pro forma"" financial statements. These statements are estimates provided in advance regarding future prospects.\n- If you plan to become a franchiser (not a franchisee) Session 10 ""Franchising Your Business"" in the Business Expansion course will be of special interest.\nPros and cons of YOU becoming the franchiser of your own business (and licensing others to become your franchisees):\n- Eliminates workman\'s compensation insurance, health insurance costs, and employee-related problems\n- Rapid expansion possible over broad geographical area\n- Franchisees provide expansion capital\n- Franchisees are motivated operators\n- Loss of absolute control\n- Problems with unprofitable and/or difficult franchisees\n- Controlled by state and federal franchising statutes\n- Visit different operations, both independently owned and franchised, and interview the owners for advice.\n- Attend trade shows.\n- Get to understand your intended business really well before you decide to buy or start one.\n- Analyze any appropriate existing business that is for sale:\n- Get the necessary information from a business opportunity broker.\n- Describe your method for evaluating the business.\n- Describe your financing plan on purchasing that business.\n- Conduct the same analysis for a franchised operation. Study the term and conditions of a real franchise agreement, item by item.\nTHE TOP TEN DO\'S\n- Decide first whether to be in business full-time, part-time or with your family.\n- Thoroughly investigate the industry first. If possible, work for someone else in the business first.\n- Appraise your experience, skills and likes to determine if the business is a good fit.\n- Look to the economics of the business more than how well or poorly it has been run.\n- Look to the seller as the best source of financing when purchasing a business.\n- Pursue a structured ""due diligence"" process. Ask for help from your lawyer and accountant.\n- Verify receivables by written verification from people owing the business money.\n- Perform your own evaluation of the business\'s real estate location.\n- Deal only with established, well-financed and widely successful franchisers.\n- Determine the names of all franchisees in your area and go talk to them.\nTHE TOP TEN DON\'TS\n- Permit any expert to decide for you whether or not you should buy a business.\n- Buy a business or franchise without your lawyer approving all documents.\n- Buy a business or franchise without your accountant reviewing their records.\n- Rely on information or advice from franchise or other selling agents.\n- Rely on pro forma financial statements (future predictions.)\n- Be in a rush. (Wait patiently for the fat opportunity by looking at lots of them.)\n- Rely on the seller\'s evaluation of inventory and other assets.\n- Deal with start-up or poorly experienced and financed franchisers.\n- Hesitate to walk away from a deal that is not a potential home run.\n- Overlook comparing what you can do as an individual vs. as a franchisee.\nBusiness Plan for Session 9: Buying a Business or Franchise\nYou can continue to assemble your business plan.

77	What are the six main functions of the subtle body in Neoplatonism?	The subtle body serves six key functions: 1) Ontologically, it mediates between immaterial soul and material body, facilitating soul individualization during descent through spheres. 2) Epistemologically, it carries imagination and perception. 3) From eschatological and soteriological perspectives, it enables atonement and heavenly return. 4) Topologically, it allows soul movement in cosmos and placement beyond universe after death. 5) In theurgy, it's the focus of ritual purification practices. 6) In demonology, it's relevant as cosmic entities possess subtle features.

In the Far East it plays a decisive role in various practices ranging from medicine and sexuality to spirituality and yoga (1), but is also found in both Islamic and Jewish mysticism. In the Western tradition, the idea of the subtle body is found particularly in Neoplatonism, in the Platonism of the Renaissance and in the Cambridge Platonists, as well as in Gnostic, hermetic, alchemical and esoteric traditions. Within the framework of Christianity, the subtle body appears in the context of how resurrection is to be conceived (2). If we regard this spectrum, we get the impression that the subtle body – as G. R. S. Mead very properly remarked – is “one of the most persistent persuasions of mankind in all ages and climes” (3) and has an exceptional potential for intercultural and comparative research.\nThe English term “subtle body” was coined in modern times. It can be traced back to a specific lexical option for sūkṣmaśarīra – an important concept in the Hindu tradition – within the framework of the Theosophical Society’s translations of Sanskrit texts (4). In the terminology of Neoplatonic thought, the terms ochema (that is, vehiculum, soul-carriage) or pneuma (that is, spiritus, life-breath) are used in the sense of subtle body, since they mean the form that clothes the soul as it descends through the heavenly spheres before becoming incarnate in a material body. Another term used to speak of this subtle body is ‘astral body’, in which the composition of this body from substances of the planetary sphere is taken for granted. What role is ascribed to this body by Neoplatonic thinkers and what are the sources of such ideas? We shall now take a closer look at this question.\nIn the first place, it is convenient to distinguish six functions of the subtle body:\n1. From an ontological perspective, it is a mediation between the immaterial soul and the material body, and the descent of the soul through the spheres assumes a process of individualization.\n2. From an epistemological perspective, it mostly appears as bearer of the faculty of imagination and perception.\n3. From an eschatological and soteriological perspective, it acts as a medium to atone for wrongdoings and be able to return to the heavenly abode.\n4. From a topological perspective, it enables movement of the soul within the cosmos and its emplacement beyond this universe after death.\n5. From a theurgic point of view, it is the object of ritual practices aiming at self-purification.\n6. Within the context of Neoplatonic demonology, it has a certain relevance due to the idea that such cosmic entities are also endowed with subtle features.\nThe philosophical foundations in Plato and Aristotle, on which later notions of the subtle body are based, are easily recognizable.\n1. Plato’s use of the term ochema in his dialogues Timeaus (41e-2, 44e-2, 69c-7), Phaedrus (247b-2), Phaedo (113d-5), Epinomis (986b-5, a text long attributed to him) and Laws (898e-899a), which points to speculations on the existence of a soul-body made of light or air.\n2. Aristotle’s definition of pneuma as an entity with a structure presenting a certain analogy with cosmic elements (De Generatione Animalium, 736b-37, 38). It is from a combination of these two notions – the Platonic ochema and the Aristotelian pneuma – that later doctrines on the subtle body were built. This should not however lead us to the conclusion that all the resulting ideas about the subtle body were the fruit of a synthesis of Platonic and Aristotelian exegesis. The fact that many doctrines of the subtle body in late antiquity were elaborated in the form of commentaries does not mean that the inspiration of Neoplatonic thinkers (whose took the classical authorities as their point of departure) has to be reduced to an empty form of scholasticism. Their philosophical positions certainly cannot be fully explained by relating them exclusively to the heritage of traditional (classical) authorities. Even within the commentary tradition, the question of the relationship between ‘tradition’, ‘reason’ and ‘experience’ (5) should be thoroughly considered. This is even more ostensible in the case of Neoplatonic authors following Plotinus with regard to the axis of ‘experience’, mainly because in that case many religious and cultic elements ended up permeating the doctrinal and philosophical field. For this reason we must say that reconstructing the rise of the notion of the subtle body in the philosophical context of the Old Academy is one matter; yet another is to explain its success in Neoplatonic thought after Plotinus. Dealing with this subject exclusively on the basis of the history of ideas most probably risks excluding its experiential basis, that is, the close relationship between doctrine and life. Not by chance did Neoplatonic representations of the subtle body appear primarily in the religion of late antiquity, more precisely in the context of theurgy. The aim of theurgic practices was purification of the soul-body as a means of attaining visions of gods and the ascent of the soul to the higher spheres of heaven (6). In Plotinus such practices were not really essential, and his disciple Porphyry insisted on the primacy of philosophy over theurgy. Iamblichus however thought otherwise on this subject (7). In his opinion theurgy was the exclusive means of separating the soul from the body and of ensuring its ascension. Where do such ideas come from? Do they come mainly from philosophical discourse, from specific exegesis of authoritative texts, or from religious experience related to ritual practice? Do they have their place in the history of philosophy, or rather in the history of religion and cult? There is no doubt that they are relevant in the context of religious history, for example, if we consider the motif of the ascent and descent of the soul through the planetary spheres. It is also the product of various instances of transmission (8) and has its place in the world of archaic religions (for example in the context of Shamanism) and also in Abrahamitic monotheism (for example in the rapture of Enoch and Elijah or in Mohammed’s ascent to Heaven). In ancient philosophy this kind of conception is held mostly by followers of Plato, and it plays a role in different religious and philosophical trends of late antiquity, for example in the Chaldean Oracles, Gnosticism (Pistis Sophia), the Mysteries (of Mithras and Isis), in Hermeticism (Poimandres, Panaretos) and Alchemy (Zosimos). It is very difficult to separate the aforementioned world-visions of that period of history, since they develop (in terms of time) parallel to each other and (in terms of content) with reciprocal influences. This is also why the manifold versions of the doctrine of the subtle body prove to be a very fruitful terrain even from the perspective of history of religions and were widely discussed in the context of the topoi of heavenly ascent. We should also bear in mind that the motif of ‘stripping off the garments’ (periblêmata) (9) i.e. the different qualities relating to the body during its ascent through the celestial spheres, is closely connected with the context of the Mysteries, in which ritual correspondences may have occurred.\nIt becomes clear that the close relationship between the different conceptions of the subtle body and the complex interaction of religion and rite is a kind of red thread that enables us to grasp the whole scope of the question. Any detailed exposition will include different dimensions such as hermeneutics, religious experience and ritual practice. This can be clearly seen in Iamblichus’ work De Mysteriis Aegyptorum, Chaldaeorum, Assyriorum, a wide-scale justification of the soteriological dimension of theurgic practices. Even when Iamblichus attempts to express it in a (rationally elaborated) philosophical discourse, the effectiveness of theurgy for him is something that escapes all philosophical description or understanding and must therefore be carried out or experienced (10). In the third book, he deals thoroughly with different forms of divination and provides extensive descriptions of divine possession – defined as ‘illumination’ in the literal sense of the word:\nThis passage combines the main aspects of Iamblichus’ theory of inspiration. It is the etheric body of light enveloping the soul – which is the soul’s faculty of imagination – that plays a decisive role in ‘illumination’. In general terms, an epiphany is for Iambichus the luminous self-manifestation of a divine entity in the receptacle of the human imagination. The miraculous aspect of the epiphanic event revolves around ‘taking shape’, since that which adopts a form is something beyond all appearances. This coming-to-presentation has its location in the subtle body, since the imaginary power of the latter enables a transformation of intelligible gods into images, thus making them accessible in the realm of appearances. In this respect, Olympiodorus writes, “It is the imagination that clothes incorporeal realities in bodies” (12). And since the gods manifest themselves only according to the qualifications [epitêdeiotês]of the one receiving them, their different appearances refer to the degree of perfection of the theurgic practitioner as mirrored in his subtle body.\nSimilar elements are found in Proclus and Hermias of Alexandria. Both authors speak about the experience of daemonic or divine appearances, and the question arises as to how the gods can appear (even personified) if they are at the same time immutable in the Platonic sense of the word. For Proclus this is no exclusive contradiction, since the gods cast forth images in order to manifest themselves in the sphere of becoming. The ‘visions’ [theamata]can thus be said to depend both on the gods and on the human beings perceiving them. Proclus speaks quite explicitly of ‘seeing’ [horan], but it is indeed a special kind of vision (as confirmed by his remark concerning the ‘body of light’) of which not all human beings are capable. In fact, the qualified are those whose ‘body of light’ (as the organ of divine manifestation) is in good condition, and the kind of perception related to the divine vision seems to correspond to the faculty of imagination (13). It is this kind of perception to which Hermias also bears witness in his commentary on Phaedrus:\nWhat conclusion can we draw from what we have examined so far? Basically, that the subtle body for Neoplatonic thinkers finds its place in the descriptions and philosophical explanations of religious experiences or epiphanies, thus appearing as the vehicle of imagination, since imagination is the faculty that enables us to establish contact with the gods. With regard to the experiential foundation of this idea, it is worth mentioning the parallels G. Shaw established with Eastern doctrines:\nThis last quotation inaugurates another dimension of our inquiry, since there are surprising correspondences between the Neoplatonic doctrines of ochema and pneuma and the doctrine of the subtle body in the Arabic and Persian traditions, especially bearing in mind the relevance ascribed to the sphere of the so-called ‘imaginal’. It was Henry Corbin who undertook a thorough research into the notion of a mundus imaginalis (clearly present in Persian philosophers and mystics) as a middle-realm between the sensible and the intelligible. According to him, the mundus imaginalis is actually the very place of religious experience and its manifold elements (theophanies, visions, eschatological events, etc.), as eminently described in books like Corps spirituel et Terre céleste: de l’Iran mazdéen à l’Iran shî’ite (1979) and L’homme de lumière dans le soufisme iranien (1971). The former contains a number of source texts from the pre-Islamic and Islamic period dealing with the question of the subtle dimension of the body. The latter was defined by Corbin himself as the ‘physiology of the light-man’ and directly concerns the ‘organ’ of the subtle body. We may conclude by saying that Corbin clearly shows how a phenomenology of mysticism and visions can be traced back to a metaphysical basis founded in the subtle physiology we have referred to throughout this essay.\n(1) A significant example is S. Syman’s Story of Yoga in America, published under the title The Subtle Body (New York 2010).\n(2) St Paul (cf. Corinthians 15, 42-44) refers to a ‘pneumatic body’. At the same time the identity between the earthly and the resurrected body is explained in terms of the relationship between seed and plant. It should be noticed that Paul Deussen uses the same allegory in his Philosophie der Upanishad’s (Leipzig 1922, p. 239) in order to illustrate the doctrine of the subtle body in Vedānta.\n(3) G. R. S. Mead, The Doctrine of the Subtle Body in Western Tradition, London 1919, p. 1. This opinion is shared in the collective volume edited by G. Samuel and J. Johnston, entitled Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West. Between mind and body (London/New York 2013).\n(4) Cf. G. Samuel/J. Johnston, Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West, p. 2. It is not surprising that the idea of the subtle body has always aroused particular interest in theosophical circles, and that the only attempt to use this notion in a broader transcultural investigation was carried out by a Theosophist: J. J. Poortman, who wrote the monumental book Ochêma (original in Danish, 1954), known in English as Vehicles of Consciousness. The Concept of Hylic Pluralism, 1978.\n(5) This point is closely related to A. H. Amstrong’s question concerning Plotinus in his essay “Tradition, Reason and Experience in the Thought of Plotinus”, in: Plotino e il Neoplatonismo in Oriente e in Occidente, Roma 1976, pp. 171-194.\n(6) In his De civitate Dei (X, 9 and 27) Augustine characterized theurgy – after the fashion of Porphyry – as a purification of the ‘spiritual’ (pneumatic) part of the soul enabling the individual to “perceive spirits and angels and have vision of gods”. In this respect wrote Psellus (Commentarius, 1132a): “The Chaldeans say that we cannot be borne upwards towards god, unless we strengthen the vehicle of the soul by material sacraments”.\n(7) Cf. De mysteriis, II-11, and also Proclus, Theologia Platonica, I-25.\n(8) Cf. F. Cumont, Afterlife in Roman paganism, New Haven 1922, pp. 91-109, pp. 148-169, pp. 206-213; C.

78	four ways democratize data science analytics	According to Gartner, the four ways to democratize analytics and data for continuous intelligence are: search-driven analytics (using natural language interfaces), AI-powered insights (using AI and Machine learning for data preparation and analysis), embedded data science (using data science with analytics dashboards), and streaming analytics & data science (applying analytics on streaming data at critical business moments).	['By Apsara Rodriguez\nInvesting in machine learning and AI is becoming increasingly necessary to stay competitive in the modern marketplace. To keep up with consumer demand, it is now vital for businesses to manage the flow of data. This can be achieved by staying up to date with data analysis strategies. Recent advancements in technology have led consumers to expect a high degree of responsiveness from companies (Mulligan, 2018). The demand for “everything now” is only reasonably achieved by sifting through data and analyzing the information in real-time. Lacking quick decision-making processes, a business will struggle to attain the growth desired in a marketplace with an increasing digital presence. One analytical strategy which is capable of incorporating changes in data quickly, safely and seamlessly is known as continuous intelligence.\nWhat is Continuous Intelligence?\nAccording to Gartner, a leading research and advisory company, “Continuous intelligence is a design pattern in which real-time analytics are integrated into business operations, processing current and historical data to prescribe actions in response to business moments and other events”. In other words, CI is a way for systems to know what’s happening in real time.\nFigure 1 provides a graphical representation of how continuous intelligence supports the decision-making process. The left side of the figure demonstrates the gathering of data, both real-time and historical, which is to be later transformed into a message that is meaningful and actionable. This is where continuous intelligence plays a role. Continuous intelligence is an artificial intelligence-based system used to interpret data, find trends, and discover new insights in real-time data.\nIn essence, CI enhances the human decision-making process by bypassing the need to wait for the formation of a historical database to create new insights. The OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop seen on the right of Figure 1, illustrates a strategy for human decision making in which information is first reviewed (Observe), then analyzed (Orient), used to determine the best course of action (Decide), and finally the information is used for execution (Act). This\nFigure 1. Representation of the role of continuous intelligence in decision making.\nstrategy, originally developed for military operations, encourages quick critical thinking in response to issues that may arise or are already presenting as trends in the data. We can see how CI would fit well in this type of system as it provides an up-to-date analysis of information collected no matter the volume, complexity, or the diversity of the data. This allows businesses quick access to data so that they can act on it promptly. Speed is more necessary now than in the past as the world, in general, has become more connected to data resulting in the generation of endless amounts of information. As such, it is best to rely on a system which can continuously automate the process of data analytics so that data-driven business decisions can become more fluid.\nAdoption of Continuous Intelligence\nContinuous intelligence should be adopted by companies looking to apply real-time data analytics to systematically recognize patterns as well as provide responses to irregularities in a timely manner (Ransbotham, 2019). Gartner predicts that by 2022, more than half of major new business systems will incorporate continuous intelligence that uses real-time data to improve decisions. Those companies that can verify and analyze data in real-time and detect the valuable patterns to improve their performance will thrive compared to the companies who do not adopt these analytics. Currently, top performing organizations are building and using continuous intelligence by focusing on the right data, refining relevant information, recognizing the patterns, and acting upon them immediately (Kelly, 2019).\nAn example of continuous intelligence in current use are mobile navigation applications which continuously updates a person’s position as well as the expected time of arrival to a specified based on traffic data, travel distance, and average speed. In this setting, CI is gathering both historical and real-time data to provide users with meaningful data to act on. For example, if a traffic jam on a selected route is noted by the application, the program will prompt the individual to take a detour using an alternate route for a faster arrival time. This is just one example of how CI can be utilized, however, there is exists countless more opportunities to implement this kind of functionality into a broader set of applications to meet consumers’ expectations (Mowery).\nAnother example of the application of CI can be seen in the healthcare field. In healthcare settings, real-time data analytics can help hospitals to provide more proactive care to the patients. For example, if a patient’s most recent lab work reveals an allergy to a dye agent used during an MRI, a CI-based program can instantly inform the doctor to change the instructions for the MRI exam (Mowery). As in the case of the navigation example, here, CI provides on-the-spot information that can be used by the physician to make an informed decision. In this case, CI can directly affect a patient outcome based on the data and the analysis it has performed.\nAs has been demonstrated, CI is applicable in almost any settings. For this reason, the demand for continuous intelligence applications is soaring in the industries such as financial services, e-commerce industries, insurance companies, public sector, telecommunications, transportation, utility and retail industries (Miller, 2019). Netflix, one of the largest and most popular media streaming companies, has also CI for real-time data analytics to provide users with a personalized streaming experience based on their viewing behavior.\nContinuous Intelligence: Business Use Cases\nContinuous Intelligence use cases manifest themselves as operational intelligence uses cases in which data analysis are applied to make business decisions in real time instead of relying on historical data. Some examples of continuous intelligence business use cases are Predictive Maintenance, IoT Analytic, Supply Chain, Fleet Management, Next Best Offer and Checking Transaction for Fraud.\nDemocratize Analytics and Data Science for Continuous Intelligence\nThe consolidation of AI and automation into analytics and data science is democratizing these technologies and giving more users faster access to deeper, actionable intelligence so that they can benefit from these technologies (Pisano, 2019). These innovations in analytics and data science empower business users, data analysts, and data scientists with advanced analytics capabilities to work collaboratively, and to provide continuous intelligence across the major use cases of every business from strategic to operational (Diaz, 2018). The democratization of data makes it easier people to gain a better understanding of the data to expedite decision-making and uncover brilliant opportunities for an organization (McKinsey, 2018). In order to understand data independently and make insights-driven decisions, organizations must make data available to their employees so that they can be empowered to provide their insights on business growth.\nAccording to Gartner, the four ways to democratize analytics and data for continuous intelligence are as follows:\n- Search-driven analytics: This is about the ease of use of natural language interfaces to speed up finding and delivering insights. Every human should benefit from data-driven decision making irrespective of their proficiency with analytics tools.\n- AI-powered insights: This is about using AI, Machine learning to speed up data preparation, insight discovery, analysis, and delivery of insights.\n- Embedded data science: This is about using data science with the user simplicity of analytics dashboards for high-value use cases.\n- Streaming analytics & data science: This is about applying analytics and data science on streaming data at critical business moments.\nThere is still many areas where practical use of CI needs to be adopted. Businesses will find adopting continuous intelligence to be transformative for business operations through continuous creation of new insights which can provide a competitive advantage. Furthermore, consumers’ experience can be enhanced by making real-time data driven decisions. With real-time data analysis, organizations can promptly respond to patterns in the data and changes to market environment as well as predict future trends. With the help of CI, businesses will be able to facilitate continuous data capture and form relevant insights, providing the right information to the right people at the right time in an accurate way.\nDiaz, Alejandro, et al.

79	looking for blockchain uses in government what are the benefits of blockchain technology for document management in customs and navy supply chain	Blockchain technology provides significant benefits for document management in both customs and naval supply chains. In customs, Egypt's NAFEZA system has processed 4.5 million import transactions with zero document loss, reduced cargo release time from 16-29 days to 3-9 days, and increased revenue collection by 13%. In the Navy's case, blockchain enables secure tracking of aviation parts' lineage, replacing manual pen-and-paper tracking with a distributed ledger system that can manage critical aircraft part life events electronically, increasing efficiency and reducing operational costs.	['-- By Gamal Kotb, General Manager at MTS and Igor Jakomin, Deputy CEO at CargoX\nNOTE: This article was originally published in WCO News 99- Issue 3 / 2022 > Dossier: Disruptive Technologies, by World Customs Organization\nIn 2019, the Arab Republic of Egypt decided to move away from a slow and burdensome paper-based way of processing cross-border transactions to one based on automation and digitization. As part of this transformation, the country required economic operators and government entities to begin exchanging all required documents for import and export through digital channels. The gateway to such data exchanges is the NAFEZA single window.\nBefore the deployment of NAFEZA, the data submission process was mostly paper-based and distributed across multiple agencies. Traders had to go through numerous and occasionally redundant steps when submitting a Customs declaration, complying with border agency regulatory requirements, completing payment, and arranging for the release of their cargo.\nNAFEZA introduced a unified data submission process which significantly reduced the number of steps required to comply with such formalities. It does so by integrating a set of applications which automate and orchestrate import, export and transit cargo clearance activities. Logistic Services Centres were also established at maritime ports to oversee control operations. The various components of the single window are described in Table 1.\nA blockchain document transfer platform was added to this arsenal to enable the Customs Administration to receive and process Advance Cargo Information (ACI) filings and control the compliance of the importation process prior to the loading of the shipments from the countries of export. We described the technology in the 97th issue of the magazine, which was published at the beginning of 2022. To summarize, NAFEZA helps Egypt control the importation process from its very early stage to its end. Border agencies can better plan their activities, conduct documentation controls before the cargo reaches the port, optimize the use of their resources and minimize port congestion.\nNAFEZA was built by the Egyptian company MTS, majority-owned by the Egyptian Finance Ministry and other government entities, with CargoX providing the blockchain document transfer services. Both took into account existing norms and practices for developing single windows, as laid out in the WCO Single Window Compendium. As for the Advance Cargo Information process, it is compliant with the provisions of the SAFE Framework of Standards to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade, the International Convention on the simplification and harmonization of Customs procedures, the WCO Data Model and many other WCO instruments and items of guidance.\n“NAFEZA is used by more than 95,000 companies and entities worldwide involved in the movement of cargo by sea from and to Egypt. We continue building on this momentum by adding air cargo documentation processing to the Blockchain Document Transfer Platform.”\n-- Captain Ossama Al Sharif, MTS Chairman & CEO\nThe blockchain document transfer platform was first used for sea-freight cargo. It is currently being extended to cover air freight and might be used in the future for the exchange of information on trade finance between monetary authorities and financial institutions at the national and international levels.\nDocumentation on almost 4.5 million import transactions has been already processed through the platform in the first year of operation, with no document loss and with participants reporting major benefits in terms of cost and time savings, as well as revenue collection. It takes between 3 to 9 days to release cargo, whereas it took 16 to 29 days before (see Figure 1). Revenue collection has increased by 13 % since 2019 (see Figure 2).\nCHANGING PROCESSES AND BUSINESS MODELS\nNAFEZA introduced a new mode of working for the various government agencies involved. They therefore had to restructure their mode of operations. This included doing away with front-end services to add more resources to back-end data processing, reallocating officers to value-adding tasks, such as data analysis, reviewing KPIs, and developing real-time reporting tools to enable managers to oversee operations and intervene in the most appropriate manner.\nThe main impact for the private sector was the removal of the need to be physically present when undertaking formalities, or to make calls and visits to know the status of their declarations. They can now follow up the processing of their transactions online. The security of digital documents and data has also increased.\nDigital transformation also requires knowledge transfer and upskilling. Egyptian authorities set forth a comprehensive training plan for 2019 to 2022, during which time 2,670 Customs employees have been trained, along with 1,577 governmental employees, as well as 1,322 MTS employees and almost 17,000 trade community members.\nIMPROVED CUSTOMER SATISFACTION\n“Economic operators and governmental entities worldwide are embracing electronic trade document exchange, and the vision we had when developing our blockchain platform is becoming a reality. Working with the Government of the Arab Republic, we learned that you need governmental and business stakeholders to bring to the table the specific layers of information that they each own to develop revolutionary features which will impact an industry such as shipping in terms of efficiency, transparency, confidentiality and speed. Almost 100,000 companies around the world are using our blockchain platform in their daily trade operations. We hope that more governments will soon join.”\n-- Stefan Kukman, CEO of CargoX\nReactions to the introduction of NAFEZA have been generally positive. Local and foreign chambers of commerce played a key role as they relayed information to their members. The German-Arab Chamber of Commerce, for example, organized six webinars, attended by more than 300 participants, who were able to ask questions not only during the events, but also after.\nThe project itself, from ideation and design to implementation and deployment, has been extremely rewarding and we would like to share some of the lessons learnt from the experience.\nFirst, the project has shown that governments can drive innovation forward. The NAFEZA single window for foreign trade and its blockchain platform are unique and revolutionary.\nSecond, we now know that such solutions can be deployed in a relatively short time, despite the complexity of the work required. The prerequisites are the active involvement of all governmental bodies, and committed external and internal experts with a clear mandate and objectives, as well as passion.\n“Communication is key to a smooth and seamless introduction of new Customs clearance procedures. Together with Egyptian authorities, we were able to assist many European exporters and Egyptian importers. We will continue to serve as relay points to reach the economic players concerned and ensure that digital transformation translates into enhanced operational success for all.”\n-- German-Arab Chamber of Commerce\nThird, it is important to prove that there are benefits to change. Even when processes are known to be slow and inefficient, there will be stubborn resistance to changing them, with people clinging to the principle, “We must not lose the paper document”.\nFourth, change can be incremental. Once it has been proven that a solution has been found to manage everyday operations safely and with high reliability in a particular sector, it can be expanded to cover other business areas. The success of the blockchain platform in managing sea-freight operations has convinced the Government of Egypt to implement the electronic ACI filing approach for the air cargo transport modality.\nAnd lastly, there is no need to reinvent the wheel, even when innovating, so use the resources, guides, compendiums and available standards.\nThe strategic focus for Egypt in implementing NAFEZA is aligned with that of the WCO: to use modern technologies to support business continuity, and to ensure the resilience of global trade, no matter what type of challenges arise in the future.', 'Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is exploring the use of “blockchain” technology to help track aviation parts at maintenance facilities across the country.\nTracking parts from their origin and understanding the history of flight-critical aircraft parts is a resource consuming process that drives up the cost to operate military aircraft.\nTo increase efficiency and save money, the Navy is working to change the way it tracks the lineage of parts.\nCurrently, when parts are delivered they are tracked with pen and paper on scheduled removal component cards that get manually entered into a database.\nThrough the use of permissioned blockchain technology, the Naval Aviation Enterprise is working toward a 21st century solution to aircraft maintenance logistics.\nIndiana Technology and Manufacturing Company (ITAMCO) are the developers of a blockchain product called “SIMBA Chain”.\nSIMBA is a result of a Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) Small Business Innovation project that looked into tracking secure messages using blockchain technology.\nA Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) allows Fleet Readiness Center Southwest’s (FRCSW) Advanced Technology and Innovation Team to partner with ITAMCO and bring this technological innovation to the Navy.\nAdditionally, the agreement with ITAMCO allows the Navy to gain access to cutting edge chain code as well as innovative protocols that can quickly and securely recall data; setting the stage for the Navy to use blockchain technology to deliver large amounts of data securely. The technology will be a useful tool set among Navy, DoD and external industry partners.\nIn addition to assisting the Navy in the use of these software tools, ITAMCO will gain an understanding of various facets of the Navy, as well as a better understanding of how the supply chain operates.\nThe goal of the CRADA is to develop a conceptual architecture for what a connected and transparent supply chain could look like.\nA major hurdle to successful implementation is information assurance (IA). IA is the practice of assuring the safety of information and managing risks related to the use, processing, storage and transmission of data.\nUsing ITAMCOs accreditation for a distributed information system is a sizable departure from the centrally-controlled database design the DoD currently operates.\nThough the ability to manage large data sets is not inherent to blockchain, the Navy plans to combine file access tracking and blockchain into a technology bundle that will provide the capability to manage critical aircraft part life events and allow for custody of these events on a distributed ledger electronically. This will permit the Navy to reap the benefits of a more efficient system.\nWhen all of the nodes supporting a supply chain become connected it increases potential vulnerability, so special consideration must be given to cyber-security.\nBringing experts together early in the development phase provides a better understanding of the risks and rewards of a connected distribution system. This will allow for sound decision making in an effort to ensure any data transmitted is well protected.\nThe Navy already has a trusted network, so blockchain technology would loosely resemble public blockchains.\nPublic blockchains start with zero trust and rely on computation power in the “proof of work” consensus method.\nThe Navy model will be a permissioned chain with a consensus mechanism requiring less computing power. Conceptually developing consensus methods that maintain the integrity of the data while providing for all stake holders will be a collaborative effort.\nFRCSW is excited to be in the middle of this collaboration. As a Maintenance Repair and Overhaul facility that currently manages relationships with much of the Naval Aviation Enterprise, the command is well positioned to assist the Navy in reducing costs and increasing efficiencies for maintenance programs across the country and around the world.']	['<urn:uuid:f57fff4f-d9e3-43a1-9618-97aef0629a1d>', '<urn:uuid:92b00c31-787a-4721-b250-16ecd078e383>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	22	82	1876
80	I've heard about different ways to check heart problems - what's the main difference between heart surgery procedures like VAD implantation and less invasive tests like Coronary CTA in terms of recovery and hospital time?	VAD implantation is a major procedure requiring open-heart surgery through either an incision in the breast bone or two small incisions between the ribs, and is used for long-term heart support. In contrast, Coronary CTA is a quick, non-invasive diagnostic test that takes only about 30 minutes total, requires no hospital stay, and allows patients to resume normal daily activities immediately after the scan. After the CTA, you simply wait for the radiologist to analyze the images and send the report to your physician.	"['What treatments for heart failure are least invasive?\nHeart failure treatment. Heart failure is a chronic condition where the muscle in the heart wall weakens and is not able to pump as well as it should to supply blood and nutrients to the body. Symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, swelling in the feet, ankles, legs or abdomen, nausea, loss of appetite and weight gain will surface as the heart’s pumping function continues to deteriorate.\nFollow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://t.me/AsiaMDsg\nAlthough heart failure cannot be cured, lifelong treatment is necessary to manage the condition so that the patient can continue to live a normal, healthy life.\nThere are various treatment options available to manage the symptoms of heart failure. These include:\n- Lifestyle changes – including adopting a heart-healthy diet, an exercise and fitness routine and quitting smoking\n- Implanting devices in the chest to control heart rhythm\nIn most instances, a combination of these treatment options are necessary, depending on severity and the patient’s other health conditions.\n- Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors treat high blood pressure brought on by heart failure, by widening blood vessels.\n- Beta blockers can help to reduce the risk of irregular heartbeat and improve heart function.\nDiuretics will induce more frequent urination, to address the problem of fluid retention in the body due to heart failure. They can also help reduce fluid from the lungs and improve breathing. The doctor may also order a low fluid diet for the patient. Implanting a mechanical pump, such as a ventricular assist device (VAD), would help to strengthen heart function to pump blood to the rest of the body.\nMedical devices and surgery\nMore invasive methods of treatment could be necessary for serious cases of heart failure.\nCurrently, there are two available heart assist devices which are widely used: HeartMate III and HeartWare. Both are implantable devices which are durable and are suitable for long term use as a bridge to heart transplantation, or as destination therapy.\nWhen used as bridge-to-transplantation, VADs provide temporary support for patients while they wait for a donor heart to become available. They can also be implanted in the longer term as destination therapy for patients who are ineligible for heart transplantation.\nThese devices are implanted through an open-heart surgery, done either through an incision in the breast bone (sternotomy), or through two small incisions in spaces between the ribs.\nSometimes, treating the underlying conditions of heart failure may entail surgeries. For example, if heart failure is due to coronary heart disease, a coronary angioplasty or a coronary bypass surgery may be necessary. The former uses a tiny balloon to stretch open a narrowed or blocked artery while the latter uses a blood vessel from another part of the body to bypass a narrowed or blocked artery in the heart.\nIf the heart failure is due to a faulty heart valve, then, the doctor will recommend surgical procedures to repair or replace the faulty heart valve.\nIf the patient’s heart failure is so severe that medication or surgery does not help, then, a heart transplant to replace the diseased heart with a healthy donor heart will be necessary as a last resort.\nThis article has been verified medically by Dr Lim Chong Hee, consultant cardiothoracic surgeon at Surgi-TEN Specialists, Farrer Park Hospital (Singapore).', 'How is Coronary CTA different from other heart tests?\nOne of the common heart tests is the coronary angiogram. This test is invasive. In an invasive coronary angigram, a catheter is usually inserted into a blood vessel in the upper thigh, then maneuvered up to the coronary arteries. Contrast medium is then injected via the catheter and images an captured using X-rays.

81	nature connection cultural importance modern cities	The connection with nature has both cultural and modern urban importance. From a cultural perspective, ancient traditions like Daoism and Native American ways emphasize deep connection with nature as a source of wisdom and authenticity. In modern cities like Bangalore, this connection manifests through sacred spaces like temples, which preserve biodiversity with native trees and provide essential ecosystem services. While cities face rapid urbanization challenges, traditional approaches to nature conservation, such as religious sites and cultural practices, can be integrated with modern urban development to maintain ecological balance and human wellbeing.	"['A7: 我們永遠不會知道我們會對世界有什麼樣的影響力。1960年代時，怎麼都不會想到我會參與一個全球性的運動。在美國規劃「環境的未來研討會(Future of The Environment Congress)」時，我參與了研討會的命名過程。當時我們選擇「環境」，的確希望能夠讓這想法更蔓延拓展，但是卻沒想到環保的議題會成為全球性的運動。這也讓所有推動善念的人有了希望。我們無法預知未來，但是卻可以推動我們認為會有幫助的事項。這是我對於文化變革上的努力。有時候，當別人問我在做什麼的時候，我的回答是「我是推動文化變革的媒介者」，而不是推動領導人變革的人。這是一種文化的變革。\nA9: 我希望台灣能成為一個培養出與大自然共有深度諧和感情的模範。我覺得台灣的文化中已經有許多這方面的元素，只需要更深度探索。 感應力的力量是極度可觀的。存在感的確很好，但是若無法將放鬆的技巧加以熟練，就無法感受到真正的存在。因此，我從事的志業的核心，就是在存在的當下，注入真正的感應力。\nInterview with the “Way of Nature’s"" John Milton\n(This interview is recorded and reported by Keli Yen-Project Manager of CPYF)\nThe CP Yen Foundation had the privilege of hosting naturalist John Milton for two weeks this September. In addition to our public workshops for facilitators, coaches and leaders we also did trainings for volunteers and staff of Yang Ming Shan National Park and the Hualien Forestry Bureau. During his stay, Jorie Wu and George Yen had the pleasure of doing an interview of John over a relaxing breakfast at home.\nJohn Milton’s been traveling the world planting cultural seeds to reconnect society’s relationship with nature. His method is called the Way of Nature and introduces a path, methods and principles supporting people’s gradual reintroduction to our fundamental source of being. This month’s dialogue newsletter is an interview with John Milton about the way of nature’s key message:\nQ1: How does outer nature connect to one’s inner nature?\nA1: The English word nature refers to the world both external and internal to ourselves – the environment and our deeper truth. Enlightenment also refers to awareness about the truth of our outer and inner environment, the nature of our mind, things as they are, and the truth of being.\nQ2: What lineage does your knowledge come from?\nA2: Daoism and the Native American way are my top knowledge lineages. Tibetan shamanic Bon, the ancient tradition of Dzogchen as well as the forest dwellers tradition that goes back many thousands of years in India are integrated into the Way of Nature as well. From the West I draw from Celtic traditions who are deeply connected to nature. The Way of Nature’s 12 Principles is a distillation of these different cultures and offers a practice for learning how to go deep in nature.\nQ3: How are the 12 Principles helpful to leaders?\nA3: If you want to be a good leader you need to be connected with the source of pure creativity and integrity within yourself. The closer you come to an authentically deep place of your being, the better you are able to deal with both inner and outer disturbances. “Theory U” author Otto Scharmer calls this the ‘base of the U’ which is a recapitulation of an ancient view that to resolve issues and problems as they arise you’ve got to tap into the deep part of yourself and honor it as the source of creativity.\nQ4: What is source? And how to know if one’s really in touch with source?\nA5: I can’t do any better than the Dao De Jing （道德經）: “the source that can be named is not the true source.” So anyone who talks about this must begin with humility about the subject. Talking about source is like a finger pointing at the moon; at some point you must take the finger away, and directly experience the moon. So with that preface, the first thing to say about source is that it must be experienced. Paradoxically, it’s within us all. Including the family dog. Source provides the primary level for all connectedness. All forms arise from source, are continuously changing and connected in a vast ecology of form. This is the basic foundation of the “green” environmental aspect of us all. This isn’t theoretical, it’s a fundamentally practical. Both we and the mosquito that bit you arise from the same authentic reality, modern physics support this as well. My experience of being hit by lightening and shot into the light and pulled back again, is my experience of source, and I speak from that experience when I teach. The words that can be applied to the experience of source are: clarity like a mirror with tremendous space to reflect all things including sound and the rays of light that permeates space.\nQ6: In Taiwan you’ve met with different groups of participants from business to the forest service; what has been your impression so far?\nA6: I am impressed by the group’s high levels of intellect, refined awareness, their very good questions, their connection to nature and the insights gained from that, and their wonderful ability to share; I’ve been amazed by the depth of sharing of people’s experiences. I’ve been very favorably impressed by Taiwanese culture, which has ancient roots, and I think their indigenous connections lend strength to the Taiwanese culture.\nIndigenous roots are important is because they have learned how to live in harmony with nature from an ecological perspective. Indigenous peoples had to learn how to relate to the local environment in a sustainable way and this wisdom continues to have value for teaching modern humans how to live sustainably. Today our risk of losing that cultural wisdom is just as great as biodiversity loss. Biomimicry is one way we can learn from biology to create technologies and new ways of behavior; for example, Velcro is a product inspired by natural Gecko feet. Ecomimicry is an equivalent term relating to an organization’s ability to learn from an entire ecosystem in how we design our own living systems.\nQ7: What difference do you aspire to make in the world?\nA7: We never really know what impact we’re going to have on the world. In the 1960s I had no idea that I was part of a movement that would become global. At the “Future of The Environments Congress” in the US I was involved in the selection of the word “environment”; we hoped it would catch on but didn’t know it would become a global movement. So that gives some hope to us who are working towards greater good; there’s no way we can really predict, yet we can set in motion what we think would be helpful. That’s my attempt at cultural transformation. Sometimes when people ask what I do I respond “I’m a culture change agent” more than leadership change, its cultural change.\nI want to leave behind a well grounded movement to go out in to nature alone and use these simple tools, principles, and sensing processes to profoundly transform human’s relationship with the earth; so that the earth becomes their family, and their lives are engaged differently thanks to this earth-based perspective. That would have a reverberating effect on ethics, public policy, and the choices we make in our lives.\nQ8: What is your suggestion to our participants on what next steps to take?\nA8: www.wayofnature.com and http://www.sacredpassage.com offers resources for going into one’s nature. Use them. Take a bit of time out each day or week to go out with your family into the park and practice. Or, have a gathering at someone’s home, watch a movie that emphasizes on a principle, discuss it, then perhaps go out in nature together on a regular basis.\nQ9: What blessing would you like to send to Taiwan?\nA9: I hope that Taiwan becomes an exemplar of cultivating a deep sense of harmony with nature. I think there are already elements in Taiwanese culture that are like that, it’s just a matter of going deeper. The power of the receptive is immense. Presence is really great, but you can’t have true presence without having mastered relaxation. So the heart of what I do is to bring true receptivity into the essence of Presence.', 'Once considered a predominantly rural country, India is rapidly urbanizing. Although less than 1/3rdof India’s population now lives in cities, in the next two decades we are expected to cross the threshold where more than half of the country’s people will live in cities. How will this rapid progress towards urban ways of life shape ecology, natural resources and biodiversity in India? Unfortunately, we have very little information to draw on. The attention of Indian ecologists and conservation biologists has largely focused on understanding “natural” ecosystems such as forests in protected areas. Urban researchers rarely study ecology, while ecologists rarely consider cities worth of attention. Thus urban biodiversity remains a double blind spot, even as crises of urban ecology gain force across the country.\nBangalore constitutes a characteristic example of a growing Indian city, famous internationally (even spawning new words such as “Bangalored”) as well as within India for its software industry. Yet many readers may not be aware that Bangalore has a much longer history of settlement from millenia in the past. The city itself has been an important Indian urban commercial center from the 16thcentury onwards. Well known for its green spaces and lakes, Bangalore was once called “India’s Garden City”. In recent years it has witnessed accelerated and highly unequal growth, transforming a landscape with forests, orchards, lakes, wetlands, pastures and fertile agriculture into a sea of concrete apartments and commercial complexes.\nBangalore is known to host to an impressive list of other plant and animal species. A checklist of fauna compiled by S. Karthikeyan in 1999 lists as many as 340 species of birds, 160 species of butterflies, 40 species of mammals, 38 species of reptiles, 16 species of amphibians, and 41 species of fish in the city, with reports of a new ant species identified in Bengaluru as recently as in 2006 – highlighting the unexplored nature of these city environments.\nAs with many Indian cities such as Pune and Delhi, Bangalore is fortunate in having a number of academic and religious institutions, government and military areas, in addition to areas formally established by city municipalities for urban greening such as parks. These different types of land use support biodiversity in different ways. Human choice, behaviour and policies directly impact plant diversity in particular. For instance, the landscape of Bangalore was quite dry and scrubby prior to the mid-19thcentury, when settlers began to find that urbanization lead to increased temperature. Extensive tree plantation was then conducted across the city to provide shade, greenery and visual relief. The species selected were a careful mix of local and exotic, with a focus of ensuring that at any point in time, some species of trees would be flowering, providing a spectacular visual pageant across the city.\nApart from streets, great attention was paid to improving the condition of Bangalore’s two historical botanical gardens – Lal Bagh, created in the 18thcentury by the former rulers of this region, Hyder Ali and Tippu Sultan, and Cubbon Park, established in the 19thcentury by British administrators. An 1891 British book by John Cameron, “Catalogue of Plants in the Botanical Garden, Bangalore (Second Edition)” describes 3,222 species planted in Lal Bagh alone. In addition to these and a few other mid-sized parks established several decades ago, the city also hosts a number of small neighbourhood parks that are landscaped with manicured hedges and greater lawn area, with fewer trees. These parks are small but play an important role in supporting biodiversity, especially for mobile taxa such as birds and butterflies. Most flora in parks is exotic – only one out of every five trees in parks is a native species.\nHome gardens form another variety of pocket green space that is critical for biodiversity support in Bangalore. We studied 328 domestic gardens and apartments in Bangalore, and documented over 1668 trees belonging to 91 species, in addition to 192 species of shrubs and herbs. Of these, only the coconut is widespread, encountered in more than 30% of locations. Bangalore’s domestic garden owners seem to value the unusual, with 90% of the tree species and 80% found in less than 5% of the gardens. Compared to many other studies in domestic gardens in western countries which report a focus on ornamental plants, we found that many species planted for their food, medicinal or religious properties, including trees such as jackfruit, mango and drumstick, and plants such as papaya, banana, coriander and sacred basil. Domestic gardeners are creative, finding ways to host plants even in congested homes. In contrast to parks, which are heavily landscaped and sprayed with pesticides and insecticides, most home gardeners avoided using chemical sprays because of health concerns. Thus home gardens are more sustainable, and more bird and insect-friendly. Many home owners also make special efforts to support biodiversity, by placing rice out to feed birds, providing water baths, and leaving sugar out for ants. Slums constitute rich pockets of biodiversity as well, with a very high proportion of native plants, and use of plants with medicinal properties for home health remedies.\nUnfortunately, in many parts of Bangalore, gardens, wetlands and other green spaces are being converted to corporate campuses and upscale gated residential communities, dominated by manicured landscapes, with exotic turf grasses, non-flowering variegated shrubs and herbs, and hybridized small sized flowering trees and exotic palms that do not provide fruits, flowers, insect habitat and nesting areas for butterflies, birds, and insects. The extensive use of pesticides in these landscapes also impacts bird feeding, nesting and breeding.\nThe pressures of urbanization on Indian cities are not unique to Bangalore, nor are they new. Yet the impacts are certainly spreading to other parts of India where villages are growing into small towns, towns into cities, and cities into megapolises. The role and influence of ideas of the sacred are however unique to Indian cities, and may provide a path forward for some conservation. For instance, historic cemeteries serve as sites for heritage tree protection in many Indian cities, as well as sacred traditions of conservation of aspects of nature such as anthills. Mosques constitute sacred locations associated with feeding of species such as pigeons and goats. Many cities and towns also contain centuries old temples with embedded with characteristic architectural features such as ponds, and protection of tree species such as the Ficus. Our recent study of sacred spaces across Bangalore recorded 5504 trees from 93 species in 62 temples, churches, and Hindu, Christian and Muslim cemeteries in central areas of Bengaluru. One in two tree species were of native origin, as compared to the dominance of exotic trees in parks. The density of trees in sacred sites was also much higher than that in parks, home gardens and slums. The rich diversity of cultural and spiritual traditions of worship in India thus holds promise for the future of biodiversity in Indian cities. Yet new paths of conservation need to be forged that can integrate these traditional approaches with modernization, ensuring their continued importance in urban management practices.\nBiodiversity is essential in cities. We need trees and plants to clean our polluted air and water, help in ground water percolation, ensure continued monsoons, cool the overheated concrete city, provide medicine and fuel, fruits, flowers and grazing material. Urban biodiversity is also essential for good physical and mental health, providing safe spaces for exercise and recreation, and relaxation and relief in stressed city environments. Sadly, despite the multiple benefits they provide, urban ecosystems are the most endangered of land use categories in a city – considered as “waste” spaces that can be taken over to build apartments and malls, roads and airports. The story of Bangalore is the story of biodiversity beleaguered, under threat, but still holding on in brave pockets of resistance – in slums, sacred spaces, home gardens and parks. We need to understand the importance of biodiversity and work together to protect our urban ecological heritage. Only then can India’s new urban era prove to be an era of ecological and human wellbeing.\nNote: This article is a modified version of H. Nagendra (6th February 2013).

82	sacred architecture agni temple design fire element role relationship between physical structure spiritual transformation explain hindu principles	In Hindu principles, sacred architecture and agni (fire) work together to enable spiritual transformation through specific relationships between physical structures and divine energy. Temple architecture shapes and transforms energy through carefully designed elements like domes and pyramids that create rhythmic responses. The Deep Mala fire pillar serves as a critical bridge between individual consciousness and universal space. This architectural approach aligns with agni's role as a fundamental force of transformation - agni represents accelerated energy that generates heat and enables evolution. The temple's physical design elements work in harmony with sacred fire to create an environment that facilitates the transformation of human consciousness into higher spiritual states through purification and transcendence.	"['From Hindupedia, the Hindu Encyclopedia\nTemples are places of focus for all aspects of life - religious, cultural, educational and social. A temple allows visitors to transcend the world of man and to connect with God.\nA temple is a place where you can approach God and realize divine knowledge. Temples are constructed to help aspirants in their journey to enlightenment and liberation. The principles of design and construction and the forms of architecture and decoration were all designed with this principle in mind. All of these are described in detail in the Agama and the Vastu shastra texts. These texts describe how architecture and decorations should be created to help focus human energy on the Divine. Vastu Shastra has a section explicitly devoted to the design of temples.\nTemple are designed to dissolve the boundaries between man and the divine. A temple is not considered to simply be the abode of God, but also is God. God and therefore by implication the whole universe is identified with the temple\'s design and actual fabric. The ground plan, site location (and its relation to shade and water), its vertical elevation relating to mountains, etc are all important aspects to a temple.\nThe Puranas state that ""The gods always play where groves are near rivers, mountains and springs"". Sacred sites are therefore usually associated with water, shade and lakes are often considered to be sacred and certain lakes have healing and purifying powers. Certain rivers, such as the Ganga, have descended from the heavens and their sacred waters are needed in the temple tank.\nCaves are places of great sanctity. Most of the earliest surviving shrines are rock cut caves. In later temples the garbagriha was designed to resemble a cave and as such was small and dark and the surfaces of the walls were unadorned and massive. The garbagriha is a place that encourages meditation which is possible only in solitude. Approaching the shrine is a movement from open spaces to a confined small space; from light to darkness, from a profusion of visual form and decoration to the visual simplicity of the cave. From this sanctuary the implied movement is vertical, to the symbolic mountain peak directly above the image of the god. This movement upwards is linked to the idea of enlightenment which is identified with the crowning finial of the temple - the amalaka or sikara.\nThe concept of spirituality in the system of sacred architecture in India is something that goes beyond the mere static relations between inert objects and space as found in other architectural traditions. The relationship of objects with one another and space in India\'s sacred architecture extends to include higher entities said to be in charge of various aspects of universal affairs, all of whom carry out their work in accordance with the will of God.\nMost ancient stone temples were the result of royal patronage and built to benefit of the whole community, they were expressions of the devotion and piety of the ruler and his people.\nThe temples were maintained through donations from royal patrons and private individuals. They were given money, gold, silver, livestock and income from grants of land which sometimes included whole villages.\nHow temples shape and transform energy\nThe purpose of all rituals is directed towards reshaping of human psyche, transformation of individual perception into universal perception, and radical changes in personal thoughts, desires, and ambitions. The space or sky is reshaped in temple architecture through domes, pyramids, various shapes and forms to provide maximum rhythmic response to achieve the desired results.\nAll religious rituals have a definite aim - transformation of the lower energy formats in the human being into the energy form of the outer spaces, or the sky, or the universal being that is immensity. A suitable medium is provided by the sky as shaped by the domes and pyramids. A deity in the temple is a medium to absorb all the individual desires suitably transformed by rituals. The Deep Mala (fire pillar) in the line of the deity\'s vision in the outer space of the temple serves as the bridge linking the inner vessel of collective desires represented by the deity with outer space or sky that is universal immensity. This fire pillar has a characteristic shape, which points towards the sky. A divine fire, which is the purifying factor in the temples, is lit using ghee made from cow\'s milk. Through this fire circulates a rhythmic ascending energy form. Deity\'s vision is normally aligned to the North or the East directions, which are the sources of Jaivik Urja or positive energies.\nTemple architecture represents the concept of evolution and radical changes. The complex energy forms and finer elements are intertwined with deities, trees, plants, colors, shapes and forms in the temple architecture. Different deities in the temple represent body, mind, intellect and the sub-components. These deities are then linked to the cosmos by associating them with specific directions. This philosophy establishes a chain of relationships between micro level elements and the macro level existence. The mandalas available in temples are essentially charts of existence, transformations, and energetic.\nTemple Architecture and Pranayam\nPavan or wind is the bridge for the mind to ascend to the sky. The holistic concept of evolution is defined in terms of the medium - the wind. Wind represents both, the Sound and the sky. Therefore, primordial sounds are the keys to reinforcing the bond between the mind and the sky. Controlling the wind element at individual level is called pranayam. We can say that the temple architecture provides a natural stage of pranayam, not with any definite individual efforts, but through various forms, shapes, rituals, and sounds. These parameters establish a unique path for correlating the wind and the sky. Domes and pyramids in the temple transform the sound into the mandalas. The echo of this rhythmic primordial sound takes the wind to the sky. The Gurutatva is described as \'Akhand Mandalakaram\'. This means that the rhythmic mandalas created by the echo of primordial sounds activate the gurutatva in the human mind.\nIn other words, temple architecture creates a space for holistic atmosphere of natural Pranayam suitable for any individual. Echo of primordial sounds enters the limitless finer circles beyond the audible range and helps the mind to transcend maya to reach the Absolute.\nTemple Design Manuals\nThe Agamas and the Vastu Shastra texts are the scriptural authorities on temple architecture. They give precise details and formulas prescribing how to design, carve and assemble a temple. The resulting structure and its relationship with its surroundings create a subtle, sublime atmosphere in which ceremonies performed by priests easily lift the veil between this world and the world of the Gods and Devas so their blessings can pour forth to gathered devotees.\nIn fact, temple architecture is a specialized subject in Vaastu Shastra. Right from selection of site, to defining the dimensions of the structure, to placement of water source or pond and deep mala, to determining the exact form and proportions of the idol is described in great detail.\nThe temple should be built at a suitable place, like a Tirtha. The ideal location is a a beautiful place where rivers flow, on the banks of a lake or by the seashore; on hill tops, mountain slopes, or in a hidden valley. The site of the temple may be selected in a forest, a grove, or in a beautiful garden. Temples should also be built in villages, towns and cities or on an island, surrounded by water.\nThe temple itself should always face east since that is the most auspicious direction. From the east appears the rising sun, the destroyer of darkness and the giver of life.\nSignificance of Prakrima\nWhen in a temple, it is customary to circumambulate the deity.\nWhen a temple is established and life is infused into the deity through a proper pran pratistha ceremony, divinity enters the deity. This divinity is in the form of magnetic waves starting from the central point of the base of the deity and spreads around in a circle. The vibrations are the strongest near the deity and gradually weaken as the circle becomes larger. The positive vibrations influence a person walking around the deity.\nThe magnetic field moves in a clockwise direction, therefore, it is essential that one walks around the deity clockwise. By moving along the magnetic field of the deity one can benefit from the positive vibrations one receives. These vibrations are a blessing that strengthen the worshipper and protect him/her from all kinds of problems and calamities. After completing prayers and offerings, it is therefore customary to walk around the deity.\nThe longer one walks around the deity, the greater the benefit from the vibrations. It is customary to walk 5 to 11 times around a deity.\nReligious texts direct that when going around the deity of Shankar one should not cross the line where the offering of milk and water flows. For this reason, one takes only half a round around Shankar. One returns and then does the other half because the vibrations around Lord Shankar move both clockwise and anti-clockwise.\nWhen one walks anti-clockwise, the divine vibrations that move clockwise counter the individual\'s personal vibrations, gradually destroying them. Therefore, the anti-clockwise movement is prohibited. The harmful effects vary according to the Deity being circumambulated.\nThere are four kinds of rituals conducted in a temple: nitya (daily), naimittika (occasional), kamya (optional) and prayaschitta (expiation).\nMore about Temples\nTemples throughout India\nTemples of Andra Pradesh\nTemples of Karnataka\nTemples of West bengal\n- Kalighat Temple\n- Dakshineshwar Temple\nTemples of Gujarat\n- Somnath Temple\n- Dwarkadhish Temple\n- Dakor Temple\nTemples of Jammu & Kashmir\n- Vaishno devi Temple\nTemples of Tamil Nadu\n- Thiru Aayarpaadi Sri Kari Krishna Perumal\n- Pallikondeswara Swamy Surutapalli Devasthanam\n- Vasishteswaraswamy Temple\n- Sri Naganathaswamy Temple Thirunageshwaram\n- Sri Balasubramanya Swamy Temple Ayikudi\n- Sri Dharbarenyeswarar Temple Thirunallaru\n- Sri Swedaranyeswarar Temple Thiruvengadu\n- Sri Kalyanavaradharaja Perumal Temple Paruthiyur\n- Karungaali Sri Chinthaamaneesarar\n- Thiruverkaadu Sri Karumaari Amman\n- Thiruverkaadu Sri Vedhapureeswarar\n- Kettavarampalayam Sri Ramar\n- Madhuraanthakam Eri Kaatha Sri Raamar\n- Vallakkottai Sri Subramanyar\n- Thiruninravur Sri Hridhayaaleeswarar\n- Thiruninravur Sri Bhakthavatsala Perumal\n- Thirumazhisai Sri Othaandeswarar\n- Thirusoolam Sri Thirusoolanaadhar\n- Singaperumal Koil Sri Ugra Narasimhar\n- Chettippunyam Sri Varadharaja Perumal\n- Thirukkachur Sri Kachabeswarar\n- Thirukkachur Sri Oushadheeswarar\n- Hanumanthapuram Sri Agora Veerabadhrar\n- Chenganmaal Sri Chenganmaaleeswarar\n- Thiru Idaichuram Sri Gnanapureeswarar\n- Sembakkam Sri Jambugeswarar\n- Cherappanancheri Sri Veemeeswarar\n- Thirumalai Vaiyaavoor Sri Prasanna Venkatesa Perumaal\n- Ezhuchur Sri Nallinakkeeswarar\n- Ariyathurai Sri Varamoortheeswarar\n- Thiruvidandhai Sri Nithya Kalyaana Perumaal\n- Kolappaakkam Sri Agatheeswarar\n- Somangalam Sri Somanaadheeswarar\n- Gerugambaakkam Sri Neelakandeswarar\n- Porur Sri Ramanaadheswarar\n- Kunrathur Sri Naageswarar\n- Maangaadu Sri Velleeswarar\n- Poondhamalli Sri Vaidheeswarar\n- Kovur Sri Sundhareswarar\n- Maangaadu Sri Vaikunda Perumaal\n- Nandhambakkam Sri Kothandaramar\n- Pozhichalur Sri Agatheeswarar\n- Aathur Sri Muktheeswarar\n- Koyambedu Sri Kurungaaleeswarar\n- Semmancheri Sri Srinivasa Perumaal\n- Vyasarpadi Sri Raveeswarar\n- Pon Vilaindha Kalathur Sri Munkudumeeswarar\n- Ponpadhar Koodam Sri Chathurbuja Kothandaraamar\n- Manimangalam Sri Dharmeswarar\n- Manimangalam Sri Kailaasanaadhar\n- Vallam Sri Vedhaantheeswarar and Sri Giri Varadharaaja Perumaal\n- Kaaladi Sri Aadhi Sankarar', 'Tapas and Agni: Transformative heat\nby Jim Kulackoski\nAccording to the ancient Vedic sciences of India, the entire universe is in a constant state of flux or action. This perpetual state of transformation is what makes existence possible, for when something ceases to evolve, it ultimately ceases to be – in a more familiar contemporary ideology: “If you are not growing, you are dying.” The Vedic ideas of agni and tapas are interrelated in this cosmic evolution.\nIn the Vedic interpretation, tapas in an intense drive or “burning desire” towards accomplishing something. It is an intense persistence or devotion to an idea that allows one to carry it out to completion. As one encounters a number of obstacles on the path to completing any task, they must ultimately transcend those obstacles in order to complete that task, leaving them a different person. In Tantric philosophy, tapas has another meaning: the internal heat generated during certain yogic practices. This heat is the result of the conversion of the body’s fundamental essence (ojas) into a refined form of prana, bio-energy used in the development of soma, a higher state of consciousness brought about by physiological integration. In both definitions, tapas is the catalyst for transformation.\nThe principle of transformation that occurs due to the “friction” created from the persistence of tapas is called agni. Because transformation is a necessary component in existence, agni is one of the most important devatas, or laws of nature.\nAgni is an accelerated state of energy, the result of which is heat, and thus, agni and tapas are both associated with the idea of heat.\nSacred Fire: Purifying the spirit\nby Paul Tootalian\nFire. by scientific definition, fire is a process of rapid oxidation that releases heat, light and energy. But with a makeup far more mysterious, fire is at the same time a wild force of nature, an element untamed. Why do so many religions and spiritual paths depict fire as a divine spirit enveloping us? Part spirit, part dancing deity, alive and breathing, fire symbolizes the sun, resurrection and transformation in action.\nInner fires invoke the archetypal reality of purification of the human spirit, an image that opens us up to deeper dimensions. Outer fires reflect this passion as they light the spiritual path, from the wildness fire pits of Native American ceremonies and flaming Shinto altars, to Christian shrines aglow in candlelight. In Plato’s ancient Allegory of the Cave, prisoners are chained in a cave, riveted by the flickering shadows of objects projected on the cave wall in the light of a fire. Misguided, the prisoners believe the shadows to be real, however, the fire itself represents reality’s true form.\nThis is the power of Hinduism’s agni, primordial fire, God aflame. “As a lamp in a windless place does not waver,” is how the Bhagavad Gita describes the focused, purified mind. India’s sacred text goes on to praise fire in the light of glorifying spiritual masters, who, “with the torchlight of knowledge,” opened eyes blinded by the darkness of ignorance. This is the sacredness of fire.\nTapas and the Fire Element\nby Monica Yearwood\nAyurveda, the ancient system of natural healing, regards fire as a central life-giving source. Fire and its variants, light and heat, are used to describe internal processes within the body such as digestion and metabolism as well as mental acuity and emotional tendencies. We also generate fire and heat through spiritual discipline that benefits our intuition and connects us with the divine.\nFire sustains the entire planet, as the manifestation of the sun. Light, a byproduct of fire, illuminates our path and enables us to see. The sun, a primary source of fire for the entire universe and its inhabitants, dictates the daily practices that make up ayurvedic lifestyle, called dinacharya. Ayurveda teaches that practices such as waking up with the sunrise and eating our largest meal at midday, when the sun is at its strongest, offer numerous health benefits.\nAyurveda teaches that a sacred window opens just at sunrise and sunset each day, a time that supports deeper introspective practices such as meditation and yoga.\nMeditation and yoga burn away karma and enhance the fire of intellect. Surya namaskar, often translated as “sun salutations,” is a specific set of yoga postures dedicated to the sun. This series strengthens the body, but also burns away toxins in the body and purifies the mind with its heat. Many of the physical practices in yoga are used to burn away impurities in the mind, blockages in the energetic channels and obstructions in the physical body.\nAyurveda sees the human body as a small microcosm of the universal body, thus the sun and its byproducts, including light and heat, can be found within our physiology. Ayurveda recognizes agni (fire) in the physical body as a primary facilitator of health.\nAyurvedic practitioners assess the function of agni in their clients through the assessment of the doshas. Vata types, who tend toward variability, need to maintain constant agni. These types are advised to adopt regularity in their eating and sleeping times. Pitta types, who tend toward excess agni, need to implement a cooling diet and herbs to protect themselves from a variety of heat-related disorders. Kapha types, who tend toward low agni, need to constantly stoke their internal fire with pungeant spices and regular fasting.\nEach tissue in the body has a corresponding agni that regulates its proper metabolism. The jatharagni is the central, digestive fire in the body. Ayurveda describes four types of agni that regulate our digestion:\n- visham (variable) agni, most common in vata types;\n- tikshna (high) agni, most common in pitta types;\n- manda (slow) agni, most common in kapha types;\n- and sama (balanced) agni.\nAppetite can assess the function of our digestive agni. If we are constantly hungry and seldom satisfied, our agni is tikshna. If we have lost interest in food, our agni is manda. If we continually lose and gain our appetite, our agni is potentially visham.\nAyurvedic practitioners teach breathing practices to help regulate prana (the life force), which in turn regulates the fires in the physical body. Some breathing practices can increase agni, burn away blockages and stimulate digestion. Other practices can reduce agni if it is too high, or regulate agni if it is inconsistent. If one’s breathing is complete, deep and unobstructed, it is a good sign that agni is functioning properly.\nTejas is the fire of the intellect, and the essence of pitta dosha. It enables correct perception, clarity and illumination, and is cultivated by spiritual study an concentration exercises. The yogic practice of trataka, for example, involves staring at a candle flame. By resisting the urge to blink, the body eventually produces special tears that wash the eyes, purify the perceptual senses and develop tejas.\nWe can assess the propensity of our tejas by observing the clarity with which we approach our activities. Tejas bestows confidence, faith and trust in our choices. It illuminates our path and allows us to correctly perceive impending obstacles. If the mind is marred with confusion, self-doubt and apprehension, most likely tejas has been dimmed.\nTapas is the heat produced from spiritual efforts. It is generated by our willpower, self-challenge and endurance. In a Vedic mythic story about the goddess Parvati and the god Shiva, Parvati falls in love with Shiva but is initially rejected by him. In her determination, she dedicates herself to spiritual austerities. She performs all the traditional mortifications, such as sitting in the flour fires in the middle of summer and standing on one leg for years. Parvati eventually exceeds all of the great sages in her efforts and generates so much tapas that the gods begin to get uncomfortable by her power. The gods beg Shiva to grant Parvati’s wish to be with him to get her to stop. The teaching of the story is that by generating tapas we are granted spiritual boons.\nIn spite of all of these positive connotations of fire, if uncontrolled, it can destroy. Excess fire, mostly related to pitta dosha, can burn the body and cause disease. Symptoms of heat such as skin inflammations, acne, liver toxicity and loose bowel movements are symptoms of excess pitta.\nUnlike tejas, which creates illumination and clear perception, pitta dosha intensifies criticism, anger and desire to control. In general, pitta types are most susceptible toward these imbalances, which can be remedies by Ayurvedic lifestyle programs. Damaging inner fires can be reduced through a cooling and drying diet. Bitter leafy greens such as Swiss chard and kale reduce pitta’s oily and hot qualities. Coriander seed, chamomile and aloe can be taken internally if pitta is provoking digestive heat. Turmeric can assist with calming the irritability and control of a pitta-type liver.\nThe heat, humidity and longer periods of light in summer provoke pitta dosha and expose all types to excess pitta. The earth provides the antidote by offering an array of cooling fruits and vegetables. A higher carbohydrate diet from fruits provides the energy required for heightened physical activity. Swimming, sitting in the shade and avoiding outdoor exercise in the strong, midday sun can help everyone stay in balance.\nTepid Tapas: Finding the heat without getting burned\nby Trayci Handelman\nFor years I over-chaturanga’d. “Over,” as in over the limit in how many a yogi should do in a class, a day, a month; over the limit that a mortal shoulder could take. “Over,” as in overused until the rips that I had created in my shoulder had to be sewn and screwed into my rotator cuff with metal anchors. Now I am conservative with the chaturanga and realize I have tendencies to over-chaturanga in other ways.\nTapas (Sanskrit for “heat”) is the third niyama, or spiritual observance, in the Yoga Sutras. It refers to the “burning off” of negative energies in order to follow a true path of spiritual devotion. Within our society the mere mention of fire, burn or heat tends to lead to thoughts of the extreme and excess – the idea that more must be better. For yogis, this can mean hotter classes, more workshops, more studios, harder arm balances, crazier sequences. Why do we push ourselves to excess, instead of finding a place of comfort before the burnout?\n“Too much of everything is just enough” comes to mind, a lyric from a Grateful Dead song. We have been programmed to want more, bigger, stronger, hotter. Yet any niyama should be considered within the context of all five of these concepts. The interesting part about the niyamas is that they intertwine, lean on each other, even reference each other, in very subtle ways. Santosha, another niyama, means contentment, to be satisfied and grateful that what you have is enough. Svadhyaya speaks of self-study, specifically pertaining to gaining more knowledge to deepen the understanding of the self.\nIn the Yoga Sutras, the true meaning of discipline and purification is for the greater purpose of contentment and spiritual growth/devotion. Can we use these niyamas without burning out or overdosing on the notions? This answer, like most answers in all areas of yoga – spiritual, physical, emotional – is found within ourselves.\nFind the tapas – the thing that lights you up from the inside. Tap into it. Follow it, trust it, commit to it. If it starts to burn you, or worse – starts to fade you or weaken you – pause. Breathe and reflect. Is it too much, too soon, too intense? Only you will know. Follow that inner fire, the internal tapas, and more than likely you will never get burned. This is actually referred to as Mati, one of the 10 original niyamas, developing a cognitive, spiritual will. Yoga is about self-acceptance, not self-improvement. If we can keep focusing in, rather than seeking out, the answers should never be farther than the corners of our mat.\nTapas Tunes: Songs that sing of summer\n- Orange Sky, Alexi Murdoch\n- Southern Sun, Boy & Bear\n- Summer Breeze, Seals & Crofts\n- Hard Sun, Eddie Vedder\n- Sunshine (Go Away Today), Jonathan Edwards\n- Rain in the Summertime, The Alarm\n- Fired Up!, Funky Green Dogs\n- Blinded by the Light, Manfred Mann’s Earth Band\n- Sun Light, MC Yogi\n- Burn it in the Fire, Wade Morissette\n- The Sound of Sunshine, Michael Franti & Spearhead\n- The Boys of Summer, Don Henley\n- She’s a Rainbow, The Rolling Stones\n- Desert Rose, Sting\n- Follow the Sun, Xavier Rudd\n- Hearts on Fire, Passenger\n- Long Time Sun, Girish\n- Soak Up The Sun, Sheryl Crow\n- Over the Rainbow, Israel Kamakawiwo’ole']"	['<urn:uuid:86e43fe2-f969-42a4-9f5b-1261888b7da2>', '<urn:uuid:37b593bb-721c-4f94-acc4-02563ed970ff>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	17	111	3981

84	I've heard about mixed rice dishes and I'm wondering - how do bibimbap and rijsttafel compare in terms of their basic serving concept and the way people eat them?	While both are rice-based dishes with multiple components, they differ in their serving concept. Rijsttafel is served with rice as a base and 17-30 different small dishes arriving all at once, with diners taking small portions to blend flavors and textures throughout the meal. The dishes include various meats, vegetables, fruits, relishes, and condiments, with diners mixing components as they eat. Bibimbap, on the other hand, involves mixing various relishes with already cooked rice in a single bowl - as indicated by its original name 'goldongban' where 'goldong' means to mix together various objects. The concept is simpler, with all ingredients combined in one bowl rather than spread across multiple small dishes like in rijsttafel.	"['Rice Table -\' rijsttafel\'\na picture of rijsttafel by colleentravel5\nAmsterdam (A Special Feast)\nThe Indonesian feast rijsttafel is Holland\'s favorite meal and has been ever since the Dutch United East India Company captains introduced it to the wealthy burghers of Amsterdam in the 17th century. The rijsttafel (literally ""rice table"") originated with Dutch plantation overseers in Indonesia, who liked to sample selectively from Indonesian cuisine. It became a kind of tradition, one upheld by Indonesian immigrants to Holland who opened restaurants and, knowing the Dutch fondness for rijsttafel, made it a standard menu item. Rijsttafels are only a small part of the menu in an Indonesian restaurant, and there is a trend among the Dutch to look down on them as being just for tourists; the Dutch generally have a good understanding of Indonesian cuisine and prefer to order an individual dish rather than the mixed hash of flavors of a rijsttafel. However, rijsttafels remain popular, and many Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Thai restaurants in Holland have copied the idea.\nRijsttafel is an acquired taste, and unless you already have a stomach for both Chinese and Indian cooking, you may not like much of what you eat. But to be in Holland and not at least try a rijsttafel is as much a pity as it would be to miss seeing Rembrandt\'s The Night Watch while you had the chance. Besides, with more than 20 different dishes on the table, you\'re bound to find a few you enjoy.\nThe basic concept of a rijsttafel is to eat a bit of this and a bit of that, blending the flavors and textures. A simple, unadorned bed of rice is the base and the mediator between spicy meats and bland vegetables or fruits, between sweet-and-sour tastes, soft-and-crunchy textures. Although a rijsttafel for one is possible, this feast is better shared by two or by a table full of people. In the case of a solitary diner or a couple, a 17-dish rijsttafel will be enough food; with four or more, order a 24- or 30-dish rijsttafel and you can experience the total taste treat.\nBefore you begin to imagine 30 dinner-size plates of food, it\'s important to mention that the dishes used to serve an Indonesian meal are small and the portions served are gauged by the number of people expected to share them. Remember, the idea is to have tastes of many things rather than a full meal of any single item. Also, there are no separate courses in an Indonesian rijsttafel. Once your table has been set with a row of low, Sterno-powered plate warmers, all 17 or 24 or 30 dishes arrive all at one time, like a culinary avalanche, the sweets along with the sours and the spicy, so you\'re left to plot your own course through the extravaganza. (Beware, however, of one very appealing dish of sauce with small chunks of what looks to be bright-red onion--that is sambal badjak, or simply sambal, and it\'s hotter than hot.)\nAmong the customary dishes and ingredients of a rijsttafel are loempia (classic Chinese-style egg rolls); satay, or sateh (small kebabs of pork, grilled and served with a spicy peanut sauce); perkedel (meatballs); gado-gado (vegetables in peanut sauce); daging smoor (beef in soy sauce); babi ketjap (pork in soy sauce); kroepoek (crunchy, puffy shrimp toast); serundeng (fried coconut); roedjak manis (fruit in sweet sauce); and pisang goreng (fried banana).\nSource: Frommer\'s Amsterdam, 13th Edition\n(Dutch: ""rice table""), an elaborate meal of Indonesian dishes developed during the Dutch colonial era. It is popular In The Netherlands and at both Dutch and Indonesian restaurants abroad.\nIn essence the rijsttafel consists of rice and foods to accompany it: curried meats, fish, chicken, vegetables, fruits, relishes, pickles, sauces, condiments, nuts, eggs, and so on. The dinner is served a plate of rice and chooses from among the side dishes to achieve a balance of salty, spicy, sweet, and sour accompaniments. A rijsttafel of 40 dishes was not uncommon, the meal sometimes taking three to four hours to consume. -Encyclopedia Britannica-\nsource: Bandung Restaurant , WI.\nSatay Ayam (Chicken Satay)\nServes approximately six people, 10 to 12 as part of a rijsttafel\nSatay, quick-grilled over a roadside fire, is popular street food today in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Cambodia, but its home is Indonesia.

Sumatrans like it hot and dry, while Javanese like it sweeter with more gravy. While, a Javanese herself, Tuti leans toward the style of Padang in Sumatra, considered by most the source of the best food in the country. Out of sympathy for her guests, she cuts back on the hot pepper. But if you\'d like to sample true Padang-style eating, load up on the sambal.\n1 medium onion chopped\n5 cloves garlic, chopped\n1 Tb. fresh ginger, chopped\n5 fresh red hot chillies chopped or 2 Tb. crushed dry chili\n2 cups coconut milk\n1 1/2 tsp. salt\n1 tsp. ground turmeric\n2 tsp. ground coriander\n2 tsp. galanga powder (see ingredients list)\n4 tsp. paprika\n6 kemiri (see ingredients list)\n6 kaffir lime leaves (see ingredients list)\n1 stalk of fresh lemon grass or 1 Tb. lemon grass powder (see ingredients list)\n1/2 cup tamarind juice\n1/2 cup water\n3 lbs. round or chuck steak cut into strips approximately 1 1/2 wide and 2 1/2 long\nMix all ingredients but meat in a blender or food processor. Add to a large saucepan, add meat and bring quickly to a boil.\nReduce heat to moderate, stirring occasionally until sauce reduces by one-half. Turn heat to low and continue cooking until gravy is almost dry stirring frequently to ensure mixture does not stick to the pan.\nAllow meat to fry in remaining oil until it is dark brown. Cooking time approximately two hours. Serve with white rice.\nKari Ikan (Fish Curry)\nServes 4 people, more for a rijsttafel\nNo sampling of Indonesian dishes would be complete without seafood or a curry. Syamsul and Beverley Bachri, owners of\nBachri\'s in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania provide us with the perfect marriage, a fish curry, and a simple one at that.\n1 Tb. oil\n1 onion, sliced\n1 tsp. grated fresh ginger\n8 kemiri ground\n1 tsp. curry powder\n2 tsp. kecap manis (sweet soy sauce)\n2 tsp. lemon juice\n1 cup water\n4 fish fillets\n2 scallions, chopped\nHeat oil in a wok, add sliced onion, and stir-fry until tender. Add ginger, kemiri, and curry powder, and stir-fry over low\nheat for 3 minutes.\nAdd kecap manis, lemon juice, and water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for about 3 minutes.\nAdd fish fillets in a single layer in the wok. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes on each side or until the fish is done. Place on a platter, sprinkle with chopped scallions, and serve with sambal and sliced cucumber salad along with white rice.\nSemur Daging (Slices Of Beef In Soya Sauce)\nServes 3 or 4, more for a rijstaffel\nOn my first night in Jakarta, my hostess prepared semur. No doubt she felt it would be easy on my wimpy western palate, but I found its sweetness strange and exotic. Of course a palate trained in the Midwest during the fifties and sixties would have found anything exotic! Now that I have toughened up, I know to serve a dish like this with plenty of sambal for a balance between sweet and hot. This is Syamsul and Beverley Bachri\'s version.\n1 lb. beef roast, thinly sliced\n2 shallots, sliced\n1 clove garlic, finely chopped\n2 Tb. kecap manis (sweet soy sauce)\n2 Tb. butter\n2 hard-boiled eggs, halved\n2 potatos, thinly sliced\n2 tomatos, peeled and chopped\n4 scallions, chopped\nSalt and pepper to taste\nPinch of nutmeg\nThinly sliced fried onion\nFry shallots and garlic in butter until lightly browned. Add meat and potato slices, and saute briefly. Add the tomato, soy sauce, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Mix well.\nCover and cook for 5 minutes. Add eggs and cook for 5 minutes more. Add scallions just prior to serving and garnish with fried onions. Serve with white rice.\nAnd at last, the food that gives Indonesian cuisine its spark. There are sambals of all sorts to accompany different kinds of dishes. Some are used as an ingredient in dishes like sambal goreng ikan (fish fried in sambal). The heat can come from fresh red chillies for from bottled chilli paste. This is Syamsul and Beverley\'s basic recipe. Modify it to suit your needs.\n2 large tomatoes\n2 large Spanish onions\n1 tsp. terasi (see ingredients list)\nSeveral cloves of garlic\n1/2 cup sambal oelek (raw chili paste) (see ingredients list)\n1/4 cup oil\nSalt and pepper to taste\nBlend together in a food processor the tomatoes, onions, terasi, garlic and sambal oelek until slightly chunky. Do not\nPlace mixture in a pot, preferable with a non stick surface with the oil, salt and pepper and lightly boil until no water surfaces. The sambal is done when the consistency is constant and it no longer seperates.\n(For Sambal Manis - Sweet Sambal -- a very common variation on the theme, add 1/4 cup of Kecap Manis when the sambal is almost done.)\nTamarind juice is made from block tamarind concentrate sold in Asian stores, some supermarkets and by mail order. To make tamarind juice, break off a piece of the block and soak in warm water for 10 to 15 minutes. Squeeze and loosen the remainder of the flesh from the seeds and strain. Use a ratio of approximately 1:4 tamarind concentrate to water.\nCoconut milk can be found canned at Asian groceries, many supermarkets and by mail order. Mae Ploy from Thailand is the richest brand available.\nGalanga (also known as laos) powder, the ground root of a rhizome related to ginger, can be found in Asian groceries, some supermarkets and by mail order.\nKemiri or candlenut is ground and used as a thickening agent in Indonesian food. It can be found at Asian groceries and by mail order. Macadamia nut will provide approximately the same texture, but not the same flavor. Don\'t eat kemiri raw! They contain a mildly toxic substance which is destroyed by cooking.\nKaffir lime leaves can be found frozen and dried at Asian food stores. The frozen ones are more flavorful.\nLemon grass/lemon grass powder are both found in Asian groceries. Fresh lemon grass, also found in farmer\'s markets in cities with large Asian populations, is far superior to the powder and easy to grow in mild climates. Try rooting some stalks in water and planting them outdoors.\nTerasi or shrimp paste can be found in Asian groceries and by mail order. In a pinch, substitute Thai or Vietnamese shrimp paste or even Filipino bagoong, all of which may be more available.\nSambal Oelek or raw chili paste is available in Asian markets and by mail order. Like many of these ingredients, you can get them from Syamsul and Beverley by ordering on-line.\nSource : Sally\'s Place\nMore Indonesian recipes can be found as accompanion to Rijsttafel.

I came across a good place to start with and has a variety of indonesian recipes in it HERE.', 'Bibimbap was recorded as goldongban. Its existence came into being early on as its name as goldongban was confirmed through records relating to figures during the reign of King Sejo (1455-1468), the early period of the Joseon Dynasty. Literature which refers to bibimbap in Hangul is the Siuijeonseo written at the end of the 1800s. In this work, bibimbap is recorded as bubimbap and goldongban. The “gol” in goldongban means to mix, “dong” means to keep. “Goldong” means to mix together various objects. Thus, goldongban means a dish that mixes together various relishes with already cooked rice.\nChange in the name of bibimbap\nGoldongjiban : During the reign of King Sunjo, the 23rd king of the Joseon Dynasty, the term goldongban appears in Dongjidal volume of Dongguksaesigi (1849) written by Hong Seok Mo.\nBubimbap : Written by an unknown author, the manuscript, Siuijeonseo (end of the 1800s), one of the most representative food literature of noble families, refers to bubimbap. The Sino-Korean word “gol” means dizzy, “dong” means bibimbap. “Goldong” means to mix together various objects. In the Joseon Yori-Jebeop written by Bang Sin Young, it is written as bubimbap. Since its first publication in 1917, this book has been expanded and reprinted to over nine editions in 1939.\nBibimbap : Today, the term bibimbap is used. In terms of literature, the name of bibimbap has changed many times. However, there is not much difference in its meaning to mix together various relishes with rice. Ingredients used in bibimbap have significantly changed during the 100 year period between the 1800s and the 1900s. During such 100 year period, not only did the production of food ingredients increase, it is believed that it is not entirely inaccurate to consider that the Korean food culture was completed during that period. Yet, there are a few differing claims as to the origin of bibimbap.\nSeveral theories on the origin of bibimbap\n1. Royal Court Food\nIn the sura, which is referred to as the King’s meal during the Joseon Dynasty, there are four different\nTypes which are the white sura, red sura, five grains sura and bibim. It is viewed that bibimbap was the King’s meal for lunch or when the royal family went to the royal court.\n2. Ceremonial Food\nIt is viewed that bibimbap originated from the ceremony of sin-in gongsik whereby food arranged at various ancestral rites and ceremonies, which took place in the traditional society, were shared with ancestral spirits.\n3. Farming Season Food\nDuring the farming season, meals were served many times during the day. It is viewed that bibimbap originated from mixing various dishes in one bowl as it was difficult to setup a well-prepared table for each meal and bring sufficient number of plates.\norigin of bibimbap as a farming season food is well described in Choi Seung Beom’s Lanrokgi\nIt is natural for food from Jeolla-do where the mountains and the sea are evenly placed, are gathered from three places where food are to be found. During the farming season, when the farmer’s wife carries the cooked rice out to the fields, how is it possible for her to go out with all the dishes even if she uses a hamper or basket. So, a way was conceived by putting rice in a bowl like a large pottery bowl and placing various dishes on top one by one with a bowl of red pepper paste. When she would go out to the field carrying the bowl with a spoon, it was easy for her to cross the ditch and furrows of the rice field. With the out door table set up on the embankment around the field under the skies, it was bibimbap and it is praised as a rationalized menu.”\nThis is the part where it is found that the Jeonju bibimbap originates from the farming society\n4. Food for New Year’s Eve of the lunar year\nAs a way to welcome the New Year’s Eve of the lunar year, it is viewed that left over vegetables and rice were mixed together and served to get rid of left over food from the past year']"	['<urn:uuid:2d0a8295-5982-4879-af20-70b6da5dd58a>', '<urn:uuid:fac4ac92-4e1b-479c-8cb4-0d45b3ed87ac>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	29	115	2795
85	What exactly happens when there is no connection on the input lines of a standard decoder, and how does a priority decoder solve this problem?	When there is no connection on the input lines of a standard decoder, it incorrectly considers this as logic 0 and makes the bit O0 high. A priority decoder solves this problem by having an extra input pin called 'Enable' (E). When there is no connection on the input lines, the enable bit becomes 0, which ensures all output lines remain zero.	['Decoder is type of combinational Circuit which decodes a small bit value into large bit value. It is normally used in combination with encoders which does exactly the opposite of what a decoder does, so read about Encoders here before you proceed with Decoders. Again just like Encoders there are many types of Decoders as well but the number of output lines in a decoder will always be more than the number of input lines. We will learn how a decoder works and how we can build one for our project in this tutorial.\nBasic Principe of Decoder:\nAs told earlier, the decoder is just a counter part of an Encoder. It takes a particular number of binary values as inputs and decodes then into more lines by using logic. A sample decoder is shown below which takes in 2 Lines as input and converts them to 4 Lines.\nAnother rule of thumb with Decoders is that, if the number of inputs is considered as n (here n = 2) then the number of output will always be equal to 2n (22 =4) which is four in our case. The Decoder has 2 input lines and 4 output lines; hence this type of Decoder is called as 2:4 Decoders. The two input pins are named as I1 and I0 and the four output pins are named from O0 to O3 as shown above.\nIt is also important to know that an ordinary Decoder like the one shown here has a drawback of not able to distinguish between the condition of both inputs being zero (not connected to other circuits) and both inputs being low (logic 0). This drawback can be solved using a Priority Decoder which we will learn later in this article. The truth table of an ordinary Decoder is shown below\nFrom the decoder truth table we can write the Boolean expression for each Output line, just follow where the output gets high and form an AND logic based on the values of I1 and I0. It is very similar to the Encoder method, but here we use the AND logic instead of the OR logic. The Boolean Expression for all four lines are given below, where the symbol (.) represents AND logic and the symbol (‘) represents NOT Logic\nO0 = I1’.I0’ O1 = I1’.I0 O2 = I1.I0’ O3 = I1.I0\nNow that we have all the four expression we can convert these expressions into a combinational logic gate circuit using the AND gates and NOT gates. Simply use the AND gates in place of (.) and a NOT gate (inverted logic) in place of a (‘) and you will get the following logic diagram.\nLet us build the 2:4 decoder circuit diagram on breadboard and check how it is working in real life. To make it work as a hardware you have to use the logic gate IC like 7404 for NOT gate and the 7408 for the AND gate. The two inputs I0 and I1 is provided through a push button and the output is observed through LED lights. Once you make the connection on breadboard it would look something like this in the picture below\nThe board is powered by an external +5V supply, which in turns powers the Gate IC though the Vcc (pin 14) and ground (pin 7) pins. The input is given by push buttons, when it is pressed it is logic 1 and when not pressed it gives logic 0, a pull down resistor of value 1k is also added along the input lines to prevent the pins from floating condition. The output lines (O0 to O3) are given through these red LED lights, if they glow it is logic 1 else it is logic 0. The complete working of this decoder circuit is shown in the video below\nNote that the truth table for each input is displayed at the top left corner and the LED also glows in the same orderly fashion. Similarly we can also create combinational logic diagram for all type of Decoders and build them on hardware like this. You can also look into the readily available decoder IC’s if your project suits one.\nDrawbacks of standard Decoders:\nJust like an Encoder the standard Decoder also suffers from the same problem, if both the inputs are not connected (logic X) the output will not remain as zero. Instead the Decoder will consider it as logic 0 and the bit O0 will be made high.\nSo we use the Priority Decoder to overcome that problem, this type of decoder has an extra input pin labeled as “E” (Enable) which will be connected with the valid pin of the priority Decoder. The block diagram for a priority Decoder is shown below.\nThe truth table for a Priority Encoder is also shown below, here X represents no connection and ‘1’ represents logic high and ‘0’ represents logic low. Notice that the enable bit is 0 when there is no connection on the Input lines and hence the output lines will also remain zero. This way we will be able to overcome the above mentioned drawback.\nAs always from the truth table we can drive the Boolean expression for the output lines O0 to O3. The Boolean Expression for the above truth table is shown below. If you take a closer look you can notice that the expression is as same as that of a normal 2:4 decoder but the Enable bit (E) has been made to AND with the expression.\nO0 = E.I1’.I0’ O1 = E.I1’.I0 O2 = E.I1.I0’ O3 = E.I1.I0\nThe combinational logic diagram for the above Boolean expression can be built using a couple of Inverters (NOT Gates) and 3-input AND gates. Just replace the (‘) symbol with inverters and the (.) symbol with AND gate and you will get the following Logic diagram.\nThere are also some higher order Decoders like the 3:8 Decoder and the 4:16 Decoder which is more commonly used. These Decoders are often used in IC packages to complexity of the circuit. It is also very common to combine lower order decoders like the 2:4 Decoders to form a higher order Decoder. For instance we know that a 2:4 Decoder has 2 Inputs (I0 and I1) and 4 Outputs (O0 to O3) and a 3:8 Decoder has three inputs (I0 to I2) and Eight Outputs (O0 to O7). We can use the following formulae to calculate the number of lower order decoders (2:4) required to form a higher order decoder like 3:8 Decoder.\nRequired number of Lower Order Decoder = m2 / m1 Where, m2 -> number of outputs for lower order Decoder m1 -> number of outputs for higher order Decoder\nIn our case, the value of m1 will be 4 and the value of m2 will be 8, so applying these values in the above formulae we get\nRequired number of 2:4 Decoder for 3:8 Decoder = 8/4 = 2\nNow we know that we will need two 2:4 Decoder to form a 3:8 Decoder, but how should these two be connected to gather. The below block diagram shows just that\nAs you can see the inputs A0 and A1 is connected as parallel inputs for both the decoders and then the Enable pin of the first Decoder is made to act as A2 (third input). The Inverted signal of A2 is given to the Enable pin of second decoder to get the outputs Y0 to Y3. Here the outputs Y0 to Y3 is referred as Lower four minterms and the outputs Y4 to Y7 is referred as higher four minterms. The lower order minterms are obtained from the second decoder and the higher order minterms are obtained from the first decoder. Although one noticeable drawback in this type of combinational design is that, the Decoder will not have an Enable pin which makes it susceptible to the problems which we have discussed earlier.\nSimilar to a 3:8 Decoder a 4:16 Decoder can also be constructed by combining two 3:8 Decoder. For a 4: 16 Decoder we will have four inputs (A0 to A3) and sixteen outputs (Y0 to Y15). Whereas, for a 3:8 Decoder we will have only three inputs (A0 to A2).\nWe have already used the formulae to calculate the number of Decoder required, in this case the value of m1 will be 8 since 3:8 decoder has 8 outputs and the value of m2 will be 16 since the 4:16 decoder has 16 outputs, so applying these values in the above formulae we get\nRequired number of 3:8 Decoder for 4:16 Decoder = 16/8= 2\nTherefore we require two 3:8 Decoder for constructing a 4:16 Decoder, the arrangement of these two 3:8 Decoder will also be similar to the one we did earlier. The block diagram for connecting these two 3:8 Decoder together is shown below.\nHere the outputs Y0 to Y7 is considered as lower eight minterms and the output from Y8 to Y16 is considered as higher eight minterms. The lower right minterms are directly created using the inputs A0,A1 and A2. The same signals is also given to the three inputs of the first Decoder, but the Enable pin of the first decoder is used as the fourth input Pin (A3). The inverted signal of the fourth input A3 is given to the enable pin of the second Decoder. The first decoder outputs the higher eight minterms value.\nA Decoder is usually used in combination with an Encoder and hence they both share the same applications. Without Decoders and Encoders out modern electronics like mobile phone and Laptops would have not been possible. Few important applications of Decoders are listed below.\n- Sequencing Signal Application\n- Timing Signal Applications\n- Network lines\n- Memory elements\n- Telephone Networks']	['<urn:uuid:c64bebb5-d6e4-4981-b52e-53bc7c908736>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	25	62	1637

Bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals like Strontium-89 and Samarium-153 exchange with calcium in hydroxyapatite and concentrate in osteoblastic lesions, providing palliation in 75-80% of hormone-refractory patients. X-rays are the fastest and easiest way for physicians to assess broken bones, requiring at least two images from different angles, and can also help identify bone cancer and arthritis.

Discovered more than a century ago, x-rays can produce diagnostic images of the human body on film or digitally on a computer screen.\nX-ray imaging is the fastest and easiest way for a physician to view and assess broken bones. At least two images (from different angles) are taken and often three images are needed if the problem is around a joint (knee, elbow or wrist). X-rays also play a key role in guiding orthopedic surgery and in the treatment of sports-related injuries. X-ray may uncover more advanced forms of cancer in bones, although early screening for cancer findings requires other methods.\nWhat are some common uses of the procedure?\nProbably the most common use of bone radiographs is to assist the physician in identifying and treating fractures. Images of the injury can show even very fine hairline fractures or bone chips, while images produced after treatment ensure that a fracture has been properly aligned and stabilized for healing. Bone x-rays are essential tools in orthopedic surgery, such as spinal repair, joint replacements or fracture reductions.\nX-ray images can be used to diagnose and monitor the progression of degenerative diseases such as arthritis. They also play an important role in the detection and diagnosis of cancer, although usually computed tomography (CT) or MRI is better at defining the extent and the nature of a suspected cancer. On regular x-rays severe osteoporosis can be visible, but bone density determination for early loss of bone mineral is usually done on specialized, more sensitive equipment.\nHow should I prepare for the procedure?\nWhat does the x-ray equipment look like?\nHow does the procedure work?\nHow is the procedure performed?\nWhen your x-rays are completed you will be asked to wait until the technologist checks the images for adequate exposure and motion.\nWhat will I experience during the x-ray procedure?\nWho interprets the results and how do I get them?\nWhat are the benefits vs. risks?\n- X-ray imaging is useful to diagnose bone injury and disease, such as fractures, bone infections, arthritis and cancer.\n- Because x-ray imaging is fast and easy, it is particularly useful in emergency diagnosis and treatment.\n- X-ray equipment is relatively inexpensive and widely available in physician offices, ambulatory care centers, nursing homes and other locations, making it convenient for both patients and physicians.\n- X-rays are a type of invisible electromagnetic radiation and create no sensation when they pass through the body. Modern x-ray techniques use only a fraction of the x-ray dose that was required in the early days of radiology.\n- Women should always inform their doctor or x-ray technologist if there is any possibility that they are pregnant.\n- During a single x-ray exposure, a patient is exposed to approximately 20 milliroentgens of radiation. To put this into perspective, we are all exposed to approximately 100 milliroentgens of radiation each year from sources like the ultraviolet rays of the sun and small traces of radioactive isotopes, such as uranium found in soil.\nRadiation risks are further minimized by:\n- The use of high-speed x-ray film that requires only very small amounts of radiation to produce an optimal image.\n- Technique standards established by national and international guidelines that have been designed and are continually reviewed by national and international radiology protection councils.\n- Modern, state-of-the-art x-ray systems (including mammography systems, angiographic equipment, labs and CT scanners) that have very tightly controlled x-ray beams with significant filtration and x-ray dose control methods. Scatter or stray radiation is minimized and those parts of a patient’s body not being imaged receive minimal exposure.\nWhat are the limitations of Bone Radiography?\nSend us an email or contact us directly.\n800 Bathurst St, Suite 304\nToronto, Ontario M5R 3M8\n(416) 531 1128']"	['<urn:uuid:8b2f3329-1f41-4234-ba02-080e394ec3da>', '<urn:uuid:5ccd16c1-3102-4bb0-b669-037b3b0d1472>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	11	53	1751
87	I own a small business selling replacement parts for machines, and I was wondering if there's any future in wind turbine maintenance and repairs?	Yes, there is significant growth potential in wind turbine servicing. As the industry matures, more turbines need servicing, upgrading, and eventual replacement. According to MAKE forecasts, the global service segment is expected to grow by 9 to 10 percent per year on average over the next ten years. The service segment is becoming increasingly important for companies like Vestas, which saw 15 percent growth in this area last year.	['Danish wind turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems has leapt to the top of the U.S. wind market, overtaking General Electric in new capacity installed last year, although slower demand growth and doubts over political support could threaten its position.\nVestas came back from the brink of bankruptcy just four years ago. Now the wind industry is entering a new phase with slower growth and more steady demand for turbines, prompting producers to turn to servicing and replacement of older wind turbines to grow revenue.\nSiemens installed 1.24GW in 2014 and 1.21GW in 2015, according to AWEA. It had 605MW under construction on 31 December last year – versus merger partner Gamesa (830MW) and Nordex (738MW). It also had 624MW in advanced development.\nSiemens installed turbines for only four customers in 2016: MidAmerican Energy, part of billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, Apex Clean Energy, OWN Energy and Invenergy. AWEA lists only two for projects under construction: Pattern Energy and Infinity Wind Power.\nMidAmerican, for years the top customer for Siemens, shocked the industry last year by turning to Vestas to supply its newest 2GW wind project in Iowa.\nVestas, the world’s biggest wind turbine maker, supplied 43 percent of the 8.2 GW of wind power capacity connected to the U.S. power grid last year, the American Wind Energy Association said in a quarterly report. That was up from 33 percent in 2015 and just 12 percent in 2014.\nBy contrast, General Electric’s market share stood at 42 percent in 2016, down from well over half in 2014, the association said, although GE remains the market leader in terms of overall installed capacity in the United States.\n“It is definitely our ambition to at least keep our market share,” Vestas Chief Executive Anders Runevad said in an interview.\nWind energy has surpassed hydropower as the biggest source of renewable electricity in the United States, according to the association, helped by tax credits under Barack Obama’s administration.\nVestas reported record global revenues for 2016 on Wednesday but warned of lower orders in the United States this year, saying rapid growth in demand in the industry generally could be coming to an end as the wind market matures.\nThe Danish company is set to lose its status as the world’s top wind turbine maker after Germany’s Siemens and Spain’s Gamesa agreed to combine their assets in the sector.\nBoth GE and Siemens depend on orders from a few large customers such as NextEra Energy, while Vestas supplies a broader range.\n“They’ve been very aggressive and maintained a diverse order book,” said Luke Lewandowski, research manager at MAKE, a consultancy.\nNumbers from MAKE, which include grid-connected turbines from wind farm projects that are not yet fully completed, show that GE held 42 percent of the market last year with Vestas second at 41 percent.\nIn June, Vestas secured a significant order for 1,000 wind turbines from MidAmerican Energy, a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary which had until then been a Siemens client.\n“Vestas has been really flexible in thinking and adapting themselves to the wishes of the clients in terms of location, type of turbines and the services around it,” said Danny van Doesburg, senior portfolio manager at APG Asset Management, the seventh biggest shareholder in Vestas.\n“We have widened the customer base quite substantially in the United States,” Runevad said. “We have managed to penetrate further into the big U.S.-based utilities.”\nStill, risks remain for the the world’s biggest wind turbine maker, which supplies the U.S. market from four factories in Colorado.\nVestas was one of the hardest hit European stocks, plunging as much as 10 percent, after Trump’s election pointed to an uncertain future for the U.S. wind market, the company’s largest.\nAfter a record year in 2016, Vestas warned on Wednesday of lower order intake in the United States this year and said rapid growth in demand could be coming to an end, noting “signs of increased maturity of the wind market.”\nVestas said that the Production Tax Credit (PTC), which was extended for five years in December 2015, could hit its U.S. business in the near term as it gives investors more time to build their wind farm projects, reducing pressure to get projects built next year.\nTax credits that are already awarded seem safe, but there is now more uncertainty about future government support.\n“How (the U.S. market) will pan out over the years is still very hard to predict,” Runevad said. He seeks to position Vestas for high growth in the service segment, which grew by 15 percent last year, helped by the acquisition of two service providers.\nAs the industry matures, more turbines need servicing, upgrading and eventually replacement. MAKE forecasts the global service segment to grow by 9 to 10 percent per year on average over the next ten years.\n“The whole service element of the wind industry can be a potential trigger for the investment case,” said APG’s van Doesburg.']	['<urn:uuid:d742ef75-e8bf-4fad-9d88-ff17ce3496ae>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	24	69	823
88	I'm building tools for developers - which handles plugins better, Backstage or Jenkins?	Jenkins has a stronger plugin ecosystem with over a thousand available plugins and new ones being added weekly. While Backstage is also extensible with plugins, it requires more custom development and adaptation. Jenkins plugin maintainers actively welcome contributions to existing plugins, making it easier to extend functionality through collaboration rather than creating new plugins from scratch.	"['This article is the first part of the “Evaluating Backstage” series. It covers all the basics around developer portals, introduces Backstage development, and explores how it can help your organization be more efficient and secure.\nBackstage is a developer portal that acts as a centralized hub for your organization, providing access to documentation, infrastructure, tooling, and code standards. It gives developers everything they need to create and manage their projects in a consistent and standardized manner. To understand why Backstage exists, and why you should care about it at all, you must first understand the pain points it’s trying to alleviate.\nPicture this: you’re working on a project that needs to talk to some service, but no one is entirely sure who owns it anymore. Asking around only leads you to out-of-date documentation, and eventually you realize the code owner left the company months ago. You reverse engineer enough to identify the necessary infrastructure changes and raise a ticket. It takes days to get a response, only for you to find out that some crucial data is missing. And now your manager is asking when your project will be ready.\nStories like this are all too common in the developer world and are the inevitable result of growing organizations. There is no magic bullet for these issues, but developer portals such as Backstage can help to alleviate them.\nWith a developer portal, individual team members no longer have to solve every challenge they face on their own because the portal enables better collaboration and communication across the whole team. For example, the portal allows administrators to define and enforce standardized practices for all projects. This way, developers can focus on problem-solving without having to worry about managing processes and adhering to different standards. To give a second example, if a new developer joins the organization and needs to create a simple function, the portal guides them on best practices, monitoring tools, code standardization, and accessing necessary resources like database secrets.\nWhat Is Backstage?\nBackstage is an open source developer portal originally created by Spotify for its internal use. It was designed to allow their developers to maintain the highly dynamic and autonomous development flow Spotify has become known for. Backstage does this by helping you to organize and manage all the software your company produces. Recounting the entire history of Backstage is beyond the scope of this article, but it has been extensively documented in other places. The tl;dr is that Spotify donated its developer portal to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in 2020, making it open source. It’s designed from the ground up to be flexible and allow every organization to adapt it to their own needs. In Spotify’s own words:\n“It’s a developer portal powered by a centralized software catalog—with a plugin architecture that makes it endlessly extensible and customizable.”\nBackstage provides a central place where you can find a registry of all deployed services, APIs, and infrastructure, as well as their documentation, and see how they interact with each other.\nYou no longer have to wonder who owns specific pieces of code, ask around only to be directed to out-of-date Confluence pages, or find that the dev you need to speak to no longer works at the company. You can view all your components in one central space and easily see which components are dependent on one another. Additionally, you’ll have access to the source code’s location and the name of its owner.\nAll of that is great by itself, but what really makes Backstage shine is another of its core functionalities: software templating. The core component of Backstage that deals with this is called Scaffolder. It provides a series of guidelines and restrictions that allow you to create templates that developers can use to deploy code. In these templates, you can bake in whatever your organization deems valuable for every type of component you want to create.\nFor example, you might want every serverless function to incorporate a specific monitoring tool, or you may want to ensure that developers don’t forget to include a README file in their repositories. With software templates, developers can simply fill out a form and follow a few clicks to create their projects. The templates will automatically enforce the guidelines you defined, publish the repository to the appropriate workspace, and register the project in the software catalog.\nIn the example provided earlier, this means you could create a template for the new developer to use, and they would simply log in to Backstage using your organization’s LDAP. Once in there, they would locate the relevant template and provide it with all the data it requests. Backstage would then create a new GitHub repository that contains all the base code you usually need for such cases: layers, libraries, the CI/CD pipeline configuration file, automatically generated documentation, and so on, all within minutes.\nAdditionally, as time passes, a large open source community continues to grow behind Backstage. There are plenty of plugins that make it easier to have your first working proof-of-concept app by providing open source solutions to common scenarios like resource visualization or cost reports.\nThis kind of flexibility has made Backstage a very attractive tool for many high-profile companies and startups alike, like Expedia, CVS Health, Siemens, LinkedIn, and Fiverr. Netflix also uses Backstage for its internal operations. If you would like to take a more in-depth look at how companies use Backstage, you can explore the Expedia example.\nThis all sounds really good so far, right? Well, it’s not as easy as it seems. If you have been reading about Backstage, you might have already come across different tutorials on how to make a simple application run locally and how to install plugins created by other people. Getting started is pretty straightforward. However, as soon as you start to move away from the out-of-the-box functions and try to implement more custom use cases, it starts to become a bit (or a lot) more confusing.\nBackstage is not just an application or SaaS that you can purchase and expect to work right out of the box. You have to think of Backstage as more like a framework than a fully-fledged application to implement in your organization. To implement it successfully, you will have to treat it like a product that requires support and an active team of developers. It’s a project that will need your team’s full engagement.\nYou have to write code, modify the existing app code, and make it yours so it adapts to your use case—but at the same time, this is what makes Backstage powerful. As you progress, it will become yours and be tailored exactly to what your organization needs. All the effort put into it, plus the fact that no one knows your processes better than you do, means that it will tackle exactly the pain points you care most about. You can then contribute back to the open source project and help grow its ecosystem even more.\nWhen adopting Backstage, it’s also very important to think beyond technical details and code. As a developer, it’s natural to get excited by the framework’s endless possibilities and start going wild, implementing every impressive feature you can think of. However, it’s essential to remember that there is little to no value in creating an awesome, shiny tool that no one will ever use because the user experience is bad. The portal must align seamlessly with the current workflow and be easily understandable. In a sense, you must do internal marketing and evangelize other teams about its usefulness if you want them to buy in. This means you need to think about their needs, user experience, and goals when you are building your portal.\nBecome familiar with Backstage, read the documentation, read some articles explaining how to do things you would like to do - we will have lots of ideas to share with you as the series develops - and define specific metrics of success from the beginning. These will be useful for how you’ll judge if Backstage is working well for your organization. Metrics like adoption rate, enhanced productivity, and automated processes will be specific to your organization, but measuring these will provide insights to guide you and keep you focused on what really matters to you. They will also make it easier to explain to management the added value you are bringing to the organization with this Backstage thing you keep talking about.\nIn this introductory article, you’ve learned about the basics of developer portals and Backstage as a modular open source framework that allows extensions with your own or third-party plugins. On top of all this, if you’ve already dipped into the Backstage documentation, you might be feeling overwhelmed. The documentation sometimes assumes you already know what you’re doing and can be complicated for Backstage newcomers.\nDon’t be too hard on yourself if you don’t get it right away. The rest of this series will break down the various elements of Backstage to make them a bit easier to digest. As you follow along, everything will start making sense, and you’ll soon be contributing to the Backstage community yourself and helping to enhance this great framework.\nIf this article has piqued your interest, you can continue your journey with the second installment, Evaluating Backstage: How Backstage Works.', 'One of Jenkins\' main strengths is its plugins (and their openness). Over a thousand are already available, and brand new plugins become available every week or so. As such, there\'s quite likely one or more plugins which cover your needs.\nIn case some existing plugins partly cover your needs, we encourage you to contribute directly to these plugins rather than starting new ones from scratch. Profusion of plugins is good, profusion of plugins doing the same thing or so is not as good\nWhat does this mean? Well, two things:\n- That plugin maintainers should do their best to welcome contributions on their plugins (see below);\n- That people with specific needs should try to work on existing plugins preferably to creating brand new ones, when applicable, of course (see below).\nWhat if my idea seems unique?\nEven if, having read the sections below, you believe that you have a unique need to write a plugin, consider the following:\n- Search the plugin list here or inside Jenkins for something that could potentially be similar\n- Search the list of plugin repositories for something possibly similar\n- Search Google for people discussing similar ideas; perhaps there\'s a plugin not published in the update centre that someone could share\n- Search the users\' and developers\' mailing list archives for similar ideas\n- Talk to us! Many people start writing plugins, then ask us for hosting, only to find out that there was another plugin they had missed; or we may be able to recommend a good approach to use when writing your plugin.\nGet in touch via the jenkinsci-dev mailing list, or stop by IRC\nPlugin maintainers: Welcome changes from contributors!\nMaintainers, have you read the two following sections in Hosting Plugins?\nThese two sections are really important as they allow potential contributors to quickly have an access to your plugin\'s source code and documentation in order to contribute to it.\nApart from that, we also recommend applying the following best practices (if you see any other, please add them):\n- Document your code:\nNothing special to say here, having documented code helps people contributing to it. Would you imagine writing a plugin without having Jenkins\' javadoc? The same applies for your plugin\n- Clearly identify the license(s) which applies to your plugin:\nLicensing is really important when it comes to contributing code. As such, we encourage you to follow one or several of the following practices:\n(1) Add a license header at the top of each of your source code files;\n(2) Add a LICENSE file at the root of your Maven project;\n(3) Fill the\n<licenses>section of your POM.\nIf nothing is defined, your code will be assumed to fall under the MIT license terms.\n- Welcome change:\nWell, nothing to say here also... Avoid the ""NoDeByMe"" (not developed by me) phobia. Jenkins would not be what it is today if it was reluctant to changes\n- Emphasize the fact that your plugin gets orphan:\nIf you don\'t maintain your plugin anymore, emphasize it in the wiki. We\'re sure many people will be happy to take over for you.\n- Finally, answer e-mails:\nThis principle actually goes along with welcoming changes. If somebody sends you a mail to contribute to your plugin, pay attention to it, and welcome it.\nPeople with different needs: Work on existing plugins!\nBefore starting a brand new plugin, we encourage you to do the following:\n- Search for existing plugins that cover your needs.\n- If some plugins partly cover your needs:\n- Check if the licensing terms are compliant with what you expect (note: most of Jenkins\' plugins are covered by the MIT license);\n- Take a look at the plugin\'s source code/documentation to see if you can, technically speaking, bring in the changes you need;\n- Contact the maintainer (both directly and through the Jenkins developer discussion list) to engage a discussion on how to contribute the changes you need. Some of the maintainers will just say ""go ahead and bring in your changes"", some will be happy to provide you with more help, some will even possibly code for you.\nIf you don\'t get an answer from the maintainer after a few days, contact him/her/them again and be patient for a few more days as he/she/they might simply be away for some time.\nIf you really don\'t get an answer (or a negative one), well, it might be time for you to start your own plugin.\n- If you cannot find a plugin that looks similar to what you need, drop an email to the Jenkins developer list to see if:\n- There is a plugin, but it was not obvious that it could help you\n- Someone already has a ""private"" version of a plugin that they are using, that they may want to share now they know that someone else has a similar need\n- There are developers that want to help you write and/ or test your new plugin\n- If no plugins cover your needs, well, go ahead and happy coding!\nNB: Yes, this is some kind of decision matrix for plugin developers']"	['<urn:uuid:b98f1abe-852a-4015-8467-1f62917f32cf>', '<urn:uuid:9658d43c-9568-465a-91fb-97d79d8a37ab>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	13	56	2410
89	Which image format is better for high color photos - PNG or TGA?	TGA files support up to 32-bit color depth, but are not well suited for high-end pre-press and intensive image processing. PNG, while supporting 24-bit color with 16 million colors, is primarily used for web images rather than photography purposes. Neither format is optimal for high color photos - TGA is mainly used in animation/video industry for TV screens, while PNG files are typically larger in size compared to JPEG for photography.	"['This article needs additional citations for verification. (March 2014)\n.tga, .icb, .vda, .vst\n|Internet media type|\n|Uniform Type Identifier (UTI)||com.truevision.tga-image|\n|Type of format||Raster image file|\nTruevision TGA, often referred to as TARGA, is a raster graphics file format created by Truevision Inc. (now part of Avid Technology). It was the native format of TARGA and VISTA boards, which were the first graphic cards for IBM-compatible PCs to support Highcolor/truecolor display. This family of graphic cards was intended for professional computer image synthesis and video editing with PCs; for this reason, usual resolutions of TGA image files match those of the NTSC and PAL video formats.\nTARGA is an acronym for Truevision Advanced Raster Graphics Adapter; TGA is an initialism for Truevision Graphics Adapter.\nTGA files commonly have the extension "".tga"" on PC DOS/Windows systems and macOS (older Macintosh systems use the ""TPIC"" type code). The format can store image data with 8, 15, 16, 24, or 32 bits of precision per pixel – the maximum 24 bits of RGB and an extra 8-bit alpha channel. Color data can be color-mapped, or in direct color or truecolor format. Image data may be stored raw, or optionally, a lossless RLE compression similar to PackBits can be employed. This type of compression performs poorly for typical photographic images, but works acceptably well for simpler images, such as icons, cartoons and line drawings.\nThe TGA file format was originally defined and specified by AT&T EPICenter with feedback from Island Graphics Inc in 1984. AT&T EPICenter was an internal spin-off of AT&T created to market new technologies AT&T had developed for color frame buffers. What later became Truevision was the result of a leveraged employee buyout from AT&T in 1987.\nEPICenter\'s first two cards, the VDA (video display adapter) and ICB (image capture board), used the first incarnations of the TGA file format. The file extensions "".vda"" and "".icb"" implied information about the board specific data contained.\nIt was later determined by Alan Wlasuk (then head of EPICenter), Brad Pillow (EPICenter) and Steven Dompier (Island\'s president) that a more codified file format was needed. The file format was created and implemented by Brad Pillow (EPICenter) and Bryan Hunt (EPICenter) and was developed in response to this need for a less board specific file format. A very simple extension was made to what was already in use, and contained information on width, height, pixel depth, an associated color map and image origin. A label field (up to 255 characters) was also included in the initial spec, but was rarely used.\nAt the time, another technically superior file format called TIFF also appeared, but its use for true color images was very limited as the implementation and sharing of files between applications supporting the TIFF specification was rather difficult and involved. The TGA file format\'s simpler nature and portability between platforms is the main reason for its widespread adoption and its continued success in a wide variety of applications worldwide to this day.\nInitially the TGA file format was used in the ICB-PAINT and TARGA-PAINT programs (what later became known as TIPS) and for several projects in online real estate browsing and still-frame video teleconferencing.\nThe current version (2.0) includes several enhancements such as ""postage stamps"" (better known as thumbnails), an alpha channel, gamma value, and textual metadata, and was authored by Truevision Inc.\'s Shawn Steiner with direction from Kevin Friedly and David Spoelstra in 1989.\nAt the time of its launching, it represented the state of the art in digital image processing. Even today, though its maximum color depth is not well suited for high-end pre-press, intensive image processing systems, TGA is still used extensively throughout the animation and video industry because its primary intended outputs are standard TV screens, not color printed pages.\nUncompressed 24-bit TGA images are relatively simple compared to several other prominent 24-bit storage formats: A 24-bit TGA contains only an 18-byte header followed by the image data as packed RGB data. In contrast, BMP requires padding rows to 4-byte boundaries, while TIFF and PNG are metadata containers that do not place the image data or attributes at a fixed location within the file.\nThirty-two-bit TGA images contain an alpha channel, or key signal, and are often used in character generator programs such as Avid Deko.\nAll values are little-endian; field and subfield numbers are per Version 2.0 of the specification.\nVersion 2 added the extension area and footer. The developer area exists to store application-specific information.\n|Field no.||Length||Field name||Description|\n|1||1 byte||ID length||Length of the image ID field|\n|2||1 byte||Color map type||Whether a color map is included|\n|3||1 byte||Image type||Compression and color types|\n|4||5 bytes||Color map specification||Describes the color map|\n|5||10 bytes||Image specification||Image dimensions and format|\nImage ID length (field 1)\n0–255 The number of bytes that the image ID field consists of.

Some possible values are:\n- 0 no image data is present\n- 1 uncompressed color-mapped image\n- 2 uncompressed true-color image\n- 3 uncompressed black-and-white (grayscale) image\n- 9 run-length encoded color-mapped image\n- 10 run-length encoded true-color image\n- 11 run-length encoded black-and-white (grayscale) image\nImage type 1 and 9: Depending on the Pixel Depth value, image data representation is an 8, 15, or 16 bit index into a color map that defines the color of the pixel. Image type 2 and 10: The image data is a direct representation of the pixel color. For a Pixel Depth of 15 and 16 bit, each pixel is stored with 5 bits per color. If the pixel depth is 16 bits, the topmost bit is reserved for transparency. For a pixel depth of 24 bits, each pixel is stored with 8 bits per color. A 32-bit pixel depth defines an additional 8-bit alpha channel. Image type 3 and 11: The image data is a direct representation of grayscale data. The pixel depth is 8 bits for images of this type.\nColor map specification (field 4)\nhas three subfields:\n- First entry index (2 bytes): index of first color map entry that is included in the file\n- Color map length (2 bytes): number of entries of the color map that are included in the file\n- Color map entry size (1 byte): number of bits per pixel\nIn case that not the entire color map is actually used by the image, a non-zero first entry index allows to store only a required part of the color map in the file.\nImage specification (field 5)\nhas six subfields:\n- X-origin (2 bytes): absolute coordinate of lower-left corner for displays where origin is at the lower left\n- Y-origin (2 bytes): as for X-origin\n- Image width (2 bytes): width in pixels\n- Image height (2 bytes): height in pixels\n- Pixel depth (1 byte): bits per pixel\n- Image descriptor (1 byte): bits 3-0 give the alpha channel depth, bits 5-4 give direction\nImage and color map data\n|6||From image ID length field||Image ID||Optional field containing identifying information|\n|7||From color map specification field||Color map data||Look-up table containing color map data|\n|8||From image specification field||Image data||Stored according to the image descriptor|\nDeveloper area (optional)\nVersion 1.0 of the TGA specification was very basic, and many developers had a need to store more information, and so opted to add on extra sections to their files, specific to their application only.\nIn Version 2.0 of the specification, these application-specific enhancements/extras are supported by the developer area. Only the offset and size of the developer area are relevant to the spec, and developers are free to add whatever they want in the area.\nIf a TGA decoder cannot interpret the information in the developer area, it will generally ignore it, since it is assumed to have been created by a different application. It is recommended that developers build logic into their applications to determine whether the data in the developer area is compatible with the application; one step towards this is to check the software ID in the file footer.\nExtension area (optional)\n|10||2 bytes||Extension size||Size in bytes of the extension area, always 495|\n|11||41 bytes||Author name||Name of the author.

The packet may cross scan lines (begin on one line and end on the next)"".\nHowever, page 24 of the TGA v2.0 specification states the exact opposite: ""Run-length Packets should never encode pixels from more than one scan line.

Currently, PNG format is in high demand in the market as it gave a portable and well-compressed image file. Apart from PNG Full Form, we have provided other information related to PNG such as its meaning, History and Type of Digital Image Files etc on this page.\nPNG Full Form\nMeaning of PNG:\nPortable Network Graphics or PNG is a format that is used for compression of images in a lossless way. This file format is commonly used in web. PNG was developed after JPEG and GIF format, so it contains many features of both the formats. PNG supports 24-bit color and hence a PNG image has 16 million colors but GIF image contains a maximum of 256 colors.\nAlso Know Here: What Is The Full Form Of JPEG?\nHistory of the PNG Format:\nIn 1995, the working related to PNG has been started and also at that time GIF format was established. The main aim of creating the PNG format is to provide more enhance feature than Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) format.\n- 1 October 1996: Version 1.0 of PNG specification was released.\n- 31 December 1998: Version 1.1 was released with some small changes and three new chunks were added.\n- 11 August 1999: Version 1.2 was released with one extra chunk.\n- 10 November 2003: PNG became an International Standard (ISO/IEC 15948:2003).\n- 3 March 2004: ISO/IEC 15948:2004.\nKnow About: RADAR Full Form\nType of Digital Image Files:\nThere are mainly 5 types of Digital Image Files that helps in storing the image.\n1) TIFF (Tagged Image File Format):\nTIFF is also known as TIF and the extension of this file type is “.tif”. This type of file is most commonly used in photo softwares like photoshop. The images having tif extension are uncompressed and thus imager data is in detailed way and the files are big in size.\n2) JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group):\nJPEG is also known as JPG and the extension of this file type is “.jpg”. The image of JPEG file is compressed and thus it stores a large amount of data in small size file. The digital cameras are also storing the image with this extension as due to small size format, one can takes lots of photos in one camera card.\n3) GIF (Graphic Interchange Format):\nGIF images use the extension “.gif” which means the file type stored in this format ends up with “.gif”. Through this format, images are also compressed but image compression is different as compared to JPEG. In GIF, the image compression is lossless which means that the data doesn’t lost at the time of compression but file size is not as small as it is in JPEG format.\nGIF format is also used in animations but due to less number of colors, this file type is not used for photography purpose.\nRead Here: CRT Full Form\n4) PNG (Portable Network Graphics):\nPNG file types are ending with “.png” and it was created on behalf of replacement of GIF format. In comparison to GIF, PNG offers better compression and full range of colors. PNG is used in web images but it is not used for printing of images.\nWhile at the time of photography, PNG is also not good as compared to JPEG, as the file stored is larger in size. In images that contain text, we generally use PNG format as by using this, the image looks less ““bitmappy.”\n5) Raw image files:\nData contains in this type of file is usually from a digital camera. Raw files contain a large amount of data, and as a result, the files are extremely larger in size. The files are called raw because the data stored in it is generally not processed and is uncompressed. Before editing or color correction, the raw files are firstly converted into TIFF format.\nAdvantage of PNG:\n- The images that contains PNG format are of low-resolution, thus the image looks of good quality and is loaded quickly.\n- PNG supports variety of colors and is also a good format for editing of images.\n- At the time of compression, it doesn’t loss any data.\nGet Here: MRI Full Form\nUses of PNG Format:\n- For creating photos using drawings, illustrations, comics, etc\n- To scan texts like articles, letters, newspapers, etc\n- For creating charts, graphs, logos etc\nFrom this page of recruitmentresult.com, candidates will be able to get complete information about PNG such as PNG Full Form, its meaning, history, advantages and uses.\nSomething That You Should Put an Eye On\n|MIS Full Form||Full Form of CPC|\n|NAAC Full Form||TCP/IP Full Form|\n|BCC Full Form||OECD Full Form|\n|VPN Full Form||USSD Full Form|']"	['<urn:uuid:c26728f7-d20f-477b-b1ac-84193b941645>', '<urn:uuid:7024e0dc-4ead-4c05-9c27-60fb838111ff>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	13	71	2704
90	big waves on planet Mars how tall how fast they moved want to learn more	On Mars, massive tsunami waves could reach up to 120 metres in height when they reached the shore, and they moved at speeds of up to 20 metres per second as they rushed outward from impact sites. These waves were triggered by giant meteoroids striking an ancient ocean in Mars's northern hemisphere approximately 3.4 billion years ago.	['Some 3.4 billion years ago, giant meteoroids slammed into a frigid ocean covering Mars’s northern hemisphere. The impacts kicked up enormous waves that raced across the water and swamped the shoreline, research suggests.\nOn the scale of planetary catastrophes, such tsunamis would have dwarfed most Earthly ones. “Imagine this enormous red wave coming towards you, up to 120 metres high,” says Alexis Rodriguez, a Mars researcher at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona. “It would have been pretty spectacular.”\nRodriguez and his colleagues mapped traces of two of these tsunamis. They describe the findings in Scientific Reports.\nIf the idea stands up to further scrutiny, it may help resolve longstanding arguments about whether Mars had an ancient northern ocean. As evidence, some scientists point to what they call the remains of a shoreline, like a bathtub ring left behind when the water drained away. But the purported shoreline isn’t visible everywhere that it should be.\nMega-tsunamis could have wiped away some of that shoreline, happening as often as every 3 million years or so, Rodriguez says.\nResearchers have previously suggested tsunamis on Mars. A 2010 study calculated that high-energy waves should have left an imprint on the proposed Martian shoreline. A 2014 paper simulated how fast and how tall such waves might have moved — up to 20 metres a second as they rushed outward from the impact site, and up to 120 metres high when they reached the shore.\nRodriguez began thinking about Martian tsunamis after visiting the eastern coast of Japan in 2011, which had been devastated by a tsunami generated by a magnitude-9 earthquake. His team grew to include some top Martian geology experts.\nThe group zeroed in on a region on Mars where the highlands known as Arabia Terra bump up against the lowlands of Chryse Planitia — a place where the waters of an ancient ocean might have lapped at the shoreline. Using imagery from several Mars-orbiting spacecraft, Rodriguez’s group identified two particular geological formations that they say formed during two different tsunamis.\nThe first, older formation looks as if an enormous wave had rushed up onto the edge of the highlands, dropping boulders as big as 10 metres across. The water then drained back down into the ocean, leaving channels cut through the freshly deposited debris.\nThen, millions of years passed. Temperatures dropped and glaciers crept across the landscape, scouring deep valleys. Finally, a second impact-generated tsunami came rushing again towards the shore. “But this time it is different,” Rodriguez says.\nBecause the climate was so much colder, the tsunami moved over the landscape like an icy slurry. It froze before it had a chance to wash back into the ocean, leaving dense lobes of frozen debris on the ground.\nThe new study is consistent with earlier ideas about how these Martian features formed, says Timothy Parker, a planetary scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, who originally came up with the idea of a northern Martian ocean. In previous work he described the backwash channels as forming when big waves washed up on a beach and drained back down again. “Though I didn’t specifically talk about tsunamis in my interpretations, the implication of scale was certainly there,” he says.\nThe icy-looking lobes are particularly exciting, says James Dohm, a planetary scientist at the University Museum of the University of Tokyo. Even as the ocean eventually froze out and died, the tsunami deposits remained untouched by wind or other types of erosion for more than 3 billion years. (Dohm adds that he would have liked to have witnessed the Mars tsunamis, preferably from a high ridge and without an astronaut helmet blocking his vision.)\nRodriguez is now looking for evidence of tsunamis in other parts of Mars, as well as analogues on Earth that could help him to understand them better. One area of interest is a group of small craters near the shoreline that could have been drenched by the tsunami, and then trapped that water for millions of years. Such isolated pockets of water could have been places for Martian life to evolve, if it ever existed, Rodriguez says.\nThis summer, he hopes to travel to Tibet to study high, cold mountain lakes that may give him a glimpse into those long-ago Martian craters.']	['<urn:uuid:b75da764-2b0a-4988-89a2-6031226c1852>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	15	57	715
91	I'm trying to stay healthy and hydrated during my workouts. What's the connection between fiber intake and proper hydration, and how can I make sure I'm getting both right?	Fiber and hydration work together for optimal health. There are two types of fiber: soluble fiber, which dissolves in water and helps lower cholesterol levels, and insoluble fiber, which absorbs water like a sponge and helps prevent constipation. For hydration after exercise, you need to consume 125-150% of estimated fluid lost over a 4-6 hour period. It's important to include 50-80mmol of sodium with your fluids to help retain water and replace electrolytes lost through sweating. Both types of fiber can be found in fruits and vegetables, which can be part of your post-workout nutrition plan. Good sources of soluble fiber include oatmeal, apples, and kidney beans, while insoluble fiber can be found in wheat bran, lentils, and flex seeds.	"['Dietary carbohydrates include foods that are rich in starch or sugar (or both). The chemical name for starch is polysaccharide (“poly” meaning many and “saccharide” meaning sugars). The many sugars that make up starch are linked by chemical bonds that are broken down by the body during the process of digestion. Starches are classified as complex carbohydrates and these can be part of a heart healthy diet.\nOne major sub-category of carbohydrates is simple carbohydrates, otherwise known as simple sugars. Simple sugars are one- or two-unit sugars (mono- or disaccharides) that are more quickly and easily digested and absorbed by the body. While this may sound like a good thing at first, eating too many simple sugars can have serious negative consequences for our health. We need to limit the amount of sugar in our diets to improve our heart health and prevent heart disease.\nThe simplest and most common of the simple sugars is glucose, a single-unit sugar that our bodies can break down to make energy or convert into body energy stores, including fat. A close relative of this sugar is fructose, the kind of sugar found in fruits, as well as many other foods. When glucose and fructose are linked together, they form the disaccharide called sucrose (another simple sugar), which is also known as table sugar. There are generally far too many simple sugars in the Western diet - which is gradually becoming the Global diet, as processed food becomes increasingly available around the world.\nThe pitfalls of a high-sugar diet\nHigh-sugar diets have been linked to excess weight gain and an increased risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes, certain types of cancer and heart disease. Interestingly, when we reduce the sugar in our diets over a longer period of time, our taste buds become more sensitized to smaller amounts of sugar in our food. So, by eating less sugar, we actually end up needing less sugar to satisfy that sweet tooth! But beware: artificial sweeteners should also be avoided. Calorie-free artificial sweeteners, like those found in diet sodas, are so sweet that they tend to desensitize our taste buds, meaning that we may end up craving (and needing) more sugar to get the same sensation of sweet! But not all sugars are bad for us.\nNaturally occurring sugars\nNaturally occurring sugars (like those found in fruits and milk products) are generally much healthier for us because they’re complexed or bound together with other good nutrients, like fiber (in the case of fruit), protein and calcium (in the case of milk). Lactose is the disaccharide found in milk and dairy products. These foods can be an important part of a healthy diet when eaten in the right amounts…but remember: everything in moderation! Full fat dairy products are still rich in saturated fats, which can contribute to elevated cholesterol levels if eaten in excess. Take the middle road – if you like dairy, choose moderate amounts of low fat dairy products, like low fat milk, yoghurts, cottage cheese and other cheeses. Especially during periods of rapid growth like pregnancy or the teenage years, these nutrients can be an important part of a healthy diet.\nUnlike the one- or two-unit sugars (simple carbohydrates), complex carbohydrates are made up of many glucose molecules linked together by chemical bonds. Starchy foods, including potatoes, bread, pasta, and rice are high in complex carbohydrates, but the degree to which these are “heart healthy” depends - mostly on how much fiber they contain.\nHow can fiber help to reduce cholesterol levels and protect heart health?\nDietary fiber is also a form of complex carbohydrate. The major difference is that dietary fiber contains little or no calories because our bodies cannot break down the bonds between the single sugar units in this kind of complex carbohydrate. Additionally, there are two subtypes of dietary fiber: 1) soluble fiber and 2) insoluble fiber.\nWhat is soluble fiber and how can it support health?\nSoluble fiber dissolves in water and can play an important part in lowering cholesterol levels because it inhibits the absorption of cholesterol back into the bloodstream. Soluble fiber can be found in foods like unprocessed oatmeal, oat bran, apples, prunes and some legumes, like kidney beans.\nWhat is insoluble fiber and how can it support health?\nInsoluble fiber absorbs water (like a sponge) and acts as a stool softener, speeding up the passage of food through the intestinal tract. This prevents constipation, a common problem in those who eat a diet that is high in refined (low-fiber) carbohydrates. Insoluble fiber is found in foods like wheat bran, lentils and flex seeds. Both types of fiber are found in fruits and vegetables.\nWhat are the best carbohydrates for heart health?\nIn order to eat a heart healthy diet, the carbohydrates we choose should ideally be unrefined, to support intestinal health and maximize nutrient density. This means choosing whole-grain breads over white breads and brown rice over white rice whenever possible. Unrefined carbohydrates take longer to digest so they also sustain satiety, delaying the return of hunger and helping to stabilize blood sugar levels. All of these factors can lead to better general health - and a healthier heart.\nBy Maya Adam, MD, Adapted from Food, Love, Family, A Practical Guide to Child Nutrition', 'Eating to Recover: How and What to Eat Post Workout\nFor years the most important meal of the day has been said to be breakfast, but I believe that to be wrong. I suspect most of the readers here could agree that with all the effort you put into your training that your post-workout nutrition just may be more important to you than breakfast. In fact, I believe your post-workout meal is one of the most important meals you can have all day.\nThe reason I believe this is because in a hard workout, you can use up all your stored glycogen, easily sweat over two liters of water, and break down both muscle and red blood cells. This is why what you as an athlete consume in the minutes and hours after your training or competition is so crucial to both performance and recovery. This week I will look at nutrition recovery and explain it\'s importance and the best ways to use it to maximize your results.\nRecovery is defined in the Webster dictionary as ""the act of regaining or returning toward a normal or healthy state."" In recovery nutrition the foods we choose to consume have been shown to positively affect recovery and an athlete\'s future performance.\nThe Goals and Timeframe of Post Exercise Nutrition\n“Recovery” covers a range of processes that include:\n- Replenishing the muscle and liver glycogen stores\n- Consuming protein to assist with muscle repair\n- Restoring fluid and electrolytes lost in sweat\n- Supporting the immune system to handle the damage\nIt has been determined that the body\'s cells are most receptive to replenishment, particularly glycogen stores, within the first thirty minutes after intense training. Essentially the clock starts ticking for an athlete as soon as they enter their cool down. This is just one part of the equation as recovery nutrition can be broken into two stages - stage one occurs within thirty minutes of the workout and stage two occurs one to two hours after exercise.\nReplenishing the Body\'s Glycogen Stores\nIngesting carbohydrates after training is critical in replenishing glycogen stores and initiating muscle glycogen synthesis. If we don\'t replenish these stores an athlete\'s training performance can be compromised in future sessions.\nIt is recommended that 1.2g per kilogram of bodyweight of carbohydrates be consumed post exercise. Sometimes it is not practical for an athlete to consume such a large quantity of carbohydrates straight after exercise, as they may have difficulties tolerating food or drink. There is a way to combat this, though. Research in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism has shown that ingesting protein (0.2-0.4g/kg) and a smaller amount of carbohydrates together (around 0.8g/kg) can result in a similar effect, stimulating an endogenous insulin release that actually replenishes glycogen stores at a similar rate as ingesting 1.2g/kg of bodyweight of carbohydrates does.\nBuilding and Repairing Muscle\nMuscle protein is broken down due to high intensity or prolonged exercise. This makes recovery nutrition important in helping to rebuild. Once the recovery phase begins the catabolic processes reduce while anabolic processes increase and continue on for at least 24 hours after training. The ingestion of essential amino acids from quality protein sources has been shown to help with the muscle-building process. Even though research continues into the type, amount, and timing of protein consumption to obtain the maximum results, most agree that athletes who do either endurance or resistance type training will get the desired benefit by consuming 20-30g of high quality protein within the first hour post exercise.\nRehydrating the Body\nMost athletes will finish a competition or training session in some kind of fluid deficit. If this deficit is not corrected it can have a significant impact on future training sessions. In order to rectify this deficit an athlete should aim to consume 125-150% of the estimated fluid lost over a four to six hour period post exercise.\nIncluding sodium into recovery fluid can assist in replacing the electrolytes lost through excessive sweating. Rather than just losing the fluid through excessive urination, the addition of electrolytes can help the body retain the water consumed. In order to rehydrate effectively, 50-80mmol of sodium should be added. This can be achieved by adding extra electrolytes to commercial sports drinks or consuming fluids created with this ratio. Another alternative is consuming foods that contain sodium along with recovery fluids to achieve this required amount.\nSupporting the Immune System\nIntensive training can suppress the immune system. This suppression occurs while training is in progress and can continue to affect the efficiency of the immune system for hours afterward. This is obviously a concern for athletes as these hours of decreased immune function could allow an athlete to pick up an infection. Vitamins C and E, zinc, glutamine, and probiotics have all been touted to aid in the protection and support of the immune system. None have been proven to provide a bulletproof defense. There has been research, though, stating that if adequate glycogen stores are maintained pre and post exercise that this can reduce the disturbance of immune system markers as the consumption of carbohydrates can help reduce the bodies stress hormone response to exercise.\nUsing Supplements or Whole Foods to Meet Your Goals\nThese days there is a supplement for everything and for some athletes this means that they can get lazy and become totally reliant on sports supplements to meet their recovery goals. Unfortunately this can mean that some athletes end up doubling up on specific nutrients. While inherently this not a bad thing, some minerals taken in excess can cause toxic symptoms, so an athlete needs to be aware of what is in his or her supplements.\nAthletes are generally advised to obtain real food options to aid in recovery unless constrained for time. This is because it also allows an athlete to meet the daily nutritional needs of essential vitamins and minerals, and also stock up on much needed antioxidants like vitamins C and E that help reduce oxidization caused from the stress of exercise.\nPractical considerations of recovery nutrition also need to be taken into account. Issues like a lack of appetite, unavailability of food, and being unprepared can all play a part in an athlete failing to meet recovery goals. With a little planning these challenges can be nothing more than bumps in the road. Once an athlete notices the benefits, these bumps should be even further minimized, making for a consistent and competitive athlete through something as simple as eating the right foods at the right time.\n1.

92	How much drinking water should I store for emergencies?	You should store at least one gallon per person per day for drinking purposes.	['As the high winds and pelting rain of Hurricane Sandy bear down on much of the East Coast, people are getting ready for the worst. They’ve packed away things like batteries and matches, and—because they might be greatly limited in how far they can get for a few days—food and water. But even a natural disaster like a hurricane should be no impediment to eating a healthy diet.\nIt may seem ironic, with tons of water falling from the sky and water levels rising from below, but the most important thing you’ll need is fresh, clean water. The water you’ll find around you from rain and flooding will probably be contaminated and dangerous to be near, let alone drink. Flood water is especially dangerous, as much of it may have come in contact with sewage. Never taste a food to see if it’s “still good.” If you even suspect food has come into contact with flood water, discard it immediately. The same goes for food-related items, such as cutting boards, plastic cutlery, and baby bottle nipples. It’s best to put away at least one gallon per person per day for drinking, and to fill bathtubs and sinks before the storm to have a supply of water for bathing and other non-drinking uses.\nWhen it comes to stocking food for when you’re waiting out a hurricane, the key is the packaging. This, too, will seem counter-intuitive for people who want to eat a healthy diet, as most of us are strong believers that packaged, prepared foods are nutritional disasters, full of sodium, fats, and synthetic chemicals. While healthy (or at least not harmful) packaged foods may not be common, they do exist. In order to get the healthiest options, consumers should look for foods that are low in calories—120 should be the limit for a snack—sodium, sugar, and fat. Steer clear of any packaged food with trans fats, and look instead for fiber and, if you can get it, essential fatty acids like omega-3.\nWhile there are health-related issues with food that comes in cans lined with coatings containing the chemical bisphenol A (BPA), there are plenty of BPA-free canned goods if you look for them. And canned foods can provide excellent nutrition in times of emergency. At the top of the list are canned beans, which are rich in both fiber and protein. Be sure, however, to drain canned beans completely, and—if you have enough clean water—rinse them thoroughly. Many brands of canned beans are packed in brine that’s full of sodium; washing off as much of it as you can makes the beans themselves all that much healthier for you.\nOne canned food that may even be better for you than beans is tuna, particularly albacore or “white” tuna. Though relatively low in calories, albacore tuna is jam-packed with protein, and is an excellent source of omega-3fatty acid. It’s also very rich in vitamin D, an essential building block that helps protect the immune system, and selenium, a mineral that helps prevent cancer and cardiovascular disease. As an added bonus, albacore is also an excellent source of vitamin B12 and phosphorus, which, when combined, help synthesize proteins and aid in kidney and liver function. The only catch with tuna is that, as a large predatory fish, it can be exposed to mercury. Because of this, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that pregnant women eat no more than six ounces of albacore tuna per week.\nCanned soup can also be an excellent option, although canned soup is no match for fresh-made soup when it comes to nutrition, and many popular varieties are loaded with sodium, monosodium glutamate (MSG), and other items you probably don’t want to consume. It always pays to look at any packaged product’s list of ingredients and nutritional data, but that’s especially true of soup, which can be made of nearly any type of food. Look for soups that are made from the same types of food you would eat otherwise, like fish and seafood, green leafy vegetables, and other nutritious items.\nIf you can keep it cool, yogurt is an excellent food to have on hand when disaster strikes. Besides being low in calories, rich in protein, and an excellent source of calcium and B-vitamins, yogurt can decrease the frequency and severity of yeast and intestinal infections and help stimulate the immune system, and can be easier to digest than milk. Be sure to look for Greek-style yogurt, which is lower in fat and calories than other varieties, and to avoid flavorings, which are often high in sugar and low in any of the nutrition one associates with fruit or chocolate. If you don’t have access to a working refrigeration unit, packaged milk (also known as shelf-stable milk) is a reasonable, if not perfect, alternative for your dairy needs.\nFor snacks, the best option can be prepackaged granola bars, which can provide solid nutrition and quick energy if you are careful about which ones you choose. But, as with soups, it’s essential to completely read the label. In an effort to lower manufacturing costs and to appeal to a broader audience, many granola bar makers have added massive amounts of sugar and other harmful ingredients to their products. Look for bars that have fewer than 120 calories, no trans fats, less than two grams of saturated fat, and at least six grams of protein and two grams of fiber. To get the best, you may have to shop in a health-food store. Make sure your granola bars are high in oats, one of the best grains for optimal health. If you can, buy granola bars (or other products like bread) that contain flaxseeds, which are rich in omega-3, fiber, and antioxidants. Of course, the basic ingredients of granola bars—whole grains, nuts, and fruit—are all nutritious options by themselves, but beware of sodium, sugar, and other adulterants when buying them prepackaged.\nAnother source of nutrition and flavor can come from frozen fruits and vegetables. Freezing food makes it lose far less of its nutritional value than with other packaging methods, and can add much-needed taste to the basic foods you may have on hand in an emergency. Be sure to use the entire package, though, as food can’t be safely refrozen.\nWhile the weather may prevent you from getting outside, it should not prevent you from eating right.']	['<urn:uuid:6b6ba400-d287-4994-bebc-72511f18e0ec>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	9	14	1064

Here are tips for handling some of the most difficult road hazards.\nGet through heavy rain, fog, wildfires, smoke, and any other situation that lowers visibility.\n- Drive with lights on low beam (some states require headlights in rain, and daytime running lights don’t count.)\n- Open your window to listen for traffic you can’t see.\n- Switching on defrost (without heat and/or open window to speed up window defog.)\n- Reduce distractions; turn off radio and cell phone.\n- Use the right edge of the road or road markers as a guide.\n- Drive cautiously: slow down (high speeds and/or worn tires can result in hydroplaning,) signal turns well in advance, brake early.\n- Do not stop on busy road. Signal, pull off as far as possible, and turn on hazard lights.\nWhat to Do When Lightening Strikes\n- An enclosed metal vehicle–with all doors closed and windows rolled up–is relatively safe, but NOT any open or soft top vehicle.\n- Pull off the road as a lightening flash can cause temporary blindness.\nBe Wary of Floods\n- Avoid driving through water, as little as six inches can cause you to lose control while two feet will carry away most cars.\n- Don’t drive through standing water if you see fallen power lines or electric wires nearby.\n- If a power line or electric wire falls on your car, drive away from the wire. But don’t turn off ignition, even if the engine stalls. Stay in your car and wait for emergency workers. Don’t let anyone other than emergency workers near your vehicle.\nSurvive Being Stuck in a Car in Snow\nIn addition to the all-purpose emergency roadside kit, a few extra items may be useful in winter:\n- Ice scraper and snow brush\n- Tire chains (where allowed or required)\n- Rock salt, kitty litter, or sand (for extra traction)\n- Wear warm clothing and boots (pack a change of clothing, including extra winter coat, mittens, and cap.)\n- Colander to strain snow, car-kettle to warm it, and large bowl to collect warmed water. Don’t drink cold water or snow!\n- Chemical hand and body warmer packets\nIf stuck in snow:\n- Conserve gas, but keep car warm by turning on engine every 15-20 minutes.\n- Make sure tail pipe is clear to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.\n- Stay warm by wrapping up in extra clothes and blankets and moving often.\n- Hydrate with warmed water (your body can’t afford to lose heat on cold water or snow.)\n- Extreme cold can reduce cellphone battery life, keep cellphone close to body and limit use to stay connected.\nGoing into the Desert\nIncrease your drinking water supplies if heading into desert or extreme heat conditions. Plan to have 2-3 liters of water per person, per day. 2-gallon water jugs with spigots are handy, as are refillable dromedaries. And one or more windshield sun shades can help keep parked cars coolers. Regardless, NEVER leave pets or children unattended.\nKeep in mind that cell reception in deserts is spotty at best. Gas stations are few and far between, so top off fuel tanks when you can.\nDon’t Try to Outrun a Tornado!\nIf you see signs of an approaching storm or you get a tornado alert, stop your vehicle. Don’t try to outrun a tornado and don’t park or hide under an overpass (winds are faster there.) Motor vehicles are easily tossed by high winds, so it’s best to abandon it–unless the roadway is the lowest ground you can get to. If that’s the case, buckle up, lower your head below the windows, and cover up with a blanket if available.\nIf you can safely get below road level, leave your vehicle and lie low, protecting your head as best as possible.\nBrake for Earthquakes\nIf you feel an earthquake or you get an alert, stop the car as quickly and safely as possible. Park away from utility poles, overhead wires, and under- or overpasses. Set the parking brake and stay in the car, monitoring the radio or cellphone for emergency broadcasts. If a power line falls on the car, remain in the vehicle until a trained person removes the wire.', 'What To Keep In Your Car In Case Of Emergency\nWe spend a lot of time in our car, but are we prepared for anything that might happen? What if it breaks down in the middle of nowhere? What if it’s the dead of winter in the middle of the night? What if there’s an accident? What if someone in the car gets sick? Are we prepared for any of those situations? We can and should be.\nUsually, a sudden malfunction can leave you miles away from help. Worse, you might find yourself with no phone signal!\nAlthough unforeseen circumstances can’t be predicted, you can have the right items in your arsenal to hopefully prepare you for anything.\nWhether you’re driving a minivan, truck or hatchback, it’s always a good idea to keep these things in your car in case something unforeseen happens.\nCellphone And Cellphone Charger\nBelieve it or not, a cellphone and a cellphone charger is one of the most valuable devices to have these days in your car and on your person. A lot of people have no experience changing a tire and calling someone to help would be a top priority.\nYou never want to be caught with a dad phone battery, especially in a dire emergency in a car in the middle of nowhere. So make sure you either have a car charger or better yet a portable battery (in case the car charger doesn’t work) to charge your phone and make a call during an emergency.\nFirst Aid Kit\nYou should always have a first aid kit with you in the car. It’s something we don’t often think of carrying with us, but it can be one of the most important things you can have with you in case of an emergency.\nThis kit should be complete with bandages, vinyl gloves, scissors, antiseptic, pain relief medicine, band aids, and q-tips that will come in handy for a lot of things.\n- 200-PIECE FIRST AID: Keep your family safe indoors & outdoors with premium First Aid supplies\n- COMPACT, LIGHT AND PORTABLE: Rugged kit fits into backpack or car glovebox, weighs only 16 oz.\n- ★UPGRADED GEAR FOR 2020: Includes Fire Starter Rod, Compass, Wire Saw, Fishing Line, & Mylar Blanket\n- ALL PURPOSE: Recommended for home, car, boat, camping, kitchen, sports and weather emergencies\n- FDA REGISTERED & TRUSTED: Swiss Safe Guarantees customer satisfaction or receive a 100% refund.\n- Manufactured by the #1 leading manufacturer of First Aid Kits in the USA. 100 pieces of comprehensive first aid treatment products.\n- This Kit meets United States FDA Regulatory Standards as a Medical Device.

The rugged, sturdy, high density plastic case is impact resistant\n- Compact size case measures 7.5in x 2.5in x 6.8in, is portable and can easily fit anywhere.\n- Features Easy Slide Latches that securely locks into place.\nTire Changing Supplies\nNo one wants to be stuck in the road with broken tires. To avoid this, have your tire changing supplies ready at the back of your car.\nBe ready with your tire iron, spare tire, tire jack, lug wrench, handy dandy Fix-A-Flat, and even some WD-40 on hand so you’ve got everything you need if a tire suddenly goes flat.\nDead batteries happen. It can take you by surprise. But don’t rely on a Good Samaritan to always show up and give you a jump.\nHave a set of jumper cables ready in your own car. Be sure to carefully follow the instructions to safely return the power back to your vehicle.\nDuct tape is great for everything, from roadside first aid to temporary repairs.\nThis roll of tape is a quick and easy repair to get you back on the road if you have a minor hose leak. This could give you just what you need to make it home or to a repair shop and not leave you stranded needing a tow.\nHave a basic tool kit containing pliers, hammer, screwdriver, and wrench within reach all the time.\nAs a lot of roads are not well lit, there are also others with no lighting at all!\nIf you need to pull over, especially in the middle of the night, you need to stand out against the dark, especially for late-night motorists.\nA blanket will not only keep you warm during winter, if you break down, it will also keep you and your tools clean in case you need to look under your car or change the tire.\nYou need a flashlight when changing a tire at night. It can also illuminate your work space and allow other motorists to easily spot you from a distance.\nMake sure to keep a few things you can snack on in case you get really stuck. There’s nothing worse than adding hunger to an already frustrating situation.\nKeep a few non-perishable food items in your car. Stash some granola bars, dried fruit packs, or energy bars in case of emergency.\nThese food items can be eaten without utensils and you won’t need water to wash your hands afterward.\nPaper towels are quick cleanup options.\nYou can use them to wipe the dirt off your face and hands. You can also wipe the bugs off the windshield or clean your seat using a paper towel.\nAlso having toilet paper handy is useful especially when traveling and having to use some not great gas station bathrooms along the way…\nNobody wants to be stuck feeling helpless on the road. However, if you have these items with you, in your car, you’re assured that you have a solution in case something happens while you’re driving.\nAre there other things that you keep in your car for emergency purposes?

94	What health risks exist in seasonal vs. year-round food products?	Seasonal products like the winter matanza sausages in Ibiza provide food for the entire year through traditional preservation methods, while year-round products like raw milk carry consistent health dangers, especially for vulnerable groups like pregnant women, children, elderly and immunocompromised people, potentially causing severe illnesses from vomiting to life-threatening conditions requiring hospitalization.	['12 Nov It’s ‘matanza’ time in Ibiza\nFrom late November to mid-December, many Ibicenco families celebrate in their country houses one of the most anticipated culinary events of the year: the day of matanzas (the slaughtering of farm raised pig). On the island there is a long tradition of pig breeding and this is the season when the animals are sacrificed in order to lay in food and make traditional homemade cold meats and sausages, such as sobrasadas. The resulting meats from this celebration will fill up the household’s pantry for the entire year. It is one of the most important moments of the winter, equal in importance to Christmas and the local patron saint’s day.\nThe day of the matanza is a day of very hard work, but it is also enjoyed immensely, as the whole family gets together to enjoy a gastronomic feast which takes place in several stages. Early on, the men start the butchering process, as well as the elaboration of traditional sausages: sobrasada and butifarra.\nIn every family there is an expert slaughterer but if not, they bring in someone from the neighborhood. He is the one who sets the guidelines throughout the whole process, but the owner also makes decisions such as what parts of the animal will be used for making the sobrasada and butifarra and what meat will remain intact. The remaining fat and bones are salted and later used for flavoring stews and broths.\nTo prepare the sobrasada and other typical sausages and cold meats, the lean pork is minced with some pork fat and then mixed with various spices such as pepper, paprika, cloves, nutmeg and even cayenne pepper for spicy varieties. The sobrasadas are left to hang raw in a drying place in the pantry, while the butifarras, which also include the animal’s blood, are boiled in a cauldron. These typical Ibicenco sausages are held together by the animal’s intestines, which have been washed thoroughly with boiling water, orange and lemon.\nWhile the butchering is going on, others prepare food. Around mid-morning, a hearty breakfast is served. This includes pickled fish, the previous year’s cold meats, fried squid, sobrasada and butifarra, fried bacon, cheese, freshly baked ‘pan payés’ (country bread) and, of course, sweet fritters and fruit in abundance. The menu varies in each household.\nThe main meal, is celebrated after the cutting has finished and all the utensils for the butchering have been collected. However, if the food is still not ready, some people take the opportunity to go for a walk in the woods and collect saffron milk caps (a type of wild mushroom). The dinner, nonetheless, is usually the same in every household: ‘Arroz de matanzas’, a thick soupy rice, made with fresh pork and free range chicken, saffron milk caps and, in some homes, even with fried squid and fish stock. A spectacular surf and turf winter dish.\nThe second course is the ‘frita de matanzas’ (literally, fried slaughter): ribs, offal, pork loin and other parts of the pig, all fried in tallow with peppers. Some people accompany it with a finely chopped cabbage salad, to lighten the meal. The feast concludes with delicious sugary sweet fritters. To remember such a special day you just have to cut open a sobrasada.', 'The Dangers of Drinking Raw Milk\nWhat is raw milk?\nRaw milk is milk from cows, sheep or goats that has not been pasteurized to kill harmful bacteria.\nWhat does the New York State Department of Health recommend about the consumption of raw milk or raw milk products?\nThe New York State Department of Health strongly recommends that people DO NOT CONSUME any raw milk or raw milk products. The New York State Department of Health recommends consuming only milk and milk products that have been pasteurized.\nWhat are the recommendations from other agencies about consuming raw milk or raw milk products?\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical, veterinary and scientific organizations recommend consuming only pasteurized milk and milk products.\nWhat is pasteurization?\nPasteurization is the process of heating milk to a high enough temperature for a long enough time to kill disease-causing bacteria contained in the milk and has been used safely for over 100 years. Pasteurization of milk became widespread in the United States by 1950. Pasteurization is the only way to ensure that milk products do not contain harmful bacteria.\nDo products made from raw milk carry dangerous bacteria?\nYes. Other foods made with raw milk include soft cheeses, sour cream, yogurt and ice cream. Any food made with raw milk can contain dangerous bacteria and consuming these foods can make you very sick.\nWhat kinds of harmful bacteria can raw milk contain?\nCan these bacteria be especially dangerous to certain people?\nYes. The bacteria in raw milk can seriously affect the health of anyone who drinks raw milk or eats foods made from raw milk. The bacteria can be especially dangerous to pregnant women, children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems.\nWhat symptoms can people have if they become ill from drinking raw milk with these bacteria?\nMost commonly, bacteria in raw milk can cause vomiting, diarrhea (sometimes bloody), abdominal pain, fever, headache and body aches. In some instances, people can develop pneumonia, blood-stream infections, kidney failure, inflammation of the nervous system (meningitis), chronic liver disease or chronic heart disease from drinking raw milk. While some people will have mild illness from bacteria in raw milk, others are at much higher risk of life-threatening illness, especially pregnant women, children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems (such as people with cancer or HIV infection or recipients of organ transplants).\nHow many people in the United States have become ill from consuming raw milk or raw milk products?\nSince 1993, over 70 outbreaks of human illness from consumption of raw milk have been reported nationwide, affecting over 1,500 people and causing 185 hospitalizations and 2 deaths. The actual number of illnesses associated with raw milk likely is far greater.\nWhat should I do if I become ill after drinking raw milk or eating a product made with raw milk?\nIf you or someone you know becomes ill after consuming raw milk or products made from raw milk, see a doctor or health care provider immediately, especially if you are pregnant or at higher risk for developing severe illness.\nDoes pasteurizing milk reduce its nutritional value?\nNo. The pasteurization process does not change the nutritional value of milk.\nDoes pasteurization cause disease, developmental problems or behavioral problems?\nNo. Pasteurization has never been shown to cause disease or other health problems.\nDoes pasteurization cause lactose intolerance or allergic reactions?\nNo. Pasteurization has never been shown to contribute to lactose intolerance or other allergic health problems.\nHow does New York State regulate the sale of raw milk?\nIn New York State, raw milk may only be sold at dairy farms that hold a permit from the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. Permitted farms are required to maintain proper sanitation, animal health, packaging procedures, monthly inspections, routine sampling and testing and post signs that warn that raw milk does not provide the protection of pasteurization.\nWhere can I see a complete copy of the rules and regulations regarding raw milk sales in New York?\nRequirements for the Production, Processing, Manufacturing and Distribution of Milk and Milk Products: www.agriculture.ny.gov/DI/Laws%20in%20PDF/PART2_milk_control_law.pdf.\nWhere can I get additional information about the risks of consuming raw milk?\nVisit the following resources:\n- The Dangers of Raw Milk: Unpasteurized Milk Can Pose a Serious Health Risk - U.S. FDA\n- Raw Milk Fact Sheet - FDA & CDC\n- Health Benefits, Risks, and Regulations of Raw and Pasteurized Milk, Valente B.

95	I've been hearing about water pollution in the news lately and want to help fix this problem - what are the main things causing water pollution nowadays and what can regular people do about it?	Water pollution today comes from multiple sources. Major causes include industrial waste containing toxic chemicals, untreated sewage from households (including cleaning products, personal care items), agricultural fertilizers and pesticides that wash into water bodies, plastic waste, oil spills, and even microfibers shed from clothes and carpets (which can release up to 700,000 fibers per washing machine cycle). Studies show these issues are widespread - for example, 83% of tap water samples globally contain plastic contamination. To help address these problems, individuals can take several actions: use environmentally friendly household cleaners instead of harmful chemicals, properly dispose of medicines and insecticides (not in sinks or toilets), use manure instead of chemical fertilizers, recycle waste properly rather than dumping it near waterways, carry reusable shopping bags to reduce plastic waste, and minimize the use of products that contain microplastics. Additionally, promoting awareness about protecting waterways in your community can help motivate others to take action.	['Microplastic contamination has been found in tap water in countries around the world, leading to calls from scientists for urgent research on the implications for health.\nScores of tap water samples from more than a dozen nations were analysed by scientists for an investigation by Orb Media, who shared the findings with the Guardian. Overall, 83% of the samples were contaminated with plastic fibres.\nThe US had the highest contamination rate, at 94%, with plastic fibres found in tap water sampled at sites including Congress buildings, the US Environmental Protection Agency’s headquarters, and Trump Tower in New York. Lebanon and India had the next highest rates.\nEuropean nations including the UK, Germany and France had the lowest contamination rate, but this was still 72%. The average number of fibres found in each 500ml sample ranged from 4.8 in the US to 1.9 in Europe.\nThe new analyses indicate the ubiquitous extent of microplastic contamination in the global environment. Previous work has been largely focused on plastic pollution in the oceans, which suggests people are eating microplastics via contaminated seafood.\n“We have enough data from looking at wildlife, and the impacts that it’s having on wildlife, to be concerned,” said Dr Sherri Mason, a microplastic expert at the State University of New York in Fredonia, who supervised the analyses for Orb. “If it’s impacting [wildlife], then how do we think that it’s not going to somehow impact us?”\nA separate small study in the Republic of Ireland released in June also found microplastic contamination in a handful of tap water and well samples. “We don’t know what the [health] impact is and for that reason we should follow the precautionary principle and put enough effort into it now, immediately, so we can find out what the real risks are,” said Dr Anne Marie Mahon at the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, who conducted the research.\nMahon said there were two principal concerns: very small plastic particles and the chemicals or pathogens that microplastics can harbour. “If the fibres are there, it is possible that the nanoparticles are there too that we can’t measure,” she said. “Once they are in the nanometre range they can really penetrate a cell and that means they can penetrate organs, and that would be worrying.” The Orb analyses caught particles of more than 2.5 microns in size, 2,500 times bigger than a nanometre.\nMicroplastics can attract bacteria found in sewage, Mahon said: “Some studies have shown there are more harmful pathogens on microplastics downstream of wastewater treatment plants.”\nMicroplastics are also known to contain and absorb toxic chemicals and research on wild animals shows they are released in the body. Prof Richard Thompson, at Plymouth University, UK, told Orb: “It became clear very early on that the plastic would release those chemicals and that actually, the conditions in the gut would facilitate really quite rapid release.” His research has shown microplastics are found in a third of fish caught in the UK.\nThe scale of global microplastic contamination is only starting to become clear, with studies in Germany finding fibres and fragments in all of the 24 beer brands they tested, as well as in honey and sugar. In Paris in 2015, researchers discovered microplastic falling from the air, which they estimated deposits three to 10 tonnes of fibres on the city each year, and that it was also present in the air in people’s homes.\nThis research led Frank Kelly, professor of environmental health at King’s College London, to tell a UK parliamentary inquiry in 2016: “If we breathe them in they could potentially deliver chemicals to the lower parts of our lungs and maybe even across into our circulation.” Having seen the Orb data, Kelly told the Guardian that research is urgently needed to determine whether ingesting plastic particles is a health risk.\nThe new research tested 159 samples using a standard technique to eliminate contamination from other sources and was performed at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. The samples came from across the world, including from Uganda, Ecuador and Indonesia.\nHow microplastics end up in drinking water is for now a mystery, but the atmosphere is one obvious source, with fibres shed by the everyday wear and tear of clothes and carpets. Tumble dryers are another potential source, with almost 80% of US households having dryers that usually vent to the open air.\n“We really think that the lakes [and other water bodies] can be contaminated by cumulative atmospheric inputs,” said Johnny Gasperi, at the University Paris-Est Créteil, who did the Paris studies. “What we observed in Paris tends to demonstrate that a huge amount of fibres are present in atmospheric fallout.”\nPlastic fibres may also be flushed into water systems, with a recent study finding that each cycle of a washing machine could release 700,000 fibres into the environment. Rains could also sweep up microplastic pollution, which could explain why the household wells used in Indonesia were found to be contaminated.\nIn Beirut, Lebanon, the water supply comes from natural springs but 94% of the samples were contaminated. “This research only scratches the surface, but it seems to be a very itchy one,” said Hussam Hawwa, at the environmental consultancy Difaf, which collected samples for Orb.\nCurrent standard water treatment systems do not filter out all of the microplastics, Mahon said: “There is nowhere really where you can say these are being trapped 100%. In terms of fibres, the diameter is 10 microns across and it would be very unusual to find that level of filtration in our drinking water systems.”\nBottled water may not provide a microplastic-free alternative to tapwater, as the they were also found in a few samples of commercial bottled water tested in the US for Orb.\nAlmost 300m tonnes of plastic is produced each year and, with just 20% recycled or incinerated, much of it ends up littering the air, land and sea. A report in July found 8.3bn tonnes of plastic has been produced since the 1950s, with the researchers warning that plastic waste has become ubiquitous in the environment.\n“We are increasingly smothering ecosystems in plastic and I am very worried that there may be all kinds of unintended, adverse consequences that we will only find out about once it is too late,” said Prof Roland Geyer, from the University of California and Santa Barbara, who led the study.\nMahon said the new tap water analyses raise a red flag, but that more work is needed to replicate the results, find the sources of contamination and evaluate the possible health impacts.\nShe said plastics are very useful, but that management of the waste must be drastically improved: “We need plastics in our lives, but it is us that is doing the damage by discarding them in very careless ways.”', 'Water pollution is the contamination of water in water bodies such as rivers, oceans, lakes and swamps. This means that one or more substances have built up in water to the extent of causing problems to people, animals and plants.\nWater pollution means any substance that makes water dirty. Usually, dirty here means unfit for use.\nSo, whether or not water is considered to be polluted will depend on what that water was going to be used for. If it was drinking water, for example, anything that makes it unfit to drink will be considered to be pollution.\nWater Pollution are of various types such as:\n- Based on Origin of pollution\n- point and\n- non-point source water pollution,\n- Water source based\n- ground water pollution surface water pollution),\n- Surface Water Pollution (thermal water pollution, marine pollution, oil spills, etc.)\n- Further there are other forms of water pollution chemical pollution, oxygen depletion of water, suspended water pollution, etc).\nNote: The topic on major types of water pollution in covered in another article. The link for the article: Water Pollution: Major Types of Water Pollution. The causes, effects, and solutions of water pollution are described below.\nCauses of water pollution.\nThere are numerous causes of water pollution. The main ones are listed below.\n- Industrial process: When manufacturers and factories are simply allowed to pour toxic chemicals into water bodies before treatment, the water becomes polluted. The oxygen levels in the water also decreases. The toxic chemicals include: lead, sulphuric acid, mercury and used oil.\n- Inorganic Industrial waste: Inorganic wastes such as acids, mercury, lead and heavy metals can destroy the normal body processes. The presence of these toxic and corrosive substances in water is dangerous to living things. Factories and other industries dump waste products into water at an alarming rate.\n- Agricultural fertilizers: By a process known as leaching, agricultural chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides can wash into rivers and lakes, poisoning them.\n- Untreated sewage from households: Dye, lotion, soap, hair oil, shampoo, powder, deodorant, moisturizer and many other such products also contribute in water pollution. These products go to the sewage without any treatment. Untreated sewage from households can contaminate different water bodies in the process. When sewage pipes break, there is a chance that the wastes will contaminate drinking water. Sometimes, poorly treated sewage is released into water bodies. Domestic cleaning products can be very dangerous pollutants.\n- Garbage: Plastics are non-biodegradable. Mass plastics clog water bodies and contaminate water.\n- Urbanization: Urbanization is a key factor in increasing the amounts of water pollution.\n- Dumping solid waste: Humans often carelessly dump their trash in the sea or near rivers.\n- Oil spills: Accidental oil spills have a devastating effect on seas.\n- Dissolved gases: Polluting gases in the air can dissolve into salt and fresh water and pollute it.\n- Boat fuels: Fossil fuels used in the shipping industry are one of the largest causes of both air and water pollution.\n- Heated water from power plants: Some power plants release the heated water into water bodies. This reduces the oxygen content in water. Power plants normally use heated water to cool their machines.\nEffects of water pollution.\nWater pollution damages human health, makes our living conditions precarious and threatens life on the planet.\n- Water becomes dangerous to drink: Humans have less safe drinking water.\n- Less clean water for agriculture: we need unpolluted water to irrigate crops, too.\n- Economic costs: When water has been polluted, there is money needed to purify water, remove plastics from water bodies and so on.\n- Change in water color: Polluted water becomes visibly different.\n- Water-borne diseases: Living near to polluted water can put humans at risk of diseases. Water-borne diseases: When sewage combines with drinking water, there is a likelihood of a breakout of diseases. If people end up drinking this water, they might suffer from diseases such as typhoid, cholera and dysentery.\n- Treatment plants. Treatment plants should be set up especially in cities where huge amount of water goes to drain daily. Water flowing through the drainage system should be properly treated and harmful pollutants removed.\n- Fewer possibilities for leisure: Swimming, sailing, surfing and other water sports are definitely not advised in polluted water.\n- Acidic rain: When toxic gases and smoke is released from industries, cars and homes, the gases lead to formation of acid rain. Acidic rain is a threat to human health and it also affects the living organisms in soil.\n- Genetic mutations: The genes of marine and freshwater plants and animals mutate\n- Acid oceans: pollution causes the oceans to acidify.\n- Algae bloom: An excess of oxygen in waters due to a change in the chemical composition causes algae to bloom in overabundance and block out the light in pools and river.\n- Damage to the ecosystems: Ecosystem is the interaction of living things, depending on each other for life. When their habits become polluted, marine and freshwater organisms are at risk of extinction. When aquatic life is threatened the entire ecosystem is disturbed.\n- Avoid pouring medicine and insecticides in toilets and sinks: Throw such waste in the bathroom toilet. This is important because if poured in toilets and sinks, these products could combine to form harmful products.\n- Use manure instead of fertilizers. Manure should be used instead of fertilizers because unlike fertilizers, it does not contain harmful chemicals.\nSolutions to water pollution.\nIt is in our power to halt water pollution. Some of the key solutions that can be applied are outlined below.\n- Stop using harmful chemicals at home: Opt for environmentally friendly household cleaners.\n- Prevent industrial waste reaching water: Dispose of industrial waste by burying or neutralizing it instead.\n- Sewage treatment: Household water should be properly treated to make it environmentally safe. Raw sewage should never be pumped into water. This may seem like a convenient way of disposing of it but it is highly dangerous for health. Effective sewage treatment processes should be put in place.\n- Treatment of industrial wastes before discharge: Factories should treat wastes before discharge and toxic substances should be converted into harmless materials.\n- Recycle: Recycle domestic and commercial waste safely rather than dumping it in the sea or near rivers.\n- Promote a love for waterways: That way, everyone in the community will be motivated to stop pollution. When we all work together, we can achieve great things.\n- Go organic: Organic agriculture uses far fewer chemical pesticides and fertilizers.\n- Adherence to water laws. Laws and legislation regarding water pollution should be strictly followed. There should be heavy penalties for those who fail to adhere to the rules.\n- Avoid using paper bags: Carry a shopping bag whenever you expect to go shopping. This will minimize the chances of you using a paper bag. You can also buy a portable shopping bag and always have it with you.\n- Improve oil tanker safety: Avoiding oil spills would remove a key cause of environmental pollution.\n- Routine cleaning: Wells, and lakes should be regularly cleaned and treated to ensure that they remain safe for human use. There should also be system of regularly testing pond and lake water.\nFurther, you may also like to read 29 Ways to Control Water Pollution. We hope that you would find it interesting.\nWater is a basic necessity. If water pollution is not controlled, this commodity might become a commodity that only few can afford. As such, we should all take action from today onward reduce water pollution. What is more, we should encourage friends and loved ones – and those with power and authority – to do the same before it is too late.']	['<urn:uuid:3ed58397-6754-4ef7-8dae-8ba0a6a05254>', '<urn:uuid:11303d35-b779-4602-b63f-778f2e3583ad>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	35	153	2431
96	How do welding positions and hand techniques compare when it comes to achieving optimal welding results?	For optimal welding positions, flat or horizontal positions are ideal and can increase deposition rates by 100-150% compared to out-of-position welding (vertical up, overhead, 3 o'clock) where gravity works against the welder. For hand techniques, MIG welding requires using both hands - one for moving the gun and one for steadying it, while maintaining a comfortable, relaxed position.	"['Many of our customers realize that there is a great potential for reducing costs in welding operations. Yet, not many are willing to attack this area of manufacturing. The reason for this is that welding is a very complicated industrial process. It has many variables that come into play which determine quality and productivity. So if it’s not broken it is left alone. However, there are simple in which you can see immediate costs savings.\nEliminate Overwelding– Make sure welds are properly sized by following what is called out on the print. Don’t have prints? Develop them! The savings can be huge. Do you know that if your print calls for a 3/16” fillet and you deposit at ¼” fillet instead you are overwelding by 78%? That’s right! 78%. To get a better sense of how much overwelding may be costing read the article on Cost of Overwelding.\nReduce the amount of reinforcement– Multiple pass welds on a groove joint typically end up with a certain amount of reinforcement. The goal is to be just above flush to prevent underfill. However, a 1/8″ reinforcement will not be better than a 3/32″ or even a 1/16″.\nUse proper polarity– In applications were penetration is not important or desired, such as hardfacing, use DC- to achieve greater deposition rates. Similar benefits can be had by increasing contact-tip-to-work-distance (CTTWD), but be careful if you are using a wire process that requires gas shielding.\nReduce gaps – Gaps increase the volume of weld needed. You typically will need to increase the leg size of your fillet welds by the size of the gap if you want to get the same strength (determined by the weld’s throat). So if you have a ¼” gap and you were require to put down a ¼” fillet weld, you know have to deposit a ½” weld to obtain comparable strength. You are not doubling your filler metal needs, you are quadrupling them! Don’t assume that welders can fill all gaps, consider improving upstream operations such holding tight tolerances on part dimensions.\nIn many cases gaps are not a product of bad design, they are a fabrication issue. Getting parts to fit perfectly is not an easy task, but one that must be mastered. For more information on what bad fit up can be costing you read The Outrageous Cost of Poor Fit Up.\nControl flow shielding gas flow rates – For processes that require shielding gas make sure no more flow than necessary is used. Too much flow will waste gas and can even create weld defects. For GMAW typical flow rates will range from 25 – 50 cubic feet per hour; however, we constantly see flowmeters that are pegged, running 100CFH+.\nLearn more ways in which you may be wasting gas: How to Know if You Are Wasting Shielding Gas.\nIncrease electrode diameter –Whether you are stick welding or mig welding, consider using a larger electrode to achieve higher deposition rates. The material thickness and joint will determine if this is feasible. But if you are using .035” wire on ½” plate you should seriously look at .045” and .052” diameters.\nConsider intermittent instead of continuous fillets – Not all fillet welds need to be continuous, especially when welding stiffeners. If you are welding stiffeners with full-length fillet welds consult with your engineering department and see if you can switch to intermittent welds.\nSelect the right process – Don’t TIG weld if MIG will do. Sticking? Can you use a wire process?\nProperly position the work for optimal efficiency– ideally we want to weld in the flat or horizontal position. Welding out of position (vertical up, overhead, 3 0’clock, etc.) reduces deposition rates because gravity works against us and forces to run smaller puddles. In many cases welding in the flat or horizontal position can increase deposition rates by 100 to 150%.\nUse fixtures – We get fixtures for robots to increase the time the arc is on. Why don’t we do this for welders? The right fixture can have a significant impact on operator factor.\nUse procedures and processes that eliminate spatter– Consider using 90/10 gas instead of C25 or 100% CO2. Consider pulse welding instead of CV welding. Spatter reduces the efficiency of the filler metal by as much as 5%. However, the real cost is the time it takes to remove the spatter. Eliminate spatter and you can significantly reduce labor costs. Do you think spatter isn’t a big deal? Take a look at The Real Cost of Welding Spatter.\nYou don’t have to apply all eleven of these cost savings initiatives. Pick one or two and it can make a big impact on your welding operations.', ""How to Weld With a MIG Welder? – [Know the Basics]\nLearning how to weld can be quite frustrating.\nGladly, we’ve compiled this comprehensive tutorial for those looking to learn to MIG weld without going to class.\nBe as it may, MIG welding is relatively easy to learn compared to other welding techniques.\nThis is because in MIG welding, starting the arc will only require pulling of the trigger as opposed to striking a match as we see in stick welding.\nSecondly, the wire in MIG welding automatically feeds into the weld puddle, saving you from the hassles of manual feed.\nFinally, the electrode in MIG welding does not burn away and become shorter. Instead, you’ll simply need to move steadily along a seam, while maintaining the same tip to arc distance.\nNow, enough with the rambling, let’s get started on how to weld with a MIG welder.\nPreparation for MIG Welding\nConsider the Thickness of the Metal\nBefore using your MIG welder, you should first consider the thickness of the metals you intend to weld.\nFor instance, if you’re working on aluminum, the appropriate thickness is 14 Ga. or more.\nFailure to that you might experience burning on your metal or weld puddle falling through fast, especially if you’re not quick enough.\nThe Shielding Gas To Be Used\nThe choice and combination of gases for your MIG weld will depend on the metal as well as its thickness.\nAluminum requires pure argon, while steel MIG weld, on the other hand, requires C25 gas. The C25 is a combination of 25% CO2 and 75% argon.\nType of Electrodes to be Used\nIdeally, your choice of electrode should match the metal you’re welding. For instance, if you’re welding aluminum, we recommend that you use an aluminum electrode.\nBeyond the electrode type, you need to consider the thickness of the electrode.\nThicker wires, for instance, are challenging to melt, while the thinner wires are hard to feed. Therefore recommend that you settle for the middle ground.\nAlways your tool polarity to DCEP when MIG welding\nDCEP, popularly known as reverse polarity will guarantee an effective weld.\nPractice Bead Laying\nPracticing bead laying will provide you with a feel for the MIG setting, and determine whether they need a change.\nBasics of MIG Welding\nAssuming everything is set, you can now start to MIG weld. While at it, there’re various guidelines that you need to follow.\nHere are some of them:\n- 1While MIG welding ensures the wire extending from your gun is at least ¼ to 3/8 inch from the metal. This distance is close enough to allow the shielding gas to protect the arc, and at the same time, far away to avoid burning up tips.\n- 2Use both hands when welding. One hand should be used to move the gun, while the other for steadying it — only weld when you're in a comfy and relaxed position.\n- 3Always keep the wire pointed at the leading edge of the molten pool\n- 4If you’re looking for greater penetration and narrow weld, pull the weld along the seam. For less penetration and wider bead, push the bead. If you’re in doubt pull on the heavier material and push on the lighter material\n- 5If you’re welding overhead, keep the puddle small and try to use the smallest diameter. This keeps the weld in the crack as opposed to the floor.\nFactors that Determine the Success of your MIG Welding\nThe three factors that will play a significant role in the overall success of your MIG welding are:\nIf for instance, you notice you’re making many holes on your metal fabric, it either means the heat setting is too high, or you’re moving at a slow pace.\nIf, on the other hand, you're getting little to no penetration, it means you're traveling too quickly, or your heat setting is too low.\nIf the wire melts almost before it starts to work or it pulses in and out, it means your feed rate is too slow. Conversely, if the wire pushes the gun away from work, it implies your feed rate is too fast.\nTo know if you’re on the right track, your MIG weld should generate a nice and even bead. This bead should further be accompanied by a distinctive and soothing buzz sound.\nWhile MIG welding, keep the wires as straight as possible. This should help to prevent the wire from tangling or misfeeding.\nFor the optimum efficiency, keep the gun tilted at 45-degree angle. This will allow you to easily see the puddle.\nRead more: How to Use a MIG Welder?\nLearning how to MIG weld will require patience and persistence.\nTake your time, and follow the laid out guidelines and with time, you’ll perfect your trade.""]"	['<urn:uuid:8e183d49-c948-45da-885a-6363e4fd96cf>', '<urn:uuid:a9a18711-ad4e-41f7-a791-25c1ecb3ef28>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	16	58	1580
97	Having worked in both Hollywood and indie productions, I'd like to understand how the approach to recording ambient sound differs between professional and amateur filmmaking, particularly regarding its importance in post-production?	Professional and amateur filmmaking have contrasting approaches to ambient sound recording. In professional Hollywood productions, all sound effects are typically added in post-production, allowing for creative control over every sound - from footsteps to door creaks - to achieve specific moods and character. Amateur filmmakers often overlook recording atmosphere tracks (also called room tone), making it difficult for editors to patch up gaps in sound or hide undesirable noise. Without proper ambient sound recording, editors must forage for tiny bits of ambience between dialogue, limiting their creative options. The professional approach emphasizes recording clean dialogue without overlapping sound effects, giving more options in the mix, while amateurs often record everything together, reducing post-production flexibility. Additionally, professionals plan ahead by visiting locations to assess potential sound issues and working with dedicated sound personnel from pre-production, while amateurs tend to treat sound as an afterthought.	"['You know what marks a film out as amateur more than anything else? Shoddy, shoddy location sound.\nI fully understand and have been guilty of this. For a director sound is a difficult thing to get excited about. Every year the industry announces bigger and better cameras promising fantastic, breathtaking HD visuals.\nWhilst advances in sound mean that it’s… slightly clearer? Maybe… if you really listen…\nHowever from the moment I became an editor I have been forced to amend my ways. Now whenever I meet a director as they are about to embark on a shoot I drop to my knees and beg them to pour their resources into the sound. Usually to no avail.\nDirectors, these are the things that make me hate you.\n1. Unclean Dialogue\nMy heart always sinks when I’m sat with a director, looking through rushes in the edit suite and I see something along the lines of the following:\nCharacters talking in front of traffic, running water, music, crowds and the list goes on.\nYou can just edit that stuff out right?\nBut aren’t there filters? Ah yes. Filters. Sure, in some cases you may be able to clean it up a little but it still won’t sound good. Just a different ever so slightly lesser kind of terrible.\nAnd don’t ever say, “We’ll just ADR it”. ADR, unless you have access to the right facilities or really know what you’re doing, should always be an absolute last resort. It’s not just about having the actor spout their lines in time with the picture. You need to get the right sound perspective, you need the right microphone and it needs to match the other elements that you’re not adr-ing. And who are you kidding? You’ll probably be too broke for that stuff anyway come postproduction.\n2. Overlapping Sound Effects\nFootsteps (high heels in particular) and any objects that your characters may be messing with throughout a scene cause endless headaches in the edit.\nYou might think that footsteps are ok. You’re going to need the footsteps there eventually anyway, right? So what’s the harm in leaving them in? The harm is, it reduces options. With everything you leave in, it reduces what you are able to do with the mix in post. Artfully applied sponges can be a quick fix here, or laying down a carpet depending where and what you’re shooting. If possible have your actors switch to a different, softer set of shoes for the close ups. If you’re inside it’s as simple as just having your actors remove their shoes.\nThis same rule applies to all other actions in a scene. If you’re character is doing something out of frame that makes noise, such as making tea, fiddling with a lock or typing on a computer then have them mime it. If I can’t see it, I don’t want to hear it.\nOn your typical Hollywood movie (and say what you will about them, they always sound awesome) all these sound effects will be added in post. Why? Because maybe you don’t want the door to make that particular kind of creak. Maybe you want the villain’s footsteps to have a more ominous quality. Every sound has a certain character or mood to it. Clever use of sound effects can open up a whole new dimension of creative possibilities and it’s something that new filmmakers often overlook.\n3. No Atmos / Wild Tracks\nThe more your location sound sucks, the more I need this. And unfortunately the more your location sound sucks, the less likely it is that you recorded one.\nUsually this results in me foraging around for the tiny bits of ambience I can lift from in between dialogue. Fun stuff.\nWhat’s an atmos track you ask? Some people call it room tone. It’s a recording of the ambient sound (the Atmosphere) of the location. In editing it is used to patch up gaps in the sound or to hide any undesirable noise.\n4. No Forward Planning\nSound is such an after thought for so many filmmakers. Get a sound guy on board early on. Show them your locations. Figure out what the problems might be and start coming up with solutions. They need to be kept in the loop as they will need to know what gear they’re going to need in order to deal with the challenges of a particular location. They’ll be able to flag up any potential problems and you may be able to alter your plan to get better results.\nAnd even if you’re not working with a professional, make sure you have someone whose sole concern is the sound from the get go. Don’t just thrust a boom pole toward whoever isn’t doing anything on the day.\n5. Loud Locations\nPeople tend to choose locations based entirely on looks. Which is fine for the most part. However, you really need to spend a little time in any location you plan to spend a decent amount of time shooting in. Just go there for maybe 10-20 minutes and listen. Planes, wind, traffic, nearby fire station, next door neighbour’s rowdy dog. You need to know what you’re going to be dealing with.\nPlanes and wind noise are a particular problem as they can be there in one shot and gone the next.\n6. Not Respecting the Sound Guy\nThe amount of times I see ads asking for experienced sound guys with their own kit to show up unpaid on a shoot… oh and by the way, we’re shooting tomorrow…\nYou have to ask yourself exactly what they get from it. Unlike your DoP or your cast they aren’t going to be getting showreel material from it. Whilst your DoP is presenting finished pictures and your cast their whole performance, the sound recordists work is the first stage of a long process. It’s more like getting a clean green screen shot for effects in post. It’ll be stunning eventually, but right now we just need it as clear and plain as possible.\nToo much of the sound editors job in the low budget world is damage limitation rather than making your film sound the very best it can. Make their job easier and they can put their time to far better use.\nHere at Raindance we have the unique perspective that comes from being one of the UK’s foremost film training providers and Europe’s largest independent film festival. We see filmmakers when they’re just starting out and we see their debuts up on the screen. And you know what strikes me about the shorts and features that make it? They all sound pretty damn good. Put simply:\nSOUND IS VERY IMPORTANT\nIt cannot be stressed enough…. that…\nYou’re not listening to me are you? You’re looking at that Red camera…', '""Ensure your Movie\nhas the best possible video sound track.""\nArticle by Will Hutchinson\nTo a dedicated stills photographer, sound may only\nhave reared its noisy head in the form of random canned music piped\nalong to a slideshow. When it comes to making moving images of any\nlength or genre however, sound should be considered with extra care.\nEver since the release of the first proper talkie - The Jazz Singer, in\n1927 - sound in all its forms has been inextricably embedded in movies,\nindeed some consider it to be responsible for as much as 90% of the\nwhole movie viewing experience.\nWhile thinking about this extra\ndimension, I stepped out into the walled garden behind my office. I\ncould hear the bang and crash of a neighbouring building site, the\nshouts of children at playtime in a nearby school, a distant siren, an\naeroplane on its way to Heathrow, and several squawking seagulls. In\njust a few seconds, I heard and understood a complex and constant\nsoundtrack, none of which I could actually see, but all of which I\ncould distinguish perfectly.\nRECORDING: BASIC TIPS\ncamera, SOUND, action! The single best piece of advice is simply to be\nconscious that you are recording audio, and that you have another set\nof factors to consider before hitting ‘record’. As well as looking at\nyour subject, listen to it. Are you shooting directly into the wind?\nCan you wait until that ambulance has passed out of earshot? Is your\nsubject clearly audible?\nSound should be considered equally important\nas exposure or focus. Have you got the best composition for both sound\nand picture? Be aware that audio recording is also sensitive to sound\noutside your field of view, and that, while people talking behind the\ncamera won’t be seen, they will most certainly be heard. Don\'t be\nafraid to use the legendary words, \'Quiet on set!\'\nCutting from one\nshot to another at the editing stage creates discontinuity, but having\nan audio track that blends between shots can restore this continuity.\nWith this in mind, hold your shot a little longer at the start and end\nof a take, to give you some leeway in the edit, and consider recording\nsome background noise to add ambience later.\nIf you are outside in a\nwindy situation, find somewhere sheltered from direct wind, and record\nsome atmosphere from there.

However,\nas well as the additional cost and hassle of syncing separate audio,\nthe benefits of shooting HD video on a small, unobtrusive device are\nnegated if you need an extra pair of hands for recording sound.\ndon’t record audio separately, a dedicated microphone will help improve\nresults, especially if recording outside.

(All of these almond ingredients also make these cookies smell amazing!)\nHow long can you store crescent cookies?\nHow Long Can You Keep This In The Fridge? This vanilla crescent cookies recipe will keep in the fridge for 5-7 days and will last up to 2-3 weeks when stored in an airtight container in a cool dry place. Good luck keeping them that long, though!\nDo drop cookies do not spread as much as rolled cookies during baking?\nDropped Cookies do not spread as much as rolled cookies during baking. The conventional mixing method used for shortened cakes is used to mix all types of cookies. Cookie sheets should be hot when cookies are placed on them for baking. Cookie sheets should touch the sides of the oven when cookies are baking.\nCan you freeze crescent cookies?\nYES! These cookies freeze beautifully. There are two ways to choose from when planning on freezing your pecan crescent cookies. ONE—Form the dough into a ball, put it in a freezer bag, label and freeze.\nWhat is the difference between Ricciarelli and amaretti?\nRicciarelli are Tuscan cookies related to amaretti; they’re made with an egg-white based dough that lends them a light, fluffy character. Texture-wise, these cookies are softer and chewier than most amaretti.\nWhy do my Almond Cookies crack?\nGetting perfectly crackled ricciarelli cookies\nWith ricciarelli, you roll each ball of dough in powdered sugar before baking. When it cooks, the dough on the inside expands and breaks through the dried exterior, allowing golden cracks to show through the white outside.\nWhich type of cookie is biscotti?\nBiscotti (/bɪˈskɒti/; Italian pronunciation: [biˈskɔtti]; English: biscuits), known also as cantucci ([kanˈtuttʃi]), are Italian almond biscuits that originated in the Tuscan city of Prato. They are twice-baked, oblong-shaped, dry, crunchy, and may be dipped in a drink, traditionally Vin Santo.\nWhat is a typical Chinese dessert?\nDesserts in China are quite different from in the West.

Next, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and store it in the freezer for up to 3 months. When you’re ready, allow the dough to thaw in the freezer overnight and follow the baking instructions as usual.\nWhy do my cookies stay in a ball?\nToo Much Flour\nThe most common reason why your cookies don’t spread is that you’ve added too much flour. Adding more dry ingredients than the recipe calls for can result in a dough that is too stiff. Moisture and fat in the dough are soaked up by the excessive amount of flour which takes away its ability to spread.\nShould I flatten cookies before baking?\nAnd there are no baking police: If your recipe tells you to flatten your cookies before baking, you just go ahead and do that however you want. So long as they end up evenly flat, that is; squashing cookies haphazardly under your palm means they may bake and brown unevenly.\nWhy would you double pan a batch of cookies?\nWhy would you double-pan a batch of cookies? To prevent burning the bottoms of the cookies. A cookie is said to be “short” if it is _ in fat and _ in gluten development. The following factors all increase spread in cookies: heavily greased pans, high sugar content, high liquid content, high oven temperature.\nIs biscotti better with oil or butter?\nDespite their centuries-old heritage, there is no one perfect way to make biscotti. Some recipes call for eggs only, which is the traditional method, while others swear by butter or oil. The choice is yours; just keep in mind that those made with butter or oil will have both a softer texture and a shorter shelf life.\nWhat are the 7 types of cookies?\nSo here are 7 Types of Cookie!\nIs biscotti a bread or a cookie?\nBiscotti are an old cookie, with origins in medieval Italy.

99	salesforce einstein analytics features security risks	Salesforce Einstein Analytics offers features like advanced reporting with predictive intelligence, data manipulation, and integration of multiple data sources. However, it faces security risks including malware attacks, data leakage, account hijacking, and insider threats that can compromise the stored data.	"['Salesforce Einstein Analytics Cloud is a powerful BI Platform which is powered by Artificial Intelligence. Salesforce recently revealed this platform for its CRM Customers. This platform has opened path to several amazing features for CRM users, enabling them to use advanced reporting with predictive intelligence instead of legacy based old analytics. The data may be inside SFDC or may reside in the other external system. You can explore your data to discover new, unexpected insights for your business. Based on the latest data you can create dashboards to continually monitor key business metrics and you can also know how your business is going on by getting instant Visualization. Analytics-cloud gives you feature of data manipulation (extract, merge, conditioning, transformation, appending, etc.). For Example, you can merge two or more different datasets and twist it to generate new view/report.\nThere are multiple ways to import data in Einstein Analytics. For example Salesforce, CSV file and external sources by ETL tools. You can use the External Data API to import data Programmatically.\nAstrea Team has built a smart Custom Connector in Java to Load Hubspot API data into Wave. HubSpot is a software product for inbound marketing and sales. HubSpot provides tools for social media marketing, content management, web analytics, landing pages and search engine optimization. HubSpot has integration features for Salesforce.com, SugarCRM, NetSuite, Microsoft Dynamics CRM and others. There are also third-party services such as templates and extensions.\nInitially, we have considered Contacts, Engagement Objects etc of Hubspot API for our Hubspot Wave Connector. Our Connector pulls the data from these objects and pushes the same into Wave to create datasets for Reports/Charts Building. We also provides Scheduler facility in our Hubspot connector so that the Businesses can push the Hubspot data at their convenient time interval for analysis.\nNeed For Hubspot Wave Connector:\nHubspot CRM can store 1,000,000 contacts per account. So it is not possible to store and handle this much data in any other Cloud Based BI Tool if the Business House want to Create Dashboards on Hubspot Data(usually impose data size limitation of around 10MBs only in Various Cloud based BI Platforms) and hence we have made Hubspot Wave Connector For Hubspot API. We are storing and handle GBs of data in Custom Connector. There are some limitation to External Data API.\nLink to External Data Limits:\n- Tunnel Chart: Contacts Created Per Month\n- Map Chart: Contacts Per Country\n- TreeMap Chart: Contacts Per Country\n- Tunnel Chart: Engagement Per Type\n- Waterfall Chart: Engagement Per Type\nThe need to integrate data from multiple data sources is very important in many ""use cases"" for Salesforce Einstein Analytics, particularly where users require a complete view of what is happening across multiple business domains for e.g Various KPIs from other external systems like Hubspot,Shopify , Facebook, Google Analytics etc. To achieve this, the process of loading and transforming data from multiple sources to Wave ( Einstein Analytics) is necessary.\nWave Analytics provides a variety of flexible options to load data. Use the native Dataflow to load data from Salesforce, or use any other ETL tools for external data. You can also validate business requirements and analyze the data shapes by using other options like CSV file. A ""Custom Connector"" can be built using Wave\'s External Data API for loading the data from any other external API/System.\nAstrea’s Hubspot Custom Connector for Salesforce Einstein Analytics Cloud lets you connect to the Salesforce Einstein Analytics Cloud application using the Salesforce External Data API. The connector exposes convenient methods for creating and populating Hubspot data sets into Salesforce Einstein Analytics Cloud system. It provides built-in functionality for batch processing of Jobs for getting data from Hubspot API.', ""Salesforce is a cloud-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform that has revolutionized the way organizations manage their customer data. With Salesforce, businesses can access data from anywhere and leverage it to make informed decisions. As an organization's largest container of data, Salesforce is also a target for cybercriminals. In this blog, we will explore the threats to Salesforce data and the steps organizations can take to safeguard their most valuable asset.\nUnderstanding Salesforce Data Threats\nSalesforce data threats come in many forms, including:\n- Malware and Ransomware: Malware can infect Salesforce accounts through email phishing or by downloading malicious software. Ransomware can encrypt files and demand payment in exchange for the decryption key.\n- Data Leakage: Data leakage occurs when sensitive information is disclosed to unauthorized parties. Data breaches can occur due to human error, such as misconfiguration, or malicious attacks.\n- Account Hijacking: Account hijacking occurs when an attacker gains unauthorized access to a Salesforce account. This can be done through password cracking, social engineering, or exploiting vulnerabilities.\n- Insider Threats: Insider threats occur when employees, contractors, or partners with access to Salesforce data misuse or leak data. Insider threats can be accidental or intentional.\nBest Practices for Securing Salesforce Data\nTo protect Salesforce data, organizations should implement the following best practices:\n- Use Multi-Factor Authentication: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to Salesforce logins. With MFA, users must provide additional authentication factors, such as a one-time password or biometric authentication.\n- Restrict Access: Limit access to Salesforce data to only those who need it. Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) to restrict access based on job function.\n- Encrypt Data: Encryption is the process of encoding data to protect it from unauthorized access. Salesforce offers encryption at rest and in transit, which ensures that data is protected both while it's being stored and when it's being transmitted.\n- Implement Monitoring and Alerting: Monitor Salesforce activity for suspicious behavior, such as failed login attempts, and set up alerts to notify administrators of potential threats.\n- Conduct Regular Audits: Conduct regular audits of Salesforce data to ensure that access is restricted appropriately and that sensitive data is not being leaked.\n2Partnering with a Salesforce Security Expert\nPartnering with a Salesforce security expert can help organizations protect their data by:\n- Conducting Risk Assessments: Salesforce security experts can assess an organization's security posture and identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.\n- Providing Guidance on Best Practices: Salesforce security experts can provide guidance on best practices for securing Salesforce data, such as implementing MFA, restricting access, and encrypting data.\n- Implementing Security Controls: Salesforce security experts can help organizations implement security controls, such as RBAC and monitoring and alerting.\n- Providing Incident Response: In the event of a security breach, a Salesforce security expert can provide incident response services, such as containing the breach, investigating the incident, and restoring data.\nAdditional Considerations for Salesforce Data Security\n- Data Backup and Recovery: While preventive measures are essential for protecting Salesforce data, it's also critical to have a data backup and recovery plan in place. This ensures that organizations can quickly recover from a data breach or loss.\n- Regular Software Updates: Regularly updating Salesforce software is crucial for maintaining data security. Software updates often include security patches that address known vulnerabilities and protect against new threats.\n- User Training and Awareness: Educating users on Salesforce security best practices and potential threats is essential. This includes training on password hygiene, recognizing phishing emails, and reporting suspicious activity.\n- Third-Party Integrations: Many organizations integrate third-party applications with Salesforce to enhance functionality. However, these integrations can pose security risks if not adequately vetted. Organizations should ensure that all third-party applications are properly assessed for security risks before integrating them into Salesforce.\n- Compliance with Regulations: Organizations must comply with industry regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA, that govern the handling and protection of customer data. Compliance requirements vary depending on the industry and location, so organizations must understand the regulations that apply to them and implement necessary security measures.\nIn today's digital landscape, data security is a top concern for organizations of all sizes. Salesforce is an essential tool for managing customer data, but it's also a target for cybercriminals. By understanding the threats to Salesforce data and implementing best practices for securing it, organizations can minimize the risk of a data breach. Additionally, partnering with a Salesforce security expert can provide additional protection and ensure that organizations are fully prepared to respond to a security incident. With a comprehensive security strategy in place, organizations can leverage Salesforce to drive business success while keeping their data safe.\nSalesforce data is an organization's most valuable asset, and protecting it should be a top priority. By understanding the threats to Salesforce data and implementing best practices for securing it, organizations can minimize the risk of a data breach. Partnering with a Salesforce security expert can provide additional protection and ensure that organizations are fully prepared to respond to a security incident.""]"	['<urn:uuid:7b3d90a2-d7c0-431b-9121-ddc2f8c18921>', '<urn:uuid:550212e7-78a8-4d95-a363-d153ba636e4c>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:48:52.796658	6	40	1453
100	einstein household religious practices father jewish what religion einstein children receive	Although Einstein was born into a non-practising Jewish family, the family practiced no formal religion in their home and Einstein did not want his children to receive any form of religious instruction.	"['Important Dates and Discoveries\nCosmological Theories Through History\nThe Universe By Numbers\nGlossary of Terms\nA Few Random Facts\nAlbert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist, best known for his Special and General Theory of Relativity and the concept of mass-energy equivalence expressed by the famous equation, E = mc2. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 “for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect” and he made some essential contributions to the early development of quantum theory. He was named ""Person of the Century"" by Time magazine in 1999, the fourth most admired person of the 20th Century according to a 1999 Gallup poll, and “the greatest scientist of the twentieth century and one of the supreme intellects of all time” according to “The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History” in 1978.\nAlbert Einstein was born into a non-practising Jewish family in Ulm in the Kingdom of Württemberg, Germany on 14 March 1879. He was always a little different from other children: his head was slightly larger than normal, and he hardly spoke as a young boy, leading one housekeeper to consider him ""retarded"". At an early age, his family moved to Munich where Einstein attended a Catholic school and showed an early aptitude for mathematics, particularly geometry and calculus (although he disliked the school\'s policy of strict memorization, which he thought unhelpful). Outside of school, he explored his own path of learning in mathematics and philosophy with a medical student and friend of the family, Max Talmud.\nAt 15, after his father’s electrical equipment business failed, he followed his family to Pavia, Italy (not wishing to stay and finish his schooling in Germany), and then on to Aarau, Switzerland, where he finally finished high school. At the age of just 16, he had already made his first conceptual breakthrough while looking at a mirror and wondering what he would see if he were travelling at the speed of light (a thought experiment sometimes referred to as ""Einstein\'s Mirror""). In 1896, he renounced his German citizenship in order to avoid military service, and went to study mathematics and physics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich, graduating in 1900. He gained Swiss citizenship in 1901 and never revoked it.\nUnable to find a teaching post after graduation, Einstein eventually obtained a job evaluating patent applications for electromagnetic devices at the Swiss patent office in Bern. He married a Serb woman named Mileva Maric in 1903, and the couple were to bear two sons, Hans Albert (1904) and Eduard (1910), (and possibly another child, Lieserl, before their marriage, who either died in childhood or was put up for adoption), before divorcing in 1919.\nIn 1905, sometimes referred to as his “annus mirabilis” (wonderful year), and while he was still working in the patent office, the young 26 year old Einstein completed his PhD (with a thesis on ""A new determination of molecular dimensions"") and had no less than four important papers published in the “Annalen der Physik”, the leading German physics journal:\nMuch of this work was highly controversial (or just ignored) within the scientific community of the time, and he continued his work at the patent office until 1908. But he had earned his PhD from the University of Zürich in 1905, and he was eventually able to obtain a privatdozent position at the University of Bern in 1908, followed by brief teaching posts at the University of Zürich and the University of Prague in 1911.\nDuring this time he continued to publish papers, but it was only on moving back to the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich in 1912 that he began working in earnest on a generalization of his theory of relativity. He benefitted from the mathematical assistance of his old friend Marcel Grossman, who was one of the only people in Zurich with whom Einstein could discuss his new ideas. He moved on to Berlin in 1914 (at the personal request of Max Planck), where he became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, a director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics and a professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin, as well as maintaining an ongoing relationship with Leiden University in the Netherlands (through his contacts there with the physicists Hendrik Lorentz and Willem de Sitter). He became actively involved in anti-war demonstrations during World War I, publicly advocating civil disobedience and the refusal of conscription.\nEinstein gave a series of lectures in 1915 about his new theory, which was to become known as the General Theory of Relativity, including a new equation to replace Newton\'s law of gravity, now known as Einstein\'s field equation. The complete theory was finally published in 1916, although physicists and mathematicians like Karl Schwarzschild and Ludwig Flamm were starting to publish solutions to his field equations even before its publication. General relativity is based on the notion that gravity and acceleration are indistinguishable (the principle of equivalence) and describes gravity as a property of the geometry (or, more specifically, the warpage) of space-time, leading to the prediction of phenomena like the bending of light, black holes and wormholes.\nA year later, Einstein published a paper introducing a new notion into his General Theory of Relativity, a sort of anti-gravity force which he called the “cosmological constant” that kept the universe from collapsing in on itself, in an attempt to model the behaviour of the entire universe, while retaining his firm belief in a Newtonian infinite, static model of the universe. He later called this idea his “greatest blunder” although, in the light of recent discoveries about the accelerating universe and dark energy, it is beginning to look remarkably prescient.\nHe divorced Mileva Maric in 1919, having lived apart for the last five years, and within months of the divorce, married his cousin Elsa Löwenthal (who had nursed him through an illness) and together they raised Margot and Ilse, Elsa\'s daughters from her first marriage.\nDespite the attempts by many scientists to disprove the General Theory of Relativity, the British astronomer Arthur Eddington claimed in 1919 to have confirmed Einstein\'s prediction of the gravitational deflection of starlight by the Sun, leading, almost overnight, to global renown and international media attention for Einstein. His fellow scientists began to speak of general relativity in terms such as ""probably the greatest scientific discovery ever made"" and ""the greatest feat of human thinking about nature"". He was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics, “for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect” (i.e. not for his theory of relativity).\nEinstein spent the next few years travelling extensively, giving lectures around the world. Throughout the 1920s, he engaged in an extended public debate with Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg over the inherently probabilistic “Copenhagen interpretation” of quantum mechanics, with which he was never quite happy from a philosophical stand-point, claiming in 1926 that “I, at any rate, am convinced that He [God] does not throw dice"". He tried to develop thought experiments whereby Heisenberg\'s uncertainty principle might be violated but, each time, Bohr found loopholes in Einstein\'s reasoning.\nDuring the First World War, Einstein had campaigned vigorously against the war, supporting various anti-War and pacifist organizations. He remained a staunch pacifist even after the end of the War, and was highly critical of nationalism and committed to the idea of a single world government free of a military. Throughout the 1920s, he continued to participate in numerous peace campaigns and wrote articles on international peace and disarmament. He was also was drawn to the Zionist cause during the 1920s, despite its nationalistic character.\nHis physics research after general relativity consisted primarily of a long series of (largely unsuccessful) attempts to generalize his theory of gravitation still further in order to unify and simplify the fundamental laws of physics, particularly gravitation and electromagnetism. He was desparate to come up with a unified field theory, a ""theory of everything"" that would refute the claims of quantum theory, which he never came to terms with. He went so far as to publish a paper in 1929, which purported to be just such a theory, and which attracted huge media attention, but he was forced to admit to errors and back-tracked rapidly, losing credibility and accepting public humiliation in the process.\nHe became increasingly isolated in his research, pursuing his own lonely track while largely ignoring other developments in physics and particularly in quantum theory. He did pursue a few collaborations, most notably with the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, the Austrian Erwin Schrödinger and his Hungarian former student Leó Szilárd, and later in the 1930s with the Russian physicist Boris Podolsky and the Israeli physicist Nathan Rosen. But his his distrust of quantum theory and his inconclusive search for the elusive ""theory of everything"" was to consume him until the day he died.\nIn the early 1930s, Einstein took to spending his winters at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, and was also a guest lecturer at the newly founded Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. When, in 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany and promptly passed the ""Law of the Restoration of the Civil Service"" removing Jews and politically suspect government employees (including university professors) from their jobs, the Einsteins prudently moved to the U.S.A., buying a house in Princeton. The Nazis froze his German bank account and seized his home, and Einstein remained in the United States for the rest of his life, becoming a citizen in 1940 (although he also retained his Swiss citizenship). Over time, he became so well known in his adopted America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain ""that theory"".\nHis wife Elsa died in 1936, and his personal secretary, Helen Dukas, cared for him thereafter, as his health became increasingly precarious. During the 1930s and into World War II, Einstein wrote a huge number of affidavits recommending U.S. visas for European Jews who were trying to flee persecution. The “Deutsche Physik” movement in Nazi Germany published pamphlets and even textbooks denigrating Einstein, and blacklisting any instructors who taught his theories (including Nobel laureates Max Planck and Werner Heisenberg).\nWith the Nazi rise to power in Germany, Einstein decided to rethink his rigid pacifist stance. Many scientists in the U.S.A., especially refugees from European anti-Semitism, recognized the danger of German scientists developing an atomic bomb during World War II, based on the newly discovered phenomenon of nuclear fission, to which Einstein’s own theoretical work had contributed to some extent. In 1939, Einstein signed a letter to U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, penned by the Hungarian émigré and physicist Leó Szilárd, urging American development of such a weapon, and this letter is considered instrumental in Roosevelt’s subsequent authorization of secret research into the harnessing of nuclear fission for military purposes (which developed into the Manhattan Project and ultimately resulted in the nuclear weapons used on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki).\nAlthough Einstein himself did not play a direct role in the development of the atomic bomb, he later expressed regret about signing the letter to Roosevelt, and urged that all nuclear weapons be transferred into the control of the United Nations. In the later Cold War years, Einstein lobbied, along with Albert Schweitzer and Bertrand Russell, to stop all nuclear testing and future bombs.\nIn politics, he was a socialist Zionist who supported the creation of a Jewish national homeland in the British mandate of Palestine, and he raised money for Zionist organizations and was in part responsible for the 1933 formation of the International Rescue Committee. In 1952, he was even invited to be Israel\'s second president, but he declined, claiming that he had “neither the natural ability nor the experience to deal with human beings”. In a 1949 article entitled ""Why Socialism?"", Einstein described a chaotic capitalist society as the ""predatory phase of human development” and as a source of evil to be overcome. He was a member of several civil rights groups, and was sympathetic to the notion of vegetarianism, adopting a strict vegetarian diet later in life.\nAlthough many religious groups have claimed that Einstein worshipped a Judeo-Christian God, he himself was quite clear on the matter, repeatedly professing himself to be a humanist and an agnostic (although not an atheist), with no belief in a personal God, which he called a “childlike” faith. The family practised no formal religion in their home and Einstein did not want his children to receive any form of religious instruction. He did, however, admit to professing a belief in “Spinoza\'s God, who reveals Himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God who concerns Himself with the fate and the doings of mankind”, and he often expressed a continuing awe at the harmony and order of nature and the universe.\nEinstein began to suffer from ill health in 1950, and eventually died of an aortic aneurysm on 18 April 1955 in Princeton Hospital in New Jersey at the age of 76, having continued to work, both on physics and on his civil rights and political concerns, until the day he died, his search for a ""theory of everything"" still unrealized.\nBack to Top of Page\nIntroduction | Main Topics | Important Dates and Discoveries | Important Scientists | Cosmological Theories | The Universe By Numbers | Glossary of Terms | A Few Random Facts\nIf you quote this material please be courteous and provide a link.\nCitations | Sources | Questions?
