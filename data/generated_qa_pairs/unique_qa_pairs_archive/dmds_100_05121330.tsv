1	How many publishers rejected 'Desert of the Heart'?	Desert of the Heart by Jane Rule was rejected by 22 publishers before it was finally published in 1964.	['To celebrate Freedom to Read Week, we highlight censorship and dissident voices in Canadian poetry and fiction, sharing a few of Talon’s contributions to intellectual freedom.\nIn the fall of 2014, Vancouver poet Stephen Collis was served a $5.6 million dollar lawsuit for protesting and defending Burnaby Mountain against the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain oil pipeline. The Kinder Morgan lawyer used Collis’s poem as evidence against him.\nLynne Quarmby and Collis received the Nora and Ted Sterling Prize in Support of Controversy. As part of the lecture, Steve said:\nFor me personally, one of the most instructive, and chilling, moments was having my writing read aloud in the BC Supreme Court, by Kinder Morgan’s lawyers, accusing me of conspiring against their company. “Underneath the poetry,” the lawyer said of a blog I had written (and I quote), “is a description of how the barricade was made”—thereby unintentionally echoing the famous Situationist slogan: sous la plave, la plage (under the paving stones, the beach). It was a good day for poetry—it mattered enough to be cited in court—even if it was a bad day for this one poet.\nIn a poem, we can say public things we otherwise do not have the opportunity or occasion (or perhaps even freedom) to say, and we can address situations, individuals, the body politic and even abstract entities in ways that would not otherwise make sense. And yet, this imaginary by which we speak to that which it is often impossible to speak is a crucial political imaginary too. Democracy, I would argue, is nothing less than a mechanism to allow impossible speech: the collective speech of and between communities, the speech of and to large and abstract forces that affect us all in the broadest, and therefore sometimes decidedly intangible, ways. Such speech is absolutely necessary to our social wellbeing, and while “publicness” seems to be something which has been steadily eroded over the past three or four neoliberal and austerity-filled decades, poetry and other literary arts remain a place where the voice of honest indignation (as William Blake called it) is kept alive.\nRead the rest of Collis’s lecture on his blog.\nThis fall, Talon will publish Once in Blockadia, Stephen Collis’s fifth collection of poems.\nMore Canadian poetry that has previously been challenged:\nIn 1964, after 22 rejections from publishers, Jane Rule’s Desert of the Heart was finally published. It was adapted for film in 1985 as Desert Hearts. One would think Rule’s work was ready to receive acceptance from many communities, but in 1990 her novel, The Young in One Another’s Arms (first published in 1977) was temporarily seized at customs en route from the States to the Glad Day Bookshop in Toronto. Rule’s novels are now lesbian classics, and were groundbreaking for their depictions of lesbian love, questioning of heteronormativity, and criticism of societal convention.\nIn the context of routine seizures of books destined for LGBTQ bookstores, and the explosion of a bomb in the front stairwell of Little Sister’s Bookstore in 1992, Rule spoke about censorship and government policy in the documentary, Fiction and Other Truths.\nIn 2011, Talon published Taking my Life, Jane Rule’s autobiography.\n#FTRWeek: events of interest\nAcknowledgments to FreedomtoRead.ca’s list of Challenged Works.']	['<urn:uuid:f2b8a63e-65c0-426f-93e0-9941122cd57e>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	8	19	538
2	food production help climate change	Biodiverse, ecological approaches to food provision offer solutions to climate change challenges. This involves using more diverse agricultural methods that support sustainable production systems, particularly through soil biota, pollinators and predators, while also contributing to CO2 sequestration.	"['Agricultural Biodiversity, sometimes called \'Agrobiodiversity\', encompasses the variety and variability of animals, plants and micro-organisms which are necessary to sustain key functions of the agro-ecosystem, its structure and processes for, and in support of, food production and food security. Agricultural Biodiversity provides: i. Sustainable production of food and other agricultural products emphasising both strengthening sustainability in production systems at all levels of intensity and improving the conservation, sustainable use and enhancement of the diversity of all genetic resources for food and agriculture, especially plant and animal genetic resources, in all types of production systems. ii. Biological or life support to production emphasising conservation, sustainable use and enhancement of the biological resources that support sustainable production systems, particularly soil biota, pollinators and predators. iii. Ecological and social services provided by agro-ecosystems such as landscape and wildlife protection, soil protection and health (fertility, structure and function), water cycle and water quality, air quality, CO2 sequestration, etc.\nRelated categories 4\nAgricultural Biodiversity Community\nThe agricultural biodiversity community is a global network with a Secretariat in India.

3	how long did construction take frejus tunnel alps between france italy	The Fréjus Tunnel took 13 years to construct, from August 1857 to September 1871. While some believed it would take 40 years to complete, the work was greatly accelerated by new technologies such as pneumatic drilling machines and dynamite.	"['Fréjus Rail Tunnel\nThe Italian Portal of the Fréjus Rail Tunnel\n|Character||Passenger and freight|\n|No. of tracks||Two|\n|Track gauge||1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1⁄2 in)|\n|Electrified||25 kV 50 Hz AC|\nThe Fréjus Rail Tunnel (also called Mont Cenis Tunnel) is a rail tunnel of 13.7 km (8.5 mi) length in the European Alps, carrying the Turin–Modane railway through Mont Cenis to an end-on connection with the Culoz–Modane railway and linking Bardonecchia in Italy to Modane in France. Its mean altitude is 1,123 m and it passes beneath the Pointe du Fréjus (2,932 m) and the Col du Fréjus (2,542 m).\nHeaded by the Italian civil engineer Germain Sommeiller, construction of the tunnel commenced during August 1857. From the onset, the tunnel was an ambitious engineering challenge, its gallery being twice the length of any tunnel previously constructed. Some figures believed that it would take as many as 40 years to complete; the total construction time was 13 years, the work having been greatly accelerated by the introduction of new technologies such as pneumatic drilling machines and dynamite. On 17 September 1871, the Fréjus Tunnel was opened to traffic for the first time, facilitating a new era of interaction between France and Italy.\nThe Fréjus tunnel remains an important link in the connection between Rome and Paris, via Turin and Chambéry. Following the development of car and truck transportation, the Fréjus Road Tunnel was built along the same path from 1974 to 1980. During the 2000s, the Fréjus Rail Tunnel underwent a series of works to modernise and improve it, including the increase of its bore to accommodate wider rail vehicles, including container trucks on piggy-back wagons, as part of the Autoroute Ferroviaire Alpine. A future high-speed rail tunnel to improve transit capacity between France and Italy, called the Mont d\'Ambin Base Tunnel, is being planned as part of the Turin–Lyon high-speed railway project.\nThe mountains of the Alps had posed long difficulties to any movements between Italy and its neighbours. Even with the arrival of new technologies such as the railway, the task of successfully traversing these peaks was viewed by numerous figures as a fool\'s errand, unfeasible to the point of being impossible. However, there was a strong political desire amongst officials in both Italy and France to establish a railway between the two which, if completed, would launch a new era of transit and bring new commercial opportunities for both nations. In Italy, the Victor Emmanuel Railway, which included both the Culoz–Modane railway across Savoy and the Turin–Modane railway across Piedmont, was largely constructed in the 1850s by the Kingdom of Sardinia and named after its king, Victor Emmanuel II. Prior to 1860, Sardinia had included both Savoy and Piedmont.\nEven as it was being first envisioned, the Fréjus Tunnel, a necessary feature for traversing Mont Cenis, was viewed as being the primary engineering challenge of the Turin–Modane railway by far; the initial length of its gallery was 12.8 kilometres, which was twice as much as the previously longest tunnel in the world at that time. The Italian civil engineer Germain Sommeiller was appointed to head this undertaking. Considerable backing for the endeavor was forthcoming from individual Italians, not only in terms of funding, but also technical expertise, public endorsements, and labourers.\nDuring August 1857, drilling work commenced on the Bardonecchia side, activity stated on the Modane side in December 1857. It had been deemed impossible to increase the rate of excavation via intermediate shafts, thus the tunnel was driven entirely from either end. Serious challenges were encountered, including difficulty with providing sufficient ventilation. New methods of ventilation were successfully introduced, alongside other technological innovations. At the time, it was believed that, if the tunnel\'s construction had to rely upon traditional methods alone, it would have taken 40 years to complete.\nThree years following the start of the tunnel\'s construction, unanticipated political interactions led to the transfer of Savoy from Italy to France in 1860 under the Treaty of Turin; the change of borders did not majorly disrupt the rate of work on the tunnel however. The tunnel took 14 years to construct, its rate of progress having been considerable increased via the use of new technical innovations such as pneumatic drilling machines and explosive charges that used electrical ignition. In the final years of construction, the use of recently invented dynamite further accelerated progress in the tunnel. The next two Alpine tunnels were also constructed using similar techniques, these being the Gotthard Tunnel opened in 1882 and the Simplon Tunnel in 1906. On 26 December 1870, French and Italian workers shook hands as the two teams met halfway: the galleries were aligned to about 40 cm horizontally and 60 cm vertically.\nOn 17 September 1871, the Fréjus Tunnel was officially opened to traffic. One foreign newspaper covering the occasion, the Michigan Argus, described the tunnel as being ""one of the greatest, if not the greatest, engineering feat of the age"". While further major tunnels through the Alps have since been constructed , it has remained active, the Fréjus Rail Tunnel being the oldest of the large tunnels through the Alps.\nBetween 1868 and 1871, the Mont Cenis Pass Railway was briefly operational as a temporary link over the Mont Cenis Pass. It was closed shortly after the opening of the Fréjus Railway. This railway was itself described as an engineering achievement in its own right.\nAlterations and improvements\nThe original tunnel portal on the French side at Modane was only used for little over a decade before falling into disuse after having been bypassed during 1881. It was decided to redirect the tunnel to a new entrance positioned to the east of the original, where the ground was considerably more stable. The surplus portal was left in place as a monument, and has since become a minor tourist attraction. A steam locomotive has been placed in the disused portal, which is presently located adjacent to a road.\nDuring the 2000s, the Fréjus Rail Tunnel underwent a programme of works to both modernise and improve it. One specific and major alteration performed during this period was the enlargement of the bore to facilitate an equivalent loading gauge of French Lignes à grande vitesses (LGVs) throughout, thus enabling the tunnel to be traversed by wider rail vehicles, including container trucks on piggy-back wagons, as part of the Autoroute Ferroviaire Alpine. Various other enhancements were enacted, largely on the French side of the tunnel. The first package of work focused on civil works, while a follow-up package focused on electrical systems. During the former, the track was replaced and the track bed lowered, sections of masonry were repaired where applicable, new safety recesses created, along with other civil works around the tunnel\'s exterior, including a reservoir.\nFollowing the transfer of Savoy from Italy to France, the Fréjus Tunnel became a possible invasion route from Italy to France, particularly as it avoided the historical difficulties posed by the Mont Cenis pass. Accordingly, an extraordinary amount of defensive fortifications were constructed near to and around Modane. The Fort du Replaton and the Fort du Sapey were built in the late nineteenth century on the heights across the valley of the Arc. During the 1930s, the Maginot Line fortifications Ouvrage Saint-Gobain, Ouvrage Saint-Antoine and additional fortifications at Le Sappey were also constructed.\nA blockhouse along the rail line to the east of the modern tunnel entrance has become a tourist attraction. The maison penchée (""leaning house"") was built in 1939 to guard the tunnel entrance over an ammunition magazine connected to the tunnel by a gallery. During 1944, the retreating Germans deliberately exploded two rail wagons inside the tunnel entrance, causing the magazine to explode and blasting the blockhouse off its foundations, leaving it on a tilt.\n- ""The Mont Cenis Tunnel"".

5	ways remove stuck screw metal plate	There are several methods to remove stuck screws from metal plates. For basic situations, you can use a standard screwdriver. If the screw is cold-welded or jammed, you can try using specialty tools like conical extraction screws, high-speed carbide drill bits, or hollow reamers. In cases where these aren't available, you can also bend both ends of the broken plate around the stuck screw and rotate it counterclockwise to remove it manually. This manual technique is quick, inexpensive, and doesn't cause thermal damage to surrounding tissue, though it's only suitable for single screws and shouldn't be used with osteoporotic bone.	['Do enough work on automobiles or other machinery, and it’s bound to happen: the head of a bolt shears off, leaving it stuck in the assembly without straightforward means of removal.\nThis happens often enough that tools and techniques for removal are well-developed. Following the methods below, a stuck, broken bolt can be removed.\nWhen the bolt is secured by a nut:\nThis is the true “bolted joint”; a bolt or cap screw in a threaded hole is technically known as a “screw joint”.\nWhen one cannot simply slide the bolt out of the other side of the joint, it is usually much simpler to remove the nut than to hold the nut in place and remove a broken bolt. Specialty tools known as “nut splitters” drive a wedge into a nut using an hydraulic press and crack it into two or more pieces. These are widely available from Sears, Harbor Freight, Amazon.com, Snap-On, and many other tool suppliers. Follow the instructions provided by the tool manufacturer, and be sure to wear eye protection.\nIf the workspace is so tight that a nut splitter will not fit, a cutting disk in a rotary tool or die grinder can be used instead to cut away the nut. A hammer and cold chisel can sometimes also be used to break the bolt below the nut or to crack the nut. In tightest spaces, wrap electrical tape around a hacksaw blade to create a makeshift handle and cut the bolt under the nut by sawing. With no tension on the blade, this will take a long time, but it works.\nWhen the bolt is in a threaded, possibly blind hole in the assembly:\nA bolt or cap screw in a screw joint, with no corresponding nut, is considerably more difficult to remove, but a common specialty bit known as a “broken bolt extractor”, “screw extractor”, or “easy-out” makes it possible with no specialized equipment.\nThe broken bolt extractor is nearly useless on its own. Other tools needed to complete the job are a T-handle to hold the extractor, an electric drill (preferably reversible), and drill bits hard enough to make a pilot hole in the bolt to be removed (preferably left-hand drill bits). A blowtorch, a center punch and a rotary tool similar to that made by Dremel or Foredom will make the job easier.\nStep-by-step instructions are as follows:\n(1) If the bolt is hardened or otherwise difficult to drill, anneal it by heating it with the torch, to red-hot temperature if possible, and allowing it to slowly cool.\n(2) If the accessible surface of the bolt is uneven or convex, make a symmetric, concave depression in it using the rotary tool.\n(3) As accurately as possible, make a punch at the center of the broken bolt.\n(4) Using a small, hard, sharp bit, drill a pilot hole in the broken bolt.\n(5) Work your way up, one bit at a time, to a pilot hole size large enough to accommodate your extractor. Drill slowly and steadily, using cutting oil if necessary.\n(6) If you previously annealed the bolt, now harden it by heating it to red-hot and quickly quenching it with water.\n(7) Using the T-handle (not the power drill!) screw the extractor into the pilot hole.\n(8) With steady torque and no impact whatsoever, twist the broken bolt out of its hole using the T-handle and extractor.\n(9) If necessary, clean up the outer threads in the workpiece using a tap, or repair them with a helicoil kit or plastic thread repair compound.\nSome extractors on the market are designed for use with power drills. The procedure is similar, but follow the package instructions instead of using a T-handle.\nAlden Tool now sells a “Drill-Out” broken bolt extractor kit, claiming that it is self-centering and allows bolts to be extracted using a single tool which first drills a pilot hole, then is adjusted to engage the broken bolt. Follow directions on the package. Centering these new “drill-out” extractors depends strongly on matching the size of the bolt; be sure to use the correct size for your application. I have no direct experience with this product; your success may vary.\nIf a portion of the bolt protrudes from the assembly:\nTry Vise-Grips or similar locking pliers. If that does not work, plug weld a nut to the protruding end of the bolt and use penetrating lubricant, a socket and a breaker bar for removal.\nIf the bolt is iron or steel and the housing or assembly is aluminum:\nA steel or iron bolt in an aluminum housing is particularly easy to remove by chemical means, provided that the assembly can be immersed in a bucket or tub, preferably one that can be heated.\nDissolve a quarter cup of aluminum alum in water and immerse the part. Heat to just below boiling if possible, otherwise, wait several days. The ferrous metal will be corroded by the alum solution, but the aluminum will be left intact.\nIf all else fails:\nLook in the telephone book for machine shops that can remove broken drill bits or taps. Any shop that can remove a tap (a difficult task!) can remove a bolt. If these services aren’t explicitly advertised, look for “electrical discharge machining” or EDM. Often this can be done with no damage to the threads. If this service is not available in your area, search the Web, as quite a few shops are advertising services on shipped parts or assemblies.\nThese services can also remove stuck or broken “easy-out” broken bolt extractors, which are as hard as taps and cannot be drilled, although they can sometimes be ground out with a small diamond burr in a Dremel or similar rotary tool. Before using a broken bolt extractor, keep in mind that sending the part off to an EDM shop is “plan B”.\nTo avoid breaking bolts:\nAs the old saying goes: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\nWhere there is little to no threat of a fastener “backing out” due to torque and vibration, apply a thin coating of nickel colloid “anti-seize” lubricant to the threads prior to assembly, especially for screw joints in which the screws are different material than the outer threads, e.g. steel cap screws in an aluminum engine block. Where this is not appropriate, use a thread-locking compound such as Loctite to keep moisture out of the threads.\nTreat hardened bolts like drill bits or taps; avoid impact. When designing a piece of equipment, be sure that stresses on bolts are within specification. Tensile strength of bolts of given diameters and grades are well-tabulated and available from most fastener suppliers. Shear strength is not as often reported. A common “rule of thumb” is that shear strength is 0.6 times the tensile strength.\nMost importantly, ensure that all joints are properly tightened, never re-use a fastener that has been heated with a blowtorch, and be sure that all replacement fasteners are of correct grade for the application.', '|Year : 2018 | Volume\n| Issue : 2 | Page : 142-144\nTechnique for the removal of a locking screw from a broken locking plate following cold welding\nAlok Chandra Agrawal, Mangesh Mahadeo Chandewar, Rahul Kumar Chandan\nDepartment of Orthopaedics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Raipur, Chhattisgarh, India\n|Date of Web Publication||22-Nov-2018|\nDr. Mangesh Mahadeo Chandewar\nDepartment of Orthopaedics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Raipur, Chhattisgarh\nSource of Support: None, Conflict of Interest: None\nThe advent of locking plates has brought new problems in implant removal.

Difficulty in removing screws from a locking plate is well known. These difficulties include cold welding between the screw head and locking screw hole, stripping of the recess of the screw head for the screwdriver, and cross-threading between threads in the screw head and screw hole., Several reports described risks, tips, and techniques to remove these locking plates., These include using a conical extraction screw, cutting the plate, using high-speed carbide drill bits and burrs to remove the screw heads, and removing the shanks with conical extraction screws. However, there are cases in which removal is extremely difficult if an instrument set for round screw removal is not available. We described a technique which allowed us to easily remove such round-headed, cold-welded jammed screw with simple instruments at hand and complete the prescribed operation smoothly [Figure 1] and [Figure 2].\n|Figure 1: Preoperative X-ray showing broken clavicle locking plate with clavicle nonunion|\nClick here to view\n| Case Report|| |\nA 32-year-old female patient reported to us with broken clavicle plate, who was operated 3 years back from outside for fracture clavicle right side.

X-ray was suggestive of broken implant with nonunion of clavicle. The patient consented to implant removal, freshening of edges, and fixation with anatomical clavicle plate with bone grafting, with the express understanding that implant removal might be impossible. All the screws are removed with standard screw driver except the second screw of medial broken plate which was jammed and round headed. The carbide drill was not available at that time. We bent both ends of broken medial plate around screw and removed screw by just rotating bent plate anticlockwise. Fracture ends were freshened and fixation was done with anatomical clavicle locking plate and bone grafting. At the end of the procedure, surgical wound was washed thoroughly with normal saline [Figure 3], [Figure 4], [Figure 5], [Figure 6].\n|Figure 3: Removal of bent plate with jammed, round-headed screw manually|\nClick here to view\n|Figure 4: Postoperative picture of removed broken plate with jammed, round-headed screw in plate|\nClick here to view\n|Figure 5: Intraoperative picture showing fixation with clavicle locking plate|\nClick here to view\n|Figure 6: Postoperative X-ray showing fixation with clavicle locking plate and bone grafting|\nClick here to view\n| Discussion|| |\nImplant removal following broken implant in clavicle fracture is considered for pain related to metalwork, impingement, nerve injury, and patient-requested implant removal. Removing implants is often more difficult than the index operation to insert the implant. Risks of implant removal include wound-healing problems, soft-tissue injury, and neurovascular injury, failure to remove all of the implant, and refracture. Difficulties in removing a titanium locking screw include jammed screws, damage to the recess in the screw head (stripping) for the screwdriver, and broken screws. Tips, techniques, and pitfalls of implant removal are well described. Instruments including conical extraction screws, hollow reamers, extraction bolts, modular devices, and carbide drill bits have been described in the methods used for removing locking screws., The generally accepted reason for titanium locking screws getting jammed in the threaded screw holes is cold welding of the screw head in the threads of the locking screw holes., We believe failure to remove the screws directly with the conical extraction screw was attributable to the following factors: (1) jamming of the screw head in the locking screw hole, owing to cross-threading and not necessarily cold welding, (2) grip of the screw threads in the far cortex, (3) bony growth over the titanium screw at the far cortex, and (4) as the conical extraction screw was inserted, the screw head jammed farther in the screw hole by expanding the screw head. Risk of cold welding in titanium plates and screws should be low if the screws have been inserted in an orthogonal fashion to the plate with a torque-limiting screwdriver. Even if a cold weld spot was present, our technique is less destructive when compared with cutting the whole plate or screw and over drilling the screws. A locking screw that cannot be removed with a torque-limiting screw is technically jammed whether it is attributable to cold welding or cross-threading or just overtightened. Bony overgrowth is a substantial problem in titanium implants., There is always the danger of thermal bone necrosis or iatrogenic bony injury when using high-speed burrs. However, our technique is less destructive as it produces very less heat as compared to other techniques because it is not mechanical but a manual procedure. It is essential to have all the appropriate implant removal instruments, including carbide drill bits and high-speed burrs, and prepare for a long procedure. A conical extraction screw is not always successful in removing the jammed screw. The risks of high-speed burrs are high local temperature and metal debris. As with any problem, prevention is the best treatment. All precautions should be taken to ensure that the locking screws are inserted perpendicular to the plate without cross-threading using a torque-limiting screw driver. The problem of screw head jamming is not seen with stainless steel screws. Osteoporotic bone is a limitation of the above method as the bone is weak and may break while bending the plate and is possible only with a single locking screw.\n| Conclusion|| |\nThis technique is very quick, easy to perform, and inexpensive without the use of plate cutting blade, burr, hollow reamer, and other instrumentation. It is very effective technique to remove the stripped headed, cold-welded jammed locking screws. It is also very less destructive because of no heat production during the procedure. There is no problem of thermal necrosis to the bone or the surrounding soft tissue. It is an inexpensive and effective method for the removal of such implants, which are extremely difficult because of round-headed cold welding and jammed locking screw heads.\nDeclaration of patient consent\nThe authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

6	radioactive gas reduce protection methods house	According to current data, radon gas causes about 21,000 lung cancer deaths annually in the U.S. To protect against radon, the most effective method is active sub-slab depressurization, which involves installing a pipe through the foundation floor slab with a continuously running fan that draws radon from below the home and releases it outdoors. This system typically costs $2,000-$3,000 for installation plus about $50-75 annually for electricity. The system should be maintained regularly by checking the manometer (pressure gauge) and ensuring the fan runs continuously. For new homes, preventive measures can be taken during construction, including installing sealed plastic membranes under the foundation and rough-in pipes for future radon reduction systems if needed.	['By Philip Jalbert, Environmental Protection Agency\nWould you live in a home that was not safe and secure? To be marketable, multifamily housing needs to be both. Moreover, to be safe and to feel secure, a home needs to be healthy. A healthy indoor environment is as attractive to tenants and homebuyers as is a safe and secure one.\nWe spend an average of 90 percent of our time indoors. Each year there are tens of thousands of deaths and millions of illnesses because of poor indoor air quality. Billions of dollars are spent every year on health care related to poor indoor air quality (IAQ), and the loss of school days and business productivity is enormous.\nSome of the most common and serious indoor air quality issues are caused by: too much moisture—leading to mold and mildew; poorly maintained or operated combustion appliances that emit carbon monoxide (CO), nitrous oxide (NO) and particulates; volatile and semi-volatile organic chemicals (VOCs, SVOCs) from building materials and finishings; radon gas seeping into the home from soil under the home; and secondhand smoke. (Readers can find IAQ information and free\nAcceptable indoor air quality (IAQ) and occupant health depend on many factors, such as: occupant behavior and practices (smoking, cleaning, cooking and home maintenance practices); proper building siting, design and construction; proper ventilation; and control of furnishings and other products and sources that emit hazardous pollutants indoors.\nIndoor Air Quality is a particular concern in multifamily buildings. While indoor air quality is a potential concern in all types of housing, in multifamily buildings pollutants can move from unit to unit, and into common areas through openings in walls and ceilings, and through shared ventilation systems. Isolating individual units—often called “compartmentalization”—is sometimes needed to address IAQ issues in multifamily buildings.\nHow can you prevent exposure to second-hand smoke?\nSmoking is an important occupant behavior not only for the person who smokes, but also for those who share the indoor space. In fact, when it comes to multifamily housing, depending on the degree of air sealing and design of a building’s heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, secondhand smoke can adversely affect non-smoking occupants in neighboring units. An estimated 3,000 Americans die each year from lung cancer due to exposure to secondhand smoke or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Secondhand smoke is also a significant asthma trigger and causes other important health problems, particularly in children.\nThe two main strategies for preventing exposure to secondhand smoke in multifamily buildings are to prohibit smoking in the building entirely, or seal individual units where smoke-free policies are not currently in place. About 10 percent of public housing is now smoke-free.\nThe Departments of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Health and Human Services (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently developed two smoke-free toolkits for multifamily housing. The toolkits are for residents, and public housing authorities and owners/management agents.\nHUD also issued two smoke-free notices: HUD Public and Indian Housing Smoke-Free Notice (PIH-2012-25, May 29, 2012); and, HUD Notice on Smoke-Free Housing (H 2012-22, October 26, 2012). On October 4, 20102, HUD also published a Request for Information on smoke-free in the Federal Register.\nIs radioactive radon soil gas an issue?\nEPA’s current risk assessment estimates that exposure to radon in U.S. homes is responsible for 21,000 or 13.4 percent of all lung cancer deaths each year. The risk is highest among smokers. When combined with exposure to radon, smokers’ risk of radon-induced lung cancer increases about ten times.\nMore and more builders of multifamily housing are including radon-reducing features in new homes. In its 2011 annual survey of builder practices, the National Association of Home Builder’s Home Innovation Research Labs estimated that of the 223,400 multifamily housing starts:\n• 19.4 percent included radon-reducing features, up from 15.3 percent in 2010; and\n• 29.5 percent included radon-reducing features in the highest radon potential areas (Zone 1), up from 18.9 percent in 2010.\nRadon source control measures such as active sub-slab soil depressurization (ASD) have other applications and potential benefits. A limited EPA funded study of Pennsylvania residences found that ASD systems can reduce indoor humidity and moisture levels during the non-summer months of the year. ASD systems are also used to manage soil gases and vapor intrusion. The American Association of Radon Scientists and Technologists (AARST) is consulting with EPA to develop a vapor intrusion mitigation credential as an add-on to the AARST-National Radon Proficiency program’s mitigation credential. www.aarst.org/\nWhat’s the federal government doing about radon?\nThe Federal Radon Action Plan is a continuing Federal initiative. One result of the Plan is HUD adopting an unprecedented radon policy for multifamily housing (see above). HUD and EPA are two of nine Federal agencies participating in the Federal Radon Action Plan. The Plan works to reduce the radon risk in housing and schools owned, managed or financed by the Federal Government. The expectation is that Federal leadership by example will spur more private sector action on radon risk reduction.\nAdditionally HUD announced two new notices regarding radon:\n• Office of Multifamily Development, Notice H 2013-03 (Jan. 31, 2013); and,\n• Office of Public and Indian Housing, Notice PIH 2013-06 HA (Feb. 4, 2013).\nThe Multifamily Notice supplements the environmental review process and requirements for the identification and mitigation of radon in new FHA-insured mortgage applications. The Public and Indian Housing notice encourages Public Housing Authorities to plan and complete radon testing and mitigation when appropriate.\nDo energy retrofits affect IAQ?\nMore than ever before American homes are being upgraded or remodeled. This trend is likely to increase in the future as efforts to improve building energy efficiency continue. The benefits of energy upgrades are tremendous—improved real property value, lower costs and sustained American jobs. However, energy upgrades can inadvertently worsen indoor air quality. This is true when there is not an appropriate assessment made before work begins or if work is done improperly.\nTo help guide upgrade activities, the Department of Energy (DOE) developed Guidelines for Home Energy Professionals. Working in concert with DOE, EPA\ndeveloped the Healthy Indoor Environment Protocols for Home Energy Upgrades—\nto complement the Guidelines. The Protocols apply to existing single-family and multifamily low-rise residential buildings.\nThe pollutants to be concerned about are: asbestos, VOCs, moisture, CO, ETS, ozone, NO, lead, PCBs, radon, combustion emissions, and below ground contaminants.\nThe Protocols provide detailed guidance on assessment, and minimum and expanded actions to remedy problems for each of the pollutants. The protocols provide practical guidance on improving or maintaining indoor air quality and indoor environments during home energy upgrades or remodeling.\nAnother valuable resource when rehabbing occupied buildings is the IAQ Guidelines for Occupied Buildings under Construction, 2nd Edition (ANSI/SMACNA 008–2008), produced by the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors’ National Association.\nCan climate change affect IAQ?\nA recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) study found that climate change is likely to make existing indoor air quality problems more widespread and severe. The IOM, part of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), evaluated the state of scientific understanding of the effects of climate change on indoor air quality and public health.\nPhilip Jalbert is executive secretary with the Federal Interagency Committee on Indoor Air Quality at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Indoor Environments Division.', 'Mitigation methods to lower Radon levels.\nActive Soil Depressurization\nActive Sub-Slab Depressurization\nSub-slab depressurization (also called active soil depressurization) is the most effective and reliable radon reduction technique. It is also the most common method used by C-NRPP certified professionals.\nExamples of venting options for active sub-slab depressurization\nThis method involves installing a pipe through the foundation floor slab and attaching a fan that runs continuously to draw the radon gas from below the home and release it into the outdoors where it is quickly diluted. This system also reverses the air pressure difference between the house and soil, reducing the amount of radon that is drawn into the home through the foundation. One, or sometimes multiple, suction points are inserted through the floor slab into the crushed rock or soil underneath to effectively reduce the radon level in the home.\nThe sub-slab depressurization pipe can be vented at either the roof level or ground level of the home. The fan can be placed in the basement or an area outside of the living space such as in a garage or attic. If the fan is placed inside the living space of the home, it is usually vented sideways through the rim joist at ground level, with the fan close to the exhaust location. When the fan is placed outside of the living space (e.g. attic or garage) then it is typically vented upwards above the roof.\nIn many Canadian climates, a fan and pipe located outside the living space (garage or attic) will cool during the colder months of the year, leading to condensation and possibly ice, which can damage the fan and affect the effectiveness of the radon-reduction system.\nCondensation problems can be reduced if the fan is placed indoors and the exhaust is discharged from a shorter pipe near ground level at right angles to the wall, much like the power vented exhausts from combustion appliances such as natural gas-fired water heaters.\nIf the fan is placed inside the home, it is important to confirm with your contractor that it is air tight and that all pipes and plumbing joints have been sealed. Properly installed fans and pipes will not leak radon into the building and are usually installed in the basement. When the fan and pipe are placed inside the home and combined with a ground level discharge, almost the entire system is located indoors, which helps to avoid problems that can arise from cold climates.\nCurrent field test studies of indoor mounted fans with near ground level discharges show this is an effective technique. Further field testing of this system in urban environments where houses are built in close proximity to each other is necessary. To verify continued performance of any radon-reduction system, an initial long-term measurement should be made within two years of the system activation and at five-year intervals afterwards.\nWhen any active depressurization system is installed, it is recommended to make sure that its operation does not cause backdrafting of combustion appliances such as a furnace, water heater, fireplace, or wood stove in the home. Backdrafting can happen when a room with a combustion appliance is depressurized so much that smoke and combustion gases spill into the home instead of venting outdoors. Backdraft testing may be done by a trained radon-reduction specialist or a heating contractor.\nA variation of active sub-slab depressurization is active sump-hole depressurization. Often, when a home with a basement has a sump pump to remove unwanted water, the sump can be capped and sealed so that it can continue to drain water and also serve as the location for a radon suction pipe. If a basement floor drain is connected to the sump, a mechanical trap seal device or water trap should be installed to prevent house air from entering the sump via the drain.\nDrainage System Depressurization\nSome homes have drain tiles or perforated pipe to direct water away from the foundation of the home. Suction on these tiles or pipes can be effective in reducing radon levels, especially for a block wall foundation. This method, called drainage system depressurization, is worth considering if it is certain the tile forms a complete loop around the foundation. This type of system will be less effective if only a small area of the basement perimeter is covered.\nHomes with Crawlspaces: Active Sub-Membrane Depressurization\nThe soil in a crawlspace can be vented using a similar technique called active sub-membrane depressurization. It involves laying a thick plastic sheet (often a polyethylene membrane) over the soil, sealing the air-tight membrane to the foundation walls and placing a pipe with fan through it to draw the radon from under the plastic sheet and vent it to the outdoors. For this method to be effective, special attention is needed to seal around the pipe where it penetrates the plastic sheet.\nSub-slab or sub-membrane depressurization systems range in cost from about $2,000 to $3,000 including material and labour. There is also a small operating cost for electricity for the fan, approximately $50 to $75 a year, depending on size of fan and energy rates.\nWhen large radon reductions (50 per cent or more) are desired, active soil depressurization is almost always the recommended approach. If smaller reductions are sufficient, the other radon reduction methods described below may be reasonable alternatives. A certified radon professional can help you determine the best solution for your home.\nOther Radon Reduction Methods\nSealing Major Entry Routes for Radon\nSealing off openings in a home where radon could be entering may help to lower radon levels in your home. However, because it is difficult to identify, access and permanently seal all openings it is not a standalone technique for reducing radon levels.\nMajor openings that can be important to seal include:\nFloor drains – Trap for floor drains that allow water to drain but prevent radon from entering the basement\nFloor Wall Joint\nFigure 3 – Sealing foundation wall and basement floor joint\nVoids in concrete block walls\nFigure 4 – Sealing voids in the top of concrete block walls\nAfter closing major openings, a further reduction in radon levels can sometimes be achieved by sealing minor entry routes that are visible or accessible. Minor cracks in foundation walls and floors can be sealed. Larger cracks require special techniques; consult your building material supplier or a contractor. The gap around utility penetrations (e.g., water, sewer, electrical, natural gas, fuel oil) in walls and floors can also be sealed.\nFigure 5 – Sealing foundation wall and floor cracks\nSealing cracks and other openings in the foundation is a basic part of most approaches to radon reduction and can help increase their effectiveness. Proper preparation of the surface area to be sealed is extremely important to create an effective and long lasting seal.\nThe cost of sealing entry routes is highly variable. It can range from a few hundred dollars to $2,000 or more. Although the material cost is relatively low, it is very labour-intensive to do a comprehensive job. As the house ages and settles, the seals can deteriorate, and new cracks or entry routes can appear. As a result, there will be an ongoing cost to maintain the seals.\nIncreasing Mechanical Ventilation of the Home\nA heat recovery ventilator (HRV) or energy recovery ventilator (ERV) can be installed to increase ventilation, which will help reduce the radon levels in your home. An HRV increases ventilation by introducing outdoor air as it uses the heated or cooled air being exhausted to warm or cool the incoming air. It is important to ensure that this type of system has balanced intake and exhaust air flows so that the house is not depressurized, which can draw in more radon.\nThe effectiveness of ventilation for radon reduction is limited and only appropriate for situations where only modest reductions are needed. In general, increased ventilation methods for radon reduction will be most successful in houses that are more airtight and have low natural ventilation rates (are not ‘drafty’). It is also important that the HRVs are properly balanced and maintained (i.e. check filters). In most homes, an HRV might reduce radon levels by 25 to 50 per cent.\nAn HRV will cost between $1,500 and $3,500 (material and labour). There is also an operating cost for electricity for the HRV’s fans as well as an increase in heating and cooling costs due to greater ventilation of the home.\n|Foundation Type||Poured Concrete||Slab-on-grade|\n|Foundation Floor||Exposed soil/ pavers||Concrete slab||Exposed soil (building extension)||Concrete slab|\nTable 1 footnotes\nCaution – Back-drafting of combustion appliances possible. e.g. Wood stove, oil/gas furnace, oil/gas water heater.\n|Close large openings to soil in any accessible parts of foundation walls/floor||Yes||Yes||No||Yes|\n|Trap floor drains that lead to soil||Yes||Yes||No||Yes|\n|Cover soil water drain sump and exhaust it to outside||Yes||Yes||No||Yes|\n|Isolate foundation area from living area.

The contractor should place a label on the system listing when it was activated, and the suggested re-test intervals. The suction and flow in the piping should be measured and noted on the label for comparison when the system fan is serviced.\nIt is recommended that a certified C-NRPP professional carry out a short-term test after a system is activated to demonstrate that it is working effectively. The test should be started at least 24 hours after the fan is turned on. The radon test should ideally be in the same location where the measurements were originally made.\nThe homeowner should also ensure that a long-term three-month test is performed the following fall /winter season to confirm that the annual average radon level has been reduced to below the Canadian guideline. To avoid conflict of interest, the test should not be performed by the company that installed the radon mitigation system.\nChange in Radon Concentration after Mitigation\nPreventing Radon Problems in New Homes\nIt is not possible to predict before construction whether or not a new home will have high radon levels. Fortunately, preventive measures can be taken by your builder during the design and construction process to reduce the amount of radon that gets into the home and make it easier to install a radon reduction system, if required.\nThe 2010 National Building Code (NBC) includes requirements that address radon. Parts five and six of the code require that engineers and designers consider radon protection in their designs and ensure control of air leakage and soil gas entry to minimize the level of radon entering a home through the foundation.\nPart nine of the code includes consolidating air barrier requirements such as a sealed plastic membrane under the foundation slab, and requiring that every building have granular fill under the slab and a rough-in for a future radon reduction system, should the need for radon reduction later arise.\nMany provinces have adopted or are in the process of adopting these 2010 National Building Codes. Homeowners should ask their builders if they include building practices that help reduce radon entry (sealed membrane) and make it easier for radon removal (rough-in for a radon reduction system) if necessary.\nBuilders can minimize radon entry into the home by:\n- Installing a sealed plastic (polyethylene) membrane under the foundation floor slab or on top of exposed soil in crawl spaces. The membrane should be a minimum of 6 mil thick with taped seams. Research in other countries, such as the United Kingdom and United States, indicate that thicker membranes can be more effective at reducing radon entry.\n- Sealing the basement floor/foundation wall expansion joint. There are several options for sealing this potential radon entry point Note that proper preparation of surfaces to be caulked is critical to obtain an effective, long-lasting seal. (see figure 3, page 21)\n- Sealing around all objects that penetrate foundation walls and basement floors, including utility lines for water, sewer, electrical, natural gas, or fuel oil. The centre of hollow objects that penetrate the walls or floors (e.g., metal support posts or masonry for fireplaces) should also be sealed or blocked.\n- Providing proper curing conditions. Moistening the slab or coating it with a special compound during curing will result in stronger, more durable concrete. If the weather is hot and dry or below freezing, your contractor must take appropriate precautions to ensure the cement is cured properly.\n- Using control joints in the concrete floor slab. While some cracks in the basement slab may be unavoidable, your contractor can direct cracks into controlled locations where they can be sealed.\n- Installing special traps in floor drains that allow water to drain but prevent radon from entering the basement (see floor drain image on page 20).\n- Using a sealed lid on the sump. Your builder may either purchase a sealed unit or field fabricate a sealed lid (See open sump image on page 20).\nThe actions mentioned on the previous page can help reduce the amount of radon that enters a home but do not guarantee that annual average radon levels will be below the Canadian guideline of 200 Bq/m³. Therefore, in addition, your builder should install a rough-in for a radon sub-slab depressurization system. It is more practical and less expensive to install the pipe through the foundation slab while your new home is being constructed.\nFigure 6 – Example of a rough-in installation for a radon sub-slab depressurization system\nThe steps that should be followed to properly install this rough-in and maximize its effectiveness include:\n- Before pouring the slab, ensuring that the entire sub-slab area is filled with at least 100 mm (4 in.) of coarse gravel to allow for good air flow/movement under the slab.\n- Installing a plastic membrane (polyethylene) air barrier under the foundation slab. The membrane should be a minimum of 6 mil in thickness with taped seams.\n- Ensure that all penetrations through the slab (plumbing, electrical, teleposts) are well sealed.\n- Casting a short length of PVC pipe of at least 100 mm (4 in.) diameter vertically through the floor slab. If the top end of the pipe is placed away from the centre of the foundation slab, a longer run of PVC pipe will need to be placed horizontally in the coarse gravel and all joints in the pipes should be sealed. The pipe protruding from the foundation slab should be capped and sealed properly to avoid radon entry from the sub-slab area. It should also labelled clearly that it is intended for a radon reduction system.\nMaintaining Your Radon Reduction System\nAs with a furnace or air conditioner, radon reduction systems need occasional maintenance. If you have a fan-powered depressurization system, you should look at your system performance-indicating device, usually a manometer, on a regular basis to make sure the system is working correctly. A U-tube manometer is used as an indicator that the mitigation system is working. The manometer is filled with a liquid and indicates pressure or flow.\nFigure 7 – U-tube manometer\nThis image shows two U-tube manometers. One U-tube manometer shows the level on both sides of the U-tube is the same, indicating that the mitigation system is not working properly. The other U-tube manometer shows a higher level on one side of the U-tube, indicating a pressure difference, which confirms that the system is working properly. Minor variations in the level can be expected. The level in the manometer should be checked from time to time. Ask your certified radon reduction expert to show you how to check if the fan is working properly and follow the instructions that are supplied with the U-tube manometer.\nRemember, the fan should NEVER be turned off; it must run continuously for the system to work properly. The lifespan of a fan can vary between five to ten or more years. Replacement cost ranges between $200 and $300.\nThe filter in a Heat Recovery Ventilator (HRV) requires periodic cleaning and should be changed twice a year. Replacement filters for an HRV are easy to change and reasonably priced. Ventilation systems should be checked annually by a heating, ventilating and air conditioning professional to make sure the air flow remains properly balanced. HRVs used for radon control should run all the time. Also, vents that bring outdoor air into the home must be inspected regularly for leaves and other debris.\nRemodelling Your Home after Radon Levels Have Been Lowered\nIf you decide to make major structural changes to your home, including, for example, converting an unfinished basement area into living space or a creating a new foundation for an addition after you have had a radon reduction system installed, ask your radon contractor what should be done to help ensure that radon levels throughout the home continue to be reduced. After you remodel, retest in the least lived-in area to make sure the construction did not reduce the effectiveness of the radon reduction system.']	['<urn:uuid:dddb494d-276e-473c-ab00-56382a7039df>', '<urn:uuid:ae6fa363-9d32-48a0-a39d-5b33e355d089>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	6	113	4106

J. William Harbour and Anne M. Bowcock\nUveal melanomas can be divided into prognostically significant subgroups based on their transcriptomic signature. Class 1 tumors rarely metastasize, and they tend be less invasive, more differentiated and occur in younger individuals than class 2 tumors1. In contrast, class 2 tumors frequently metastasize, and they tend to comprise undifferentiated “epithelioid” tumor cells lacking a copy of chromosome 31.\nWe recently described loss of function mutations in BAP1 (BRCA1-associated protein 1), located at chromosome 3p21.1, in ∼40% of uveal melanomas, virtually all of which were the aggressive class 2 tumors2. In the present study, we searched for additional mutations in uveal melanoma by exome sequencing of 18 primary tumors, including seven class 1 and eleven class 2 tumors. Exome data were filtered down to somatic alterations that were predicted to be deleterious (Supplementary Methods). Only two genes were found to harbor deleterious somatic variants in at least three tumor samples: guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(q) subunit alpha (GNAQ), which is already known to undergo mutation in uveal melanoma3,4, and splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1). In the case of SF3B1, the mutation in all three tumors led to a p.R625C alteration (hg19 chr2:198267484G>A) which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\nWe manually examined the entire SF3B1 coding sequence from the other 15 exome samples, but we did not find mutations at any sites other than R625. SF3B1 mutations were recently described in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), clustering within exons 12 to 155,6. Thus, we re-sequenced these exons in a total of 102 primary uveal melanomas and matching blood DNA samples and identified SF3B1 mutations in 19 (18.6%) tumors (Supplementary Table 1). This frequency is similar to that in MDS and CLL5,6, and much higher than that recently reported in breast cancer7. Strikingly, all of the mutations in uveal melanoma occurred atarginine-625, including twelve R625H, five R625C, one R625G and one R625L substitutions (Supplementary Fig. 1). Interestingly, R625 is one of many sites in SF3B1 that are mutated in MDS, but it is the only site that was identified as deleterious by the SIFT algorithm5, which predicts the effect an amino acid substitution has on protein function. SF3B1 mutations were not present in matching blood DNA samples, indicating that they were somatic in origin. In each of the tumors with SF3B1 mutations, wildtype and mutant alleles were present in roughly equal proportions (Supplementary Fig. 1). An evaluation of DNA copy number in 30 of the uveal melanomas, including seven with SF3B1 mutations, revealed no loss of chromosome 2q33.1 where SF3B1 resides (Supplementary Fig. 2),which would have been consistent with a classical tumor suppressor. Rather, these findings are more consistent with SF3B1 mutations functioning as dominant-negative, gain-of-function or haploinsufficient alteration.\nSF3B1 mutations were associated with favorable prognostic features such as younger patient age (P=0.03) and fewer undifferentiated epithelioid cells (P=0.003), and they were inversely associated with poor prognostic features such as the class 2 transcriptomic signature (P = 0.02), loss of chromosome 3 (P = 0.001) and mutation of BAP1 (P=0.002) (Table 1). Patients with SF3B1-mutant tumors trended toward a lower metastatic rate than those with SF3B1-wildtype tumors (P=0.1), which was in striking contrast to the high metastatic rate in patients with BAP1 mutations (P<0.0001)(Fig. 1). Five uveal melanoma samples from distant metastases were available for testing, and none harbored SF3B1 mutations, further supporting the notion that these mutations might be associated with less aggressive tumors. Taken together, these findings indicate that SF3B1 mutations are associated with better prognosis in uveal melanoma, which is similar to findings in MDS5.\nSF3B1 is one of very few genes that are commonly mutated in uveal melanoma, allowing for a more precise molecular taxonomy of this cancer. Activating oncogenic mutations in GNAQ or GNA11 occur in about 85% of primary uveal melanomas and are thought to represent early events because they are found in uveal melanomas of all stages, including pre-malignant nevi, and they are not associated with prognosis3,8. Consistent with this idea, GNAQ/GNA11 mutations were present in most of our SF3B1-mutant and BAP1-mutant tumors, suggesting that they arise earlier than SF3B1 and BAP1 mutations. In contrast, SF3B1 and BAP1 mutations were almost mutually exclusive, suggesting that they may represent alternative pathways in tumor progression.\nSF3B1 encodes subunit 1 of the splicing factor 3b protein complex, which is a component of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex (snRNP) that participates in the splicing of pre-mRNAs9. Splicing factor 3b is also a component of the minor U12-type spliceosome9. To explore the effects of mutant SF3B1 on global RNA expression, we analyzed five SF3B1-mutant and six SF3B1-wildtype class 1 tumors for differentially expressed transcripts using the Illumina Bead Array platform. This analysis was limited to class 1 tumors because most SF3B1 mutations occurred in this subset. Surprisingly, there were only 10 differentially expressed genes, and they provided no insights into the functional significance of the SF3B1 mutations (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, none of these genes were the same as those that were differentially expressed in MDS5,10. We therefore investigated if the main consequence of SF3B1 mutations was intron retention rather than differential expression. Three SF3B1-mutant and five SF3B1-wildtype class 1 tumors were analyzed for alterations in splice donor and splice acceptor retention using RNA-Seq (Supplementary Methods). However, no differences in global splice donor or acceptor retention were found between SF3B1-mutant and –wildtype tumors (data not shown). Further, we manually analyzed a set of neural crest regulatory transcripts that are aberrantly spliced in sf3b1-mutant zebrafish (SNAI1, SOX9, TFAP2A, SOX10, ID2, MITF and SF3B1)11, but no splicing abnormalities were found. Despite the known role of SF3B1 in RNA splicing, there have not been consistent results linking SF3B1 mutations to specific splicing errors in MDS or CLL, and the functional consequences of SF3B1 mutations remain elusive despite intensive investigation12. Recent links between SF3B1 and chromatin remodelling complexes13 raise the question of whether the primary effect of SF3B1 mutations on tumor progression involve RNA processing at all. Further investigations are under way to elucidate the effects of SF3B1 mutations on uveal melanoma progression in order to therapeutically target these effects.\nGene expression micro array and array CGH data have been deposited at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (accession numbers GSE39717 and GSE42740, respectively).

8	Which grape varieties are shared between French Champagne and Napa sparkling wines?	Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier, and Chardonnay are the main grape varieties used in both French Champagne and Napa Valley sparkling wines. In Champagne, Chardonnay provides finesse and citrus flavors, Pinot Noir adds fruitiness and ages well, and Pinot Meunier contributes immediate fruitiness. These same varieties are used by Napa producers like Domaine Carneros and Domaine Chandon to create their sparkling wines.	"['The different types of Champagne...\n© CICV S.T.\n...and how to read the labels\nThe categories of Champagne\nThe following are the six categories of Champagne, that are mentioned on the labels. The order in which they appear is not by order of the quality.\nVintage Year Champagne (Millésimé)\nEvery year can not be a vintage year. A vintage wine is special because it means that the year was a good year, even exceptional in terms of grapes and harvest. As usually Champagne is made by blending crus from different years, a vintage champagne is made of exclusively the year\'s harvest, and is matured at least 3 years before being reaching the market.\n(Cuvée de prestige)\nIt is the \'top\' of the champagne producing house. It may or may not be vintage.\nThese vintages represent around 1% of the French consumption.\nLes caves © Ph. Praliaud / CDT Aube\nMade only with white grapes (pure Chardonnay), it may also be called just Chardonnay. This gives a light, fresh wine in which in which are detectable the typical aromas of this grape variety, such as the grapefruit for example.\nMade by the red grape types (Pinot noir or Pinot Meunier), the Blanc-de-noirs are strong, complex and structured wines.\nBrut (no year)\nThis is the blending of different grape varieties, different years and different vineyards. It is by far the largest production of Champagne types. The Champagne is matured for at least 15 months on the wooden panels before it is put up for sale.\nVery often the quality of the house is judged by the quality of this ""basic"" Champagne.\nThis Champagne is usually mixed with a still red Champagne wine to obtain the required shade. This is a difficult operation as the red wine should not change the initial character of the cuvée. Another method used is by crushing the grapes followed by a maceration of the juice in contact with the skins of the grapes before pressing the grapes. This leads to the coloring and the flavor of a pink wine.\nThe vintages of Champagne\nAlthough 250 wine-growing towns participate in the production of Champagne, there are only 17 grands crus (vintages).\nIndicated in small capital letters at the bottom of the label.\nN. M. : Négociant-Manipulant.\nHe makes or produces the wine. A brand of a négociant indicates a négociant-manipulant. M.

R. : Société de Récoltants.\nIt is a wine producers association.\nChampagne boasts three grape varieties, and single-variety Champagnes are less common.\nIn most Champagnes, Pinot Meunier contributes to immediate fruitiness; Chardonnay gives finesse, longevity and flavors ranging from citrus to the very strong toasty flavors of maturity; and Pinot Noir adds an appley fruitiness initially, and ages well towards red fruit flavors. The color of rosé Champagnes has to come from Pinot Noir.\nThis world-famous white grape has spread right across the world from its original home in Burgundy. It makes the most famous dry white wines in the world. Chardonnays range from simple, lemony, appley wines to rich, opulent ones with honey, hazelnut, toast, butter, pineapple flavors … Some, such as fine white Burgundies, age extremely well. Chardonnay is one of the three Champagne grapes types, and the only type in Blanc de Blancs Champagnes. Pinot Meunier :\nA close variety of the Pinot Noir, this red grape is one of the Champagne trio. It makes white wine, since the juice is squeezed quickly off the colored skins. Very occasionally it is vinified on its own in the Marne Valley, where it can make very full-bodied Champagnes not without finesse.\nPinot Noir :\nThe grape of the great red Burgundies, Pinot Noir probably originated in Burgundy. It ripens early, producing ruby-colored wines with delicious savory raspberry aromas, with firm tannins and fine acidity, developing exceptional aromas as they age. Pinot Noir is an important Champagne grape variety, indispensable for rosé and blanc de noirs Champagnes.\nOutside France, wine producers are beginning to master the Pinot Noir in New Zealand, Germany, the USA and Australia.\nWe would like to thank the CDT of Aube for the information provided.', 'Alexa K. Apallas on May 3, 2017 0 Comments A bit of bubbly possesses the magical ability to turn even mundane events into a celebration. The pop of the cork, the fizz of the mousse, and the sparkle of the tiny bubbles floating upward in a flute all combine to add a dash of pizzazz to whatever you’ve got planned—even if it’s as low-key as Netflix and chill. And if you turn your day of wine tasting into a day of sparkling wine tasting, you’ll create some truly special memories. All you have to do is follow the itinerary outlined below. But first, let’s take a look at the difference between Champagne and sparkling wine. Is It Champagne or Sparkling Wine? The only sparkling wine that can truly be called Champagne comes from the Champagne region in France. That’s where you’ll find big-name producers, like Bollinger, Krug, Louis Roederer, Moet et Chandon, and Veuve Cliquot. Cristal, name-checked by countless rap and hip-hop artists, is made by Roderer. Dom Perignon, a well-known Champagne made by Moet et Chandon, is named for the Benedictine monk who is referred to as the “Father of Champagne.” He’s rumored to have said, “Come quickly, I am tasting the stars!” when he first tried wine that had gone through a secondary, in-bottle fermentation, thus becoming what we now know as Champagne. But in fact, this secondary fermentation was something that Dom Perignon tried to avoid because it often caused the wine bottles to explode. He did, however, make many improvements to the quality of the still wines that the Champagne region was known for until its sparkling wines became popular during the mid-1700s. Today, when most people hear “Champagne,” they think bubbles. And the Champagne region protects that designation fiercely by enforcing strict quality standards. Champagne production is a carefully controlled process. Only seven grape varietals may be used: Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier, Chardonnay, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, Petit Meslier, and Arbane. Of these, Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier, and Chardonnay are used most often. Champagne rules also specify that the grapes must be handpicked and hand-pressed, and the secondary fermentation must take place in the bottle. Here’s how the secondary fermentation process works: First, the wine is fermented in the barrel, just like any other still wine. Then, it’s transferred to bottles for tirage, where yeast, nutrients, and sugar are added. All these ingredients interact to form Champagne’s trademark bubbles. Then, the spent yeast, or lees, is encouraged to move toward the neck of the bottle through a process called riddling. The wine bottles are placed on a riddling board and turned just a tiny amount each day. Once the wine has aged to perfection sur lie, or on the lees, and the riddling process is complete, the lees is disgorged—along with a little bit of Champagne. The missing wine is refilled, and sometimes a bit of sugar, known as dosage, is added. Then the cork, the cage, and the foil wrap are added. The foil wrap around the neck of a Champagne bottle was originally used to hide the wine lost during disgorgement, but the Champagne (or sparkling wine) you buy now won’t have that fault. Of course, sparkling wine is produced in many other regions. Spain has cava, Italy has prosecco, non-Champagne regions of France have crémant, and Napa has sparkling wine. If you love Champagne but can’t always afford to splurge, look for sparkling wine with the méthode traditionnelle designation — it means the wine has been made according to the same time-honored processes used for true Champagne. Your Itinerary for Napa Valley Sparkling Wine Napa is home to four well-known sparkling wine producers: Domaine Carneros, Domaine Chandon, Mumm, and Schramsberg. With some careful planning—and reservations made well in advance—you can visit all of them. 10:00 AM — Enjoy the Elegance of Domaine Carneros The Taittinger family of France’s Champagne region founded Domaine Carneros back in 1987. Its impressive chateau offers sweeping vineyard views and a lovely patio where you can sit and enjoy tastes of sparkling (and still) wines. But let’s be honest—you’re there for the sparkling. I’m partial to the Brut Rosé, but if you like your bubbles bone-dry, be sure to upgrade to the Grande Tasting so you can try the Ultra Brut. You can nibble on a cheese plate or indulge in a little caviar if you need a mid-morning snack to go with your sparkling.

It’s all about embracing the good life, and each weekend, hundreds of people flock to the winery to do just that. Weekdays are just a touch quieter. You can enjoy a quick flight of sparkling wines while standing at the bar in the tasting room, or snag an open spot out on the terrace or the lawn. Chandon offers a menu of cheese plates, salads, and sandwiches if you’d like to have a light bite before heading to your next appointment. Or, if you’re just stopping in for a brief visit before lunch at one of Yountville’s many fine restaurants, you can sample wine by the glass ($9 to $18) or splurge on a sparkling cocktail ($15 to $20). Details: Address: 1 California Dr, Yountville, CA 94599 Drive: Allow approximately 20 minutes to drive from Domaine Carneros. Booking: Walk-ins welcome, but be prepared for crowds. However, reservations are required for groups of 10 or more—call 888.242.6366, extension 2. Tasting Fee: flights starting at $20 Visit their website 1:30 PM — Tour the Caves at Schramsberg Schramsberg’s history dates back to 1862, when German immigrant Jacob Schram settled on Mount Diamond and began planting his vineyards. The gracious Victorian mansion was completed in 1875, and author Robert Louis Stevenson visited in 1880. But in 1912, the winery ceased operations and the property remained vacant until 1965, when Jack and Jamie Davies purchased the property with the intention of making sparkling wine. Domaine Carneros, Domaine Chandon, and Mumm all offer tours of their production facilities, but the Schramsberg cave tour is truly special. You’ll learn about the traditional method of producing sparkling wine and see the riddling racks where workers hand-turn each bottle. The tour ends with tastes of Schramsberg sparkling, of course, and you’ll savor the wines in an atmospheric, candlelit setting. For me, this is one of the most romantic wine tours in Napa. And the sparkling wine is outstanding, as well. Details: Address: 1400 Schramsberg Rd, Calistoga, CA 94515 Drive: Allow approximately 35 minutes to drive from Domaine Chandon, and don’t be late! Your tour starts promptly at 1:30. Booking Reservations required and tour groups are limited to approximately 12 guests. Reserve online or call 707-942-4558. Tasting Fee: $65 Visit their website 4:00 PM — Sink into Relaxation at Mumm Mumm Napa was founded in the late 1970s and can trace its roots back to the GH Mumm Champagne brand in France. Mumm offers lovely views and attentive service—just the right spot to wind down your sparkling good time in Napa. The classic tasting is always a good bet, but sometimes I like to splurge on the DVX tasting. No reservations are necessary in the main tasting salon or on the patio unless you have a group of six or more. On busy weekends, however, you may have to wait for a table. If you want to guarantee your spot, book a reservation on the Oak Terrace. Sit back, relax, and enjoy a flight of limited-production sparkling wines while gazing out over the vineyards. Cap off your visit with a tour of the Fine Arts Gallery, where photographs by Ansel Adams and Wayne Levin are currently on display. And yes, you can sip your sparkling while in the gallery.

Reservations required for the Oak Terrace. Call 866-783-5826 to reserve. Tasting Fee: $20 to $28 for flights in the tasting salon or on the patio, $50 for the Oak Terrace. Visit their website Congratulations! You’ve packed maximum sparkle into just one day. If you purchased sparkling wine at any of your tasting stops, you can pop open a bottle and re-live the memories whenever you choose. Just be sure you’re storing those bottles properly. Light is the enemy of sparkling wine, and so is heat or any major temperature fluctuation. If you don’t have a cool, dark place in which to store your sparkling, consider investing in a wine refrigerator. And remember, you don’t have to save sparkling wine solely for special occasions. Live it up, and add a little sparkle to a random Thursday. Why not?']"	['<urn:uuid:6aff6912-ef16-4ce5-b290-8b8066aab913>', '<urn:uuid:7d7072e5-9bef-4501-90d9-d0ba23c3168a>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	12	61	2269
9	I want to know why companies need API management when they are working with multiple applications - what does it help them track?	API management helps organizations track usage metrics, security vulnerabilities, user analytics, and revenue generation. It also allows them to modify data, version their APIs, and understand the value of their APIs to their business model. This process helps organizations improve their APIs, retire and scale them, and keep them relevant based on customer demands.	['Applications Programming Interfaces (APIs) are a set of procedures and functions that allow developers to create applications with the ability to access and use data from other applications. They have made it easy for developers to create new applications since the APIs provide the building blocks that the developers need. These blocks are then put together, ensuring that developers do not have to build their applications from scratch.\nHowever, there are many things that work in the background to make sure that APIs do what they are supposed to do. A developer implementing an API needs to make sure that they understand these things, and use them properly if their API is to be efficient. Among the most important things that developers should pay attention to are API management and API gateway.\nOften, developers confuse the two terms, as well as their functions. These two perform different functions in the lifetime of an API and are very crucial in determining how successful an API will be.\nAPI Management Vs API Gateway\nAs discussed above, developers need to understand these two, their functions, and how they contribute to the performance of their APIs. There are key differences in what they are and how they operate, but their main objective is to make sure that the API does exactly what it is supposed to do.\nWhat is API Management?\nTechnology advancement has made sure that there are new innovative applications being built every other day. These applications are implementing APIs, something that has also contributed to the large number of APIs we have today.\nHowever, these APIs need to be managed. A single organization might be building and implementing multiple APIs at the same time. They need to see things such as usage metrics, security vulnerabilities, user analytics, and revenue generation. They will also need to be able to modify data, version their APIs, and understand the value of their APIs to their business model.\nThey cannot do this without API management. It is the process through which organizations are able to see all the above things, making sure that they (organizations) can improve their APIs, retire and scale them, and keep them relevant depending on customer demands.\nWhat is an API Gateway?\nThe API gateway acts as the intermediary between the client and the server. It is the single point of entry for all requests made by the client and is responsible for routing all the requests made by the client to the right resource on the server.\nWhen a user accesses an application on their browser (the client), a request is sent to the server. This request does not go directly to the server, but to the API gateway. The gateway then redirects the request to the right resource in the server, or to the right resources in the case of the microservices architecture where one request might require responses from multiple resources.\nThe server then gets a response and sends it back to the API gateway. Just like with the request, the gateway then redirects the response back to the original client that had made the request. Apart from that, the API gateway can be used to filter traffic from third-party applications as well as for authentication.\nSo, Are They Different?\nAPI gateway and API management are two different terms with different meanings. When building and implementing APIs, among the things that organizations need to consider when hiring developers is whether they know where and how to use each one of them.\nThose running multiple APIs can implement the same API management strategies for all of their APIs. This is important in ensuring consistency. API management is a process that takes place from the time an API is incepted to the time it is retired.\nOn the other hand, developers can either use a single API gateway for all of their APIs or use separate gateways depending on their requirements. The gateway will also be phenomenal in managing token management, authorization, logging, and rate-limiting.']	['<urn:uuid:bd1ff1a4-5737-4b8e-9e62-26f6ed36e5af>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	23	54	665
10	what diagnostic tests used locate kidney stones how often do stones come back after first episode	Diagnostic tests for kidney stones include renal ultrasound (using sound waves to take pictures), CT scan (creating 3-D pictures), and KUB X-ray (using external radiation to view the urinary tract). After the first episode of kidney stones, there is a 10% recurrence rate, which increases to 30-40% within 5 years and 50-60% within a decade.	"[""Kidney stones are often diagnosed in the Emergency Department, when children come in with severe belly or side pain. The following may be used to diagnose and locate stones.\nAs part of the Image Gently campaign, doctors at Cincinnati Children’s make every effort to minimize how much radiation children receive.\nRenal ultrasound: The most common radiologic test used to diagnose a urinary tract stone is an ultrasound. The technician slides a hand-held device known as a transducer across the child’s skin. This is a painless test using sound waves to take pictures of the kidneys, ureters and bladder. The images created may show the location of any stone(s).\nCT scan: The child lies flat on a platform that slides into a doughnut-shaped device. X-ray technology is used to create three-dimensional (3-D) pictures of sections of the body to determine the location(s) of the stones(s). CT scans for kidney stones may require the injection of contrast dye to aid in locating the stone(s). The lowest possible amount of radiation will be used to provide the necessary diagnosis.\nKidney, ureter, bladder (KUB) X-ray. A quick, simple X-ray uses external radiation to assess your child’s abdomen and view the urinary tract and the presence of any stone(s).\nVarious urine tests such as a urine analysis and urine culture can be used to check for the presence of a urinary tract infection. Other tests such as a 24-hour urine collection can measure the levels of chemicals that can form stones.\nOnce a stone has passed, it is analyzed to determine its chemical composition. Different types of stone have different causes.\nOur nephrologist may order additional metabolic and blood tests based on your child’s history and physical examination.\nOur geneticist may order blood tests to determine if your child or your child’s biological family has a genetic predisposition for stone disease (see more below).\nDiet is often linked to stone formation. Based on your child’s testing and stone analysis, he or she may be referred to a dietitian for a consultation. The dietitian will evaluate your child's daily intake of calcium, vitamin D, fruits, vegetables, salt and protein to determine if your child's diet is related to his or her stone formation.\nHigh urine concentrations of various elements such as calcium, phosphorous and oxalate can lead to kidney stones. In children who are susceptible, certain foods may increase the likelihood of stone formation.\nGenetics can play an important role in kidney stone disease. Around 35 to 40 percent of people who form kidney stones have family members who also had stones. People who inherit this trait often begin forming stones early in life and tend to have repeated episodes. Our geneticist may order blood tests to determine whether your child or your child’s biological family has a genetic predisposition for stone disease.\nThe genetics of kidney stone formation is complex and we are learning more about it all the time. Examples of conditions with a genetic basis include:\n- Hypercalciuria (excessive amounts of calcium in the urine), which may be caused by defects in a number of genes. Elevated urine calcium increases the likelihood of stone formation.\n- Hypocitraturia (too little citrate in the urine) may also have a genetic basis. Citrate prevents kidney stones, so not having enough of it may increase a person’s risk of developing stones.\n- Primary hyperoxaluria results from a liver enzyme defect causing the production of large amounts of the chemical oxalate, which, in turn, results in high levels of oxalate being eliminated in the urine. Oxalate combines with calcium to form the most common type of kidney stone.\n- Cystinuria is an inherited disease in which the kidney excretes too much of the amino acid cystine into the urine, resulting in the formation of cystine stones."", ""- What is Urolithiasis?\n- What types of urinary stones are there?\n- What are the Risk Factors of Urolithiasis?\n- What are the signs and symptoms in Urolithiasis?\n- How is Urolithiasis diagnosed?\n- How is Urolithiasis treated?\n- How are stones removed?\n- How should the patient be followed up?\n- How can Urolithiasis be prevented?\nWhat is Urolithiasis?\nUrolithiasis -or else called Urinary Calculosis- is the formation of stones (calculi) anywhere in the urinary tract (in the renal pyelocalyceal system, ureter, bladder, urethra). It is the third most common urinary tract disease in humans, following urinary tract infections and prostatic diseases. According to localization, there is renal lithiasis (nephrolithiasis), ureter lithiasis (stones in the tubules through which urine flows from kidneys to the bladder), bladder lithiasis and urethral lithiasis (stones in the tubule ejecting urine from the bladder outwards).\nWhat types of urinary stones are there?\n- Calcium-based stones. This is the most common type of stone occurring more frequently in men aged 20-30 years old. Calcium binds with other substances, such as oxalates and phosphorus, and finally the stone is formed.\n- Cystine Stones. They occur in patients suffering from Cystinuria, a hereditary disease afflicting both genders.\n- Struvite stones. They are usually formed in women suffering from urinary tract infections. These stones may become very large in size.\n- Uric acid stones. They occur more frequently in men than women. Patients undergoing chemotherapy are a high risk group for developing uric acid stones.\n- More rare types of stones are formed in patients taking drugs, such as Aciclovir, Indinavir and Triamterene.\nWhat are the risk factors of Urolithiasis?\nUrinary stones are related with various risk factors that have to do either with each person's temperament (endogenous risk factors) or with the environment (exogenous risk factors). Usually there is a combination of both endogenous and exogenous factors leading to the formation of stones.\nEndogenous risk factors include:\n- Age - Stones are more common at the age group 20-50 years old.\n- Gender - Urolithiasis occurs 3 times more frequently in men than in women.\n- Family history/ Heredity - About 25% of patients with urolithiasis report that there is or was another member of their family with the same problem.\nExogenous risk factors inclue:\n- Climate conditions: People living in warm climates are more likely to develop stones.\n- Nutrition: High consumption of salt, animal albumen and fat is strongly associated with stone formation. Also, as opposed to what is widely believed, high calcium consumption (dairy products) also favors the development of stones.\n- Obesity: High body weight predisposes stone formation.\n- Fluid intake: Low fluid consumption -particularly if it is less than 1,5lt/day- increases the risk for the development of stones. Even water hardness is a factor related to high stone rate.\n- Vocation (job): People with a more mental and sedentary vocation have higher risk for developing stones compared to those having a manual or more physical vocation.\n- Pharmacotherapy: Specific antihypertensives, antiacid agents and therapies for immunosuppresed patients (e.g. HIV patients) predispose the formation of stones.\nWhat are the signs and symptoms in Urolithiasis?\nMany patients with urinary stones have no signs at all. The first symptoms occur when some stone moves to the ureter inhibiting urine flow from kidneys. The most common symptom is renal colic, that is strong pain in the region of kidneys, bladder or external genitalia. Pain usually occurs abruptly, is not relieved when changing position and is usually accompanied with nausea or even vomiting. There is often hematuria, which is microscopic -discovered in the general urine test- and, more rarely, macroscopic -visible in the urine. Sometimes, when there is concomitant urinary tract infection, urolithiasis may present symptoms such as shivering, fatigue, dysuria (painful micturition) and renal pain. Many are the times that urolithiasis is diagnosed accidentally when the patient undergoes imaging screening for some other irrelevant reason.\nHow is Urolithiasis diagnosed?\nThe diagnosis is based on the patient's history, clinical examination and on required laboratory and imaging screening tests. The history and clinical examination set the suspicion for lithiasis to the Urologist and diagnostic tests aim at confirming the diagnosis, investigating functionality and morphology of the urinary tract and identifying potential etiological factors that may be involved in stone formation. Screening tests required for the investigation of urolithiasis are divided in imaging and laboratory tests. The therapist physician will recommend which tests are necessary according to the case.\nImaging screening tests:\n- Plain X-ray of kidneys, ureters and bladder (KUB X-ray): It traces about 80-90% of stones. However, there are stones (such as uric acid stones) that are not visible with KUB X-ray.\n- UltraSound (U/S) of the urinary tract:: It provides information on the presence of obstruction (hydronephrosis) and can trace stones located in the kidney or bladder, but not in the ureter.\n- Intravenous Urography or Pyelography: It demonstrates the exact location of stones, as well as any anatomic abnormalities that may exist and predispose stone formation. It is also useful for evaluating renal functionality and the degree of hydronephrosis.\n- CTscan without contrast medium: Today this is the screening method of choice used in most urological centers for investigating urolithiasis, as it is diagnostically superior to intravenous urography and provides high-resolution imaging of renal anatomy.\n- General urine test (Urinalysis): There are usually red blood cells (erythrocytes) in the urine and sometimes there are also elements of urinary tract infection.\n- Biochemical blood analysis: Measurement of urea, creatinine, uric acid and calcium in serum plasma.\n- Parathormone: Hormone secreted by the parathyroid glands; it is measured in cases of high calcium values, for there may be glandular overfunction that contributes to stone formation.\n- 24-hour urine collection: The aim is to determine the patient's metabolic condition for identifying any potential metabolic abnormality that could be responsible for stone formation.\n- Stone analysis: Once the stone is removed, it is analyzed in specialized laboratories to identify the type of stone and take the proper measures that are necessary for reducing the chances of urolithiasis recurrence and relapse.\nHow is Urolithiasis treated?\nDuring the phase of strong pain (renal colic), special pharmaceutical agents are administered to relieve the patient from pain. These agents come in injectable form called 'Non-steroid Anti-inflammatory Drugs' (NSADs) acting as pain relievers and reducing local edema. If pain persists, stronger analgesics can be administered, such as opioid analgesics. For preventing further renal colic attacks, oral NSADs are administered for 7 days; an inhibitor of a-adrenergic receptors can also be administered (usually given to men for prostate hyperplasia).\nImmediate intervention is required only in a small number of patients, when:\n- pain persists despite pharmaceutical treatment\n- obstruction impairs renal function\n- there is also urinary tract infection with fever\nIn these cases, there may be need for a pig-tail catheter to be placed. With the use of special instruments inserted through the urethra, the physician reaches the bladder and advances the catheter through the ureter to the kidney. In case this is not feasible, the tubule is inserted through the skin (percutaneous nephrostomy). If possible, the stone is removed at the same time.\nWith some types of stones, the therapist physician may prescribe medication aiming at either reducing the size of stone or preventing its reformation. Pharmacotherapy depends on the stone composition and presence or absence of metabolic disease.\nHow are stones removed?\nStone removal depends on the size and location of stone in the urinary tract. When the stone is less than 1cm in size and treated pharmaceutically, in 70% of cases the stone will automatically subside on its own within a period of 4-6 weeks. In the rest of the cases, there will be need for invasive therapy aiming at the fragmentation and removal of the stone/s.\nInvasive methods include:\n- Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL): The stone is broken with the use of shock waves. It is usually well tolerated by the patient and has 90% success rate. However, there are still some stones which cannot break with ESWL.\n- Ureteroscopy and Intracorporeal Lithotripsy: It is used for removing stones located in the ureter. The ureteroscope is inserted through the urethra into the ureter until localizing the stone and removing its fragments. The most modern method is Laser LIthotripsy.\n- Percutaneous Nephrolithotripsy (PNL) : It is applied for removing large or/and dense kidney stones that do not break with extracorporeal lithotripsy. The nephroscope is inserted through the skin into the kidney, localizes the stone and breaks it up with the use of special ultrasonic or ballistic devices.\n- Open Surgery: Today it is used only for very few selected cases.\nHow should the patient be followed up?\nThere is 10% recurrence rate after the first urolithiasis episode, while the rate increases to 30-40% within the next 5 years and to 50-60% within a decade. That is why follow-up should be individualized according to each one's predisposition. This follow-up will be determined by the therapist physician with renal-bladder ultrasound and plain x-rays of kidneys, ureters and bladder (KUB X-ray).\nIt is also imperative to take measures for avoiding urolithiasis relapse. Thus, patients should consume plenty of fluids (2,5-3 liters/day), have a balanced nutrition with vegetable fibres, avoid consuming large amounts of salt, animal albumen and fat and consume a moderate amount of dairy products. In addition, in the case of obese patients, loss of body weight and moderate physical exercise contribute significantly to reducing relapse risk. Such precaution measures may prevent stone recurrence in 75% of cases.""]"	['<urn:uuid:0d707da8-dbad-464e-9162-77718ba9eec5>', '<urn:uuid:7fe72e93-66bb-4f78-ba97-97bca6357291>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	16	55	2215
11	gray whales arctic terns distance traveled comparison	Gray whales migrate 10,000-14,000 miles, which is the longest known migration route for a mammal. However, Arctic terns travel even further, covering 12,500 miles one-way from Antarctica to Arctic Refuge each spring, totaling 25,000 miles annually. Over their 30-year lifespan, Arctic terns may fly over 750,000 miles.	['Scientific Name: Eschrichtius robustus\nWhen is the best time to view Gray Whales in Monterey Bay and where is the best viewing?\nGray whales are typically seen in the Monterey Bay from December through May. In the winter they travel South to Baja California for reproduction. They peak in numbers traveling through the Monterey Bay around mid-January.\nIn the Spring, February through May, the whales are traveling North with their babies through the Monterey Bay. These number peak around mid-March. During this migration, the whales travel closer to shore to protect their babies.\nViewing these whales from a boat is the best viewing and there are many whale watching tours available. You can still see the whales from land most most Monterey Bay shorelines. One great place to do this is Pt. Lobos State Natural Reserve because of its high view point along the trails.\nAbout Gray Whales\nThe gray whale is mostly gray with some white patches and scratches. Their skin feels like a peeled, hard-boiled egg and bumpy where there are patches of barnacles, whale lice and other organisms along for the ride. Gray whales have streamlined bodies with narrow heads. They have a natural overbite, as the upper jaw slightly overlaps the lower jaw. The gray whale does not have throat pleating or a dorsal (top) fin. However, about 2/3 of the way back on the body is a dorsal hump. The dorsal hump is followed by 6–12 knuckles along the dorsal ridge, which extend to the tail.\nGray whales travel in groups called pods and surface to breathe. An adult can stay submerged up to 15 minutes. Gray whales have a double blowhole. A gray whale spout or blow can reach up to 15 feet, and looks like a heart from the front or back. Instead of teeth, gray whales have baleen. Baleen is made of keratin (same substance found in human hair and nails) and is similar to bristles of a toothbrush. Gray whales use their baleen to strain food from the seafloor. The gray whale opens its mouth underwater, letting in water, krill and other tiny creatures. The whale then pushes the water out as its baleen filters the food from the water. Baleen was once used to make corsets and umbrella ribs.\nWhat do Gray Whales and elephants have in common and other Gray Whale fun facts.\n- Same size and weight as 10 good-sized elephants\n- Tail-flukes can weigh up to 400 lbs. alone, 10–12 feet across\n- The heart of a gray whale weighs over 285 lbs.\n- Hunted to the edge of extinction, the Gray whale was given protection by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in 1937 & 1947\n- Can dive up to 395 ft., travel at 3–6 mph and be submerged for up to 15 min.\n- Calves nurse 7–8 months on milk that is 53% fat (human milk is 2% fat)\n- Migrate 10,000–14,000 miles, which is the longest known migration route for a mammal\n- Their crusty ocean rock appearance is due to several hundred pounds of parasites covering their skin.\nHabitat: Migrate along the North American coastline from Alaskan waters to the Mexican coast. Mate and give birth in warmer waters of Baja, California.\nSize: Newborn calves average 16 ft. Males average 43 ft. and Females average 46 ft. Can be up to 50 ft.\nDiet: bottom feeder, consists mainly of sand crab-like crustaceans called amphipods\nLifespan: About 40 years', '(This piece was written and submitted by Susan Sorg, and originally appeared on OneWildLife.) Evolution has linked migratory birds with the perfect habitat, so much so that the benefits of the Arctic tundra and its abundant insects, invertebrates, and vegetation outweighs the risks of migrating thousands of miles.\nAbove: An Arctic loon stretches its wings. (Richard Spener Photography)\nBy: Susan Sorg\nA higher consciousness of interconnection will shift the global trajectory of habitat loss and reawaken us to the roots of human evolution and web of life. As advocates for wilderness, we validate our higher consciousness and what it means to protect a place we may never actually see, as the Arctic Refuge. Humans have never been separate from the web of life, and our own survival is inherently linked to acting on this understanding.\nA male and female king eider (Florian Schulz / www.florianschulz.org)\nEvolution has linked migratory birds with the perfect habitat, so much so that the benefits of the Arctic tundra and its abundant insects, invertebrates and vegetation outweigh the risks of migrating thousands of miles. Biologist and author Bernd Heinrich explains in Winter World: “Each bird species, like every organism on Earth, feels most at home in the specific environment to which it has been tailored by natural selection and instinctively seeks that environment and avoids others.”\nThe Arctic Refuge coastal plain is the tailored habitat for nearly two hundred species of birds that converge there every spring. An intricate evolutionary story of adaptation, evolution and biological forces has performed on this stage for tens of thousands of years. Birds from six continents transform the tundra into one of the planet’s most biodiverse nesting grounds with an explosion of new life.\nYet the unthinkable happened in December making the future of the Arctic Refuge precarious, when the GOP tax plan was signed into law. Pro-oil GOP politicians manipulated the legislative process and found a loophole to include drilling the Arctic Refuge in their tax bill.\nArctic tern (Tapio Kaisla Flickr CC)\nThe Arctic tern travels 12,500 miles one-way from its overwintering grounds in Antarctica to nest on the Arctic Refuge each spring and is the longest-distance flyer of any bird on the planet. This four-ounce bird with long, narrow wings is well adapted for slow, low-altitude flight and spends the majority of its life ‘en route’ to its next destination or a migratory stopover in-between. It migrates 25,000 miles every year for the Arctic’s abundant food and habitat. Terns can live over thirty years and may fly over 750,000 miles in their lifetime.\n“Virtually every species of bird that occurs in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is migratory,” explains David Sibley in Seasons of Life and Land, Subhankar Banarjee’s two-year photographic journey of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\nIf drilling occurs on the coastal plain, terns would arrive to discover the nesting grounds they’ve evolved with and migrated to for possibly millions of years defiled by industrial trucks, drills, roads and noise.\nThe tern population on the Atlantic coast is declining because parent terns cannot find herring to feed their young, and chicks cannot digest any alternate fish. Thousands of tern chicks have been found washed up on the shore. Herring is disappearing from ocean warming caused by climate change and from over-fishing.\nSemipalmated plovers on an Arctic shore (Richard Spener / www.richardspenerphotography.com)\nTundra swans (Paul Konrad)\nHabitat loss, climate change, pesticides, herbicides and trophy hunting are taking a deadly toll on birds and wildlife. The Nature Needs Half movement launched by biologist and author E. O. Wilson gives hope that with cooperative efforts to preserve the intact wilderness that still exists, there may be time to save species.\nSince Subhankar Banarjee began his two-year photographic journey of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in 2001, climate change has dramatically accelerated. We wonder now if the mother polar bears are able to feed their cubs or even find enough snow for a den. The muskox baby he observed risked becoming a predator’s meal, but now the Arctic’s warmer, rainy winters induced by climate change are proving deadly to muskox herds as they fall through ice, are trapped and drown.\nPectoral sandpiper (Richard Spener / www.richardspenerphotography.com)\nClimate change, created by industry and agriculture, has become the planet’s predator. Changes in choices and behavior are the only way to slow its wrath.\nOpening the Arctic Refuge to oil drilling will only exacerbate the effects of climate change in Alaska, effects which are no longer theory but reality as villages lose coastlines and winter ice that their economies depend upon. We do not need the oil that certain politicians propose we do—we have a surplus. What we do need is for progressive representatives to help us achieve true national security through global leadership in sustainable energy. Increasing oil and gas drilling in the Arctic is taking a huge step backwards that will worsen climate change and destroy one of the Earth’s greatest remaining intact ecosystems.\nBiologists worried by migratory birds’ starvation, seen as tied to climate change, Darryl Fears.

12	What are the recommended ways to protect financial information when banking in person, and what technology-based safeguards should be implemented for online banking security?	For in-person banking, you should vary your banking routine (days, times, branches), never withdraw money for anyone but yourself, use your body as a shield when entering access codes, and never keep PIN numbers in wallets. For online banking technology safeguards, you should install commercial anti-virus software, maintain an actively managed firewall, create strong passwords with at least 10 characters including mixed case letters and special characters, regularly update security software, and ensure computers are patched regularly with security updates.	"['DID YOU KNOW?\n\'Credit Card Skimming,’ is a method thieves use to steal your credit card information. They use a little illicit technology that captures the card’s magnetic information, allowing the data to be used for fraudulent purchases. Criminals can have a skimmer stashed out of sight of customers. Make sure your card stays within view at all times. If you have become a victim of skimming, call the police. Contact the bank or credit card issuer and immediately tell them your card data has been stolen.\nWhat is Phishing? - Facebook Topic\nIn 2015, the most common type of Facebook scam is called Phishing. You could get links from people informing to click to get prizes or cash. These are received either by chat or posting on your Facebook page. This needs to be reported to Facebook once these types of messages are received.\nFOR THE HOLIDAYS\n1.Beware of phony charities.\n2. Do not confirm your identity in emails.\n3. Leave lights on when you are not home.\n4. Keep your garage door closed at all times.\n5. Get estimates and referrals for home repairs.\n6. Take a friend or family member when shopping.\n7. Don’t talk on the phone while walking to the car!\n8.Go through a licensed company for health care aids.\n9. Do not give out personal information on the phone.\n10. Check your finances regularly for fraudulent activity.\n11. Don’t answer the door if you are not expecting someone.\n12. If you feel uneasy about someone, get security to escort you to your car.\nADDITIONAL WAYS TO KEEP YOUR SELF SAFE\nDon\'t assume you are safe because it is daylight. Crime occurs just as often during the day as during the night.\nConsider carrying a cell phone for emergencies.\nCriminals look for victims who they think will be easy targets and will be surprised - walk confidently.\nIf something makes you uneasy, trust your instincts and leave.\nBe aware of your surroundings! Constantly look to your left, to your right and behind you to see if anyone is following you.\nDo not carry identification with your name and address on your key ring. If your keys are stolen, the thief has your address along with your keys.\nProtect Your Home\nDo not hide keys in mailboxes and planters or under doormats. Give an extra set of keys to a trusted neighbor or friend.\nStop newspaper and mail deliveries if you are going away.\nConsider an alarm system for fire, burglaries, and medical emergencies.\nDon\'t lève your house unlocked during the day while doing outside projects.\nNever open your door before knowing who is there. Install and use a peephole. Have deadbolts installed on doors. For sliding glass doors, have a hole drilled through both doors and secure with a pin through both holes.\nIf you arrive at homes and suspect a stranger may be inside, don\'t go in. Leave quietly and call 911 to report the crime as soon as possible.\nIf you have an answering machine, leave a message so it seems as though you don\'t live alone - something like ""Sorry, we cannot come to the phone...""\nAvoid Deceptive Lending Practices\nSlow Down! Never act quickly! Avoid lenders who promise guaranteed, low-interest loans and next-day approval if you pay them some money today.\nNever sign the title to a property without clearing the mortgage.\nAvoid balloon payments! These loans sound attractive because the monthly payment is small, but the last payment is very large.\nHave at least two other people you trust read a contract before you sign it.\nIf you have questions about the mortgage loan, call Housing Contact Services at\nBeware of workers driving around neighborhoods offering repairs for a low price with leftovers from previous jobs! It will cost you a lot more when the job is done.\nGet at least three estimates before hiring someone to do home repairs and call the Better Business Bureau ((330) 253-4565) or check their website (www.akronbbb.org) before you hire someone to do a job for you.\nIf someone starts repairs on your home without your permission, call the police immediately!\nAsk for I.D. from service representatives who come to your home and check with their company to verify their identity before letting them in.\nBeware of Con Artists\nBeware of men and women who approach you with a sad story and ask to borrow money from you. This is a common scam!\nBeware of persons dressed as construction workers or meter readers wanting in your home! They usually work in pairs and while one is distracting you, the other is stealing your valuables. Call the company where they say they work before letting them in your home.\nBeware of men and women who approach you in stores asking for help with finding an item. These con artists work in pairs. While one person is distracting your attention by asking for help, another person is stealing your wallet.\nBeware of a professional-looking person who tells you he is a bank official and needs your help in the investigation of a dishonest teller. He asks you to withdraw cash from your savings account and give the money to him so he can check the serial numbers. You do what he asks, and you never see him or your money again.\nDon\'t fight with a purse snatcher! Let go of your purse. Your safety is more important.\nIf carrying a wallet, don\'t carry it in your pocket. Keep it in the front pocket or inside pocket.\nDon\'t dangle a purse so a thief can run by and grab it! If wearing a coat, carry your purse over your shoulder and under your coat.\nDon\'t leave your purse unattended in a shopping cart. If you purse has a handle, buckle it in with the child safety belt. Double it a couple times and buckle. If someone tries to grab your purse, they will have to take the cart with them.\nBeware of cars driving past you slowly. Purses are often snatched by criminals in moving vehicles.\nWhen driving, keep you purse on the passenger floor of the car where it is more difficult for someone to reach in and grab it.\nBe Cautious of Telemarketers\nDon\'t give out personal or financial information over the phone.\nDon\'t give out your name. If they called you, they should know your name.\nYou may want to invest in a Caller-ID box to see who is calling before you pick up the phone. If you don\'t recognize the number, you don\'t have to answer it.\nBe cautious of high pressure sales tactics such as prizes, awards, and deals that are only available if you act right away. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is not true. If in doubt, hang up the phone. In Ohio, it is against the law to require anyone to make a purchase or pay anything to claim a prize.\nRequest written information form any organization soliciting you over the phone and have someone you trust review it before you act.\nIf you suspect fraud, call the National Fraud Information Center at (330) 876-7060\nSafeguard Your Finances\nHave your social security or pension check directly deposited into your account.\nBe sure the person who handles your money can be trusted. Do not sign a check or contract until you are sure it is for a legitimate reason.\nIf you receive checks in the mail, arrange for them to be sent directly to the bank.\nVary the routine of your banking: days, times, and branches.\nNever withdraw money from your bank accounts for anyone except yourself.\nUse your body as a shelf while you enter your access code, so no one can see you type it and never tell your access code to ANYONE (including bank employees, the police, etc.)!\nUse a shredder to keep sensitive information from inadvertently falling into the wrong hands.\nDo not give out personal information over the phone. Also, do not confirm the information someone may say they have.\nPut outgoing mail in a secure box so no one can take it.\nDo not put your social security number on checks or other documents.\nCancel unused credit cards and shred them. Shred checks left from a closed account as well.\nNever keep your pin number in your wallet or purse or allow someone easy access to it.\nTake credit card receipts and carbons with you so someone else does not have access to your name and number.\nGo with a family member or friend when possible and park near an entrance.\nDon\'t carry large sums of money.\nLock bundles or bags in the trunk. If interesting, packages are out of sight, a thief will be less tempted to break into your car.\nHave your keys ready when you approach your car.\nFollow your instincts! If you get a bad feeling about someone while walking to your car, don\'t ignore that feeling. Return to the store and find someone to escort you to the car.\nPay close attention to any persons sitting in a car or van parked next to your car. If you feel uneasy, enter your car from the opposite side or return to the store for an escort.\nWhen returning to your car, check the front and back seat before entering.\nDon\'t carry large sums of money on you. Use travelers\' checks instead that can be easily replaced.\nCarry your money, ID cards, and credit cards in a money belt under clothing rather than carrying a purse or wallet. This keeps it hidden from plain view and close to your body at all times.\nDon\'t count your dollars in public when leaving a restaurant, store, etc., or display large sums of money. Use a cash card or credit card whenever possible.\nIf you go on vacation, set timers for lights and appliances to go on at different times. A lived-in house is less likely to be targeted.\nIf you will be renting a car, study the area in advance. Ask your hotel clerk or travel agent about unsafe areas to avoid.\nWhen you stop behind another car at a traffic light, make sure you leave enough room so you can safely pass around the front.\nIf you are alone in your car and someone bumps your car from behind or if your car breaks down, stay in your car. Ask another motorist to call for help if you do not have a cell phone.\nIs Your Friend A Victim of Abuse\nNotice changes in your friends. Does your friend have unexplained bumps, bruises or cuts?\nIf you don\'t hear from elderly friends for several days, stop by and check on them.\nBe alert to salesmen at elderly friends\' homes.\nIf elderly friends tell you about someone, including family members, inappropriately spending their money, report it to the police.\nNotice the condition of elderly friends\' homes. Are their homes clean? Does your friend look malnourished? Is your friend receiving proper medication?\nStart a buddy system where you and a close friend or neighbor check in with each other once a day.\nCall Adult Protective Services for help at (330) 643-7217.\nHelpful hints for Seniors to protect themselves.\n( But not just for seniors )\nProvided by: Sherri Bevan Walsh - Summit County Prosecuter\nPeople Care Pet Pantry', ""Online Privacy Practices\nOnline Banking Protection\nReport Suspicious Emails\nProtect Your Identity\nCorporate Account Takeover\nWhat is Corporate Account Takeover?\n“Corporate account takeover” is when cyber-thieves gain control of a business’ bank account(s) by stealing the business’ valid online banking credentials. Although there are several methods being employed to steal credentials, the most prevalent involves malware that infects the business’ computer workstations and laptops.\nA business can become infected with malware via infected documents attached to an email or a link contained within an email that connects to an infected Web site. In addition, malware can be downloaded to users’ workstations and laptops by visiting legitimate Web sites - especially social networking sites - and clicking on the documents, videos or photos posted there. This malware can also spread across a business’ internal network.\nRecommendations to Business and Corporate Customers\nAlthough Guaranty Bond Bank uses technologies to prevent, detect and respond to fraudulent transactions, there are additional controls that you can institute within your organization to further reduce the risk of Corporate Account Takeover and fraud.\nReconcile your banking transactions on a daily basis.\nInitiate ACH and wire transfer payments under dual control, with a transaction originator and a separate transaction authorizer.\nEmploy best practices to secure computer systems in their business including but not limited to:\nIf possible, carry out all online banking activities from a stand-alone, hardened and completely locked down computer system from which email and Web browsing are not possible.\nBe suspicious of emails purporting to be from a financial institution, government department or other agency requesting account information, account verification or banking access credentials such as usernames, passwords, PIN codes and similar information. Opening file attachments or clicking on web links in suspicious emails could expose the system to malicious code that could hijack your computer.\nInstall a dedicated, actively managed firewall, especially if the business has a broadband or dedicated connection to the Internet, such as DSL or cable. A firewall limits the potential for unauthorized access to a network and computers.\nCreate strong passwords with at least 10 characters that include a combination of mixed case letters, numbers and special characters.\nProhibit the use of “shared” usernames and passwords for online banking systems.\nUse a different password for each Web site that is accessed.\nChange the password a few times each year.\nNever share username and password information for Online Services with third-party providers.\nLimit administrative rights on users’ workstations to help prevent the inadvertent downloading of malware or other viruses.\nEducate employees on good cyber security practices to include how to avoid having malware installed on the business computer.\nInstall commercial anti-virus and desktop firewall software on all computer systems. Free software may not provide protection against the latest threats compared with an industry standard product.\nEnsure virus protection and security software are updated regularly.\nEnsure computers are patched regularly particularly operating system and key application with security patches. It may be possible to sign up for automatic updates for the operating system and many applications.\nConsider installing spyware detection programs.\nClear the browser cache before starting an Online Banking session in order to eliminate copies of web pages that have been stored on the hard drive. How the cache is cleared will depend on the browser and version. This function is generally found in the browser's preferences menu.\nVerify use of a secure session (https:// not http://) in the browser for all online financial transactions, including online banking.\nAvoid using automatic login features that save usernames and passwords for online banking.\nNever leave a computer unattended while using any online banking or investing service.\nNever access bank, brokerage or other financial services information at Internet cafes, public libraries, etc. Unauthorized software may have been installed to trap account number and sign on information leaving the customer vulnerable to possible fraud.\nProperly log out of each online banking session and close all browser windows. Simply closing the active window may not be enough.\nWhen finished with the computer, turn it off or disconnect it from the Internet.\nAlso consider utilizing a security expert to test the network or run security software that will aid you in identifying known vulnerabilities.\nConsumer account holders receive protections from errors relative to electronic funds transfers under Regulation E; however we want to make you aware that Regulation E does not cover Business accounts.\nThe alerts and notifications offered by the bank are designed as flags to warn you if your system may have been compromised and we strongly encourage you to take advantage of them.\nWarning signs that your system/network may have been compromised include:\nInability to log into online banking (thieves could be blocking customer access so the customer won’t see the theft until the criminals have control of the money);\nDramatic loss of computer speed;\nChanges in the way things appear on the screen;\nComputer locks up so the user is unable to perform any functions;\nUnexpected rebooting or restarting of the computer;\nUnexpected request for a one time password (or token) in the middle of an online session;\nUnusual pop-up messages, especially a message in the middle of a session that says the connection to the bank system is not working (system unavailable, down for maintenance, etc.);\nNew or unexpected toolbars and/or icons; and Inability to shut down or restart the computer.\nContact the bank immediately if you suspect your network may have been compromised.

13	looking to compare the size of sedan crater nevada with vredefort crater south africa which one bigger	The Vredefort Crater in South Africa is significantly larger than the Sedan Crater in Nevada. The Sedan Crater, created by a nuclear test in 1962, is 1,200 feet (366 meters) wide, while the Vredefort Crater has a radius of 118 miles (190 kilometers), making it the world's largest known impact structure.	"['- Project Plowshare and the Sedan Experiment\n- Taking a Tour of the Sedan Crater\nSedan Crater is located at 37°10’36.5”N 116°02’47.0”W (37.176820, -116.046382) in Area 10 on the Nevada National Security Site (formerly the Nevada Test Site) near Mercury, Nye County, Nevada. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places (#94000183) on March 21, 1994.\nThe United States Atomic Energy Commission’s Project Plowshare was intended to develop techniques to use nuclear explosives for peaceful construction purposes. In the 1960s and 1970s, during the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union carried out a number of Peaceful Nuclear Explosions (PNE).\nThe PNEs were nuclear explosions conducted for non-military purposes, such as activities related to economic development, the creation of canals, rock blasting, stimulation of tight gas, chemical element manufacture (test shot Anacostia resulted in Curium-250m being discovered), unlocking some of the mysteries of the so-called “r-Process” of stellar nucleosynthesis, probing the composition of the Earth’s deep crust, creating reflection seismology data, and mining company prospecting.\nThere was significant public opposition to Project Plowshare’s 27 nuclear projects, which eventually led to the program’s termination in 1977. Some of the consequences of the program included the deposition of fallout from radioactive material being injected into the atmosphere and tritiated water (T2O, a radioactive form of water where the usual hydrogen atoms are replaced with tritium) which was projected to increase to a level of 2% of the then-maximum level for drinking water.\nThe Sedan Experiment was a part of Project Plowshare to take place at the Nevada Test Site consisted of detonating a 100-kiloton thermonuclear device 635 feet underground. The device was relatively clean as far as thermonuclear devices go—fission contributed less than 30% of the total yield. The device was buried in a 36-inch diameter cased hole that was back-filled with sand.\nThe predicted crater diameter was 1,200–1,400 feet (366–427 meters) and the depth from about 170–300 feet (52–91 meters). About 95 per cent of the radioactivity produced by the explosion would be trapped underground. The heavier fallout would be confined to within about two miles upwind and crosswind, and four miles downwind of ground zero.\nOn July 6, 1962 at 10:00 PDT (17:00:00 UT) the device was detonated. The detonation created a crater 1,200 feet (366 meters) across and 320 feet (98 meters) deep. About 7.5 million cubic yards (5.7 million cubic meters)—12 million US tons (10.9 million metric tons)—of earth and rock were removed. A 12,000-foot (3658-meter) dust cloud formed of some of the smaller earth particles. The lip of the crater (Hal in the diagram below) varied in height from about 20 feet (6 meters) to 100 feet (30 meters).\n|SZ||surface zero||37°10’36.5”N 116°02’47.0”W\n|DOB||depth of burst||635 feet\n|Da||apparent depth||320 feet\n|Dal||depth from the lip crest||340–420 feet\n|Hal||height of the lip crest from the original ground surface||20–100 feet\nAverage 33 feet (__ meters)\n|Ra||apparent radius||1,200 feet\n|Ral||radius to crater lip crest|\n|Re||radius of ejecta|\nThe exact percentage of escaping radioactivity could not be obtained from the available preliminary data, but there was no major deviation from the prediction. The dust cloud carried the small amount of radioactivity which was not trapped underground or deposited close to the crater north at a speed of about 12 miles per hour. The fallout was in line predictions.\nCrater from the 1962 “Sedan” nuclear test as part of Operation Plowshare. The 104 kiloton blast displaced 12 million US tons (10.9 million metric tons) of earth and created a crater 320 feet (98 meters) deep and 1,200 feet (366 meters) wide.

Many other craters are visible in the image.\nTaking a Tour of the Sedan Crater\nYes! You can take a tour of the Sedan Crater and the rest of the Nevada National Security Site. The National Nuclear Security Administration’s Nevada Field Office provides free general interest tours of the Nevada National Security Site on a monthly basis.\nMost tours depart from the National Atomic Testing Museum at 755 E. Flamingo Road, Las Vegas, Nevada. Tours depart at approximately 7:30 a.m. and return at 4:00 p.m. Provided transportation is usually a chartered bus equipped with a restroom.\nThe Nevada National Security Site is located 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. Each tour usually covers about 250 miles. Tour participants should bring their own food and drinks, but no alcoholic beverages. There are no lunch stops. Casual clothing is recommended, and sturdy shoes are required for the rugged terrain. No shorts or sandals are permitted. Visitors to the Nevada National Security Site must be at least 14 years old. Pregnant women are discouraged from participating in Nevada National Security Site tours because of the long bus ride and uneven terrain.\nPoints of interest on the tour include:\n- Mercury, Nevada — Mercury is a closed city 65 miles (105 km) northwest of Las Vegas. It is situated within the Nevada Test Site and was constructed by the Atomic Energy Commission to house and service the staff of the test site.\n- Frenchman Flat — On January 27, 1951, the first atmospheric nuclear test, Able, took place on the Nevada National Security Site.\n- Nonproliferation Test and Evaluation Complex (NPTEC) — The NPTEC is the world’s largest facility for open-air testing of hazardous materials and biological simulants.\n- Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Site — There is a low-level waste storage pit at the Nevada National Security Site.\n- Sedan Crater\n- T-1 Training Area — The soil emits low levels of radiation, simulating widespread radiological contamination from Improvised Nuclear Devices (INDs) or multiple Radiological Dispersal Devices (RDDs or “dirty bombs”), yet posing minimal risk to participants.\n- Apple II Houses — In an effort to determine the seismic effects of low yield atomic tests, three “typical American homes” were built down range from the May 5, 1955 Apple II test of 29 kilotons.\nContact the Department of Energy’s Office of Public Affairs to find out the date of the next tour. (All 2016 tours have been filled.) Reservations are required for all tours. Space is limited and seats fill quickly.

But the planet has not always been so lucky.\nEarth\'s craters are enduring testaments to direct asteroid hits. And though millions—in some cases billions—of years of erosion have made it difficult to determine the exact size of the meteorites, there is a general scientific consensus around the world\'s largest craters, which mark the largest asteroid impacts.\nHere are the ten biggest known:\n1. Vredefort Crater\nAsteroid impact date: Estimated 2 billion years ago\nLocation: Free State, South Africa\nSpecs: Also known as the Vredefort Dome, the Vredefort crater has an estimated radius of 118 miles (190 kilometers), making it the world\'s largest known impact structure. This crater was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005.\n2. Sudbury Basin\nAsteroid impact date: Estimated 1.8 billion years ago\nLocation: Ontario, Canada\nSpecs: The Sudbury Basin is considered one of largest impact structures on Earth, with an estimated diameter of 81 miles (130 kilometers). Dating back 1.8 billion years, it is also one of the oldest known impact structures in the world.\n3. Acraman Crater\nAsteroid impact date: Estimated 580 million years ago\nLocation: South Australia, Australia\nSpecs: Located in what is now Lake Acraman, this impact structure has an estimated diameter of 56 miles (90 kilometers).\n4. Woodleigh Crater\nAsteroid impact date: Estimated 364 million years ago\nLocation: Western Australia, Australia\nSpecs: This crater is not exposed at the surface and has led to many discrepancies regarding its actual size. Reports on its diameter vary from 25 to 75 miles (40 to 120 kilometers).\n5. Manicouagan Crater\nAsteroid impact date: Estimated 215 million years ago\nLocation: Quebec, Canada\nSpecs: This impact crater formed what is now Lake Manicouagan. Even with erosion, it\'s considered one of the largest and best-preserved craters on Earth, with an estimated diameter of 62 miles (100 kilometers).\n6. Morokweng Crater\nAsteroid impact date: Estimated 145 million years ago\nLocation: North West, South Africa\nSpecs: Located near the Kalahari Desert in South Africa, this crater contained the fossilized remains of the meteorite that created it.\n7. Kara Crater\nAsteroid impact date: Estimated 70.3 million years ago\nLocation: Nenetsia, Russia\nSpecs: Now greatly eroded, the Kara crater is a non-exposed impact structure in Russia. Some have claimed that the impact structure actually consists of two adjacent craters: the Kara and the Ust-Kara crater.\n8. Chicxulub Crater\nAsteroid impact date: Estimated 65 million years ago\nLocation: Yucatán, Mexico\nSpecs: Located on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, many scientists believe that the meteorite that left this crater caused or contributed to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Estimates of its actual diameter range from 106 to a whooping 186 miles (170 to 300 kilometers), which if proved right could mean it\'s the biggest.\n9. Popigai Crater\nAsteroid impact date: Estimated 35.7 million years ago\nLocation: Siberia, Russia\nSpecs: Russian scientists claim that this crater site contains trillions of carats of diamonds, making it one of the largest diamond deposits in the world. These diamonds have been referred to as ""impact diamonds.""\n10. Chesapeake Bay Crater\nAsteroid impact date: Estimated 35 million years ago\nLocation: Virginia, United States\nSpecs: Discovered in the early 1980s, the Chesapeake Bay Crater is located approximately 125 miles (201 kilometers) from Washington, D.C. Some estimates suggest this crater is 53 miles (85 kilometers) wide.']"	['<urn:uuid:4264b702-aa39-4c2d-98b9-ffb7338231d7>', '<urn:uuid:6fca65ec-a152-42c6-be41-37306712d996>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	17	51	1844
14	misiconi dance company netherlands what do they do inclusive dance	Misiconi Dance Company, based in Rotterdam, is an integrated dance company focused on three main areas: the dance company itself, a Knowledge Centre, and a Creative Community Hub. Founded in 2015, they work to provide opportunities for everyone to develop their talents, access high-quality training, and perform. The company aims to achieve artistic exchange, integration, communication, and collaboration between young talented artists through dance and performance.	['We hope you will find it relevant, interesting and enlightening.\nThe idea for the project first started developing in Jan 2018. I had led Northern Ballet’s Ability for over 5 years and felt I needed some new input. Mia (Support Artist) and I always spend a fair bit of time reflecting on what happens in the sessions; individual’s progress, why things are working (or not) and how we can improve or change what we do to develop their skills further. However, there comes a point when you need some outside expertise. Or just the chance to see how others are approaching common issues.\nHypermobility and how to work with it safely was, and is, an ongoing concern. The majority of our dancers display it which affects their alignment, ability to build and maintain strength, and increases risk of injury amongst many other things. We also often wonder how effectively we’re communicating with our dancers. Is the idea or concept clear? Or can we approach it in another way? How can we enable them to develop their technical dance skills so they can reach their full potential as expressive artists?\nSo we decided to create a project that would address these needs. We had a small window of time to apply for Erasmus + funding and within that we needed to find two European partners, some Dance Science and Education specialists, work out what a project that answered these questions would look like and write a (very long) application. All in under 8 weeks. Thankfully we were successful! Stopgap Dance Company helped us find some brilliant partners (thank you!) and Wendy Timmons and Mark Pace from the University of Edinburgh came on board.\nHere’s some information about the dance companies involved to start. Please keep revisiting to find out more about the project and how it’s progressing…\nTeam UK – Northern Ballet\nNorthern Ballet is the busiest touring ballet company in the UK, creating full length ballets, children’s ballets and a range of digital work with a strong focus on the narrative. We believe in the value of creating a diverse range of ballets which appeal to as many people as possible, from all walks of life and we constantly seek to engage new audiences. Our Learning team work with people and communities who face a range of barriers which may prevent them from benefiting from the arts and in 2016/17 we worked with 58,843 people of all ages and abilities across the UK.\nSince 2012, we have delivered ‘Ability’, a weekly dance course for adults with a mild to moderate learning disability with the aim of developing the participants technical and creative dance skills while meeting social and developmental needs. The group perform locally, regionally and nationally.\nAbility is led by Sophie Alder with Mia Nielson as support artist.\nTeam Netherlands – Misiconi Dance Company\nMisiconi Dance Company is an integrated dance company based in Rotterdam. The company has continued to grow over the last three years. It was founded in 2015 by Joop Oonk and has already pioneering methods of working inclusively in the Netherlands and beyond. The young company delivering its mission with enthusiasm. According to Joop “everyone should have the opportunity to develop their talents, access high quality training, and perform”.\nMisiconi focuses on three strands: Misiconi Dance Company, Knowledge Centre and Creative Community Hub makes the company unique in its inclusive artistic vision. Learning, creativity, artistic practice and research goes hand in hand while seeking new opportunities for development. Misiconi aims to achieve artistic exchange, integration, communication and collaboration between young talented artists through dance and performance.\nThe company is led by Joop Oonk, artistic director and overall dance practitioner, supported by Manouk Schrauwen as education manager and overall dance practitioner.\nTeam Spain – Psico Ballet Maite Leon Foundation\nPsico Ballet Maite Leon Foundation (PBMLF) is a Spanish non-profit private foundation which was created in 1986 by Maite Leon, a dancer, choreographer and mother of a daughter with a learning disability. Their work is focused on the complete scenic training of people with physical, intellectual, developmental or sensory disabilities through their own methodology which is registered as ‘Psico Ballet Maite Leon Method’. This methodology involves dance, theatre, circus, music, voice and scenic makeup classes, for the complete formation of an actor-dancer with disabilities. Through this method, the students acquire a positive perception of themselves, self-motivation, initiative, perseverance, responsibility, autonomy and teamwork among other objectives.\nThe FPBML wishes to share its approach and learn about other artistic and teaching proposals with other European partners to raise and deepen the profile and purpose of inclusive dance. The FPBML has three artistic companies: School company, Psico Ballet company and Fritsch Company, which is their professional company (seeks for professional scenic employment of its 16 members) and travels on tour around the world performing in festivals and professional circuits.\nThose responsible for the entity in the SHIFT project! They are Gabriela Martín, current director of the FPBML and Ramón Marcos, dancer, teacher and choreographer.\n“I love participating in this project in which we can exchange and share methodologies with other companies, expand our own knowledge and create work tools for teachers and artists who want to be part of this process.”\n“I feel very grateful and fortunate to participate in such an enriching project and with a team of highly qualified professionals since it gives me different perspectives of work and it is very enriching to be able to develop and create each one of the parts of the project in a cooperative way.”\nTop image: Joop & Ruben']	['<urn:uuid:d246c539-190b-47aa-943c-63496081eb1f>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	10	66	929
15	I'm developing spray coating processes for industrial applications and I'd like to know how the HVOF (High Velocity Oxy Fuel) spray process works in terms of its basic operating principles?	In the HVOF process, liquid fuel and oxygen are fed at high pressure into a combustion chamber through a pre-mixing system. They burn to produce hot, high pressure gas which is expanded through a laval type nozzle. This increases the gas velocity to around 1,500 m/sec and raises the pressure to slightly above atmospheric. At this point, powder can be easily injected into the gas stream.

The molten material is atomised by\ncompressed air and propelled towards the workpiece.\n- Flame Spray - In\nthe Flamespray process, the raw material in the form of a single wire, cord or\npowder, is melted in an oxygen-fuel gas flame. This molten material is atomised\nby a cone of compressed air and propelled towards the workpiece.\n- Plasma Spray -\nWhen Plasmaspraying, the plasma is created by an electric arc burning within the\nnozzle of a plasma gun. The arc gas is formed into a plasma jet as it emerges\nfrom the gun nozzle. Powder particles are injected into this jet where they melt\nand then strike the surface at high velocity to produce a strongly adherent\ncoating. Almost any material can be sprayed including metals, ceramics and\nplastics. The workpiece remains cool because the plasma is localised at the gun.\n- HVOF - Liquid fuel\nand oxygen are fed via a pre-mixing system and at high pressure into a\ncombustion chamber where they burn to produce a hot, high pressure gas stream.\nThis is expanded through a laval type nozzle increasing the gas velocity to\naround 1,500 m/sec and the pressure to slightly above atmospheric. At this stage\nthe powder can easily be injected into the gas stream.\n- Metal Spray Suppliers -\n- Metalizing Current State of the\nArt - Metalizing"" is a term applied to pure metal sprayed coats\n(not paint) as opposed to other methods of applying metallic coatings such as\nhot dip galvanizing or electroplating. Metalizing equipment is mobile,\nappropriate for many complex shapes and not limited by size. Metalizing may be\nused alone or in combination with other coating systems, and drastically\nincreases the adhesion of topcoats when they are applied over metalized\ncoatings. A wide variety of materials can be safely and effectively metalized\nincluding: metal, concrete, glass, plastic, fiberglass, wood, paper, and cloth.\n- Metal Spraying of Zinc and\nAluminum in the United Kingdom -A wide range of industries in the United\nKingdom have used zinc and aluminum spraying for the corrosion protection of\neither mass produced articles or individual structures. Those reported include\nmany which can still be seen as case histories demonstrating the long life\npossible. Zinc spraying of plastics, impregnated asbestos, and\nnon-metallic substrates (such as paper in electrical capacitors) is widely used\nto provide electrical conductivity or electromagnetic screening properties of\nreflective surfaces. Meanwhile, zinc or tin-zinc spraying is used in the\nproduction of moulds and mould tools for the plastics industry.\nCoatings - We apply each of the three major types of spray,\nincluding the recently- developed high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) process.The\nthree types are; Spray-and-Fuse, Plasma Spray, and HVOF:\n- Nickel-base spray-and-fuse coatings, although developed\nover fifty years ago, are still specified by many of our customers because they\nare reliable, inexpensive, and they perform very well in service. These coatings\nare a special alloy of nickel, chromium, silicon, boron, and carbon. Their major\nattribute, in addition to their excellent resistance to galling and abrasive\nwear, is that their melting point is only about two thousand degrees\nFahrenheit. This means that they can be sprayed onto a steel component\n(which melts at about twenty seven hundred degrees Fahrenheit) , and then\nsubsequently fused, or melted, without melting the base metal.\n- The plasma spray process was developed in the 1950\'s as an\noff-shoot of the rocket industry. The process was developed to enable aerospace\nengineers to spray-form non-metallic nose cones. The plasma spray gun is\nbasically a welding torch into which spray powder is introduced. The expansion\nof the inert gases passing through the gun accelerates the spray powder toward\nthe target. The arc temperature of the plasma torch approaches 30,000 degrees\nKelvin, which is sufficient to soften even the most high-melting materials. This\nprocess is used to apply high-melting materials such as chromium oxide, aluminum\noxide, and titanium oxide.\nCorrosion.Com : Protective Paints, Coatings, Linings &\nCorrosion Information Server\nLos Alamos National Laboratory: Electrotechnologies for Your\nHome - The art of metal-forming; technology brings life to\n- Scientists at Los Alamos National Laborator, Los Alamos, N.M. have adapted a\nmetal forming technology with origins in the Cold War for a new application in\nthe art world.\n- Big, metal yard sculptures comprise a growing trend among sculptors and\ntheir enthusiasts.

16	advanced mountain climber route conditions weather different seasons danger factors	Mountain climbing conditions vary significantly across seasons. Spring sees higher precipitation, while summer can have temperatures in the 90s with common afternoon thunderstorms. Autumn typically offers the most reliable conditions. Winter can provide good climbing weather but is unpredictable due to potential snowstorms and cold fronts. Key danger factors include steep and possibly wet meadows, rock scrambling with Class 4 moves (and potential hidden Class 5 sections), and avalanche risks. For safety in avalanche terrain, it's crucial to consider mountain weather, snow surface conditions, and snow profiles. Weather-related hazards include afternoon thundershowers, particularly in summer, which require early starts and proper preparation including rain gear and appropriate layered clothing.	"['ApproachFor the driving approach to the start point, see the Northwest Approach on the main page. You should expect about half-an-hour of driving to get to the start point from Hwy-530. The nice thing is, if it\'s summer time, you\'ll be gaining over 3,000 ft on the drive. ""Trailhead"" starts of over 4,000 ft on the west side of the Cascades are not common so you should take advantage of them when you can.\nRoute DescriptionFrom the beginning of the spur road (c. 4,060 ft), walk the spur south for about 10 minutes as it descends slightly along the west flank of Illabot. The road is not shown on maps. At the second log pile (c. 3,940 ft), leave the road and enter the forest on the left.\nClimb obliquely up and right through mostly open forest, aiming for the meadow (c. 4,500 ft) WNW of Pt. 5603. A small stream tumbles through this inclined meadow. Continue up and right to another meadow with a rock wall on its upper-right end. Go south in the meadow and make for the west spur of Pt. 5603 where the contours are flatter (c. 4,900 ft). From there, climb up and right (some rocks to deal with in the forest) to get to the next meadow (c. 5,200 ft) south of Pt. 5603. Bear right (east) in the meadow, right of a cliff, to a mossy/grassy ramp that leads up to the ridge crest at ~5,440 ft. Once on the crest, turn left (uphill) and ascend open terrain to just before Pt. 5600. You do not have to climb to the top of Pt. 5600. Instead, begin contouring right to the saddle between it and the main summit. The saddle has some small gendarmes in it so you may be forced to the south side.\nWest Ridge CompletionWhen the ridge toward the main summit finally steepens and exfoliates a few hundred feet below the top, trend down and right to a short dirt traverse/gully leading to snags (dead scrub pines) at the south foot of the buttress. Possibly a small cairn here. Step over the snags then cross another depression eastward for 40 feet (look for a piece of orange flagging in this depression) to a diminutive rock crest with a deep south-draining gully on the other side. Go left (upward) and do one Class 4 step (two moves) or possibly take a ledge into the gully (unpleasant tree bushwhack in the gully). From the step, climb up 20-30 more feet to a small buttress. You can go right into the gully but it involves another uncertain move. Instead, go left (west) around the buttress back up to the ridge crest. Turn right (east) and scramble over rocks and through trees to the final notch (the top of the deep gully). Now, a wide ledge can be taken rightward from the notch to the south side of the final summit, which is now only 20 vertical feet above you. From the summit, the completion from the end of this ledge looked to entail a little bit of Class 4. There is a route to the left from the notch. It leads to a slabby depression on the NW side of summit. Climb the Class 4 slabs for 15 feet (small foot and fingerhold ledges on slabs). The rest is easy to the top. Reverse the route on the return.\nTime: 3 hours from car give or take an hour depending on route-finding success\nGain: 2000 ft\nDifficulty: Some steep forest; some steep and possibly wet meadow; rock scrambling with a few Class 4 moves but beware of lurking Class 5\nEssential GearA helmet might be nice if climbing with others\nIce axe in early season\nCrampons if icy.

Please call ahead for availability.\nConditions can be favorable for climbing at nearly any point during the year, but for most objectives, better climbing conditions occur in spring, summer, and autumn. Spring has a higher likelihood of precipitation. Summer afternoon temperatures can climb into the 90’s and isolated afternoon thunderstorms are common. In the autumn, climbers tend to find the most reliable conditions. Winter has many spells of great climbing weather, but it is difficult to plan in advance, as the Front Range can also receive full Rocky Mountain snowstorms and cold fronts.

17	I design power supplies and am looking into different rectifier efficiencies. What are the key performance characteristics and limitations of half-wave rectifiers compared to full-wave bridge rectifiers in terms of output voltage and efficiency?	Half-wave rectifiers are significantly less efficient than full-wave bridge rectifiers. A half-wave rectifier has an efficiency of only 40.6% and wastes approximately half of the applied voltage since it only uses one half-cycle. Its output DC voltage is about 0.637 of the maximum input voltage, with a high ripple factor of 1.21 (121% of DC magnitude), indicating poor AC to DC conversion efficiency. In contrast, a full-wave bridge rectifier is 100% efficient as it utilizes both half-cycles, producing an output voltage that's also 0.637Vmax but with much less ripple, creating a smoother output waveform. The bridge rectifier achieves this using four diodes in a bridge configuration, with two diodes conducting during each half-cycle, though it does introduce a voltage drop of about 1.4V (2 diode drops) in the output.	['Half wave rectifier\nA rectifier is a simple diode or group of diodes. It converts the Alternating Current (AC) to Direct Current (DC). A diode allows electric current passes in one direction. And blocks in another direction. By using this principle we have to construct various types of rectifiers.\nThe rectifiers are classified into different groups and types. it based on the number of diodes used in the circuit. It also depends on the arrangement of diodes in the circuit. The two basic types of rectifiers are as follow;\n- Half wave rectifier\n- What is Full-wave rectifier\nIn this, we only discuss half-wave rectification.\nHalf wave rectifier definition\nA half-wave rectifier is a device.It converts the half cycle of the input signal into a pulsating DC output signal. or A half-wave rectifier is a type of rectifier which allows only a positive half cycle. the input alternating current signal while blocked another half cycle. For example, the positive half cycle is allowed to pass. Then the negative half cycle is blocked. Similarly, if the negative half cycle is allowed to pass. Then the positive half cycle is blocked. However, a half-wave rectifier does not allow both half-cycles. Therefore, the half-cycle either is positive or negative. The input signal is wasted.\nWhat is a half-wave rectifier?\nIt is the simplest form of the rectifier. In it, we use only a single diode. In the construction of the half-wave rectifier. It is made up of an AC source. like diode, transformer, and resistor. So in it, the diode is placed, between the transformer and the resistor.\nThe AC source supplies AC to the circuit.\nThe transformer is an electronic device. It increases or decreases the AC voltage.\nThere are two types of transformer\n- Step-up transformer\n- Stepdown transformer\nIn the step-up transformer, the AC voltage goes too high values. the low voltage is produced at the secondary winding. In the step-down transformer, the AC voltage is low. Generally, we use a step-down transformer in the half-wave rectifier. Because we needed a very small amount of the voltage.\nWhen we apply a large AC voltage without using a transformer. We permanently destroy the diode. So we use a step-down transformer. In the half-wave rectifier. In the step-down transformer, the turns in the primary winding greater.\nThe turns in the secondary winding are lesser. the voltage decreases in the step-down transformer. From the primary winding to secondary winding.\nA diode is a device having two terminals. It allows flowing an electric current in one direction. It blocks the current in the opposite direction.\nA resistor is an electronic component. It resists the flow of current to a certain level.\nHalf wave rectifier operation\nPositive half wave rectifier\nIn it, high voltage reduces into low value. The step-down transformer reduces the high voltage to its low voltage. The AC signal applied to the transformer.\nNegative half wave rectifier\nThe working principle of negative half-wave and positive half-wave rectifiers are almost the same. Here we only change the direction of a diode. The step-down transformer, the high voltage reduces to its low value. This type of diode in which we applied the low value of voltage. In the negative half cycle, the diode is working as forward-biased. And in the positive half cycle, the diode is working as reverse biased.', 'Half wave Rectifier\nA rectifier is nothing but a simple diode or group of diodes which converts the Alternating Current (AC) into Direct Current (DC).We know that a diode allows electric current in one direction and blocks electric current in another direction. We are using this principle to construct various types of rectifiers. Rectifiers are classified into different types based on the number of diodes used in the circuit or arrangement of diodes in the circuit. The basic types of rectifiers are: half wave rectifier and full wave rectifier.\nHalf wave rectifier definition\nA half wave rectifier is a type of rectifier which converts the positive half cycle (positive current) of the input signal into pulsating DC (Direct Current) output signal.\nA half wave rectifier is a type of rectifier which allows only half cycle (either positive half cycle or negative half cycle) of the input AC signal while another half cycle is blocked.\nFor example, if the positive half cycle is allowed then the negative half cycle is blocked. Similarly, if the negative half cycle is allowed then the positive half cycle is blocked. However, a half wave rectifier will not allow both positive and negative half cycles at the same time.\nTherefore, the half cycle (either positive or negative) of the input signal is wasted.\nWhat is half wave rectifier?\nThe half wave rectifier is the simplest form of the rectifier. We use only a single diode to construct the half wave rectifier.\nThe half wave rectifier is made up of an AC source, transformer (step-down), diode, and resistor (load). The diode is placed between the transformer and resistor (load).\nThe AC source supplies Alternating Current to the circuit. The alternating current is often represented by a sinusoidal waveform.\nHalf wave rectifier operation\nWhen high AC voltage (60 Hz) is applied, the step-down transformer reduces this high voltage into low voltage. Thus, a low voltage is produced at the secondary winding of the transformer. The low voltage produced at the secondary winding of the transformer is called secondary voltage (VS). The AC voltage or AC signal applied to the transformer is nothing but an input AC signal or input AC voltage.\nThe low AC voltage produced by the step-down transformer is directly applied to the diode.\nWhen low AC voltage is applied to the diode (D), during the positive half cycle of the signal, the diode is forward biased and allows electric current whereas, during the negative half cycle, the diode is reverse biased and blocks electric current. In simple words, the diode allows the positive half-cycle of the input AC signal and blocks the negative half-cycle of the input AC signal.\nThe positive half-cycle of the input AC signal or AC voltage applied to the diode is analogous to the forward DC voltage applied to the p-n junction diode similarly the negative half-cycle of the input AC signal applied to the diode is analogous to the reverse DC voltage applied to the p-n junction diode.\nWe know that diode allows electric current when it is forward biased and blocks electric current when it is reverse biased. Similarly, in an AC circuit, the diode allows electric current during the positive half cycle (forward biased) and blocks electric current during the negative half cycle (reverse biased).\nThe positive half wave rectifier does not completely block the negative half cycles. It allows a small portion of negative half cycles or small negative current. This current is produced by the minority carriers in the diode.\nThe current produced by the minority carriers is very small. So it is neglected. We can’t visually see the small portion of negative half cycles at the output.\nIn an ideal diode, the negative half cycles or negative current is zero.\nThe resistor placed at the output consumes the DC current generated by the diode. Hence, the resistor is also known as an electrical load. The output DC voltage or DC current is measured across the load resistor RL.\nThe electrical load is nothing but an electrical component of a circuit that consumes electric current. In half wave rectifier, the resistor consumes the DC current generated by the diode. So the resistor in half wave rectifier is known as a load.\nSometimes, the load is also refers to the power consumed by the circuit.\nThe load resistors are used in half wave rectifiers to restrict or block the unusual excess DC current produced by the diode.\nThus, the half wave rectifier allows positive half cycles and blocks negative half cycles. The half wave rectifier which allows positive half cycles and blocks negative half cycles is called a positive half wave rectifier. The output DC current or DC signal produced by a positive half wave rectifier is a series of positive half cycles or positive sinusoidal pulses.\nNow let’s take a look at the negative half wave rectifier……..\nNegative half wave rectifier\nThe construction and working of negative half wave rectifier is almost similar to the positive half wave rectifier. The only thing we change here is the direction of a diode.\nWhen AC voltage is applied, the step-down transformer reduces the high voltage to low voltage. This low voltage is applied to the diode.\nUnlike the positive half wave rectifier, the negative half wave rectifier allows electric current during the negative half-cycle of input AC signal and blocks electric current during the positive half-cycle of the input AC signal.\nDuring the negative half cycle, the diode is forward biased and during the positive half cycle the diode is reverse biased, so the negative half wave rectifier allows electric current only during the negative half cycle.\nThus, the negative half wave rectifier allows negative half cycles and blocks positive half cycles.\nThe negative half wave rectifier does not completely block the positive half cycles. It allows a small portion of positive half cycles or small positive current. This current is produced by the minority carriers in the diode.\nThe current produced by the minority carriers is very small. So it is neglected. We can’t visually see this small positive half cycles at the output.\nIn an ideal diode, the positive half cycle or positive current is zero.\nThe DC current or DC voltage produced by the negative half wave rectifier is measured across the load resistor RL. The output DC current or DC signal produced by a negative half wave rectifier is a series of negative half cycles or negative sinusoidal pulses.\nThus, a negative half wave rectifier produces a series of negative sinusoidal pulses.\nIn a perfect or ideal diode, the positive half cycle or negative half cycle at the output is exactly same as the input positive half cycle or negative half cycle. However, in practice, the positive half cycle or negative half cycle at the output is slightly different from the input positive half cycle or negative half cycle. But this difference is negligible. So we can’t see the difference with our eyes.\nThus, the half wave rectifier produces a series of positive sinusoidal pulses or negative sinusoidal pulses. This series of positive pulses or negative pulses is not a pure direct current. It is a pulsating direct current.\nThe pulsating direct current changes its value over a short period of time. But our aim is to produce a direct current which does not change its value over a short period of time. Therefore, the pulsating direct current is not much useful.\nHalf wave rectifier with capacitor filter\nA filter converts the pulsating direct current into pure direct current. In half wave rectifiers, a capacitor or inductor is used as a filter to convert the pulsating DC to pure DC.\nThe output voltage produced by a half wave rectifier is not constant; it varies with respect to time. In practical applications, a constant DC supply voltage is needed.\nIn order to produce a constant DC voltage, we need to suppress the ripples of a DC voltage. This can be achieved by using either a capacitor filter or inductor filter at the output side. In the below circuit, we are using the capacitor filter. The capacitor placed at the output side smoothen the pulsating DC to pure DC.\nCharacteristics of half wave rectifier\nThe direct current (DC) produced by a half wave rectifier is not a pure DC but a pulsating DC. In the output pulsating DC signal, we find ripples. These ripples in the output DC signal can be reduced by using filters such capacitors and inductors.\nIn order to measure how much ripples are there in the output DC signal we use a factor known as ripple factor. The ripple factor is denoted by γ.\nThe ripple factor tells us the amount of ripples present in the output DC signal.\nA large ripple factor indicates a high pulsating DC signal while a low ripple factor indicates a low pulsating DC signal.\nIf the ripple factor is very low then it indicates that the output DC current is closer to the pure DC current. In simple words, the lower the ripple factor the smoother the output DC signal.\nRipple factor can be mathematically defined as the ratio of rms value of AC component of the output voltage to the DC component of the output voltage.\nRipples factor = rms value of AC component of the output voltage / DC component of the output voltage\nWhere, rms = root mean square\nThe ripple factor is also simply defined as the ratio of ripple voltage to the DC voltage\nRipple factor = Ratio of ripple voltage / DC voltage\nThe ripple factor should be kept as minimum as possible to construct a good rectifier.\nThe ripple factor is given as\nFinally, we get\nγ = 1.21\nThe unwanted ripple present in the output along with the DC voltage is 121% of the DC magnitude. This indicates that the half wave rectifier is not an efficient AC to DC converter. The high ripples in the half wave rectifier can be reduced by using filters.\nThe DC current is given by,\nImax = maximum DC load current\nOutput DC voltage (VDC)\nThe output DC voltage (VDC) is the voltage appeared at the load resistor (RL). This voltage is obtained by multiplying the output DC current with load resistance RL.\nIt can be mathematically written as,\nVDC = IDC RL\nThe output DC voltage is given by,\nWhere, VSmax = Maximum secondary voltage\nPeak inverse voltage (PIV)\nPeak inverse voltage is the maximum reverse bias voltage up to which a diode can withstand. If the applied voltage is greater than the peak inverse voltage, the diode will be destroyed.\nDuring the positive half cycle, the diode is forward biased and allow electric current. This current is dropped at the resistor load (RL). However, during the negative half cycle, the diode is reverse biased and does not allows electric current, so the input AC current or AC voltage is dropped at the diode.\nThe maximum voltage dropped at the diode is nothing but an input voltage.\nTherefore, peak inverse voltage (PIV) of diode = VSmax\nRectifier efficiency is defined as the ratio of output DC power to the input AC power.\nThe rectifier efficiency of a half wave rectifier is 40.6%\nRoot mean square (RMS) value of load current IRMS\nThe root mean square (RMS) value of load current in a half wave rectifier is\nRoot mean square (RMS) value of output load voltage VRMS\nThe root mean square (RMS) value of output load voltage in a half wave rectifier is\nForm factor is defined as the ratio of RMS value to the DC value\nIt can be mathematically written as\nF.F = RMS value / DC value\nThe form factor of a half wave rectifier is\nF.F = 1.57\nAdvantages of half wave rectifier\n- We use very few components to construct the half wave rectifier. So the cost is very low.\n- Easy to construct\nDisadvantages of half wave rectifier\n- Power loss\nThe half wave rectifier either allows the positive half cycle or negative half cycle. So the remaining half cycle is wasted. Approximately half of the applied voltage is wasted in half wave rectifier.\n- Pulsating direct current\nThe direct current produced by the half wave rectifier is not a pure direct current; it is a pulsating direct current which is not much useful.\n- Produces low output voltage.\nFull Wave Rectifier\nLike the half wave circuit, a full wave rectifier circuit produces an output voltage or current which is purely DC or has some specified DC component. Full wave rectifiers have some fundamental advantages over their half wave rectifier counterparts. The average (DC) output voltage is higher than for half wave, the output of the full wave rectifier has much less ripple than that of the half wave rectifier producing a smoother output waveform.\nIn a Full Wave Rectifier circuit two diodes are now used, one for each half of the cycle. A multiple winding transformer is used whose secondary winding is split equally into two halves with a common centre tapped connection, (C). This configuration results in each diode conducting in turn when its anode terminal is positive with respect to the transformer centre point C producing an output during both half-cycles, twice that for the half wave rectifier so it is 100% efficient as shown below.\nFull Wave Rectifier Circuit\nThe full wave rectifier circuit consists of two power diodes connected to a single load resistance (RL) with each diode taking it in turn to supply current to the load. When point A of the transformer is positive with respect to point C, diode D1 conducts in the forward direction as indicated by the arrows.\nWhen point B is positive (in the negative half of the cycle) with respect to point C, diode D2 conducts in the forward direction and the current flowing through resistor R is in the same direction for both half-cycles. As the output voltage across the resistor R is the phasor sum of the two waveforms combined, this type of full wave rectifier circuit is also known as a “bi-phase” circuit.\nPartsim Simulation Waveform\nAs the spaces between each half-wave developed by each diode is now being filled in by the other diode the average DC output voltage across the load resistor is now double that of the single half-wave rectifier circuit and is about 0.637Vmax of the peak voltage, assuming no losses.\nWhere: VMAX is the maximum peak value in one half of the secondary winding and VRMS is the rms value.\nThe peak voltage of the output waveform is the same as before for the half-wave rectifier provided each half of the transformer windings have the same rms voltage value. To obtain a different DC voltage output different transformer ratios can be used.\nThe main disadvantage of this type of full wave rectifier circuit is that a larger transformer for a given power output is required with two separate but identical secondary windings making this type of full wave rectifying circuit costly compared to the “Full Wave Bridge Rectifier” circuit equivalent.\nThe Full Wave Bridge Rectifier\nAnother type of circuit that produces the same output waveform as the full wave rectifier circuit above, is that of the Full Wave Bridge Rectifier. This type of single phase rectifier uses four individual rectifying diodes connected in a closed loop “bridge” configuration to produce the desired output.\nThe main advantage of this bridge circuit is that it does not require a special centre tapped transformer, thereby reducing its size and cost. The single secondary winding is connected to one side of the diode bridge network and the load to the other side as shown below.\nThe Diode Bridge Rectifier\nThe four diodes labelled D1 to D4 are arranged in “series pairs” with only two diodes conducting current during each half cycle. During the positive half cycle of the supply, diodes D1 and D2 conduct in series while diodes D3 and D4 are reverse biased and the current flows through the load as shown below.\nThe Positive Half-cycle\nDuring the negative half cycle of the supply, diodes D3 and D4 conduct in series, but diodes D1 and D2 switch “OFF” as they are now reverse biased. The current flowing through the load is the same direction as before.\nThe Negative Half-cycle\nAs the current flowing through the load is unidirectional, so the voltage developed across the load is also unidirectional the same as for the previous two diode full-wave rectifier, therefore the average DC voltage across the load is 0.637Vmax.\nHowever in reality, during each half cycle the current flows through two diodes instead of just one so the amplitude of the output voltage is two voltage drops ( 2*0.7 = 1.4V ) less than the input VMAX amplitude. The ripple frequency is now twice the supply frequency (e.g. 100Hz for a 50Hz supply or 120Hz for a 60Hz supply.)\nAlthough we can use four individual power diodes to make a full wave bridge rectifier, pre-made bridge rectifier components are available “off-the-shelf” in a range of different voltage and current sizes that can be soldered directly into a PCB circuit board or be connected by spade connectors.\nThe image to the right shows a typical single phase bridge rectifier with one corner cut off. This cut-off corner indicates that the terminal nearest to the corner is the positive or +ve output terminal or lead with the opposite (diagonal) lead being the negative or -ve output lead. The other two connecting leads are for the input alternating voltage from a transformer secondary winding.']	['<urn:uuid:d16e00e0-cf5d-4953-84f6-d2f057ad1251>', '<urn:uuid:a72c4f2f-fe6a-43cc-969d-9cbf7ac0ce9b>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	34	129	3487
18	vessel preservation security pwht benefits	For vessel preservation, layup procedures help maintain vessel structure and machinery by protecting against corrosion while providing round-the-clock security. Meanwhile, PWHT offers three main benefits: tempering, relaxation of residual stresses, and hydrogen removal, which improve dimensional stability, ductility toughness, and corrosion resistance.	['Due to the recent down turn in the global economy there is an over-supply of commercial ships on the market that is driving single voyage and charter rates down to the point where it is not cost effective for an Owner to operate. As such Owners are looking for places to anchor their vessels where simple layup procedures can be implemented to preserve the condition of their vessels until the economy picks up again.\nThe objective is to offer Owners a secure and alternative location to Singapore OPL Western and Eastern Anchorage, away from the major shipping lanes, but still be within close proximity to offer the excellent support and network from Shipyards and Contractors that exist in the region.\nALL VESSELS ACCEPTED\nBDP caters to all types of vessels including oil tankers, LNG carriers (both Moss and membrane type ships), drill ships, cable ships, container ships and (floating production, storage and offshore loading structures). We are able to tailor the lay-up to suit owner and vessel requirements, so ensuring vessels are returned in optimum condition.\nScope of Services\nIn accordance with recommendations by major classification societies and flag states, preparation for lay up should preferably be carried out with the vessel’s crew as they are the ones who know their ship best. BGPL can however assist the whole work from arrival to the lay-up location.\nOnce the vessel is ready, Bias Delta Pratama will assist owner with and/or coordinate the following services – and more – through local providers.\n• A wide choice of vessel lay-up solutions, with thorough local knowledge.\n• Support with documentation to obtain permits from local authorities.\n• Safety and security advice.\n• Advice on the lay-up process including supply of procedures and checklists\n• Technical Management.\n• Routine maintenance and preservation.\n• Provision of machinery such as heaters, dehumidifiers and other equipment.\n• Regular monitoring of the vessel mooring and safe berth.\n• Round the clock security.\n• Comprehensive monthly reports to owners.\n• Crew management/crew supply.\n• Ship supply services.\n• Any other agency or logistics services as requested by the owner.\n• Assistance with efficient start-up after the lay-up period.\nLaying-up a ship is designed to:\n• Preserve and maintain the vessel structure and machinery by protecting against corrosion and static seizure.\n• Maintain the security, safety and protection of the vessel, crew and environment.\nThe extent to which a vessel will be laid-up depends on several factors, including: anticipated lay-up period duration; the need to reduce running costs; time required for reactivation’ and the age and value of the ship.\nLay Up Options\nBias Delta Pratama offers four different modes of lay-up:\n• Hot Term Lay-Up, Up to 3 months (H)\n• Warm Term Lay-Up, Up to 12 months (W)\n• Cold Term Lay-Up, Up to 5 years (C)\n• Long Term Lay-Up, term 5 plus years (L)\nHOT Lay Up: Suitable for up to 3 months out of service with 24 hour reactivation.\nIn this condition, the vessel is held within Classification and Flag State requirements, although crew numbers may be reduced to certified minimum safety manning limits. Machinery is kept operational but economies are made. The vessel is located in an area close to potential cargo trade routes.\nWarm Lay Up: Suitable for up to 12 months out of service with one week reactivation.\nIn this condition, vessel manning is reduced to below the trading limit and in agreement with the flag state, classification society, insurers and local authorities. Most ports will only grant a temporary permit to lay-up a vessel in this condition in port, provided that class and flag survey are conducted. There may be local restrictions on vessel operations such as restrictions the transfer of oily bilge water.\nCold Lay Up: Suitable for up to five years out of service with three week reactivation.\nIn this condition, vessel manning is in line with emergency requirements to deal with fire, flooding, mooring, and security watch. Upon reactivation, the vessel may need to go direct to dry dock before trading, depending on the extent of any hull marine growth. It is imperative that all preparations and processes during cold lay-up are well documented as crew changes may be significant.\nLong Term Lay Up: Suitable for up to more than five years out of service with three-month activation.\nIn this extended condition, preparations are comprehensive as original manufacturers are consulted for critical equipment, any remedial work done on reactivation is likely to be extensive and unpredictable, such as renewal of alarm systems that may have become obsolete. For long term lay ups, several vessels may be laid-up side by side to minimize supervision costs.\nBias Delta Pratama is aware of all these potential problems involved in lay-ups and has the experience, technical expertise and resources to avoid the pitfalls.\nFor full technical details please request for our services guidelines or mail to:', 'One of the most common applications of our heat treatment is for post weld heat treatment. Superheat FGH can provide post weld heat treatment to your specifications or consult you on the best post weld heat treatment process for your metallurgy and application.\nPost Weld Heat Treatment (in accordance with AWS D10.10M)\nPost Weld Heat Treatment is performed after welding, generally at a higher temperature and with different objectives than Preheat/Interpass heating. PWHT may need to be applied without allowing the temperature to drop below the specified minimum for Preheat/Interpass heating. So in short you may have to apply the PWHT method with the work piece at temperatures up to 600Â° F (316Â° C).\nLocal PWHT of carbon and low alloy steels is typically performed below the lower critical transformation temperature and is therefore referred to as subcritical. The lower and upper critical transformation temperatures indicate where the crystal structure of steel begins and finally completes a change from body centered cubic to face centered cubic upon heating (the reverse upon cooling). And what this is saying, the molecules of the alloy will rearrange them self to a different configuration if we allow the temperature to reach the upper critical transformation. That will cause the properties of the metal to change, such as hardness and ductility.\nThere are several reasons why local supercritical PWHT (above the upper critical transformation temperature) such as annealing or normalizing is not desirable. First and foremost, the temperature gradients inherent to local PWHT would produce subcritical, intercritical and supercritical temperature regions. Depending upon the prior heat treatment of the material, this could result in a detrimental effect upon properties (tensile/yield strength and impact toughness) and/or local inhomogeneity (irregularity).\nAdditionally, reduced material strength at supercritical temperatures creates a greater likelihood for distortion. For reasons relating to carbide precipitation and the need for rapid cooling, localized solution annealing of austenitic alloys such as 300 series stainless steels is also generally not desirable. The discussion of PWHT below and in other parts of the document refers to subcritical PWHT, unless otherwise noted.\nPost Weld Heat Treatment can have both beneficial and detrimental effects. Three primary benefits of PWHT are recognized. These are tempering, relaxation of residual stresses and hydrogen removal. Consequential benefits such as avoidance of hydrogen induced cracking, dimensional stability, and improved ductility toughness and corrosion resistance result from the primary benefits. It is important that PWHT conditions be determined based upon the desired objectives. With regard to local PWHT this is especially true for stress relaxation.\nExcessive or inappropriate PWHT temperatures and/or long holding times can adversely affect properties. The adverse effects can include decreased tensile strength, reduced creep strength, and notch toughness (generally caused by embrittlement due to precipitate formation). The influence of PWHT on properties primarily depends upon the composition of the weld metal and base metal and prior thermal and mechanical processing of the base metal. If PWHT is run at higher than specified temperatures and / or longer specified soak times the work piece can become more brittle than desired. The need for Post Weld Heat Treatment is usually driven by either a direct requirement within a particular fabrication or repair code or by service environment concerns. Requirements to apply PWHT are generally triggered by material type and thickness. These fabrication codes provide detailed requirements regarding local PWHT. Such âcode requiredâ PWHT is generally aimed at reducing susceptibility to brittle fracture, and as such is targeted to improve notch toughness and relax residual stress (pre-existing work piece stress, such as heat from welding, fabrication stresses, machining, cutting etc.).\nThe need for PWHT based upon service environment is not treated by the fabrication codes. Instead guidance may be found in recommended practices regarding service environment. Applying PWHT for âserviceâ can have a variety of objectives. Reduction of hardness and stress relaxation are two of the more common objectives related to service environments. It is important to note that the threshold residual stress levels in such cases are often less than those required for brittle fracture related concerns, and more detailed requirements may therefore apply. The application of a PWHT, whether directed by code or desired by a customer, is a critical evolution. It ensures the work piece is correctly reconditioned giving the customer the most desirable levels of Hardness, Strength, and Ductility, this being the ultimate goal with every job we perform. So care and attention must always be given through every phase of a cycle to be controlled at the ideal temperature over the correctly allotted time frame\nUnderstanding the areas of the work piece.\nWhen dealing with the work piece there are some important areas that you need to be aware of and key terms, and they are: Weld area (w), Heat affected zone (HAZ), Soak Band (SB), Heated Band (HB), Gradient Control Band (GCB), Nominal thickness (t), and for Piping the Diameter (D), and Radius (R).\nWeld Area and Heat Affected Zone\nThe terms Weld Area and Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) are defined as follows: in accordance with D10.10M the Weld Area is the âWidest width of butt or attachment weld.â Noted as W. Note this applies to a pipe, or plate; it can be applied to a local area or a 360 area of a pipe. Now the HAZ as seen in Figure 19 is described as, the area of the base material on the metal which has had its microstructure and properties altered by welding; Heat intensive cutting; and some time bending/ working an area. This is what we as a heat treating company are trying to fix, by restoring the HAZ to its normal condition.\nSoak Band (in accordance with AWS D10.10M)\nThe Soak Band consists of the through thickness volume of metal, which is heated to the minimum but does not exceed the maximum required temperature. As a minimum, it should consist of the weld metal, HAZ, and any portion of the base metal adjacent to the weld being heated. The Soak Band Width is established to ensure that the required volume of metal achieves the desired effect.\nHeated Band (in accordance with AWSD10.10M)\nThe next area we will be looking at is the Heated Band (HB). The HB encompasses the SB and has two major considerations. One it is large enough to insure that the minimum required temperature extends through the thickness in the SB. Two Local heating of a cylindrical shell will produce bending moments and shear stresses. These bending moments and shear stresses can cause distortion and/or induce residual stress in the weld region. The magnitude and location of these stresses are affected by the width of the HB and axial temperature distribution.\nGradient Control Band (in accordance with AWS D10.10M)\nAs the name implies, the primary function of this Band is to control the axial temperature gradient. It also serves to minimize heat losses in the heated Band (heat source). The characteristics of the insulation (both thickness and thermal properties) directly affect the power requirements of the heat source. The width of the insulated area directly affects the axial temperature gradient. The cited fabrication codes do not provide any guidance with regard to width.\nUnderstanding the different codes we use ASME B31.1-Power Piping\nThis code prescribes minimum requirements for the design, materials, fabrication, erection, test, inspection, operation, and maintenance of piping systems typically found in electric power generating stations, industrial institutional plants, geothermal heating systems, and central and district heating and cooling systems. The code also covers boiler external piping for power boilers and high temperature, high pressure water boilers in which steam or vapor is generated at a pressure of more than 15 psig; and high temperature water is generated at pressures exceeding 160 psig and/or temperatures exceeding 250Â°F.This code will generally be used in power plants from natural gas such as AEP, to hydro electric plants.\nASME B31.3-Process Piping B\nThis code prescribes requirements for materials and components, design, fabrication, assembly, erection, examination, inspection, and testing of piping systems typically found in petroleum refineries; chemical, pharmaceutical, textile, paper, semiconductor, and cryogenic plants; and related processing plants and terminals. This Code applies to piping for all fluids including: (1) raw, intermediate, and finished chemicals; (2) petroleum products; (3) gas, steam, air and water; (4) fluidized solids; (5) refrigerants; and (6) cryogenic fluids.\nAlso included is piping which interconnects pieces or stages within a packaged equipment assembly.This code will generally be used in refineries, chemical and pharmaceutical plants.\nASME SECTION I\nThis section provides requirements for all methods of construction of power, electric, and miniature boilers; high temperature water boilers used in stationary service; and power boilers used in locomotive, portable, and traction service.\nASME SECTION III NB\nThis Subsection contains requirements for the material, design, fabrication, examination, testing, and overpressure protection of items which are intended to conform to the requirements for Class 1 construction (Those components that are part of the primary core cooling system). The rules of Subsection NB cover the requirements for assuring the structural integrity of items. This code will generally be used in nuclear power plants.\nASME SECTION III NC\nThis Subsection contains requirements for the material, design, fabrication, examination, testing, and overpressure protection of items which are intended to conform to the requirements for Class 2 construction. (Those components that are part of various important-to-safety emergency core cooling systems) The rules of Subsection NC cover the requirements for assuring the structural integrity of items. This code will generally be used in nuclear power plants.\nASME SECTION VIII Division 1\nThis Division of Section VIII provides requirements applicable to the design, fabrication, inspection, testing, and certification of pressure vessels operating at either internal or external pressures exceeding 15 psig. Such pressure vessels may be fired or unfired. Specific requirements apply to several classes of material used in pressure vessel construction, and also to fabrication methods such as welding, forging and brazing. It contains mandatory and nonmandatory appendices detailing supplementary design criteria, nondestructive examination and inspection acceptance standards.This code will generally be used in refineries, chemical and pharmaceutical plants.\nASME SECTION VIII Division 2\nThese rules provide an alternative to the minimum requirements for pressure vessels under Division 1 rules. In comparison to Division 1, Division 2 requirements on materials, design, and nondestructive examination are more rigorous; however, higher design stress intensity values are permitted. Division 2 rules cover only vessels to be installed in a fixed location for a specific service where operation and maintenance control is retained during the useful life of the vessel by the user who prepares or causes to be prepared the design specifications. These rules may also apply to human occupancy pressure vessels typically in the diving industry. (Hypobaric Chambers) This code will generally be used in nuclear power plants.\nASME SECTION VIII Division 3\nThis Division of Section VIII provides requirements applicable to the design, fabrication, inspection, testing, and certification of pressure vessels operating at either internal or external pressures generally above 10,000 psi. Such vessels may be fired or unfired. This pressure may be obtained from an external source, a process reaction, by the application of heat from a direct or indirect source, or any combination thereof. Division 3 rules cover vessels intended for a specific service and installed in a fixed location or relocated from work site to work site between pressurizations. The operation and maintenance control is retained during the useful life of the vessel by the user who prepares or causes to be prepared the design specifications. Division 3 does not establish maximum pressure limits for Section VIII, Divisions 1 or 2, or minimum pressure limits for this Division.This code will generally be used in nuclear power plants.']	['<urn:uuid:f2d60fb0-9eba-4cd3-a8b3-fe14d9074faf>', '<urn:uuid:5a6f00ed-83cc-4ae1-bd8d-7401adc030b8>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	5	42	2755
19	emergency coal stove vs fireplace coal burning setup	For burning coal in a fireplace, a special grate must be fashioned with hardware cloth screening placed on a standard wood grate to prevent coal from falling through while allowing air circulation underneath. In contrast, coal stoves must be professionally installed according to manufacturer's specifications and local building codes, with sufficient space from combustible materials.	"['For the Unprepared: Home Heating in an Emergency\nAdapted by MU Extension specialists from material prepared by Cooperative Extension Service, University of New Hampshire, Durham.\nYour home heat is gone. You\'ve just discovered your heating system may be off for several days. It\'s cold outside; the inside temperature is dropping, and you have a first class emergency on your hands. What can you do?\nYour first concern should be to conserve body heat. Keep your household warm while you provide emergency heat. The simplest solution to this problem is to dress warm or perhaps get in bed.\nSafety is of paramount importance in a heating emergency. Few (if any) Americans have frozen to death in their homes in recent times. Many have perished from burns, smoke inhalation or carbon monoxide poisoning. Loss of home heat constitutes an emergency, but it needn\'t result in tragedy.\nHandling a heating emergency, once immediate requirements for body heat are met, can be broken down into five steps:\n- Finding a heat source or improvising one.\n- Obtaining fuel.\n- Selecting a room or area to be heated.\n- Setting up, testing and operating an emergency system.\n- Dealing with related problems caused by heat loss.\nSelecting an alternate heat source\nWhat kinds of heating devices do you have that can use readily-available fuel such as wood, coal, electricity, gas or oil? Perhaps you have a space heater; perhaps a stove or an electric, gas or oil heater. Do you have a camp stove? Don\'t overlook the oven in your gas or electric range. If the fuel is available, turn the range on and open the oven door.\nStoves should be connected to a chimney flue if at all possible. Many older homes have capped stovepipe thimbles in rooms once heated by stoves. You can also remove the nonfunctioning furnace pipe from its flue entrance and hook up your stove or heater in its place. Sometimes a stove pipe can be extended through a window to provide proper venting of gases.\nBe sure no heated surfaces are close to the sash or other flammable materials\n- When setting up emergency stove piping, be careful about running it too close to flammable materials. This is particularly true when using a window-mounted flue. The wood sash is flammable as are curtains or shades that might normally be on the window.\n- Flues and piping for gas-burning appliances primarily vent vapors and may be unsafe for use with higher temperature oil, coal or wood smoke.\n- A damper in your emergency flue will help facilitate satisfactory burning and regulation of the heat. Cutting down an excessive draft helps keep the heat in the room and prevents the flue from over-heating. Close the damper as far as possible without reducing combustion or forcing smoke into the room.\n- Natural gas appliances will not burn bottled gas without a mechanical conversion. Your local gas supplier has the materials needed for conversion.\n- If you use a catalytic or unvented heater, provide plenty of ventilation. Keep a nearby window open at least one inch whenever the device is in use.\nThe least desirable solution is to rely on a makeshift heater, including charcoal burning grills, camp-stoves, stackless kerosene space heaters or industrial-type oil or kerosene jet heaters. If you must use them, do so only with plenty of ventilation.\nDepending on the weather severity and the available resources, there may be other options. A camping family might have a catalytic heater (a gas or oil-fueled heater which provides heat with no flame. ) One of these units can keep a room livable in cold weather. A travel trailer or camper can be inhabited in the winter if it has a heater. More than one farm family has taken refuge in the relative warmth of a livestock barn under extreme conditions. For shorter periods, there is the family car, a last resort which will be dangerous without proper ventilation.\nBed may be the safest, warmest place for short periods. Use of adequate blankets and coverings will trap and conserve vital body heat, and two or more people in the same bed can share heat. This is an especially good way to keep children warm.\nDon\'t overlook the possibility of solar heat. An appreciable amount of heat can be gained through large windows on the southern side of the house.\nProviding fuel for heating\nMany combustibles can be considered for fuel. Some of the common ones include:\n- Furnace or cannel coal\n- Kerosene or gasoline\n- Furnace oil\n- Firewood and scrap wood\n- Wood chips\n- Motor oil\n- Campstove fuel\n- Fats, grease\n- Newspapers or magazines\n- Charcoal briquettes\n- Charcoal fluid lighter\n- Coal can be burned in a fireplace or stove if a grate is fashioned to hold it, allowing air to circulate underneath. ""Hardware cloth"" screening a placed on a standard wood grate will keep coal from falling through.\n- Paper ""logs"" can be made by rolling newspapers or magazines tightly into small log-sized bundles, which can be burned if they are stacked to allow proper air circulation.\n- There may be plenty of burnable wood around, including lumber and furniture if the situation is critical.\nStore fuels in a handy place but not in the heated area. This is particularly true for highly combustible items such as gasoline, kerosene and papers.\nWhich room should be heated?\nThe location of a fireplace, stove or chimney flue may dictate the decision. Use the following guidelines:\n- Confine emergency heat to a small area.\n- Try to select a room on the ""warm"" side of the house away from prevailing cold winds. Avoid rooms with large windows or uninsulated walls. Interior bathrooms probably have the lowest air leakage and heat loss. Your basement may be a good place in cold weather because of the heat gain from the earth.\n- Isolate the room from the rest of the house by keeping doors closed, hanging bedding or heavy drapes over entryways or erecting temporary partitions of cardboard or plywood.\n- Hang drapes, bedding, shower curtains, etc., over doors and windows, especially at night.\nCheck your efforts for safety\nAs soon as emergency heating is working and the room protected against exterior cold, stop and appraise the safety of your situation. If there is any hazard or question of safety posed by the emergency heating, make changes immediately. Check carefully for fire hazards.\nAll heaters except electric heaters should be vented to provide oxygen for complete combustion and to safely remove exhaust gases and smoke.\nDo not attempt to burn anything larger than candles in your home without providing adequate ventilation to the outside\nAsphyxiation from lack of oxygen or poisonous gases is a great danger when there is not enough ventilation. There is no simple rule for determining how much ventilation you need. For safety, provide cross ventilation by opening a window an inch on each side of a room. It is better to let in some cold air than to take a chance of not having enough air.\nAs an additional safety factor, you should have a firewatch whenever emergency heat is being used. One person should stay awake to watch for fire and to detect the possibility of inadequate ventilation. Drowsiness is one sign of carbon monoxide poisoning. If the firewatch feels sleepy, it may be a sign poor ventilation.\nIf you have not already done so, set up some firefighting items near your emergency heating device. Dry powder fire extinguishers will put out most types of burning materials. Sand, salt, baking soda or water can be used on most non-oil materials. A tarpaulin or heavy blanket can be used for smothering flames. Post your local fire department\'s telephone number near your telephone. Finally, discuss safety, firefighting techniques and a home evacuation plan with all members of your family.

20	How has Arctic sea ice changed over the years, and what are the implications of these changes for the ice's behavior?	Arctic sea ice has been thinning since 1980, with trends ranging from less than 1 cm/year to 6 cm/year in some areas of the Arctic ocean. Multiyear ice is now far less prevalent than it was 20 years ago. This change has significant implications for ice behavior: young, thinner ice melts more easily, deforms much more easily, moves faster, and is therefore exported more readily.

Key firstname.lastname@example.org 1 Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS), University of Wisconsin-Madison 2 Center for Satellite Applications and Research, NOAA/NESDIS, Madison, Wisconsin 2015 NOAA Satellite Science Week, 23-27 February, 2015, Convening at the Center Green Campus of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, 3080 Center Green Drive, Boulder, CO, USA The views, opinions, and findings contained in this poster are those of the authors and should not be construed as an official NOAA or U.S. Government position, policy, or decision. Introduction Sea ice extent and thickness affect the exchange of heat, energy, mass, and momentum between the atmosphere and the underlying ocean, and therefore play a significant role in weather and climate of the polar regions. Sea ice also has profound socio-economic value due to its critical impact on transportation, hazards, recreation, fisheries, and hunting. Conventional observations of sea ice properties are sparse, particularly sea ice thickness. Thus, satellite remote sensing data play a key role in estimating and monitoring changes in sea ice. With recent advances in remote sensing technology, it is now possible to estimate ice thickness from space using a variety of techniques, each having advantages and disadvantages. The One-dimensional Thermodynamic Ice Model (OTIM) is an energy budget approach for estimating sea and lake ice thickness with optical (visible, near-infrared, and infrared) satellite data from sensors such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). A very different approach uses lidar or radar altimeter data from the ICESat and CryoSat-2 satellites to measure ice elevation (freeboard), from which ice thickness can be estimated. Yet another method employs low-frequency microwave data from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. The energy budget approach works best for thin to moderately thick ice, altimeters have limited coverage, and the passive microwave approach is for thin ice only. All approaches are influenced by uncertainties in the depth of snow on the ice, surface melt, and other factors. In this study we compared sea ice thicknesses from seven datasets: the Extended AVHRR Polar Pathfinder (APP-x), a similar product from MODIS, ICESat from the Jet Propulsion Lab, CryoSat-2 from the Alfred Wegener Institute, SMOS from the University of Hamburg, and NASA IceBridge aircraft flights. Additionally, the satellite products are compared to ice thickness from the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS). The intercomparison is complicated by the fact that the datasets cover different time periods and spatial resolutions, with the APP-x and PIOMAS having the longest record (1982 – present). Comparisons are done for the period of overlap between all datasets, with PIOMAS as a reference data set. Preliminary results show that sea ice thickness from APPx, MODIS, PIOMAS, CryoSat-2, and NASA IceBridge agree reasonably well overall, though there are important differences that arise from limitations of the different sensors and methods. SMOS appears to underestimate the overall sea ice thickness, and ICESat likely overestimates sea ice thickness in coastal areas along Canadian archipelago. Based on S-NPP VIIRS data with the One- dimensional Thermodynamic Ice Model (OTIM) for March 21, 2013. Research datasets and their corresponding time periods. Measuring ice thickness with different approaches. (Adapted from Meier et al., 2014) Processes that affect ice thickness. (from SWIPA, 2011) Comparisons of ice thickness retrieved by OTIM with APP-x data, measured by submarine, and simulated by PIOMAS alone the submarine track segments. Overall bias between OTIM and submarine is 0.04 m, and its RMS is 0.52 m. Arctic sea ice thickness from APP-x (left), ICESat (middle), and PIOMAS (right) for the period of October 2003 to March 2008 on February-March average only. The mean bias between APP-x and PIOMAS is 0.02 m, and the mean bias between ICESat and PIOMAS is 0.35 m. Inter-comparisons of Arctic sea ice thickness from APP-x, CryoSat-2, SMOS, and PIOMAS for the CryoSat-2 period from January 2011 to March 2013 in terms of monthly mean (March). Inter-comparisons of Arctic sea ice thickness from IceBridge, APP-x, CryoSat-2, SMOS, and PIOMAS for the IceBridge period from March 2009 to April 2013 in terms of monthly mean (March). Arctic sea ice thickness trend in meter per year over 1982-2013 from APP-x dataset. Conclusion The inter-comparison is complicated by the fact that the datasets cover different time periods and spatial resolutions, with the APP-x and PIOMAS having the longest record (1982 – present). Comparisons are done for the period of overlap between all datasets, with PIOMAS as a reference data set. Results show that Biases relative to PIOMAS range from -0.3 (SMOS) to +0.5 (CryoSat-2, ICESat, APP-x, MPP-x). SMOS is intended for thin ice estimates only. All products show thinning Arctic sea ice since 1980. Trends range from less than 1 cm/year to 6 cm/year for some areas in the Arctic ocean. Multiyear ice is far less prevalent now than 20 years ago. Young, thinner ice melts more easily, deforms much more easily, moves faster, and is therefore exported more readily.']"	['<urn:uuid:e5f141c5-26ab-46eb-99d8-f85f3b57891f>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	21	65	864
21	car t cell therapy clinical trials effectiveness remission rates side effects monoclonal antibodies	CAR T-cell therapy shows impressive remission rates with 83% of leukemia patients achieving complete remission within 3 months and 50% of lymphoma patients maintaining remission for 15-24 months. Side effects include cytokine release syndrome (CRS) affecting over 90% of patients and neurologic toxicity (ICANS) affecting up to 67% of lymphoma patients. Clinical trials are ongoing, with CAR T-cell therapy being studied alongside other treatments like monoclonal antibodies (rituximab, alemtuzumab, ofatumumab) in combination with chemotherapy for both untreated and relapsed/refractory ALL.	"[""Taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice for some acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Clinical trials are under way for patients at every treatment stage and for patients in remission. Today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society continues to invest funds in ALL research.\nClick here to read more about clinical trials.\nCurrent ALL Research and Clinical Trials\nScientists are conducting research strategies and clinical trials that hold the promise of increasing remission and cure rates of ALL patients. Here are examples (and some descriptions) of specific agents under study in clinical trials for ALL. L.\n- Bortezomib (Velcade®) - This drug, approved to treat myeloma and some types of lymphoma, is now being studied in combination with other drugs such as belinostat for the treatment of relapsed or refractory ALL. It is also being studied for treating newly diagnosed pediatric patients with T-cell ALL.\n- Clofarabine (Clolar®) - Already approved to treat pediatric ALL, clofarabine is now showing promising results in studies of adults with ALL. It is also being studied in combination with other drugs such as mitoxantrone in clinical trials for the treatment of children whose ALL is relapsed or refractory.\n- Nelarabine (Arranon®) - This drug, a type of antimetabolite drug, is approved for patients who have relapsed T-cell ALL. It is now being studied in clinical trials in combination with other agents for the treatment of relapsed or refractory T-cell ALL. It is also being evaluated in combination with other drugs as part of an induction regimen for untreated T-cell ALL.\nJanus kinase (JAK) Inhibitor\n- Ruxolitinib (Jakafi®) - Already approved to treat myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera patients, it is being studied in clinical trials in the treatment of pediatric refractory and relapsed ALL. It is also being studied in combination with several chemotherapy drugs in the treatment of children with Ph-like ALL and CRLF2 and JAK mutations.\nSpecial Chemotherapy Combination\n- Augmented Hyper-CVAD - The hyper-CVAD combination (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone) is a well-established regimen for ALL. The augmented hyper-CVAD formulation was designed in 2011 and it includes intensified doses of vincristine, dexamethasone and asparaginase. Researchers are studying the efficacy of this combination for ALL treatment.\n- Monoclonal antibodies rituximab (Rituxan®), alemtuzumab (Campath®), ofatumumab (Arzerra®) - These drugs are already approved in the treatment of other blood cancers. They are currently being studied for their use in combination with chemotherapy in clinical trials for untreated and relapsed/ refractory ALL.\n- Blinatumomab (Blincyto®) - This drug is a bispecific, anti-CD19, CD3 T-cell engager, approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory Ph-negative B-cell precursor ALL. It is being studied in current trials for the treatment of refractory and relapsed ALL and also as therapy for older patients with newly diagnosed disease.\n- Inotuzumab ozogamicin - This drug is an anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody that is bound to a toxic drug called calicheamicin. It is being studied, as part of a regimen with combination chemotherapy, in the treatment of relapsed and refractory ALL.\n- Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy - This is a type of immunotherapy that consists of engineering patients’ own immune cells first to recognize and then to attack cancerous tumors. This approach has shown very promising results in patients with blood cancers. The T cells are genetically engineered to produce receptors on their surface called “chimeric antigen receptors” (CARs). These receptors recognize and bind to a specific target found on the cancerous cells. Clinical trials are studying the use of CAR T-cell therapy in the treatment of chemotherapy-resistant or refractory ALL in both adults and children.

This promising form of immunotherapy attacks cancerous cells in the body. In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first CAR T-cell treatments for patients with specific types of leukemia and lymphoma.\nWhat is CAR T-cell therapy?\nImmunotherapy is a treatment for diseases like cancer. It works in two ways:\n- By stimulating the body’s natural immune defenses to more effectively or aggressively attack all cancer cells\n- By modifying immune system properties, like proteins or cells, to attack specific cancers\nCAR T-cell therapy is the second type of immunotherapy: It activates a specific immune response.\nWhat are T-cells?\nT-cells are white blood cells that serve as the front line of the body’s immune defense system. In CAR T-cell therapy, doctors collect a blood sample from the patient and isolate the T-cells.\nScientists genetically modify the T-cells to equip them with a chimeric antigen receptor that seeks out a specific protein found on the surface of some cancer cells. The genetically modified T-cells find and destroy cancer cells that have the protein — including certain leukemia and lymphoma cells.\nHow effective is CAR T-cell therapy?\nThe FDA has approved the therapy for patients whose leukemia or lymphoma is not responding to traditional treatment. It is also approved if they have a relapse following what appeared to be a successful treatment. The level of success after a single session of CAR T-cell therapy is impressive:\n- Half of patients with lymphoma are still in remission 15 to 24 months after treatment\n- Eighty-three percent of patients with leukemia show complete remission within three months of receiving the treatment\nThough more studies are needed to determine long-term remission rates, the above rates of remission indicate 79 percent of patients are still alive 12 months after treatment. This rate is far higher than doctors expect of standard treatments.\nWhat are the side effects of CAR T-cell therapy?\nSome patients may experience side effects with this form of immunotherapy, including:\n- Cytokine release syndrome (CRS): This syndrome causes flu-like symptoms. Respiratory distress and multi-organ failure are possible. While more than 90 percent of people treated with CAR T-cell therapy experience CRS, most have mild symptoms that develop within the first week and resolve within eight days.\n- Neurologic toxicity: Previously called CAR T-cell-related encephalopathy syndrome, this condition is now called immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Up to 67 percent of patients with lymphoma and 62 percent of patients with leukemia will experience ICANS. Symptoms may include confusion, language disturbance, motor weakness, seizures and headache. Most symptoms reverse within the first three to four weeks of treatment.\nResearch paves the way for further CAR T-cell therapy breakthroughs\nWhile CAR T-cell therapy is currently only approved for two types of blood cancers, research continues to determine if it can be used to treat other types of cancers.\nScientists at UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center were instrumental in the initial studies that led to the 2017 FDA approval of CAR T-cell therapy. They are exploring future uses through several ongoing clinical trials. Patients who participate in CAR T-cell clinical trials at UCLA Health:\n- Move from evaluation to treatment within one month\n- Are typically hospitalized for at least one week following infusion\n- Must remain close to the treating medical center for the first month after treatment to monitor side effects\nBesides exploring new uses for the therapy, scientists are also investigating strategies to reduce and ease related side effects.']"	['<urn:uuid:b2a4183d-43b2-47b2-bda4-9658f14000b3>', '<urn:uuid:a648d9a5-e71b-4ef2-a76f-b6f6274cb78b>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	13	80	1219
22	ways prevent infection cholera stomach flu similar	Both cholera and viral gastroenteritis share similar prevention methods focused on hygiene: Both require thorough hand washing, especially before eating and after using the bathroom. Both infections can be prevented by properly cooking food and practicing good sanitation. However, they have different vaccine approaches - cholera vaccines provide short-term protection, while for viral gastroenteritis, only rotavirus has an effective vaccine (reducing hospitalization by up to 86% in children under two).	"['Cholera is an infection that is caused by a bacterium known as Vibrio cholerae, which attacks the small intestines. This disease is extremely contagious, especially in areas where there is poor sanitation or during disasters such as floods. It is capable of killing people who are infected within hours in severe cases if it is not treated promptly.\nAccording to research statistics, an approximate of a million to four million cases of cholera infections are reported yearly. The annual number of deaths due to cholera can range from twenty thousand to an eighth of a million.\nCholera affects adults and children, as well as men and women alike. Therefore, cholera is a disease that can affect anyone. However, there are people who are more prone to getting it than others. There are places where cholera is endemic. In other areas, it breaks out as an epidemic.\n""Endemic"" means that a particular disease is native to the place. There have been several cholera outbreaks in the past that have caused deaths in thousands or even in millions. Cholera epidemics usually arise in areas with poor sanitation and scarce resources like water and toilets.\nThe areas that have been affected by wars, natural disasters, poverty, or any other factors that force people to overcrowd are the most prone to massive outbreaks of cholera. The reason is that such places will most likely have poor sanitation and means of waste disposal more so feces. The bacteria that cause cholera will thrive under such conditions.\nCholera is mainly transmitted through contaminated food and water. Flies are the main carriers of the bacteria to the food. When they land on the food, they contaminate it, and whoever eats the food, also gets infected. Eating an undercooked food will also make people get infected if the bacteria were present in the meal.\nContaminated water also helps in spreading the disease. Basically, human feces are the carriers of Vibrio cholerae. When clean water gets into contact with the bacteria, it becomes contaminated. Anyone who drinks such water or uses it to cook food gets infected.\nWho is more prone to the infection?\nCholera is a highly communicable disease. Aside from living in areas where there are epidemics or factors that favor its spread, the following people are more likely to be infected:\nKids like playing a lot. They can carry out their games near sewers, pits, around latrines, and at times, as they play with water, their games can be held in ponds. All these are the places that are prone to have the bacteria that cause cholera.\nTherefore, children get exposed to factors that aid in the spread of the disease more than adults. When they come into contact with the contaminated water, the likelihood that they will get cholera is very high. The reason is that some will suck their fingers afterward or eat food without washing their hands. Through unhygienic practices, they will introduce the bacteria into their bodies.\n2. Careless Doctors and Nurses\nCareless doctors and nurses who handle cholera patients are also likely to get the disease. The reason is that some of the healthcare professionals do not observe maximum caution when dealing with their patients, e.g., not wearing gloves. Eating food without washing their hands after handling the patients also heightens their risk of getting infected.\n3. Family Members and Friends of Victims\nWhen people get sick, the closest around them are the ones who take care of them. Such people may include friends or family, which makes them prone to getting infected, too.\nParts of the World that Are Most Affected by Cholera\nThe parts of the world that are most affected by cholera are:\n- South-East Asia\n- Some parts of Africa\n- Central America\n- Central Mexico\nThese areas are heavily populated and the levels of sanitation are extremely low. These areas are able to provide a suitable place for the bacteria to exist and multiply.\nHow does cholera cause death?\nWhen the bacteria get inside your body, they cause diarrhea that can be very violent in some cases. Severe diarrhea results to dehydration of the body. In severe cases, the blood pressure drops and infected people go into a state of shock. If they do not receive medical attention quickly, death occurs within hours.\nWhat are the symptoms of cholera?\nPeople with cholera show symptoms differently. Some may experience symptoms within a few hours after infection, while in others, symptoms may begin to show after several days. The symptoms of cholera may include:\n- very watery diarrhea (main symptom)\n- muscle cramps can also occur at times\n- diarrhea that usually leads to an excessive loss of water from the body (dehydration)\nDehydration can cause the following conditions:\n- development of wrinkles on the hands and feet\n- the skin becoming less elastic\n- sunken eyes\nPeople who experience severe dehydration will require an immediate correction of the fluid imbalance in their body. Therefore, they have to be hydrated in order to prevent any further damage or complications.\nTips on How to Minimize the Risks of Getting Cholera\nOne of the ways used to control cholera is the use of a vaccine. However, vaccination is not a guarantee, as the vaccine does not usually last for long. That is why it becomes necessary to avoid getting infected with cholera. There are a number of things that you can do to lower your chances of being infected by the disease. Listed below are tips on how to prevent a cholera infection:\n- Parents should always be aware of their kids’ activities. They should keep track of where they spend their time and make sure that it is not in areas where they are likely to pick up the bacteria. The levels of hygiene should also be very high. They should make sure that the kids wash their hands before they eat and after they use the toilet.\n- Implementing high standards of sanitation and hygiene also make you less likely to get infected.\n- Doctors, nurses, or any other medical practitioners who handle patients with cholera should also exercise caution by using protective gears such as gloves. They should also observe high levels of sanitation.\n- Any friends or relatives around a person with cholera should also be careful in how they carry out themselves, especially on hygiene issues.\nThe Bottom Line\nCholera is a water-borne disease. Since this bacteria will more likely be transmitted through water, it is very important to be careful when using water in areas that are prone to the disease. Drinking water should be well-boiled and food should also be cooked properly. These precautions will help ensure that the bacteria are killed by the heat.\nThe main issue is for hygiene to be exercised at the highest of levels. If it is possible, avoid areas that prone to the disease. If you cannot avoid these places, then following the above-given tips should allow you a better chance at avoiding the disease.\nAnyone can get cholera and children are the ones that are most likely to get infected. Thus, keep an eye on your kids and should they show any symptoms, visit a medical facility as quickly as possible as they can get worse quickly and even die.\n- Who Gets Cholera?\n- Cholera Risk Factors\n- Prevention of Cholera', 'What is Gastroenteritis?\nNausea, cramps, stomach aches, and diarrhea — these are the uncomfortable signs of gastroenteritis, which is often called the stomach flu. Despite the moniker, the viruses that cause gastroenteritis are distinct from those that cause the flu. This means getting your flu shot won’t prevent you from catching this infection.\nWhat is viral gastroenteritis?\nViral gastroenteritis damages the gut, causes inflammation, and makes it harder for the body to absorb water leading to vomiting and or diarrhea and dehydration. Due to their weakened immune system, the stomach flu can lead to complications in children and the elderly. In developing countries, viral gastroenteritis leads to more than 200,000 deaths of children per year.\nFortunately, the stomach flu doesn’t last long and in most cases, is treatable at home. The infection typically lasts one to three days and treatment involves hydration and over-the-counter medicines that target the other symptoms.\nWhat causes gastroenteritis?\nGastroenteritis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Viral gastroenteritis, normally called the stomach flu, is mostly caused by viruses like norovirus or rotavirus. Viruses are microscopic machines that hijack our body’s cells to make more copies of themselves. The damage that they cause along the way, as well as the body’s immune response lead to the symptoms of this condition.\nCan you prevent gastroenteritis?\nOne of the main ways that the stomach flu passes between individuals is through the oral-fecal route, or by touch rather than airborne spread[2,3]. This means that viral particles shed in the stool make their way back into the gastrointestinal tract. Good hand hygiene, including washing hands before eating and after using a washroom, and making sure to close the lid on the toilet before flushing will help reduce the spread of the virus[2,3].\nIn addition, these viruses can stick to surfaces, food, and water. Making sure to wash your hands before preparing any food, cleaning fruits and vegetables, and ensuring meats are completely cooked before consumption can help stop the spread of stomach flu[2,3].\nOne of the most effective ways to prevent one type of viral gastroenteritis in children is rotavirus vaccination. Since 2006, several safe and effective vaccines against rotavirus infection have been developed for use in children under two years old. They reduce the risk of hospitalization with diarrhea up to 86 percent. Note that this vaccine does not protect against other viruses, such as norovirus. Speak with a pediatrician to learn about what options are available for your child.\nSymptoms of gastroenteritis\nBoth the rota and noro viruses causes similar symptoms which last several days, including:\n- Vomiting. When it encounters something infectious or damaging, the gut responds by attempting to expel it through vomiting.\n- Diarrhea and dehydration. The rotavirus damages gut cells that would normally absorb water and other electrolytes, leading to diarrhea.\n- Abdominal cramps. Dehydration, damage to the gut and electrolyte imbalances could cause cramping.\n- Low appetite. This could be caused by the body’s general “sickness response”, which fires up the immune system but dampers appetite.\n- Fever. This is the body raising the temperature to help the immune system fight off the virus.\nRotavirus or norovirus?\nRotavirus is the most common cause of gastroenteritis in children. The first symptom of this form of the stomach flu is vomiting. Children remain symptomatic for about three days but will continue shedding virus in their stool for up to 10 days, meaning that adults could catch it without careful hand hygiene. However, many people develop immunity to rotavirus infection early in life, so it is usually asymptomatic in adults.\nNorovirus is the most common cause in adults, but also occurs in children. For norovirus infection, vomiting usually follows abdominal cramps and diarrhea. The norovirus also usually resolves itself within 72 hours or three days.\nThe goal of treating viral gastroenteritis is to rehydrate the body and medicate away any other bothersome symptoms. Treatment includes:\n- Drinking fluids to prevent dehydration. Drinking water, teas, and warm soups can compensate for the fluid loss caused by diarrhea. Sports drinks can help replenish the electrolytes that are lost as well.\n- Medications to prevent vomiting. Over the counter medications like Pepto Bismol or generic formulations with the same active ingredient bismuth subsalicylate can help reduce vomiting.\n- Probiotics and prebiotics to treat diarrhea. Probiotics are beneficial microbes that keep the commensal microbes living in the gut healthy. Prebiotics are foods that feed these microbes. Probiotics and prebiotics could reduce the frequency of diarrhea, especially if taken prior to getting sick.\n- Rest. Sleeping and resting helps the body focus on fighting off the infection faster.\nWhat to eat while you’re sick and recovering\nSimple and easy to digest carbohydrate based foods, such as bananas, rice, apples, and toast are common dietary recommendations for dealing with bouts of diarrhea. However, studies so far haven’t shown that this diet is actually better for recovery. If foods can’t be tolerated, ensure that fluids consumed include some carbohydrates and electrolytes.\nFor recovery, it is recommended that you eat as normally as possible, starting with small amounts of food. Avoid highly processed, very spicy, or fried foods while recovering. Some people experience milk lactose intolerance immediately after gastroenteritis and have to limit dairy products for a short period of time.\nWhen should you see a doctor?\n- Difficulty hydrating or retaining fluids orally. In this case, saline or other intravenous fluids are needed to rehydrate. During the hospital admission, staff will carefully monitor your hydration and electrolyte levels. This can also occur as a result of prolonged bouts of diarrhea.\n- Fever higher than 39 degrees. High fevers can be dangerous, especially for children, and can cause further dehydration.\n- Uncontrollable vomiting. If you or your child are unable to get vomiting under control, it may be necessary to receive stronger prescription medication. In some cases, it also requires hospital admission.\n- Other conditions or comorbidities. Metabolic conditions such as diabetes, as well as pregnancy, and many other medical conditions could put you at extra risk.\nViral gastroenteritis — more commonly known as the stomach flu — causes nausea, cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. Improving hand hygiene, food handling practices, and vaccination can reduce the risk of catching the stomach flu. Most cases are treatable at home through hydration and over-the-counter medications.\n- Stuempfig, N.D., Seroy, J. Viral gastroenteritis. (2022). StatPearls.

23	Could you compare the precision requirements in construction between the Sydney Opera House's glass walls and the Gateway Arch's steel triangles?	The Gateway Arch required extremely precise construction tolerances - the stainless steel triangles had to be positioned within 1/64th of an inch at the base to ensure the two sides would meet at the top. The triangles measure 54 feet wide at the base and narrow to 17 feet at the top. For the Sydney Opera House's glass walls, precise specifications were also crucial - they used a specially designed laminate consisting of two glass layers (one clear float glass layer and one tinted layer) with a strengthening plastic layer between them. The tinted glass was a special color called demi-topaze, specifically developed for the Opera House to offset the greenish tint of the thicker glass layer and provide a warmer color.	"['This image is the product of a trip to the library, about an hour\'s\nworth of reading about the architecture of the building, some careful\nmeasurements with a pencil and ruler, and about two hours of POV\nIf you never knew how the shape of these shells was designed, this second image may shed some light! The surface of each shell is actually a part of a sphere, as I learnt from my studies. Each of the eight shell halves which make up the four main shells can be cut from the same sphere. The concert hall shells have a sphere radius of 75 metres. This image shows the spheres for the west (right) side shells, and you can see how the shapes fit the surface of the translucent bubbles.\n6 July. I went down to the Opera House and took a roll of film as reference photos. My photo developer must have thought I was crazy, because I took lots of shots of staircases and railings and only one or two showing the typical touristy ""interesting"" bits.\n8 July. I made an appointment to see Jørn Utzon\'s original architectural plans at the State Library of New South Wales. This was very cool. I was escorted into a big room with lots of people working on restoring and preserving old documents and sat down at a desk with a selection of the plans (there are thousands of drawings). They gave me a pencil to use as I measured the plans and took notes, because the rules say no pens can be used anywhere in that room. Two hours later I had 4 sheets full of detailed sketches and notes to use in my modelling.\nThis is a working image of the podium. I have most of the forecourt steps modelled here. Trouble is there are so many steps that the aliasing is rather bad. Still, I\'ll leave them in for now because the final view may show some in close up.\nOh, I\'ve also redone my measurements of the spherical geometry of the shells and done some more accurate calculations to get the angles and stuff right. The actual image of the shells hasn\'t visibly changed much, but it\'s much closer to the real thing now.\n20 July. I had copies made of some of Jørn Utzon\'s architectural\nplans from 1962. The State Library was very helpful, and I now have\nsome huge and detailed plans to take measurements from.\nI\'ve done all of the podium steps and added the shells in their correct relative positions. The forecourt and broadwalk areas still need to be added, but for this image I added some water so I can get an idea how the overall final composition will look. There is still plenty of detailing to be done... particularly the glass walls enclosing the hall interiors and the wooden interior walls. Oh, and all the land and trees and other buildings in the background!\n30 July. I went to a concert at the Opera House tonight. Anthony\nWalker conducting the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and Sydney Philharmonia\nChoirs in a selection of choral pops. They performed some of my\nfavourite choral music, including selections from Messiah, Beethoven\'s\n9th Symphony and Carmina Burana. It was a fun concert, and I also did\nsome raytracing research by measuring up exact sizes of steps and\nlandings and various other things with a tape measure!\n7 August. I\'ve added some of the minor shell components, and the copper ribbing underneath the major shells. This is a test render, with the podium removed. The red dot is a light source. I was moving them around trying to get the copper ribs lit up and couldn\'t see where the light sources were so I made it a red ball. The red bar is the vertical coordinate axis, also added to help me navigate around the structure. All the copper underneath the minor shells will be hidden by wood and glass later.\n9 August. Started work on the glass walls. My research has given me the exact thickness of the glass used. The panes are a laminate of two layers of glass - a thick layer of clear float glass, and a tinted layer of glass - sandwiched around a layer of strengthening plastic. The tinted glass is a colour called demi-topaze, developed specially for the Opera House, which offsets the slight greenish tint of the thicker glass layer and gives the final result a warmer colour. I\'ve cheated and modelled the laminate as a single layer of slightly topaz-tinted glass.\n31 August. I kind of got stuck there, being far too busy with work\nthe past 3 weeks. My entry was submited in an unfinished state.', 'Today, a chain and an arch. The University of Houston presents this program about the machines that make our civilization run, and the people whose ingenuity created them.\nEero Saarinen had a problem. The Finnish architect was holding a drooping chain between his hands. He was illustrating a point to his structural engineer, Hannskarl Bandel. A hanging chain forms a catenary curve, a well-known geometric form. But geometry wasn’t the issue. It didn’t look right. Look right for what? Well, try flipping that chain upside down in your mind’s eye and multiply by, say, 600. Saarinen and Bandel were staring at the future Gateway Arch, the tallest monument in the country, the largest arch ever built. They were drawing the blueprints. Saarinen wanted his arch to have a soaring feeling, and the hanging chain just wasn’t quite it.\nThe story goes that Bandel then took the chain and said, give me a few days. When he came back, he’d replaced some of the links in the middle of the chain with smaller ones. That changed the weight of the curve…just a bit. Saarinen was elated. The Arch had found its shape.\nBut, why an arch at all? The 38-year-old architect had won a prestigious competition for a new national monument, sited for the banks of the Mississippi in downtown St. Louis. He had edged out 171 other competitors, including his own father. The vote was unanimous, and for good reason. Saarinen explained that an “absolutely simple shape” was the basis of memorials that have kept their significance over time, such as Egypt’s pyramids. He decided against the classic rainbow-shaped Roman arch or the peaked Gothic arch. A catenary curve arch wasn’t unknown in architecture, but it wasn’t very common, either. And now Bandel’s modified chain was an arch no one had ever seen before.\nA catenary curve is the shape of a hanging chain supporting only its own weight.\nConstruction began in 1963. The sides of the arch are stainless steel equilateral triangles, 54 feet wide at the base. They shrink to a mere 17 feet at the top — Bandel’s skinny chain links. The building tolerances were insanely tight. Off by more than a 64th of an inch at the bottom, and the two sides wouldn’t meet up at the top. St. Louisians watched as the legs of their arch grew closer together. When the last center triangle was finally hoisted into place, massive hydraulic presses pushed the legs apart to accept the joining piece. Two precarious halves became an invincible whole. The Gateway Arch is so strong it sways only 16 inches in tornado-force winds.\nSadly, Saarinen never saw it. He died during surgery for a brain tumor, shortly before construction. The arch was completed in 1965. It’s meant to commemorate the story of our nation’s westward expansion, and the audacity of the men and women who achieved it. But, try standing right next to this giant gleaming icon, and look straight up. Gravity vanishes as the steel road vaults 630 feet into the sky, then returns to earth. It’s a dizzying effect, and covered wagon trains are probably about the last thing you’re thinking of. That’s okay. Audacity, period, is the story of Eero Saarinen’s magnificent arch.\nI’m Roger Kaza, at the University of Houston, where we’re interested in the way inventive minds work.\nThe Gateway Arch is often described as a catenary arch, and the description is partially true. Neither the exterior dimension (extrados) nor the interior (intrados) is a pure catenary curve. But an “imaginary” center dimension, going precisely through the middle of the arch, is. Bandel’s and Saarinen’s innovation of a tapered, diminishing structure, aside from its aesthetic value, accomplished several things. It transferred the weight of the arch downward, whereas a pure catenary pushes the stress outward. It allowed the Arch to gain an additional 40 feet from its original proposed height of 590 feet. The arch’s structural integrity comes from its stressed stainless steel skin, similar to airplane wings, which bear much of the load. This is attached to an inner wall of carbon steel. In addition, the base of the arch is reinforced with concrete. It extends all the way to the 300 feet level, three feet thick at the base and one foot thick higher up, and this, along with reinforcing steel rod, accounts for much of the Arch’s strength.\nIt is said that in ancient Roman times, the builder/designer of an arch was required to stand under it as the wooden scaffolding was removed. Quality control!\nWikipedia entries for Saarinen and Bandel.\nTheir original sketch\nof the Arch.\nThe geometry of a catenary curve was explored by Galileo. Robert Hooke examined it in the context of architecture.\nFor more on the mathematics of the Arch, see this site.\nAn excellent commentary on the Arch’s architecture.\nAs this piece was being written, the Gateway Arch is in the first stages of a major renovation of its surrounding environs, intended to be complete by 2015, the 50th anniversary of the completion of the Arch. The contract was won by the New York landscape design firm MVVA. For detailed information, with charts, drawings and videos of the proposed changes, as well as the opportunity to comment on the plans, visit their site.\nThe official name for the Gateway Arch monument (rarely used by locals) is the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial. Underneath the Arch is a museum recounting the history of American westward expansion, starting with the Louisiana Purchase.

24	As an industrial historian, how does Rivers of Steel preserve Pittsburgh's heritage?	Rivers of Steel preserves Pittsburgh's heritage through multiple initiatives: they offer tours (including the Uniquely Pittsburgh Sightseeing Tour on the Explorer riverboat), support economic revitalization, promote heritage tourism, preserve cultural resources, and maintain historical sites like the Carrie Furnaces National Historic Landmark, where they also facilitate arts programs and exhibitions.	['The Explorer riverboat travels on the Monongahela River with Pittsburgh’s First Side in the background.\nRivers of Steel Launches New Tour on the Explorer Riverboat\nThe Uniquely Pittsburgh Sightseeing Tour Begins June 18\nHomestead, PA (June 1, 2021)—On Friday, June 18, Rivers of Steel will launch a new tour on the Explorer riverboat—the Uniquely Pittsburgh Sightseeing Tour. The 90-minute excursion on Pittsburgh’s three rivers seeks to answer the question “What makes Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh?”\nTraveling on the Ohio, Monongahela, and Allegheny Rivers, this tour shares the big stories of our region’s past—along with many lesser-known tales—as it explores a sense of place. It encourages participants to sit back, enjoy the skyline, and see the sights as they discover how Pittsburgh’s unique history shaped the city we have today.\n“For more than 25 years, Rivers of Steel has worked to tell the stories of southwestern Pennsylvania,” explains August R. Carlino, president and chief executive officer of Rivers of Steel. “With the Uniquely Pittsburgh tour, our region’s legacy will be amplified, enabling locals and tourists alike to connect the past with the present and gain a greater appreciation of Pittsburgh’s role in American history.”\n“This new tour was written with locals in mind,” said Brianna Horan, Rivers of Steel’s manager of tourism and visitor experience. “As we emerge from the pandemic, many folks are exploring places and attractions closer to home, so we crafted this experience to ensure local audiences would be just as entertained and educated as those visiting from farther away.”\nTours will be offered at 10:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., Friday through Sunday from June 18 through the end of August. Prices range from $12 to $23 with adult, senior, student, and child rates. Advance ticket purchases are required.\nProceeds from tours and charters on the Explorer riverboat help to underwrite Rivers of Steel’s STEM-based education programs onboard the vessel for students throughout southwestern Pennsylvania.\nVisitors can listen to the narrated tour from the main and upper decks via a 30-speaker sound system. The interior, temperature-controlled cabins and open deck spaces can currently accommodate 50 people for a tour (a limit of 50% of the standard capacity). There are three restrooms, including one ADA-accessible restroom on the main deck.\nThe 94-foot Explorer is the world’s first vessel to have LEED standards applied to its entire engineering and construction process. Features of the riverboat are a nod to “green” in terms of durability, sustainability, and the environment.\nAbout Rivers of Steel\nFounded on the principles of heritage development, community partnership, and a reverence for the region’s natural and shared resources, Rivers of Steel strengthens the economic and cultural fabric of western Pennsylvania by fostering dynamic initiatives and transformative experiences.\nRivers of Steel showcases the artistry and innovation of our region’s industrial and cultural heritage through its historical and 21st-century attractions―offering unique experiences through tours, workshops, exhibitions, festivals, and more. Behind the scenes, Rivers of Steel supports economic revitalization—working at the grassroots level to deepen community partnerships, promote heritage tourism, and preserve local recreational and cultural resources for future generations.\nContact Carly McCoy at 412.464.4020, ext. 243 or by emailing email@example.com.\nRivers of Steel | The Bost Building, 623 East Eighth Avenue, Homestead PA 15120', 'Almost 100 feet tall and constructed of 2.5-inch-thick plate steel lined with refractory brick, the iron cupolas at the Carrie Furnaces National Historic Landmark in Swissvale and Rankin, Pennsylvania, are extremely rare examples of pre-World War II iron-making technology. Since the collapse of the Pittsburgh region’s steel industry and the dismantling of most of the mills along the waterways of southwestern Pennsylvania, the Carrie Furnaces are the only non-operative blast furnaces in the area that remain standing. A visit to the Carrie Furnaces is like stepping into a cathedral of iron and steel. The architecture is both overwhelming and inspiring. This is a sculptor’s paradise, and it also happens to be one of the sites for the 26th International Sculpture Conference, “Sculpture in Context: Tradition and Innovation.”\nPlace matters, and tradition and innovation surround this National Historic Landmark. Built in the late 1880s, the Carrie Furnaces produced iron for the Homestead Works steel operation (after 1898), which was owned by Andrew Carnegie, and then US Steel (Henry Clay Frick). Iron flowed from its seven cupola furnaces for close to 100 years. Furnaces 6 and 7 are the only ones that still remain on the site. During the 1920s, ’30s, and ’40s, Carrie 6 and 7 consumed approximately four tons of raw iron ore, coke, and limestone for every ton of iron produced. The cooling system for the blast furnace required more than 5,000,000 gallons of water a day, all supplied by the Monongahela River. The furnaces reached their peak production in the 1950s and ’60s, when they were producing 1,000–1,250 tons of iron a day. It was here, just outside Pittsburgh, that steel became synonymous with American progress and industrial revolution. This is the birthplace of American big steel. From these furnaces flowed the molten alloy that was formed into many monumental icons of the American built environment, including the Empire State Building, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the Brooklyn Bridge.\nUS Steel ceased operations at the Carrie Furnaces in 1984. When the site was sold to the Park Corporation in 1988, the company started to dismantle and salvage the steel structures and machinery. During that time, many local artists would jump the fence and explore the derelict site, including the locally famous Industrial Arts Cooperative (IAC), a rogue group of guerrilla artists led by sculptor Tim Kaulen. The group created monumental site-specific installations from materials found there and spent several seasons of dedicated effort creating the massive Carrie Deer that is still on the site today. Many sculptors and graffiti artists created passionate works among the rusting giants of the Carrie Furnaces.\nThe Steel Industry Heritage Task Force was also founded in 1988, the same year that the Park Corporation bought the Carrie Furnaces. In 1991, the organization morphed into the Rivers of Steel Heritage Corporation (RSHC). A visionary nonprofit, the RSHC was formed through a collaborative effort between the National Parks Service and the Pennsylvania County and State Departments of Conservation and Recreation with the intention to secure the Carrie Furnaces site. The RSHC now owns and stewards many sites of cultural importance in the Pittsburgh region, repurposing and preserving them for future generations. Its mission includes historic preservation, cultural conservation, education, recreation, and resource development. Through the tireless efforts of the RSHC and its main historian and hyper-passionate site manager, Ron Baraff, the Carrie Furnaces now offers a dynamic platform for the arts. Baraff and the RSHC have approached the site in an extremely open manner. Realizing that the site had more potential than just a monument to the region’s past and that it could be accessed through multiple forms of interpretation, they welcomed art as a catalyst.\nAnyone who has a foundry practice or understands the steel and iron heritage of the area will marvel at the majestic array of buildings and cupolas that make up this unique campus. In the mid-2000s, local sculptor Ed Parrish Jr. started running iron pours at the Carrie Furnaces as part of his Hot Metal Happenings (funded by the Sprout Fund), whose purpose was to share with the regional community the fact that iron casting in Pittsburgh is still happening (at a smaller scale)—this time, for making contemporary art.\nIn 2013, two art professors from Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP)—Chris McGinnis, a curator, and fellow colleague/ sculptor Sean Derry—formed Alloy PGH. Artists accepted to this biennial residency, education, and exhibition program receive the opportunity to respond to the Carrie Furnaces site. Funded by local arts organizations such as the Sprout Fund, IUP’s Kipp Gallery, and Radiant Hall Studios, Alloy PGH has brought in artists, historians, ecologists, and curators to help the artists-in-residence learn more about what it means to work contextually. Luminaries such as Ann Hamilton and Mary Jane Jacob helped younger artists, including Ricardo Robinson, Oreen Cohen, Carl Bajandas, Ryan Keen, and Edith Abeyta, to create fantastic installations on site during the 2015 program. McGinnis and Derry had the vision and the drive to bring artists to this dynamic location to demonstrate how the visual and performing arts can transform neglected sites into gathering places. The 2013 and 2015 iterations of the program have been extremely successful, establishing the model as a regional gem of an art exhibition that challenges visitors to experience the Carrie Furnaces in a whole new way.\nAt the same time that iron casting events and Alloy PGH were beginning to take shape at Carrie, landscape ethicist and photographer Rick Darke had been documenting the site’s ecological fabric. Darke’s passion for place and the site led him, in consultation with the RSHC and Baraff, to invite the Penn State Master Gardener Program of Allegheny County to develop a comprehensive plant survey in and around Carrie.\nIn 2014, the Master Gardeners—led by Susan Marquesen, Joanne van Linden, Addy Smith-Reiman, and Anna Johnson—put together a team of artists, ecologists, historians, and students to develop a multi-disciplinary approach to interpreting the native and invasive plant species that are surviving, and even thriving, in the disturbed soils of the Carrie Furnaces site. As part of their research, they addressed best practices in environmental stewardship and responded to the site itself with the Iron Garden Walk, which is open to the public and features a series of 10 interpretive iron plaques. First, the Master Gardeners consolidated their research to develop the content, which includes botanical illustrations from the Hunt Institute of Botanical Documentation at Carnegie Mellon and descriptions of the various plants growing around the foundry, and Smith-Reiman created the layout of the plaque designs. The designs were translated and milled in high-density urethane (HDU) on the CNC in the Carnegie Mellon Sculpture Department by art student Lauren Valley. The patterns were molded by myself and Ed Parrish Jr. and cast on site with the Master Gardeners, CMU students, a large contingent of local artists, and Casey Westbrook of Carbon Arts. After the pour, the plaques were installed for future generations of visitors to discover through the seasons.\nThe Iron Garden Walk is a perfect example of collaboration between multiple organizations, using art and cast iron to bring people with related ideas together. The Master Gardeners, with the help of historians and artists, were able to realize their concept of how the site might be seen. By supporting projects like the Iron Garden Walk and Alloy PGH, the Rivers of Steel Heritage Corporation has been forward-thinking in its approach to how this site can benefit from its context, heritage, and public engagement.\nThe RSHC continues to diversify, bringing more artists to engage with the Carrie Furnaces. It recently unveiled a newly formed program, Rivers of Steel Arts (RoSA), headed by artist Chris McGinnis. Through RoSA’s multifaceted programing, the Carrie Furnaces is quickly becoming one of the region’s most exciting venues for the arts, education, and entertainment. RoSA has seen the benefits of multiple forms of community outreach and has teamed up with Parrish Jr. and Westbrook to develop Carbon Arts at Carrie, a metal arts program that will offer educational opportunities for mold-making, casting, and welding in the coming years. The groups are in the process of putting together infrastructure for a permanent foundry on the site, outfitted with a gantry, material storage, classrooms, and eventually multiple iron cupolas of various sizes. RoSA is dedicated to artistic programming that reimagines the future of familiar places, builds pride in community, and attracts renewed public interest in Pittsburgh’s Monongahela River Valley. It continues to evolve and hone its program offerings to attract new visitors from the local, regional, and global community to the site, while knowing the past and embracing the future. RoSA has already generated a substantial and eclectic program, including artist residencies, eco-arts, photo arts, urban arts (graffiti), film, dance, theater, festivals, and heritage arts consisting of a regional folklife center that represents eight counties in southwestern Pennsylvania.\nDuring the 26th annual International Sculpture Conference, conference-goers will have a chance to visit the Carrie Furnaces for panel discussions, cast iron workshops, tours of the Iron Garden Walk, and an exhibition of contemporary cast iron sculpture curated by Westbrook and Parrish Jr. For more on the arts at Carrie, visit http://rosarts.org.\nJoshua Reiman is an artist living in Portland, Maine, where he is also an assistant professor in the MFA in Studio Art + Sculpture programs at the Maine College of Art.\nWatch these videos on the Carrie Furnaces']	['<urn:uuid:c5b92ec8-4a2c-47ba-9f3c-a231a3b59eed>', '<urn:uuid:eef00725-c4d0-4ba0-8f28-fcef60e8f74c>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	12	50	2091
25	How does corporate transformation to B Corp status affect scientific research?	The transformation to B Corp status enables scientific research through a sustainable enterprise model. For instance, SPYGEN uses the benefits generated from their commercial activities to finance research and conservation projects for key species and ecosystems.

Through the development of its technologies and its involvement in numerous conservation programs, SPYGEN has naturally set itself the mission of improving the monitoring and conservation of biodiversity at a global scale.', 'Did you know that 1 in 3 businesses that submit to become a Certified B Corporation will certify for it?\nB Lab, the global network for the B Corp movement, admits that it can be challenging to receive this certification. But it is worth it for businesses ready to walk the talk and pivot to become the best business for the world.\nWhat’s a B Corporation?\nA Certified B Corporation is a business that focuses on a triple bottom line: people, profit, and planet. It is a hybrid between a standard corporation and a nonprofit organization. That means the business earns a profit.\nIn addition, a Certified B Corp is also held accountable to higher social and environmental standards. Being held accountable for these higher standards allows the business to do two things. The business is able to prioritize its triple bottom line. It also elevates the entity to B Corp status.\nHowever, think carefully before pivoting to this Certification. It is critical that the members, or owners, of your business formation prepare to make the shift. If your business is incorporated as a corporation, for example, the board of directors and investors must discuss plans to obtain B Corp Certification. This pivot presents significant changes for the business. All individuals must understand why these changes are useful for the company. Members or owners may vote to make their decision.\nCertified B Corporation Requirements\nBecoming a Certified B Corporation means completing a certification process. Let’s review what happens during this process. We’ll also look at long-term benefits businesses receive with a B Corp Certification.\n1. Complete the B Impact Assessment\nYou may think you are ready to “B the Change,” but first you must take and pass the B Impact Assessment (BIA).\nThe B Impact Assessment is a free tool. It allows a company to measure its impact on its workers, community, environment, and customers.\nBIA starts with an assessment. This includes questions about what it takes to build a better business. Remember that a better business is one that is better for its workers, community, and the environment.\nYou can get a quick snapshot of how your business is doing and its impact by taking the 30-minute test. However, if you wish to further pursue Certification you must complete the full impact report. This takes two to three hours to complete. It consists of 200 questions. These are determined by your company size, sector, and market. A verified total score of 80 across all impact areas is required to pass the BIA.\nOnce you have taken the full impact report, review your results holistically afterwards. See how your answers compare to other businesses. Then, create a customized improvement plan. Work on ways you can improve your score to be part of the B Corp movement. You may download improvement tools and case studies available on the BIA website for additional resources.\n2. Fill Out the Disclosure Questionnaire\nIn order to complete the BIA, the business must answer questions about any material negative impacts. Essentially, the Disclosure Questionnaire allows for a public compliant process. This includes background checks and disclosure of any sensitive business practices.\n3. Meet the Legal Requirement\nThe legal requirement for a Certified B Corporation gives legal protection to directors and officers to consider the interests of all stakeholders when making business decisions. It also creates rights for shareholders to hold directors and officers accountable to consider these interests.\nThere is a grace period from B Lab for companies completing the B Corp legal requirement. Changes may be necessary depending on entity formation and location. For example, some businesses may need to reincorporate. They may also decide to adopt a benefit corporation status. A B Corp Agreement must be signed by the business. This commits to meeting the legal requirement.\n4. Take the Verification Process\nA multi-step verification process must be taken by the business. This allows them to find out if they met the 80-point score necessary for Certification. In addition, the B Corp Agreement should outline transparency requirements. Businesses will agree to meet these requirements as a Certified B Corp.\nOnce you complete the BIA and Disclosure Questionnaire, submit both for review with B Lab.\n5. Schedule an Assessment Review\nAfter submitting the BIA and Disclosure Questionnaire, a B Lab Standards Analyst will reach out to you. This is to confirm this submission and details about your business.\nAn assessment may then be scheduled to review the BIA together. Typically, these calls take between 60 to 90 minutes. This ensures thorough review and accuracy for the company and how it plans to commit to the public benefit. A successful review will allow your business to move forward. Pay the annual certification fees and sign the B Corp Declaration of Interdependence before becoming a Certified B Corp.\nHowever, please note that B Lab is experiencing high volumes of Certification interest. The review process for Certified B Corporations may now take anywhere from six to 10 months to complete. Check in with B Lab regularly for any updates and changes.\nBenefits of Being a Certified B Corporation\nThere is an almost endless list of benefits that come with B Corp Certification. A few years ago, we interviewed the founders of Certified B Corporations. These businesses either started their companies as Certified B Corps or pivoted to that Certification.\nWhat benefits do they receive as a Certified B Corporation?

26	fall turkey food sources natural artificial feeding	In fall, turkeys focus heavily on feeding and building fat for winter. They naturally feed on mast crops like acorns from oak trees, beech nuts, and fruits from cherry trees and grape vines. While they can be attracted using artificial bird feeders, this practice is discouraged as it causes turkeys to lose their natural fear of people and can lead to aggressive behavior. Instead, the recommended approach is providing natural food sources by planting native oaks, berry-producing plants, and maintaining areas with leaf litter where turkeys can forage for insects and other small animals.	['By: Jake Stanisch\nWhen hunters talk about fall and hunting season, many of their minds race forward to cool November mornings spent sitting in their tree stand. Many states have even legalized crossbows for all to use, making it easier for more hunters to get into archery hunting in the fall. Most hunters associate turkey hunting with warm spring mornings, when love sick longbeards’ run to hen yelps, gobbling the whole way. Fall turkey hunting has seemed to have taken a back burner for most hunters in recent years, but fall turkey hunting can provide a very exciting hunt. Fall is a time of the year that most will associate with two things, food and family; turkeys are no different.\nSpring and fall are the only two times of the year that seem to matter for the turkey hunter. In the spring time we are hunting the wild turkeys during their breeding season, and gobbles can be heard for up to a mile on a calm morning. We are reversing nature by trying to call the gobbler to the hen, or the hunter doing the calling. Hunting turkeys during the spring is one of my favorite things to do. There isn’t anything quite like having a turkey gobbling or drumming so close to you that you can feel it vibrate on your chest. This will make the most seasoned hunter come unglued with excitement!\nMost states wild turkey populations are doing well enough that hunting fall turkeys is permitted. Most often, hunting turkeys in the fall of the year is quite different than hunting them a mere six months earlier. In the fall and winter seasons, turkeys are mostly focused on feeding and putting body fat on for the upcoming winter season. During the fall or winter season we are hunting “normal turkeys”. What I mean by normal turkeys, is how they act the majority of the year. Spring gobbler hunting is focused around hunting turkeys that are in the midst of their breeding season. During the fall and winter, turkeys aren’t focused on breeding; they are focused on food. A hunter that regularly finds success with fall turkeys spend many days afield scouting before their seasons come in. Some of the turkey hunting tactics can be the same, many are different.\nMore often than not, turkeys are found in areas close to where you saw and heard them in the spring time. Do not take it for granted that you will find them in the exact same spots, because that might not always prove to be true. Scouting in the fall should be focused around food sources. If you are hunting mature hardwoods in hilly or mountainous terrain, concentrate on finding out where the mast crop is. By mast crop I mean oak, cherry, and beech trees that are producing fruit (nuts). Turkeys love these nuts and will spend considerable amount of time feeding in these areas. Turkeys also love to eat grapes that drop from grape vines. It is nearly a sure bet that you will find turkeys in a patch of producing grape vines. Once you find where the food is, carefully comb through these areas to find where the turkeys are feeding. During years where there are multiple areas with mast crops, finding turkeys will be difficult. Turkeys will be moving from one food source to the next.\nAfter you have located the food sources, you will need to make sure there are turkeys in these areas. A fall hunter can utilize several spring scouting tactics to find turkeys during the fall months. One very effective overlooked tactic, is getting out in the woods prior to daylight and listening for roost talk and turkeys flying down. Fall turkeys will call while they are on the roost, prior to flying down; just like they did in the spring time. The calling will most often be dependent on what mood the turkeys are in, and what kind of turkeys that are roosted near you. There are several kinds of turkey flocks that you may run into during the fall seasons. The most common is a flock of hens and their poults from this past spring. The poults usually will range from 8-12#, depending on when they were born and how much food is available to them. This kind of flock is usually the most vocal, especially when they are split up from one another. The younger birds will try to yelp to search for their mother hen. Their yelp (kee-kee run) will come out similar to a high-pitched whistle, due to their vocal cords not being fully developed yet. Flocks of mature gobblers are often times silent on the roost during the fall. However, they do make quite a racket while flying out. If you listen closely, you can hear their wing beats from around a hundred yards away. Occasionally you will hear some gobbling or gobbler yelps from a flock of mature gobblers. I have even experienced a flock of mature gobblers strutting, drumming and gobbling in the fall. The gobbling and strutting are to iron out the pecking order of that group of gobblers, not to display for hens. The last common type of flock would be a flock of barren hens that did not have any poults. These birds will commonly be yelping and clucking on the roost.\nThe next piece of the puzzle that you will want to look for is, where they go once they fly down. Determining where birds will head in a remote wooded area in mountainous terrain can be more difficult than in farm country. I like to look for different changes in terrain in more mountainous regions. This is no different than when hunting whitetails. Animals will take the path of least resistance. Terrain features can be anything as simple as a funnel, a bench, or steep side hill. Turkeys prefer to be roost higher on the hill (during nice weather), and they can see danger coming from below them. One thing that a hunter in farm country has going for them is, the ability to see for a long way across an open field. Inclement weather makes turkeys much more predictable, due to their nature. Rain, wind and hard snowfalls will drive birds to more open areas in lower elevations. This can be found in every terrain feature that I have hunted so far. These inclement weather conditions make it very difficult for turkeys to detect danger coming, and will make turkeys go to more open areas. Wind and rain make it more difficult for turkeys to hear, therefore they are going to favor their eye sight in these kinds of conditions. Turkeys will most often head for a food source after they fly down and begin feeding. This is no different than most of us going to our kitchen to eat breakfast after waking up. Find the food and you will find the turkeys.\nDo your homework and learn as much about the turkeys in the areas you hunt and you will have a successful fall season.', '6 Tips for Feeding Wild Turkeys with Your Garden\nThe wild turkey is one of the most recognizable birds in all of North America and a symbol of the holiday season. As these fascinating and adaptable birds are becoming increasingly common backyard visitors and popular birdwatching subjects, you can turn your own yard or garden into a natural buffet to support them.\nInstead of focusing on the turkey on your dinner plate, consider what food sources you can offer wild turkeys and increase your chances of seeing and enjoying them right outside your window. Here’s how to fill the wild turkey’s proverbial “plate” with food year-round.\nFeeding Wild Turkeys the Natural Way\n- Plant Native Oaks: Acorns are a key food source for wild turkeys. By planting native oaks, like red oak, chestnut oak and black oak, you’ll supply them with plenty of acorns to eat. Turkeys eat acorns in fall and winter and in many oak forests you can even notice a V-shaped scratching in the leaf litter (a sure sign of wild turkeys). Many other wildlife species rely on acorns as a food source too, so you’ll be feeding more than just turkeys when you plant native oaks.\n- Plant Other Nut and Berry-Producing Plants: In addition to oak acorns, other staples of the wild turkey diet include beech nuts, pecans, hickory nuts, crabapples, and hackberries. By planting native nut and berry-producing plants you’ll provide turkeys with the natural foods they’ve consumed for thousands of years. Other planting suggestions include black cherry trees, blueberries, wild grapes and dogwood. They’ll consume cacti fruits in arid areas. They will even consume poison ivy berries (along with dozens of other bird species).\n- Offer Seeds and Browse: Turkeys browse on plant buds and shoots in the early spring and feed off fern fronds, club mosses, and weeds such as burdock, especially when there is a lot of snow cover and other foods are hard to find. Grasses, sedges and many wildflowers provide wild turkeys with seeds to eat. We don’t encourage attracting turkeys with birdseed from feeders, mostly because artificially feeding turkeys causes them to lose their natural fear of people*.\n- Grit and Gravel: Turkeys will swallow grit to help them digest their food. Offer grit by placing a shallow bowl filled with sand, fine gravel, sterlized ground eggshells or ground oyster shells. Or just keep a patch of sandy soil free of plants.\n- Stop Using Pesticides: Aside from the direct harm you can cause wildlife by using pesticides, by not using these chemicals you’ll make sure that turkeys have plenty of much-needed protein in the form of insects. About ten percent of an adult wild turkey’s diet consists of small animals, including insects such as stink bugs, grasshoppers, and ground beetles, as well as snails, slugs, worms, spiders and other invertebrates. Turkey chicks, called poults, begin foraging shortly after hatching for invertebrates, which make up a large portion of their diet as they grow. Turkeys will actually help keep invertebrate pests in check for you, and there are many organic gardening techniques you can also use to control pest outbreaks.\n- Leave the Leaves: By leaving some dead plant matter in your garden, you’re providing habitat for the small animals that are a key part of a turkey’s diet. Turkeys forage for invertebrates in the leaf litter and also enjoy eating salamanders, frogs, snakes, and lizards that also live in the fallen leaves or decaying logs.\nBonus Tip: Provide a water source in addition to providing natural food sources. By providing a backyard pond or even a birdbath placed directly on the ground you’ll supply clean drinking water for the turkeys.\n*Male wild turkeys are territorial and can occasionally become aggressive, especially during the spring breeding season. This often happens when wild turkeys are being artificially fed with feeders and have lost their natural fear of people, so avoid doing that. If turkeys are cleaning up spilled seed from songbird feeders, take those feeders down. If you have plenty of native plants in your yard, all the birds will have plenty of natural foods to eat.\nIf you encounter a turkey that’s got something to prove, assert your dominance by standing your ground and chasing it away by walking towards it with a broom or rake or spraying it with a garden hose, to remind it where it fits in the pecking order. Male turkeys are large and intimidating and do have sharp spurs on their legs, but generally pose little actual threat of harm to humans. If you find that the wild turkeys in your yard are too much trouble, we recommend putting automatic sprinklers in your yard to scare them off whenever they show up. They also don’t like larger dogs and avoid yards where they are present.\nSign up for our free Garden for Wildlife newsletter.

27	My basement is cold. When will my pipes start freezing?	Pipes become vulnerable to freezing when outside temperatures reach 20 degrees Fahrenheit and remain at that temperature for 6 consecutive hours. This often happens overnight, when temperatures are lower and the freezing conditions go unnoticed until people turn on their taps.	['Each year, roughly a quarter of a million households in the US experience frozen or burst pipes. In fact, such damages account for 11-20% of homeowner’s insurance claims annually.\nAnd it’s no trivial amount either: burst pipe repair costs around $100-$200 per foot, with most families shelling an average of $400 to $1,500. This amount doesn’t include the clean up and repair costs of water damages, which can add a further $1,000 to $2,000 on top of the bill.\nTo avoid this headache, it’s crucial to make sure your water pipes are prepared for the cold season. Here’s how to winterize your pipes for reliable and hassle-free plumbing.\nKnow the Danger Temp\nWater freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit. However, pipes that are indoors and insulated from exterior temperatures are more protected.\nThe typical danger threshold is when outside temperatures reach at least 20 degrees F. At this stage, even indoor pipes are vulnerable to freezing.\nKnow How Long It Takes\nIn general, outside temperatures below 20 degrees F that last for 6 consecutive hours present a danger to indoor plumbing. This is why most burst pipe cases happen overnight: not only are temperatures lower at night, the freezing temperatures are uninterrupted and go unnoticed by most people, until they turn on the tap.\nKeep It Flowing\nIn cases of prolonged freezing temperatures, keep one or two faucets open and running. Water movement stops the water supply from remaining pooled and freezing in the pipes. It doesn’t have to be a powerful flow: even a modest trickle can help. This is especially true during freezing nights.\nCheck your Air Seals\nAir leaks are a major source of heat loss in winter. Not only do they cause discomfort and higher utility bills, they can damage your pipes by lowering the indoor temperature despite the thermostat setting.\nFor your water line, check for air leaks around the pipeline, dryer vents, and outside connections such as an outdoor tap. Thanks to metal conductivity, a tiny air leak in one area can travel a great deal of distance and travel down, affecting a considerable length of pipeline.\nUse foam insulation to cover exposed pipes. These come in different types:\nFlexible elastomeric foams – these have high water vapor resistance with the flexibility of rubber\nRigid foam – Made from PUR or PIR, these have reduced thickness but lowered acoustic performance\nPolyethylene – A cheaper option made of flexible foamed plastic\nOpen Cabinet Doors\nFor pipes that are under sinks or next to outdoor walls, keep the cabinet doors open. This will allow the heat from inside the home to circulate inside the cabinet, lowering the risk of freezing.\nThis also helps you spot danger signs like water pooling and icing before you turn on the tap.\nUse Heat Tape\nHeat tapes are insulation covers specifically designed for use with plumbing. Despite the name, it’s less of an adhesive tape and more of an electric blanket that wraps around water lines. They are self-regulating and come with a built-in thermostat to adjust their heat output based on the ambient temperature.\nOlder heat tapes needed to be hardwired into the home’s electrical system. However, newer versions are plug-and-play with standard outlets; just make sure to connect them to an outlet with a ground fault circuit interrupter (GCFI) for safety.\nKnow When to Bring the Heat\nIf you don’t have heat tape, or if some suspect some parts are more vulnerable than others, warm it up. These include:\n- Pipes that run next to an outside wall\n- Pipes near a window\n- Pipes connecting to an exterior faucet\nFor more information about winterizing your home and not just your waterline, read our guide to preparing your home for winter.']	['<urn:uuid:d7986c82-b67e-4f38-abd2-524500911b04>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	10	41	622
28	What impacts do large images have on website speed and Core Web Vitals?	Large images significantly impact website speed in two ways: they increase loading times and affect Core Web Vitals scores. They can hurt crawler rankings and dismiss visitors by causing slow loading times. Additionally, they specifically impact the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) score, which measures how long it takes to render the largest element on a page, and can affect the Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) score if images don't have specified height and width attributes.	['Optimizing Images in WordPress\nThese days, image-heavy design is the norm. The web is a visual experience and including high-quality photos in your content – often multiple per page – is key to attracting and converting traffic. But with every image you include, the time that it takes to load your website increases, and a website that is slow to load can kill your conversion rate too. So what to do?\nThis post (and its related meetup!) is all about optimizing images for the web – a.k.a., how to make it possible to include lots and lots of beautiful images on your website without hurting your page speed or user experience.\nWhat do we mean by Image Optimization?\nThe short, TL;DR answer: Image optimization is a process through which we improve our images so that they load faster on the web\nImage optimization is both an art and science: an art because there is no one definitive answer for how best to compress an individual image, andImage Optimization, Google Developers Guide\na sciencebecause there are many well developedtechniques and algorithms that can significantly reduce the size of an image .\nImage optimization includes several different steps and, as referenced above, not all steps will be right or the same for every image. When we’re thinking about reducing image size at Road Warrior Creative, my marketing agency, we generally approach it in two different ways:\n- optimizations that happen to the image offline – before it even gets uploaded to the website, and\n- optimizations the can be done on the website.\nLet’s dive a little deeper into those two things.\nHow To Optimize An Image Before You Upload It\nThere are several ways to optimize and image before you even upload it to your website, and the first is by determining if you really should be using an image in the first place!\nEliminate Improper Use of Images\nIncluding photos or graphics throughout your content is great, but if your image has text on it, think twice before you upload!\nWe frequently see people make posters or graphics for events and then post them directly into blog posts or static pages on their websites, often with little or no accompanying text. Not only is it bad for accessibility to have text and vital information on an image (because it’s invisible to screen readers), but it’s also bad for mobile users who will have to zoom in to read the text and, you guessed it, these types of images are also typically very large files.\nThis image, for example, is great for marketing on social media or in an email, but not good to embed directly on a web page:\nIf you have images like this, they should be built as web pages, where some parts of the\nUse the Right Image Format\nThere are two types of image formats:\n- vector graphics that use lines and shapes to represent an image and that can be scaled up or down without losing quality, and\n- raster images that use pixels, and will lose quality if zoomed in or size up from the original image size.\nMost images that typical users will upload are raster images. These are file types like JPEGs, PNGs, and GIFs. We’ll come back to these in a moment.\nAn example of a vector file\nTypically, SVG images are used more by WordPress developers when building themes or plugins, but you can try adding them too! WordPress’ media library does not support SVG uploads by default,\nNote that came up during our Meetup: Because they are made of code, it is important to be aware that SVG files can contain malicious code that can harm\nJPEG and PNG Images\nJPEG or JPG images are what you’ll most commonly see on the web. This is the type of file that your camera saves when you take a picture, and have the ability to be optimized for the web, typically with a smaller file size\nPNG files were made for web viewing – they don’t support print-specific color modes, and they have support for transparency, which\nSave Your Image for the Web\nOne of the biggest mistakes we see people making is not saving their images for the web prior to upload. Don’t take a full-size image from your camera or Shutterstock, and upload it directly to your WordPress site!\nAn image is considered “saved for the web” if you have done the following:\nSize the Image for Use\nAt most, your image should only be 2x as large as the size at which you intend to display it. The 2x consideration takes into account retina devices that may make your image look pixelated when displayed at twice the pixel density, but in my experience, this typically only matters for graphics like logos and icons, not photographs.\nWhat does this mean in real life? If you use images that are 900px wide on your blog, then you should typically upload either a 900px wide image or, at most, and 1800px image. Don’t upload photographs that are 5000+ pixels wide! This is way too big and unnecessary.\nReduce Pixel Density to 72dpi\nPixel density refers to the number of pixels that are in an inch. In print we use 300dpi. Some cameras take images that have thousands of pixels per inch. On the web, all you need is 72 pixels per inch. Your images will still look great and your image size will be cut in half.\nRemove Image Meta Data\nImage files often have lots of unnecessary meta data saved in the file – information about the camera that took the image, location, etc. Removing this unnecessary data will significantly reduce your image size.\nHow to Save Images for the Web\nYou can save images for the web using a photo editing software like Photoshop or Lightroom, or Gimp a free, open source photo editor. If you have a Mac, you can save images for the web in Preview, and on a PC, you can even do many of these optimizations in MS Paint.\nOptimizing Images in WordPress\nAfter you have prepared your images for upload and you get them on your website, that’s not the only thing that needs to be done to ensure that they’re loading quickly.\nFirst, a reminder to always use the right image size! I cannot emphasize that enough. This is especially important for WordPress theme and plugin developers to keep in mind when developing their products.\nAdd An Image Compression Plugin\nAn image compression plugin will further optimize your images by stripping unnecessary data and compressing the image as much as possible to reduce the size of the file. There are websites, like TinyPNG.com, where you can upload and compress infinite images for free,\nHere is some information on popular image compression plugins for WordPress that you might like to check out. There are more than are included on this list below, however these are some of the top on our list.\nWP Smush (Free)\nWP Smush is a very popular free image compression plugin. You can find WP Smush on WordPress.org here. This is a good introductory plugin, however it does have some downsides:\n- You can only bulk smush 50 images at a time.\n- It will not optimize images over 1MB in size\n- It doesn’t perform well in comparisons (more on this below)\nWP Smush Pro\nThis is the professional version of WP Smush. It does a great job of optimizing images down to a much smaller size without losing quality, and with the pro\nThis $49/month grants you access to all the plugins made by WPMU Dev, this author of WP Smush, however, if WP Smush Pro is all you need, that may seem like a hefty price tag, depending upon your budget and the number of images that you need to compress each month.\nTinyPNG WordPress Plugin\nThe same website referenced above has a TinyPNG WordPress plugin that allows you to optimize images as you upload them to your media library. TinyPNG will optimize all image types (not just PNGs), so don’t be fooled by its name. It does a great job compressing images.\nTinyPNG is a freemium plugin, which means you can use it for free up to a point. You can compress up to 500 images each month for free. After that, you’ll typically pay $0.009/image compression.\nShortPixel is another freemium WordPress plugin for compressing image. On the free plan, you can compress up to 100 images per month. After that, there are several pricing tiers based on volume; 100-5000 image compressions per month is $4.99, for example.\nIn our tests, ShortPixel did the best job of compressing images to\nreSmush.it is a free, open-source image compression plugin with no paid version.\nWhich Compression Plugin Should I Choose?\nWith all the options out there, you may be wondering which plugin to choose. I don’t think there is any plugin that is right for every website, because every website and website owner has different needs. Here are some things to consider when choosing a compression plugin:\n- How much to you need to reduce image file size by?\n- How much do you care about image quality in the final image? Final image quality probably matters a lot more to a photographer than a lawyer, for example.\n- How many images will you upload to your site every month?\n- How many images sizes does your site generate every time you upload an image? Core WordPress likely generates at least 3 sizes; your theme and some plugins will also generate some – all of these count against any image quotas.\n- How large will your starting files be? (Hopefully not more than 5MB… 😉\n- What is your budget?\nDo A Compression Test\nIf you are trying to decide between a couple of different ones, try running a compression test! Install both plugins either on the same site, one at a time, or on different sites. Configure them similarly, then upload the same image to see how the images look and by how much each plugin is able to reduce the file size.\nWe recently ran a similar test. We offer WordPress website hosting to our clients and wanted to start including image compression software in every website we host. For this test, we tried all the plugins above, except for TinyPNG. Here is the original images that we tested\nObviously, this image is massive and is completely wrong for the web. It hasn’t been pre-optimized at all, and\nHere are the results, in order from least reduction in file size to most (largest file to smallest file). All image sizes listed, reference the file size for the “full-size” image\nIn the above compression test, ShortPixel was the best as reducing file size, but had noticeable image quality loss – the edges of some of the peppers and mango pieces were blurrier than we would prefer. WP Smush Free barely reduced the file size, and WP Smush Pro and reSmush.it had the most noticeable difference in color vibrancy – we guess that was as a result of those plugins changing the color mode from CMYK to RGB.\nAfter looking at final results, we ran one more test, first saving the image for web in a normal RGB color mode, and WP Smush Pro was able to reduce the file size to 210KB with no\nThis one did lose some “vibrancy” but that happened at the time when we converted it RGB color mode in Photoshop, not during compression.\nWhat We Chose\nIf you’re wondering what we chose, we ended up deciding to go with WP Smush Pro. This does not mean it’s the right plugin for you, but it was for us, largely because we were adding it to 50+ sites and did not want to have to worry about potential costs when paying on a per-image basis or having to limit image size or number.\nIf you have fewer sites and have total control over what’s being uploaded, one of the other options might work perfectly for you.\nWhat is the ideal size?\nDuring our meetup, someone asked what the ideal size is. Unfortunately, there is no clear answer to that. As mentioned above, optimization is a little bit science and a little\nThe ideal size for an image is as small as you can possibly get it without making it noticeably bad to look at.\nIf you really want an ideal size, then you need to do a little math. Your total page size for initial load should be under 3MB. Do a speed test of your page or post, with no images added in see how large the page is. Subtract that from 3MB and you’ll know how much “space” you have left for images.\nOther Ways to Speed Up Your Site\nOptimizing images is just one way to speed up your website. If you’re interested in approving your site speed, please check out the case study linked above (in the SVG section). You may also want to do some research into:\n- how your hosting impacts website speed,\n- adding something like “lazy load” to incrementally add things to the page as users scroll, and/or\n- improving your website’s code.\nHave comments or questions about image optimization?

Besides, having enormous picture records is one of the primary drivers of slow stacking times. Luckily, there are multiple ways you can improve pictures for web execution.\nIn this post, we’ll examine the effect of pictures on your site’s presentation. We’ll then, at that point, share perhaps a couple ways of advancing your photos successfully.\nHow Much Do Images Affect Web Performance?\nThe Core Web Vitals are metrics that Google uses to evaluate the performance of your website. When you run a page speed test, Google will generate a report based on several factors, including:\n- First Contentful Paint (FCP): When the browser renders the first Document Object Model (DOM) element on your page.\n- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): The time it takes your website to render the largest element on your page (typically an image or video).\n- First Input Delay (FID): The amount of time from when a user first interacts with your page (such as clicking on a button) to when the browser responds to that action.\n- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): How much of your website’s content shifts around the page as it’s loading. For example, elements such as images and buttons may move around the screen, preventing users from interacting with your site.\nYou can check to see how your site fares in these areas by using an online tool such as PageSpeed Insights or GTMetrix. All you have to do is enter your URL, and you’ll then receive a report with your scores:\nThe report also gives you suggestions on how to improve your performance. This advice may include images that need to be optimized for faster loading times.\nFor instance, the report might identify the largest contentful element on your page as the hero image. If that’s the case, you can resize and compress the image file to improve your LCP score.\nImages can also impact your CLS score. A high CLS score suggests that your site contains images without specified height and width attributes.\nThe browser is therefore spending time trying to resize images appropriately. This process leads to shifting elements as your page loads, disrupting the user experience. You can easily fix this by setting dimensions for every photo you upload on your site.\n2 Ways You Can Optimize Your Images\nAs we have seen, images can affect your Core Web Vitals scores. Let’s look at two effective ways to optimize images for web performance!\n1. Compress Your Images\nCompression is the process of reducing the file size of your image. There are two main types of compression methods:\n- Lossy: This method removes large amounts of data from your image, significantly reducing the file size.\n- Lossless: This compression technique reduces your file size without removing any data from the image.\nLarge image files can put a lot of strain on your loading times, leading to a slow website. They can also take up a lot of space on your server.\nTherefore, we recommend that you compress any images that you upload to your site:\nLossy compression tends to be more effective than lossless. This is because it gives you more flexibility with size reduction. The only downside is that lossy compression could impact the quality of your images.\n2. Resize Your Images and Use the Right Dimensions\nAnother effective way to optimize images for web performance is to resize them. Typically, the larger the dimensions, the larger the file size.\nTherefore, you may want to consider cropping your images before uploading them to your website. You can do this with an image editing software of your choosing.\nFurthermore, when you upload an image to your site, WordPress will automatically generate different sizes for it. These typically include large, medium, and small versions, as well as thumbnails:\nThis way, WordPress enables you to serve the most appropriate image size to your readers. It also helps the browser show the correct image dimensions based on your visitors’ devices. As such, these settings make your website more responsive.\nWhen adding an image to your posts, you may want to set the size to large rather than full size. Likewise, if you’re designing a blog feed, you can select thumbnails instead of larger image sizes for your featured pictures.\nIf you use a larger dimension than necessary, you’ll be putting needless pressure on your site’s speed. You’ll also be taking up more space on your server.\nHow to Optimize Images the Right Way\nFortunately, there are several tools you can use to optimize images for web performance. This section will look at some best practices to help you get started.\n1. Use an Image Compression Tool or Plugin\nAs mentioned earlier, compression helps reduce the file size of your images. You can use many tools to compress your photos, including image editing software such as Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Photos.\nYou can also use an online tool like TinyPNG:\nThis tool uses lossy compression to reduce the size of your WEBP, JPEG, and PNG files. All you have to do is upload your images, and TinyPNG will compress them for you.\nOnce you’ve installed and activated the plugin on your site, you can go to Settings > Imagify to set your compression preferences:\nWe recommend setting the compression level to Aggressive. This setting will reduce the file size by a significant amount without any noticeable differences in image quality.\nWhen you’re ready, click on Save Changes. Imagify will now automatically compress any images that you upload to your site.\n2. Resize Images in the WordPress Editor\nWe’ve also talked about the importance of resizing your images for faster loading times. You can resize your photos on your computer before uploading them to your WordPress site.\nHowever, you can also resize your pictures within WordPress. Simply select the image in your post or page, and adjust the width and height from the settings panel on your right:\nAlternatively, you can locate the image in your Media Library and select Edit Image. This action will take you to a window where you can crop your image and set new dimensions:\nAs you can see, the WordPress editor also lets you choose one of the automatically generated image sizes. If you’re using graphics in blog posts, we recommend opting for large rather than full size. This setting will render smaller image sizes without compromising on quality.\n3. Change Your Maximum Upload Limit\nWordPress comes with a maximum upload file size. This amount can vary depending on the resources allotted by your hosting provider.\nTo check your current maximum file size, navigate to Media > Add New in your WordPress dashboard. On this page, you’ll see your upload limit:\nTypically, you won’t need to change this value unless you upload larger files. However, you may want to decrease the file size limit to prevent other users from uploading larger images than necessary. This setting can be handy if you run a multi-author blog.\nTo do this, you can simply contact your hosting provider and ask them to change the maximum upload file size. Alternatively, you can change the WordPress upload limit by editing your php.ini file.\n4. Delay Resizing Scripts\nTherefore, if you’re using a script to optimize your images, its timing can affect the load time of your page. You can solve this issue by using a plugin such as Flying Scripts:\nThis tool enables you to delay running specific scripts until there is no user activity. This setting can help reduce the time it takes for your page to load.']	['<urn:uuid:a4266a4a-6085-4b5f-a24d-2e841afce55f>', '<urn:uuid:5d8642dc-bfee-4e05-a3e5-d8ff85821abd>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	13	74	3522
29	duties responsibilities females south sudan countryside	Women in rural areas of South Sudan work extremely long hours performing numerous unpaid duties. They tend to their families, take care of children, the elderly, and people with disabilities, manage livestock, and work in farms to provide food. These physically and emotionally demanding tasks are time-consuming, leaving women with little time for self-care or participation in community politics. In places like Akobo and Tonj South, it is considered taboo for women to address groups of men.	['Development in South Sudan is curtailed by the ongoing widespread conflict coupled with very high levels of food insecurity and derailed economic progress. Conflict has led to significant displacements of populations from both urban and rural areas, with the most impact being felt in rural communities, which are conducive for agriculture and livestock production - but this production has been hindered. During this year’s International Day for Rural Women, ACTED recounts the role rural women of South Sudan play to ensure survival and progress in their communities.\nNot only do women work extra hours in a day, tending after their families without any pay, but women in rural areas of South Sudan do so amidst the most extreme circumstances, and with very little expectations. From engaging in daily households duties to taking care of children, the elderly, sick, people with disabilities, and tending to livestock, women burst their backs in farms in order to put food on the table. These duties are physically challenging and emotionally draining, not to mention time consuming. This leaves them with barely enough time to take care of themselves, or participate actively in community politics. The latter, is a role reserved only for men in say, Akobo and Tonj South, where it is considered a taboo for a woman to address a group of men.\nWhen an ACTED team visited Asunta, a 25-year old mother of three boys and three girls, they have to interrupt her sorghum harvesting session. She is deeply engrossed in the farm, humming in a beautiful voice, depicting happiness and peace of mind. It is quite intriguing how she thrushes the sorghum heads at a remarkable speed and moves swiftly to the next plant, almost missing the presence of the team. She is one of the beneficiaries of ACTED’s BRACED resilience project funded by DfID in Tonj South. She turns around and exchanges pleasantries with the team, quickly apologizing for not noticing them earlier. With a warm handshake, she leads them to her hut, which is 400 metres from her husband’s farm. One can tell from the clean and well organized homestead that Asunta is not only responsible, but also wise. She explains that her secret to handling all homestead chores and the farm is learning to manage her time wisely. This involves waking up before everyone else and going to sleep last.\nWhen I got married, I knew I had to take good care of my family as is the role of women in the community. We are nurturers and I am happy to have a peaceful home\nThough she lives with her husband and their children, she says she has learned not to rely on his support to provide for the family because life has become increasingly unpredictable. From ACTED’s project, she has gained a lot from lessons on modern farming, and as a result she has diversified her crops to include groundnuts, maize and sorghum. Asunta believes in spreading her risks in anticipation for hard times. When she is not working in her husband’s farm she gathers bundles of grass for sale to diversify her household income. When the team implores on how she uses money earned, she chuckles and waves her right arm across her face in wishful thinking, “My husband makes decisions on how we spend money that we both get. I give every coin I earn to him to make such decisions.” However, she is quick to add that her husband supports her and makes smart decisions. She is happy that her husband respects her and increases their livestock in times of plenty.\nDespite her hardwork and dedication to her family, Asunta is one of the many women who barely own any assets at their households due to cultural norms that discourage ownership of property by women. Asunta discloses, “My culture has since prohibited us from owning property and assets in the family, but we are allowed to acquire and manage the assets like small ruminants. For example, I bought 3 goats and 4 chicken with the profit I made from the sale of vegetables last season. However, I had to get my husband’s approval to do so”. Asunta’s narrative is quite common in rural areas, where women are real champions and agents of transformative change. Asunta says, “Spouses should be sensitized to recognize our hard work and allow us participate in household and community planning activities.” However, restrictions on asset and property ownership remain impediments to independent thought, which could reflect poorly on a community dominated and driven by male voices only. ACTED works with such rural communities to change their mindsets through comprehensive and well integrated projects that challenge existing norms. Through the inclusion of adequate representation of women in agro-pastoral field schools where inclusive learning is experienced, the community is slowly accepting women as individuals with clear strategies and plans that can lead to the development of the whole community.']	['<urn:uuid:f237028a-b849-4d85-8e07-43bffc27950d>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	6	77	818
30	belgian ipa taste characteristics	Belgian IPAs have distinctive taste characteristics from Belgian yeast, contributing spice and ester flavors like clove, banana, apple, and pear. The maltiness is light with sweet-grain qualities and possible low notes of caramel or toast. Hop flavors are medium to high, featuring tropical, melon, pine, citrus, and stone fruit notes from New World hops, or floral, spicy, herbal notes from Noble hops. The beer has high bitterness that may be enhanced by the spiciness from Belgian yeast, and finishes dry to moderately dry with possible lingering sweetness.	['Nick Carr on October 14, 2016 2 Comments History of Belgian IPA Brewing in Belgium stretches back some 2000 years, and the first recorded use of hops in brewing comes from Picardy, France in 822 A.D, about 1200 years ago. Picardy, France is less than 125 miles from Belgium, making it possible, even likely, hops were being used in Belgian brewing around this same time period. By the 1300s, hops were being cultivated in some of the Low Countries, including Belgium. Belgian beer is often typecast as only lightly-hopped and not very bitter. This stereotype is true to some extent. Belgian beers are often light bodied and crisp, so they tend to need less balancing then fuller beers. But the stereotype is only partially accurate. Some older traditional Belgian beers carried a hoppy bite. As this article (a good one to read if you’re gonna brew anything Belgian) points out, things like brewing specialty beers in the face of the crisp lager craze, the popularity of sodas, and the novelty of exported sweeter Belgian brews at the beginning of the craft beer movement ensured the stereotype. An example of these hoppier Belgian brews can be found in the form of Brouwerij Van Eecke’s Poperings Hommel ale. This beer is made with four different kinds of hops and was first brewed in 1981, well before the IPA craze had taken hold. Its IBU rating is somewhere between thirty and forty, so not quite within Belgian IPA style guidelines, but some websites have taken to placing it within the style. There have always been a few hoppier Belgian beers like Poperings Hommel, but a new appreciation and popularity of the hop, largely fueled by America’s craft beer movement, has inspired Belgian brewers’ to embrace their hop-bittered past and build upon it. Urthel Hop-it was probably the first IPA-inspired hoppy Belgian. It was created after head brewer Hildegard van Ostaden returned from a 2005 trip to the U.S. De Rank XX Bitter and Houblon Chouffe followed in close secession in 2006. On the American end, Stone’s Cali-Belgique seems to be one of the first commercial American examples. It was released in 2008. Belgian IPA is a fledgling style, much like the rest of the specialty IPA category; and like most of the specialty IPA’s it stands at a crossroads between style lines. Some may ask whether it should even be its own beer style. Most of the true Belgian IPAs, those made from a Belgian recipe and then “hopped-up,” could easily find a place in other style categories, be it Golden, Tripel, or Saison. On the other hand, American-Belgian IPA’s, those using an American recipe and Belgian yeast, don’t fit under the current American IPA style guidelines. So, is a new category necessary? New additions to the BJCP style guidelines are mostly based on a beer’s popularity. Before they became popular, all of these beer styles would have fallen under the blanket of “specialty” or “mixed-style” guidelines. Then they become popular. IPA’s are very popular, thus much experimentation took place with hopping other styles, thus we get new hoppier versions of a given style. They gain some of their own popularity and get put under the IPA umbrella because, well, that’s how the public knows a beer is hoppy. How long the Belgian IPA lasts as its own distinct style will undoubtedly be decided by its own popularity and the continuing status of its mother style. But, for now we can celebrate the ingenuity and experimentation of the brewers’ art, its popularity, and a reimagining of the hoppier side of Belgian brewing history. Style Profile & Characteristics The guidelines for the Belgian IPA style are set by the Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) Style Committee. The below details are a summary of what a Belgian IPA should represent. BJCP Guidelines Color Range: 5 – 15 SRM Original Gravity: 1.058 – 1.080 OG Final Gravity: 1.008 – 1.016 FG IBU Range: 50 – 100 ABV Range: 6.2 – 9.5% Serving & Storage Temperature: 48 – 50°F Shelf Life: 3 to 6 months Suggested Glass: Tulip or IPA Glass The BJCP classifies the Belgian IPA beer style under category number 21, “IPA” and it can be found in the guidelines as sub-category (21B), “Specialty IPA.” Other Specialty IPA Styles: In total, there are six “Specialty IPA” styles included in the BJCP guidelines. Aside from Belgian IPA, these include the following: Black IPA Brown IPA Red IPA Rye IPA White IPA The only other sub-category within the IPA category is American IPA (21A). Appearance: A Belgian IPA will be light golden to amber in color. Clarity depends on dry-hopping and can range from good to very hazy. A long-lasting, moderate to somewhat large head of off-white foam should form. Aroma: Smooth, sweet-grain malt aromas, but only light caramel if present at all. Belgian candi sugar may add to the sense of sweetness. Hop aromas should be moderate to high and will often carry the qualities of American/New World hops; citrus, piney, stone and tropical fruit. The earthy, spicy, and herbal aromas of European hops may also be present. May have a grassy character, an effect of dry-hopping. Fruity esters of apples, bananas, and pear can be moderately high, while clove-like phenols remain light, but often are noticeable. Mouthfeel: Body will vary somewhat depending on carbonation level and the use of adjuncts, but ranges from light to medium in most examples. Carbonation can range from medium to high and some warming may be noticeable in higher alcohol examples. Taste: The Belgian yeast often contributes an initial flavor of spice and esters; spicy and clove-like, along with esters of banana, apple, and pear. Maltiness stays light with a sweet-grain quality back-lit by possible low notes of caramel and/or toast. Hop flavors run medium to high and show much the same qualities as the aroma; tropical, melon, pine, citrus, and stone fruit of New World hops and/or the floral, spicy, herbal notes of Noble hops. Bitterness can be quite high and may be further heightened by the spiciness contributed by the Belgian yeast. It finishes dry to moderately dry with the possibility of some lingering sweetness. Food Pairing: The dry crispness and high bitterness of this beer works well with spicy heat. Try rare peppercorn rubbed beef steak, herb rubbed rabbit, spicy shrimp pasta, or spicy fish tacos. It’s also a good companion to many spicy food cultures; Asian, Indian, Mexican. Think Vietnamese spring rolls, chicken quesadillas, or curry. Look to sharp and tangy cheeses to pair with a Belgian IPA; sharp aged cheddar, goat cheeses, or blue. When it comes time to discuss desserts lighter and fruity such as pineapple upside down cake, crème brûlée, or rhubarb strawberry pie. Serving & Storage: For best presentation and greatest appreciation a Belgian IPA should be served at 48-50°F in a tulip glass or IPA glass. They are best stored at refrigerator temperatures away from light and should be enjoyed with 3 to 6 months of purchase or brewing. *Reference: The 2015 BJCP Style Guidelines Examples of the Style To help get you started, below are few popular examples of the Belgian IPA style. To get a better idea of what to expect, we would recommend you track one of these down and give it a taste. Houblon Chouffe from Brasserie D’achouffe (Houffalize, Belgium) Urthel Hop-It from Urthel Brewery (Ruiselede, Belgium) Raging Bitch from Flying Dog Brewing Company (Frederick, MD) Bitter Monk from Anchorage Brewing Company (Anchorage, Alaska) Hopsinjoor from Brouwerij Het Anker (Mechelen, Belgium) XX Bitter from Brouwerij De Ranke (Wevelgem, Belgium) Reninge Bitter Blond from Seizoensbrouwerij Vandewalle (Lo-Reninge, Belgium) Le Freak from Green Flash Brewing Company (San Diego, CA) Live A Rich Life from 3 Floyds Brewing Company (Munster, IN) Cali-Belgique IPA from Stone Brewing Company (Escondido, CA) Poperings hommel from Brouwerij Van Eecke N.V. (Watou, Belgium) Audrey Hopburn from Great Lakes Brewery (Toronto, Canada) Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster from Shorts Brewing Company (Bellaire, MI) Tripel Hop from Duvel Moortgat (Puurs, Belgium) Triomphe from Brewery Vivant (Grand Rapids, MI) How To Brew A Belgian IPA Recipe The BJCP guidelines style comparison for the Belgian IPA sums it up this way: “A cross between an American IPA/Imperial IPA with a Belgian Golden Strong Ale or Tripel. This style may be spicier, stronger, drier and more fruity than an American IPA.” This seems to be describing the most common way to build this IPA; make a big American IPA and ferment with Belgian yeast. But it could just as easily be simply a Belgian Blond, Golden Strong Ale, or Tripel recipe, hopped to a higher level with European hops. This, to my mind, would truly be a Belgian IPA. The other is more along the lines of an American-Belgian IPA. And then, of course, there are combinations of the two that provide each country a closer-to-equal representation across the ingredients, i.e. using American grain with European hops or European grain with American hops. Really, the only inescapable constant is the Belgian yeast. Recipe Options for Belgian IPA: Start With An American IPA Recipe Or, Go With A Belgian Golden or Tripel Recipe If you’re thinking of trying your hand at brewing a Belgian IPA recipe, here’s a few tips to help you throughout the brewing process. Grain Bill: The grain bill is going to depend on what base style you’ve decided on. If making the American version, start with a strong American IPA recipe. Domestic 2-row or pale malt will likely make up, anywhere from 80 to 100 percent of your grain bill. You want some low malt flavors, but very few roaster tones. Keep use of specialty malts constrained. Crystal malt should be used sparingly, making up less than 5% of the grain bill. For a Belgian IPA, you can use any strong pale Belgian recipe; a Golden, Tripel, even some Saison recipes will work. In this case, your base malt will be either a Belgian pilsner and/or pale malt at 60 to 100 percent of your grain bill. As with the American recipe, specialty malts should be used with care; little to no crystal/caramel type malts, no darker roasty malts, low quantities of aromatic, light Munich, even Belgian biscuit can work. In both versions, you are looking for a drier beer to accentuate the hop profile. To this end, and especially, when making a higher alcohol version of the style, some sort of adjunct sugar is often used. In the case of the Belgian recipes, adjunct sugar is already an important part and can make up as much as 30% of a recipe’s bill. Adjunct sugars can also be used in the American version, often these sugars are already a part of a double IPA recipe, but usually only make up about 10% of the bill. And, if you really want to go off script totally, you could try an English-Belgian IPA. English grains, English hops, and Belgian yeast. For extract brewers, a good place to start is either with a Belgian Golden or Tripel recipe kit, or an American IPA kit. You than would add more hops to the Belgian kit and exchange the yeast in the American IPA kit for a Belgian yeast. It might also be necessary to buy some extra extract, depending on the strength of beer you’re looking to make. Be sure to buy high-quality extract made from the right kind of malt. You might also try a steep or mini-mash with a small portion of the appropriate specialty malts to add more character. Hops: Hop selection is a wide open door on this one. You can base the varieties on your chosen base beer, or veer off on some crazy inspired journey. One thing to keep in mind; certain hop varieties pair better with certain Belgian yeast strains. There’s a possibility of either hops or the Belgian yeast muting the other or clashing in some terrible way. Learn How to Brew Like A Monk Generally speaking, if you are looking at an American IPA recipe you’d use American hop varieties; but think nuanced, think in whispers and not shouts. It is more likely to be the bold intrusive flavors of many American hops muting the Belgian profile or setting the flavors to clashing. There are plenty of hop varieties out there and I’d hazard to say, in most cases, fruity/floral/spicy is going to play a whole lot better with Belgian yeast than piney/dank/pungent. This will be less of a problem if you’re using European hops. Most European hop varieties have something of the noble hop character, which is what’s found in many Belgian Ales. Use the noble hops or other Belgian or German varieties. Overall, you’re gonna be looking to use clean bittering varieties for your early additions and subtle aroma varieties in your later additions. The Mash: The mash is also going to depend on your grain bill. If you’ve gone the American route, you can likely get away with a single infusion mash. You may want to use a lower saccharification temperature to get more body and help with head formation; 145-149°F might be a good target. If you’re using European grains, it is a good idea to do a step mash. European grains are often less modified than American malts and can benefit from the extra temperature steps. Plus, you’re looking for that pillowy head and great body of a Belgian beer, and most Belgian brewers use a step mash to get these signature characteristics. For a multi-step mash, start with a slightly thicker grist 1 quart per pound of grain. A rest at 131-137°F for 20 to 30 minutes will help get some of the longer proteins broken down. Then add enough boiling water to raise the temperature to about 145°F — this will also thin the mash. Hold for another 15 to 20 minutes. Then raise the temperature up to 155°F for 15 to 20 minutes. Mash out at 168°F and sparge. Boil: The boil should range from a standard 60 minutes up to a slightly longer 90 minute boil, if your grain bill is heavy on the pilsner malt. Add any adjunct sugar here. Hop schedules vary widely, just like any other IPA recipe. All will contain at least one bittering addition (60 to 30 minutes), one flavor addition (30 to 15 minutes), and one aroma addition (within the last 5 minutes). Most will contain multiples of some or all of these additions, and many also take advantage of dry hopping. Be sure to maintain a vigorous boil and don’t lid it completely. Also, remember with a vigorous boil, you should expect to lose anywhere from 6% to 8% of your volume per hour. Account for this, so that at the end of your boil you hit your target fermentation volume. Yeast: Yeast is the one commonality across the Belgian IPA style. No matter what the rest of your recipe looks like, the yeast should be a Belgian variety. And again, one of the biggest challenges to getting a drinkable Belgian IPA is finding compatibility between the hops and the yeast. You want a dry fermenting yeast, because you want a drier beer to accentuate the hops. This character isn’t very hard to find among Belgian yeast strains. You’ll also want to look at their ester and phenol productions. You’ll want a more neutral yeast for an American interpretation. Remember though, ester and phenol production can be managed to some extent by pitch rate and fermentation temperature, so don’t completely discount a favorite Belgian yeast just because it’s known for having a high ester/phenol production. In most cases, the more healthy yeast you pitch and the cooler the fermentation temperatures, the more neutral the yeast profile. A few examples of yeasts that would work: Dry Yeast: Safbrew Abbaye (BE-256) or Mangrove Jack’s Belgian Tripel (M31) White Labs: Abbey Ale (WLP530) or Belgian Strong Ale (WLP545) Wyeast: Belgian Ardennes (3522) or Belgian Abbey (1214) Fermentation: Oxygenate your wort once you’ve cooled it down to pitching temperatures and pitch plenty of healthy yeast. Remember, you’re going to a higher alcohol which will stress the yeast more. If this is your first go at brewing this style, I’d suggest fermenting at the cooler end of your yeasts range to get a more neutral character, especially if using an American or Double IPA recipe. If using European hops, you may try going slightly warmer, but I’d still play it cool your first time out. Packaging: Bottle or keg, and carbonate to between 2.5 and 3.5 volumes. The higher carbonation levels should be used for the Belgian-style versions. You want to make sure you have thick bottles if carbonating at these higher levels. The high ABV and hop rate of this style lends itself to some aging, though you also have to keep in mind, hop flavor and aroma will degrade over time. If you have the inclination to let it age — or you made too much — don’t worry, your Belgian IPA can age gracefully for at least 3 to 6 months, if not longer.

31	What are the educational objectives of teaching flag protocol in schools, and how do teachers monitor student progress throughout these lessons?	The educational objectives include teaching flag etiquette, the Pledge of Allegiance, patriotism, and good citizenship as mandated by the Florida State Legislature. Teachers monitor student progress through formative assessments that provide non-threatening results and immediate feedback. These include methods like fist-to-five self-evaluation, two stars and a wish feedback, and 3-2-1 reflection activities. The assessments help evaluate engagement, uncover misconceptions, and assess small parts of learning while preparing students for success on summative assessments.	"[""Editor's Note: Tom Piazze is a retired Lieutenant Colonel, United States Army and is currently the chair of the Stars & Stripes Foundation.\nAt its annual meeting in November 2012, the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) presented to its membership for approval a list of 14 resolutions that would guide its efforts for the foreseeable future. One of those resolutions focused on future actions MOAA would take to stimulate respect and loyalty for the United States Constitution and American flag among the general public. This same resolution encouraged MOAA Chapters across the country to sponsor efforts to educate America’s schoolchildren on the origin and meaning of the flag, flag etiquette, and patriotism.\nI was intrigued by this particular part of the resolution because I assumed these subjects were already being taught in Florida schools, much like they were when I and my children were in elementary school.\nA quick bit of online research confirmed that the Florida State Legislature mandates flag instruction, with emphasis on flag etiquette, the Pledge of Allegiance, the Constitution, patriotism, the free enterprise system and good citizenship. However, in follow-on conversations I had with Sarasota County School District administrators, I learned that many elementary schools in Sarasota County are not able to comply with this requirement due to a lack of resources.\nHonoring our country through a Flag Initiative\nThe announcement of The Patterson Foundation's Legacy of Valor campaign in 2013, and its overarching goals of honoring veterans, inspiring patriotism and embracing freedom, offered a real opportunity to correct this deficiency.\nWith the approval of the Military Officers Association of Sarasota board of directors and as part of the Legacy of Valor campaign, I submitted a concept to The Patterson Foundation suggesting that MOAS take the lead in orchestrating the development and execution of a multi-faceted educational program that focused on the origin and history of the American Flag and the proper etiquette and respect that should be afforded it. The concept was accepted pending further development.\nThe centerpiece of the American Flag Protocol Initiative has to be its academic curriculum, which consists of 10 50-minute lessons, nine of which are to be presented to 4th and 5th grade students throughout Sarasota and Manatee counties by their assigned teachers at some point during the academic year. The first nine lessons include the following topics:\nLessons 1-2: Understanding the origin of the American Flag\nLesson 3: Meaning of the Flag\nLesson 4: American Flag Timeline\nLessons 5-6: Importance of Patriotism\nLesson 7: Respect for the Flag\nLessons 8-9: Showing Respect/Retiring the Flag\nLesson 10 is presented by a visiting instructional team comprised of a volunteer veteran, JROTC Cadets from the Sarasota Military Academy, Sarasota, Booker, Riverview or North Port high schools or the Young Marines Program from Venice Middle School and Senior Level Scouts from the Girl Scouts of Gulfcoast Florida.\nThe lesson is designed to include a brief review and “knowledge check” of the material contained in the first nine lessons, a flag-folding demonstration and exercise that allows all students to do some hands-on training, and a brief presentation regarding service to country and community given by the veteran. Finally, a short graduation ceremony includes awarding Certificates of Completion and brochures entitled “Old Glory” to all participating students by the veteran representative.\nBuilding on success\nThe academic curriculum was launched in October 2013 with 22 elementary school teachers representing 10 of Sarasota County’s 27 elementary schools participating in instructor training. To date, more than 1,100 4th and 5th grade students from Sarasota County have received Certificates of Completion. We anticipate that this number will grow significantly as more and more teachers from elementary schools in Sarasota County learn of the program and its benefits to citizen development. The curriculum is even included on EdExploreSRQ.com, a website created by Sarasota County Schools in partnership with The Patterson Foundation to connect teachers to curriculum-aligned experiences in our region.\nIt is important to mention that the entire curriculum was designed to be exportable and was made available to other MOAA Chapters nationwide for implementation in their local school systems. Currently, MOAA Chapters located in Highlands, Volusia, and Manatee counties in Florida received the curriculum and chapters in Kansas, Georgia, Connecticut, Missouri, Arkansas and Minnesota report that they are also beginning work to implement the curriculum in their hometowns.\nEarlier this year, two members of the curriculum development committee (and teachers at Lamarque Elementary School in North Port) that developed the Flag Initiative curriculum were invited to host a breakout session entitled, “How did the US Flag Evolve,” at the 2016 National Council for History Education Crossing Borders Conference April 21-23 in Niagara Falls, NY. Teachers, historians and university faculty from around the country will also learn of our efforts, receive various pre-made flag lessons, including historical documents, and hopefully be encouraged to start their own programs in their local areas.\nFor more information regarding The American Flag Protocol Initiative, and other components of the program, please visit our website at www.starsandstripescelebration.com.\nLearn about these and other concepts used in TPF's approach to philanthropy.\nSHARE THIS POST:"", 'Presentation on theme: ""TEXAS REGIONAL COLLABORATIVES for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teaching Conference for the Advancement of Science Teaching Dallas, Texas November.""— Presentation transcript:\nTEXAS REGIONAL COLLABORATIVES for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teaching Conference for the Advancement of Science Teaching Dallas, Texas November 17-19, 2011 Kathleen Jeremiassen Formative Assessment for Engagement & Learning\nFormative Assessment for Engagement & Learning: PART of the WHOLE Kathleen Jeremiassen Irma Dru Hutchison Elementary Lamar CISD\n“... the most basic elements of an effective lesson: an essential, clearly defined learning objective followed by careful modeling or a clear sequence of steps, punctuated by: efforts during the lesson to see how well students are paying attention and/or learning the material.” -- Mike Schmoker, Results Now\nSounds simple, right?

32	I need to build a fence around my pond. How can geometry help?	Geometry can help you calculate the distance around the edge of your pond to determine exactly how much fencing you need to buy. This is one of the practical applications of geometry, along with calculating surface areas for painting, measuring box volumes, and dividing farm land into equal parts.	"['Geometry is a kind of mathematics that studies the size, shapes, and positions of things. There are flat (2D) shapes and solid (3D) shapes in geometry. Squares, circles and triangles are some of the simplest shapes in flat geometry. Cubes, cylinders, cones and spheres are simple shapes in solid geometry.\nGeometry can be used to calculate the size and shape of many things. For example, geometry can help people find:\n- the surface area of a house, so they can buy the right amount of paint\n- the volume of a box, to see if it is big enough to hold a liter of food\n- the area of a farm, so it can be divided into equal parts\n- the distance around the edge of a pond, to know how much fencing to buy.\nGeometry began as the art of measuring the shape of land so that it could be shared fairly between people. The word ""geometry"" means ""to measure the land"". It has grown from this to become one of the most important parts of mathematics. The Greek mathematician Euclid wrote the first book about geometry. Geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics.\nGeometry starts with a few simple ideas that are thought to be true, called axioms. Such as:\n- A point is shown on paper by touching it with a pencil or pen, without making any sideways movement. We know where the point is, but it has no size.\n- A straight line is the shortest distance between two points. For example, Sophie pulls a piece of string from one point to another point. A straight line between the two points will follow the path of the tight string.\n- A plane is a flat surface that does not stop in any direction. For example imagine a wall that extends in all directions infinitely.\nImportant concepts in geometry\nThe following are some of the most important concepts in geometry.\n- See also: Euclidean geometry\nEuclid took an abstract approach to geometry in his Elements, one of the most influential books ever written. Euclid introduced certain axioms, or postulates, expressing primary or self-evident properties of points, lines, and planes. He proceeded to rigorously deduce other properties by mathematical reasoning. The characteristic feature of Euclid\'s approach to geometry was its rigor, and it has come to be known as axiomatic or synthetic geometry. At the start of the 19th century, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries by Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky (1792–1856), János Bolyai (1802–1860), Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) and others led to a revival of interest in this discipline, and in the 20th century, David Hilbert (1862–1943) employed axiomatic reasoning in an attempt to provide a modern foundation of geometry.\nPoints are considered fundamental objects in Euclidean geometry. They have been defined in a variety of ways, including Euclid\'s definition as \'that which has no part\' and through the use of algebra or nested sets. In many areas of geometry, such as analytic geometry, differential geometry, and topology, all objects are considered to be built up from points. However, there has been some study of geometry without reference to points.\nEuclid described a line as ""breadthless length"" which ""lies equally with respect to the points on itself"". In modern mathematics, given the multitude of geometries, the concept of a line is closely tied to the way the geometry is described. For instance, in analytic geometry, a line in the plane is often defined as the set of points whose coordinates satisfy a given linear equation, but in a more abstract setting, such as incidence geometry, a line may be an independent object, distinct from the set of points which lie on it. In differential geometry, a geodesic is a generalization of the notion of a line to curved spaces.\nA plane is a flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely far. Planes are used in every area of geometry. For instance, planes can be studied as a topological surface without reference to distances or angles; it can be studied as an affine space, where collinearity and ratios can be studied but not distances; it can be studied as the complex plane using techniques of complex analysis; and so on.\nEuclid defines a plane angle as the inclination to each other, in a plane, of two lines which meet each other, and do not lie straight with respect to each other. In modern terms, an angle is the figure formed by two rays, called the sides of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the vertex of the angle.\nIn Euclidean geometry, angles are used to study polygons and triangles, as well as forming an object of study in their own right. The study of the angles of a triangle or of angles in a unit circle forms the basis of trigonometry.\nA curve is a 1-dimensional object that may be straight (like a line) or not; curves in 2-dimensional space are called plane curves and those in 3-dimensional space are called space curves.\nIn topology, a curve is defined by a function from an interval of the real numbers to another space. In differential geometry, the same definition is used, but the defining function is required to be differentiable Algebraic geometry studies algebraic curves, which are defined as algebraic varieties of dimension one.\nA surface is a two-dimensional object, such as a sphere or paraboloid. In differential geometry and topology, surfaces are described by two-dimensional \'patches\' (or neighborhoods) that are assembled by diffeomorphisms or homeomorphisms, respectively. In algebraic geometry, surfaces are described by polynomial equations.\nA manifold is a generalization of the concepts of curve and surface. In topology, a manifold is a topological space where every point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to Euclidean space. In differential geometry, a differentiable manifold is a space where each neighborhood is diffeomorphic to Euclidean space.\nTopologies and metrics\nA topology is a mathematical structure on a set that tells how elements of the set relate spatially to each other. The best-known examples of topologies come from metrics, which are ways of measuring distances between points. For instance, the Euclidean metric measures the distance between points in the Euclidean plane, while the hyperbolic metric measures the distance in the hyperbolic plane. Other important examples of metrics include the Lorentz metric of special relativity and the semi-Riemannian metrics of general relativity.\nCompass and straightedge constructions\nClassical geometers paid special attention to constructing geometric objects that had been described in some other way. Classically, the only instruments allowed in geometric constructions are the compass and straightedge. Also, every construction had to be complete in a finite number of steps. However, some problems turned out to be difficult or impossible to solve by these means alone, and ingenious constructions using parabolas and other curves, as well as mechanical devices, were found.\nWhere the traditional geometry allowed dimensions 1 (a line), 2 (a plane) and 3 (our ambient world conceived of as three-dimensional space), mathematicians have used higher dimensions for nearly two centuries. Dimension has gone through stages of being any natural number n, possibly infinite with the introduction of Hilbert space, and any positive real number in fractal geometry. Dimension theory is a technical area, initially within general topology, that discusses definitions; in common with most mathematical ideas, dimension is now defined rather than an intuition. Connected topological manifolds have a well-defined dimension; this is a theorem (invariance of domain) rather than anything a priori.\nThe issue of dimension still matters to geometry, in the absence of complete answers to classic questions. Dimensions 3 of space and 4 of space-time are special cases in geometric topology. Dimension 10 or 11 is a key number in string theory. Research may bring a satisfactory geometric reason for the significance of 10 and 11 dimensions.\nThe theme of symmetry in geometry is nearly as old as the science of geometry itself. Symmetric shapes such as the circle, regular polygons and platonic solids held deep significance for many ancient philosophers and were investigated in detail before the time of Euclid. Symmetric patterns occur in nature and were artistically rendered in a multitude of forms, including the graphics of M. C. Escher. Nonetheless, it was not until the second half of 19th century that the unifying role of symmetry in foundations of geometry was recognized. Felix Klein\'s Erlangen program proclaimed that, in a very precise sense, symmetry, expressed via the notion of a transformation group, determines what geometry is. Symmetry in classical Euclidean geometry is represented by congruences and rigid motions, whereas in projective geometry an analogous role is played by collineations, geometric transformations that take straight lines into straight lines. However it was in the new geometries of Bolyai and Lobachevsky, Riemann, Clifford and Klein, and Sophus Lie that Klein\'s idea to \'define a geometry via its symmetry group\' proved most influential. Both discrete and continuous symmetries play prominent roles in geometry, the former in topology and geometric group theory, the latter in Lie theory and Riemannian geometry.\nA different type of symmetry is the principle of duality in projective geometry (see Duality (projective geometry)) among other fields. This meta-phenomenon can roughly be described as follows: in any theorem, exchange point with plane, join with meet, lies in with contains, and you will get an equally true theorem. A similar and closely related form of duality exists between a vector space and its dual space.\nIn the nearly two thousand years since Euclid, while the range of geometrical questions asked and answered inevitably expanded, the basic understanding of space remained essentially the same. Immanuel Kant argued that there is only one, absolute, geometry, which is known to be true a priori by an inner faculty of mind: Euclidean geometry was synthetic a priori. This dominant view was overturned by the revolutionary discovery of non-Euclidean geometry in the works of Bolyai, Lobachevsky, and Gauss (who never published his theory). They demonstrated that ordinary Euclidean space is only one possibility for development of geometry. A broad vision of the subject of geometry was then expressed by Riemann in his 1867 inauguration lecture Über die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen (On the hypotheses on which geometry is based), published only after his death. Riemann\'s new idea of space proved crucial in Einstein\'s general relativity theory, and Riemannian geometry, that considers very general spaces in which the notion of length is defined, is a mainstay of modern geometry.\nGeometry Facts for Kids.

33	I've read that some ancient societies were very flexible in terms of social mobility. Could you explain how social status and class worked in Greek and Aztec societies, and whether people could move between different social classes?	In ancient Greek and Aztec societies, there were different approaches to social mobility. In the Aztec empire, despite having a clear division between nobles (pilli) and commoners (macehual), there were opportunities for social advancement. Commoners who proved themselves in battle could be elevated to noble status, becoming part of what was called a 'nobility of service.' The Aztecs also had a special class of merchants called Pochteca who, while technically commoners, gained significant wealth and power, though they sometimes had to hide their wealth from rulers. In contrast, the ancient Greeks of the Heroic Age emphasized patrilineal descent and genealogy, with clans trying to link themselves to legendary family lines. However, the surviving legends show that power could be acquired through marriage alliances, particularly by marrying the daughter of a king, suggesting that marriage was an important path to gaining status and power in Greek society.	"['Like the traditional poetry of other peoples, the traditional poetry of the Greeks celebrated the Heroic Age. This was the time when men were bigger and stronger, and they performed marvelous feats of prowess. Their weapons were made of bronze and not of iron, and they were ruled by kings. … The Heroic Age came to an end in two great wars – the Theban and the Trojan. … This was how the Mycenaean Greek civilization of the second millennium BC was remembered in historic Greece.\nMargalit Finkelberg. Greeks and Pre-Greeks\nClassical Greek poetry concerned with the Heroic Age includes a lot of genealogy, with an emphasis on descent in the male line, much like the begats in the Bible. Modern readers familiar with the Iliad and Odyssey find this stuff pretty boring, but it mattered a lot to the Greeks, who would try to link their existing patrilineal clans to the legendary family lines of the Heroic Age.\nAn emphasis on patrilineal descent is a general feature of early Indo-European society and its later offshoots, including the Greeks; the Indo-European expansion is one phase of the Patriarchal Age, leaving its imprint particularly on the distribution of Y chromosome variants. But given this patrilineal focus, there is something odd about the legends of the Heroic Age. In virtually none of the surviving legends do we find kingship passing from father to son, even when there is a son around. Instead, the normal pattern is that the king’s successor is the guy who marries his daughter – in other words his son-in-law, not his son. Meanwhile, the king’s son has to marry elsewhere. (Although the legends seem to present some cases of rotating succession, where multiple patrilineages took turns marrying into a matrilineage. In these cases, a king’s grandson might marry back into the kingdom, marrying his father’s sister’s daughter.) The implication is that the line of succession to the throne ran from mother to daughter, although it was the husbands of these women who actually exercised power: kingship by marriage. The most notable case of a son succeeding to his father’s throne is the exception that proves the rule: Oedipus got to be king of Thebes because he married Queen Jocasta, not because he was King Laius’ son. (Spoiler alert: see below*)\nIn Greeks and Pre-Greeks: Aegean Prehistory and Greek Heroic Tradition, Margalit Finkelberg argues that legends of the Heroic Age are memories of a time when the patrilineal traditions of the Greeks coexisted with earlier matrilineal traditions. More specifically, she argues that matrilineal Pre-Greek cultures were associated with the Anatolian language family, the first branch off the Indo-European tree, which also includes Hittite. On her account, Greece looks like ancestral Polynesia, a society flipped from matrilineal to patrilineal by invaders.\nFinkelberg is not the first person to notice possible survivals of matrilineal descent from before the coming of the Indo-Europeans and other folk. Such survivals led some nineteenth century scholars to theorize that matrilineality – tracing descent and succession through the female line – was a stage of social evolution that all societies passed through. Some scholars also believed that matrilineal societies were matriarchal – ruled by women. Neither of these theories has held up very well. And yet …\n… based on reconstructions of cultural phylogeny and/or ancestral vocabulary a number of the great demic expansions that covered the world seem to have started out matrilineal and/or matrilocal. The list (labelled by associated language families) includes:\nSo although matrilineal/matrilocal organization is not a stage that every society passes through, it is seems to be a phase in many demic expansions. This is actually not too surprising. One solid finding in the anthropology of kinship is that matrilocal societies, in which a man goes to live with his wife’s kin when he marries, tend to be internally peaceful, without a lot of feuding between neighboring villages in the same tribe. This makes sense, since the men are no more related to the men in their own village than they are to men in neighboring villages. At the same time, matrilocal societies are often quite war-like with respect folks outside the larger tribe (just ask the neighbors of the Iroquois or the Navajo). Since matrilocality and matrilineality (which tend to go together) are associated with internal peace and external aggression, this social organization is well-suited to life along an ethnic frontier. Matrilocality (which is strongly associated with matrilineality) is one way tribal societies generate the social solidarity that enables demic expansion.\nBut there are several limits to matrilocal solidarity. First, the introduction of stock herding tends to undermine matrilocality and matrilineality. (My late colleague Henry Harpending worked with a group, the Herero in southern Africa, who had taken up cattle herding, and were probably in the early stages of transition from matri- to patrilineal.) Also matrilocal/matrilineal societies rarely exceed a few tens of thousands of people. Beyond that size their internal unity tends to break down, and parents start insisting that married sons stick around to defend the homestead. So a lot of the later, better known population expansions, including Indo-European, Semitic, Turkic, and Han Chinese are heavily patrilineal. But even today, traces of earlier matrilineal social organization still survive in some places – in the matrilineal belt of Central Africa, and in some of South East Asia, where patrilineality, and mate guarding to secure the male line, mostly don’t reach the same intensity as in much of Asia.\n* Oedipus didn’t know it, but Jocasta was his mom.', 'Presentation on theme: ""The Mexica or Aztec: A Predatory State""— Presentation transcript:\n1 The Mexica or Aztec: A Predatory State Social, Political, and Economic OrganizationAll states are predatory, but some are more predator then others. Along with the Mongols under Genghis Kahn, and the Axis powers in World War II, The Aztecs or Mexica probably hold the record.\n2 Who Were the Aztec?We know they came from somewhere up north—how far north is anyone’s guessMythically, they came from “Aztlan, the Land of the Herons,” of which “Aztec” is a derivationThey were mercenaries of the Toltec centered in Tula, although even that is bound up in mythWhen Tula fell, the Aztec migrated to an area of five lakes dominated by Lake TexcocoAn area dominated by “Epigonal Toltecs”No one really knows where the Aztecs came from. Historical linguistic data and legend alike suggest they came from the north—but how far north or where is anyone’s guess. Mythically, they came from a place called “Aztlan,” or “Place of the Herons,” the name “Aztec” is derived from this place name. More likely, they lived in Tula for a while, acting as mercenaries for the Toltecs. With the fall of Tula, they migrated to Lake Texcoco, a lake near Mexico City which has since dried up. The area was dominated by what Wolf calls “Epigonal Toltecs.”\n3 Epigonal ToltecsThe first were the Otomi-speaking Tepanecs, who founded the city of Atzcapotzalco on the western shores of Lake TexcocoThe second was Xaltocan, an Otomi-speaking state on the north shore of Lake TexcocoThe third was the Acolhua who dominated the eastern shore of Lake Texcoco, organized also by ChichimecaThe fourth was Colhuacán on the southwest part of the Valley of Mexico, at the cusp between Lakes Texcoco and Xochimilco.The fifth was a small state Xicco.\n4 Aztec NomenclatureInitially, they did not settle at the site of TenochtitlanTheir names changed from “Chichimec from Aztlan” a contemptuous term that meant “Barbarian”To “Tenochca” after a patriarch by that name, who also gave the name to TenochtitlánTo “Mexica,” which they adopted after attaching themselves to the Colhua of Colhuacan as mercenaries, calling themselves “Colhua Mexica”\n5 Formation of the AztecInitially, they did not settle at the site of TenochtitlánAfter numerous wanderings they settled at a swampy site mythically where an eagle was perched on a nopal cactus devouring a snakeFirst, they served as mercenaries of AtzcapotzalcoThey then switched sides, allied themselves with the Acolhua of Texcoco, overthrew Atzapotzalco, and eventually formed a triple alliance between themselves, the Acolhua, and a liberated part of Atzapotzalco called TlacopanThird, they established hegemony in 1500, 21 years before the actual conquest.Although Tenochtitlan, at the site of today’s Mexico City, would become the capital of the Mexica (Aztec) empire.\n6 Formation and Society Bilateral descent does allow for flexibility. To enjoy a rapid rise from a muddy village settled in 1345 or so to an empire less than 200 years later, you have to be flexible.1427 saw the formation of the Triple AllianceSo to envision an “Aztec society,” the question arises just which society are we talking aboutBerdan describes society at it was on the eve of the ConquestBut were they patrilineal groups in the past? We don’t know; records were often destroyed by the victors\n7 What Were the Calpulli? What is known for sure: There were 20 “Big Houses” by that nameThey were landholding groupsThey were organized territoriallyThey had their own councilsThey had their own templesThey comprised the macehual, or commoner, generally peasantsThe debate: kin groups or peasant class?\n8 Calpulli as Kin Groups Kin groups or clans Reasoning: the Aztecs themselves were tribal groups at most 300 years beforeWhat kind? Evidence is lacking?Indication of a patrilineal bias among nobility: preference for “junior lines” in allocating economic assets and political favors.\n9 Calpulli as Social and Economic Classes Developed into administrative subclassesCould have been units organizing not only peasants but also craftspersons and tradersExample: in Texcoco under Hungry Coyote (Nezahualcoyotl), calpulli were organized featherworkers and goldworkersPochteca (luxury good traders) may also have formed a calpulli; we do know they were hereditary\n10 Calpulli as Both Kin and Class Conical clans in which privileges are based on order of birthKept wealth and privileges in the family, but some members were more equal than othersKin trace their ancestry to a founder, real or fictiveBut through such justification as precedence of birth, the lineal descendants (junior lines) get preferential treatmentThis suggests that unilineal descent might have been dominant at one time\n11 Calpulli and Ethnicity As conquests proceeded, Tenochtitlan became more ethnically diverse.Thus calpulli included not only kin but also “allies” from the conquered provincesFlexibility of kin thus allowed fictive (fictional) ties as wellThus, the European Catholic tradition of compradrazgo fit in very well with indigenous society.Thus their flexibility is not at issue; only their “pristine” characteristics.\n12 Calpulli and Land Tenure Land was held in common in the calpulliSystem was based on usufructPeasants “owned” their plot so long as they used it and paid their taxesLand reverted back to the commons if the peasant stopped using the land or pay the taxesLand could be rented, but not bought or sold\n13 Aztec: Kin ReckoningReckoned kinship bilaterally; traced relations through paternal and maternal side.Kinship terms bilateral: e.g. tlatli is an uncle, whether father’s or mother’s brotherPossibly reflected the extreme instability one expects from a state in rapid formationAnd one in which there are shifting alliances\n14 Marriage among the Aztec Marriage was endogamous by class: pipiltin to other pipiltin, macehuallin to other macehuallinThere was no other rule of exogamy outside the immediate familyThis meant that marriage could involve one’s cousin; cross-cousin marriage was not unknownPolygyny was common among nobility and tied in with social class; wives were put to work.\n15 Marriage Alliances and Power Nobility: Marriage had a political function: female from Texcoco married a male from the subordinate Teotihuacan to maintain a tieThe son of the Teotihuacan ruler would then be subordinate to Texcoco because of the “gift” of a wife.Marriage was to man’s mother’s brother’s daughter—his matrilateral cross-cousin.Failure to repay in Maussian terms means the Teotihuacan nobility would be “beggar” to Texcoco nobility.This would persist for generations.\n16 Aztec Markets: Common Goods There were two kinds of marketsOne dealt in ordinary goodsMarkets usually met every five daysTrading outside the market was illegal and one could be imprisoned or the goods confiscatedReason: market transactions were subject to taxati\n17 Aztec Markets: Luxury Products Texcoco had been a market town long before the Aztecs assumed powerMarkets were a daily affair in Texcoco; major markets comprising up to 50,000 buyers and sellers met every fifth day—they were the center of luxury productsA hereditary class of merchants called Pochteca were probably active long before the AztecsThey occupied a precarious positionOn the one hand, they were vital as sources of military intelligence to the rulers and were protectedOn the other hand, their economic power were a threat to the rulers; toward the end, they hid their wealth.\n18 Sociopolitical Organization of the Aztecs Society: A Twofold DivisionPilli: The noblesMacehual: The peasantsHowever, the peasants themselves were stratifiedMacehuales who excelled in battle could themselves become nobleThis requires some background in the principles of political anthropology\n19 Social Class: Overview General types (Fried)Egalitarian societies:Social systems with as many valued positions as person capable of filling themExceptions: age, gender, special characteristicsRanked societiesSocial systems with fewer valued status positions than those capable of filling themStratified societiesMinority control of strategic resources\n20 Stratified Societies Access to strategic resources is unequal Examples Water in irrigation societiesLand in patrimonial (feudal) societiesClaims to capital assets (stocks, bonds) in capitalist societyCapital: goods/services used for productionMoney, stocks, bonds are also capital\n21 Emergence of Stratification Manipulative Individuals/ FamiliesForm alliances (chimpanzee-like)Play one faction against anotherForm dynasties (bonobo-like)Control over Life-Sustaining ResourcesWater systems in semi-arid regionsAgricultural landsMechanisms of TaxationLaborTribute\n22 Political Organization: Basic Principles Power vs AuthorityPower: compliance by coercion or forceAuthority: compliance by persuasionLegitimacy: Beliefs rationalizing ruleExamples: Divine Right, Peoples ConsentSanctions: reinforcements of behaviorPositive: rewards, recognitionNegative: punishment\n23 Power versus Authority Extreme examplesPower: concentration camps: Auschwitz (above);

34	why and when did american armed forces switch to clock going beyond 12	The U.S. military adopted the 24-hour clock system at different times. The U.S. Navy began using it in 1920 after becoming familiar with it during World War I, while the U.S. Army officially adopted it in 1942. They switched to this system because military operations demand precision and the 24-hour clock eliminates any confusion between a.m. and p.m.	"['Military time is a 24-hour clock designed to avoid confusion between daytime and nighttime hours, since the armed forces are in operation around the clock.\nAlso called the ""24-clock,"" the system is commonly used in industries and professions in the United States and other parts of the world in which 24-hour operations are routine, including law enforcement, fire departments, hospitals, airlines and railroads.\nHow to Read Military Time\nThere is no a.m. or p.m. in military time, as numbers are not reused, but instead, each hour has its own number.\nAny given time of day is expressed in four digits. The day in military time begins at midnight with 0000, pronounced ""zero hundred hours"" or simply ""zero hundred.""\nYou then add one hundred for each hour, so 1 a.m. is 0100 (zero one hundred) hours, 2 a.m. is 0200 (zero two hundred) hours and so forth.\nIn the four-digit expression of time, no colon separates the hours and minutes. For example, 6:30 a.m. in civilian time is written simply as 0630 in military time.\nThe morning hours are simple enough to understand. This ease continues through midday, which is 1200 (twelve hundred) hours.\nRead More: Making Sense of Military Time\nThe military references to the afternoon and evening hours often take new enlistees in basic training longer to learn by heart.\nAfter noon, instead of starting over with 1, military time continues chronologically, so that 1 p.m. is 1300 hours, 2 p.m. is 1400 hours and so forth.\nThe day ends just before midnight at what civilians would call 11:59 p.m., but which in military time is 23:59, or twenty-three fifty-nine hours.\nFor those still learning the 24-clock system, a simple way to translate afternoon and evening hours into civilian time is to subtract 12. For example, for 2000 hours, subtract 12 from 20 to get 8 p.m.\nRead More: Military Lingo for New Military Spouses\nMilitary Time Chart\n24-Hour Military Time\nHow to Say Military Time\n|12 midnight||0000||Zero hundred (hours)|\n|1 a.m.||0100||Zero one hundred (hours)|\n|2 a.m.||0200||Zero two hundred (hours)|\n|3 a.m.||0300||Zero three hundred (hours)|\n|4 a.m.||0400||Zero four hundred (hours)|\n|5 a.m.||0500||Zero five hundred (hours)|\n|6 a.m.||0600||Zero six hundred (hours)|\n|7 a.m.||0700||Zero seven hundred (hours)|\n|8 a.m.||0800||Zero eight hundred (hours)|\n|9 a.m.||0900||Zero nine hundred (hours)|\n|10 a.m.||1000||Ten hundred (hours)|\n|11 a.m.||1100||Eleven hundred (hours)|\n|12 noon||1200||Twelve hundred (hours)|\n|1 p.m.||1300||Thirteen hundred (hours)|\n|2 p.m.||1400||Fourteen hundred (hours)|\n|3 p.m.||1500||Fifteen hundred (hours)|\n|4 p.m.||1600||Sixteen hundred (hours)|\n|5 p.m.||1700||Seventeen hundred (hours)|\n|6 p.m.||1800||Eighteen hundred (hours)|\n|7 p.m.||1900||Nineteen hundred (hours)|\n|8 p.m.||2000||Twenty hundred (hours)|\n|9 p.m.||2100||Twenty-one hundred (hours)|\n|10 p.m.||2200||Twenty-two hundred (hours)|\n|11 p.m.||2300||Twenty-three hundred (hours)|\nWhy Does the Military Use 24-Hour Time?\nOne of the main advantages of using military time is eliminating ambiguity.

35	As a microbiologist, I wonder how does the gut microbiome evolve and affect disease?	The gut microbiota develops to reach maturity after weaning and has profound effects on health and disease. During infancy, it plays a crucial role in immune system maturation and promoting physiological processes like mucosal integrity. The microbiota reaches a balanced equilibrium or 'climax status,' but this can be disrupted leading to dysbiosis. Disrupting feedback systems between microbiota and host can cause diseases like Crohn's disease. However, comparing microbiota communities is complex since they are highly variable over time and space - even identical twins differ considerably in gastrointestinal microbiota. Understanding these dynamics requires ecological approaches to analyze community structure, diversity and species abundance patterns.	"[""If you are not an astronomer (amateur or otherwise), looking at the stars can be an exercise in frustration. Where are the constellations? The planets? A telescope doesn't necessarily help: you can see things more clearly, but without knowing where to look and what to look for, you can't tell what you are seeing.\nA similar problem arises as we consider the microorganisms that inhabit the human body. Our microbiota (previously called microflora) have been studied by high-throughput DNA sequencing of their genomes. Each of us carries at least 100 times more genes in our microbiota than in our personal genome.1 There is so much there that it is hard to know where to look, and so the tendency is to explore more thoroughly what we already know, just as Galileo did when he first looked through a telescope. Galileo turned a telescope towards the moon and saw mountains; he looked at the Milky Way and saw separate stars; he looked at Jupiter and saw moons. But it took another century for astronomers to identify entirely new objects in the sky not proximate to those already known. The failure was not in the technology, but in pattern recognition. William Herschel—a musician turned astronomer—discovered a new way of seeing: reading the sky like a musical score, he mapped patterns in the sky, enabling him to discern deviations from those patterns, such as the previously undetected planet of Uranus.2\nThe initial applications of DNA sequencing in the study of microbiota focused on individual species, particularly those that cause disease. This emphasis on disease-causing organisms followed the lead of Leeuwenhoek and Koch. In the 3 centuries since Leeuwenhoek first peered at teeth scrapings under a microscope, and the century since Koch discovered how to grow bacteria in pure culture, microbiologists have focused on the morphology, physiology, and genetics of the small subset of the microorganisms in the body that are known to cause disease.\nMore recently, high-throughput sequencing has been directed toward the entire human microbiota. The International Human Microbiome Consortium and the Human Microbiome Project are characterizing the genomes of microbiota found on several sites in the normal human host (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/hmp/). The diversity of organisms is mind-boggling, as is the volume of data generated; literally thousands of sequence reads are generated per sample.3 While the potential for changing our understanding of health and disease is huge, at this stage, we have merely turned the telescope inwards and are still struggling to develop ways to see patterns and interpret them.\nWhy should epidemiologists care? It is already apparent that the human microbiota has profound effects on health and disease. Systems of feedbacks among the various microbes within a community, and between the microbial community and its human host, go far beyond the simple one-pathogen-one-disease model that was so successful in managing infectious diseases. The presence of microbes is essential for health maintenance. Consequently, disrupting the feedback systems between microbiota and host can be harmful: periodontal disease, bacterial vaginosis, and Crohn disease are all considered diseases of disrupted microbiota.\nWe understand little about the complex mechanisms that disrupt microbiota and result in disease. For example, antibiotic therapy changes the microbial community of the gastrointestinal tract,4 and undoubtedly also the microbiota found elsewhere in the body. These changes might alter expression of cytokines, antimicrobial peptides, or other host defense mechanisms, which, in turn, can increase risk of infection or development of chronic inflammation.5 But we are unable to predict the circumstances when antibiotic use will cause changes that lead to disease and when it will not. Similarly unpredictable are efforts to restore the microbiota to health. Total fecal “transplants” as a treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile (in which the normal microbiota is extremely disrupted) are successful about 70%–75% of the time.6,7 Why some are not successful though, is still a mystery.\nHow can we use microbial sequence data to learn how to restore the microbiota to “normal” (whatever that turns out to be)? The first step is simply to characterize how microbiota differ in healthy and disease states. However, this is a much more complex problem than looking for single pathogens as an indicator of disease, because it entails comparing entire assemblages of microbes with their various species of bacteria, phage, fungi, protists, etc. Even the seemingly-simple task of comparing the number of species in 2 samples turns out to be complicated—the number of species detected depends heavily on the sampling effort.8 (The definition of species is an even larger can of worms! But that is a subject for another commentary.)\nFortunately, the field of ecology has developed sophisticated methodological and computational tools to compare “community structure”—the diversity, composition, and relative abundance of species of trees in a hectare of forest, or of algae in a liter of lake water, or of bacteria in a gram of soil.9–11 These ecological approaches have been applied to the microbiota of the mouth,12 stomach,13 and skin,14 and they have been used to compare gastrointestinal microbiota among monozygotic and dizygotic twins15 and to characterize the community structure of lung bacteria among cystic fibrosis patients.16 Extending those ecological metrics of community structure to the huge volumes of genomic data from healthy and diseased microbiota will enable us to see beyond the simple presence or absence of particular species in assessing the impact of microorganisms on health.\nStatic snapshots of microbiota communities hold promise, but such description is just the first step. A key characteristic of ecological systems—whether tropical forests or human microbiota—is that they are highly variable over time and space. (The notion of a “balance of nature,” a finely-tuned equilibrium that is static in the absence of anthropogenic disturbance, has long since been discarded in modern ecology.17) It is already clear that microbiota in apparently healthy humans are quite variable; even identical twins differ considerably in gastrointestinal microbiota.15 How the microbiota of a single individual changes over time is less well known, although the structure of the microbial community of human skin for a given person is quite variable when tested 4–6 months later,18 as is the vaginal microbiota when sampled weekly over the course of the menstrual cycle.19 Quantifying the magnitude of temporal and spatial variability in the microbiota of healthy individuals is essential to understanding the wider role of the microbiome in health and disease. Especially important would be the discovery of changes in the microbiota community structure associated with later disease risk. It would be useful, for example, to be able to look at oral microbiota and identify children at high risk of developing caries, or to look at the gut microbiota and be able to predict for whom a course of antibiotics is most likely to cause chronic diarrhea.\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, data from the Human Microbiome Project and associated research can help to identify the mechanisms driving variations in the microbiome, and how this variation is associated with health and disease. A thorough understanding of such mechanisms will ultimately enable us to design appropriate prevention and treatment strategies for conditions that involve changes in the microbiota. Understanding the underlying disease mechanisms clearly requires knowledge of immunology, cell physiology, and molecular biology. These cellular and molecular mechanisms are, however, enabled by the structure of the microbial community present and community changes over time and space. Understanding community structure and dynamics is an ecological question, and so answering mechanistic questions also requires knowledge of ecology.\nEcologists have developed extensive theories to understand and interpret spatial-temporal variations in highly dynamic systems such as those in microbiota based on mechanisms, including dispersal, interactions among organisms, and direct physiological responses to environmental conditions. Epidemiologists are well aware of the critical importance of transmission of disease (“dispersal,” in ecological lingo), and already are collaborating with ecologists to develop models of transmission of single pathogens at the population level.20,21 The role of transmission in community dynamics of the microbiome is even more complex; however, ecologists have developed meta-community theory that could be applied to these systems. Interactions among microbes also can affect community dynamics, for example, through competition for nutrients, through mutualism and facilitation in biofilms, and through predation by phages. Ecological theory incorporating these mechanisms has been well-tested in relatively small systems; however, its application in highly-diverse systems is still extremely difficult. For example, resource competition theory has been successfully applied to systems of 2 competing species of algae or bacteria,22,23 but models falter in predictive capacity with even 3 or 4 interacting species.24,25 While modeling data on the dynamics of diverse communities is an active area of research, directly modeling human microbiome data using such mechanistic models is not likely to be useful in the short term.\nAn alternative is to use these models more heuristically in combination with patterns identified in human microbiome project data to generate hypotheses about mechanisms involving subsets of organisms. These hypotheses can then be tested experimentally. For example, Crohn disease is characterized by disrupted microbiota. Is this disruption due to transient microbes that invade the resident microbiota and subsequently change the community, which in turn modifies physiological function? Or do environmental factors (eg, diet) modify a resident community, which then leads to altered function, including perhaps greater susceptibility to invasion of transients? Appropriate interventions will differ depending on the answer. The design, conduct, and analysis of studies to differentiate among these alternatives will need both ecological and epidemiological expertise.\nIn order for epidemiologists to take full advantage of the new genomic data characterizing human microbiota, we believe that epidemiologists need to learn ecology. Like Herschel reading the stars, community ecology enables epidemiologists to interpret the patterns in microbiota data by providing strategies to link mechanisms to the complexity found in microbial communities. This, in turn, offers great potential to identify new diagnostic and prognostic indicators, mediators of disease processes, and clinical and population-level interventions.\nSuch studies will require huge data sets and complex study designs, given the extreme levels of variation in microbiota. Designing and conducting these studies is an epidemiological problem, but characterizing the microbial community structure and dynamics is an ecological problem. The analysis of such studies will need to go beyond the usual statistical approaches to incorporate dynamic mechanistic models with feedback systems that are common in ecology, and understanding the underlying mechanism(s) will require expertise in immunology and other disciplines.\nIn short, understanding the relationship of the microbiome to human health and disease will require a major interdisciplinary effort. Fortunately, putting together interdisciplinary teams is something epidemiologists also do well.\n1. Ley RE, Peterson DA, Gordon JI.

These interactions have various implications in terms of health and disease, and this multi-author review issue will address a number of selected aspects pertaining to gut microbiota research.\nKeywordsMicrobiota Microbiome Probiotic Gut commensals Diet & health\nHuman beings are colonized by complex microbial communities that influence and govern various biological processes during their entire lifespan. Within the human body, microbes reach their highest density in the intestinal tract, where they form a complex microbial community known as the gut microbiota . This gut microbiota develops during infancy of the host to reach its mature form following weaning [2, 3, 4]. The human gut microbiota in the early stages of life plays a pivotal role in the maturation and modulation of the host immune system, as well as in promoting various physiological processes in the human gut, such as the establishment of mucosal integrity and the mucus gel layer [5, 6].\nFurthermore, later in life the abundance and prevalence of particular members of the human gut microbiota continue to play a variety of roles in the maintenance of human health, for example, by (i) assisting in the breakdown of food components and liberation of nutrients that would otherwise be inaccessible to the host, (ii) promoting the differentiation of particular host tissues, (iii) reducing the risk of gut colonization by pathogens, and (iv), as already mentioned above, maturation and modulation of the immune system. As underlined by several studies, the development of the complex microbial assemblage within a specific ecological niche reaches a so-called climax status represented by the establishment of a balanced equilibrium of its microbial components . Numerous factors are known to cause shifts in the composition of the microbiota, thereby disrupting this microbial homeostasis and causing a state of dysbiosis. Dysbiosis is typically associated with having a negative impact on host health with long-term consequences, being associated with various disorders or diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and metabolic syndrome.\nHowever, despite the wealth of publications that support the key roles played by gut microbiota in host health maintenance and promotion, there are still substantial knowledge gaps related to the associated mechanisms of action. Another intriguing finding of the metagenomic era is represented by the identification of numerous, but as yet uncharacterized microbial taxa that have overwhelmed bacterial taxonomy. Such newly discovered taxa represent a challenging frontier for microbiology research that focuses on the development of methodologies for the isolation and cultivation of these novel microbes.\nThis multi-author review will cover a variety of topics, including the development of the gut microbiota following birth and the impact of antibiotics either prenatally or postnatally on these early microbial communities (see Nogacka et al.). In the context of early life microbiota, one particular group of gut commensals, the bifidobacteria, represents a dominant and prevalent microbial group. The contribution by Turroni et al. provides an overview of the ecological and biological role of bifidobacteria in the infant gut.\nThe multi-author review is counter-balanced by three articles focusing on gut microbiota composition in aging organisms, from flies to humans. The contribution by Clark and Walker presents a detailed overview of the role of gut microbiota in age-associated health decline as determined by the use of invertebrate models. In addition, in this context, the contribution by O’Toole and Jefferey provides insights into the composition of the gut microbiota of elderly, with particular emphasis on the role of microbial effector metabolites in host-signaling and impact on host health status. The contribution by Santoro et al. documents our current knowledge on gut microbiota composition at the extreme end of human life, namely in centenarians, providing relevant findings on the role of gut microbiota in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.\nFinally, comparative analysis of gut commensals found in two different mammalian species, humans and mice, revealed that they had a relatively small number of microorganisms in common (Hugenholtz and de Vos), and reminds us that extreme caution should be taken when findings from murine analyses are being extrapolated to humans.\n(1) Early microbiota, antibiotics and health.

36	I'm researching different pizza making methods - what are the key differences between using a traditional wood-fired setup versus a kamado-style grill for cooking pizzas?	In a wood-fired setup, you need kiln-dried hardwood logs for fuel and the fire is positioned next to the pizza with smoke exiting through a chimney. In contrast, with a kamado grill like the Shokunin, the fire is placed below the pizza using charcoal and wood chunks, which adds subtle wood flavor since the smoke passes over the pizza. Both systems can reach high temperatures (750°F in the kamado, over 930°F in wood-fired) and cook pizzas in 3 minutes.

Use it to smoke, roast, bake and grill with a flavorful charcoal and wood fire. One of our favorite things to cook in the Shokunin is pizza. Because of the amazing efficiency of the Shokunin’s insulated design, it is easy to maintain a 750°F baking temperature for hours at a time. At this temperature, you can make a perfect pizza in just three minutes.\nThis simple guide to baking pizzas in Kalamazoo’s kamado grill will walk you through the tools, steps and techniques needed for a successful artisan pizza night at home.\nThis two-piece baking deck creates an air gap for more gentle heat.\nTHE TOOLS YOU’LL NEED\nThe most important tool you’ll need is a hollow-core baking deck or pizza stone. The cordierite two-piece deck from PizzaCraft is ideal for balancing the heat and preventing the bottom of the pizza from cooking too quickly. Make sure your pizza stone is no more than 16 inches in diameter.\nIf your pizza stone is solid, without an air gap, you can use an aluminum pizza screen between the pizza and the stone to slow down the cooking.\nA perforated pizza peel, like the one included in Kalamazoo’s Pizza Master’s Essentials Kit (PMEK), is very helpful in transferring the assembled pizza into the grill. A wooden pizza peel, or even a thin cutting board can also be used. The PMEK also includes a pair of dough boxes that are helpful when resting the dough prior to shaping the crust.\nOnce the pizza has cooked, you can lift it out of the grill with a large grill turner or spatula, or you can use a pizza peel.\nPizza cooking with a pizza screen on top of the stone.\nA chimney starter gets the charcoal started quickly with no chemicals.\nSETTING UP THE GRILL\nConfigure your grill with the fire grate placed in the highest of the three positions. Because of the tapered interior shape of the Shokunin, you’ll want to slide each part of the two-piece adjustable fire grate to the outside (far left and far right) of the grill. Pile a little hardwood lump charcoal in each of the four corners of the grill.\nOpen all four vents (two supply vents in the base of the grill and two exhaust vents in the lid) to the wide-open positions.\nStarting the Fire\nFill the chimney starter with more lump charcoal. We typically use a paper grocery sack to start the chimney, but you can also use paraffin fire starters. To use paper, loosely wad it up and put it inside the bottom of the chimney starter. Place the chimney starter in the center of the fire grate, then use the plumber’s torch to light the paper on fire. Leave the grill lid open and the cooking grates flipped up out of the way while the charcoal starts, about 15 minutes.\nOnce the fire has travelled all the way up the chimney and the coals at the top are burning, it is time to distribute them in the grill. Use long, protective gloves to pour the burning coals out of the chimney starter and onto the unlit charcoal that was positioned earlier. You want to keep all of the charcoal positioned toward the corners of the fire grate so that the heat envelopes the pizza and reflects down from the inner curvature of the lid.\nOnce the charcoal is distributed, you can add wood chunks or small wood splits on top of the charcoal. The wood will boost the heat and add subtle wood flavor to the pizza. (Unlike a wood-fired pizza oven, where the fire is next to the pizza and the smoke travels out the chimney, the fire in the Shokunin is below the pizza so the flavor is noticeable.)\nNow you can lower the cooking grates into position and place the pizza stone in the center of the cooking grate.\nClose the lid and preheat the grill to 750°F, about an hour of preheating time.\nCOOKING THE PIZZA\nAssemble your pizza on the countertop, then transfer to the pizza stone using a pizza peel (see tips that follow). Close the lid and start a three-minute timer. The pizza will cook evenly from all sides and does not need to be rotated in the Shokunin. With a hollow-core pizza stone, the pizza will cook untouched for three minutes.\nWith a solid stone, check the pizza after one minute. If the crust has “set” and the pizza is easily moved, gently lift it off the stone and slide a pizza screen into position. Close the lid and continue cooking for the remaining two minutes.\nRemove the pizza when done and let rest for a minute before slicing.\nPIZZA MAKING TIPS\nBecause we are cooking pizzas quickly at a high temperature, use a pizza dough made in whole or in part with Tipo ‘00 flour. This is the flour used in traditional Neapolitan pizzas. Our Artisan Fire Pizza Dough recipe is perfect for cooking in the Shokunin.\nPizza dough needs to relax before stretching, and ideally needs to come up to room temperature. We recommend keeping dough balls in the dough box at room temperature for three to four hours before making pizza. A seven to ten ounce dough ball size is good for working with a 14-inch diameter pizza stone.\nWhen forming the pizza, be gentle with the dough. You want to avoid “bruising” it and creating areas that can’t form air pockets inside as the crust bakes. We form our pizzas by hand rather than using a rolling pin. The dough can be formed to a flat disc. There is no need to form it with a raised crust around the outside. The heat of the grill will do that for you.\nThe first two minutes of this pizza making video includes tips for stretching the dough and getting the assembled pizza onto the pizza peel.\nOur Favorite Pizza Recipes\nThese recipes are all written for the Artisan Fire Pizza Oven, but are easily cooked in the Shokunin following the directions above.

37	how does burning tokens work in proof of burn consensus	Proof of burn involves burning tokens by sending them to unrecoverable addresses in a way that is easy to verify and extremely hard to undo. The implicit cost is the tokens that become unspendable, and it's sometimes used to add value to new tokens under the belief that burning a valuable token adds its implicit value to the newly generated token.	['Proof of Work, Proof of Stake and Proof of Burn\nLearn the differences between the colloquially accepted meaning of different proofs within the cryptocurrency world of Bitcoin, Ethereum and then some.\nThis article aims to deliver a basic understanding of the following proofs and the nature around its observance. For all reasons unless explicitly specified, we shall refer to the oldest cryptocurrency in use, Bitcoin.\nProof of Work:\nThe concept of proof of work has existed long before blockchains did.\nPeople are often asked to describe the nature of or show their previous work to correctly assess their implicit value. Bitcoin employs a puzzle friendly implementation of a one way hashing algorithm (SHA256) where the initial characters of the to-be generated hash is predefined.\nOn any input provided to this one way hashing algorithm, the outcome is always a 256 bits or 64 characters in hex format.\nSample SHA 256 Output looks like this:\nThe algorithm is designed such that every slight change in the input results in the output being completely different bearing no resemblance to its input.\nA live demo of how one way hashes work can be found here, by Anders.\nThe nature of one way hashing algorithms is to bear no resemblance to its input. A one way hash function is a deterministic algorithm implying that a given input will always yield its corresponding output and none other.\nAn ideal one way hash function has no collisions. Given that a specific input always returns a specific output, in order to obtain a different output, the input must change. In bitcoin, the designed puzzle is such that a person must recursively hash until they obtain a hash whose initial digits/characters have already been specified.\nThe difficulty of obtaining a hash that matches the specific pattern increases exponentially as the number of specific digits increases.\nIn the case of Bitcoin, we can observe on a blockexplorer how the hash of each block from genesis block (block 0) lead with a couple of zeros.\nThis pattern of obtaining a series of zeroes to lead a hash gets harder as a longer series is demanded. The series of zeros leading a hash required is often used synonymously with the difficulty level.\nBlock 1 leads with 8 zeros and the computation required for finding the hashthat leads with 8 zeros is a lot lesser than the computation required to find the hash of block 505751 that leads with 19 zeros.\nFinding the hash involves recursively passing the elements of the proposed block through the hashing function to test for a hash that matches the proposed difficulty and the difficulty level resets every 2016 blocks, roughly about 2 weeks.\nThe proof of work employed in bitcoin was required to be easy to verify but hard to arrive at. This is solved by using a nonce.A nonce is a non repeating number.\nA nonce is included along with other contents of a block and is fed as input to the hashing algorithm. Upon obtaining a hash, if the hash does not correspond to the difficulty level, the nonce is increased by one and hashed again until a hash that appropriately corresponds to the difficulty level is obtained.\nThis nonce once obtained can be hashed along with the rest of the block’s contents to obtain the hash to verify. This verification process wouldn’t take much time, but in order to come up with the nonce, one must hash the contents of the block and try various multiple iterations to obtain the nonce.\nThis implies that verification is extremely easy whereas coming up with the nonce in the first place is quite a laborious process.\nUpon finding the nonce, the block containing the nonce is hence broadcasted to other bitcoin nodes on the network along with the hash to verify.\nThe whole process of finding the nonce is described as proof of work.\nThe nonce is the proof of work to establish that a miner has actually tried computing various iterations before arriving at this number and hence receives a block reward.\nThis has been adopted from HashCash\nProof of Stake:\nProof of stake is an algorithm to achieve distributed consensus within blockchain networks.\nProof is Stake is intended to replace Proof of work since a significant chunk of people believe that recursive hashing is largely unproductive and unnecessary.\nUnlike bitcoin where anyone can mine irrespectively, Proof of Stake is structured to prioritize certain miners over other miners.\nThis prioritization can be based on their ownership of ether in the network, however that would cause undesired centralization since the richest miner would then have an unfair permanent advantage in the mining process that happens within the network.\nThere have been various implementations of numerous proposed ideas such as NXT, Blackcoin, decred hybrid and peercoin. The major problem remains in gaining consensus over what technique or prioritization factor would be necessary in deciding which block variants to be implemented.\nAge, total percentage of tokens held in network and balance of address are among the considered factors for implementing proof of stake.\nThere have been a lot of speculation over Ethereum switching over from proof of work to proof of stake. Ethereum had previously suggested Slasher protocol before designing and implementing their own proof of work algorithm called Ethash.\nA proof stake protocol named casper is in experimentation and could probably succeed Ethash.\nProof of Burn:\nProof of burn is an intended alternate replacement for proof of stake and proof of work while achieving distributed consensus.\nProof of work is based on recursive hashing to find a nonce and its implied cost is mainly time, equipment and electricity used while hashing recursively.\nProof of burn’s significance is largely brought about by “burning tokens” in a unrecoverable manner such that it is easy to verify and extremely hard to undo.\n1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE -> 13.18813499BTC\nIt is highly unlikely that a private key exists or statistically be generated to that particular bitcoin address.\nProof of burn’s implicit cost is the token that are considered unspendable. Proof of work and Proof of burn both have their implied costs where proof of burn’s liability is mainly limited to the value of tokens to be rendered “burnt”.\nIn fact, Bitcoin’s first block reward to this address is also unspendable or considered burnt..\nProof of burn has been used to add value to many altcoins and cryptocurrencies alike under the belief that burning a particularly valuable token to add the burnt token’s implicit value to a new token that’s to be generated.\nThis can be viewed in a similar manner to hedging.\nA parent token that’s burnt is hedged and new tokens are released upon the burnt/hedged tokens to be used for other reasons.\nSome view burning tokens as a transfer of intrinsic work done to obtain tokens based on the burnt tokens.\nFor example,on average if it takes 48,800 kw hrs to mine one bitcoin, by burning 10 bitcoins(488,000 kw hrs) and releasing a 488,000 tokens called say, tincoin; each tincoin would considered equivalent result of 1 kw hr of work done.\nIt all boils down to relative value transfer.']	['<urn:uuid:2c116ab0-70ad-4988-8085-dd40cec8dc6a>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	10	61	1187
38	what types of vegetation ecosystems exist in ngorongoro conservation area at different altitudes and landforms	The Ngorongoro Conservation Area contains several overlapping ecosystems and distinct habitats due to variations in climate, landforms and altitude. The steep slopes feature scrub heath, montane long grasslands, high open moorland and remnants of dense evergreen montane forests. The highland areas contain trees like peacock flower, yellowwood, Hagenia abyssinica and sweet olive. There's a large bamboo stand on Oldeani Mountain and pencil cedar on Makarut Mountain. Lower slopes are dominated by Croton species, while upland woodlands feature red thorn and gum acacia. The crater floor consists mainly of open shortgrass plains with lakes and marshes, plus two Acacia woodland patches. The western plains are grass-covered with occasional umbrella acacia and Commiphora africana trees, while drier areas near Lake Eyasi are dominated by blackthorn and zebrawood.	"['Ngorongoro National Park\n""the largest unbroken and un-flooded caldera in the world""\nEncompassing three spectacular volcanic craters, the Olduvai Gorge, huge expanses of savannah, forest and bush land, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area is the flagship of Tanzania\'s tourism industry. The Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA), measuring 8,300 square kilometers, is also the only place on earth where mankind and wild animals coexist in harmony. The NCA became a Man and Biosphere Reserve in 1971 and was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. Originally part of the Serengeti National Park when the latter was established by the British in 1951, in 1959 the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA) was formed, separating NCA from Serengeti. Land within the area is multi-use, providing protection status for wildlife while also permitting human habitation. Its uniqueness lays in the fact that the NCA is where man, livestock and wild animals live in peace: Maasai cattle can sometimes be seen grazing alongside zebras on Ngorongoro\'s grassland.\nHad it not become the world\'s sixth-largest unbroken caldera, then what is now known as the Ngorongoro crater could have been a towering volcanic mountain, as high as Kilimanjaro.\nThe crater is the flagship tourism feature for the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. It is a large, unbroken, un-flooded caldera, formed when a giant volcano exploded and collapsed some three million years ago. The Ngorongoro crater sinks to a depth of 610 metres, with a base area covering 260 square kilometers. The height of the original volcano must have ranged between 4,500 to 5,800 metres high. Apart from the main caldera, Ngorongoro also has two other volcanic craters: Olmoti and Empakai, the former famous for its stunning waterfalls, and the latter holding a deep lake and lush, green walls.\nOn the leeward of the Ngorongoro highlands protrudes the iconic Oldonyo Lengai, an active volcano and Tanzania\'s third highest peak after Kilimanjaro and Meru . Known to local people as the Mountain of God, Mount Lengai\'s last major eruption occurred in 2007. At the mountain\'s foot is Lake Natron, East Africa\'s major breeding ground for flamingos.\nThe name Ngorongoro is derived from llkorongoro, a Maasai word given to the age group of Maasai warriors who defeated the previous occupants of the area, known as the Datong around the 1800s. The Datong had in turn taken them from their predecessors the Hadzabe (bushmen/hunter-gatherers). The name Ilkorongoro echoed sounds of the bells \'koh-rohng-roh\' that the Maasai wore during the battle, and it is from this that the name Ngorongoro comes from. Furthermore the Maasai have also given names to the walls known as \'entiak\' which defines as sheer drop, and the floor as \'ramat\' meaning heath-land of the crater.\nFlora and Fauna\nA population of about 25,000 large animals, largely ungulates along with the highest density of mammalian predators in Africa, lives in the crater. These include black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis (CR), which have declined from about 108 in 1964-66 to between 11-14 in 1995, and hippopotamus Hippopotamus amphibius which are very uncommon in the area. There are also many other ungulates: wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus (7,000 estimated in 1994), zebraEquus burchelli (4,000), eland Taurotragus oryx, Grant\'s and Thomson\'s gazelles Gazella granti and G. thomsoni (3,000). The crater has the densest known population of lion Panthera leo (VU) numbering 62 in 2001. On the crater rim are leopard Panthera pardus, elephantLoxodonta africana (EN) numbering 42 in 1987 but only 29 in 1992, mountain reedbuckRedunca fulvorufula and buffalo Syncerus caffer (4,000 in 1994). However, since the 1980s the crater\'s wildebeest population has fallen by a quarter to about 19,000 and the numbers of eland and Thomson\'s gazelle have also declined while buffaloes increased greatly, probably due to the long prevention of fire which favors high fibrous grasses over shorter less fibrous types.\nIn summer enormous numbers of Serengeti migrants pass through the plains of the reserve, including 1.7 million wildebeest, 260,00 zebra and 470,000 gazelles. Waterbuck Kobus ellipsiprymnus mainly occur mainly near Lerai Forest; serval Felis serval occur widely in the crater and on the plains to the west. Common in the reserve are lion, hartebeest Alcelaphus buselaphus, spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta and jackal Canis aureus. Cheetah Acinonyx jubatus (VU), though common in the reserve, are scarce in the crater itself. Wild dog Lycaon pictus (EN) has recently disappeared from the crater and may have declined elsewhere in the Conservation Area as well. Golden cat Felis aurata has recently been seen in the Ngorongoro forest.\nOver 500 species of bird have been recorded within the NCA. These include ostrich Struthio camelus, with white pelican Pelicanus onocrotalus, and greater and lesser flamingo Phoenicopterus ruber and P.minor on Lake Makat in Ngorongoro crater, Lake Ndutu and the Empakaai crater lake where over a million birds forgather. There are also lammergeier Gypaetus barbatus, Ruepell\'s griffon, Gyps ruepelli (110) Verreaux\'s eagle Aquila verreauxii, Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus, pallid harrier Circus macrourus, lesser falcon Falco naumanni (VU), Taita falcon F. fasciinucha, kori bustard Choriotis kori, Fischer\'s lovebird Agapornis fischeri, rosy-breasted longclaw Macronyx ameliae, Karamoja apalis Apalis karamojae (VU), redthroated tit Parus fringillinus and Jackson\'s whydah Euplectes jacksoni. Sunbirds in the highland forest include the golden winged sunbird Nectarinia reichenowi and eastern double collared sunbird N. mediocris. Other waterbirds found on Lake Eyasi include yellowbilled stork Mycteria ibis, African spoonbillPlatalea alba, avocet Recurvirostra avosetta and greyheaded gull Larus cirrocephalus. The butterfly Papilio sjoestedti, sometimes known as the Kilimanjaro swallowtail, flies in the montane forests. It has a very restricted range but is well protected in national parks.\nThe variations in climate, landforms and altitude have resulted in several overlapping ecosystems and distinct habitats. WithinTanzania the area is important for retaining uncultivated lowland vegetation, for the arid and semi-arid plant communities below 1,300 m, for its abundant shortgrass grazing and for the water catchment highland forests. Scrub heath, montane long grasslands, high open moorland and the remains of dense evergreen montane forests cover the steep slopes. Highland trees include peacock flower Albizzia gummifera, yellowwood Podocarpus latifolia, Hagenia abyssinica and sweet olive Olea chrysophylla. There is an extensive stand of pure bamboo Arundinaria alpina on Oldeani Mountain and pencil cedar Juniperus procera on Makarut Mountain in the west.Croton spp. dominate lower slopes. The upland woodlands containing red thorn Acacia lahai and gum acacia A. seyal are critical for protecting the watershed.\nThe crater floor is mainly open shortgrass plains with fresh and brackish water lakes, marshes, swamps and two patches of Acacia woodland: Lerai Forest, with codominants yellow fever tree Acacia xanthophloea and Rauvolfia caffra; and Laiyanai Forest with pillar wood Cassipourea malosana, Albizzia gummifera, and Acacia lahai. The undulating plains to the west are grass-covered with occasional umbrella acacia Acacia tortilis and Commiphora africana trees, which become almost desert during periods of severe drought. Blackthorn Acacia mellifera and zebrawood Dalbergia melanoxylon dominate in the drier conditions beside Lake Eyasi.

39	hi im new to military history what were german mines like in ww2 and how was the 88mm gun used in combat	German mines in WW2 included several types like the Riegel mine 43/44, which contained 17.8 pounds of TNT and could severely damage tank suspensions or penetrate thin belly armor. The Topfmine series, made from wood pulp and cardboard, was developed in 1944 to avoid detection. The Tellermine series evolved throughout the war, with models from 29 to 43, typically carrying 12-13 pound charges. As for the 88mm gun, it began as an anti-aircraft weapon but proved extremely effective against ground targets during the Spanish Civil War. In North Africa, it could penetrate 90mm of armor at 2000 meters, making it lethal against Allied tanks. At Halfaya, it could penetrate 80mm of armor from over 2200 meters. During Operation Goodwood in 1944, 88mm guns were instrumental in destroying at least 220 British tanks near Caen. The gun was also highly effective in its original anti-aircraft role, contributing to shooting down 3501 American planes in 1944 alone.	['Let’s Talk About The Other Things That Killed Shermans, Mines and AT guns, The True Hidden Menace.\nMines, What can we say about mines, no one likes them, but they still do a job that has to be done. We only going to cover anti-tank mines, since Anti-personnel mines do not harm tanks.\nThe Riegel mine 43/44.\nThis mine was steel cased, anti-tank mine that looked like a long rectangular box. It had 17.8 pounds of TNT explosive in it. That’s enough BOOM to really mess up a tank’s suspension. A really unlucky Sherman might have this go off right under the tank’s rear belly, where the armor was thinnest, and blow into the engine compartment and really knock the tank out. In most cases, this mine would do enough damage the tank would need battalion level repair if that tank wasn’t written off for a total rebuild.\nProduction on these things started in 43, and by the end of the war, they had produced over 3 million of them. Apparently, there is no safe way to disable this mine, and the recommended way of removing it is to just blow it up. There is no telling how many of these took out Shermans, but it was probably a large percentage of the Mine losses in 44/45.\nThe Topfmine A, B, and C.\nThese mines went into service in 1944. They were made from wood pulp and cardboard, with tar for waterproofing. They had a bigger charge but the metal cased mines probably worked better. These mines went into production for two reasons, they were harder for mine detectors to detect, and the case was cheap and easy to produce and used no steel. The 13-pound charge would do a lot of suspension damage.\nThe Tellermine 29:\nThis mine was developed in the early 30s and was mostly used in training but saw limited use in Normandy. 13-pound charge meant it would be effective, but its age made it primitive.\nThe Tellermine 35:\nThis mine was used for the entire war and could even be used underwater. Steel cased like the older model, this one went into production in 35. This mine had a slightly smaller 12-pound charge. Most of the time this mine would just blow a track off, and damage the suspension, but it could get lucky and do more damage.\nThe Tellermine 42:\nThis mine was an improvement on the 35 and used the same charge. It had improved anti-handling devices. This would be a very common mine through the end of the war. It went into production in 42 and was quickly superseded by the 43 models.\nThe Tellermine 43:\nImage courtesy of the LoneSentry\nA further improvement on the 42 models, cheaper to produce, with the same charge, this mine went into production, you guessed it, in 1943.\nH-S mine 4672:\nThis shaped charge mine went into production in late 44 and was used to the end of the war. It basically was a panzerfaust head used as a mine. The mine shot the head out of the ground hoping for a belly hit. This mine would be bad news for wet ammo rack Shermans. Only 59,000 were made, making it rare. This mine was very effective even with its small 3-pound charge. The Germans felt the heads were better-used don Panzerfausts, explaining the limited production.\nPanzer Stab 43:\nThis mine was very much like the 4672 mines but didn’t launch the projectile. This mine was even rarer and was discontinued, probably because it worked, by the Germans the same year it went into production. Around 25k got made before they killed it.\nThat’s a lot of mines and that’s just the mines the Germans made, I’m sure they used any stocks of captured mines they got their thieving paws on. So I’ll add Russian, British, and US AT mines here soon too. Mines always accounted for 10 to 30% of tank losses depending on the year, month, and theater you look at the losses in. There are a few pictures of Sherman tank catastrophically blown up, with the whole upper hull ripped away. They are labeled as mine damaged, and in a few cases, the labeling mentions two mines being put into the same hole, I think the ones labeled ‘mine damage’ probably lost the part about two mines in the hole to time. I suspect those photos of blown-up Shermans are cases of two or more mines in one hole or an even bigger explosive like a dud Arty shell, or aircraft bomb could be put in the hole too.\nTankers probably really hated mines, in many cases minefields would be covered by well-hidden AT gun positions or even tanks, and in this role, the Panther was a pretty good tank, since it didn’t need to move much. Hitting a mine in an ambush like that could be very deadly for the crew when they bailed out to look at the damage or retreat to the rear. The random leftover mine, or stumbling into a minefield not covered by AT guns would be a big inconvenience but rarely resulted in a fully destroyed tank or lost crew members.\nAT guns, cheap and easy to produce, these guns were a big threat to tanks but had little value to a mobile force.\nAT guns were just what they sound like, large, Anti-Tank guns, on towable mounts. Most were as small and low slung as possible. Unless it was a US 3 inch AT gun, then they are huge. Even guns normally not a huge threat to a Sherman like the PAK 38 50mm AT gun could punch through the Shermans side if it was hidden well enough for the Shermans to give them the shot. All the larger PAK guns had no trouble punching right through most Shermans. Guns set up in ambush would have pre-range cards, giving them an advantage in shooting and getting hits. They are much easier to hide than a tank and can even have bunkers built around them. Those are all reasons why these things made Sherman tanker’s lives harder.\nTowed AT guns have a lot of negatives. For one, they are towed, by trucks, or halftracks, they have to be limbered and unlimbered, or set up or packed up to go. This is very hard to do in a useful way if you’re attacking with a mechanized force. By the time the guns are set up, if done at safe distances, the battle has moved on. At guns only have a small lightly armored shield, the crews would have to rely on personal foxholes or larger trench works if they had time. The more time it had to get in place and camouflaged the position the better things would be for the gun and crew. But unless they had fortifications with overhead cover for the gun and crew, making it effectively a fixed gun, any kind of indirect fire weapon is going to make their lives hard. If the artillery fire wasn’t killing the crew, it would at least be keeping it from firing.\nAbout half of the US tank destroyer battalions used only towed anti-tank guns. The battalions were not very successful, even during German offensives like the Battle of the Bulge. Both tracked TD battalions and towed were quickly disbanded after WWII, and towed anti-tank guns would not be a big part of most western nation’s militaries after the war either. AT guns would prove very useful to the Germans from mid-war on after they were losing. They had a lot of these guns, and they accounted for a lot of tank kills. It was hard to determine in many cases what type of gun killed a tank, but tanks were much rarer than AT guns.\nThe Sherman 75mm tanks were actually better at dealing with AT guns than the later model tanks that had the 76mm gun since it had a smaller explosive charge. It was far from useless though. A tank’s best way of dealing with an AT gun was to shoot the hell out of it with all guns available once it was spotted, and sometimes if the crew was suppressed, they’d even get a dose of the tracks.\nPak 38 50mm AT Gun:\nThis little gun was the main German AT gun from 1941 until superseded by the Pak 40. It was still used until the end of the war. The Germans were so desperate they couldn’t afford to retire any weapons. Crewed by five men, it could be moved around pretty handily by the crew but required a light truck or some kind of tow vehicle to go any real distance. I won’t go into great detail about the gun but it needed to be very close to a Sherman to knock it out from the front, not so much from the sides. Nearly 10,000 produced.\nPak 40 75mm AT Gun:\nThis gun was larger; almost double the weight of the Pak 38. This gun could also take the Sherman out at the combat ranges they normally faced each other. The Germans made nearly 20,000 of these guns, so they are probably responsible for a lot of knocked out Shermans. In some cases, the same type of gun may have knocked the same Sherman out multiple times. This gun required a bigger truck or halftrack to haul, but overall, it was a great gun.\nPak 43 88mm AT Gun:\nThis ‘fearsome’ gun had the same PR people as the big cats, but at least, in this case, the gun performed well, though not to the mythical levels some would have you believe. No it can’t take out an M1 ‘Abrahams’, it could take out any allied tank it faced, but it was nearly as rare as the Tiger I&II. They only produced around 2000 of these guns, so they only outnumber the combined Tigers production number of 1839, by a small margin. Overkill for most of the combat it saw, it would have been more useful if the Allies had made the same mistake of wasting resources on heavy tanks, but since they didn’t, this gun was almost entirely a waste of time. The gun weighed almost 10,000 pounds, and it was an awkward, gun mount, even worse than the US 76 AT gun mount. It needed a very large tow vehicle and its size and weight limited where it could be employed.\nFlak 18/36/37 88mm dual-purpose AA/AT Guns.\nAnother ‘mythical’ German weapon, this one started life as a mediocre AA gun that was pressed into use as a direct fire weapon when needed. As a direct fire weapon, it was pretty good, these larger and much more powerful guns were better at penning armor than anything being mounted on a tank before or at the beginning of the war. Capable of destroying all the French and British tanks the Germans faced, this gun could even handle the T-34 and KV-1/2 tanks, and it was the only thing the Germans had in any real numbers that could. This led to it being mounted in the Tiger I. The Pak 43 was more powerful, but this gun was more numerous with over 20,000 being produced. If any allied troops were right when they thought an 88 was shooting at them it would be one of these.\nThere was a Flak 41 88mm, but it was a failed attempt to improve upon the 18/36/37 failings as an AA gun. The reason the basic 88 Flak gun failed as an AA gun was that it had optical range finding, and couldn’t lob a shell high enough to hit US heavy bombers, even the older models like the B-17. They also lacked radar ranging or laying, unlike the superior US M1/2/3 90mm AA gun system. Had these guns not found their nitch in the direct fire role they would have gone down in history as the mediocre AA guns they were.\nNext up, Panzerfausts, or AT-sticks as I now call them.\nSources: Armored Thunderbolt by Zaloga, Yeide’s The Tank Killers, The Infantries Armor, and Steel Victory, Sherman by Hunnicutt, Combat Lessons, The Rank and file, what they do and how they are doing it 1-7, and 9 WWII Armor, Ballistics and Gunnery by Bird and Livingston, TM4 Sherman tank at war by Green, Tanks are a Might Fine Thing by Stout, the Lone Sentry, TM9-1940 Land mines, TME9-369A German 88MM AA Gun, TME30-451 Handbook on German Armed Forces 1945, DOA Army Battle Casualties and Non-Battle Deaths in WWII, FKSM 17-3-2 Armor in Battle, Another River, another town by Irwin, Wargaming’s Operation Think Tank Videos .', 'The early development\nAfter the First World War it was by the Treaty of Versailles that\nit was conducted that Germany was no longer allowed to manufacture weapons in their own\ncountry. To surpass this rule, Krupp sent some technicians to Bofors in Sweden, between 1920 and 1930.\nWhen Hitler came to power in 1933, the technicians from Krupp returned to their homeland with\nthe design of a 8.8cm (or 88mm) anti-aircraft gun. The most distinctive feature on the weapon was the barrel.\nThis was constructed of several segments so damaged pieces would be easy to replace. Another plus\nwas that there was no special machinery necessary, and they could be produced in substantial numbers.\nDirectionequipment on an 8.8cm Flak 37\nAfter a few changes, the first production cannon was named the 8.8cm Flak 36. ‘Flak’\nstood for FlugzeugAbwehrKanone. More improvements led to the model 37. The best way to spot\nwhich Falk is Which of the two models is to look at the directionequipment, which are placed in boxes on\na Flak 37, and were round on the Flak 36.\nDirectionequipment on an 8.8cm Flak 37\nA well trained crew could shoot 15 shells of 9 kilo each to a height of\n12 km within one minute. Until the end of the war, the Flak 36/37 and the Flak 18\nvariant were the basis of the German anti-aircraft units.\nIn 1935, during the Spanish Civil War, the German Luftwaffe brought\nthe Kondorlegion to Spain to gain experience with the new equipment and to test\nnew tactics in the support of Franco. In Spain an 8.8cm Flak 18 with a smoother\nbarrel was used. Here was discovered that it was not only a great anti-aircraft gun,\nbut also a superb cannon for targets at ground level. It had a devastating effect on\ntargets and moral, the last on both sides. In Germany a special direction finder and\nanti-tank ammunition was developed for the 8.8cm. But this sidestep was only for extra\nsupport when needed, because the standard anti-tank cannon, the 50mm PaK 38 was manufactured in plenty of numbers.\nA 50mm PaK\n38, the standard anti-tank cannon\nEarly in the Second World War, the PaK (Panzerabwehrkanone) 38 with armoured piercing\nshells had a penetration ability of 96 mm at a 1000 meters, enough for every British\ntank at that time.\nBut the 8.8cm proved itself in the west during the blitzkrieg of Europe. During a desperate\nattempt to break out of their predicament, 74 British tanks tried to escape on May 21,\n1940 near Arras. The German 35mm was the only anti-tank gun around and was not sufficient\nenough. But with the assistance of 105mm artillery and 8.8cm’s the British were stopped.\nNot only vehicles were the targets for the 88’s, also stationary targets, like bunkers\nand casemats were shot at. From relative short distances some fortresses of the Maginot\nLine were fired upon with devastating effect.\nAn 8.8cm Flak\n18 fires at the Maginot Line\nDuring the war in the desert in 1941, the anti-tank guns were scattered\nover great distances. To overcome the empty spaces between these guns, the Lufwaffe had 24\n88’s Flak guns for the army to use. Because of their high profile, it had a two meter\nhigh protective plate, the gun was a prominent target. To protect the gun it was necessary\nto dig it in behind an earth wall.\nAn 8.8cm in\naction in North-Africa\nThe first shots in anger on ground targets in North-Africa came during the\ndefense of Halfaya. A British tank, with armour of 80 mm in 1941, was an easy target for over\n2200 meters, even under an angle 30°. At 2000 meter it could penetrate 90 mm. Over a distance of\n1100 meters, the 8.8cm could handle 108 mm of steel, detonate a small charge that brought death\nto any tank and it’s crew.\nA Flak 37 has a plane in sight\n(notice the rings on the barrel, one for every downed aircraft)\nBecause at one time there were enough 8.8cm’s 8.8cm anti-aircraft guns with the Luftwaffe,\nspare ones were lent for anti-tank duties. In the field the anti-aircraft equipment was taken of, and the\nguns adapted for ground targets.\nThe success of the anti-tank roll of the 88’s, the Africa Corps was equiped with extra guns. During the\nbattle of Alamein, the ‘Korps’ had 86 guns to use against the British troops.\nA Flak 37 is preserved at the\nOmaha Beach Museum, Vierville-sur-Mer\nWhen during the Russian campaign, the German troops came across the T-34 tank, a\nlot of the anti-tank guns proofed insufficient. Even the 50mm PAK 38 cannon was useless. Only ammo with\na core of wolfram could penetrate the Russian armour. Unfortunately for Germany, this material was hard\nto come by. So once more they went to Krupp to produce a 75mm gun, and a special 8.8cm for the anti-tank\nroll. This would lead to the PAK 43. An advantage with this cannon was it’s ability to fire when it was\non his wheels. For the 8.8cm Flak it was always necessary to placed it on it’s platform before it could\ngo into action. Also, the profile of the PAK 43 was brought down to a height of 1.50 meter.\nAn 8.8cm PAK\n43/41, Omaha Beach Museum\nThe taught behind the concept was to improve it’s action by extending the room for\na larger shell. But during production problems came to light that required to adapt the undercarriage.\nThe gun, the 8.8cm PAK 43/41 became struggle for the troops to handle in the Russian mud. But, nevertheless,\nthe PAK 43/41 was a excellent weapon with a penetration of 168 mm from a distance of 1100 meters under an angle\nof 30°. As far as 3300 meters, the gun had more effect the 8.8cm Flak op 1100 meters! Despite it’s clumsiness in\nthe field, it was a very deadly weapon from 160 to 3300 meters. It is known that at one time it killed six T-34\ntanks in Russia from as far as 3900 meters! The 23 kilo heavy shell had one nasty habit, after every shot a black\ncloud of smoke was produced that with calm weather obscured the view for the next shot, and gave the enemy the\nposition of the gun.\nDifferent sorts, only one size, 8.8cm\n(a Flak 18 outside the museum at Falaise)\nDuring the war, the 8.8cm PAK 43 cannon found it’s way in German tanks,\nlike the Jagdpanther. Was gun firstly developed as a weapon of defense in the anti-aircraft\nroll, in the tank it became a tactic fast moving attack weapon. But the Allies had the armour\non their tanks improved and also better anti-tank guns mounted like the British 17-pounder\nand the American 90mm. But the 8.8cm stayed to the end of the war a horror to the Allied crews\nin their tanks. During the battles around Caen the gun was terribly effective.

In the progress of\nthe war, the air defense became very accurate, thanks also to radar. In 1942, around 15.000 8.8cm\nguns were in the frontline of the German air defense. During 1944 3501 American planes fell victim\nto the anti aircraft fire. Another 600 were shot down by German fighters.

40	I love animals but I'm not sure which path to take - what's the main difference between the daily work of a large animal vet versus an animal care service worker?	Large animal veterinarians primarily focus on medical care - they diagnose and treat conditions, perform surgeries, manage medications, and provide preventive care for livestock and horses, often traveling to farms. Animal care service workers, on the other hand, focus on basic daily care in facilities like zoos, kennels, and shelters, performing physically demanding work caring for animals' basic needs. Their work can be emotionally demanding when animals get sick or die, but doesn't involve medical procedures like a vet would perform.	['Being a veterinarian can be fun and exciting, but it’s also a lot of hard work. Large-animal veterinarians spend their days treating everything from cattle and horses to pigs, sheep, and goats. These vets spend much of their time examining and vaccinating livestock on ranches and farms. They may also treat minor ailments and perform surgeries as needed.\nLARGE ANIMAL VETERINARIANS: WHAT DO THEY DO?\nThe daily tasks of large animal veterinarians vary widely depending on their specific specialty. For example, a large animal anaesthesiologist may handle large animals’ anaesthesia and pain management needs. They may also need to be proficient in veterinary terminology and to understand and treat the diseases specific to each large animal species. Specialists may focus on equine, exotic, exotic orthopedic, or large animal medicine.\nQUALIFICATIONS FOR A LARGE ANIMAL VETERINARIAN\nThe first step toward becoming a large animal veterinarian is earning a bachelor’s degree. The degree may be in a field like equine or large animal science, depending on their chosen specialty. The vet must then earn a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree. To become licensed veterinarians, large animal vets may also need to pass the North American Veterinary Licensing Examination (NAVLE) exam.\nAfter earning a degree, large animal vets often must pass the required state licensing exams. Some states have unique licensing requirements for large animal veterinarians, depending on the type of practice they plan to operate.\nWHEN TO CALL A LARGE ANIMAL VET\nWhen a large animal shows signs of sickness, it’s a good idea to consult a vet who has experience treating the specific species. Livestock and other large animal often experience different health challenges than companion animals such as cats and dogs. For example, cows often suffer from laminitis. This disorder is where excess plantar pressure, caused by a combination of high pre-existing inflammation, poor hoof structure, and excess cartilage, destroys the tissues between the heel and the coffin joint. A large animal veterinarian would have the training and experience to identify and treat laminitis and other diseases common in livestock.\nUNIQUE HEALTH CONDITIONS THEY MAY TREAT\nLarge animal vets may be called upon to treat various health conditions in the animals they care for. Some common conditions treated in large animals include:\n- Arthritis-causing joint diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and laminitis\n- Medical conditions that affect the reproductive system, such as uroliths in horses and polycystic ovarian syndrome in cattle\n- Autoimmune diseases, such as equine metritis and equine pemphigus\n- Skin disorders, such as bacterial folliculitis, interdigital dermatitis, and sebaceous adenitis\nTHE DAILY ACTIVITIES OF LARGE ANIMAL VETERINARIANS\nThe day-to-day tasks of a large animal veterinarian can vary widely. Depending on the needs of their patients, a large animal vet may spend their time providing preventive care, diagnosing health conditions, administering treatment, or performing surgery. Given the size of the animals they care for, many large animal vets travel to homes and farms to provide care. A large animal vet’s daily routine may include:\n- Diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions in large animals, such as arthritis, lameness, and colic in cattle and horses\n- Minor surgery, such as spaying or neutering male animals, removing splints and bandages from injured animals, and minor dental work, such as cleaning and polishing teeth\n- Examining and cleaning large animals, such as horses, cows, sheep, and pigs\n- Managing medications\n- Preventive care, such as ensuring vaccinations are kept current and worming or deworming protocols are followed\n- Preventive health care, such as annual physical exams and dental cleanings\nTHE VALUE OF A TRUSTED LARGE ANIMAL VETERINARIAN\nWhether you are a farmer or rancher with herds of livestock or you own and ride a horse for pleasure, you depend on your vet to keep your animals healthy and in good shape. Knowing you can trust a large animal vet to handle everything from emergencies to routine care gives you peace of mind. Make sure you establish a relationship with your local large animal vet so that you can partner with them to promote a better future for your animals and you.', 'You don’t need to spend four to eight years or more in school so you can work with animals. Instead, you might want to consider a trade program that gives you practical information you’ll be able to use almost immediately.\nYou’ll learn how to interact with others who are either in or planning to enter animal science. You’ll learn how to think critically. You’ll be able to work on coursework that will keep you interested. In the classroom, you’ll be interacting with your instructor and fellow students and working on in-depth research and analysis of animal science issues.\nWhat kinds of careers can you move into? You might consider becoming a zookeeper, animal scientist, or even a breeding technician. You could work as a livestock auctioneer or manager, become a farmer and work with animals on someone’s farm or your own farm with a focus on agricultural science, or you might wish to become an educator in the field.\nOr, if you have plans to go to college for a few more years, becoming an animal geneticist may be a good option. If you decide to really devote some time to your education, you could still go on to become a veterinarian.\nWhat Do Workers in Animal Science Do?\nOnce you complete your trade or training program, your career options are wide open. Depending on where your interests lie, you could end up in a variety of fields.\nYou may choose science and technology, where you’ll work on various areas. These include nutrition/health/disease control, animal behavior, training and care taking, research, genetics and animal breeding, or other specializations.\nOr your interest may lie in veterinary medicine. With an animal sciences degree, you can focus on becoming a veterinary technician. While veterinarians must earn a bachelor’s and master’s degree in pre-veterinary and veterinary medicine. As a veterinary tech, you’ll be able to get into the field with much less lead time and, once you get some experience, your options will grow even more. Do you want to work with large animals or small? Work in public health for animals? Do you want to focus on food safety, do research, inspections, or preventive medicine?\nIf you go into food safety, research, public health, or inspections, you could find work with local, state, or federal government agencies. These include the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services.\nWhere Do Animal Science School Graduates Work?\n- Conservation Officer:\nIn this position, you’ll work out in the wild to protect animals. By doing this, you also protect the environment as the two are inextricably linked. As a conservation officer, you’ll help to protect and improve areas that are environmentally important, which allows animals large and small to thrive.\n- Food Industry:\nChoosing to work in the food industry may mean earning secondary degrees after you complete your degree in animal sciences, but that all depends on your interest in moving up in the field. You may help identify and research animal health in this arena and make sure that farms are run with public health in mind. This work helps to improve the health and wellness of consumers and ensure compliance with local and federal rules. With your animal sciences background, you’ll able to offer more value in this field.\n- Veterinary Technician:\nHere, you’ll earn a degree that will allow you to assist full veterinarians. You may take courses that focus on animal anatomy, physiology, biology, zoology, chemistry, or microbiology. The human parents of pets you see will be grateful for your expertise when the time comes for them to visit the vet.\nWhy Become an Animal Science Graduate?\nAs a student of animal science, you’ll focus on how the body systems of animals (captive and domestic) function. You’ll also learn how these creatures are utilized by people, such as livestock. Your education focuses on the most humane and modern way to take care of the animals we live with.\nYou may decide to continue your education so you can move on into animal husbandry or you may decide you want to wait to go back to school - you may find work in animal shelters, taking care of lost pets or animals that have been surrendered by their owners.\nCompleting either a training or trade program in animal science gives you a good foundation for earning a bachelor’s and master’s in animal science. Whether you decide to go into animal dentistry or focus more on laboratory animal science, your education and internships will give you an invaluable background no matter where you end up.\nHow to Become an Animal Services Worker\nGED or High School Diploma\nIf you know early on that you’re interested in working with animals, you’ll want to fill your high school class schedule as much as possible with sciences, math classes, computer science, English, environmental earth science, calculus, trigonometry, and statistics. If you plan to keep going to school beyond your animal science trade school, this will help you to get into universities more easily.\nDepending on where you are hoping to earn your trade or vocational education, you may only need a high school diploma or GED to attend. However, some schools are slightly more exclusive and require that you have maintained a certain GPA in high school or that you take and pass the ACT or SAT standardized tests. These programs will have their own requirements in terms of what constitutes a passing score, so you should find 1-3 programs you are interested in attending and find their requirements as soon as possible.\nAnimal Science Training and Other Certification\n- Zoo & Aquarium Science:\nIf you plan to become an aquarist or zookeeper, this certificate will fit perfectly into your career plans. You’ll be able to begin working with primates, marine mammals, carnivores, and other exotic wildlife.\n- Animal Care, Equine, and Land Based:\nBy opting for a course that covers animal care, equine, and land-based industries, you’ll be able to apply for hundreds of opportunities. You may plan to work as a park ranger or in a veterinary practice in the country.\n- Equine Science:\nThese professional development programs offer you both instruction and practical experience in the nutrition, management, physiology, and care of horses.\n- Animal Assisted Therapy:\nEarning this certificate means you’ll be able to share your love of animals with others and show them how the relationships between humans and animals can enrich their lives. It can also help those who need interactions with animals who won’t judge. This certificate teaches you about animal-assisted therapy, education, and activities.\n- HNC Animal Management:\nThis Higher National Certificate gives you a good basis for working with animals. You’ll be prepared for employment in a supervisory-level position if you earn this along with your animal sciences degree.\n- Animal Science Fundamentals:\nIn this type of certificate program, you’ll learn basic knowledge in the fundamentals of animal science. This may allow you to obtain entry-level employment in agricultural sales and services, on ranges, and on farms. This is one of the first steps toward a career as an educator in agricultural science as well.\n- Animal Care & Management:\nEarning this certificate means you’ll be able to enter a career path in the veterinary care of domesticated animals (pets). You’ll spend time interning at veterinary clinics or animal hospitals. A part of your internship prepares you to work in a vet clinic, using and caring for the instruments, learning how to sterilize them, and how to analyze both blood and urine samples.\nBecause you may have additional career plans, such as working as an animal behaviorist or a veterinarian, you need to give yourself more pathways toward that goal. This means returning to school to earn a full four-year degree if you haven’t and then earning higher degrees (master’s, doctorate in veterinary medicine).\nA good option is to earn a bachelor’s degree that will allow you to work with domestic animals, such as cats and dogs. Animals farmed as food sources are also domestic animals: turkeys, cows, pigs, and sheep. Draft animals also fall into this category: camels, horses, and donkeys – though you’re unlikely to deal with many camels in the U.S. unless you work at a petting zoo.\nYou may also consider earning a certificate in applied animal behavior. This program helps you to learn and understand the behaviors that some animals display so you can care for them and help to improve their quality of life and even their health. Consider cats - we know they hide when they are hurt or feeling sick. This is an instinctive behavior that helps them to protect themselves from predators and may help you explain to a worried pet owner why they might be acting strange and what they can do to help their pet.\nSalary and Job Outlook\nIf you decide to begin your career as a pet groomer, your median annual salary may sit around $20,000 in your early career. This position has an average mid-career salary of $33,000 and a late-career salary of $62,000.\nA veterinary technician’s early-career salary begins at around $25,000. Their mid-career salary average’s $35,000 and their late-career salary is closer to $51,000.\nDog trainers earn $25,000 in their early careers. Their mid-career salaries are $39,000 and their late-career salaries average closer to $101,000. If you enjoy working and spending a lot of time with dogs, this may be a position for you to consider. Dog walkers also often work in the grooming business and offer multiple services at one location.\nAnimal Care and Service workers earn $25,000 annually ($12.02/hour). If you are interested in this type of position, you can expect to receive on-the-job training once you’re hired. You’re likely to work in one of a variety of places where animals are housed or cared for such as zoos, kennels, veterinary clinics, animal shelters, stables, pet stores, and aquariums.\nYou must be ready to work hard physically. The work an animal care service worker does can be demanding. And, if you get attached to one or more of the animals, you may find the work can be emotionally demanding, especially if they get sick, go into an adoptive placement, or die. This job role was projected to grow by 22% between 2019 and 2029, which is much faster than average.\nAnimal Trainers work with and train various breeds of animals. The work they do may teach horses how to accept a harness and carry riders. Or you may train animals for obedience, security, and performance. This position holds a mean annual wage of $36,000, but that may be higher if you work with large aquatic animals (dolphins or orcas) or if you find yourself working on movie sets with trained animals.\nAs a veterinary technologist or technician, your median pay can be expected to be around $35,000. You may work in an animal hospital or private clinic, running medical tests so the vet can get a diagnosis for injuries and illnesses. As a technologist, you need a four-year degree, but technicians only need a two-year degree.\nWhile you are still in high school, you should make sure you take and understand your chemistry and biology courses. Physics will also help you out, especially if you think you might advance to a graduate degree.\nIf you take and do well in these classes while you are still a high school student, you’ll likely do well when they appear at a higher level in a trade or training program. Your instructors will be happy to see that you know more than the basics of all three sciences.\nVocational training may also help you to determine just what kind of work you want to do with animals. By completing this level of education, you’ll develop your knowledge of the various fields available and may even get a chance to intern in whichever field you think holds the most interest for you. Maybe you’ll have the chance to work at a farm and decide that this is the career you’ve always wanted, or perhaps you’ll decide that, while you like farm animals, it may really be worth it to complete a higher level of education and become a farm vet.\nAlong with working with animals, you have to be ready and willing to spend time working with a variety of other people. You need to be able to communicate with them effectively and efficiently, even when in the midst of an emergency. When working with animals, whether on a farm or in a vet’s office, you also need to communicate and express empathy to the owners of the animals you’ll be working with. This makes communication one of the top skills you must have.\nListen more than you speak—your clients will have important things about their pets to tell you. You’ll discuss with the vet what they told you and what it might mean in terms of a diagnosis, so you should be accurate. You’ll also take phone calls, give animal care information, and schedule appointments.\n- Work independently:\nYou shouldn’t need supervision to do most of your job. You must be willing to work independently when you are caring for an animal, whether that is during a short visit or when animals are kept overnight for observation and care.\n- Time management:\nStaying “on time” during a hectic day is incredibly important in a business where people expect to be seen on a schedule. If all of your tasks are equally important, you’ll need to be able to work with the entire veterinary team and get things done by helping each other and staying on task yourself.\nIt’s important when you work as intake for your animal patients that you be able to observe the animal and their owner, gather information from what you see as well as what you’re told, and be able to note anything important in a chart or share it with the vet.\n- Technical skills:\nYou’ll need to be comfortable with lab equipment and technical machinery used by a practice – you might be helping with urinalysis, disinfection, blood work, and sterilization of surgical instruments.\nYou’ll need to write effectively and efficiently so your veterinarian and other staff members know what you are saying.\nIf you want to do work with animals at a higher level, then earning a four-year bachelor’s degree allows you to work as either a zoologist or wildlife biologist; or you can earn a master’s degree and work as a veterinarian.\nAnother alternative to animal science is working as a veterinary assistant or laboratory animal caretaker. The median annual salary for these positions is $29,000. You’ll need a high school diploma or GED to work in this field and you’ll have on-the-job training. Your days will consist of routine animal care and you’ll likely also help the veterinarians and others with their daily work.\nIf you grew up on a farm and the work is familiar to you, you may only need a high school diploma or GED and five years of work experience in a similar occupation to find a position as an agriculture worker. You could help care for livestock and work with the products they produce. On-the-job training is sufficient for this position. You don’t necessarily need a high school diploma but it can help. The median annual pay for this position is $26,000.\nVocational Trade School & Career Paths']	['<urn:uuid:0101a0d4-0d7a-40ef-9ef1-6fd4d8ab334e>', '<urn:uuid:e2619861-42b7-459d-b488-66a8042a2367>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	31	81	3254
41	What are the differences between traditional ocean drift studies and modern pollution concerns, and how do these connect to marine ecosystem impacts?	Traditional ocean drift studies use drift cards to track currents and potential movement of spills, debris and sewage, providing valuable data through volunteer reporting of found cards. However, modern pollution concerns focus on more insidious threats - floating materials like plastic resin pellets (2-5mm in size) not only physically harm marine life through ingestion, but also concentrate Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) from seawater. These POPs then disrupt hormonal functioning of organisms, affecting growth, development and reproduction throughout the marine food chain.	"['Over the years, NOAA\'s Office of Response and Restoration (OR&R) and other NOAA offices have used drift cards--originally plastic but now thin, biodegradable pieces of wood, colored with bright non-toxic paint--to learn more about the direction of ocean currents in a particular region. On the cards are instructions asking the finder to report the date and location found.\nDrift cards are often released as part of an oil spill response exercise or drill. Our goal in releasing the cards is to gather information about the possible drift of an oil spill. Drift cards can also indicate where other things, such as stricken fishing boats, marine debris, plankton, or even sewage, might drift.\nDrift card studies have a number of benefits to us. They are inexpensive, allow us to do a small study over a broad range of environmental conditions and over a fairly long period of time, and give us the advantage of volunteer assistants!\nOn a few occasions in the past, we have released drift cards as part of an actual spill response. For example, the predecessor to OR&R released drift cards during the response to the December 1976 grounding of the M/V Argo Merchant near Nantucket Island, Mass. Released from Nantucket Shoals, several of these drift cards have been found over the years in Ireland and France. Drift cards were also released as part of the response to the June 1979 Ixtoc 1 oil well blowout in the Bay of Campache, 600 miles south of Texas in the Gulf of Mexico. These cards were released between July and August, 1979.\nFrom 2002 to 2004, OR&R scientists conducted an exploratory study to learn more about the direction of ocean currents off Oahu, Hawaii. The purpose of the study was twofold: to find a trend in where floating pollutants might go under different environmental conditions, if released from the south shores of Oahu, and to give us an idea of where we should direct our efforts in future studies.\nAbout once a month, volunteers from the oil spill cooperative, Clean Islands Council, released a batch of 100 cards from Barber\'s Point, near Honolulu. We also released several sets of special cards during Kona wind events. These events, with winds from the south and southwest, usually occur several times during the winter months in Hawaii and have the potential to carry pollutants to the Waikiki and Diamond Head areas.\nSafe Sanctuaries (Florida)\nIn 2005, a drift card release was one component of the pollution response drill, Safe Sanctuaries 2005 [PDF, 283 KB]. We designed the study to model floating pollutants in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, where the drill took place. In this exercise, OR&R and its co-lead, the National Marine Sanctuary Program, worked closely with partners in NOAA, the U.S. Coast Guard, and Florida State Department of Environmental Protection to exercise their emergency response capabilities and to provide training. (You can learn more about this event in the video, Safe Sanctuaries 2005: Emergency Response Drill. Drift cards are discussed at about 10:30.)\nSafe Seas (California)\nThe following year during the Safe Seas 2006 oil spill–preparedness exercise, we simulated spilled pollutants by releasing hundreds of drift cards at the site of hypothetical spills west of San Francisco. The results of this study are available on an earlier, archived version of our website. Our drift card FAQ answers many of the questions that people have asked about drift card releases, and the U.S. Geological Survey has more information and photos from the drill.\nMore Information about Drift Card and Ocean Studies\nThe Threat of Humboldt County’s Spartina Population to Other West Coast Estuaries [PDF, 1.4 MB]: A Portland State University research team used drift card releases from Washington state and California bays to help model the potential spread of an invasive marsh grass, Spartina, to Oregon estuaries. More information is available in the Spartina Dispersal Study: Drift Card Release FAQ [PDF, 87 KB].\nUsing Oceanographic Linkages to Guide Marine Protected Area Network Design [PDF, 489 KB]: Scientists have used drift cards to infer the movement of larvae of various marine species in the waters off northwestern Washington state to aid in planning networks of Marine Protected Areas.\nFlotsametrics and the Floating World: Retired oceanographer Curt Ebbesmeyer operates the Beachcombers Alert, an international network of beachcombers who gather and interpret traceable flotsam (floating trash). For some NOAA drifter releases that are no longer funded, NOAA has entrusted Dr. Ebbesmeyer as keeper of the drift card records. He can be reached through the Contact section of the Flotsametrics site.\nVideo: Adopt a Drifter: Scientists can also collect and analyze ocean data by using larger, more sophisticated drifting buoys. Through the NOAA Adopt a Drifter program, kids help deploy ""drifters"" from ships at sea to learn about ocean currents in real time.\nDrift Cards in the News\nFound: World\'s Oldest Message in a Bottle, Part of 1914 Citizen-Science Experiment: A Scottish fisherman has found the world\'s oldest message in a bottle--98 years old, cast into the ocean by a scientist at the Glasgow School of Navigation, who was studying the currents in the North Sea.\nBottle Cast from Ship in 1959 Discovered on Martha\'s Vineyard Shore: During a winter stroll along the shores of Martha\'s Vineyard in December, 2013, a beachcomber found a bottle cast adrift 54 years ago by a NOAA predecessor agency that set bottles adrift to study ocean currents.\nAfter Floating Around in the Atlantic for 26 Years, NOAA Drift Card Comes Ashore on Irish Beach [PDF, 350 KB]: A small yellow plastic card released off the East Coast of the U.S. was found on a west Ireland beach in summer 2003, after spending 26 years floating in the North Atlantic Ocean.\nAlaska boy finds plastic card 33 years after it was set afloat: A plastic drift card, released near Kodiak, Alaska, from a NOAA vessel in May 1979, was one of thousands NOAA sent into the waters around Alaska in the late 1970s and \'80s. Almost exactly 33 years later, a 12-year-old boy spots the card among some drift logs on a beach at Sealion Cove.\n40-year-old experiment still lingers in the North: An oil field supervisor on Alaska’s North Slope, working at an annual cleanup day in July 2011, found a small, yellow plastic disc on a nearby creek bed. Scientists 30 years ago tossed the disc into the sea as part of a study on Arctic oil spills.\nInteresting Find from the Cleanup - A Drift Card: A NOAA drift card, released in July 1979, was found on the Padre Island National Seashore south of Corpus Christi, Tex. in 2011 by a volunteer in the 16th Annual Billy Sandifer Big Shell Cleanup.', 'What are Plastic Resin Pellets?\n- Plastic resin pellets are the raw material form for the fabrication of plastic articles.\n- They are also known as pre production plastic and as nurdles.\n- Plastic resin also comes in a powdered form.\n- Pellets range from barrel shaped to disc shaped and measure 2 to 5mm.\n- They are usually opaque but accumulate a yellow to brown stain over time in the ocean.\n- Plastic resin pellets are not easily seen and need to be actively looked for.\n- They are found in every ocean and on the coasts of every continent.\n- Tangaroa Blue Ocean Care Society first detected plastic resin pellets while conducting a survey of small plastic fragments at Quarry Bay in early 2007.\n- Since then they have been found on all beaches we survey from Cape Naturalist to Cape Leeuwin.\n- Their observed distribution has ranged from being lightly scattered along strand lines on open sandy beaches to a concentration greater than 6000 per square metre in a site which traps debris moving along the coast.\n- Plastic resin pellets are largely out of site or buried during summer but become very mobile and more visible during winter onshore conditions.\nWhere do Plastic Resin Pellets come from?\n- Alarming volumes of plastic resin pellets are spilt around the globe each year during shipping, land transport and handling at plastic fabrication sites.\n- Pellets are flushed out to sea via river creek and drainage systems and both wash up on adjacent or remote coasts and circulate in the ocean currents1 .\n- On any coast there is likely a mix of regionally spilt and globally circulating pellets.\nWhy are Plastic Resin Pellets a problem?\n- All plastic remaining in the ocean system fragments over time into microscopic pieces and the smaller the size the greater the hazard potential to the whole range of marine life.\n- Plastic resin pellets resemble both fish eggs and when stained they can also resemble krill.\n- Their ingestion can cause internal blockages in smaller sea and bird life.\n- But what new research is showing could be by far the most serious threat posed particularly by plastic resin pellets and generally by all plastic in the marine environment. Plastic Resin Pellets act as a conduit for Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) into the Marine Food web.\nWhat are Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)?\n- Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), a complete global pollution story in themselves, are industrial and agricultural chemicals such as PCBs and DDE (a breakdown product of DDT) which enter the ocean system.\n- Persistent Organic Pollutants also have a global land and atmospheric presence2 .\n- Japanese researchers at the University of Agriculture and Technology in Tokyo have recently found that plastic resin pellets absorb these chemicals from seawater.\n- Concentrations on the pellets in one of their tests were one million times compared to the levels in the surrounding seawater3 & 4 .\n- Tangaroa Blue Ocean Care Society has sent samples of plastic resin pellets to Internation Pellet Watch in Japan for testing.\nEffects of Persistent Organic Pollutants on life\n- Persistent organic pollutants are now proven to be Endocrine Disruptors – synthetic chemical compounds which interfere in differing ways and rates, with the hormonal functioning of organisms. http://www.ourstolenfuture.org/\n- Growth, development and reproduction all can be affected in organisms from plankton through to humans.\n- The concentration of persistent organic pollutants magnifies as they are passed up through the food chain.\n- Plastic resin pellets with these absorbed chemicals pose the potential of injecting far greater concentrations into the food chain at particular (trophic) levels.\nWhat can be done about Plastic Resin Pellets?\n- It is not possible to extract globally circulating small to microscopic plastic including plastic resin pellets from the marine environment.\n- The initial focus should therefore be on stopping the spillages and preventing marine pollution generally.\n- Pellets circulating through heavily polluted seas in one part of the world can then carry their toxic load into remote areas thus posing a threat in relatively unpolluted areas. From our limited surveys at least 10% of pellets show significant staining and presumed contamination. This demonstrates that an area such as the capes coastal region which is largely free of local industrial pollution sources can none the less become polluted with chemicals such as, DDE, PCBs and Dioxins.\n- All marine plastic debris carries some level of these persistent chemicals and in that sense plastic resin pellets stand out as a marker for this marine pollution process.\n- Awareness of this issue in Australia is not high but its ramifications are very serious. A scientific assessment of the persistent organic pollutant – marine plastic pollution problem is urgently needed as is monitoring of our local and regional inputs of plastic resin pellets into the marine environment.\n- “AB 258: Getting Over The Nurdle Hurdle” – Heal The Bay Organisation\n- United Nations Envirnment Programme website\n- “A Brief Analysis of Organic Pollutants Sorbed to Pre and Post-Production Plastic Particles from the Los Angeles and San Gabriel River Watersheds ” by C.

42	reader engagement strategies digital platforms donor relationship building methods compare	Digital platforms employ various strategies to build and maintain user relationships. In the publishing sector, sites like AnOwl create engagement through interactive features such as cooking videos based on book recipes, podcasts, and an online community where readers can connect with writers. They carefully select content to match reader preferences and maintain quality standards. Similarly, in the nonprofit sector, organizations build donor relationships through personalized outreach, regular communication about impact, and strategic timing of campaigns (particularly during year-end giving season). Both approaches focus on creating ongoing connections - publishers through content and community features, and nonprofits through personalized engagement and impact updates.	['A NEW Thai-language website full of literary fiction debuted last Monday – and immediately crashed because fan interest overloaded its server. The founders got the technical glitch resolved and more than 4,000 people could resume reading. It’s a number that’s bound to rise much further.\nThe key founders of AnOwl are three novelists who were already popular under the pennames Piyaporn Sakkasem, Pongsakorn and Kingchat.\nPiyaporn – real name Nantaporn Sarntigasem – is the author of such hit titles as “Tawan Tor Saeng”, “Sai See Plueng” and “Rak Nakara”. The many fiction-friendly magazines that have folded in recent years left writers and readers without a “meeting point”, she says.\n“The magazines provided a stage for writers to present their work under the care of professional editors. The readership hasn’t declined, but the consumer’s media-consumption behaviour changed. We want to fill the empty hole with an online community for readers and writers.”\nAnOwl aims to fill the folded magazines’ role as meeting points for authors and readers.\nThey needed a name for the site that was meaningful in both Thai and English. AnOwl fits the bill because the owl in Western culture symbolises wisdom, and AnOwl resembles the Thai for “reading for (a specific purpose)”.\nAnOwl is billed as a weekly magazine with novels forming the backbone of the free content. Piyaporn, Kingchat (Parichat Salicupt) and Pongsakorn (Dr Pongsakorn Chindawatana) share the editorial duties. Another five founding members have worked in the publishing business for many years.\n“In these days of digital news, more and more people are turning to social media, resulting in a constant decline in readership for conventional newspapers and magazines,” says Kingchat, whose best sellers include “Pornprom Onlawaeng”, “Sera Daran”, “Buag Hong” and “Sood Saneh Ha”.\n“The time has come for us to adapt to the interactive digital platform, but we need to retain the high quality of a good magazine. We’ll try to keep our content free as long as possible because we don’t want to burden our readers.”\nThe inaugural content is 10 novels, free for the reading.\nThe initial content is 10 novels that have never been published – by both celebrated and emerging writers. More will be added later.\nOn the computer or phone screen, the pages look like those of a magazine, and there’s a cover and preface as with hard-copy books. There are also articles – trade news, reviews and other items of interest.\n“When magazines were flourishing, any author who got his work published earned an automatic guarantee regarding his writing ability,” says Pongsakorn, who has garnered acclaim for the novels “Roi Mai”, “Sab Phusa” and “Kol Kimono”. All three were adapted for television.\nThree noted authors are among the site’s founders – by their pennames from left, Pongsakorn, Kingchat and Piyaporn Sakkasem.\n“The three of us rose to fame thanks to the editors at the magazines who coached us about suitable content and proper timing,” he says. “From our experience working with them, we can now carefully select the novels and articles appearing at AnOwl. The readers won’t feel that they’re jumping into a sea of content.”\nCurrently on the site is Pongsakorn’s new novel, “Irrawaddy Kliew Krasip”, inspired by the Burmese sacking of Ayutthaya in 1767, when thousands of citizens were carried off into slavery.\nPiyaporn’s latest novel, “Duangjai Rabai See”, is also there, comparing the characters of three men living in New York, Giverny and Auvers-sur-Oise to the colours of red, yellow and blue, based on paintings by Toulouse-Lautrec, Monet and Van Gogh.\nAnd Kingchat continues her series about the mythical Himmapan Forest in “Nin Nakin”, this time using a fresh penname, Alina.\nSoi Hong Saeng by Mala Kamchan\nPongsakorn says it’s “an honour” to be publishing the new work “Soi Hong Saeng” by SEA Write Award winner Mala Kamchan. “He was writing the novel for Khwan Ruen magazine, but it shut down before he was finished.”\nTo keep the content free for as long as possible, none of the contributors are asking for remuneration.\n“There are many fiction sites open to rookie writers and it’s hard for any one writer to stand out,” says Piyaporn. “One site might be bombarded with 50,000 submissions, so the readers also have difficulty picking one that meets their preferences.\n“So, since we were born from magazines like Sakulthai and Khwan Ruen, we want our site to be a platform for emerging writers and we carefully select works that are interesting and touching.”\nAmong the new faces is the pen-named Parb, whose detective fiction “Kahon Mahorlatueg” was adapted for a TV drama that’s currently airing on One Channel. His new work, “Ling Padkorn”, is a murder mystery.\nAlso new on the scene is Karn, whose favourite authors are Agatha Christie and Stephen King. His debut novel is “The Never-ending (Love) Story”.\nNew fiction website AnOwl.co is a digital magazine of carefully selected novels by both celebrated and emerging authors. For now, at least, it’s all free.\nPongsakorn says his personal favourite at the moment is the writer using the penname Nak Hayra, whose work is normally found online. “She graduated in history and has spent more than a decade in South Korea. Her style is very interesting. Her new work with us, ‘Phusa Haeng Racha’, is about the Japanese occupation of Korea during the war.”\nApatsaphorn Supapa, who writes as Pasrasaa, presents her new mystery story at AnOwl, “Game Archa”, with an equestrian theme.\nApatsaphorn, 35, says she’s “a loyal fan” of the site’s founding authors and didn’t hesitate to contribute when they invited her.\n“I wasn’t even born during the heyday of magazines, so usually I publish at sites like Dek-d and Fictionlog. There are a lot of fiction websites today, but AnOwl stands out because the works are so well screened.”\nEven with so many channels available to writers, says Apatsaphorn – who’s written more than 40 works of fiction in the past 15 years – it’s still not easy to get recognised.\n“Older writers had the magazines, but my generation relies mainly on word of mouth. To become famous, we have to be disciplined and determined and write about what we’re really interested in.”\nThe founders say readership hasn’t declined, but rather consumer behaviour has changed.\nAn article on AnOwl pays tribute to the late beloved editor Suphat Sawasdirak of Sakulthai weekly magazine, which recently closed after more than 60 years. Sakulthai was the foremost magazine for novelists and gave many noted authors their start, such as Tomyantee and Krisna Asoksin.\nAlso planned is a series of videos with authors helping chefs prepare dishes mentioned in their books. Ready for posting are demonstrations of how to make the souffle that Kingchat featured in “Sood Saneh Ha” and the oily cooked rice Pongsakorn dreamed up for “Irrawaddy Kliew Krasip”.\nReaders will soon find a podcast as well, and an audio series about what’s happening in publishing circles.\nIncome will be raised through workshops that are being organised on writing fiction, together with the field trips tracking the footsteps of characters in novels.\n“I was groomed by Suphat Sawasdirak – such a talented editor,” says Piyaporn. “She once compared a magazine to a meal of dishes cooked with different techniques – boiling, stir-frying, sauteeing, currying, frying, plus desserts and fruit – that satisfies every taste. We want AnOwl to be like that too.”\nHOMES ON THE NET\nKeep up to date at www.AnOwl.co and follow the “anowldotco” page on Facebook.', 'While it’s widely understood that nonprofits raise funds to support their important causes, nonprofits themselves incur their own costs. These costs—such as renting an office space, compensating employees, and paying the bills—aren’t covered in restricted fundraising campaigns, such as capital campaigns. That’s why annual giving, which supports the daily costs incurred by nonprofits, is an essential fundraising effort for nonprofits each year.\nWhat is Annual Giving?\nAccording to BWF, annual giving encompasses a nonprofit’s efforts to receive donations and funds received for daily operations, ongoing projects and initiatives, and other activities for which an organization might not have a specific fund set aside. Essentially, annual giving describes the initiatives that a nonprofit or university carries out to raise reliable funding throughout the year.\nWhile annual giving is essential throughout the year, the year-end giving season is the most important time of year for annual fundraising. With Giving Tuesday occurring near the end of November and inspiring giving across the nonprofit sector, it serves as a great opportunity to capitalize on year-end generosity.\nIn addition to Giving Tuesday donations, year-end giving is popular through the December holiday season not only because of the spirit of generosity during this time but also because it’s the last chance donors have to make a tax-deductible donation for the year. In fact, according to Nonprofits Source’s 2022 Charitable Giving Statistics, 30% of annual giving occurs in December, and 10% of annual giving occurs on the last 3 days of the calendar year.\nWhy is Annual Giving Important?\nAnnual giving can be a reliable source to help fund your organization’s ongoing programs and projects. As an ongoing initiative, annual giving allows your nonprofit to fulfill its mission, as well as communicate its mission on a regular basis. Additionally, annual giving comprises unrestricted funds. This means that, unlike an endowment, these funds are not confined to being used for a specific purpose but can be used for continual improvements to your organization.\nWhen they’re well-thought-out, annual giving campaigns can also help form stronger donor relationships and build a donor pipeline that continually transforms prospective donors into actual supporters. Donors can support your organization at any point throughout the year, allowing them to feel connected to your nonprofit and its purpose. Annual giving allows your donors to express their loyalty, which helps them feel that they’re making an impact, while also allowing your organization to identify your most loyal supporters.\nHow to Plan a Successful Annual Giving Campaign\nIf you’re ready to get started with building an annual giving campaign for your organization in the upcoming calendar year, there are a few key considerations. As you’re planning your annual giving strategy, keep in mind the following recommendations:\n- Set your goals for the year. How much is your nonprofit hoping to raise for its annual fund? Calculate your current expenses plus ongoing projects as a starting point. Then, set a goal that is achievable while still striving to exceed your past fundraising totals.\n- Identify prospective donors. Annual giving is a great way to identify your most loyal donors, but when you’re first starting your annual giving campaign, you’ll have to segment who these potential loyal donors will be. Send your annual giving requests not only to previous donors but to other types of supporters—such as volunteers and event registrants—as well.\n- Create a compelling message. Why should your supporters donate to your annual giving campaign? You should be able to answer this question before you launch your campaign. Remind supporters of your message and what specific projects and operations will be impacted by their donations.\n- Personalize outreach. Supporters provide data about their likes and interests every time they interact with your nonprofit. What types of events are they attending? What causes and campaigns are particularly important to them? Make sure to segment your outreach with the data and demographic information your nonprofit gathers.\n- Make it easy to donate. Make sure to optimize your online donation tools and donation forms to make giving simple for both mobile and desktop users. If you’re launching your campaign via email, include a link to your donation form. If you’re sending direct mail, include a QR code to your donation page.\n- Express appreciation for donors.

43	what military units did franks deploy against acre in third crusade campaign	The Franks deployed Bombard Cannons, Paladins, and Hand Cannoneers during their attack. They also had a large force of Siege Rams that they used in their initial assault.	"['The Lion and the Demon is the sixth and final scenario of the Saladin campaign in Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings. It is based on the Siege of Acre (August 28, 1189 - July 12, 1191) during the Third Crusade.\nIntro[edit | edit source]\nThe City of Acre. Nearly twenty-one years have I ridden with Saladin...\nWhen word of the Saracen victory at Jerusalem reached Europe, another Crusade was launched. The kings of the three most powerful nations in Europe - England, France, and the Holy Roman Empire - embarked for the Holy Land with hundreds of thousands of troops.\nSaladin knows that his most dangerous opponent is Richard the Lionhearted of England, a brilliant tactician who learned the art of war fighting against his own father.\nHe builds colossal fortresses and fights always from the front lines - the ideal of a romantic warrior.\nRichard\'s army has come ashore near Acre. Much of Saladin\'s army is trapped in the city, while two monstrous English trebuchets pound at Acre\'s walls. If Richard can defeat our army here, then he can walk into Jerusalem unopposed.\nSaladin knows that this is the climax of his jihad. All the Crusader states have fallen. If the Saracens can hold onto Acre, then the Europeans will be forced to return home.\nIf Acre falls, then the centuries-long nightmare of eternal war, raid, and counterraid, begin again. All Saladin\'s victories will be for nothing.\nScenario Instructions[edit | edit source]\nStarting Conditions[edit | edit source]\n- Starting Age: Imperial Age\n- Starting resources: 500 food, 1500 wood, 1000 gold, 1000 stone\n- Population limit: 75 (100 in the Definitive Edition)\n- Starting units:\nObjectives[edit | edit source]\n- Construct a Wonder and defend it.\nHints[edit | edit source]\n- Saladin is restricted to a population limit of 75/100.\n- When you are ready to build the Wonder, you can delete some of your Houses to make room for it.\n- Attacking one of your enemies early can benefit you later on, but be careful venturing outside Acre\'s walls.\n- Managing a large city can be confusing. It might prove helpful to rebuild military buildings where you can easily find them.\nScouts (Definitive Edition)[edit | edit source]\nYour scouts report:\n- Saladin (1, Green) controls Acre a well fortified city on the coast, which is currently surrounded by the crusader armies.\n- The Genoese (6, Cyan), Franks (2, Blue), and the Knights Templar (5, Yellow) camp to the north. The Genoese will construct warships, while the Franks will train Knights, Hand Cannoneers and Bombard Cannons. The Knights Templar will send in Teutonic Knights and rams.\n- To the east, Richard the Lionheart (4, Red) and Jerusalem (3, Grey) have taken their positions. The English will for the most part rely on their feared Longbowmen, while Jerusalem will send Light Cavalry and swordsmen into battle.\nPlayers[edit | edit source]\nPlayer[edit | edit source]\n- Player (Saracens): The player starts with a fortified city in the center of the map.\nAllies[edit | edit source]\n- Persian Outpost (Persians): The Persian Outpost is located in the south of the map. They send the player five Elite War Elephants after some time has passed. They own a Transport Ship near their Dock protected by a Guard Tower.\nEnemies[edit | edit source]\n- Franks (Franks): The Franks have their base in the north of the map, between the Genoese and the Knights Templar. They deploy Bombard Cannons, Paladins, and Hand Cannoneers. They also have a large force of Siege Rams that they will use in their initial attack on the player.\n- Jerusalem (Byzantines, Franks in the Definitive Edition): Jerusalem has its base in the east of the map. They field Champions, Light Cavalry (in the Definitive Edition), Camels (in HD), Onagers, and Trebuchets.\n- Richard (Britons): Richard occupies a region northeast of Acre, and trains Longbowmen, Scorpions, and Cavaliers. He also commands the Bad Neighbor and God\'s Own Sling.\n- Knights Templar (Teutons): The Knights Templar are found in the north, between Richard and the Franks. They field Elite Teutonic Knights, Paladins, and Capped Rams.\n- Genoese (Byzantines, Italians in the Definitive Edition): The Genoese have their base in the far north. They attack the player\'s city with naval armadas, but do not field any units on land (in the Definitive Edition, they occasionally train Light Cavalry).\nStrategy[edit | edit source]\n|This page or section may need to be cleaned up to reach a higher standard of quality.\nThis strategy also works if you play at the Hardest difficulty in The Age of Kings and build the Wonder at the very beginning to maximize the difficulty.\n- Assign Villagers, Fishing Ships to work.\n- Garrison Archers of the Eyes into The Accursed Tower, The Tower of Flies, Castles and/or Keeps. (recommended The Accursed Tower, Keeps, Castles, then The Accursed Tower).\n- Leave Siege Onagers in the city, behind Walls, Gates. Try to keep them alive.\n- Move Mamelukes, Heavy Cavalry Archers outside Acre, kill any siege units, hit, run. Move to base if needed. Enemies can\'t attack without siege units.\n- Try not to spend resources on anything but Elite Mamelukes, Plate Barding Armor, Blast Furnace, Bracer, Conscription(, Zealotry).\n- Create 40 or 60 Elite Mamelukes.\n- Research Galleons, Chemistry.\n- Create 10 Galleons or construct Keep(s) and/or Castle(s) at west Walls, near The Tower of Flies to kill Genoese warships.\n- Divide 40 or 60 Mamelukes into 2 groups of 20 or 30 Elite Mamelukes. 1 group defends north. Other defends west. Elite Mamelukes can survive outside Acre city, kill anything. Still, pay attention, micromanage them.\n- Kill Franks, Knights Templar\'s siege units whenever possible. Their Siege Workshops are exposed from Castles.\n- When Persian Outpost sends 5 Elite War Elephants, all Enemies will attack with full force. It can be too hard to kill everything before enemies chase your army into base. If you attacked Franks, Knights Templar\'s siege units, you can focus on Richard\'s and Jerusalem\'s siege units. Use Siege Onagers to kill Knights Templar\'s Capped Rams.\n- Construct 1 Gate in the west Walls near water for Lumberjacks to get to new Trees if you run out of Trees in your base. Your Mameluke army should be big and strong enough to protect Lumberjacks.\n- You can construct Wonder or defeat enemies. Enemies\' attacks will be weak.\nEasy victory[edit | edit source]\n- Note: This strategy no longer works in the Definitive Edition, as the outlying islands are too small for a Wonder.\nAnother path to victory is to use the small island, stocked full of gold, in the sea just west of Acre, which is just big enough to build the wonder. First create a Transport Ship and use your 4 Galleons to find the island and set them to ""no attack stance"", only attack if the Genoese attacks you. Then create 6 new villagers.\nOnce you have 15 villagers sail with them to the island. There, forget about the attacks in the city and create a Mining Camp to deplete the 2 gold reserves in the south. Now you should have enough space to build the wonder and win.\nOutro[edit | edit source]\nThe first year of my freedom...\nThe fighting is over. The fire has gone out of Richard\'s lust for conquest. The two respected adversaries started speaking, finally, of peace.\nWar is not gentle with men\'s health. Richard fell ill with a fever. Because he respected his enemy, Saladin sent Richard fruit and mountain snow to comfort him. Soon enough, Richard boarded a ship headed back to England. The Third Crusade is over.\nThe final treaty was signed on September 2, 1192. By its terms, Jerusalem remains in Saracen hands, but Christian pilgrims are to be allowed to visit all the holy places, freely and safely. It seems a fitting compromise to a war that has been fought over religion and land.\nThe war is over, but I do not think I shall ever see Normandy again. I want to see the steel foundries in Damascus and the gardens of the Caliph in Baghdad. I have never seen the mighty Krak des Chevalliers, now-fallen fortress of the Knights Templar. The Holy Land has many wondrous sights, and I can spend a lifetime here.\nIt is peace in the Holy Land... for the moment. Sadly, in a land so small, home to so many different cultures, birthplace of three of the world\'s great religions, I suspect that blood may one day stain the sand again.\nTrivia[edit | edit source]\n- In the Definitive Edition, the ""Offense is the Best Defense"" achievement can be earned by defeating all enemies instead of building the Wonder.\n- In the original or HD Edition, the player can build the Wonder on an island west on the map, making the player\'s gameplay much easier than building it in Acre. This is no longer the case in the Definitive Edition, as the previous spot is covered by rocks. The island doesn\'t actually exist in reality, in any case.\nHistorical comparison[edit | edit source]\n- Like The Battle of Falkirk, The Emperor Sleeping, and Broken Spears, this is a final scenario representing a decisive defeat of the playable faction, and the player is asked to change history by winning it. In real life, Acre fell to the Crusaders, the garrison was slaughtered, and the city became the new capital of the Kingdom of Jerusalem until it fell to the Mamelukes in 1291.\n- After the battle, Richard the Lionheart took the coastal cities as far south as Jaffa and defeated Saladin there and at Arsuf, but could not advance on Jerusalem. Then they signed the peace treaty described in the outro.\n- The narrator shares his desire to visit the ""fallen Templar fortress"" of Krak des Chevaliers. The Krak was actually controlled by the Hospitallers and it remained in their hands until 1271.\n- The battle operated as a ""siege within a siege"", with the Crusaders besieging Acre by land and sea, and Saladin\'s main army attacking the Crusaders from behind in order to relieve the trapped garrison. This format was not used because the developers found it too reminiscent of the Alesia scenario in the Ave Caesar campaign of Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome, even though the player would have the opposite role in this scenario.\n- The siege was started by the disgraced king consort of Jerusalem, Guy of Lusignan, after he was denied entry in Tyre (the only Crusader city to successfully resist Saladin) by Conrad of Montferrat. Lusignan was slowly joined by ships and Crusaders from France, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, and Cilician Armenia, as well as Knights Templar, Hospitaller, and the reluctant Montferrat.\n- The three royal armies mentioned in the intro arrived at a later phase. The first was the remains of Frederick Barbarossa\'s German and Hungarian army, led by his son the Duke Frederick VI of Swabia, and after he died, by Duke Leopold V of Austria. They are not represented in the scenario (even though Austria\'s banner was raised over the conquered city), but Teutons are still featured as the Knights Templar.\n- Finally, the Crusaders were joined by the armies of Richard the Lionheart and Philip II of France, and a Genoese fleet (represented respectively by ""Richard"", ""Franks"", and ""Genoese""). Of these, the most powerful was actually Philip II, who was also the owner of Bad Neighbor and God\'s Own Sling (or God\'s Stone Thrower), not Richard (although Richard built two other Trebuchets for his own use). Richard only became de facto leader of the Crusaders in the aftermath of the siege, due to:\n- The death of Queen Sybilla of Jerusalem (Lusignan\'s wife) and her succession by her sister Isabella, who married Montferrat. Montferrat retired to Tyre instead of accompanying Richard south.\n- The German army leaving after Richard and Philip refused to treat Leopold as their equal and torn down his flag from the ramparts of Acre.\n- Philip II leaving to sort out the inheritance of his vassal Philip I of Flanders, who had died in the siege.\n- The ""Persian Outpost"" is probably a reference to a Muslim fleet that managed to break the Crusaders\'s blockade and bring reinforcements, food, and weapons to the garrison by sea - but surely not war elephants.\n- Genoa is an Italian city. Because the Italians were not included until The Forgotten, they are represented by the Byzantines. In the Definitive Edition, the Genoese are properly represented by the Italians.']"	['<urn:uuid:947e5b25-66d5-45fd-ac30-8d36b9ab7be6>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	12	28	2093
44	As a music historian researching Icelandic culture, I'd love to know more about Keflavík's connection to the music scene - what's its significance in Iceland's music history?	Keflavík has been known as 'The Beatles Town' and is the hometown of many of Iceland's most popular bands over the last decades. The city houses The Icelandic Museum of Rock 'n' Roll, a modern museum with interesting presentations that showcases the history of Icelandic pop and rock music.	"[""14 places to visit on Reykjanes Peninsula\nReykjanes Peninsula is perhaps one of the most underrated places in Iceland. It’s the home of Keflavik International Airport, and most tourists drive straight from there to Reykjavik without so much as a stop for a look around, aside for a visit to the Blue Lagoon. They don't know what they're missing.\nThe landscape at the peninsula is rough and a bit alien looking. There isn’t all that much grass, instead there are great lava fields covered in moss. There are old craters, fissures and bubbling, geothermal mud pools. By the sea there are many places with amazing rock formations, most of them very dark grey. They are particularly spectacular when the wind is blowing and the sea violently hammers upon the rocks, wave after wave.\nIn addition to the beautiful landscape the culture is interesting. Most of the towns were built up around fisheries, and Icelanders from all over the island came there for work. Others around the US Army base. There are plenty of interesting museum, one of which is dedicated to rock ‘n’ roll.\nKeflavík is known for being the hometown of many of Iceland’s most popular bands over the last decades, and was often referred to as “The Beatles Town”. It is therefore very fitting that it’s the home to The Icelandic Museum of Rock ‘n’ Roll. The museum is modern and the presentation is interesting. It features the history of Icelandic pop and rock music and no music enthusiast should pass by without a visit.\n2. The bridge between continents\nThe boundaries between the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates (one of the causes for Iceland’s volcanos and lunar landscapes) lies right under Reykjanes Peninsula. As the plates are moving in different directions, every now and again the land gives away and large fissures form on the surface. There’s a bridge between one of these fissures close to Sandvík, on the west end of the peninsula. You can either stand up on it or go down into the fissure, and stand on the borders the two tectonic plates.\nBásendar was a trading post which was swept away in a tidal flood in 1799, the biggest disaster of its kind in Iceland. With great luck, every villager escaped save for one elderly woman. The ruins are still there. When you drive from the town Sandgerði towards Stafsnes you’ll happen upon the parking lot and a short hike will get you to Básendar.\nOne of Iceland’s most famous landmarks, The Blue Lagoon. It is indeed the perfect place for a luxury soak in geothermal water filled with minerals which are great for the skin. The buildings are modern and cheek, the service is good. It’s not cheap, but it's unlike anything else.\nThe Blue Lagoon is a popular destination among tourists that visit Iceland. Photo: Iceland Monitor/Gísli Sigurðsson\nThe Blue Lagoon is also the home of what is considered to be one of the best restaurants in Iceland, LAVA. The name may seem pretentious as the word lava is used all over the country to sell all sorts of things to tourists, but as it is located in the middle of a lava field, it’s very fitting. The food is much like the Blue Lagoon itself. Icelandic ingredients in modern, luxurious style.\n6. Gunnuhver geothermal area\nWith bubbling mud pools, boiling water, steam and distinct smell of sulphur, Gunnuhver is one of the most interesting places to visit in Reykjanes Peninsula. It’s named after a ghost who caused quite the stir in the area until a priest trapped her in the pool over 400 years ago.\nViking World is a museum in a beautiful building at the edge of Reykjanesbær. It focuses on, you guessed it, Vikings! The item in the museum is best known for is a great Viking ship, built in 1996 after a 9 th century Viking ship. The builder, Gunnar Marel Eggertsson, sailed the ship to New York in 2000 as a part of the millennial celebration of Leifur Eiríksson’s journey to the New World. There are five exhibitions in the museum, and there is also a playground and a settlement zoo.\nBrimketill is a lava rock formation in the shape of a pool on the edge of the ocean. It is also named Oddnýjarlaug. As the story goes the troll Oddný used to bathe in the pool and wash her clothes there. The view over Brimketill is stunning. Beyond it there is nothing but the Atlantic Ocean open before you. The rocks and lava formations around Brimketill are pitch black against the blue and white of the ocean, which hammers upon the rocks.\nBrimketill is also named Oddnýjarlaug, after the giantess that supposedly bathed there. Photo: Snorri Thor Tryggvason\n9. The Giantess in the Cave\nIceland is a land of folk tales. There are stories of trolls and hidden people living in just about every other rock and hill. One of these creatures lives in a cave by the harbour in Reykjanesbær, a full size giantess. You can stop by for a visit and perhaps snap a picture or two.\n10. Shellfish feast at Vitinn\nReykjanes Peninsula has for centuries be known for the abundance of seafood at its shores. One of the best places to enjoy these is Vitinn restaurant in Sandgerði. It’s not a fancy upscale restaurant, but it's good and they serve some of the best variety of fresh shellfish in Iceland.\nDriving south Krýsuvíkurleið takes you past Kleifarvatn, a large lake which got decreased much in size in an earthquake around 10 years ago. The rock formations around the road are beautiful, formed by volcanic eruptions and split by earthquakes.\nBy the south end of the lake you’ll start to see steam rising up into the air, you are getting closer to Krýsuvík where you’ll find are many geothermal areas with hot springs which you can walk up to (just be careful to stick to the paths so you won’t get burned), old craters and colourful lakes. Grænavatn is particularly beautiful, a lake coloured green by algae thriving in it.\n12. Hafnarberg cliffs\nOne of the many amazing places to watch the ocean beating on the cliffs of the shore in Reykjanes is at Hafnarberg. The cliffs are tall, located just south of town Hafnir, an old fishing town. The area is particularly popular amongst bird watchers, as the cliffs are home to many different species of sea birds.\nThere is something mesmerizing about watching the sea beat upon the cliffs. Photo: Iceland Monitor/Rax / Ragnar Axelsson\nKeilir is distinct, tall, cone shaped mountain in Reykjanes Peninsula, and one of the best known mountains in the area. There’s even a school named after it. The hike up this 380m mountain isn’t very difficult, and the view on a good day makes the effort definetly worth it.\nKeilir is so renowned, there's a school and a golf club named after it. Photo: Iceland Monitor/Ómar Óskarsson\n14. Beach by Reykjanesviti\nReykjanesviti lighthouse stands on a hill and looms over a beautiful beach, marked with tall, straight cliffs. The view from the lighthouse is great but a walk down to the rough beach is even better.""]"	['<urn:uuid:9c95109f-6026-4d25-872f-2c8b2d80226c>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	27	49	1202
45	professional pianist curious about sound characteristics highest notes nine octave piano range	At the highest range of the nine-octave piano, the human ear cannot directly detect which specific notes are being played. However, the brain and ear working together can imagine the sounds at this pitch. The piano also features twinkling top octaves and a profoundly deep bass range, with rich sonority and resonance enhanced by its size and structure.	"[""This incredible piano has 108 keys and a nine-octave range – and it sounds immense\n8 October 2021, 16:31\nMeet the world’s first 108-key piano, handcrafted by one of Australia’s last-remaining piano makers.\nAn independent piano maker has produced the first ever nine-octave piano – and it sounds resplendent.\nAustralian piano maker Wayne Stuart hand-built the 108-key instrument at his independent studio in southern New South Wales.\nThe magnificent grand was crafted with Tasmanian Huon pine, and, measuring a whopping three metres in length, it took 18 months to build.\nPianos typically have 88 keys, and span just over seven octaves, so Stuart’s impressive instrument adds nearly two octaves to the possibilities at pianists’ fingertips.\nRead more: This 19-foot piano has the longest bass strings in the world – and it sounds huge\nSpeaking to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Stuart says, “There has been music around for the 108-key range for quite a long time, and it’s not a peculiar range because it actually mirrors the range of the pipe organ.”\nExpressing enthusiasm for continuing to make his 108-key hand-crafted pianos, Stuart says, “I personally think it’s the minimum frequency range for a piano in the 21st century. I could not stand to sit at an 88-key piano now. I would want to take an axe to it because it's just too limiting.”\nThe standard piano was invented in around 1700 when Italian instrument technician Bartolomeo Cristofori decided it was time to update the harpsichord with a hammer and damper mechanism that could allow for dynamic range – louds and quiets – in the instrument.\nPiano manufacturers designed new pianos with more keys, so that composers like Haydn and Mozart could write more challenging material for a fuller keyboard in the Classical era.\nRead more: A standard piano has 88 keys. But why?\nMan in Australia performs on 108-key piano as he reviews instrument from Stuart & Sons\nRomantic composers and piano virtuosos like Chopin and Liszt made music that continued to demand more from the instrument, and by the late 1880s, piano manufacturer Steinway had created the 88-key piano. Steinway’s model has been the standard ever since.\nAustralian maker Wayne Stuart isn’t the first piano maker to produce an instrument building on the range of the Steinway standard, though.\nThis piano with extended bass strings was invented in New Zealand to enhance the instrument’s lower range a few years back, while this innovative Japanese design took away all the black keys to produce a piano that looks striking and only plays in one key.\nAustralian pianist and composer Ashley Hribar had a go on the nine-octave Stuart piano, demonstrating its twinkling top octaves and profoundly deep bass range.\nHribar’s review (watch above) reveals the rich sonority and resonance of the piano, which is enhanced by the piano’s size and structure. Apart from the extra keys, the piano closely resembles a standard concert grand piano.\nRead more: The ‘invalid piano’ for bedridden individuals was a real-life 1930s musical invention\n“The ear can’t detect which notes they are” at the top of this nine-octave piano, Hribar explains. “But the brain and the ear together can kind of imagine the sounds” at this pitch.\nRead more: This piano doesn’t have any black keys. How will it sound?\nThe instrument was commissioned for AU$300,000 (£160,000) by Anthony Knight, director of Beleura House & Garden in Victoria, who describes it as “the best bloody piano in the world.”\nThe piano maker says, “It’s the 21st century. We need new things. We need new horizons and this is certainly a new horizon.”\nThe piano is now safely at its new Beleura House & Gardens home in Victoria, Australia.""]"	['<urn:uuid:e0d2f43c-84d0-4689-8e85-4b7e19d31cae>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	12	58	613
46	adhd genetic factors diagnosis requirements	ADHD has a strong genetic component, with about 25% of close relatives of ADHD children having similar disorders compared to 5% in the general population. For diagnosis, symptoms must appear before age seven and last at least six months, causing difficulties in multiple settings (school, home, social). The condition cannot be attributed to sudden traumatic events or other medical ailments. While there is no specific diagnostic test for adult ADHD, diagnosis requires a consistent pattern of symptoms verified through patient interviews, questionnaires, and physical tests to rule out other conditions. The worldwide incidence is 3-5% regardless of nationality, with a 6:1 male-to-female ratio in children.	"['[amazon_link asins=’0399573453,1572247665,1462507891,0307743152,1591471559,B019BO2TNG’ template=’ProductCarousel’ store=’finmeacur-20′ marketplace=’US’ link_id=’5a9bd412-cc6e-11e7-b41c-7d66c6b45917′]\nAttention deficit hyperactive disorder or ADHD is erroneously considered to be a 20th century phenomenon affecting mainly children from developed nations. Actually, it was first described in 1845 by a psychiatrist in a boy called â€œfidgety Philipâ€. Today, the worldwide incidence is 3-5 per cent, irrespective of nationality. In referral paediatric clinics, it is as high as 15.5 per cent. The average age at diagnosis is eight years with a 6:1 male-to-female ratio.\nChildren who have the hyperactive impulsive type of ADHD are unbearably fidgety, restless and impatient, always running, jumping, climbing and blurting out inappropriate comments. They often receive corporal punishment from frustrated parents and teachers. Others, with the inattentive type of ADHD, are dreamy and bored, with difficulty in paying attention, learning something new or completing a task. Homework becomes a particular problem, with assignments forgotten, books misplaced and the final unsatisfactorily completed task full of erasures and errors.\nAround 40 per cent of children with ADHD (especially boys) are argumentative, defiant, stubborn, non-compliant and belligerent. They lie, steal, fight, bully others, have temper tantrums and engage in vandalism. Eventually, as teenagers, they may gravitate towards drugs and alcohol.\nTo make a diagnosis of ADHD:\n* The symptoms should have set in before the age of seven years and have lasted for at least six months\n* They should cause difficulties in the childâ€™s life, in school, at play, at home, in the community and in social settings\n* The changes should not have been precipitated by a sudden traumatic event like the death of a parent\n* There should be no diagnosed medical ailments like seizures, middle ear infections or a learning disability to explain the symptoms.\nSociety often finds fault with the parents of children with ADHD. They are criticised for faulty nurturing and lack of parental discipline. But parents are actually helpless, as ADHD has a genetic and neurobiologic basis. Scans have shown that the frontal lobes, temporal grey matter, caudate nucleus and cerebellum of the brains of these children are 34 per cent smaller than normal in volume. Also, the brain has lower levels of a signal-processing chemical called dopamine.\nThe exact reason for these changes is not known. However,\n* ADHD runs in families. About 25 per cent of the close relatives of ADHD children also have similar disorders as opposed to 5 per cent in the general population\n* Women who smoke and drink during pregnancy have a higher incidence of children with ADHD\n* High blood lead levels have been demonstrated in some children with ADHD. This, however, is not a consistent finding\n* A sugar high has been blamed for some of the symptoms. This is a label for the increased level of activity following the ingestion of highly refined sugars or carbohydrates, which enter the bloodstream rapidly and produce fluctuations in blood glucose levels. This is particularly true if (as in the case of cola drinks) the food also contains caffeine (a stimulant) and food additives. Diet restrictions reducing the quantities of such food help in some cases.\nChildren with ADHD hate change in any form. They need a scheduled, regimented life with the same routine every day. All their belongings should also be organised and kept in specific places. With structured care, these children show a great deal of improvement and are able to integrate into society. About 30 to 70 per cent of children with ADHD continue to have symptoms in adult life. Academic excellence â€” a prelude to higher studies and a good job â€” may remain elusive. This is aggravated by poor social skills. They remain easily distracted, hyperactive and impulsive and have difficulty with deadlines, prioritisation and social engagements. Decision-making is an almost insurmountable hurdle. They also have problems holding down a steady job. Many are able to function on computers and are intelligent enough to do programming and other jobs which do not require social interaction. Around 80 per cent need to continue to live with parents or siblings.\nSome children do not improve despite psychotherapy and a structured environment. They require medication with mental stimulants like methylphenidate and atmoxetine. They do well if they take their medication, which may need to be continued into adult life.\nCompetition is fierce in India, for education, jobs, promotions and success. Reservations and capitation fees are a way of life. In this scenario, parents may find it difficult to cope with a hyperactive, inattentive, disobedient and impulsive child who does not conform to social norms.\nIt is often difficult for the parents to accept that their child has ADHD. They feel depressed and guilty, even though it is not their fault. And despite all folklore to the contrary, an arranged marriage to an unsuspecting spouse does not cure the problem.\nSource:The Telegraph (Kolkata, India)', ""While Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD (sometimes referred to as Attention Deficit Disorder, or ADD), is a mental health condition that is most often associated with children, adults can suffer from ADHD, and it can interfere with their ability to work. Although approximately 4% of adults are believed to have ADHD, some of them have not been diagnosed with the condition. Up to a third of those diagnosed as children with ADHD continue to have ADHD symptoms in adulthood.\nAdults with disabling symptoms of ADHD may be eligible to receive Social Security disability benefits.\nDisabling Symptoms of Adult ADHD\nADHD causes the same types of symptoms in both children and adults, including trouble paying attention, hyperactivity, poor time management and organizational skills, forgetfulness, and impulsive behavior. (As there is no adult-onset ADHD, these characteristics must have been present since childhood.)\nFor adults with ADHD, these symptoms can result in employment difficulties, poor relationships, and emotional problems. A significant number of adults with ADHD never finished high school because of academic troubles due to ADHD, and this can also limit their employment potential.\nThere is no diagnostic test for adult ADHD. It can be diagnosed by a medical doctor, psychiatrist, or psychologist when a patient exhibits a consistent pattern of symptoms including inattention and hyperactivity. An official adult ADHD diagnosis usually comes following interviews with the patient and others who are familiar with their symptoms. There are also several questionnaires and checklists that are sometimes used to diagnose ADHD. And before diagnosing an adult with ADHD, most doctors will perform a physical test to rule out other conditions.\nQualifying for Disability Based on Adult ADHD\nTo qualify for Social Security disability, you must prove that you are unable to sustain any type of full-time employment. The Social Security Administration (SSA) isn't overly concerned with your official diagnosis; they are most interested in how your disability (or disabilities) affects your everyday functioning, and thus your ability to work. So, if you're applying for disability due to an adult ADHD diagnosis, it's imperative that you are able to demonstrate how your ADHD significantly impacts your ability to do typical work activities such as remembering, concentrating, and staying on task.\nIf the SSA agrees your condition is severe, it will create a mental residual capacity (RFC) for you, an assessment that shows what level of work you can do, such as skilled work, semi-skilled work, simple, unskilled work, or no work. The SSA then uses your mental RFC to assess whether you can do any jobs. For more information, see our article on how your mental RFC determines whether you get disability benefits.\nEvidence Needed When Applying for SSD for Adult ADHD\nDue to the subjective nature of an adult ADHD diagnosis, it's essential to have strong supporting evidence in order to get your disability claim approved. The SSA will want to see written documentation of your symptoms from sources such as doctors, employers, and teachers. Ideally, your SSD claim file should include:\nrecords from a psychiatrist or psychologist showing a specific diagnosis of adult ADHD, with supporting documentation (doctor's notes, questionnaires, and so on)\ndocumentation of what treatment methods (medication, therapy) you've tried and what the outcome was\nrecords from former employers that demonstrate your difficulties with concentration, hyperactivity, impulsivity, or other ADHD symptoms\nacademic records displaying ADHD indicators such as late assignments, poor grades, and missed classes (or other verification that you had ADHD or ADD symptoms as a child and it affected your school work), and\n- a detailed form (medical source statement) completed by the therapist who is treating you for your ADHD, indicating their opinion as to the severity of your condition and its effect on your daily activities.\nBe sure to include information on any other physical or mentla problems as well. It is not uncommon for adults who have been diagnosed with ADHD to also have another psychological condition, such as depression, drug abuse problems, an anxiety disorder, or antisocial personality disorder. If you suffer from another physical or psychological condition that contributes to your inability to work, the SSA will consider the combined effects of your disabilities. Having other significant limitations could increase the chances that your disability application will be approved.\nHow Treatment for ADHD Affects Disability\nTreatment for adult ADHD most commonly involves the use of prescription stimulant medications such as Adderall or Concerta. If the patient has a history of substance abuse or cardiac problems, there are also non-stimulant medications that can be prescribed. Adults with ADHD can also benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy, counseling, or coaching to help them learn new ways of thinking and doing things that they struggle with. Although many adults with ADHD show significant improvement with the appropriate treatment, some may not. The SSA will want to know what the patient's past and current treatments have been and that the patient is not failing to comply with your doctor's treatment plan by taking the prescribed medication.\nApplying for Disability with Adult ADHD\nYou can apply for Social Security disability benefits by visiting your local SSA office or calling the SSA at 800-772-1213. Adults with severe ADHD will likely need assistance with the application process.\nAfter your completed application is submitted, the SSA will forward your file to your state's Disability Determination Services (DDS), the agency that handles medical determinations in SSD cases. You will receive a letter with the name and phone number of the claims examiner who is handling your case. Three to four months later, you should receive a decision by mail (although it can take longer). If your claim was denied, you will be able to appeal the decision by filing a disability appeal within 60 days of your receipt of the denial letter.\nLearn about ADHD in children in our article on SSI disability benefits for children with ADHD.""]"	['<urn:uuid:dd34773b-1558-4171-aa7e-15b1cbbe10f6>', '<urn:uuid:eb87b065-25b2-4c5f-bba3-68c29ff51635>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	5	105	1780
47	microbial world statistics cells viruses count earth how many prokaryotic cells and viruses exist	In the microbial world, there are approximately 5 × 10^30 prokaryotic cells (bacteria and archaea) on Earth. The number of viruses is even more impressive, being 10-100 times higher than the number of prokaryotic cells.	"[""The origins of microbial adaptations: how introgressive descent, egalitarian evolutionary transitions and expanded kin selection shape the network of life\n- 1UPMC, Institut de Biologie Paris Seine, UMR7138 ‘Evolution Paris Seine’, Paris, France\n- 2CNRS, Institut de Biologie Paris Seine, UMR7138 ‘Evolution Paris Seine’, Paris, France\nMicrobial Evolution: a Genealogical Perspective\nProtists, bacteria and archaea (the prokaryotes), and their mobile genetic elements populate the microbial world. This world is ancient (several billion years old), numerically huge (with 5 × 1030 prokaryotic cells and 10–100 times more viruses!), and genetically extremely diversified. Such a large assemblage cannot be ignored in attempts to understand life's history on Earth, however, how can biologists account for its evolution?\nFor long, the notion of descent with modification, describing a process of vertical inheritance, defining a tree-like genealogical pattern, when the genetic material, modified by some mutations, is transferred from the genome of a last common ancestor to its direct progeny has offered a promising way to classify organisms and species. Thus, the origin of microbial adaptations can be searched for within lineages, in the changes of genetic material inherited from one ancestor. Yet, such studies are strongly constrained. Non-tree like evolution, generating a reticulate evolutionary pattern, cannot be analyzed with a genealogical tree. Moreover, viruses do not all originate from a single last ancestor (Lima-Mendez et al., 2008), nor do they all display obvious genealogical relationships with cellular organisms, hindering the collective study of mobile genetic elements and cells with a single tree.\nGenealogy also plays a central role for explaining the main types of behaviors described in the biological world: selfishness, mutualism, altruism, and spite (West et al., 2006). The evolution of these interactions can be understood by accounting for kinship between protagonists, under the standard assumption that genealogical proximity between individuals entails their genetic proximity (Huneman, 2013). Thus, knowing the relative kinship, the benefit for the recipient of an interaction and the cost for its actor allows determining when an individual cooperating with a kin, in ways enhancing its reproduction, or preventing distantly related members of a population to reproduce, actually maximizes the reproductive success and the survival of its own genes (van Baalen, 2013). Microbiologists are thus inclined to embrace the conceptual framework of kin selection to analyze many cooperations (Diggle et al., 2007).\nHowever, it is probably not enough to take genealogical relationships into account to explain the diversity, evolution, and interactions in the microbial world. Too systematic a focus on genealogy may even introduce some biases in the explanations of microbial diversity, evolution and interactions, because many crucial biological phenomena result from processes orthogonal to vertical descent.\nExpanding the Analytical Framework Inspired by Genealogy\nThe multiplicity of evolutionary processes, their consequences, and the interactions at play within the microbial world are still under-appreciated. The genealogical perspective grounding evolutionary explanations needs to be completed, because its analytical framework does not accommodate for numerous important biological phenomena, which deeply challenge our background knowledge of the (microbial) world and its evolution.\nIntrogression: a Class of Non-Tree-Like Evolutionary Processes\nDue to introgressive descent, many adaptations originate from outside rather than from within lineages of vertical descent. While in vertical descent, the genetic material of a particular evolutionary unit is propagated by replication inside its own lineage, in introgressive descent, the genetic material of a particular evolutionary unit propagates into different host structures and is replicated within these host structures (Bapteste et al., 2012). Such host structures are genealogically composite, made of components with distinct genealogical origins. Importantly, introgression is very common in the microbial world, affecting entities from the same or different levels of biological organization. New introgressive mechanisms are constantly discovered (Bapteste, 2013). However, these mechanisms and their actors (viruses, plasmids, conjugative elements, outer membrane vesicles, gene transfer agents, nanotubes, membrane fusion, …) are largely missing from the traditional evolutionary representation. For instance, a gene sequence can propagate into another gene sequence, creating a novel composite gene, whose components come from two different gene lineages. Similarly, a gene sequence can propagate within a genome, whose ancestor lacked this gene, producing a composite genome with genes originating from different genomes. Likewise, the genome of a mobile element (a virus, a plasmid, etc.) can propagate into a cell born without this element, creating a composite cell with genetic instruction from multiple sources. Or, a part or an entire microbial genome can propagate within a symbiotic association, producing a holobiont with several unrelated genomes. Therefore, the recognition of introgression promotes a substantial expansion of the evolutionary research program: a study of the origins (rather than of the origin) of adaptations and species through the description and analysis of a plurality of processes and objects, some unexpected in the traditional genealogical perspective (Doolittle and Bapteste, 2007; Bapteste, 2013).\nGene–Gene Introgression: Massive Gene Remodeling\nHomology guides comparative analysis in evolutionary biology (Haggerty et al., 2013). Sequences or organs are considered homologous when they evolved in a tree-like fashion from an ancestral form. Thus, gene evolution is often described by a tree with one genealogy per gene family. However, many genes originate from the composition of genetic material from sequences belonging to different gene families. Eukaryotes are the main creators of composite genes (in terms of the proportion of composite genes in their genomes) (Haggerty et al., 2013), yet in terms of absolute numbers, mobile genetic elements operate the most massive gene remodeling on Earth (Jachiet et al., 2013). Therefore, numerous genes display family resemblances (Halary et al., 2013): true similarity caused by introgression between non-homologous sequences. Such family resemblances support the study of the origins of genes and of adaptations at a more global scale than delineated by homology.\nGene–Genome Introgression: Remarkable Pangenomes\nAll conspecific individuals do not own the same gene families. Six percent only of their gene families are distributed in all 60 strains of Escherichia coli (Lukjancenko et al., 2010), and experiments showed that only 61 genes out of 246,065 cannot be transferred into an E. coli (Sorek et al., 2007). Members of this species (and many others) exploit a large DNA pool, called pangenome, larger than the size of individual genomes. Therefore, sequencing one individual genome does not always allow describing genetic and functional diversity at the species level. Pangenomes and lateral gene transfer –by small segments or larger chunks- are not restricted to conspecifics (Nelson-Sathi et al., 2012). These observations challenge phylogenetic systematics: they mean that genome evolution is much more than genome genealogy, an increasingly elusive concept, since these objects prove to be ever more composite and their genes do not all coalesce in a single common ancestral genome.\nFrom the Mobilome Network to the Social Network of Life\nMany classes of evolutionary objects (i.e., virus, plasmids, etc.) have fuzzy borders, because many of these objects do not evolve independently at the genetic level. Remarkably, introgression creates novel introgressive mechanisms. Numerous genealogically mosaic mobile elements (autonomous or not: polintons, virophages, R391, phasmides, phage inducible chromosomal islands, transpovirons, etc.) emerge and evolve through the sharing of mobility functions, defining a genetic pool: the pangenome of mobile elements, which unravels a network of shared genes between these elements (Yutin et al., 2013). This network belongs to a larger one: the social network of life, whose edges describe an important biological structure: “what shares genetic material with what,” without prejudices about the process involved in these sharings (in part vertical descent, but also introgression since these sequences can be used as common goods by more than one lineage Halary et al., 2010; McInerney et al., 2011). In this latter network, all entities are not genealogically related, but this does not imply their a priori exclusion from the model. Thanks to its diversity of edges and nodes, the social network of life is more inclusive than the tree of life, supposed to be universal but in fact restricted to one type of relationships between one fraction of biological diversity (Halary et al., 2010).\nThe Challenging Microbial Social Life\nMicrobial social life is hard to explain within the framework of kin selection without (at least) deeply expanding this theory. How do bacteria manage to identify their kins and cooperate? In principle, greenbeard genes provide a way to detect other organisms carrying these genes with which an individual can act cooperatively. However, experimental transfers between strains and species of myxobacteria (M. xanthus and M. fulvus) of the first characterized single greenbeard prokaryotic gene predictably transform their interactions, reprogramming their social interactions. For example, when an isogenic M. xanthus strain expresses a M. fulvus traA allele, both become efficacious partners. Moreover, strains constructed with two alleles of traA cooperate with a broadened range of partners (Pathak et al., 2013). Consequently, the notion of microbial greenbeard gene departs from classical kinship selection: the cooperative behavior targets other individual harboring the same allele, whatever their global genetic proximity. Lateral gene transfer does not only partly uncouple gene and genome evolution, which makes it difficult to conceive of a standard application of kinship within bacterial populations, since bacteria may be similar for some genes without being similar for all, but the transfer of greenbeard genes can also induce cooperation between relatively different microbes. Therefore, cooperation between distantly related individuals must be more largely theorized (Huneman, 2013). The black queen theory provides a good instance of such an explanation in which genealogical relationships between protagonists do not play a role (Morris et al., 2012; Sachs and Hollowell, 2012). This theory would explain why a minority of organisms (Synechococcus harboring the katG gene) are sufficient to reduce the HOOH in ocean surface waters to a level that allows the dominant types (Prochlorococcus and Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique who lost this gene) to thrive.\nConsiderations on the evolution of social life are fundamental: our inability to grow the vast majority of micro-organisms in pure cultures (Staley and Konopka, 1985) may largely come from our too limited knowledge on this topic. Furthermore, our general knowledge in evolutionary microbiology mostly rests on analyses of the rare microbes able to grow in pure cultures. If these organisms are not representative of most of the microbial world, inferences based on a part of this world (e.g., the cultivable microbes) could be mistakenly conflated with general conclusions, which one hopes to be relevant for the whole microbial world. Yet, discoveries such as the Pandoraviruses remind us that much unknown lives outside our Petri dishes (Philippe et al., 2013). Importantly, alleviating some constraints inspired by the genealogical focus is one way to better see the whole rather the parts. Typically, sequences comparison free from the constraints of multiple alignment and a tree-based representation of sequence similarities hints at highly divergent environmental gene forms and lineages, not yet reported in the microbial world (Lynch et al., 2012).\nEgalitarian Evolutionary Transitions and Systems with Microbial Components\nThe three steps of evolutionary transitions: the association of entities, their stabilization, and their transformation (after which entities originally able to reproduce independently are only able to reproduce as part of a larger whole) result either in fraternal transitions (which can be explained by traditional kin selection), when higher level units emerge from genealogically like components, and in egalitarian transitions, when higher level units emerge from genealogically different components (Huneman, 2013). These latter transitions are common in the microbiological literature, e.g., Parakaryon myojinensis (Yamaguchi et al., 2012), the origins of eukaryotes (Alvarez-Ponce et al., 2013), mutualistic viruses and even virophages, seen as components of larger systems (Espagne et al., 2004; Fischer and Suttle, 2011; Roossinck, 2011). The notion of egalitarian evolutionary transition gives credits to the proposal that some elements of microbiomes deserve to be considered as new organs, providing novel physiologies, despite their genealogically different origin from that of the host of these organs (Stahl and Davidson, 2006). The idea that the microbial component influences the physiology and the behavior of the other components of such systems is becoming increasingly popular (Hoover et al., 2011; McFall-Ngai et al., 2013), i.e., the study of mechanisms of the microbial-brain axis, testifying of the fundamental relevance in terms of adaptations of the interactions between the microbial and macrobial worlds (Collins et al., 2012).\nConsequently, many evolutionary objects previously studied as if they were genealogically cohesive organisms or species would rather constitute genealogically heterogeneous systems, composed in parts by microbes or viruses. This microbial contribution to microbe–microbe and microbe–macrobe systems seems a general rule rather than an exception, when one considers the age, abundance, and ubiquity of these minute entities on the planet. This type of discoveries raises a novel fundamental issue: how to model the evolution of systems (and their possible physiological, ecological, and developmental impacts during Earth history), which brings microbial evolutionists very far from the usual reconstruction of a genealogical tree.\nGenealogical tree-thinking should at least be completed by other perspectives (Doolittle and Bapteste, 2007; Bapteste et al., 2012, 2013). For example networks can be used to adapt current models to the data rather than enforcing the data to fit within pre-existing genealogically constrained models, designed in order to analyze objects and processes far less complex than those affecting the microbial world (Bapteste, 2013).\nThe author thanks Dr. Philippe Lopez for critical reading of the MS, and F.

48	How do default rights affect creators and healthcare providers?	When creators have attribution rights by default, they overvalue them four times more than without default rights, affecting transaction efficiency. In healthcare, physical therapists have default rights to evaluate patients without physician referral across all U.S. states, enabling direct access to their services.	"[""What's a Name Worth?: Experimental Tests of the Value of Attribution in Intellectual Property\nChristopher Jon Sprigman\nNew York University School of Law\nYeshiva University - Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law\nZachary C. Burns\nUniversity of Chicago - Booth School of Business\nOctober 15, 2013\nBoston University Law Review, Vol. 93, p. 1, 2013\nVirginia Law and Economics Research Paper No. 2012-02\nChicago-Kent College of Law Research Paper No. 2013-43\nDespite considerable research suggesting that creators value attribution – i.e., being named as the creator of a work – U.S. intellectual property (IP) law does not provide a right to attribution to the vast majority of creators. On the other side of the Atlantic, however, many European countries give creators, at least in their copyright laws, much stronger rights to attribution. At first blush it may seem that the U.S. has gotten it wrong, and the Europeans have made a better policy choice in providing to creators a right that they value. But for reasons we will explain in this Article, matters are a lot more complicated than that.\nThis Article reports a series of experiments that are the first to attempt to quantitatively measure the value of attribution to creators. In previous research, we have shown that creators of IP are subject to a “creativity effect” that results in them assigning substantially higher value to their works than neoclassical economic theory predicts. The first two experiments reported in this Article suggest a way that the creativity effect may be reduced – creators are willing to sacrifice significant economic payments in favor of receiving attribution for their work. The value to creators of attribution raises the question whether U.S. IP law should be re-structured to provide attribution as a creator’s default right.\nThe third and most important experiment reported here casts doubt on the value of giving creators such a default right, because creators value attribution differently depending on whether the legal rule gives it to them as an initial entitlement or not. When creators are given a right to attribution as a default they value credit four times higher than when attribution is not the default option. Our findings make clear that creators value attribution, and that the prospect of obtaining it can lead to a more efficient level of transacting. At the same time, and paradoxically, our findings also suggest that before we restructure American law, which provides no right to attribution for the vast majority of creators, we need to take care, because it is possible, under conditions that we will describe, that providing creators with a default right to attribution will result in less efficient transacting.\nFinally, our findings have important implications for property theory which are broader than IP law or attribution rights. Our third experiment suggests that a party who enjoys a default legal right as part of her initial complement of rights will tend to treat that legal right in a fashion similar to any other form of initial entitlement, and overvalue it relative to what neoclassical theory would predict. This suggests a principle regarding how to efficiently structure default rules in any setting. All other factors being equal, an efficiently-structured default rule will locate the initial legal entitlement in the party who is either less likely to overvalue the entitlement, or, if overvaluation seems inevitable regardless of where the initial entitlement is placed, is likely to overvalue it less.\nNumber of Pages in PDF File: 47\nKeywords: copyright, patent, attribution, publication, reputation, behavioral economics, moral rights, experiment\nDate posted: February 27, 2012 ; Last revised: January 2, 2015\n© 2016 Social Science Electronic Publishing, Inc.

Physical therapy is the field of medicine that is devoted to restoring and improving human movement. Physical therapists achieve correct posture and spinal alignment by reducing pain and using physical methods such as strength training, massage and using the body’s natural healing processes. Physical therapists are experts in movement, kinesiology (study of human movement) and functional independence. Physical therapists help people of all ages and skills to improve strength, restore mobility and reduce pain. Restoring mobility and pain-free movement is crucial to an individuals ability to participate and perform in recreational and work duties, as well as improving their quality of life and overall health. This leads to reduced risk of falls and reduced risk of stroke and heart attack1.\nIn many cases, physical therapy has been shown to be just as effective as surgery when treating a wide variety of conditions from low back pain, shoulder issues and knee arthritis2,3. How wonderful to be able to participate in several weeks of non-invasive therapy to get the same outcomes as an invasive, costly and risky surgery!\nUnfortunately, there are misconceptions about physical therapy that may discourage people from seeking the skilled guidance of a licensed therapist. Some misconceptions include: insurance coverage, physician involvement, preconceptions about pain, not understanding what physical therapists are capable of treating, clinical indications and therapists’ education.\nIn all 50 states of the U.S., a physical therapist can perform a physical therapy evaluation without a physician referral. By participating in a physical therapist evaluation, you will learn what physical limitations you have and how they relate to your pain or limited independence and how to correct them.\nPhysical therapy is typically a covered service by most insurance policies. For people that have Medicare, services are covered at 80% and the other 20% is covered by a supplemental policy if you have one. Other insurance policies may even cover physical therapy costs at 100% making it a very affordable alternative to costly surgeries3. Insurance companies recognize the significant value physical therapy holds in the medical field.\nPhysical therapy is not only for injuries or accidents. The skilled physical therapist is able to evaluate and diagnose potential issues before they lead to more serious injuries or falls. A physical therapist can improve the joint function in one joint to impact the functional performance of another. For example, if you are having pain in your back related to vertebral dysfunction, the therapist can improve the joint mechanics and muscle action of your low back, and further improve the joint mechanics of your hips and knees, reducing potential complications down the road. All treatments are specific to the individual needs and vary person to person with the ultimate goal of eliminating pain and restoring natural movement.\nPhysical therapist are capable of and license to treat numerous physical disabilities Including orthopedic conditions such as: pre- and post- joint surgery, chronic pain, knee injury including ACL and meniscus tear, joint sprain, arthritis, back pain related to disc herniation, vertebral fractures, spinal stenosis, osteoporosis, frozen shoulder, rotator cuff tear, hand injuries, bursitis, muscle strain, plantar fasciitis/foot pain and Neurologic conditions such as: stroke recovery, peripheral neuropathy, balance impairment, progressive neurologic conditions including Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, headaches, vertigo all utilizing our bodies own natural healing abilities.

49	What role do environmental health considerations play in both bicycle infrastructure and public landscape design, and how are these integrated into modern urban planning?	Environmental health considerations are integrated into both bicycle infrastructure and public landscape design through multiple approaches. In bicycle infrastructure, this is demonstrated by projects like Belgium's nature preserve bike trails that minimize environmental impact while promoting user engagement with nature, such as the 'Cycling through Water' path and the elevated forest canopy trail. For public landscapes, environmental health management includes crucial measures like elimination of harmful insects (bees, wasps, mosquitoes), monitoring and removing toxic plants, and implementing vermin-elimination programs. Both areas require regular monitoring of water quality, proper sanitation systems, and systematic maintenance procedures. Modern urban planning must balance these environmental health factors while creating functional spaces, as seen in projects like Copenhagen's redesigned transit plaza which incorporates both bike parking and clear sight lines for safety.	"['While some cities still struggle to build safe bike lanes, others are creating infrastructure like a multi-level bike parking garage and an aerial path that connects to transit stations. The Bicycle Architecture Biennale, opening in Amsterdam on Monday, highlights 15 of the most interesting projects. “By showcasing the most dynamic, visual solutions, the BAB inspires a new way of thinking about what cities of the future should look like,” says Adam Stones, strategy director of Bycs, an organization aiming to move 50% of urban trips to bikes by 2030. “And by showing what is possible, it will lead to many more creative solutions being implemented.”\nFour of the projects are from the bike-obsessed Netherlands. But Next Architects, a Dutch architecture firm that helped curate the show, points out that the country was dominated by cars in the 20th century, and had to make conscious choices to transform–meaning that other countries can do the same thing. “It is thanks to decades of campaigning against car architecture, against plans without bicycles, that the space for slow traffic and residence has been reclaimed in the city,” says Bart Reuser, founding partner at Next Architects.\nBiggest bicycle parking in the world\nEctor Hoogstad Architecten (Utrecht, the Netherlands)\nIn Utrecht, where around 43% of trips take place on bikes, a massive bike parking garage at the central train station now fits 12,500 bikes. The space is so large that it includes indoor bike ramps so that riders can quickly ride to park; a digital system is designed to guide people to empty spaces. (Along with other bike parking near the central station, there will be more than 33,000 spaces for bikes in the area before the end of 2020.)\nCycling and pedestrian connection\nBatlle i Roig (Barcelona, Spain)\nFor decades, it’s been difficult for people walking or biking to cross an intersection in Barcelona where a ring road meets an expressway. A new path is more direct, or about 1,640 feet shorter than the old route, and designed to feel more like riding in the countryside than the middle of the city.\nCoffee & Bikes\nBureauVanEig/Biq architecten (Delft, the Netherlands)\nOver the last couple of decades, the main road at the university campus of TU Delft has transformed from a street filled with cars to a green zone with walking and biking paths. In the center, a huge new bike parking garage has space for 2,100 bikes combined with a light-filled coffee bar. It also has a bike repair workshop.\nXiamen Bicycle Skyway\nDissing+Weitling (Xiamen, China)\nIn Xiamen, an aerial bike path travels for nearly five miles—the longest elevated bike path in the world—with 11 exits to public transit hubs and bike rental for people who are rushing to a nearby bus or subway station. At rush hour, more than 2,000 bikes an hour can fit on the path.\nCycling through water\nVisit Limburg, Lens°Ass Architecten (Limburg, Belgium)\nIn the middle of a Belgian nature preserve, a sunken bike trail cuts directly through a pond, so cyclists can ride at eye level with the water and glide by swans. The path, called Cycling through Water, helps inspire people to ride bikes; an average of 800 visitors a day now come through the area.\nCycling through the trees\nBuroLandschap (Limburg, Belgium)\nNearby, another new Belgian bike path rises as high as 32 feet into the canopy of a forest. The circular path was designed to have as little impact on the forest as possible during construction, while giving riders a new experience in nature. Like Cycling through Water, it’s intended as a draw to convince more people to ride bikes.\nCurtin Bike Hub\nConiglio Ainsworth Architects (Perth, Australia)\nAt a university in Perth, a bike hub has 200 parking spaces along with showers and locker rooms to make it easier for students and faculty to commute by bike.\nNelson St Cycleway\nMonk Mackenzie, LandLAB, GHD (Auckland, New Zealand)\nA former highway off-ramp in Auckland has been transformed into a bright pink bike path that connects to a cycle loop in the city center, providing a new way to cross a busy street. The walls of the path hold an interactive light sculpture.\nSchneider+Schumacher (Raunheim, Germany)\nA sleek, spiraling white bike and pedestrian path crosses a river past an oil terminal, closing a key gap in a longer path between the cities of Frankfurt and Mainz.\nUpside Down Bridge\nNooyoon (New York, USA)\nThis proposal for an abandoned rail line in the New York City borough of Queens suggests building a “upside down bridge” with a community center at the base, a “floating forest” at each end of the top, space for urban farming, and bike paths along the side.\nCOBE and Gottlieb Paludan Architects, Sweco (Copenhagen, Denmark)\nA huge plaza next to Denmark’s busiest transport station used to be chaotic. The space was redesigned to be easier to navigate, with slightly sunken areas for bike parking that give a clear line of sight across them. The site has space for 2,500 bikes.\nSPADE (Cologne, Germany)\nA proposed bridge in Cologne would link to two other major bridges, creating a new connection between the city’s halves without a new span across the Rhein River. The curving design will make it easier to walk or bike from the city center to other neighborhoods.\nPaper planes e.V. (Berlin, Germany)\nUnder an elevated metro line in Berlin, a proposed project would transform underused space into a new protected bike path that shelters riders from rain and snow. The project includes plans for beer gardens, food truck stops, and charging stations for electric bikes along the way.\nBike Parking Canopy\nNL Architects (The Hague, The Netherlands)\nAt a new hall at The Hague’s central station, an elevated tram track will pass through the hall. In this proposed project, bike parking will also be elevated inside the hall, making it visible and easy to access.\nNEXT Architects (Purmerend, The Netherlands)\nThis unique bridge separates bikes and pedestrians, with a high arch that offers views (and exercise, with steep stairs) for people on foot, and a low path for people on bikes and in wheelchairs. The bridge connects the city center with another district across the river.', 'Reduce public liability in landscape design and construction\nThe mitigation of liability is a critical concern in the design and construction of grounds and landscapes for public use. As our society becomes increasingly suit-conscious, critical and fatal personal injuries will add untold millions to the budgets of business and agencies. We can directly trace consumer, patron and user safety in public open spaces, commons and other assembly properties to the implementation of grounds-management policy and procedure, and to the personnel, supervisors and governing board or policy makers responsible for them.\nThe amount of money allocated to safety is an indication of the priority it has in an organization. However, to make the most of funds provided for safety, policy makers need to first examine the applications of safety in the care of grounds that the public uses. The safety of the public or patron includes the categories of health, security and well-being.\nHealth Patron health is relevant in a couple of ways. First, health is achieved through the prevention of disease or sickness through personal hygiene. Second, health is achieved through the prevention of disease or sickness with personnel/occupational and environmental controls. Both aspects of health are extremely important to the administration and operation of grounds and landscapes. Extensive literature is available on personnel health (though not specifically related to parks), but little literature is available on environmental health.\nPersonnel health as it relates to hygiene and sanitation is the responsibility of the administration and the maintenance staff. They must ensure that: * Potable water utilities have good water quality * Valves and backflow preventers are operable, preventing contamination from irrigation water * Disinfecting systems are operable in pools, shower rooms and waterfronts * Restrooms, water closets, sanitary systems, sewers, septic tanks and tile fields are clean and operable * Lavatory facilities receive periodic inspection and cleaning on a scheduled basis.\nManagement should review all other systems that affect hygiene or sanitation. Establish check lists and regularly inspect all garbage receptacles. Disinfect, wash down and repaint them, as well as storage bins and other equipment and facilities. Establish medical forms and symptom checklists to provide early detection of any communicable diseases that might be passed by oral or physical contact. An increasing problem in parks is feces accumulation from dogs, geese and ducks. To track this, establish a monitoring system to check bacterial levels of soils and water.\nEnvironmental health in parks involves the elimination of insects such as bees, wasps, mosquitoes and flies. These insects can disrupt and even cause extreme harm to park users. Monitor all park areas, spray insecticides when necessary and remove attractions to such insects. Some plants are dangerous because they are toxic or because of spines or thorns-affix warning labels to hazardous plants or simply remove them. Debris also is an environmental-health problem. Excessive accumulation of equipment, paper and other trash is an environmental hazard because it can encourage rodents and other animals that transmit disease or give serious bites. Therefore, establish a vermin-elimination program starting with cleaning up trash.\nSecurity You should consider two aspects of security. The first is protection from the anti-social behavior of others. Next comes protecting one\'s property from such anti-social behavior.\nIt is imperative that landscape designs incorporate features that reduce actual victimization and the fear of victimization. This implies not only to discouraging criminals by apprehension (the responsibility of police) but also the potential for victimization inherent in a landscape.\nStudy each public area to determine its vulnerability. This includes the following aspects: * Physical layout. Create flow diagrams that reflect how traffic flows, how unassigned, unused or unsupervised spaces can encourage undesirable elements and how other spaces can cause conflicts and congestion. * Architectural design. Look at the architectural scheme to determine how hidden areas, shrub and tree masses, gullies, rock outcrops and other areas offer concealment. * Entry-point controls. Learn where forced entry and intrusion onto the grounds is possible. Study areas that are concealed or uncontained and where barriers can reduce intrusions. * Lighting. Determine areas that are vulnerable to crime or where illumination is lacking. Looking at each of these factors helps you pinpoint ways you can contribute to a more secure environment.\nWell-being Well-being involves the mitigation of injury or property loss by accident and the mitigation of injury or property loss by crime. Both aspects are extremely important to the administration and operation of grounds involving the public. Little has been written in the field of grounds care involving consumer safety. Though awareness is increasing of the importance of governmental, institutional and other organizational groups in protecting themselves from litigious patrons, liability judgments are occurring more than ever before. This suggests that we are not implementing the simple precautions involved in protecting patron health, security and well-being as well as we could be.\nPublic safety deals with three types of factors. Safety exists to the extent that design, construction and maintenance focus on it. Safety must fit into the management system delivering the service, and it must be concerned with reducing hazards and dangers in both the physical property and its programs. Hazards and dangers don\'t always come from some external intruder intent on causing bodily harm or property damage. Mismanagement also can create conditions that result in bodily harm or property damage. Therefore, always make sure that your operational budget includes allocations for inspection and evaluation. Establish a detailed checklist or guidelines (see boxed information, at left) that can pinpoint specific hazards or dangers in public parks and other facilities.\nPresently, the Consumer Products Safety Commission is taking tremendous steps to overcome the hazards and dangers to consumers in many products, as well as the Occupational Health and Safety Administration to employees in the workplace. These two organizations can provide detailed information about mitigating site hazards.\nAnother aspect of internal problems in landscape design and construction relates to supervision of activities and whether personnel are screened and qualified. Businesses and agencies often organize events and activities for an inappropriate group, in an inadequate site, with unsafe equipment or with personnel that are untrained, insensitive, over- or under-reactive or just unconcerned. Such poorly conceived events not only can cause harm to the public consumer or user but even hostility among the public. The design and construction of a facility should promote maintenance efficiency that encourages a safe environment for patrons.\nHere\'s an example of how important it is to be vigilant about spotting potential hazards. Fencing was an important consideration in a recent jury verdict. A decision in favor of the plaintiff was costly to the defendant (a corporation). The plaintiff was injured when he scaled a 6-foot fence to retrieve a neighbor\'s child who had slipped between the fence\'s pickets-spaced 5.75 inches apart-and ran into a busy parking lot and driveway. Although the jury apportioned the plaintiff 40 percent of the negligence, it attached the following statement to the verdict:\n""Due to the fact that this case was based primarily on safety issues regarding all play areas, we the jury strongly recommend that ABC Corp. Inc. and/or its owner/operators modify all playground fencing to include narrowing the fence spacing to 4 inches or less or other adequate modifications that utilize current technologies....We also recommend that signage be placed on all fencing (not conforming to the above recommendations) that there is a danger to children of all ages passing through the fencing. We also recommend that ABC Corp. Inc....utilize community-service program[s] to make citizens aware of [the] dangers involved in playland/playplace fencing and [to] educate parents and children on playground safety. These recommendations have been made in lieu of larger monetary awards so that those monies may be used toward modifications of fencing.""\nThe plaintiff expressed enthusiasm that such a simple hazard-with such dangerous implications for injuries and fatalities-could easily be corrected. He indicated that the order obligated such corporations to expend the necessary funds to make public-use areas safer.\nThis example illustrates that the design and construction of publicly used grounds must comply with existing codes and standards-which includes 4-inch spacing between fence pickets.\nThe landscape profession\'s mission with regard to safety is to satisfy the health, security and well-being of the public through the reduction of manmade and natural hazards. The way for grounds-care professionals to address this obligation is to mitigate liability in every way. Fulfilling this obligation-to be responsible and not liable-depends on constant safety consciousness and awareness. Because professional landscapers, which enhance and construct the grounds and landscapes of all public-use environments, can become the targets of citizens eager to sue, the need for adequate landscape design and construction is for more than the sake of appearance.\nDr. Arthur H. Mittelstaedt Jr. is executive director of the Recreation Safety Institute (Ronkonkoma, N.Y.).\nIn the design and construction of landscapes, grounds and other public areas, consider possible unsafe situations and conditions arising from the following factors: * Placement of alcoves, entrances and columns * Location of closets and unused alcoves * Furnishings protruding from walls * Amount and intensity of lighting, both indoor and outside * Location of lighting fixtures * Location of walks in relation to walls, boulders, trees and other obstructions or concealments * Control-booth or control-office location (should have good visibility) * Location of signs, notices and other directions * Non-flush or non-recessed wall-mounted fixtures * Placement of detectors for smoke, heat, sound, movement or video * Location of exit doors * Location of locker and rest rooms * Number of entrances and exits * Visibility of restroom entries and exits * Alarms in private rooms such as lockers and restrooms * Number of outdoor-area lights * Accessibility of call boxes or alarms * Location of benches, monuments and other structures * Types of gates and locking devices * Placement of mats, docks, sensors and other detection devices * Width of paths used by emergency vehicles * Open surveillance potential of maintenance and storage areas * Surveillance devices such as sensors, lasers, TV and audio machines * Size and type of fencing.\nWant to use this article?

50	What are signs of hypersensitivity in SPD, and which proprioceptive activities help?	Hypersensitivity signs include extreme responses to loud noises, avoiding touch, and being distracted by background noises. To help with sensory regulation, proprioceptive activities like crawling exercises (wheelbarrow, army crawl), and extra weight exercises such as pushing heavy objects or wearing weighted vests for 20 minutes every hour can be beneficial.	['Telltale Signs of a Sensory Processing Disorder\nImagine this: You’re playing on the floor of your living room with your little one, and the sound of a leaf blower starts up outside. Everything is fine until your child hears the noise. Now the screaming tantrum begins, and there’s nothing you can do to stop it. A few minutes later, the leaf blower stops running and everything is back as it was.\nThis experience could be a coincidence, but for some young ones, instances like the one described above are a telltale sign of a sensory processing disorder (SPD). SPDs cause an inability to process sensory stimuli from the outside world. This means it is difficult to interpret information from one or more senses. When sensory signals are received by a person’s nervous system but aren’t interpreted normally, an extreme emotional and/or physical reaction can occur.\nSensory processing disorders can be divided into two categories:\nIn children with hypersensitivity, you may see extreme responses to unexpected or unordinary auditory, tactile or visual stimuli. Hyposensitivity is the term used to explain behavior responses that yield little or no reaction.\n- Extreme responses (vomiting, screaming, etc.) to sudden, loud noises like toilet flushing, clanking silverware, car horns etc.\n- Avoids touch/fearful of hugs\n- Distracted by background noises others don’t hear\n- Avoids standing close to others or being in large crowds\n- Constant need to touch others/things, even when not appropriate\n- Clumsy, uncoordinated\n- Slow response/indifference to pain\n- Seeks thrills, dangerous situations\nMany people affected by an SPD will experience one or the other; some show a combination of both.\nThere exists a wide range of sensory processing disorder symptoms, and these will vary by child. The most common symptoms infants experience are:\n- Difficulty eating\n- Problems falling asleep or staying asleep\n- Little interest in toys that require dexterity\n- Irritability when being dressed\n- Slow response time to pain\n- Resisting cuddling\n- Difficulty shifting focus from one object to another\n- Constantly moving\n- Delay in crawling/standing/walking/etc.\n- Inability to soothe with pacifier, voice of Mom or Dad, etc.\nFor preschool-aged children, the most common signs are slightly different:\n- Overly sensitive to stimulation (overreacts to touch, smell, sight, etc.)\n- Difficulty making friends\n- Problems being toilet trained\n- Trouble being understood in speech and understanding others’ verbal instructions\n- Unsure of how to move their body\n- Difficulty learning things that require fine motor skills\nAlthough many kids could face some of these issues some of the time, those with sensory disorders are so affected that normal, everyday functioning is impaired.\nIt is unclear just how common sensory processing disorders are, but we do know that SPDs aren’t rare. Being aware of your child’s behavior and its patterns will help to determine if you should reach out to your care provider for further guidance.\nThe list above is far from exhaustive and isn’t designed to diagnose a sensory processing disorder. If your child exhibits any of these symptoms or isn’t able to adjust to life at home or school, it’s important to speak to a professional about your concerns.', 'As mention in our sensory integration therapy post, the proprioceptive sense is often impaired for children with sensory processing disorders. The proprioceptive sense brings awareness to our body parts relative to one another. For instance, if you closed your eyes right now, you could still pat your right hand on your head. This is a simple task for people with intact proprioception. The proprioceptive system coordinates the appropriate muscles of the body in order to move without even looking. It monitors the amount of force needed for an activity as well. Some common signs of sensory processing disorders of the proprioceptive sense include:\n• Coloring with too much/ too little pressure\n• Crashing into furniture or others\n• Low tone or energy\n• Poor body awareness\n• Avoiding certain activities\n• Playing too aggressively with others\nProprioceptive input is sensory input to activate the joints and muscles to become more responsive. Proprioceptive input should be applied every 2 hours. It can improve muscle tone, coordination, and calming of the brain. Some of our favorite activities are listed below.\nCrawling exercises (do at least 5 minutes a day):\n• Wheelbarrow: hold your child’s legs as they walk with their hands.\n• Ready, set, go! Incorporate crawling into friendly races between you and your child.\n- Army crawl: lie on your belly and move by pushing your elbows on the floor.\n- Bear crawl: Crawl on all fours (hands and feet).\n• Set up an obstacle course for your child to crawl through using tunnels, pillow, blankets, and furniture.\n• Imitate different “crawling” animals such as dogs, cats, bears, etc.\n• Have your child lay on an exercise ball on their stomach. Firmly hold your child’s back, and rock them back and forth. Rock slowly and rhythmically until their hands touch then backwards until their feet touch. Have them push strong off the floor with hands or feet. Rock back and forth 20 times.\nExtra weight exercises\n• Pushing or pulling exercises with a heavy box or item. Incorporate chores such as pushing the garbage to the end of the driveway!\n• Lifting a heavy object above shoulder level. Be sure the weight is appropriate for your child and not too heavy.\n• Wearing a weighted vest or wrist and ankle weights.\nWear weighted vest for 20 minutes every hour.\n• Playing basketball with a weighted ball.\n• Hang from the monkey bars.\n• Climb walls, ladders, or ropes.\n• Play on the zip lines, seesaws, or trapeze swings.\n• Jumping on a trampoline or bouncy house. Keep it organized by counting to 100 or saying the ABC’s for every jump.\n• Jump rope\n• Draw squares with chalk outside then have your child jump with both feet from square to square.\nSensory input can help regulate and re-energize your child during the day. Take frequent breaks throughout the day and incorporate these activities. Learn more about sensory processing disorder here.

51	What are the installation considerations for vinyl horse fencing, and what factors should be evaluated when planning its placement in a property?	Regarding installation, vinyl fencing can be installed quickly with minimal tools, and the rails snap into vinyl posts making it easy to set up. For additional safety, it's recommended to protect vinyl fencing with one or two strands of electric tape. As for planning factors, gates should be strategically placed in corners closest to the direction of travel and should be large enough for equipment and multiple horses. It's important to avoid placing gates in low areas where water may pool, and the fence height should be approximately 5 feet for perimeter fences and 4.5 to 5 feet for dividing fences. When considering vinyl fencing, one should also evaluate both initial and long-term costs - while vinyl has a high initial cost, it requires only moderate maintenance and has an expected life of 20-30 years.

Much less installation time and labor, for small lots a full wire installation can be done in an hour or two"", ""Deciding on a fence is a major decision and investment for many horse owners. Factors horse owners should take into consideration are:\nPlanning. Design a pasture and paddock system that will centralize access to the barn, work, and feed storage areas. Also consider future expansion opportunities. Gates should be placed in corners closest to the direction of travel. Gates should be large enough to get equipment and several horses through at once. Avoid placing gates in low areas where water may pool. Sacrifice paddocks (paddocks where horse are held when no on pasture) can vary in size but should provide a minimum of 400 square feet per horse.\nBudget. A fence can be a major investment. In addition to the cost of materials, you have to consider the cost of maintenance. Some fences may have high initial cost but low maintenance cost. Conversely, some have lower initial cost but high maintenance cost. Owners should consider affordability both initially and in the long term and then choose the fence that offers the best features within an acceptable price range. Quoting fence prices can be difficult, however, Table 1 discusses different fences and cost and maintenance estimates.\nSafety. A properly installed and maintained fence should provide safety for both horses and people. There are several factors to consider in fence safety. First, a horse has limited eyesight. Therefore, a fence should be highly visible. Second, it must be solid enough to repel a running horse yet flexible enough to prevent injury. There should be no sharp edges (no barbed wire) or projections on the fence.\nInstallation. Another factor is whether you have the time and the expertise to save money by installing the fence yourself, or if you need to hire a professional contractor. Improperly installed fences will be less effective with higher maintenance costs.\nContainment. The priority of all fences is containment. Perimeter fences should be approximately 5 feet high while dividing fences should be 4 1/2 to 5 feet high.\nDurability. How long a fence lasts is a function of the type of material it is made of, the construction of the fence, the weather exposure it receives, the size and aggressiveness of horses contained, and how well the fence is maintained. Even good fences can fall into disrepair if problems are not identified and corrected in time. Check manufacturers recommendations, independent (i.e. University) product test results and if possible, other horse owners who are currently using the product.\nAppearance. The appearance of the fence should be the final consideration. An attractive and well maintained fence promotes pride in ownership, increases property value and gives an impression of professionalism. One approach would be to place more expensive, eye appealing fences in the well-traveled areas and less expensive fences in other areas. However, the more attractive fences must also be functional. Never let appearance alone lead you to choose a fence that doesn't meet your needs.\nTable 1.

52	what causes purple edges tree branches bright sky photography	This phenomenon is called Chromatic Aberration (CA) and occurs when the lens cannot bring all different light wavelengths together to reach the sensor correctly. It's a fairly common occurrence with many lenses, particularly noticeable when shooting trees against a bright grey sky, where purple fringing appears between the branches and the sky. While the fringing isn't always purple, this is the most common manifestation. It can occur with any lens but is most common with budget lenses, and zoom lenses often show the worst examples due to their complex design.	['You may have heard of this phenomenon in connection with shooting trees against a bright grey sky where the lens has caused a purple fringing between the branches and the sky. This is called Chromatic Aberration (CA) and it is unfortunately a fairly common occurrence with many lenses. The fringing isn’t always purple but this is the most common manifestation. It is occurs when the lens cannot bring all the different light wavelengths together to reach the sensor correctly.\nDepending on the severity of the CA, it may only become obvious when you zoom in to 100% or more. It can occur with any lens but probably mostly with budget lenses. If there are compromises in the design of a lens, then in certain conditions some CA will become apparent despite the price. Zoom lenses are often the worst examples due to their complex design.\nIf you have Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom or Camera Raw you may have already used the tools to fix this. In most cases, you simply choose the appropriate colour slider and the problem can be alleviated. Likewise certain camera manufacturers own software can cure it and indeed more and more ‘in camera’ processing automatically compensates for it.\nIf, having pointed this CA out, you find that some of your images now or in the future display it then the following should help you reduce its effects.\nCA is the sort of thing that can really make a printed photo look poor and competition judges will jump on it.\nIn Photoshop Elements you can quickly and easily remove CA.\nOpen the image\nStart a new Hue/Saturation adjustment layer as follows:\nfrom the menu pull downs\n– New Adjustment Layer\nGive the layer a name and click ok.\nNow you will have the Hue/Saturation dialog box come up.\nIt defaults to the Master Control, leave this alone.\nClick the pull down menu (Currently it says “Master”)\nSlide the Saturation control slowly to the Left and the purple fringe will begin to vanish. The amount needed is commonly in the range -60 to -90 but adjust it for your particular image needs.\nIf when you have carried out the suggestion above you now have a Cyan (greenish) fringe, try the following:.\nSelect the pull down menu again and select Cyan.\nAs before, drag the Saturation control slowly to the Left until the Cyan fringe has decreased.\nWhen you are satisfied that your changes are as far as you can go, click ok on the dialog box. Your CA has now been reduced as far as possible.\nIn Lightroom a similar colour adjusting process applies. Lightroom 5 and later versions are great at removing these colour fringes.\nThe first thing to do is open the image in the Develop Module.\nScroll down the right hand Panel list to find the Lens Corrections tab. Tick the box labelled “Remove Chromatic Aberration” and view the result.\nYou should find that it has made a difference but it sometimes it doesn’t fix the problem entirely. The cause may be because the CA is showing up in a strange blue colour and the Lightroom auto-fix settings tend to work better on green and purple fringing. What is needed are some other more precise colour adjustments to see if it can be eliminated it altogether.\nClick on the Colour tab under Lens Corrections and you will find Defringe options. You can run two defringe operations at a time, one based around purple, the other around green. You can widen your spectrum or move it around if your colour fringing doesn’t fall within those common colours.\nIf your CA is resembles an aqua blue, start on the Green Hue slider. Raise the amount about halfway then widen the Green Hue sliders until the blue fringe is gone.\nView your image at around at 100% magnification and check the brightest areas. You may notice some purple fringing.\nRaise the top Amount slider and it should make a change but widening out towards blue can eradicate it.\nIn the full version of Photoshop’s Camera RAW interface there are two sliders to help remove fringes. There are two sliders, Fix Red/Cyan Fringe and Fix Blue/Yellow Fringe. They work by rescaling the colour channels in the image. By using one or another or both, you can adjust them and the fringe will decrease or disappear.\nYou can experiment by first using the Fix Blue Fringe slider to reduce the blue and the the Fix Red/Cyan to reduce the rest.\nThe options in the Defringe drop-down menu (default is Off) are:\nAll Edges – de-saturate colour along any edge where there is a sudden change of colour. This can introduce some of its own fringes.\nHighlight Edges – defringe edges where there is a significant change in contrast.']	['<urn:uuid:bdd1e078-72eb-42c3-b98f-a62bfa8e72c3>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	9	90	797
53	How do modern waste management systems like composting toilets compare to traditional septic systems in terms of installation costs and environmental impact?	Composting toilets cost between $1,300-$6,000 for a family of four, which is less expensive than typical septic system installation. Environmentally, composting toilets are more resource-effective as they treat waste onsite, don't waste water for flushing, and eliminate harmful nutrient flows into rivers and oceans. Traditional septic systems, while effective when properly installed, require significant infrastructure including drain fields and proper clearance from groundwater tables, and can contaminate local groundwater if not functioning correctly.

The toilets—which don’t require water or sewage systems—also were used for isolated summer camps, poolsides, boats and cottages. Today, composting toilets are a fast-growing trend in green building; you can even buy one at Home Depot or Ace Hardware. In Austin, Texas, composting toilets have been approved for household use (though the city must approve each site). A recently constructed 30,000-square-foot office complex at the University of British Columbia was equipped with composting toilets so the building did not need to be connected to the sewer system.\nWhat is a composting toilet?\nComposting toilets are well-ventilated containers in which human waste can decompose under controlled aerobic conditions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Natural bacteria and fungi—and in some cases peat moss, sawdust or other organic matter—break down waste and toilet paper into humus, a fully decomposed, odorless waste that is 10 to 30 percent of its original volume.\nIn self-contained units (the most common type), compost decomposes in a chamber attached to the toilet. More complex “remote” or “central” units move waste to a composter in another location (such as the basement or outdoors) to decompose. Regardless of the type of composting toilet you choose, fully decomposed humus must be removed and disposed of once fully processed. Fully decomposed humus poses little risk to handlers and, depending on local laws, owners can remove bins of decomposed humus themselves and bury it as a soil amendment or have a septic hauler remove it.\nAdvances in composting toilets mean they require less homeowner maintenance. Some composting toilets use minimal electricity or battery power, which can come from solar power, to fully automate all or nearly all steps required for decomposition. Composting toilets with multiple composting bins eliminate exposure to unprocessed composting waste. While one bin receives waste, a separate bin processes waste. Such systems can easily accommodate an entire family.\nChoose your loo\nMultichamber batch systems\nCentralized, or multichamber batch systems, require less maintenance. They include two or more excrement bins; while one is in daily use, the other composts.\nPros: Each batch is able to cure fully without adding new excrement; these systems don’t require as much oversight as self-contained systems.\nCons: More expensive; some require users to add water to curing bin.\nSingle, self-contained systems\nThese simple systems, which require users to remove the humus from the bottom, are often used in small cottages or for camping purposes.\nPros: Urine keeps the process damp; simplest, cheapest option.\nCons: In single units, fresh waste is continually being added to partially decomposed waste. This means that some parts of the waste are more cured than others; uncured waste can have an odor and present health risks.\nLook for a toilet that conforms to the American National Standards Institute’s standard for composting toilets.\nEverything you need to know about composting toilets\nHow much do composting toilets cost?\nFor a year-round home, you can spend between $1,300 and $6,000 for a toilet that will serve a family of four. But keep in mind, you will save on water bills over the course of the toilet’s life (some offer lifetime warranties).\nWhere would I use a composting toilet?\nAny home can have a composting toilet. Composting toilets are an excellent solution for homes that aren’t connected to the sewage grid, or where connection to the septic system is expensive or difficult. You can also install a composting toilet as a second or emergency bathroom in an outbuilding or basement.\nDo I need a special permit?\nYou will need to comply with local building codes and regulations and get a permit. Call your city hall for details.\nCan I use the compost?\nProperly disposing of the final compost, or “humus,” is important. You can bury humus around trees and shrubs as a soil enhancement (never use humus on edible gardens) or have the compost removed to a treatment facility by a septic hauler.\nHow does a composting toilet work?\n■ A composting bin (or multiple bins for batch systems) is connected directly or via pipes to a specially designed toilet.\n■ Most composting toilets use no water. Micro-flush toilets use small amounts of water (about 4 cups per flush) and sometimes a battery or small amount of electricity to power vacuums.\n■ Batch designs without a vacuum flush rely on gravity, so the composting bin must be on the floor below the toilet. Vacuum flush toilets don’t require gravity, allowing more flexibility in bin location.\n■ An air inlet and exhaust system facilitate decomposition and release water vapor and other decomposition byproducts.\n■ Composting material must be turned; some toilets have automated aeration systems.\n■ For optimal composting, waste is heated with the sun or electricity.\n■ Some composters drain excess liquid (too much or too little disrupt decomposition).\n■ Final-stage humus is removed through a door.\nShould you get a composting toilet?\n■ It is more resource- and cost-effective to treat waste onsite.\n■ Water is not wasted as a transport medium to flush toilets.\n■ Harmful nutrient flows into rivers and oceans are eliminated.\n■ Humus is safer than any wastewater treatment plant or septic system.\n■ Batch system composting toilets are the most hygienic of all toilets if used properly; the natural bacteria that make compost kill viruses, bacteria and toxins in human waste.\n■ Many systems allow users to compost vegetable peelings and garden trimmings with toilet waste.\n■ Composting toilets require attention for proper maintenance.\n■ Pests and odor problems can occur if not maintained properly.\n■ Improperly maintained composting toilets are unsafe and unhygienic.\n■ Composting toilets are expensive compared with low-flow models; however, they are less expensive than a typical septic system installation.\nAnnie B.

54	How do Kansas and Michigan farmers address soil erosion differently?	In Kansas, farmers primarily focus on managing water erosion through practices like terraces, no-till farming, and winter cover crops to combat ephemeral gullies that form from rainfall runoff. Meanwhile, in southwest Michigan, farmers particularly emphasize wind erosion control, especially on droughty, coarse-textured soils. Michigan farmers have traditionally planted large acreages of cover crops, particularly winter cereals like rye and wheat, especially following early-harvested vegetables and seed corn. While both regions use cover crops, their implementation addresses different primary erosion concerns based on their local conditions and soil types.	['Researchers look for ways to slow runoff, soil erosion in farm fields\nReleased: Dec. 21, 2015\nMANHATTAN, Kan. – The same rain that helps farmers grow crops can also cause a few headaches as that water works its way from agricultural fields.\nResearchers at Kansas State University say they’re learning more about what causes ephemeral gullies – or tracts of land that are carved out when runoff pushes soil off of the farm field and into nearby waterways.\n“We have a lot more to learn, but we have developed models that can monitor water movement in a field as well as the detachment of soil particles, which leads to soil erosion,” said Aleksey Sheshukov, assistant professor of biological and agricultural engineering.\nLeft alone, gullies grow larger with each high intensity rain event. For farmers, it’s not just a scar on the field, but also a sign of losing money on land that is not farm-able.\n“Soil erosion is a big issue in Kansas,” Sheshukov said. “A significant percentage of the sediment that goes into waterways is due to soil erosion from gullies of nearby fields,” which can also cause destruction of streambanks and pollute water.\n“We are trying to learn about what causes ephemeral gullies and how to prevent them,” Sheshukov said. “We are beginning to assess those practices, but because of the differences in geography and soil and other factors, we haven’t developed complete strategies yet.”\nThus far, conservation practices on farm fields are designed to slow the push of water through the channel that is formed by the gully. Terraces, no-till farming and winter cover crops are some of the practices that farmers already are using. Sheshukov hopes to find more to help farmers in Kansas and beyond.\n“Reducing flow within the channel would help to minimize the power of the runoff, so we’re looking at creating obstacles and increasing vegetation in the gully to reduce the power of the flow,” he said.\nOther options may include making the sides of the gully less steep, double-cropping in the gully, or creating artificial swales. Regardless, Sheshukov said one practice won’t fit all situations because conditions in any given field vary by soil type, management, temperature, rainfall pattern and other factors.\nResearchers are certain, though, that fields with loose soils, a higher slope or larger drainage area are more susceptible to soil erosion.\n“In computer models, we can implement practices and get an average percentage of sediment load reduction,” Sheshukov said. “But the range of what will be the actual reduction all depends on individual fields and individual pasture.\n“Overall, there has been a lot more exposure recently to this problem, so I think we are gaining a better understanding of the issue. I hope in a few years we will be able to predict with more certainty the reduction rates for a given practice.”\nThe research project is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture; Natural Resources Conservation Service; Kansas Center for Agricultural Resources and the Environment; and Kansas Water Resources Institute. The project includes experts in agronomy, landscape architecture, agricultural economics and biological and agricultural engineering.\nK‑State Research and Extension is a short name for the Kansas State University Agricultural Experiment Station and Cooperative Extension Service, a program designed to generate and distribute useful knowledge for the well‑being of Kansans.

The afternoon of March 8, 2017, showed us without a doubt the value that vegetative covers can provide in reducing wind erosion soil losses.\nThe field in Photo 1 did not have a cover crop planted in the fall and had very little crop residue or vegetation to protect the soil from wind erosion.\nThe field in Photo 2 has a later planted cover crop (cereal rye). Even though there is not a lot of top growth in this field, the vegetative material that was there kept wind erosion losses to a minimum. Dust can be seen in the distance along a headland that did not have the cereal cover planted on it.\nSoil loss through wind erosion can be significant, especially on droughty, coarse-textured soils in southwest Michigan. The material that is often carried away from these fields is the finer soil particles. This important fraction often is made up of clay-sized particles. These particles, along with associated organic matter, provide a significant portion of the soil’s critical Cation Exchange Capacity. Nutrients such as potassium and phosphorus (P), are often tied to these particles. These nutrients may end up in adjacent fields, but also get deposited in surface water resources, where P can cause problems with aquatic weed growth.\nPhoto 1. This field did not have a cover crop planted in fall, leading to soil loss through wind erosion. Photos: Bruce MacKellar, MSU Extension.\nWhile the concept of using cover crops has once again become popular over the last few growing seasons, the fact is that southwest Michigan growers have routinely planted large acreages of cover on their operations for many years. This is particularly true in fields where vegetables and seed corn are produced. The earlier harvest windows for these crops allow producers to establish vegetative covers early enough in the season to allow these seedlings to grow.\nThe traditional cover crops grown in the region are winter cereals, with rye and wheat being the most popular. These covers are fairly easy to establish, can vigorously grow in relatively cool conditions and do an excellent job in reducing erosion.\nPhoto 2. The cereal rye in this field helped protect the soil from wind erosion. Note the dust in the distance along a headland that did not have cereal cover.\nThere is substantial research being conducted by Michigan State University Extension specialists Dean Baas, Erin Hill and Christy Sprague on the relative benefits of different cover crop species, or mixtures of species, that are available to plant and methods and timing of termination. There has also been a very enthusiastic cover crop promotion and establishment demonstration effort by the Van Buren County Conservation District’s Colleen Forestieri and her colleagues over the last several years, which has helped local growers explore adopting cover crops as part of their production systems. While there may be other benefits to establishing cover crops on your fields, one fact is abundantly clear: Cover crops are effective at reducing the impacts of wind erosion in high wind events on southwest Michigan soils.\nWant to learn more?

Stuart Cadge, from leading indoor mobile mapping specialist, GeoSLAM, explains how innovations in mobile mapping technology are paving the way for a new dawn in surveying.\nArchitects, project managers and surveyors are constantly under pressure to finish projects on time and within budget. Not surprising, considering that most contractors anticipate that up to 30% of their projects will be subject to costly delays. This issue is not limited to large-scale construction schemes, as similar constraints affect smaller building renovation projects too.\nBut creating a dynamic “digital twin” of a building’s features throughout a project’s lifecycle can help stakeholders remain up to date with a scheme’s progress, enable problems to be spotted early on, and speed up the decision-making process should alterations be required.\nOnce a 3D scan of an asset – whether complete or part-finished – has been conducted with a handheld, lightweight mobile mapping tool, project teams can generate highly detailed 3D models and 2D plans. These digital representations of a project can then be updated, re-scanned and interpreted at any stage in an asset’s lifecycle.\nNow, 3D mobile mapping technology has gone one step further. New mobile mapping tools use Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) technology, providing the ability to rapidly scan even difficult-to-reach places such as multi-level spaces, large multi-room hotels or enclosed basements.\nThe speed and non-evasive nature of mobile scanning also allows for the surveying of occupied premises, such as live construction sites, or in-use buildings surveyed for renovation or redevelopment.\nThe high ceilings in Turner Construction’s offices were problematic for traditional scanners\nThe model of the suspended ceiling voids\nConstruction projects routinely require a series of surveys and the subsequent creation of a model. One such recent example involves Turner Construction, the US-based global multinational construction services company which employs more than 5,200 people and completes 1,500 projects every year worth in the region of $10 bn.\nThe firm embarked on an extension project of its Atlanta, Georgia, office, and the latest mobile mapping tools offered a welcome alternative to traditional yet more cumbersome survey methods.\nBefore works were able to begin on site, the Turner Construction team needed to conduct a survey of the suspended ceiling voids. However, no previous 3D model of the space existed, and as a result, Turner was tasked with surveying the notoriously difficult space from scratch.\nDue to the building’s high ceilings and the limited space available in the void to manoeuvre equipment, traditional scanners would have struggled. However, thanks to the incorporation of SLAM technology, the Turner Construction team were able to put a GeoSLAM ZEB-REVO to use and complete a scan in just 10 minutes. Weighing just 1kg, the ZEB-REVO was deployed on an extendable pole into the ceiling void to capture scan data easily while overcoming the location’s relative inaccessibility.\nThe ZEB-REVO scanner completed the scan in a fraction of the time\nUnlike conventional methods of surveying, which can often take a great deal of time, the ZEB-REVO can be quickly and effortlessly moved without the need for time-consuming set-ups. It is also able to mitigate occlusions (object shadows), saving time on the overall modelling as the team already had a complete picture to work from – rather than having to interpolate between shadows that are usually seen in terrestrial scanning.\nIf traditional techniques had been used, it would have taken more than eight hours to complete the scan – 48 times longer than by using a ZEB-REVO. Added to that, surfaces had an average measurement accuracy to within two centimetres – more than sufficient for modelling the data in a BIM model.\nThe accuracy of the mobile data collected allowed for a full MEP layout to be built in just one working day, showing features all the way down to under four centimetres.\nTime and budget constraints will always pose challenges for those working on construction projects, regardless of their role or level of seniority. But, if the past few years have proven anything, it is those who choose to harness the latest digital technologies who will be rewarded with significant cost and time savings across the board.']	['<urn:uuid:eb50ae4b-1494-4ac3-b8d5-94b1f1074356>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	10	17	703
56	drug rehab success factors benefits outcomes cost treatment differences	Treatment outcomes depend on multiple factors including the extent of patient's problems, appropriateness of treatment, and quality of interaction with providers. While basic residential treatment costs can range from $2,000 to $20,000, successful completion leads to fewer legal problems, fewer relapses, and better relationships with family and friends. The treatment is particularly effective for those with severe addictions, unstable living situations, or limited family support.

Without the appropriate help, nevertheless, drug abuse could cause potential dangerous scenarios. In addition, substance abuse impacts not just the life of the private user however also the lives of his/her family. Thankfully, there are a range of effective therapy approaches to assist individuals overcome their medicine addictions.\nInning accordance with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), those who complete alcohol and drug abuse rehab are more probable to:\nHave less run-ins with the legislation.\nExperience less regressions.\nAppreciate better connections with family members, friends, as well as colleagues than those that do not take part in treatment.\nLots of persistent conditions such as joint inflammation or diabetes mellitus bring a danger of recurrence, even after years of effective clinical monitoring. In a similar means, there will constantly be an opportunity of regression for those in healing. A strong rehab program, nonetheless, gives people a head start with evidence-based treatment, and also fortifies recovering addicts against relapse. Selecting substance abuse rehab is a strong first step to assisting you or your enjoyed one get rid of a dependency and also lead a new, healthy and balanced life.\nBeyond the Detoxification process-\n– Recuperation Requires time to take care of the withdrawal signs.\nWhile detox is frequently looked upon as one of one of the most hard aspects of the recovery procedure, addicts aren’t in the clear once they make it through the detoxification process.\nThe genuine work of recuperation occurs post-detox in the restorative section of treatment. In treatment, both specific and also team, recuperating addicts discover the root causes behind their chemical abuse, aiding them to resolve these issues so they do not cause them to go back to chemical abuse at a later day.\nWhat Sorts of Alcohol as well as Substance abuse Rehabilitation Programs Exist?\nThere are numerous kinds of drug abuse rehab programs available. Various strategies provide a selection of aspects of care, while addressing numerous requirements. Personal substance abuse rehabilitation programs often give a large range of treatments for individuals dealing with a medication addiction problem.\nThere are 2 different sorts of domestic substance abuse recovery programs: hospitalized and also non-hospitalized. In the last few years, household treatment centers have gone through modifications and started to supply an atmosphere that is much less hospital-like for individuals. Therapies in domestic centers could depend upon the particular program and facility.\nOutpatient vs inpatient care options\nOutpatient medicine rehab programs are also offered, as well as they could vary in terms of intensity as well as length. The drawback to non-residential care is that people may typically still deal with everyday struggles that can cause drug misuse.\nThe primary step in the rehab procedure is usually intake or evaluation. During this phase, a professional team member will certainly deal with the patient to figure out the extent of his or her addiction and also devise a therapy strategy to assist them obtain the best chance for recuperation.\nThat Needs alcohol and also Drug Abuse Treatment?\nOne of the first concerns that ought to be asked when establishing whether you or somebody close to you requires medication abuse rehabilitation therapy is whether the problem of drug misuse is out of control. Individuals that are not able to manage their use of prescription drugs and/or immoral medicines might call for drug rehab services.\nLustrous or red eyes.\nWithdrawal from family members and/or close friends.\nState of mind swings.\nSudden adjustments in behavior.\nCareless in relation to individual grooming/hygiene.\nRunny or sniffly nose.\nChanges in resting patterns such as being up during the night and resting during the day.\nLack of rate of interest in favored tasks.\nJust what are the Conveniences of Longer Treatment for addictive behavior?\nVideo: addiction help in Hoffman\nNIDA advises that any kind of type of medicine dependency treatment last at the very least 90 days; as a matter of fact, they discover that shorter therapy lengths demonstrate minimal efficiency. While the initial investment of time can seem overwhelming, much longer therapy lengths settle.\nIn fact, the Substance Abuse and also Mental Wellness Services Administration (SAMHSA), reports that among those who remain sober for a minimum of 2 years post-rehab, nearly 90% are still sober 10 years post-rehab.\nSeveral medication abuse rehabilitation centers include durable aftercare programs, consisting of recurring private treatment sessions on a routine basis, team treatment meetings, as well as graduates occasions. Often, graduates are also motivated to get entailed in their very own recovery area by participating in 12-step meetings or staying in a sober living residence.\nWhat to Seek in a Therapy Program\nWhen choosing a drug abuse rehabilitation program, it is essential to understand what to try to find to select the best drug abuse rehab program for your or your enjoyed one’s requirements.\nFirst, think about whether the medicine recovery program accepts your insurance policy. If it does decline your insurance policy, discover whether it uses a payment plan.\nOn top of that, take the time to discover whether the rehab program uses services that encompass a wide spectrum of requirements, including emotional, medical, trade and also social. It is also vital to learn whether the program uses a selection of approaches, consisting of aftercare services, to help enhance the opportunities of long-lasting success.', 'Time can heal all wounds, the saying goes, and that wisdom certainly applies to addiction recovery as well. For people who address their addiction with the help of professional drug rehabilitation, there are plenty of options to choose from, and selecting one may seem like a never-ending challenge. But it doesn’t need to be if you think about what you really need to heal from substance abuse.\nThe residential treatment model is popular among people who need more time to address their illness and develop the skills needed to live without addictive substances.\nThink of residential rehab as the place where you get the time and space you need to address the psychological effects of an alcohol or drug addiction and learn new skills that can help you make the changes you need. You also have time to figure out how to rebuild your life from there.\nResidential rehabilitation, or residential rehab for short, offers clients services and activities in a residential setting that are all designed to support their recovery from drug or alcohol addiction. Clients live on-site at a facility that offers 24-hour monitoring and a setting that is free from outside distractions. Such a climate can help guide a client into earn to maintain a sober lifestyle. Addiction care and medical professionals are available 24 hours a day to help clients with their needs.\nPeople who have had a detox and must now choose which treatment program to enter may want to consider a residential rehab, especially if their addiction is severe.\nClients typically voluntarily enter a residential rehabilitation program; other clients may have to enter after a court order is issued. Programs of this kind are also offered for specific populations, such as adolescents, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, veterans, homeless individuals, people with severe mental health disorders, and people in the criminal justice system.\nResidential programs also are ideal for people who do not have a stable place to live, a job, or limited to no family support.\nHow long someone stays in residential treatment just depends on the person. How long clients stay in treatment depends on several factors, including:\nBefore it is determined that a residential setting is appropriate, an assessment, which takes place after the detoxification process, will review these factors and others such as medical history. The minimum required stay at a residential rehab is 30 days. Clients can stay even longer than a year, depending on the needs of the person who needs addiction care.\nAddiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disease, says the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). But, as the government agency notes, addiction is treatable.\nA long-term residential treatment model is recommended for people who have severe addictions to opiates/opioids (OxyContin, heroin), cocaine, methamphetamines, and alcohol among other drugs. People who have engaged in polysubstance use, when two more drugs are used at the same time, also may spend more time in residential rehab.\nResearch shows that at least 90 days or more are needed to treat a substance addiction. Long-term residential treatment increases the chances of achieving sobriety.\nAccording to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the most widely known long-term residential treatment model is the therapeutic community (TC), where clients can plan to stay between six and 12 months. In this arrangement, according to NIDA:\nThis kind of community also has a strong focus on helping to “resocialize” the individual and draws upon everyone, including the staff and other residents, to enhance the treatment experience.\nReady to get Help?\nWe’re here 24/7. Pick up the phone.\nYou can expect a range of inpatient services in an environment that promote long-term recovery.\nTreatment services offered at a residential treatment center often include:\nThis is typically the place people in recovery start the process of overcoming addiction. Medical detox is the first step to any successful addiction recovery. In many cases, withdrawal symptoms are often too difficult to handle without professional detox treatment.\nEducation helps clients understand what substance abuse and addiction are. It also raises awareness of the warning signs of addiction and information on how different addictive drugs and substances affect the mind and body, helping to prevent relapse in the future. Clients also learn about the effects addiction can have on one’s physical and mental health as well as their personal and professional relationships.\nPeople in active addiction and alcoholism often neglect their health and well-being. Nutrition is important to helping people regain physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.\nMuch of addressing addiction and substance abuse involves changing one’s thoughts and behaviors. Behavioral therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), helps clients address their negative thoughts and actions associated with addiction. With CBT, clients learn practical strategies and skills to change old habits or replace them altogether.\nAddiction affects more than just the person who is going through it. Rehab for couples helps relationships maintain stability through recovery from substance abuse, and it is effective when either one or both partners are recovering.\nRecovery from substance abuse often starts with personal accountability. Personalized treatment for clients can help them address emotional and social issues that contribute to their desire to use drugs and alcohol. This includes helping them see the problems they have and motivating them to change course.\nAs it’s often said, addiction is a family disease. Clients and their families can both work on recovery from substance abuse together. Family therapy can be the starting point to figuring out how to move forward and obtain healing that can benefit everyone in the family unit.\nClients who have a similar journey and experiences in common can provide invaluable support to each other. Group therapy sessions can ensure clients they don’t have to walk the path to recovery alone. They also provide opportunities for growth and support, including connecting with others and building friendships with people who abstain from drugs and alcohol.\nThis training can involve teaching clients job skills, social skills, communication skills, anger management, stress management, goal setting, and money management among others needed as clients learn or relearn how to be a part of society.\nClients who must take medications as directed by a physician or other medical professional can rest assured that they will receive what they need while they are in residential care. In many cases, medications are issued to help manage the physical symptoms of withdrawal or help clients abstain from substance use.\nClients can be reassured that centers, such as Pathway to Hope in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, continue to support clients after they leave their facilities. In residential treatment, there are alumni programs in place that are designed to help prevent relapse and ensure post-addiction treatment success.\nThe 12-step fellowships allow participants to reflect on their past experiences openly and honestly with growth being the goal.\nNIDA advises that long-term residential treatment can feel confrontational at times, possibly because of the intense focus on the client. As it notes, activities in the therapeutic community “Are designed to help residents examine damaging beliefs, self-concepts, and destructive patterns of behavior and adopt new, more harmonious and constructive ways to interact with others.”\nOther comprehensive support services, such as employment training, are offered on-site.\nResidential treatment is just one model for addiction recovery. There are others including intensive outpatient treatment and partial hospitalization. Residential treatment may be ideal in many situations, but some considerations must be made before committing to a program of this kind.\nOne is the cost. A longer stay in treatment means the costs will be higher. Costs can be affected by the severity of a person’s addiction, the goals they want to achieve, and the person’s response to treatment, among other things. Consider whether your insurance plan will cover these, and if so, which costs will be paid for.\nThere are reports that the basic level of residential treatment can run between $2,000 and $20,000. If it runs longer, such as during a two- or three-month span, costs could double, so keep that in mind when considering how much you can spend or cover with an insurance plan or another payment plan.\nThere is a strong correlation between the kind of treatment one receives and how long they receive it. Research suggests that residential treatment is the most effective form of addiction treatment.\nWhen considering residential treatment, think about the long-term and what goals you or your loved one wants to achieve while in a facility. Time spent in drug rehab or alcohol rehab is your special time to get focused on recovery and putting addiction behind you, so make the most of it and put effort into it. NIDA informs that along with stopping drug abuse, the main goal of treatment is to return individuals to productive functioning in the family unit, the workplace, and the community in which they live.\nThe outcome of substance abuse treatment; however, largely depends on the person. NIDA writes on the issue, “… Individual treatment outcomes depend on the extent and nature of the patient’s problems, the appropriateness of treatment and related services used to address those problems, and the quality of interaction between the patient and his or her treatment providers.”\nPathway to Hope, a Delphi Behavioral Health Group facility, specializes in helping people who are battling with substance addiction. We don’t just treat the substance addiction; we also treat the thought patterns and behaviors that can prompt individuals to abuse substances with effective treatments that focus on the roots of your addiction and mental health condition.\nFor detox and residential treatment, we will connect you with our sister facility, Arete Recovery. After that, you’ll come to Pathway to Hope for outpatient services. Don’t delay. If you need addiction treatment, now is a good time to seek it.\nNational Institute on Drug Abuse.

57	being model railroader need techniques weathering wood siding compare maintenance real wood siding	For weathering wood siding in model railroading, you can use techniques like dry brushing with light flesh color paint and applying watercolors (Chinese White, Lamp Black, Raw Umber, Raw Sienna, and Burnt Sienna) to simulate aging. In real wood siding, weathering occurs naturally and requires maintenance every few years through repainting or resealing to prevent issues like rot, moisture damage, and pest infestation.	['As I have added to the structures and rolling stock for my HOn3 Westcliff & Alton Railway Company, I find I’m using more and more styrene as a material of choice for kits and scratchbuilding. However, the prevalent prototype material I seem to model is wood. The character of the Westcliff & Alton I am trying to create, that of very well used and aged equipment and structures, is not the normal state of styrene as a material. With that in mind, I began to explore techniques to transform styrene into a reasonable representation of the material often associated with narrow gauge steam railroading, aged and weathered wood.\nWhy styrene? Several reasons. Styrene is easy to fabricate, that is, cut, shape, and bond. Parts assemble quickly. There are shapes and sheet stock to fit almost any need. The material is stable, doesn’t warp or shrink. It can depict other materials; steel, brick, concrete, and the subject of this article, wood. There are an abundance of styrene window and door castings, sich as Grandt Line parts. There is also a wide variety of kits, often inexpensive, representing both structures and rolling stock available to the modeler.\nIt is reasonably easy to depict a newly shopped and painted piece of rolling stock. But, what we want to do is take the material and represent what happens to the wood after a few years of exposure in the high country. My first step in the evolution of this process was a bit of weathering applied to this styrene IHC Old Time series water car. I purchased the car feeling it was unique bit of rolling stock and would fit nicely with the era and feel of the Westcliff & Alton. I also liked the pre-painted kit’s color, a slightly faded green, but it was just a bit too pristine. While studying the kit and thinking of ways to age it, I noticed that there was already a nice wood grain texture molded into the boards, but the texture was difficult to see. Thinking dry-brushing would bring out the texture.\nI looked through my paint box and found that a light flesh color I was using for painting figures, actually also looked like a raw wood. I began dry brushing and voila, the wood grain began to pop. I notched a few of the too-perfect boards at the end of the wood tank, added some bands, and had a very decent model that had been aged really quite easily and quickly.\nThis leads us to the two phases of the aging and weathering process: Phase 1, creating the wood grain texture, and Phase 2, painting to highlight and emphasize this texture.\nTo demonstrate, we will use the techniques on a kit, an Atlas Trackside Shanty (above), and to demonstrate the technique on styrene stock, a similar scratchbuilt shack. Finishing or painting the two shacks also demonstrates creating an un-painted wood finish and a weathered painted wood.\nCreating Wood Texture\nYou probably already have the necessary tools (above). For adding texture, you need a razor saw and a fiberglass/metal eraser. After a bit of discomfort, I would recommend using a metal bristle version such as the “Distresser” from MicroMark. The fiberglass bristles tend to break off and get into your fingertips. A bit of sand paper is used to clean up some of the fuzz created while adding the texture, and some files for shaping. A #11 hobby knife is used to shape and add texture.\nI’ve learned from this process styrene is a pretty robust material, so you can be aggressive in adding the texture. On the Atlas shed wall, drag the razor saw blade down the boards always running the long direction, or the wood grain direction of the board. You can make several passes and can really bear down. It’s hard to hurt this stuff. I also take the tip of the saw blade and use it to gouge a couple of deeper grain grooves into the boards. Do the same at the edge of the battens to better define them. Also, use this technique on styrene stock. Drag the blade down the styrene. Hold the styrene board or trim stock at one end and push the blade away from you. The trim I used on the shed’s door and window framing is scale 1″ x 4″.\nFor my scratchbuilt shed, and to demonstrate other texturing techniques, I used clapboard siding (above). After you have cut your wall from the styrene sheet stock, raise a few boards to depict those that have perhaps warped and /or become un-nailed or loose. To do this, slip the #11 blade into the styrene about the depth of a board and slice along a couple of scale feet (left). The blade will raise the board. At the end of your raised board, make a vertical slice. This creates the end of the board. Repeat this on a few randomly placed locations on your wall.\nTo further texture the wall and represent boards that may have rotted away, take the #11 blade and scoop out about an 18″ to 2′ length of board (below). Make this just one board deep (don’t do two or lap into a second board at the same location) and scoop down to make it level with the board below it. Repeat this in several locations also.\nNow take the razor saw and drag it horizontally, or the direction of the boards and wood grain. Again, you can be pretty aggressive here. You can’t seem to hurt styrene. After this step, take either the fiberglass eraser or the Distresser and scrub the siding to clean off a bit of the fuzz raised by the saw treatment. This also adds a bit of finer wood grain texture to the siding (Photo 7, below).\nYou can apply these same steps to door and widow castings. It may take some maneuvering to get to all the areas, but try to cover as much as you can with texture either from the saw treatment or the Distressing Brush. For the smaller or really hard-to-reach areas, you can use the tip of the #11 and carve individual grain grooves. Often these styrene castings, like the siding or strip stock, are too perfect, so I use the #11 and the files to put a few dings in the frame (left), roughing up the corners a bit to simulate where a cart might have nicked the corner or, in the case of the gondola, wear from loads being dropped or dragged over the top board (below).\nPaint and Weathering\nI treated the Atlas trackside shed to represent unpainted wood, while the scratchbuilt version is painted. The paints are shown below. To create the raw wood highlights, I use a light flesh or peachy tan color, such as Tamiya #81315 X15 Flat Flesh. A tan or beige won’t work, it is rather dull and the weathering will kill the highlight needed.\nFor the weathering I use rather inexpensive Cotman series watercolor from Winsor Newton. According to the Winsor Newton literature: “The range consists of 50 colors in tubes, which possess good transparency, excellent tinting strength and good working properties…” You can find these in art supply stores. The colors I use are: Chinese White #150, Lamp Black #337, Raw Umber #554, Raw Sienna #552, and Burnt Sienna #074. First though, I prime everything with Floquil Primer. With the news that Testors is dropping this line, you will have to find a substitute now. NOTE: Before you prime, always wash with water and a drop of detergent and let air dry. I use an old soft toothbrush as there may be more residue than usual to clean after the texturing process.\nAfter the primer has air dried (you can’t smell it), dry brush with the light flesh color for the “un-painted” wood. You will really see the texture beginning to come out (Photo 12, below). On the Atlas shed, there was a decal, so after the dry brushing now is the time to add signs or posters. Our “un-painted wood” walls are now ready for weathering which is done with the watercolor.\nWatercolor is a unique media, it doesn’t really paint or cover the surface, it is translucent, so the surface beneath shows through, acting almost as a stain, which is excellent for our purposes. Also, the watercolors will blend with each other on the wet surface, which again aids our purpose of subtly staining the wall. We in a sense are simulating nature, the water might be thought of as rain washing the soot and grime down the wall. Because, watercolor is a unique media, I recommend practicing with it to get a feel for how much color to use, how to blend, and the effects you can create. What you see while you are painting isn’t necessarily the end result. The good news is, if you don’t like it, you can wet it and make changes.\nI use a plastic lid from a coffee can as a palette and squeeze just a dab of the colors onto the lid. We don’t use much paint. Now wet the surface thoroughly (above). I use a #4 watercolor brush. Add a few drops of isopropyl alcohol to the water to help break the surface tension. You will probably want to work in small, about 3″ x 3″ areas, as the wall or surface will dry.\nNow wet a #1 brush and dab it lightly into the paint and apply it to the still wet wall. I usually pull a bit of the paint from the dab on the palette and mix it to a slightly thinned consistency, and then apply it to the wall (Photo 14, above). Start at the top and work your way down. Think of rain washing down a wall or across a surface. Add the colors at random and try to keep the colors fresh, in other words, don’t let them get muddy by all running together. Go very easy with the black. A little black goes a very long way, and tends to darken the wall too much, so use it sparingly.\nYou will notice areas beginning to develop a “nature” of their own, maybe a nice warm gold from the raw sienna, or a slightly darker area forming from the burnt umber. As these begin to evolve, I go back to them and add a bit more color, just to give that area a little boost or to enhance the color. As for the white, I will also go in and randomly place a few direct hits of white. That is a small dab of the paint placed on the tip of the brush then dabbed directly on the wall. These help break up the wall and represent salts or bleached spots on the wood.\nHere is the result of our “un-painted” wood wall (above). The watercolor technique for the painted wall is the same (below). For the painted surface of the wall though, I soften the paint from the bottle, with a drop of white, which helps create a sun-faded color. For the scratchbuilt shed, I used Floquil Reefer Yellow for the walls and Zinc Chromate Primer for the trim.\nThe Zinc Chromate comes out of the bottle pretty much looking like a faded Box Car Red. So using the same technique, dry brush the painted walls and trim with the light flesh paint to highlight the wood texture (below).\nAfter this dries, wet the surface with a #4 brush, and apply the watercolors. Again, black is strong so go easy with it. You can add water and thin it if you have too much as I did in on my first attempt. Always wash the paint down the wall or in the direction water would flow (Photo 18, below). If you begin to get too much water, take the edge of a paper towel and touch it to the water, and it will wick off.\nThat about wraps it up, using a bit of alchemy to yield aged weathered wood from styrene. Practice your technique, practice with watercolor, and take advantage of the head start styrene “wood” kits can give you for creating some very nice structures and rolling stock for your model railroad.\nOrder the 2013 HOn3 Annual today!', 'by Nick Gromicko, CMI®\nWood siding has been in use for a long time and is extremely popular. While newer, more modern materials have become very fashionable recently because of the benefits they provide in terms of weathering and damage resistance, wood siding is still commonly found on homes all over the world. InterNACHI inspectors will frequently come across this type of exterior cladding during inspections. Inspectors and homeowners alike can benefit from knowing more about the different kinds of wood siding, its advantages and disadvantages, and some signs that problems may be occurring.\nCommon Types of Wood Siding\n- clapboard. Also referred to as weatherboard, and bevel and lap siding, clapboard consists of long boards installed horizontally in such a way that they overlap. It’s typically made with cedar and redwood because of their strength and resistance to decay;\n- rectangular plank. This is similar to clapboard but it is installed vertically, as opposed to horizontally, and has a smooth look. Narrow strips of wood called battens are used to cover the joints and keep out moisture;\n- plywood. Yellow pine, Douglas fir and western red cedar are typically used in plywood siding. It can be installed vertically and horizontally, and it adds to the structural strength of a house;\n- shingles and shakes. Shingles are typically made of cedar, cypress and redwood and are machine-cut to uniform shapes. Shakes are similar to shingles but are hand-cut, so the sizes are not identical or necessarily uniform. Both types are applied from the bottom of a structure to the top, with each new layer overlapping the one below it;\n- solid wood or lumber. This is a very common form of siding made from solid pieces of wood that may be installed vertically, horizontally, diagonally, or in any combination. Solid wood siding is very durable and attractive, when properly maintained; and\n- hardboard. This is also sometimes called composition board. It is manufactured wood siding made of compressed wood fiberboard with synthetic adhesive, often pre-finished and treated with EPA-approved preservatives to help resist insect damage and decay. It is lightweight and less expensive than solid wood siding, and can be easier to work with because it lacks knotholes.\n- Wood is generally considered the most aesthetically desirable form of exterior cladding, and may increase the resale value of a home. A historic building with properly maintained wood siding in good condition is generally considered more valuable than a similar building whose siding is of a modern or synthetic material.\n- A large variety of styles and types of wood is available to suit different tastes.\n- Wood siding can be painted and stained virtually any color. Oil-based stain or paint is typically applied to the rough-sawn side, which will readily absorb the coating.\n- In many instances, wood siding can be repaired more easily than other forms of exterior cladding. A single damaged board of siding can usually be replaced and repainted.\n- Wood siding is generally considered the most environmentally friendly option, as opposed to other materials, such as brick veneer. According to Virginia’s Sustainable Forestry Initiative Program, brick veneer production requires 22 times the amount of energy needed to produce wood siding. Wood is also a renewable and biodegradable resource.\n- Although wood siding may be easier to repair than other materials, it requires more maintenance in general, and repainting or resealing must be done every few years.\n- Unlike siding made from synthetic materials, when not properly maintained, wood is susceptible to rot, which can lead to structural issues if not addressed in a timely manner.\n- While termite problems can occur with other materials, wood siding is more susceptible to direct attack from wood-destroying pests. The use of treatments and preservatives, as well as the choice of wood, can help prevent termite problems.\n- The cost of installing wood siding can be prohibitive, as it is one of the most expensive types of exterior cladding. The average price for a 1,250-square-foot installation may range from $6,500 to $7,500.\nA visual inspection of the siding includes reporting on its general condition. Defects may include damage, cupping, curling, cracking, splitting, and other problems that could affect the performance and lifespan of the siding.\n- Improperly applied paint is a common problem, which can cause blistering, peeling, cracking and fading.\n- Paint problems can also be caused by interior moisture passing through the wall and lifting the paint.\n- Chalking of the paint can occur over time. It can gradually break down to the point that it will lift off as a powdery substance when touched. This indicates that repainting is necessary.\n- Oil-based stain can deteriorate over time due to exposure to UV rays, excess moisture, or physical damage, or it may not have been properly applied in the first place. Stain may need to be touched up or re-applied.\n- Vegetation that holds moisture or water up against the siding, such as vines and ivy, can be detrimental to the condition of the siding over time, and eventually lead to water or moisture damage.\n- Natural wood siding should always be installed over building paper or housewrap in order to provide adequate protection from water intrusion.\n- Depending on the type of siding installed, the nails may be exposed or hidden. Proper use and installation of the correct nails is very important with wood siding. Generally, siding and box nails are used for face nailing. Casing nails are used for blind nailing. Nails should be corrosion-resistant. Nails should also be rust-proof to avoid discoloration. Stainless steel nails are the best choice.\n- Buckling and cracking can be a concern, especially with hardboard siding. The boards or planks should be attached with enough room left for natural expansion and contraction of the wood, which occurs across the grain.\n- If the moisture content of the wood siding is too high and external temperatures are right, rotting will ensue.\n- Water penetrating a wall often comes from poor building practices around windows and doors, as well as wall attachments, such as light fixtures. Outside corners are often subject to rotting due to imperfections at the corner joints. A moisture meter is also a useful tool for examining any suspicious conditions observed. Sources of moisture that can lead to rotting include:\n- roof leaks;\n- gutter leaks;\n- openings or gaps in joints;\n- condensation; and\n- wood installed close to or below grade.\nWood siding in its different forms is a common exterior cladding material that inspectors will encounter frequently. InterNACHI inspectors can benefit from knowing more about the different types used, as well as some typical problems associated with it.']	['<urn:uuid:6ba786fa-c322-4041-90ca-fb594f8d2ef9>', '<urn:uuid:c8be9a12-4618-4585-8aea-a457ebcf1db4>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	13	63	3167

Usage examples...', 'CMYK vs Spot Colors: How to Choose?\nMany times a day new customers ask us, what is a spot color? Or what is better CMYK or spot colors?\nA spot color, or aka, Pantone color is a proprietary color space used in various industries in America and Europe, but mostly in graphic design, printing, and manufacturing. Another word for pantone color is pms, which means the \'pantone matching system\'.\nIn custom label printing it’s common for label printers to use pantone colors to ensure accuracy across all their product labels and tag printing. Custom Labels and stock labels can both be printed in pantone colors. But this is really determined by the customer’s request, or artwork design.\nPrivate labels can use a combination of cmyk and spot colors, for example the label graphics can be printed in four color process but the business logo might be printed in 2 spot colors. Remember that when looking at online labels that spot colors are not 100% accurate due to the limitations of an LCD computer screen. It is always best practice to pick colors from an official pantone book.\nPantone Colors, Book, & Color Finder\nThese colors are usually very vibrant, and typically cannot be made with CMYK.\nYou can use the pantone color finder on the official website to view all color choices. Cust\nIf printing large volumes of labels and wholesale stickers you want to make sure that the color is the same on all the labels.\nPrinting labels and packaging with pantone colors ensures that even if all the printing is done with different printers, the result and shade of color will be the same. This way all your labels and packaging matches to be the same colors.\nMany Seafood labels that we print use the pantone system so that they assure all their colors are the same, even if it was printed three months ago. This way customers in the store don’t even need to look at the seafood label, they just choose the same color label and design that they purchased last time.\nProduct labeling has become more important than ever. Consumer packaged goods and manufacturers have learned that a high-quality product label can help market and sell the merchandise.\nA new trend has been smart labels, which can help extend interactions with a customer, even AFTER the point of sale. This label trend has become popular with many wine labels. Where the wine manufacturer can show the customer a video about how they make their wine, and where. All done by the customer simply scanning the label with their camera phone. The rest is automatic.\nCMYK or Pantone Artwork?\nDepending on how your artwork was created, it could be designed in CMYK, or it could be designed in pantone.\nIf you didn’t tell your artist to design in pantone colors, they most likely designed your artwork in CMYK. This can become a problem if you want to print in pantone colors. Because this means your artwork will need to be modified. Sometimes this can be a quick fix, sometimes this can take hours, or days if you have many different versions, and intricate artwork.\nLabel Color Consistency\nUsing Pantone colors ensures all your products and inventory is consistent with the same color.\nEvery year there are more pantone colors released, but right now as of 2019 there are only 1,114 pantone colors.\nPantone color of the year 2019\nSince the year 2000, The Pantone company started declaring ‘Color of the year”. The pantone color of the year in 2019 was ‘Living Coral’.\nThe press release declaring Honeysuckle as the color of 2011 said ""In times of stress, we need something to lift our spirits. Honeysuckle is a captivating, stimulating color that gets the adrenaline going – perfect to ward off the blues.""\nBelow is an example of an apple printed in Spot colors: With ‘red 185’ and ‘green 356’ being the main spot colors. Black is just default black.\nColor 1= Black\nColor 2 = Spot color Red\nColor 3 = Spot color Green\nBelow is an example of an apple printed in CMYK.\nColor 1 = (K) Black\nColor 2 = Magenta\nColor 3 = Yellow\nColor 4 = Blue\nThese 4 colors make CMYK.\nMost of the worlds colors and graphics are printed with CMYK, which uses cyan, magenta, yellow and black to make all the colors on the material.\nSpot Color Printing Example\nFor example, Coca-Cola uses a Pantone Red called ‘Coke Red’ for their logo and company color. This is the name the beverage company calls their color. This is not an official pantone color, because it is a custom mix. The closest default color to this might be pantone 185.\nHow Many Pantone Colors Are there?\nMost pantone numbers are labeled 1 to 1,114. But there are also many custom mixes that can be made for in between colors. For example the Coke-Cola logo above is a special red mix.\nChick Fil a also uses a red pantone color, but they use a standard pantone color red 186.\nWhat is the difference between 185 and 186? Well, both are red but have different shades.\nOn the left is 185, on the right is 186.\nRemember that pantone colors are not always 100% accurate on the computer screen, so it is best to choose the colors from a real Pantone Book the first time before you print.\nThis is because computer screens use the RGB color model, red, green, and blue to create the various colors.\nMost label printers will print labels in CMYK by default unless you or your artwork is asking for spot colors.\nFind a pantone color you like here on the official website, many label printers will choose a 3 digit pantone color for you by default, because the 4 digit colors are a little more expensive. Just a tip to keep in mind if you want to reduce printing costs.\nBut the truth is that at the end of the day, color perception is something very complex, and according to a recent John Hopkins Study on Color in 2015 there is still lots about color perception that we don’t understand. The conclusion of the study? Although our brain can distinguish between millions of colors, our brain will generalize and remember the ‘best’ version of a limited set of basic colors.

59	Are there any creative ways parking garages help people find their way?	Yes, parking garages use creative approaches for wayfinding. For example, the Phoenix Biomedical Campus parking garage uses bold colors combined with miniature car cutouts to accent level signage. Similarly, the Old Town Newhall parking structure incorporates signage that matches the look and feel of the surrounding arts and entertainment district, making the garage feel like part of the destination.	['Far too often, we think of parking as nothing more than a necessary stop on the way from our origin to our destination – not part of the destination itself. However, parking can provide a number of unique opportunities to make an impression that goes above and beyond the expected. Since parking is often the first and last impression a person has at a destination, ensuring that impression is a positive one can have a significant impact on customer satisfaction. Let’s explore some of the ways parking can surprise, delight and elevate in unexpected ways.\n1. Find Your Way\nForemost on anyone’s mind once they find a parking space is getting where they’re trying to go, making clear and accurate signage a critical piece of enhancing the user experience. In the Phoenix Biomedical Campus parking garage, signage goes above and beyond helping users simply find their way.\nBold colors that serve as wayfinding devices are combined with miniature car cutouts to accent level signage throughout the structure. These creative accents go a long way towards making the user feel welcome.\nThe city of Santa Clarita took a similar approach in the Old Town Newhall parking structure. As the structure was part of an overall plan to revitalize a dynamic arts and entertainment district, signage in the structure takes on the look and feel of signage used throughout the district.\nBy extending that identity into the parking structure, it becomes part of the destination rather than a disconnected piece.\n2. Turn It Up\nWhile we expect visual cues from parking structures, from signage and parking guidance to art and architecture, it’s not often that parking engages users through sound. However that’s exactly what you’ll find when you visit Stanford University Medical Center. Pedestrians entering and exiting Parking Garage #4 pass through an elevator and stair tower that provides access to the subterranean structure. As they enter the glass-windowed building, they might hear something unexpected: the ping of a tennis ball. The churn of a locomotive. The song of a bird.\nWhat do these sounds have in common? They are all connected to images etched onto the glass panels, creating a playful and wholly unexpected interaction between the building and the visitor. Given the stress that often accompanies trips to hospitals and medical centers, this encounter provides a unique opportunity to spark a smile where you might least expect it.\n3. Delve into the Details\nParking structures can provide an unexpected opportunity to express identity, be it an urban downtown, a mixed-use destination or a corporate campus. Not many have taken advantage of this idea more than the city of Santa Barbara. As a central downtown location, the Granada Garage is a reflection of the Mission Revival style architecture found throughout the area.\nThe treasure trove of details found within the structure include scalloped parapets, metal spires, terra cotta vases and plantar scones. The balconies over the main entrance feature wrought iron, as does a wide array of custom signage, including a sign for the Bike Station that appears to be suspended from a pomegranate. Taking time to explore the facility is rewarded with finds such as the Summer Solstice Celebration murals, which can be found on a paseo behind the structure.\nIn addition to design details, the Granada Garage also houses a unique opportunity to showcase Santa Barbara’s commitment to sustainability. A robust bicycle facility for commuters, including bike racks, tools and work bench to make repairs, shower, restroom and lockers, encourages users to bike to work.\n4. Enjoy the View\nHave you ever watched a fireworks show from the top of a parking garage? Spotted a scenic vista that you might have otherwise missed? Parking structures frequently offer unique views of the surrounding area. The San Diego International Airport had just such an opportunity with the Terminal 2 Parking Plaza. Located right on the harbor, the top deck of the facility includes a viewing platform that encourages travelers to stop and live in the moment before moving on to their next destination.\nAt UC Santa Cruz, parking is carefully blended into the surrounding Redwoods. Careful consideration was taken in the design of the foundation to not interfere with adjacent trees, preserving the stunning landscape. A combination of open and closed rails around the façade showcase the spectacular environment for all to see. Cantilevered parking stalls make it feel like the user is parking right there in the tree canopy.\nCreating moments of unexpected delight in a parking structure can range from elaborate design elements to simple and cost effective accents that can be added to new or existing facilities. The key is thinking outside of the box and looking for opportunities where we aren’t used to finding them. Big or small, they can go a long way towards forging a connection with the user and creating a positive impression.']	['<urn:uuid:8298e767-d853-4b08-906e-3be2fcb677d5>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	12	59	809
60	help poor chocolate farmers increase income	Several initiatives are being implemented to support cocoa farmers' income improvement. Companies like ECOM have developed a financial model for farm rehabilitation where they manage farm activities for three years while farmers learn new techniques and diversify income with cash crops. The model involves replanting old cocoa trees and integrating maize and plantain cultivation to ensure food security during transition periods. Additionally, there's the Living Income Differential (LID) scheme where manufacturers pay a premium of $400 per tonne of cocoa to address income gaps. However, scaling these support programs remains challenging, particularly for poorer farmers who don't have multiple plots or those with insecure land tenure. The initiatives also include training in financial literacy, agricultural practices, and alternative income-generating activities to help raise household incomes.	['Focus: Cargill drives momentum with ongoing cocoa sustainability schemes\nJAOBESO GHANA AFRICA\nEthical sourcing of cocoa remains a core issue for the sector, with manufacturers including Cargill, a sponsor of this year’s World Confectionery Conference, revealing its ongoing initiatives. Editor Neill Barston speaks to Kate Clancy (below), company sustainability manager, on tackling child labour, and supporting key producing communities\nAs the results of a major study from Cargill recently found, a total of 70% of consumers in Europe are now actively factoring sustainability into their product choices, including chocolate. The survey of more than 7,000 people highlighted the fact that people are now more alive than ever to the realities of the significant inequalities that are a reality for those working at the sharp end of the industry supplying the global confectionery sector.\nNotably, the company highlighted that ranges with strong sustainability credentials have taken on an increased importance, especially those businesses that are willing to invest in environmental or social initiatives that consumers can readily relate to.\nThe issue of engaging with consumers has become ever-more under the spotlight, and the survey in 10 European countries, found an even higher general response to chocolate products – with nearly three quarters of people reporting they prefer to buy sustainable products. This pattern was particularly the case with the 18-34 year-old age bracket, with younger consumers seen as being the most in tune with environmental issues. “Consumer expectations are higher now than ever before,” said Niels Boetje, managing director Cocoa at Cargill.\n“Our research suggests that increasingly, consumers look for responsibly sourced brands, backed by concrete claims and compelling stories that connect the products they purchase with tangible progress on critical issues like child protection and deforestation elimination.”\nSignificantly, among younger consumers, 76 per cent acknowledged sustainability has become more important to them in the past year when choosing chocolate products, with just over half of these Gen Z and millennial shoppers reporting a corresponding uptick in sustainable product purchases.\nWithin chocolate, consumers’ affinity for products perceived as sustainable was even more apparent. As the company highlighted, flavour and price of ranges also remain dominant factors, those who responded to its survey in fact ranked environmental and social sustainability on par with factors like nutritional value, brand name and previous product trial.\nSpeaking exclusively to Confectionery Production, Kate Clancy, sustainability manager at Cargill, explained that the company’s longstanding commitment to support cocoa growing communities has made encouraging progress – See our exclusive, extended video interview with her on the company’s key progress here.\nEncouraged by the results of its study into consumers preferences, she explained that it had underlined the value of its work within key producing regions. She said: “The consumer study that our teams undertook is significant, as it reminds us that there’s a willingness and an interest from customers in sustainability – they can involve themselves by supporting sustainable solutions within the value chain.\n“As a company, we produce a portfolio called Promise Solutions, which we offer to all sizes of customer across regions for them to purchase sustainable products, or get involved with sustainability project work through additional investment, and by doing that, they can understand the standards and conditions under which their cocoa is produced and its provenance,” explained Clancy, who recently spoke at the World Cocoa Foundation annual partnership meeting, where she noted the urgent need for combined work across the industry on delivering overall sustainability goals being targeted by the industry.\nSignificantly, she revealed that one of the most effective recent developments in relation to this has been the unveiling of its CocoaWise online portal.\nAs she added, this has been designed to further aid transparency of its sustainability work, as well as help build a lasting connection between farmers and consumers. This is achieved through real-time data revealing the locations of its farms across Ivory Coast, Ghana and Cameroon, which is supplemented with its beantracker, physically tracking each individual farm’s cocoa beans. Crucially, the latter measure has been put in place to ensure that beans from deforested areas do not enter the production chain – which remains a critical issue.\nFurthermore, the company is also among the original signatories of the Cocoa and Forests Initiative (CFI), which has been agreed between major confectionery manufacturers, civil groups and the region’s governments, designed to further ensure the end deforestation. This remains a crucial issue, with sector reports highlighting that in the Ivory Coast has lost up to 80 per cent of its core forests over the past five decades, with cocoa being one of the main culprits.\nAnother major matter addressed at the recent World Cocoa Foundation meeting was the recent US-based report from NORC at the University of Chicago into child labour within Ivory Coast and Ghana. Its troubling findings revealed that there were still major challenges on eradicating the problem – with a total of 1.56 million youngsters found to still be exposed to hazardous child labour practices in the region.\nAs Clancy enthused, Cargill continues to make headway on this as an integral part of its operations, working alongside global humanitarian organisation, CARE. According to their last joint report, between 2008-2018, their combined efforts had help reach more than 418,000 people, and 1,786,000 indirectly, through a host of programmes covering agriculture, economic empowerment, education, as well as water sanitation and hygiene initiatives, as well as working on child labour.\nShe noted: “We don’t tolerate child labour within our supply chain, and it’s something we have been working on for a number of years. I don’t think the sector fully appreciated some of the complexities in tackling in such an issue. “Cocoa is being produced in less developed countries, by smallholder farmers on a couple of hectares of land, their farming practices are not particularly modernised. There are not necessarily a lot of opportunities to generate additional income, and so what we realised some of the factors creating risk of child labour are surrounding poverty.\n“We’re about to release our latest decade of impact report with our partner CARE, which we look at a lot of prevention measures. One of the ways that you can reduce child labour is through education, and actually ensuring the environment is there for them – that there is a school, teachers and books for them, and that they’re enrolled,” enthuses the sustainability specialist. She notes that one of the main indicators of children being at risk from experiencing being in child labour was the absence of formally being registered at their nearest school.\nAs well as addressing conditions for children, the company has also placed significant emphasis on providing support for women in cocoa growing communities.\nAccording to Clancy, this approach is also having a positive impact on preventing poverty through helping raise household incomes, and specifically supporting women in communities.\n“Research we did with CARE a few years ago showed that Women spend most of their money on family education and nutrition and children, so if you can get more money into the hands of women, that will also impact on the risk factors for children,” she adds, revealing the company has also recently begun a scheme directed towards women which is focusing upon providing training on skills such as financial literacy, through to support on specific agricultural practices.\nNotably, she explains that such initiatives, which also include opportunities for training on other work sectors including crafts-based potential employment, can prove effective if linked to wider engagement with small and medium-sized enterprises in the community, as well as working closely with governments to ensure any such programmes are joined-up in their delivery.\nEncouragingly, she appears notably optimistic that the core areas of focus that the business is making on sustainability, alongside other major manufacturers, and civil organisations, is making a difference to communities in its supply chains.\n“Over the past few years, the sector has been very successful at implementing child labour remediation schemes, aiming at using data to target interventions, surveying farmers that observes them rather than taking a punitive approach in order to understand why child labour is happening,” she said represented a notable shift in how the issue is being addressed in the wider community context.\nAs she reveals, the information which is gathered in such exercises is then taken to deliver specific targeted interventions, which she describes as ‘powerful tools’ used by the industry.\nSignificantly, she cites the company’s own roadmap scheme that aims to have its entire cocoa supply chain covered by such remediation frameworks by 2025 in order to drive further impact on the issue.\n“I have a lot of confidence in the progress that we will be making, just given how rapidly we have introduced these new models, and how much willingness there within the sector to share learning and data to help us understand how we can scale these systems and to make sure they are efficient,” she adds of the company’s approach.\nAs previously reported, another major matter to have hit the spotlight for sustainability within the cocoa sector has been the emergence of the Living Income Differential (LID).\nUnder the newly-established scheme forged by Ghana and Ivory Coast governments, confectionery manufacturers pay a premium of $400 a tonne of cocoa supplies, which it is hoped will address the considerable income gap – which was recently put at $10 billion in a study from Mondelez International.\nClancy concluded that price is just one element of the problem, though affirms the company’s commitment to the LID payments, alongside a strategy of encouraging agricultural diversity and working closely with governments in Ivory Coast and Ghana.\nThrough such a combination of actions, she adds that there’s genuine optimism for continuing the strong progress made so far in the ongoing quest for supply sustainability.', 'Worldwide, forests are being lost at an alarming rate, driven by the expansion of internationally traded commodities. In response, companies are making efforts to reduce and eliminate deforestation from their supply chains. In 2016, Hershey’s and Ecom Agroindustrial Corp (ECOM) began collaborating with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Tenure and Global Climate Change (TGCC) Program that helped leverage private sector funding to address land and tree tenure constraints that inhibit cocoa productivity and contribute to deforestation around smallholder cocoa farming in Ghana. This work resulted in an assessment and recommendations for a future pilot, captured in the report Land and Natural Resource Governance and Tenure for Enabling Sustainable Cocoa Cultivation in Ghana. Over the 11-month period from February to December 2017, USAID implemented a pilot in Nyame Nnae, a cocoa farming community in the Asankrangwa district of Ghana with implementing partners Tetra Tech and Winrock International. The pilot had four specific objectives:\n- Increase tenure security of smallholder cocoa farmers through clarifying and documenting the rights of landholders and tenants that discourage removing old cocoa trees under stranger tenancy (abunu) contracts.\n- Promote the increase in carbon stocks in cocoa farms over the long term by explaining new Forestry Commission policy on tree tenure and documenting tenants’ and landlords’ beneficial interests in shade trees.\n- Replant old, unproductive cocoa farms to increase productivity over the next five to 10 years. This requires developing a financing model to replant old cocoa farms and provide extension services to farmers.\n- Develop lessons and recommendations for the Government of Ghana, Ghana’s Cocoa Forest REDD+ Program, the World Cocoa Foundation, Tropical Forest Alliance (TFA) 2020 partners, and others working on related topics with smallholder farmers that will allow the pilot to be replicated and scaled up over time.\nIMPACTS – LAND TENURE\nThe pilot focused on improving tenure in Nyame Nnae community in the Western Region. Nyame Nnae was chosen to carry out a tenure intervention based on community interest and factors like a high proportion of non-indigene farmers and a clear land constraint. There are three main customary interests in land in Nyame Nnae: customary freehold (9 percent), asideε (migrant farmer freehold – 45 percent), and abunu (46 percent). The project captured and documented land and tree rights as practiced; it did not try to convert these customary rights into statutory rights. The project engaged legal consultants to draft three customary land rights templates based on these prevailing customary norms. A local organization, Landmapp, was subcontracted to complete mapping of community boundaries and individual cocoa farms and store electronic records. ECOM’s extension agents were trained in tenure principles and provided with training materials and simple, laminated fact sheets to help them resolve land disputes, monitor and assess tenure in their field work, and augment their suite of future trainings. In total, the boundaries of Nyame Nnae community were mapped and 190 farms were surveyed and tenure rights documented, with 37 percent held by women.\nDuring the life of the intervention, the importance of clarifying landowner and tenant relationships through customary contracts emerged as equally important in documenting tenure terms as having a mapped document for the landowner. Clear dispute resolution structures were found to exist within the Asankrangwa stool, though community members were not always well informed about their rights. The team provided training on dispute resolution to community elders, emphasizing disputes and negotiations relating to cocoa farm rehabilitation and negotiated abunu arrangements. At the end of the project, 92 percent of those who received documentation thought it was worthwhile. Community members added that the process provided additional security and information on farm size, and will help reduce conflict. The primary factors that informed farmers’ participation in the project included interests in documentation of land to secure and protect their future investments and to aid in accessing financing options; a desire to know more about site planning; and, interest in farm management more broadly.\nIMPACTS – TREE TENURE\nCurrent law vests rights to naturally occurring trees with the state, which expropriates all rights over timber exploitation and vests them in the government. Despite this legal framework, it became clear that the community views tenure over trees and forest products through the lens of customary land rights, even if this differs from statutory law. The community does, however, distinguish customary rights over trees from timber trees, for which control is vested in the Forestry Commission by formal law. The community views timber trees as being owned by the government.\nThe interplay between government policy, timber extraction, and planting trees laying claim to land ownership creates perverse outcomes: planted trees are pulled up by customary land holders; land disputes emerge between tree planters and customary land holders; and, there are disincentives to plant commercial trees. While these conflicts were not directly observed within Nyame Nnae, the Forestry Commission is aware of challenges with the current law and policy. New policy approaches are being considered and tested. Upon analysis, many aspects of the tree registration system proposed by the Forestry Commission were still in flux and do not go far enough, as the system maintains the distinction between planted and naturally occurring trees. This distinction causes confusion and scope for abuse, as failure to register planted shade trees may result in de facto treatment as naturally occurring and therefore subject to state expropriation. The administrative costs of registering trees are also steep. The team decided not to test the draft tree tenure registration documentation because of reservations about the proposed policy changes, their long-term efficacy, and the potential to create confusion.\nIMPACTS – FINANCIAL MODEL FOR FARM REHABILITATION\nFarm level rehabilitation was carried out on a total of 50 ha spread over 71 self-selected farms and was financed by private sector partner ECOM. Ten of these farms were within Nyame Nnae community (four women and six men) and 61 (12 women and 49 men) were spread across multiple different cocoa communities where ECOM operates. To help ECOM implement agroforestry practices in farm rehabilitation, 20 ECOM extension agents participated in TGCC’s training of trainers agroforestry course.\nTo better understand how to finance rehabilitation, ECOM and TGCC developed a financial model for cocoa farm rehabilitation. Under the model ECOM rehabilitates and manages all farm activities over three years while the farmer learns farm rehabilitation and management techniques and diversifies their income with cash crops. This approach differs from using model farms, which have had mixed success. In this model a farmer provides three acres of old cocoa trees to be cleared and has additional cocoa farms elsewhere, which will continue producing cocoa. Two of the three acres are replanted with cocoa, shade trees (if needed), maize, and plantains, and the third acre is planted with maize and plantains only. Plantain and maize is then planted with two crops of maize and one of plantain harvested per year. The models show that ECOM’s rehabilitation and management costs are repaid over three years, and a profit share or royalty payment paid to the farmer provides enough cash for the farmers to continue activities once ECOM no longer provides support.\nOTHER LESSONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nThe pilot overall, as measured by beneficiary satisfaction, was highly successful. Both men and women farmers, landlords and tenants, and leaders of Asankrangwa stool voiced their appreciation and satisfaction with accomplishments. The following list of final lessons and recommendations were drawn from the pilot:\n- Build understanding of the relevance of land tenure and identify feasible interventions for private sector interests. Partners need to be provided with targeted and actionable information to participate.\n- Time is required to fully apply learning and adaptive management principles. While lessons were learned in the pilot, they could not always be integrated into practice due to short timeframes.\n- Document rights in advance of land disputes, where possible. Clarifying tenure can help to avoid disputes more easily than resolving disputes.\n- For effective land rights documentation, focus on process, engagement and documenting the status “on the ground.” Rather than forcing customary rights to be converted to statutory leaseholds, use formal legal contracts to document the existing customary rights of farmers.\n- Formalizing land rights in Ghana requires more than simply documentation. Engagement of the National House of Chiefs was important to codify land rights in traditional areas and discuss the relationship between indigene and stranger farmers.\n- Food security and nutrition is an issue for cocoa farmers. Rehabilitation efforts must consider food security needs, particularly during the years before cocoa trees start producing.\n- The Nyame Nnae pilot site is only one of multiple theories of change linking property rights to deforestation in Ghana. This pilot lessens the threat on a nearby gazetted forest and increases incentives to reduce deforestation of remnant and secondary forests within the community that now set in motion can be monitored in future years. Options for reducing deforestation at a larger landscape lever were identified and scaling up will need to demonstrate avoided deforestation impact.\n- Not all smallholder farmers are equal; other rehabilitation pilots being tested are geared toward the privileged. The ECOM financial model can be sustainable, but will be difficult to scale up and reach poorer farmers without multiple plots or stranger farmers with insecure tenure.\n- While documenting land rights was a success, tree rights documentation still needs to be considered. For farmers to fully benefit from their land rights, they need to have rights to all resources on their property.\n- The project successfully demonstrated that a public-private partnership linking tenure documentation, alternative dispute resolution, community engagement, and financial modelling with cocoa rehabilitation was feasible. Cocoa companies welcome the addition of new services to their portfolio.\n- Scalability remains a challenge. Wrapping the cost of documentation into cocoa farm rehabilitation should be explored in any future work.\n- The government’s acceptance of formalization pilots is still a question. A wholesale mind shift that recognizes the need to build shade back into cocoa systems and improve productivity of cocoa on less land is starting to occur, but requires additional political will.\n- Spend time on gender dynamics and social inclusion. Interventions must be designed so that community members better understand how women and different status groups engage within the community.\n- A public-private model can be considered to help bear the costs of public goods. Private sector firms are offering services to their suppliers, and welcome the ability to work with public institutions and public policy.\n- After all is said and done, consent of traditional authorities is the central ingredient for success. Traditional leaders need to be full partners in the process of documenting rights and should not just use the system to extract fees.\nThe generalized approach of using land administration, broadening access to finance, and assisting farmers with cocoa rehabilitation is broadly relevant to other geographies and commodities with adequate nuancing and tailoring to the context and constraints faced. There is a wealth of diverse land administration tools and approaches to draw upon, depending on the nature of tenure insecurity and financial constraints faced by small farmers. The approach is also broadly relevant for reducing deforestation although time is needed to determine the full impacts achieved. The GIS survey data collected by the pilot is broadly applicable to monitoring deforestation in the future with scaling, but further work would be required to determine how avoided deforestation impact could be measured and predicted.\nWithin this context, the setting has been established for ongoing efforts by the private and public sectors to develop a strategy for lowering cost and designing innovations that improve the livelihoods of Ghana’s cocoa farmers, promote sustainable cocoa cultivation that reduce deforestation pressures, improve the profitability of the chocolate industry, and provide consumers worldwide with high quality chocolate sourced from Ghana.']	['<urn:uuid:e2fb151a-feb2-452f-ac71-00a170e42110>', '<urn:uuid:4f2de92d-0591-4b84-a6c4-bcf9290e5ddc>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	6	125	3580

For vehicle preparation, maintain at least half-full gas tank and carry a winter emergency car kit including blankets, extra clothing, flashlight with spare batteries, non-perishable foods, windshield scraper, shovel, sand, tow rope and jumper cables in the trunk.	"['EAST KINGSTON — With a stretch of extremely low temperatures hitting New England over the next several days, Chief Ed Warren and the East Kingston Fire Department released suggested safety tips.\nAccording to the New Hampshire Emergency Management Agency, daytime high temperatures will likely not rise above the teens from Thursday through the weekend, and high temperatures in some inland locations may not rise above the single digits. Overnight low temperatures will likely drop below zero.\nThe coldest periods are forecast to be Wednesday night into Thursday morning and Thursday night into Friday morning. Another bout of especially cold wind chills is possible Saturday night into Sunday morning and Sunday night into Monday morning.\n""Temperatures this cold can be extremely dangerous to people and their property if the proper safety precautions are not taken,"" Warren said. ""We are urging residents to dress appropriately if they have to be outside and to ensure you have sufficient heating fuel and properly functioning appliances to prevent problems like frozen pipes or carbon monoxide leaks.""\nWith this type of weather, frostbite and hypothermia are possible for those without proper protection from the cold. To stay safe, the East Kingston Fire Department asks that residents follow these tips from the New Hampshire Emergency Management Agency:\nMinimize outdoor activities for the whole family, including pets.\nIf outside, dress in several layers of loose-fitting, lightweight clothing instead of a single heavy layer. Outer garments should be tightly woven and water repellent. Wear a hat, mittens (not gloves) and sturdy waterproof boots to protect your extremities. Cover your mouth with a scarf to protect your lungs.\nBe a good neighbor. Check with elderly or disabled relatives and neighbors to ensure their safety.\nAdditionally, because of the extreme cold, other areas of your home and vehicles may be affected:\nIncreased fire risk due to unsafe/improper use of alternative heating sources or people trying to thaw frozen pipes with blowtorches or similar devices.\nIf you turn on a faucet and only a trickle comes out, suspect a frozen pipe. Locate the area of the water pipe that might be frozen. Likely places include pipes running against exterior walls or where your water service enters your home through the foundation.\nApply heat to the section of pipe using an electric heating pad wrapped around the pipe, an electric hair dryer, or wrapping pipes with towels soaked in hot water. Do not use a blowtorch, kerosene or propane heater, charcoal stove, or other open flame devices. A blowtorch can make water in a frozen pipe boil and cause the pipe to explode. All open flames in homes present a serious fire danger, as well as a severe risk of exposure to lethal carbon monoxide.\nPossible increase in incidents of carbon monoxide poisoning from unsafe/improper use of alternative heating sources.\nEnsure you have sufficient heating fuel, as well as alternate emergency heating equipment in case you lose electricity.\nWhen utilizing alternate heating sources, such as an emergency generator, your fireplace, wood stove or space heater, make sure they are properly ventilated and always operate a generator outdoors and away from your home. Improper use of heating devices can lead to dangerous carbon monoxide buildup in the home.\nMake sure your car is properly winterized. Keep the gas tank at least half-full. Carry a winter emergency car kit including blankets, extra clothing, a flashlight with spare batteries, non-perishable foods, windshield scraper, shovel, sand, tow rope and jumper cables in the trunk.', 'Brave Missoula Winters – Cold Weather Safety\nMany Missoula residents will admit they have a love/hate relationship with Montana’s brutal winters. Complete with sleet, graupel, snowdrifts that claim ownership of your vehicle. As annoying as our travel set-backs can be, the primary goal is preparing to actually brave the frigid conditions outdoors. Most importantly, whether traveling by vehicle or walking, is preparing children to brave these conditions with us. Many parents want to safely travel with their kiddos (no matter what age), so read on to learn how…\n10 Cold Weather Safety Tips for Kids\nMaintain a sunny disposition\nDon’t let the frigid temps fool you. It’s still not time to pack away the sunscreen. In fact, snow reflects more than 75% of the sun’s damaging ultraviolet rays. So, plan a visit to your basement, storage unit, or anywhere else you might have packed your summer gear and locate the box you may have thrown the bottle of sunscreen in to. (In my experience, it’s always the last box in the back under the heaviest items you store.) Or you can just visit the store and pick up a new tube, but don’t expect an after season price decrease.\nAs you just learned, sunscreen is in demand year-round. While bundled up for cold weather fun, you typically only expose your face, so pay special attention to slathering sunscreen there and any other spots that are not covered with clothing.\nSnug as a bug in a rug – but not TOO snug\nWinter wear should fit your kids properly, but gear shouldn’t be so tight that it restricts movement. This is an especially important rule for footwear. Too-tight boots constrict blood flow, which causes feet to become even colder. When sizing boots, allow room for an extra pair of thick boot socks.\nBe clever about clothing choices\nWhen sending your little ones off to school or out to play, make sure they’re dressed warmly in layers that are wind and waterproof (or at least water resistant). If possible, opt for wool base layers, but cotton works fine. Help them stay warm with adequate head, face, hands and neck protection. You can save time while getting your brood out the door by storing gloves and scarves inside of hats.\nGet around safe and sound\nWinter driving in Missoula can be very dangerous, so you need to make sure you are properly prepared for any situation. Prepare your car for such emergencies by keeping the following must-haves in your trunk: a first-aid kit, blankets, shovel, rock salt, ice scraper, water and non-perishable snacks.\nPractice safety when playing winter sports\nIf you are unable to supervise your child, make sure there will be a responsible adult who you trust to take the duty. Ice needs to have a proper inspection before anyone starts lacing up their ice skates. Sled paths shouldn’t be too overcrowded or too close to roadways. The safest sleds are those that allow for steering, so avoid snow tubes or disk shaped sleds. If your little ones want to try snowboarding or skiing, consider getting lessons from a qualified instructor. While out on the slopes, they should always wear helmets and gloves with built-in wrist guards and be accompanied by an experienced adult.\nServe superior snacks\nGood nutrition can help kids fight off cold and flu season. Strengthen their immunity with balanced nutrition. Snack time is a great opportunity to sneak in some extra nutrients; try dry and fresh fruits, sliced raw veggies, whole wheat crackers with cheese and yogurt.\nKeep them hydrated\nAlthough your kids may not sweat as much as they do when in warmer weather, they still need to be well hydrated. Smart choices for winter are low-sugar juices that are high in Vitamin C (which studies have shown can lessen the duration and severity of colds). Decaffeinated tea and hot cocoa are also wise picks – these comforting, hot drinks are a great source of antioxidants, which are believed to strengthen the immune system.\nMake your home a safe haven\nBe prepared for unpredictable weather conditions by stocking up on essentials, such as extra batteries for flashlights, bottled water, first-aid staples and nonperishable food items. These safety kits can help protect your family in extreme situations.\nGet your kids prepared\nMake sure your kids have an extra pair of gloves and tissue packs tucked into their backpacks. These necessities will help prevent the spread of germs and come in handy if a glove goes missing.\nHeat your home safely\nBefore temperatures fall below freezing, make sure your home’s heating equipment and your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors function properly. If you own a space heater, keep it away from small children or, better yet, don’t use one at all. Don’t forget to discuss fire safety with your family each winter; the likelihood of indoor fires increases during the colder months, according to the National Fire Protection Association.\nWith these tips, and using a bit of common sense, you and your family can have a fun-filled and safe winter season.']"	['<urn:uuid:d73cd19d-898e-4546-9969-6d4210a9159f>', '<urn:uuid:a8228611-b4b8-4963-8ab7-9618b5c55571>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	10	58	1419
62	What preventive measures can protect plants from both fungal diseases and pest infestations, and how should these problems be treated once they appear?	To prevent both fungal diseases and pest infestations, maintaining proper growing conditions is essential. For fungal issues like branch dieback in Eugenia, plants should be spaced 4-6 feet apart, and water splashing on foliage should be avoided. If fungal infection occurs, infected branches should be pruned 4 inches below symptomatic areas using sanitized tools. For pest control, good cultural practices help create unsuitable conditions for insects to breed and feed. Different pests require specific treatments - for example, California red scales can be controlled with insecticidal soap applied every two weeks, while whiteflies require an integrated approach combining mulch, traps, and manual removal, as they have developed resistance to chemical pesticides. For both fungal and pest problems, keeping plants stress-free through proper care is crucial for prevention.	"['With their dense growth habit and evergreen foliage, Eugenias, including dwarf brush cherry (Eugenia myrtifolia ""Compactus"") and ""Monterey Bay"" brush cherry (Eugenia myrtifolia ""Monterey Bay""), can be trained as topiaries. Both grow in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 9 through 11. They are typically problem-free, although some Eugenia topiaries may lose leaves over time. Most causes of leaf loss are minor and treatable, although some may cause irreversible damage and eventual death.\nCultural problems can cause leaf drop in Eugenia shrubs, which is particularly noticeable when they are grown as tightly pruned, manicured topiaries. The wrong watering, sun exposure or temperatures below 32 degrees Fahrenheit are all common causes of leaf loss in Eugenia topiaries, but soluble salt buildup from hard water or may also cause premature leaf loss. Other symptoms include wilting and a chlorotic, or yellow, appearance along the central rib of otherwise healthy leaves, as well as burned leaf edges and branch death.\nCorrecting underlying cultural problems will reverse most instances of leaf loss in Eugenia topiaries, although it may take time for the new growth to emerge. Eugenia shrubs perform best when grown in full sun with some light afternoon shade in hot, dry inland climates. A sudden change in sun exposure will cause stress-related leaf loss, so avoid moving the topiary to a radically different light exposure. Water deeply whenever the soil feels dry in the top 1/2 inch and use distilled or filtered water with a low mineral content to prevent salt buildup on the soil surface. If salt buildup occurs, flush the soil with fresh distilled water and avoid applying fertilizer for at least one month.\nOne of the most devastating causes of leaf loss in Eugenia topiaries is branch dieback, which is an infection caused by the fungus Neofusicoccum parvum. It happens mostly in late summer when temperatures are at their peak and wanes as the weather cools. Infected shrubs develop crisp, brown foliage that will persist for a week or so before dropping, as well as reddish discolorations at the base of the branches. No surefire treatment exists for branch dieback, so prevention and palliative care are key.\nTreatment and Prevention\nHealthy, stress-free Eugenia topiaries are less likely to develop infections like branch dieback, so providing the right growing conditions and care is crucial. Space the topiaries at least 4 to 6 feet apart to limit the chances of infection, and avoid splashing water on the foliage because excess moisture provides a prime environment for fungal growth. If symptoms occur, the infected branch should be pruned 4 inches below the symptomatic portion using freshly sanitized pruning shears, and the shears should be cleaned with a 25 percent bleach solution after use to keep the infection from spreading. Discard the pruned Eugenia branches rather than using them as mulch or compost.\nPest infestations seldom cause serious damage to healthy Eugenia topiaries. Already stressed shrubs may attract an insect colony large enough to cause leaf drop or other worrying symptoms. California red scale (Aonidiella aurantii) and woolly whitefly (Aleurothrixus floccosus) are two common culprits behind leaf drop in Eugenia topiaries. In addition to leaf drop, they may also cause deformed leaves, stunting and reduced vigor. Woolly whiteflies produce distinctive white, cottony masses on the undersides of the leaves.\nTreatment and Prevention\nGood cultural practices will reduce the chances of a serious pest infestation both by limiting stress to the Eugenia topiary and by creating unsuitable conditions for insects to breed and feed. Once an infestation occurs, the mode of treatment varies according to the type of insect. California red scales can be controlled by spraying the leaves thoroughly with a ready-to-use insecticidal soap at two-week intervals until the problem subsides. Woolly whiteflies are harder to control once a large colony is established, so limiting their numbers is crucial. A combination of mulch, traps and manual removal is best for adult whiteflies, while the pupae can be controlled by applying insecticidal soap weekly until their numbers decline.\n- University of Florida IFAS Extension: Branch Dieback of Syzygium Paniculatum (Eugenia)\n- Monrovia: Dwarf Brush Cherry\n- Monrovia: Monterey Bay Brush Cherry\n- National Gardening Association: Eugenia Topiary Leaves Falling Off\n- Topiary Creations: Topiary Care\n- University of California Statewide Integrated Pest Management Program: Eugenia\n- George Doyle/Stockbyte/Getty Images', 'Garden Pests Identification is essential because these pests can chew on plants and damage your garden. These are some of the common garden pests. After proving that gardening is good for health now its time to keep your garden healthy.\nSpider mites are common garden pests that thrive well in hot, dry, and dusty conditions. Residing on the undersides of the leaves of plants, these mites congregate in dense colonies in protective silk webs.\nThey cause damage to the plants by puncturing their cells to feed on them. This, in turn, shows up as a silvering or stippled effect on the leaf top. These garden pests feed on a number of species of plants including ornamental and houseplants as well.\nAlthough various garden insects are known as leaf miners, the most common are the larva of tiny flies that reside in and eat the leaf tissues, creating visible mines between its upper and lower layers.\nThey are identified as garden pests as they cause immense damage garden plants. They can be effectively taken care of by either planting trap crops or encouraging natural parasites.\nScales are sap-sucking garden pests that attach themselves with the host plants in order to feed. They secrete a waxy coating, which makes them look like fish scales. Usually, they appear as shell-like bumps, and before one can realize, they build up huge colonies and start destroying the plants.\nScales are serious pests in the garden, which can only be controlled using horticultural oils, as their waxy covering protects them well from contact insecticides.\nFound in moist and warm climates, mealybugs are unarmored scale pests in the garden that feed on the juices of plants and act as a vector of several plant diseases. While sucking plant juices, these garden pests secrete a powdery wax for their protection and require garden fungus identification. You should properly follow the indoor gardening tips to keep insects away.\nThey are a major menace as they infest and damage various types of plants including mango, grapes, sugarcane, mulberry, pineapple, ferns, sunflower, papaya and orchids. The tenacity of these garden insects increases in the presence of ants, as ants protect from predators and parasites.\nThrips are fringe-winged minute insects that feed on a large variety of plants. They are one of the most commonly found pests in the garden and are considered hazardous. These garden pests feed on them; they cause discoloration, deformities, and reduced marketability of the crops.\nThey are one of the prominent vectors of several plant diseases and are known for transmitting more than 20 plant-infecting viruses.\nAlso known as the plant lice, aphids are small, soft-bodied sap-sucking insects, which are one of the most destructive garden pests in temperate regions. They usually cluster on the tips of new growth and leaf undersides and starting sucking plant juices, which cause the leaves to become distorted and yellow.\nAphids share a unique relationship with ants, as the later farms and protects them in order to extract honeydew secreted by the former. This process is known as tending, and it causes black sooty fungus to grow on leaves. Aphids reproduce at a rapid rate, which makes them quite menacing. They also spread diseases among plants.\nWhiteflies are tiny garden insects that commonly feed on the undersides of plant leaves and stems. These menacing garden pests carry and spread garden diseases, thereby posing as a great agricultural threat globally. These pests are really dangerous specially for flower plants.\nThese flies feed by sucking into the phloem of plants and while doing so release a toxic saliva that decreases the plants’ overall turgor pressure. These hazardous pests in the garden are known for congregating in large numbers, which causes rapid degeneration in susceptible plants.\nControlling the outburst of whiteflies is a challenging problem, for these tiny garden pests have developed resistance towards chemical pesticides. Therefore, an integrated approach with biological control methods is required for achieving the same.\nSo, make sure that your garden is protected and identify garden pests.\nAlso Read: A Beginner’s Guide To Container Gardening']"	['<urn:uuid:d95cf107-aac6-4238-9206-ca477a2bc498>', '<urn:uuid:a5ed2f26-1f7c-4d82-a6d8-a2f89bf82a9c>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	23	127	1392
63	As someone fascinated by historical methods of spreading information, I'm curious about how ancient messages were shared. How did Jesus's approach to spreading his message compare with how ancient civilizations communicated through their transportation networks?	Jesus used a strategic approach to spreading his message, first teaching in synagogues himself, then training disciples and sending them out with specific instructions to proclaim the message that 'the kingdom of heaven has come near.' He emphasized the importance of reaching specific communities, initially focusing on the 'lost sheep of Israel.' In comparison, ancient civilizations in Mesopotamia developed extensive road networks that served as communication channels. These 5,000-year-old roadways, visible in satellite images, created an interconnected system that enabled the spread of both goods and cultural information between settlements. The roads, which were 200-400 feet wide, facilitated exchange between expanding local settlements and cultures from southern Mesopotamia, contributing to the development of urban civilization in the third millennium BC.	['Scripture readings: Gen. 18:1-15 and Ps. 116:1-2, 12-19 or Ex. 19:2-8 and Ps. 100:1-5; Rom. 5:1-8; Matt. 9:35-10:8 Sermon by Martin Manuel from Matt. 9:35-10:8\nJESUS SEES A HARVEST FIELD—DO WE?\nThough Jesus tried to contain his popularity, his reputation spread like wildfire throughout Galilee and on into Judea. Wherever he went, crowds followed, many hoping to receive healing and help from this miracle-working rabbi. In chapter 9, Matthew cites case after case of Jesus acting on requests for help from people around him. Amazed crowds (Matt. 9:8, 33) gathered wherever he went. Desperate people flocked to him.\nThis is the backdrop of today’s Gospel lesson. We find Jesus recognizing a great, ripe, spiritual harvest field and sending his apostles out into it to reap. But what does this passage have to do with us today? In this sermon we’ll see that Jesus gives us the same invitation and challenge. May we have ears to hear.\n1. Jesus cares and acts\nTruly caring about the state of humanity, Jesus acts. Note Matthew 9:\nJesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. (Matthew 9:35-36)\nIn this country beaten down by the Roman occupiers, Jesus’ message about the kingdom of God was relevant and attention-grabbing. But just as compelling was the compassion he showed in response to the people’s need, offering help and healing. Jesus viewed these “harassed and helpless” people as “sheep without a shepherd.” Other leaders might have seen this situation as an opportunity to grab a following, but not Jesus. Showing his compassionate heart for suffering humanity, he reached out to address their needs, both physical and spiritual.\n2. Jesus assesses and prays\nThen in Matthew 9:37, Jesus uses a metaphor to describe to his followers his assessment of the situation: “The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few.” It was as if Jesus was standing before a field, perhaps a large wheat field, ready for harvest, and having the frustrating feeling that although he desires that the harvest be brought in, the task of doing so is too great for one person.\nHave you ever felt that way? Suppose your house desperately needs attention: repairs, cleaning, painting—months of work for one person, but you need it done soon. You’ll have to hire carpenters, electricians, plumbers, a cleaning service crew and a team of painters.\nSeeing the enormity of the fields ripe for harvest, rather than heading out to hire a crew, Jesus turned to prayer, saying this to his disciples: “Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field” (Matt. 9:38). This is how Jesus thought—this is the prayerful, dependent posture by which he lived. Jesus’ first priority always was to pray, and here he shares that priority with his disciples. Whereas the natural tendency is to see prayer as the last resort, Jesus wanted his followers to understand that prayer must precede any efforts of our own in the harvest field. Why? Because the field belongs to the Lord, who not only creates the fruit, but is able to supply the laborers needed to reap the harvest.\n3. Jesus assembles and commissions\nJesus’ next step was to assemble a team of harvesters using resources God had made available. These resources were available because Jesus had followed God’s earlier instructions to call and equip a team for ministry. The time to send that team into the mission field had arrived:\nJesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness (Matt. 10:1).\nJesus gave his team of followers authority. This was the extension to them of the authority Jesus possessed as Messiah. Note Isaiah’s prophecy:\nThe Spirit of the Sovereign LORD is on me, because the LORD has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners. (Isa. 61:1)\nThis authority was not automatically conferred on the disciples when they began following Jesus. But now the time had come for them to be sent out bearing some of Jesus’ authority. Note that Matthew calls them apostles (Matt. 10:2), meaning “ones sent” (Matt. 10:5). Jesus was giving them a temporary commission to go to work in the harvest field.\nAs we know, no job of any significance can be done without instruction and training. Parents know that even the simplest tasks, such as making up a bed or cleaning a room, will be incomplete if attempted by untrained children. Children need to be trained; merely issuing orders will not get the job done. Wise parents often start by doing the task first while the child watches. Next, the parent participates with the child as the child tries to do the task, then they step back and watch the child do the task, giving both encouraging and gently corrective feedback. When the child understands, the parent can delegate the task to the child.\nJesus had been training his disciples for months before this commissioning. They had watched him work and had begun to participate with him. Now it was time for further training that involved a specific assignment, and so Jesus sent them out with these instructions:\nDo not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. As you go, proclaim this message: “The kingdom of heaven has come near.” Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give. (Matt. 10:5-8)\nNote that their primary task was to proclaim the gospel in a particular way that included words concerning the kingdom of heaven. These words were apparently specific to this mission—they are not included in the many examples of proclaiming the gospel elsewhere in the New Testament. The miraculous works of healing and exorcism were also part of this mission. Later examples of proclaiming the gospel—especially in the book of Acts—do not always include miracles.\n4. The lesson for us\nThough this particular assignment (commission) was temporary, its lesson is timeless, and certainly applicable to us today. The Son of God, sent by the Father and anointed with the Holy Spirit, saw humanity as lost sheep needing a shepherd. Jesus was moved by his compassion to send others, prepared by him to participate in the harvest. It’s important for us to realize that Jesus is alive—our ascended Lord has the same perspective on humanity and on the mission of the church today. With the same compassion, he sees humanity’s needs today. And all along, Jesus has been calling and equipping a team—it’s called the church—a team he sends into the harvest field with specific instructions. They are to go bearing Jesus’ perspective, including his heart of compassion.\nHere’s what we can do to be faithful to who Jesus is and to the commission he has given to us as his fellow harvest workers:\nStart with prayer. Jesus set a wonderful example for us in this. At all times, but particularly when the task seems overwhelming, we should pray. The challenges we face personally and as a congregation are bigger than any one of us and even all of us together apart from the Lord. We need his help!\nRemember that Jesus said that the harvest has a Lord. Do we look at our tasks that way? Do we see what appears to be mountains before us and realize that there is a Lord of those mountains? When Jesus explained that the Lord of the harvest would send laborers, he implied that they would be given a heart like his—a heart of compassion for lost people. We do not need to try to work up that heart, but we can and should pray for it.\nGet equipped. Jesus started with prayer, but he did not stop there. Our next step is to act according to our current abilities and training. As individuals and congregations this is a challenge. Jesus invested much time to train his disciples. In the same way, church leaders must train today’s followers of Jesus. Each of us has a role according to the gifts we have been given. Whatever the gift and role, whether participating in community service, giving personal assistance, telling people about Jesus, or being part of an outreach team, we must be receptive to the training opportunities available.\nGet going. Finally, having been equipped and instructed, we go into the harvest field (where prayer and equipping continues). As in farming crops, each harvest field is unique, but some things apply to all.\nHere is an example [the preacher may want to substitute an example more relevant to their congregation]:\nA small North Carolina GCI congregation has been getting out into the “harvest field” that is their neighborhood. They received training and instructions from their pastoral team, but all they really needed to do was engage with the neighbors around their place of meeting. Through an open house, an outreach event to support families of school children returning after summer break, a fall festival, and other activities, the members started to get involved with the neighbors and that involvement continued to grow. Where needs arose, they helped. As a result, the congregation became known in the community as people who care and want to help in any way they can. As a result, a number of neighbors investigated the congregation more deeply and some began attending and some became members. The church members called their endeavors to be involved in the community “outreach.” The New Testament calls it “good works.” Jesus calls it going out into the harvest field to both sow and reap.\nHow a congregation obeys Jesus’ call to enter into his work in the harvest field will depend on the particular needs of the neighborhood and circumstances of the both the neighbors and the church members. In all cases, expressing the love of the Triune God for humanity as Jesus did is the key. Even where the gospel is not immediately embraced, a positive example of God’s love can move people to respond later. Even if people in the neighborhood do not attend our church but choose to attend elsewhere, we need not be disappointed. The important thing is that people respond to the good news of Jesus Christ and begin to entrust their lives to him. Any way or time that a person accepts Jesus Christ and enters a life of trusting the Father through Christ and by the Spirit, we can and should rejoice! We are participating with Jesus in what he is doing to express his heart of compassion for harassed and helpless lost sheep.\nAs Jesus looks at the world, he sees fields ripe for harvest. He wants his followers to see the fields around them, and participate with him in reaping the harvest near at hand. Are we moved with his compassion to pray for workers? Are we willing to be trained, instructed and sent?\nPerhaps these questions should be in the forefront of our minds as we exit the powerful seasons of Easter and Pentecost and embark upon the period called in the Lectionary, “ordinary time”? As we’ve seen today, though it involves living day to day, there is nothing ordinary about it.\nIf you’d like to give your audience a look at a harvest, here are two videos:', '|Jan. 28, 2003||\nPress Contact: William Harms|\nSatellite photographs reveal ancient road system\nArchaeologists at the University of Chicago’s Oriental Institute have used recently declassified satellite surveillance images to show that subtle land depressionswhich had gone largely unnoticed by scholarsare actually the remnants of ancient roadways that knitted together the fabric of emerging civilizations in the ancient Near East.\nThese 5,000-year-old roadways were important thoroughfares for agricultural exchange and other commerce in an area of Syria and Iraq. It was here that expanding local settlements were coming into contact with cultures from southern Mesopotamia as urban civilization developed in the third millennium B.C., according to Tony Wilkinson, Research Associate at the institute, and Jason Ur, a researcher at the institute.\nThe ancient roads went out of service when better routes emerged late in the first millennium B.C. Because the old roads were in slight depressions, they became locations where local people gathered moist clay for mud bricks. Over the years, the roadways faded and they largely escaped the attention of archaeologists.\nAlthough research by the Oriental Institute team focuses on the northern reaches of Mesopotamia, the roads probably were common throughout the region, the scholars said.\nThe roadways were 200 to 400 feet wide and 20 to 24 inches deep. They were made by early people who herded their livestock to fields for pasture and between towns as part of the emerging economic system. Continual traffic by people, animals and vehicles hardened the surface and caused the roadway to sink into the landscape.\nThese inter-site routes are more than connections between towns and nearby settlements, the scholars said. “When considered at a regional level, these routes emerge as segments of larger ‘highways’ that run from site to site on a generally east-west axis,” wrote Ur in his paper, “CORONA Satellite Photography and Ancient Road Networks: A Northern Mesopotamian Case Study,” to be published in the spring issue of the journal Antiquity.\nPreviously, archaeologists had drawn straight lines between major settlements, supposing a road system connected them, but not knowing its exact location. Now, rather than connecting the dots in an abstract way, they are able to see where the roads were and how they meandered between settlements.\nThe information also shows that the most important towns were those with the most roadways leading to them. The recent Oriental Institute work in northeastern Syria is based on two sites, Tell Brak and Tell Hamoukar, both of which emerge as communities of some importance in the third millennium B.C.\nThe satellite images show that Tell Hamoukarthe site of a continuing Oriental Institute expeditionwas a more important site than scholars had previously thought. Wilkinson and Ur agree it probably was on a road system that stretched from Nineveh, in what is now northern Iraq, to possibly Aleppo in western Syria near the Mediterranean.\n“For the Early Bronze Age, new conclusions can be drawn about the underlying economy, which had a large role in producing this pattern of settlements and roads,” Ur said. “The agricultural backbone of these towns is vividly illustrated by the abundant radial system of roads, although the interconnectedness of these systems suggests a far more integrated agricultural economy than originally recognized.”\nHigh-value luxury goods, such as textiles and metals, also traveled on these routes. Now with a better picture of how communities were connected, scholars will be able to further document trade using ancient texts.\nLast modified at 05:05 PM CST on Monday, April 14, 2003.\n5801 South Ellis Avenue - Room 200\nChicago, Illinois 60637-1473\nFax: (773) 702-8324']	['<urn:uuid:a5943866-c92d-4c3d-aafd-2a562238b1f8>', '<urn:uuid:04619de0-46d8-4f41-a89f-8138a8170242>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	35	120	2534

The Sahara desert's arid climate preserves meteorites from corrosion due to low rainfall, making it the place with most meteorite findings. In contrast, minerals like edscottite found in meteorite cores were preserved by being forged in the molten core of ancient planets under intense heat and pressure.	"['MV’s Wedderburn meteorite reveals\nDr Stuart Mills with the Wedderburn meteorite. Scientists have discovered a new mineral buried inside it, forged in the core of a planet that no longer exists. Credit: Justin McManus.\nLiam Mannix, This meteorite came from the core of another planet. Inside it, a new mineral, The Age, 1 September 2019\nScientists have discovered a new mineral, one never before seen in nature, lodged inside a meteorite found near Wedderburn in central Victoria.\nThey believe the mineral was likely forged in the molten core of an ancient planet long since destroyed.\nThe meteorite is red and black and deeply scarred from its million-year-plus journey, and certainly looks the part. The mineral it contains has been christened edscottite.\nThe mineral was found after close examination of the Wedderburn Meteorite, a lemon-sized chunk of metal found just outside Wedderburn in 1951, and now a part of Museums Victoria’s collection.\nWe have found many meteorites, but a meteorite from the core of another planet is extremely rare.\nOver the years several inquisitive scientists from around the world, desperate to study it, have managed to secure slices; only 71 grams of the original 220-gram rock are still held within the museum’s vaults.\nA team from CalTech in the US managed to get their hands on a slice in 2018, to see if it contained any rare minerals.\nA mineral is an arrangement of atoms in different shapes. Diamond, for example, is an arrangement of carbon atoms. Graphite in the tip of a pencil is carbon too, but arranged in a different structure.\nInside the meteorite, sandwiched between other layers of minerals, the researchers found a thin sliver of a new material. Under a microscope, it resembles tiny white crystals.\nThe mineral, they discovered, is made of iron and carbon atoms mixed together into a certain pattern. They named it edscottite, after Edward Scott, a pioneering cosmochemist at the University of Hawaii.\n“This meteorite had an abundance of carbon in it. And as it slowly cooled down, the iron and carbon came together and formed this mineral,” says Dr Stuart Mills, Museums Victoria’s senior curator of geosciences.\nScientists have come across edscottite before, inside smelters. It is one of the phases iron goes through when it is smelted into steel.\nBut they have never seen it naturally occurring. And minerals only get a name when you can find them in nature.\n“We have discovered 500,000 to 600,000 minerals in the lab, but fewer than 6000 that nature’s done itself,” says Dr Mills.\nNow, about that planet. What happened to it?\n“It got blasted apart,” says Geoffrey Bonning, a planetary scientist at the Australian National University.\nOur solar system – the Earth, Australia, you and me – started out as dust emitted by long-dead stars.\nThat dust swirled through space until gravity finally started to pull it together, bit by bit. Those lumps grew larger and larger, first forming grains of sand, then big chunks, then kilometre-wide asteroids.\nEventually those asteroids chunked together to form planets.\n“All rocks to some degree are a little bit radioactive,” says Mr Bonning. “So this planet, it starts to melt inside.”\nHot metal would have dripped down into the planet’s core. The heat and pressure generated minerals like edscottite.\nAnd then, at some point, the planet got blasted apart. It was probably hit by another planet or moon, or a huge asteroid, says Mr Bonning. Many planets were created and destroyed in the early days of the solar system.\nRubble from the collision was strewn across the solar system, much of it ending up in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The Wedderburn meteorite circled out there for a few million years, before a chance collision sent it racing towards Earth.', 'Revised 2010 Edition\nby Eric Wichman\nMost people don’t know you can own a meteorite much less find one practically in your own back yard. There\'s a very good chance there\'s been meteorites found very near where you are right now. There\'s been over 50,000 meteorites found in the world and 1600 of those have been found right in the united States.\nKnow Where To Hunt For Meteorites The first thing you need is a place to hunt. If you live in the southwest U.S. you are in prime meteorite hunting territory. This area of the country lends itself to the preservation of meteoritic material. Because of the southwest’s arid climate, and low annual rainfall, meteorites are more preserved here than in any other part of the U.S. Meteorites contain iron and iron is prone to corrosion, therefore a dryer climate will preserve meteorites for a longer period of time.\nThat’s why more meteorites are found in the Sahara desert than any other place on earth!\nNorthwest African meteorites (better known as NWA meteorites) are plentiful because the climate is perfect. The Sahara desert covers the entire northern region of Africa!\nAnywhere there’s “Old Ground” and the climate is arid, you’ll most likely find meteorites. They’re hard to find and rarer than gold but when you find one there’s a chance there’s more in that area.\nMeteorite Hunting: How To Find Meteorites\nWant to know how to find meteorites? Subscribe to our new meteorite magazine. Meteorite Hunting & Collecting.

In it we introduce the beginner meteorite hunter, and collector to meteorites, and also have articles by scientists, astronmers, researchers and other experts in their field. MHC magazine is chock full of how to articles, meteorite hunting stories, and science articles related to meteorites and astronomy. Subscribe Today View The Digital Edition FREE! READ IT NOW\nWhere NOT To Hunt: First and foremost. Do not hunt on land you don\'t have permission to hunt on. This is perhaps the most important rule in the meteorite world. Trespassing is illegal. Don\'t do it. People that do, make it harder on the rest of the meteorite community, and it can tarnish reputations and turn people off to the professional meteorite hunters that do follow the rules.\nAlso, not all terrain lends itself to meteorite hunting. Swamps wouldn’t be a good place to look, but anywhere that is relatively dry, with old ground is a great place to hunt. You can find meteorites just about anywhere on the planet. The Willamette meteorite for example (the largest meteorite ever found in the United States at 15.5 tons) was found in Oregon of all places. I don’t know if you’ve ever been to Oregon but it rains there in the forested areas almost daily. A lot of the Willamette had weathered away but it still is the biggest meteorite yet to be found in the U.S.\nIf a chondrite (stone meteorite) falls in the ocean, the iron in it breaks down and will crumble into nothing in a short period of time. Water, humidity, and wind erosion contribute greatly to a meteorite’s demise.\nA Little About Me I\'ve been a wilderness junky all my life. I was born and raised in the sticks and spent my entire childhood and early adult life stomping around the wilds of Florida so I know a thing or two about hunting, and the outdoors. My dad was a sergeant in the Army and he raised us like little soldiers. He always told my sister and I to “Always Be Prepared”. We spent so much time in the wilderness it was like a second home to us. We would go on hunting trips and survival trips like other people went to the movies. This was great training for meteorite hunting!\nBack to finding meteorites… The first thing you need is a place to hunt. Not all terrain lends itself to meteorite hunting. Florida is a considerably different environment than the Southwest United States. Swamps, marshes, beaches and dense forests cover most of Florida.\nMeteorites are typically found in arid, dry, desert locales. However you can find meteorites just about anywhere on the planet. The Willamette meteorite for example (the largest meteorite ever found in the United States) was found in Oregon of all places. I don’t know if you’ve ever been to Oregon but it rains there in the forested areas almost daily. This meteorite was found in a forest, and a lot of it had weathered away but it still is the biggest meteorite yet to be found in the U.S.\nMeteorites Are Cosmic Treasures: Meteorites are rarer than gold and some are more valuable than diamonds, but they are nothing like the precious metals and stones. You must keep in mind they\'re not from our planet. They\'re from out there, in the vast reaches of space. They fly across our solar system and crash into Earth and the feeling one has when one holds a meteorite in their hand is wondrous.\nTools Of The Meteorite Hunter: Let’s start your meteorite hunting adventures off right. You need the equipment, which costs money so you know you\'ll need a job. Unless of course you\'re super rich, but then you could buy any meteorite you wanted. Here\'s a short list of some of the tools you\'ll need to make you meteorite hunting successful.\nYou\'ll need this stuff as a start:\nA Meteorite Stick: Basically a golf club with the head chopped off with a magnet attached on the tip. You\'ll use thisto touch and pick up meteorites on the surface of the ground you are hunting. Meteorite sticks are only good for 3 things, picking up meteorites, as a makeshift walking stick, and to whack those pesky rattle snakes that want to make your leg their lunch.\nA Good Metal Detector: You can find meteorites with a metal detector. But not just any metal detector will do. Though meteorites have iron and can be located with cheap discount store metal detectors, the serious meteorite hunter will spend a little more on a metal detector specifically designed for gold detecting. They\'re more sensitive and tend to find meteorites at much greater depths.\nWhites, Fisher, and Minelab all make great metals detectors that you can use to find meteorites. The Gold Bug Series from Fisher are great for meteorite hunting. Many meteorite hunters like the White\'s GMT, or even the V-SAT. You can expect to spend about $250 to $450 for a good used detector that will find meteorites.\nBuy yourself a few good rare earth disc magnets from these great online suppliers of neodymium magnets.\nGPS Location Device: You absolutely need on of these. It\'s imperative you have on in the field. Not just for marking the location of your meteorite find for classification, but it’s a must have for wilderness navigation.\nRecording meteorite location data is vital to preserving scientifically valuable information. It\'s a rule in the meteorite community that when you find a meteorite to record it\'s coordinates, take a photo of the meteorite ""in-situ"" and the location where it was found, all before removing the stone from it\'s resting place. This helps ensure that the strewnfield data is preserved and that the information isn\'t lost.\nGarmin is by far one of the best GPS devices money can buy. I\'m am of course a bit biased when it comes to equipment. There are other good brands on there but few with the technology Garmin GPS systems offer at such reasonable prices.\nA Good Quality Small Pick Axe (Dig Tool): You’ll use this to dig up your meteorites of course. (Attach A Strong Rare Earth Magnet To The Dig Tool with JBweld or some other epoxy resin, or liquid plastic.) This aids in finding the meteorite faster as most meteorites are magnetic due to the high iron content!\nA small pick axe or dig tool is simply a must for meteorite hunting. Some meteorites are not magnetic but these are harder to find even with a metal detector, and will not give a signal or a very weak signal when using a metal detector. K&J Magnetics sells Neodymium magnets at very reasonable prices. Visit their site here: Rare Earth Neodymium Magnets\nBasic Desert/Outdoor Gear: Maps, Backpack, waist pack, a good knife, multi-tool, rope (parachute cord), water, water, water, food, first aid kit, snake bite kit, tire repair kit. If you are traveling by ATV, or 4X4 it’s good to have a tow strap, shovel, two way radios, and extra fuel and water. This list is not all inclusive, you’ll also need a compass, extra batteries for both the radios and GPS, a flashlight, lighter, matches, plastic baggies, trash bags, and a good book to curl up next to the campfire with. A survival kit is always a good idea as well. This can have fishing line, hooks, a few extra matches, band-aids, alcohol swabs, etc… You get the idea. Don’t forget the cell phone!\nFinding An Area To Hunt Meteorites\nOnce you have all the equipment you need, then you need an area to hunt. This is where good solid research comes in. Do a Google search for the keyword phrase “meteorite database” or visit the Meteoritical Society’s website here: http://tin.er.usgs.gov/meteor/ There you will find a database chock full of great information on ALL the classified finds on the US and the world for that matter, complete with GPS coordinates, and Google Earth links for mapping and satellite photos. You can’t beat this for quality in-depth information.\nNOTE: Don’t just go searching coordinates you find in the database! Some property may be private State or Federal land and you cannot hunt there without permission or making sure you are allowed to hunt there. Get the land owners permission BEFORE you start your hunt. If you are hunting Federal land be sure you have maps! Make sure you know where you are and that it’s legal to hunt that location. This article is NOT meant as legal advise. CYA people. Use common sense. Don’t hunt land you don’t own without permission. Simple as that.\nOK, so now what? You have your equipment, your maps, your trusty meteorite stick and an idea of where to search. Well, get out there and hunt. If you are hunting a dry lake bed it’s very different than hunting in the hills with trees, bushes and big boulders to navigate around.\nMeteorite Hunting With A Metal Detector\nFamiliarize yourself with your metal detector. Buy a few meteorites for calibrating your detector. Once out in the field you can “throw down” the meteorite tune your detector and your off hunting meteorite. Don’t forget to pick the meteorite back up!\nSwing Low & Slow When you’re swinging your detector keep it low to the ground and swing slow and steady until you get used to it. Once you get the hang of it you can speed things up a bit.\nCover Lots Of Ground: There’s a lot of unsearched ground out there. If you grid the area well enough you will find a meteorite, and once you find one you can slow down a bit and search the area a bit more. If you don’t find any more, move on. After a while you will begin to recognize false targets.\nUse Your Eyes: Don’t forget to “look” for the meteorites as well.\nLook for the meteorites with your eyes as well and the detector. Meteorites don\'t look like Earth rocks. Look for rocks that are out of place or just look odd for the area you are hunting. Look for the dark black or brown fusion crust. A weathered meteorite that has been on Earth for a long time will typically turn a red-brown color and sometimes will be shiny due to wind blown sand erosion.\nAnd remember very few magnetic rocks are meteorites, but most meteorites are magnetic.\nHow To Identify Meteorites\nIdentifying Meteorites Once you find a stone you think is a meteorite there are a series of tests you can use to determine if your stone could possibly be a meteorite.\nTo understand how to identify a meteorite you must first know the types of meteorites there are. There is a set of identifying characteristics that most meteorites exhibit that will aid in identification.\nIron & Stone Meteorites Typically most meteorites contain iron and tend to be magnetic. Even Stone type meteorites. They are usually heavier and much more dense than ordinary terrestrial stones due in part to their high iron content. Meteorites contain a higher concentrations of nickel than ordinary Earth rocks as well. You can use an off-the-shelf nickel allergy test to test for the presence of nickel.\nWhen viewed under magnification the interior of a stone meteorite will show not only the iron flecks inside the stone, but there are small spherical mineral inclusions called chondrules that will be scattered throughout the matrix. The matrix is the material surrounding the chondrules and iron.\nTypes of Meteorites There are 3 main types of meteorites. Stone meteorites, iron meteorites, and stony iron meteorites. As the names suggest the stony iron meteorites usually consist of a 50/50 mixture of iron and silicate minerals. There are two types of stony iron meteorites; pallasites, and mesosiderites and they are a very rare type of meteorite and make up about 1%-5% of all meteorites.\nIron meteorites make up about 5% of all known falls, and though this number will vary from source to source most will agree that this is probably accurate.\nStone meteorites (Ordinary Chondrites) make up the majority, about 80% to 95% of all meteorites that fall to earth. They are called chondrites due to the small spherical inclusions called chondrules. These minerals are formed in the vacuum and zero gravity environment in space, hence the reason for their shape.\nFreshly fallen meteorites will also exhibit what’s called fusion crust. This is a thin veneer of black material that is formed on the surface of the stone as the meteoroid enters our atmosphere. Usually this dark black fusion crust looks very much like charcoal on the outside, and if a meteorite is a stone type then they typically have a lighter colored stone interior that looks much like concrete.\nThumbprints Another very important indicator that a stone might be a meteorite are regmaglypts, or thumbprints. These are indentations, ridges, scoops, and depressions on the surface of the meteorite formed through a process called ablation. This happens while the meteoroid passes through our atmosphere.\nThe extremely high temperatures that the meteoroid endures melts away less dense material from the surface of the stone and this creates the rounded curves and depressions known as thumbprints. Thumbprints are called such because the human thumb usually fits nicely in these depressions.\nWhat if I think I have a Meteorite? There is much more to identifying meteorites than simply using the techniques mentioned here, but if you have a stone that meets all the characteristics then you just might have a meteorite.\nThe best thing to do would be to contact a university like ASU (Arizona State University) or a meteorite expert which can identify meteorites. There are lots of professional meteorite hunters and dealers online that are happy to help you identify or give you advice on a possible meteorite find.\nMeteorite Classification A meteorite, to be eligible for a name must be classified by a lab and approved by the Meteoritical Society. Once classified by a lab, a meteorite is eligible for a name to be determined usually relating to the place of the find. A perfect example would be the Sikhote Alin meteorite which is an iron meteorite found in the Sikhote Alin mountains in Siberia, Russia. PAGE WITH NUMEROUS CLASSIFICATION LINKS\nMeteorites Are All Around Us Meteorites have been found everywhere on this planet, Antarctica, Africa, North and South America, Russia, China, Europe and Australia. In fact Australia is a great place to hunt for meteorites. Hunting meteorites is one thing, finding them is quite another story. If you\'d like to learn more about meteorites Meteorites USA has a plethora of meteorite information, articles, photos, videos, maps, and even has some meteorites for collectors as well as a meteorite newsletter.\n© Copyright 2010 Eric Wichman - Meteorites USA\nPUBLISHERS & WEBMASTERS:\nNote: This article and it\'s contents are available for re-publishing on related content sites.

65	meditation health benefits depression treatment comparison	Meditation offers various health benefits and can complement depression treatment. As a health intervention, meditation reduces stress and anxiety levels, improves cognitive and emotional functions, delays brain aging, and helps with specific conditions like coronary disease and cancer-related symptoms. In the context of depression treatment, meditation serves as a complementary approach alongside traditional treatments like psychotherapy and medication. While meditation can reduce depressive symptoms through stress reduction, improved emotional well-being, and enhanced self-awareness, it's important to note that it should not replace professional mental health treatment. Both applications share common benefits such as improved sleep quality, better emotional regulation, and increased focus, but their primary goals differ: general health improvement versus specific mental health treatment.	['Meditation: definition and techniques\nMeditation is a practice where an individual trains the mind or induces a mode of consciousness. The term “meditation” derives from the Sanskrit word dhyana, which means attention and contemplation. Meditation includes a large variety of activities with or without spiritual and religious connections, and is designed to promote relaxation, build internal energy and develop compassion, love, patience, generosity and forgiveness. There are different kinds of meditation: they all include mental activity, emphasizing on religion, spirituality or concentration, however, some approaches also incorporate diet or movement (e.g. ayurveda, yoga). Transcendental and mindfulness meditations are two of the most popular meditation techniques. Transcendental meditation involves the use of a mantra; it is performed in sitting position with eyes closed twice per day for 15-20 minutes. Conversely, mindfulness meditation pays attention to the movement of the abdomen during breathing; it is practiced in sitting position with eyes closed, legs crossed, on a pad or on a chair and with straight back.\nThe health benefits of meditation\nThe practice of meditation is increasing among people who want to cure stress-related conditions, as well as to promote general health. Moreover, the interest in these benefits is growing among researchers who study the integration of this practice with medicine.\nFirstly, meditation induces a state of relaxation, which reduces the stress and anxiety levels, therefore improving the general health condition. In fact, meditation determines a reduction of heart rate and oxygen consumption, with a decrease of pH and arterial lactate. Moreover, meditation produces an increase in the galvanic resistance of the skin and a predominance of alpha waves, produced during the state of relaxation.\nBrain Aging Delay\nSecondly, the regular practice of meditation suggests potential improvement in cognitive and emotional functions able to delay brain aging. The regular practice of meditation seems to modify brain activity and to induce structural alterations in specific areas of the brain. In fact, meditators present larger thickness of the cerebral cortex and a higher volume of gray matter in the brain regions associated with processes of learning, memory, regulation of emotions and emphatic capacity.\nRelief from Ailments\nThirdly, meditation also shows benefits in some disease conditions. For example, meditation improves the regulation of mean arterial pressure in patients with coronary disease, reducing the risk of mortality, myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident. In patients diagnosed with cancer, meditation alleviates the physical and emotional adverse effects of the medical treatments. Similar benefits have also been observed in patients who have undergone organ transplantation. Elderly people benefit from meditation with improvement in sleep quality. Moreover, pain can be reduced with the practice of meditation.\nIn spite of the benefits, meditation may nonetheless cause adverse effects such depersonalization and de-realization. Therefore, it is not recommended for individuals with borderline or psychotic conditions.\nIn conclusion, meditation is a mental training able to modify the function of the brain and mind in favor of attention skills, cognitive capacity and emotional regulation, improving the response capacity to every day stressor stimuli.\n- Goyal M, Singh S, Sibinga EM, Gould NF, Rowland-Seymour A, Sharma R, Berger Z, Sleicher D, Maron DD, Shihab HM, Ranasinghe PD, Linn S, Saha S, Bass EB, Haythornthwaite JA.

PubMed PMID: 26915053\n- JAMA Internal Medicine\n- J Relig Health', 'Depression is a mental health disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest or pleasure in activities. It goes beyond temporary feelings of sadness that everyone experiences from time to time. Depression affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves, and it can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems.\nThe symptoms of depression can vary from person to person, but some common signs include:\nPersistent sadness or emptiness\nLoss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed\nChanges in appetite and weight (either significant weight loss or weight gain)\nDifficulty sleeping or sleeping too much\nRestlessness or irritability\nFatigue or loss of energy\nFeelings of worthlessness, guilt, or hopelessness\nDifficulty concentrating or making decisions\nThoughts of death or suicide\nDepression can be caused by a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. It is a complex condition, and the exact causes can vary from person to person. Some common risk factors for depression include a family history of the disorder, certain medical conditions, traumatic life events, chronic stress, and certain medications.\nIt is important to note that depression is a treatable condition. Treatment options may include psychotherapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy), medication (such as antidepressant medications), or a combination of both. Lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise, maintaining a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep, can also be beneficial in managing depression.\nMeditation can be a helpful tool in managing and reducing symptoms of depression. Here are some of the benefits that meditation can offer:\nStress reduction: Meditation has been shown to reduce stress levels by activating the body’s relaxation response. This can help alleviate the physical and emotional symptoms of stress that often accompany depression.\nImproved emotional well-being: Regular meditation practice can enhance emotional well-being by increasing positive emotions and reducing negative emotions. It can promote feelings of calmness, inner peace, and contentment, which can be particularly beneficial for individuals struggling with depression.\nIncreased self-awareness: Meditation cultivates a sense of self-awareness, allowing individuals to observe their thoughts and emotions without judgment. This heightened self-awareness can help identify negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to depression, enabling individuals to develop healthier coping mechanisms.\nEnhanced focus and concentration: Depression often affects concentration and cognitive function. Meditation practices, such as mindfulness meditation, can improve focus and concentration by training the mind to stay present and redirect attention to the present moment. This can help counteract the cognitive difficulties associated with depression.\nRegulation of mood: Regular meditation practice has been shown to positively impact mood regulation. It can help individuals develop skills to navigate and regulate their emotions, reducing the intensity and duration of depressive episodes.\nImproved sleep: Depression can disrupt sleep patterns, leading to insomnia or excessive sleep. Meditation techniques, such as progressive muscle relaxation or guided imagery, can promote relaxation and better sleep quality, which can indirectly alleviate depressive symptoms.\nIncreased self-compassion: Depression often involves self-critical thoughts and feelings of low self-worth. Meditation practices, such as loving-kindness meditation, can foster self-compassion and self-acceptance. This can counteract the negative self-perception common in depression and promote a more positive relationship with oneself.\nIt’s important to note that while meditation can be a helpful adjunct to treatment for depression, it is not a substitute for professional help. If you’re experiencing symptoms of depression, it’s essential to consult with a mental health professional for a comprehensive evaluation and appropriate treatment plan.\nIn addition to mindfulness meditation, which is commonly associated with depression, there are several other types of meditation that can be beneficial for managing depression. Here are a few examples:\nLoving-Kindness Meditation (Metta): Loving-kindness meditation involves directing positive thoughts, well-wishes, and compassion towards oneself and others. It can help cultivate feelings of love, kindness, and empathy, which can counteract the negative self-perception and social isolation often experienced in depression.\nTranscendental Meditation (TM): TM is a form of meditation that involves the use of a mantra, a specific word or sound, repeated silently to oneself. It aims to quiet the mind and access deeper levels of consciousness. TM has been found to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety and improve overall well-being.\nYoga and Yoga Nidra: Yoga combines physical postures, breath control, and meditation to promote relaxation, flexibility, and mental clarity. It can help alleviate symptoms of depression by reducing stress, improving mood, and enhancing self-awareness. Yoga Nidra, also known as “yogic sleep,” is a guided meditation technique that promotes deep relaxation and can be particularly helpful for individuals with depression-related sleep disturbances.\nBreath-focused Meditation: This type of meditation involves focusing on the breath as a point of concentration. It can help bring the mind to the present moment, reduce rumination on negative thoughts, and induce a state of calmness and relaxation.\nBody Scan Meditation: Body scan meditation involves systematically directing attention to different parts of the body, noticing physical sensations without judgment. It can promote relaxation, body awareness, and release tension, which can be beneficial for individuals with depression-related physical symptoms or somatic complaints.\nWalking Meditation: Walking meditation involves bringing mindfulness and awareness to the experience of walking. It can be done indoors or outdoors and can help promote relaxation, grounding, and a sense of connection with the body and the environment. Walking meditation can be particularly useful for individuals who find it challenging to sit still for traditional meditation practices.\nIt’s important to remember that different types of meditation work for different individuals, and it may be helpful to explore and experiment with different techniques to find what resonates best with you. It is also recommended to learn meditation techniques from qualified instructors or through guided meditation resources such as books, apps, or online programs.']	['<urn:uuid:8b94d918-e7a5-4d54-a870-b50ec429cb1c>', '<urn:uuid:76f248bd-2697-43e4-b96e-77d227b79446>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	6	115	1535
66	what are symptoms lung cancer	Lung cancer symptoms include shortness of breath, a lingering cough, changes in a chronic cough, coughing up blood, chest pain, weight loss, bone pain, and fluid in chest. However, it's important to note that lung cancer often does not cause symptoms in the very early stages.	['Lung Cancer Defined\nLung Cancer develops from the growth of abnormal cells in one or both lungs, which can interfere with lung function or form tumors.\nTypes of Lung Cancer\nThere are two main types of Lung Cancer: Small Cell Lung Cancer and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.\nSmall Cell Lung Cancer: Small Cell Lung Cancer accounts for a small percentage of lung cancers. Small Cell Lung Cancer grows and spreads more quickly to other parts of the body sooner than Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.\nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer is the most common type of Lung Cancer and can be comprised of one of the following types of tumors:\n- Squamous cell carcinoma/Epidermoid carcinoma\n- Large cell carcinoma\nSymptoms of Lung Cancer\nUnfortunately, Lung Cancer often does not cause symptoms in the very early stages. Symptoms of Lung Cancer include, but are definitely not limited to:\n- Shortness of breath\n- A lingering cough\n- Changes in a chronic cough\n- Coughing up blood\n- Chest pain\n- Weight loss\n- Bone pain\n- Fluid in chest\nStages of Lung Cancer\nThe stages of Lung Cancer differ for Small Cell Lung Cancer and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer to describe the severity of the cancer.\n- Stages of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\n- Stage I: The cancer is only located in the lung(s) and has not spread to lymph nodes.\n- Stage II: The cancer is located in the lung(s) and nearby lymph nodes.\n- Stage IIIA: The cancer is located in the lung(s) and the lymph nodes in the middle of the chest on the same side of the chest where the cancer started.\n- Stage IIIB: The cancer is located in the lung(s) and the lymph nodes in the middle of the chest on the opposite side of the chest where the cancer started, or above the collarbone.\n- Stages of Small Cell Lung Cancer\n- Limited Stage: The cancer is located on one side of the chest in part of one lung and the nearby lymph nodes.\n- Extensive Stage: The cancer has spread to other parts of the chest or body.\nPlease note that the content contained herein was not prepared by medical professionals and should not be construed as medical advice. Please address all medical questions, concerns, and symptoms with your doctor.\nDiagnosing Lung Cancer\nThe best way to ascertain appropriate treatment is through quick diagnosis of the disease. Survival time relies on rapid diagnosis and immediate treatment.\nThere are various forms of tests available to screen for Lung Cancer. They include, but may not be limited to the following:\n- Sputum Cytology: A Sputum Cytology is where the sputum (mucus) coughed up is analyzed under a microscope to look for lung cancer cells.\n- X-Ray: An X-ray is an image of the lungs that could show an abnormal mass or nodule.\n- CT Scan: A CT Scan allows doctors to see small lesions in the lungs that may not be visible on an X-ray.\n- Biopsy: A biopsy is a procedure where a doctor will remove a sample of tissue or fluid from the body that is then examined under a microscope to see if it is cancerous. In the case of Lung Cancer, a biopsy can be performed via a bronchoscopy, a mediastinoscopy, or a needle biopsy.\nSurvival of Lung Cancer requires diligence on both the part of the patient and the doctor. Make sure your doctor knows if you were exposed to asbestos, get checkups regularly, and know the symptoms of Lung Cancer.\nObtaining Treatment for Lung Cancer\nDetermining the right therapies for you or your loved one takes time you do not have. You want the best treatment available, but finding it can seem daunting. Deciding on the best course of action is important.\nWe understand that your time is too valuable to spend hours on research. Therefore, we have compiled a list of cancer centers for your convenience. These centers are designated by the National Cancer Institute as Comprehensive Cancer Centers and are recognized for scientific excellence and extensive resources. This list will provide a good starting point for you to find treatment facilities in your area.\nLung Cancer Treatment Options\nOnce you or your loved one is diagnosed with Lung Cancer, researching to determine your course of action is time sensitive. You must quickly learn about this disease from a specialist and your doctor will run tests to learn how extensive the disease is and will designate a cancer stage based upon the test results. At that point, your medical team will discuss treatment options with you.\nLung Cancer treatment is dependent upon several factors, including:\n- Your cancer stage\n- Whether or not it has spread to lymph nodes or other organs\n- Your health and personal preferences\nThe cancer stage is an important aspect in deciding on the level and type of treatment. This is something you will want to discuss with your doctors so you have a good understanding of it.\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, surgery has a higher likelihood of long-term benefits in earlier stages, particularly stage I. If your Lung Cancer has progressed to cover an extensive part of your body, or you cannot tolerate an operation, then there are conventional treatment options, such as chemotherapy, that may slow the cancer growth, but will not result in a cure. Clinical trials may also be an option, and should be discussed with your doctor and family.\nRegardless of the stage or level of your diagnosis, you should discuss with your doctors alleviating symptoms and pain management as part of your overall care. There are various options to consider, including:\n- Radiation therapy\n- Pain-relieving drugs\n- Natural remedies\nAs mentioned, various treatments are available for Lung Cancer. Here are some options:\n- Surgery: Surgery to remove the tumor is an option.\n- Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy is where drugs are given through a vein or taken orally to kill cancer cells. A cocktail of drugs is usually administered in a series of treatments over weeks or months. Chemotherapy is often used in combination with other forms of treatment.\n- Radiation Therapy: Radiation Therapy is where high-powered radiation is used to kill cancer cells. Radiation Therapy is often used in combination with other forms of treatment.']	['<urn:uuid:d5ffe2a2-a44e-4488-864e-81ba7f54b8c4>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	5	46	1052
67	As a neurophysiologist studying nerve conduction, I'm curious about how electrode types and temperature affect nerve conduction velocity. What are the key relationships between electrode design, temperature, and conduction speed in nerve testing?	Nerve conduction testing involves multiple specialized electrode types - disc electrodes with 10mm diameter conductive gel areas, ground electrodes, and digital ring electrodes that wrap around fingers/toes. Temperature significantly impacts conduction velocity by altering sodium channel kinetics - warming accelerates sodium channel activation which increases conduction speed. The normal nerve conduction velocity range is 50-60 meters per second, with values around 60 m/s typical for median motor nerve testing. Proper electrode design and temperature control are crucial since conduction velocity measurements depend on precise electrode placement and physiological conditions.	"[""US 5203330 A\nA disposable electrode for use in electromyography and/or nerve conduction velocity testing has a tab for connection to a cable connector and is laminated of a plurality of layers including first and second outer layers. The first layer is a backing member with exposed adhesive, a hydrogel layer intermediate the outer layers and a conductive foil layer between the hydrogel layer and the second outer layer. The electrode may be a disc electrode, a ground electrode or an elongated flexible digital ring electrode. The disc electrode includes two identical disc electrode elements having circular portions separably joined to each other at a central portion and the tab of each element is remote from the central portion.

The electrode according to claim 5 wherein said conductive foil layer comprises a silver/silver chloride coating.\n7. An electrode according to claim 1 wherein said central portion is of wasp-waist configuration.\n8. A packaged assembly of disposable electrodes for use in an electromyography (EMG) and/or nerve conduction velocity (NCV) testing procedure, the assembly comprising in combination at least one disc electrode and at least one ground electrode and at least one digital ring electrode, each of said electrodes of said combination including an element having a tab for connection to a cable connector and being laminated of a plurality of layers including first and second outer layers, said first outer layer being a backing member with exposable adhesive thereon, a hydrogel layer intermediate said outer layers, and a conductive foil layer between said hydrogel layer and said second outer layer, and said disc electrode further comprising two identical disc electrode elements separably jointed to each other by a central portion and the tab of each said disc electrode element being remote from said central portion.\nThis invention relates to electrodes, particularly for use in Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV) measurement, and more particularly to such electrodes that are disposable. The invention further relates to a kit containing such electrodes.\nThe invention presents a disposable disc electrode, a disposable ground electrode and a disposable digital ring electrode and a kit containing same.\nEMG is the study of electrical activity of nerves and muscles. It is useful in diagnosis of diseases such as Carpal Tunnel, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Polio and Myasthenia Gravis.\nThe examination has two portions which vary significantly in practice and procedure:\n1. Needle EMG: This portion of the examination is a volitional recording made from within the muscle, utilizing a needle electrode--sometimes with a surface reference electrode--and requiring a grounding electrode for grounding the patient.\nThe frequency of response is typically 2 Hz to 10 khz with amplitudes varying from 20 Uv to as much as 10 mV. Electrodes are moved several times within an examination procedure. Impedance of the electrode/patient interface is typically 15-20 k ohm or more. It is not typically measured nor is any pre-application prepping done to the skin.\n2. NCV: This portion of the examination is an evoked response using an electrical stimulus applied superficially to a nerve. The electrodes used for stimulating and recording are often used interchangeably. The sensory NCV involves stimulating and recording from nerves. A typical stimulus of 0.1 ms-50-75 volts--25 Ma is given superficially.\nThe response occurs 1.5 to 4 ms after the stimulus. Characteristics are 20 Hz-2 khz, with amplitude 10 Uv to 50 Uv, typically. One set of electrodes is usually placed around a digit--either fingers or toes. This electrode is typically designed as a wraparound. The other set of electrodes is placed on a flatter portion of the body--usually at the wrist, or on the foot--and is usually a set of 10 mm discs.\nThe Motor Nerve Conduction involves stimulating a nerve superficially and recording superficially from a muscle. The stimulus is typically 150 V 0.1 ms--duration 60 Ma, applied through handheld or taped on electrodes about 10 mm diameter with spacing of 1-2 inches between; 3 or 4 different stimulating sites are used for each muscle. The response follows the stimulus by 2-15 ms, having an amplitude of 1 mV-50 mV and bandpass of 2 Hz-10 kHz.\nThe EMG/NCV examination requires use of a variety of surface electrodes for recording and stimulation. Current technology utilizes reusable, stainless steel or dampened felt electrodes in varying shapes and sizes. The electrodes are fastened in place with adhesive tape or VELCRO hook and loop connected straps after either wetting or applying electrolyte.\nSome technicians use mild abrasives to lower skin resistance prior to electrode application. During the test procedure gel, tape, etc., are used each time electrodes are moved, which is typically 12 times during an examination. After testing is completed, the electrodes must be washed and, ideally, disinfected. However, with the advent of disposable EMG needles already accepted in the laboratory, there is a growing preference for the remainder of the examination electrodes to be disposable.\nThe primary advantages of the electrodes according to the present invention are as follows:\na. No need for additional paste, tape.\nb. Better recording using silver chloride.\nc. Faster application.\nd. No electrode cleanup.\ne. Faster patient cleanup.\nf. Reduced risk of contamination.\ng. Cost recoverable and controlled.\nh. Ability to be moved 4 or 5 times before adhesive failure.\nCurrently, make-do electrodes (disposable EMG or TENS) are being furnished for EMG/NCV use, but none cover the complete functional EMD/NCV requirements. This invention presents a kit containing the three different types of electrodes typically used in the EMG/NCV examinations. Disposability of the inventive electrodes means that physicians and technicians are enabled to enjoy the convenience of not cleaning electrodes and not having to deal with the patient preparation process. Accordingly, important objects of the invention are to provide disposable electrodes that attain the aforementioned advantages.\nA patentability search on this disclosure found the following United States Patents:\n______________________________________U.S. Pat.

The electrode has a tab for connection to a cable connector and is laminated of a plurality of layers including first and second outer layers. The first outer layer is a backing member with exposable adhesive thereon, a hydrogel layer intermediate the outer layers and a conductive foil layer between the hydrogel layer and the second outer layer.\nThe electrode is one of three types, a disc electrode, a ground electrode and an elongated flexible digital ring electrode.\nThe disc electrode comprises two identical disc electrode elements having circular portions separably joined to each other at a central portion whereby the electrode elements can be used together in a paired mode or separately in a detached mode.

Kit 20 contains two of each of first, second and third types of\ndisposable inventive electrodes packaged in a blister pack 22. Blister pack 22 has a cavity 24 containing two of the first type of electrodes, these being disc electrodes 26, a cavity 28 containing two of the second type of electrodes, these being ground electrodes 30, and a cavity 32 containing two of the third type of electrodes, these being digital ring electrodes 34. Contents of blister pack 22, i.e., disc electrodes 26, ground electrodes 30 and digital ring electrodes 34, are what will typically be used in an EMG/NCV examination.\nAs is seen more clearly in FIGS. 2, 3 and 4, each of o electrodes 26, 30 and 34 includes, in the packaged condition, a backing layer or member to protect the electrodes until use. Electrodes 26 are shown on a backing member 36, electrodes 30 on a backing member 38 and electrodes 34 on a backing member 40.\nEach disc electrode 26 is a double electrode, comprising two identical electrode elements 27 in one, preferably with two circular conductive gel areas 41 each 10 mm in diameter. The rest of the outer surface is non-conductive. Each electrode element 27 is joined to its neighbor at a central portion 42 that spaces each electrode element 27 a controlled constant distance from its attached neighbor. The end of each electrode element 27 remote from portion 42 has an arcuate tab 44 for connection to a cable connector (not shown). Between central portion 42 and tab 44 each of the two electrode elements 27 is disc-shaped. Electrode elements 27 can be used in a paired mode or separated, if desired, along a perforation 46 at the central portion 42 to permit the separated electrode elements 27 to be used in a detached mode at different locations or at different times, thus giving each double disc electrode 26 great versatility in use. As shown in FIGS. 1, 2 and 5, central portion 42 is of wasp-waist configuration, but this configuration is by way of example only and is by no means necessary. In this connection, see FIG. 11 and the description thereof.\nDisc electrode 26 is made up of a plurality of laminations or layers that are shown separated in FIG. 6. To proceed inwardly toward the patient's skin from the outer face of disc electrode 26, layer A is a label, layer B is foam, layer C is conductive foil having a coating of silver/silver chloride, layer D is hydrogel/conductive adhesive, layer E is foam and layer F is a backing sheet, which is really the same as backing member 36.\nGround electrode 30 is generally circular and has at one circumferential location a protruding arcuate tab 48 for connection to a cable connector (not shown). To potect against delamination during use, a hole 49 is punched where hydrogel layer I and tab 48 meet. Ground electrode 30 is made up of a plurality of laminations that are shown separated in FIG. 8. To proceed inwardly toward the patient's skin from outer face of ground electrode 30, layer G is a label, layer H is conductive foil having a coating of silver/silver chloride, layer I is hydrogel/conductive adhesive and layer J is a backing sheet. More specifically, hole 49 assures contact between adhesive on label G and hydrogel layer I.\nDigital ring electrode 34, which is flexible and elongated so that it can be wrapped around a patient's digit, such as a finger or a toe, has at one end an arcuate tab 50 for connection to a cable connector (not shown). Digital ring electrode 34 is made up of a plurality of laminations or layers that are shown separated in FIG. 10. To proceed inwardly toward the patient's skin from the outer face of digital ring electrode 34, layer K is a label, layer L is conductive foil having a coating of silver/silver chloride, layer M is sealing foil, layer N is hydrogel/conductive adhesive and layer P is a backing sheet. To protect digital ring electrode 34 against delamination during use, most of the area of hydrogel layer N adhesively engages conductive foil L.\nFIG. 11 shows a modified disc electrode 51 which, like disc electrode 26, is a double electrode, electrode 51 comprising two electrode elements 52 in one, with two circular conductive gel areas 54, each 10 mm in diameter. The rest of the outer surface is non-conductive. Each electrode element 52 is joined to its neighbor in a central portion 56 that spaces conductive gel areas 54 a precisely controlled constant distance from each other. The end of each electrode element 52 remote from central portion 56 has an arcuate tab 58 for connection to a cable connector (not shown). Between central portion 56 and tab 58 each of the two electrode elements 52 is parallel-sided. Near its opposite ends, central portion 56 has attachment points 60 and may be slightly indented. In central portion 56 between attachment points 60, electrode elements 52 are unconnected. Attachment points 60 add rotation stability to electrode elements 52 when used in the paired mode, at the same time providing easy separability of electrode elements 52 from each other for use in the detached mode.\nTwo electrodes 51 can be incorporated in kit 20 in place of two electrodes 26 without changing blister pack 22.\nFIG. 12 shows a human hand 100 and a connected forearm 102 with digital ring electrode 34 applied to the index finger and double disc electrode 26 applied to forearm 102.\nFIG. 13 shows double disc electrode 51 prior to use with foam layer E adhered to backing sheet F.\nIn the case of each of the electrodes disclosed herein, when the backing sheets are removed, the exposed hydrogel/conductive adhesive provides means for adhering the electrode to a patient.\nThe invention well attains the foregoing objects and advantages, among others. Disclosed details are exemplary only and are not to be taken as limitations on the invention except as these details may be included in the appended claims."", 'What is the conduction velocity of the median nerve?\nFor median motor nerve, the values of distal latency and conduction velocity in males were 2.9 ± 0.16 ms and 60.25 ± 2.99 m/s, respectively, whereas, in females, they were 2.6 ± 0.43 ms and 59.83 ± 2.82 m/s.\nWhat does nerve conduction velocity depend on?\nConduction velocity is dependent on internode distance, with a broad maximum centered around the value observed in normal peripheral fibers. Conduction velocity is also dependent on temperature and the properties of the axonal milieu.\nWhat is the normal range of nerve conduction?\nNCV tests can measure the speed and strength of nerve signals. Nerve conduction velocity between 50 to 60 meters per second is considered normal.\nWhat factors might influence nerve conduction velocity?\nPhysiological factors such as age, temperature, height, and gender are known to affect the nerve conduction velocity (NCV).\nWhy is conduction velocity important?\nIn neuroscience, nerve conduction velocity (CV) is an important aspect of nerve conduction studies. It is the speed at which an electrochemical impulse propagates down a neural pathway. Conduction velocities are affected by a wide array of factors, which include; age, sex, and various medical conditions.\nWhy will your calculated nerve conduction velocity therefore be an underestimate of the true conduction velocity?\nHowever, because the calculated CV is derived from a single stimulation point, it underestimates the true conduction value because it does not account for nerve activation time, tissue transit time, or physiologic slowing (discussed later here).\nWhat determines conduction velocity?\nThe conduction velocity of the action potential is determined by measuring the distance traveled (length of the nerve in m) and dividing by the time (sec) taken to complete the reflex arc, also called the latency. Conduction velocity = distance (m)/time (sec). Measurement of distance is relatively straightforward.\nWhat are the two main factors that determine conduction velocity in a neuron explain how each impacts conduction velocity?\nConduction velocity is influenced by myelin sheath thickness and internode distance (i.e. the distance along the axon between the nodes of Ranvier) (Hursh, 1939), and both parameters are linearly related to axon diameter.\nWhat are the two main factors that determine conduction velocity in a neuron?\nThe speed of neuron transmission generally depends upon two factors: axon size and degree of myelination. Larger diameter axons transmit signal faster due to lower resistance to the flow of charge inside the axon.\nWhy does age affect nerve conduction velocity?\nPatients with older age had longer latencies, smaller amplitudes, and slower conduction velocities compared with the younger age group. The change with age was greater in sensory nerve conduction and late responses in all the peripheral nerves.\nWhat is the relationship between nerve size and conduction velocity?\nThe conduction velocity is proportional to fiber diameter, and there is an optimum ratio of myelin thickness to fiber diameter for maximal conduction velocity. Internodal length is roughly proportional to fiber diameter in normal nerve populations (Hiscoe 1947; Vizoso and Young 1948; Vizoso 1950).\nWhat is the relationship between nerve size and conduction velocity explain?\nLarger diameter axons have a higher conduction velocity, which means they are able to send signals faster. This is because there is less resistance facing the ion flow.\nHow is nerve conduction velocity measured?\nThe nerve conduction velocity (speed) is then calculated by measuring the distance between electrodes and the time it takes for electrical impulses to travel between electrodes. A related procedure that may be performed is electromyography (EMG).\nWhy is the speed of conduction through a reflex arc slower than the speed of conduction of an action potential along an axon?\nWhy is the speed of conduction through a reflex arc slower than the speed of conduction of an action potential along an axon? a. Transmission between neurons at synapses is slower than along axons.\nWhich type of nerve has the highest conduction velocity?\nUp until now, we have only activated fibres in the A-alpha group, the largest group of fibres in the nerve, containing fibres with the largest diameters and highest conduction velocity.\nWhat increases conduction velocity?\nMyelination improves the conduction velocity—the speed with which action potentials travel—in axons. Axon diameter also affects conduction velocity; fatter axons carry action potentials faster.\nWhy does conduction velocity increase with temperature?\nThe primary effects of temperature on nerve function occur by altering the kinetics of channel gating. The acceleration of sodium channel activation with warming increases conduction velocity, while the acceleration of sodium channel inactivation shortens the relative refractory period.\nHow does myelin increase conduction velocity?\nSummary. Myelin can greatly increase the speed of electrical impulses in neurons because it insulates the axon and assembles voltage-gated sodium channel clusters at discrete nodes along its length. Myelin damage causes several neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.\nHow does myelin help increase conduction velocity quizlet?\nMyelination increases conduction velocity by: 1) electrically insulating the axon, which increases Rm and reduces membrane capacitance. This increases the length constant and reduces the time constant.\nWhy is the speed of conduction slower in Unmyelinated neurons?\nMyelinated neurons conduct impulses faster than unmyelinated neurons because nerve impulses jump over the myelin sheath rather than travel through it, making the distance to the axon terminal shorter. This occurs due to the large proportion of fatty substances that make up the myelin sheath.\nHow does the loss of myelin sheath alter nerve conduction velocity?\nMyelin reduces membrane leakiness by preventing open channels and as a result, increasing how far a single electrical impulse within the axon will travel. Importantly this also increases how quickly an action potential will travel down an axon – myelin greatly increases the conduction velocity of a neuron (Figure 2.3.\nHow does myelin decrease capacitance?\nMyelin in fact decreases capacitance and increases electrical resistance across the cell membrane (the axolemma) thereby helping to prevent the electric current from leaving the axon.\nHow does capacitance affect the velocity of the action potential?\nCapacitance affects the velocity (rate) of the action potential. Decrease the capacitance, and increase the velocity of the action potential.']"	['<urn:uuid:802b89c9-3379-49fe-87a2-9701a0331ffb>', '<urn:uuid:3ee24140-b825-4337-94ca-7d32cbef19ee>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	33	89	3833
68	What are the key differences between creating a fore-edge painting and making marbled paper when it comes to the materials and techniques used to decorate books?	Fore-edge painting and marbling use very different materials and techniques. Fore-edge painting requires a fore-edging clamp, sandpaper, permanent markers/watercolors, glue, and gold foil. The process involves clamping the book, sanding pages smooth, illustrating at a 45-degree angle, and applying gold leaf. In contrast, marbling requires a water bath mixed with gum tragacanth, mineral dyes mixed with ox-gall, special horsehair brushes, and specific types of paper. The marbling process involves sprinkling colors onto the water surface and transferring the floating patterns onto paper. While fore-edge paintings create hidden illustrations visible only when fanning the pages, marbling creates visible decorative patterns used for book covers.	['Fore-edge painting books hold a dazzling secret on the tips of their pages. At first glance, these texts look like an ordinary book; but when you fan one of these special tomes, an illustrated scene appears on its edge. This artistic literary tradition dates back as far as the 10th century, and it continues to mesmerize us today. If you’ve ever thought about creating one of these books yourself, artist Christopher Folwell, aka Dabble Dabble, demonstrates how in a step-by-step tutorial.\nMaking your own set of fore-edge painting books is easier than you think.\nTo start the process, Folwell gathers materials including a fore-edging clamp, sandpaper, permanent marker, stiff brush, glue, sponge, and gold foil. He then clamps the book so that the pages are at a flat 90-degree angle, after which he sands them to make them completely smooth. “Once you have finished this stage try not to touch the surface too much with your fingers,” he writes, “they carry a small amount of oil that can stop the stain and gilding from binding.”\nWith the sanding complete, Folwell removes the book from the clamp and repositions it at 45-degree angle. “The more sharp the angle the better the reveal of your hidden illustration once gilded,” he explains. When situated properly, you’ll see there’s a “millimeter or two of each page” that’s exposed. This is where Folwell places the illustration using permanent markers, watercolor paint, or fine-line pens.\nOnce the illustration is done, there’s only a couple of steps left. Folwell stains the edges to give them a deep luster, which leads him to the final step: gilding. For this, he mixes glue and water until it has the consistency of milk and then applies it to the edge with a sponge. Then, Folwell quickly lines it with gold foil and smooths any wrinkles. It takes overnight for everything to dry, after which he peels back the foil to reveal the gold along the edge.\nCheck out Folwell’s detailed post on Imgur to learn how to make your own fore-edge painting.\nArtist Christopher Folwell demonstrates the process in a step-by-step tutorial. To begin, clamp the book of your choice at a 90-degree angle.\nThen, sand and polish the pages so they’re even and smooth. The goal is to bring them to a flat plane free of tears or bumps. Afterwards, the book is repositioned in the clamp at a 45-degree angle.\nOnce the pages are ready, draw or paint an illustration using watercolor painting, permanent marker, or fine-line pens. “Try to avoid anything which will leave a residue on the surface (such as acrylic paint, or paint markers, charcoal etc),” Folwell says.\nStaining is optional after illustrating, but it offers a “deep luster” to the pages. The final step is to apply the gold leaf. Using a combination of glue and water, sponge the paste over the edges. Then, lay the gold foil down and smooth it over the pages. Wait overnight for it to set.\nOnce dry, the fore-edge painting book is complete! Now, when you fan out the pages, it’ll reveal a secret illustration.\nThe post How to Add Your Own Hidden Fore-Edge Painting to Any Book appeared first on My Modern Met.', 'Marbling is an art form developed in the Muslim world, possibly with Chinese origins. Often it has been used to create colourful book binding inside covers. Here is a little history of this art.\n1. Some history\nFigure 1: A sample of Hatip Ebru made by M. R. Kileci. All ebru samples illustrating this article were created by Dr Mehmed Refi Kileci and published here by his permission. Visit: www.kileci.net\nThe word ebru (cloud, cloudy) or abru (water face) means in Turkish the technique of paper marbling. The term is derived from the word ebre which belongs to one of the older Central Asian languages and it means the “moiré, veined fabric, paper” used for covering some manuscripts and other holy books. Its origin might ultimately hark back to China, where a document from the T’ang dynasty (618-907) mentions a process of colouring paper on water with five hues. Through the Silk Road, this art came first to Iran and picked up the name Ebru. Subsequently it moved towards Anatolia. Specimens of marbled paper in Turkish museums and private collections date back as far as the 15th century, but unfortunately there is no evidence to show at what date the art of marbling paper first appeared in Anatolia.\nAround the end of 16th century, tradesmen, diplomats and travellers coming to Anatolia brought this art to Europe and after the 1550s, booklovers in Europe prized ebru which came to be known as “Turkish Paper” or “Turkish marbled paper making”. In the subsequent centuries of modern times, it was widely used in Italy, Germany, France and England.\nMany specimens in European collections and in the several album amicorum books are on show today in various museums. Early texts dealing with ebru, such as Discourse on decorating paper in the Turkish manner, published in Rome in 1664 by Athanasius Kircher (1602-1680), helped to disseminate knowledge of this kind of marbling art. There is agreement amongst scholars that the so-called Turkish Papers has a colourful influence on the book arts of Europe.\nIn the early examples from the 16th century in the Ottoman-Turkish era, ebru appears in the battal (large) form, namely without any manipulation. Interestingly, several variations developed over time, giving us types such as gelgit, tarakli, hatip, bülbül yuvasi, cicekli.\n2. The technique\nEbru technique consists of sprinkling colours containing a few drops of ox-gall onto the surface of the bath of water mixed with kitre (gum tragacanth) in a trough. By carefully laying the paper over the bath, the floating picture on top of it is readily transferred to the paper; thus each ebru is a unique print. To obtain beautiful ebru results, one needs to have a light hand, refined taste and an open mind to the unexpected patterns forming on the water. Patience and a good knowledge of traditional culture are characteristic of ebru masters.\nSince the art of marbling had a significant importance in Islamic art, it is essential to recall the basic principles of Islamic art in order to have a better and closer look at marbling and thereby reach a deeper understanding.\n3. Ottomans and Marbling\nFigure 2: A sample of cicekli ebru made by M. R. Kileci.\nOttomans adopted Islam with great zeal. They tried to express the beauty of the divine in all branches of art. We see them seeking to illustrate mystical beauties in architecture, music and ornamental art. During the period from the 14th to 19th centuries, many religious schools, especially Sufi sects, became a kind of “Art Workshop”, educating students by a master to apprentice method. Due to the modesty encouraged by dervish precepts, many works of art even had no signature on them.\nOttomans have also acknowledged calligraphy as one of the main art branches that created several forms to the Arabic alphabet. Meanwhile marbled paper has been used to decorate the scripts, either as a background or in the blank spaces left at the four corners of a page. This is clear evidence that the Turks envisaged marbling primarily as a work of art. The concept of coloured paper used in bookbinding was as an accessory, and works of marbling art were since olden times framed and nailed to the wall like oil paintings.\n4. Marbling Artisans\nAs we mentioned above, it is not possible to tell exactly when people started painting papers using the techniques of ebru. Although it is possible to find ebru papers in the bindings of centuries old books, these cannot be used to date ebru papers as these books may have been restored years after they have been written and ebru papers on their bindings may have been used during a later repair. Only ebru papers with a written date on them can be used as evidence for their age. The oldest ebru papers dated in this manner are the papers used in Arifi’s “Gûy-i Cevgan” in the Museum of Topkapi Palace collection which is dated “1539, Sebek Mehmed Ebrisi” (with ebru of Sebek Mehmed). Three ebru papers with pale colors are used inside the book, and on the last page the date is given as “1004” H (1595 CE). From the sentence on the first page, we learn that the name of the marble master who has been mentioned as “Sebek” in the booklet “Tertîb-i Risâle-i Ebri” is Mehmed and the papers used in this book are made by this marble painter.\nWe cannot identify all of our marbling painters by name since ebru papers have not been signed. However, marbled paper was used extensively in the binding of books and within the calligraphic panels in Turkey.\n5. Materials Used In Classical Turkish Marbling\nFigure 3: Another sample of cicekli Ebru made by M. R. Kileci.\nGum Tragacanth (kitre): Gum tragacanth is obtained from the trunk of a thorny plant which grows naturally in the Anatolian, Persian and Turkistan mountains and is called “gaven”. The sap oozing from scratches made on the branches later dries and solidifies into bone white colour pieces. It is dropped in water with very low hardness at the rate of 20-40 grams/3 litres and kept for a while. The gum having dissolved completely is filtered through a cloth bag and poured into the basin. It should have the density of buttermilk. About 1 part of gum tragacanth should be added to 100 parts of water and the liquid should be left for at least one night to allow the gum to dissolve. The liquid then should be strained through a cloth and poured into the marbling tank. If it is too thick, some water may be added to thin it. The degree of viscosity should vary according to the darkness or lightness of the colours being used. Gum tragacanth keeps the dyes on the surface by giving body to the water and because of its transparent slightly sticky nature it forms a lacquer over the dyes. Gum tragacanth is widely used as herbal medicine (in throat and stomach diseases) and in the cosmetic and textile industry.\nDyes: The colours used in marbling are “mineral dyes”, as they are called in the classical method, and they are obtained from natural metal oxides. There are also a few vegetable dyes. Anatolia is a very rich country in respect of such natural dyes. Many kinds of soil can be first made into mud then filtered and crushed to form a dye. The dyes are ground into fine powder by crushing them on marble with a specially shaped mortar pestle made of marble. Each of these powdered dyes is placed in a separate glass jar to which a small quantity of water and five to ten drops of ox bile are added.\nPaintbrushes: Marbling requires the use of special, coarse horsehair bound around a rose tree stick in a manner to form a circumference with a hollow centre. Rose tree is preferred because it prevents mould. Brushes of different thickness and length enable application and control of the dye. The length and degree of packing among the brush bristles is important.\nBasin or Tanks: Tanks should be made of pinewood, zinc or galvanized metal and they generally measure 35 by 50 centimetres or 17.5 by 25 centimetres, larger than the paper size (to offset the dilatation of paper when wet). These tanks have a depth of about 5 to 6 centimetres (2 to 2.5 inches). Tanks made of other materials hinder the dispersion of the dyes.\nWater: Water should be calcium free to avoid fading and ozone free to keep the gum tragacanth from foaming and deteriorating. It is preferable without hardness. The ideal is distilled water. In older times, rainwater was preferred but because of acid rain in our times it is no longer advisable.\nPaper: Marbling can be done on all types of paper, cloth, wood, veneers, ceramics, pottery and glass using only mineral dyes and natural indigo and without additives. But the ideal paper is the one that is handmade, has a high absorption capacity and is acid-free. On account of its rarity and high cost we do not advise it for beginners. Instead any kind of non-glossy paper may be used.\nBile (Ox-Gall): This is the most important material for marbling. A marbling artisan must understand well what is gall and what are its functions. It can be said that the secret of the marbling lies in the gall. Because of these solvent-like and adhesive-like properties, the gall that is used in marbling prevents the dye from remaining on the surface of the gum tragacanth solution and avoids dispersion and colour mixing. Different types of galls are used to achieve different results. Ox gall allows the dyes to spread; turbot bile is used to achieve a “sandy” pattern whereas chicken bile stabilizes the white areas achieved with naphtha. Boiled bile will lose its properties. Therefore either fresh or pasteurized bile should be used. Its main functions are:\na. To ensure surface tension so that dye spreads over the water surface otherwise it sinks;\nb. To prevent mixing of dyes. For instance when blue and yellow are simultaneously applied and mixed up as much as possible, green never appears;\nc. To assist dye fixation on the paper;\nd. To give different shades of the same colour and different size of patterns.\n6. The Process of Making Marbled Paper\nFigure 4: A sample of Battal Ebru by made by M. R. Kileci.\nMarbling is similar to cooking, it is impossible to prescribe an exact recipe. Everyone has his own mixture of colours and patterns that he wishes to reflect to the world. The process of marbling begins with dissolving gum tragacanth in water. This water is then poured into the tank. Then the dyes to be used are emptied from the jars one after another using the brushes and are sprinkled onto the solution. Each of the dyes added, strewn one onto the other, produce attractive figures. A sheet of paper of the required size is placed on the marbling container and the image created by the dyes on the surface of the waters is impregnated on the papers. The paper is then removed and left to dry. The tank is then ready for another marbling operation.\nMarbling results from the simultaneous operation of many accurate balances. Purity and application rules must be strictly observed. The density of the gummed water and the relationships between the water and the dye, the dye and the tensioning agent (gall), and the quantity of gall in the dye are all very important. It may take some time to establish the right delicate balance. But when everything is ready, marbling is easily and quickly performed. This property of the marbling makes it very suitable for a “therapy”.\nDyes are spotted on the surface of water by means of paintbrushes and on the basis of the quantities and colours desired. Dyes should not be too concentrated. Concentric, superposed drops thus applied form a pattern called “Battal”.\nThis pattern is the origin of almost all others. Now if this basic pattern is handled by parallel lines made by a thin pencil or chip moved back and forth, you obtain “the back-and-forth”. If this design is crossed out by means of a comb, a “combed-pattern” is obtained. In case the “back-and-forth” is diagonally crossed again, it becomes a “shawl” sample. Combed marbling may be made into a back-and-forth or shawl design. When a convolute line is applied from the outer circumference towards the centre, you obtain a “nightingale nest” (bulbul yuvasi).\nWhen small colourful dots are spotted on the back-and-forth or shawl design, you get the “sprinkled marbling”. If instead you apply larger dots (which means a higher rate of gall contents), you obtain the “porphyry marble” effect which most resembles marble. Nevertheless, the above mentioned patterns may be diversified by selecting one of them as a basis and making concentric drops of different colours. The preacher of Ayasofya Mosque in Istanbul, Mehmed Efendi (d. 1773), was the first to form flower and other patterns which were subsequently called the “Orator pattern” (Hatip ebrusu). Later on, these patterns developed into flower shaped marbling.\nThe sheet of paper is laid from one side onto any of the above designs prepared on the gummed water in the basin. Now, this processing makes the dye fixed on the paper. The paper is then carefully lifted off the basin without stripping too much of the gum from the surface. In classic Turkish marbling, the paper taken out of the basin is not washed off. The thin layer of gum remaining on the surface forms a protective (fixing) coat. The paper is laid on a flat surface and allowed to dry.\nKaya Koc, Cetin, Turkish Ebru.\nSilver, Joel, Marbled paper, November/December 2005.\n[Wikipedia], Paper marbling.\nWolfe, Richard J., Marbled Paper: Its History, Techniques, and Patterns: with Special Reference to the Relationship of Marbling to Bookbinding in Europe and the Western World.

Additionally, certain cyclotryptamine alkaloids demonstrate antiviral properties along with other biological activities including antitumor, antifungal, and analgesic effects.	['Enabling the optimal design of molecular structure for biologic function requires the invention of new methodologies that are chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-selective to allow access to the designed molecular target in a time-efficient manner regardless of its structural complexity. Another aspect of importance is to design such methodologies that also are atom economic - ie to maximize the use of valuable raw materials and to minimize the generation of waste. Furthermore, the development of methods that form multiple bonds in a single pot wherein molecular complexity is rapidly assembled offers the opportunity to reduce step count. Multi-bond forming reactions introduce more structural complexity in a single step and thereby shortens step count. Metal catalyzed cycloadditions has the advantage of using the metal and its attendant ligands to control selectivity, notably diastereo- and enantioselectivity. This latter ability of metal complexes to control selectivity provides incredible opportunity uniquely in allylic alkylations because the exact same catalysts are applicable to formation of a wide diversity of bond types - C-H, C-O, C-N, C-F, C-S, C-P, and C-C, etc., and a wide diversity of mechanisms for enantiodiscrimination. The targets have biological activity mainly as anti-cancer and anti-viral agents. Citrinadin A exhibits cytotoxicity against murine leukemia L1210 and human epidermoid carcinoma KB cells. A facile synthesis will confirm stereochemistry and, importantly, supply larger quantities for further biological evaluation. Welwistatin (N-methylwelwitindolinone C isothiocyanate) is a potent MDR reversing agent reducing the IC50 by 90 fold for many anticancer agents. The serine protease inhibitors, the aeruginosins, have potential as antiviral agents. The cyclotryptamine alkaloids exhibit a broad range of biological properties including antitumor, antiviral, antifungal, and analgesic triggering the question of how structural changes may beget selectivity. The hexacyclic ascidian perophoramidines induce apoptosis by PARP cleavage and the more complicated communesins are microfilament disrupters. The aspidosperma type indole alkaloid, kopimaline A reverses multidry resistance in vincristine-resistant KB cells and has not been synthesized previously.\nSynthesis of complex potential pharmaceutical candidates made easy is the goal of this research. Designing safe and efficacious pharmaceuticals with minimum side effect profiles requires proper design of molecular structure. Inventing novel synthetic methodologies based upon chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselective catalytic processes will enable new concepts in synthetic strategies that will enable drug design.\n|Trost, Barry M; Koester, Dennis C; Sharif, Ehesan U (2016) Ruthenium-Catalyzed Multicomponent Reactions: Access to Î±-Silyl-Î²-Hydroxy Vinylsilanes, Stereodefined 1,3-Dienes, and Cyclohexenes.

70	What challenges face artifact preservation and how do scientists analyze remains?	The preservation of artifacts presents significant challenges as many items decompose over time - for instance, when analyzing a 200-year-old privy pit, only certain materials survive burial. Scientists analyze the remaining artifacts through careful examination, description, classification, and identification processes. They must make meaningful inferences about past human activities by studying these preserved items in conjunction with detailed records, drawings, and photographs to complete the picture of historical human behavior.

This lesson will help prepare students for the park\'s ""Archeology: History Found in Pieces"" education program.\nTeachers should also be aware that there are two different spellings: archeology and archaeology. The National Park Service uses the ""archeology"" spelling, but many archeologists prefer the spelling with the additional ""a"". Both spellings are correct. The Society for American Archaeology posted an article about the spelling of ""archaeology"" on their website. This lesson uses the ""archeology"" spelling, but proper nouns (book titles, websites, etc.) retain their original spelling.\nOpen the lesson by putting the following writing prompt on the board or overhead projector. ""What can people learn about you by looking at your trash?"" Allow the students time to write their responses. Have students limit their responses to a page and then ask for volunteers to share with the class. Then, as students share, start a T-Chart list on the board or overhead to keep track of the different kinds of information that can be gained and from what piece of trash. For example: broken toys = children in the house; empty food jars = diet; old homework = what school is like, etc. Historical archeologists look at trash in much the same way, only the trash they look at is hundreds of years old\nThe teacher should facilitate a discussion about what archeology is (studying artifacts left behind by humans) and what it is not (studying dinosaur bones) and explain that there are different types of archeology. Archeology encompasses the history of man in both prehistoric times (the time before man had written language) and historical (after the appearance of written records). Historical archeology, which will be the focus of these lessons, is defined as the archeological studies of people documented in recent history including early America. In Philadelphia and at Independence National Historical Park, most archeology is historical archeology. Historical archeologists study underwater ship wrecks and historical sites like Franklin Court and Mount Vernon. By the end of the discussion, students should understand that archeology is the study of the way people lived in the past and archeologists learn about the past by studying the things people leave behind like buildings, pottery, tools, and graves\nRefer back to the opening activity and compare the T-Chart list from the students\' writing to historical archeologists excavating and examining the remains of an 18th century privy pit, trying to learn about the people who lived there and threw their trash into that pit over 200 years ago.

Despite seeming like a relatively stable place, the Earth’s surface has changed dramatically over the past 4. Mountains have been built and eroded, continents and oceans have moved great distances, and the Earth has fluctuated from being extremely cold and almost completely covered with ice to being very warm and ice-free. These changes typically occur so slowly that they are barely detectable over the span of a human life, yet even at this instant, the Earth’s surface is moving and changing.\nAs these changes have occurred, organisms have evolved, and remnants of some have been preserved as fossils. A fossil can be studied to determine what kind of organism it represents, how the organism lived, and how it was preserved. However, by itself a fossil has little meaning unless it is placed within some context. The age of the fossil must be determined so it can be compared to other fossil species from the same time period.\nUnderstanding the ages of related fossil species helps scientists piece together the evolutionary history of a group of organisms. For example, based on the primate fossil record, scientists know that living primates evolved from fossil primates and that this evolutionary history took tens of millions of years. By comparing fossils of different primate species, scientists can examine how features changed and how primates evolved through time. However, the age of each fossil primate needs to be determined so that fossils of the same age found in different parts of the world and fossils of different ages can be compared.\nThere are three general approaches that allow scientists to date geological materials and answer the question: “How old is this fossil?\nIn academic, historical, and archaeological circles, A. Dates are determined by a variety of processes, including chemical analyses as in radiocarbon dating and thermoluminescence , data correlation as in dendrochronology , and a variety of other tests. See Relative Dating. Acheulean — A stone tool industry, in use from about 1. It was characterized by large bifaces, particularly hand axes.\n10, B.C. to A.D.

These include.\nHaving an accurate time scale is a crucial aspect of reconstructing how anatomical and behavioral characteristics of early hominids evolved. Relative dating methods allow one to determine if an object is earlier than, later than, or contemporary with some other object. It does not, however, allow one to independently assign an accurate estimation of the age of an object as expressed in years. The most common relative dating method is stratigraphy. Other methods include fluorine dating, nitrogen dating, association with bones of extinct fauna, association with certain pollen profiles, association with geological features such as beaches, terraces and river meanders, and the establishment of cultural seriations.\nCultural seriations are based on typologies, in which artifacts that are numerous across a wide variety of sites and over time, like pottery or stone tools. If archaeologists know how pottery styles, glazes, and techniques have changed over time they can date sites based on the ratio of different kinds of pottery. This also works with stone tools which are found abundantly at different sites and across long periods of time.\nCity of Alexandria, Virginia\nWithout the ability to date archaeological sites and specific contexts within them, archaeologists would be unable to study cultural change and continuity over time. No wonder, then, that so much effort has been devoted to developing increasingly sophisticated and precise methods for determining when events happened in the past. Chronometric dating techniques produce a specific chronological date or date range for some event in the past.\nFor example, the results of dendrochronology tree-ring analysis may tell us that a particular roof beam was from a tree chopped down in A. Relative dating techniques , on the other hand, provide only the relative order in which events took place.\nThe following is a list of some archaeological terms that are used on our website.

Relative dating methods tell only if one sample is older or younger than another; absolute dating methods provide an approximate date in years. The latter have generally been available only since Many absolute dating techniques take advantage of radioactive decay , whereby a radioactive form of an element decays into a non-radioactive product at a regular rate. Others, such as amino acid racimization and cation-ratio dating, are based on chemical changes in the organic or inorganic composition of a sample.\nIn recent years, a few of these methods have come under close scrutiny as scientists strive to develop the most accurate dating techniques possible. Relative dating methods determine whether one sample is older or younger than another.\nDating Rocks and Fossils Using Geologic Methods\nWhen the last excavated trench is backfilled with dirt and when survey is completed for another season, one is left with only the records, drawings, photographs, and cultural material to make sense of what everything means.

In stratigraphy , archaeologists assume that sites undergo stratification over time, leaving older layers beneath newer ones.\nArchaeologists use that assumption, called the law of superposition, to help determine a relative chronology for the site itself. Then, they use contextual clues and absolute dating techniques to help point to the age of the artifacts found in each layer.

Columbus famously reached the Americas in Other Europeans had made the journey before , but the century from then until marks the creation of the modern globalized world.\nIn Alexandria, archaeological sites are discovered in a variety of ways. City Archaeologists consult maps, deeds, census, tax and other records. Historic and Native American sites can also be located through field surveys walking across the ground looking for artifacts. Sometimes sites are discovered by chance by home-owners who find artifacts, building foundations, abandoned wells or privies in basements and backyards. Such discoveries are visited by the City Archaeologists and are recorded with notes and photographs.\nInformation is then added to Alexandria Archaeology’s register of sites in the City. The City of Alexandria has laws that protect archaeological sites so that information may be recovered before they are destroyed by development. Planning dockets and construction applications are reviewed to see if proposed commercial projects could disturb sites.\nARCHAEOLOGY, TOOLS, METHODS AND ANALYSIS\nTwo systems of archaeological dating are used: absolute and relative chronology. Absolute chronology dates events in terms of the generally accepted calendar; relative chronology determines only the sequence of events. Relative dates are established by stratigraphy and by the typological method. The stratigraphic method, which observes the sequence of earth strata containing artifacts, makes it possible to attribute each stratum to a definite epoch.\nUsually, the deeper the stratum, the older it is.\nUsing relative and radiometric dating methods, geologists are able to answer the By comparing fossils of different primate species, scientists can examine how To establish the age of a rock or a fossil, researchers use some type of clock to P.R., Swisher, C.C. 40Ar/39Ar dating in paleoanthropology and archaeology.\nOpening King Tut’s tomb Archaeology is the study of historic or prehistoric people and their culture through the study of their artifacts, monuments and other items they left behind.

71	What specific safety regulations and certifications do you need to follow if you want to practice hang gliding at the park's dunes?	Hang gliding is regulated by park staff and only persons with a USHPA Hang 1 or other agency-approved rating card may hang glide at Jockey's Ridge. All hang gliders must register with the park office, and hang-gliding activity must stop one hour before the park closes.	"[""Click the links below to view information about activities for this park.\n|Accessible Facilities||Sandboarding and Kiteboarding|\n|Education and Events|\nAccessibile Facilities: A trip to the top of the dune, once thought impossible for those with physical disabilities, can now be achieved with the help of all-terrain vehicles. Park staff will drive people who need assistance over the sand to the exciting views of the Atlantic Ocean and the Roanoke Sound available at the top of the dune. Rides on the all-terrain vehicles must be reserved ahead of time. Contact the park office for reservations.\nInterpretive tapes describing the views from the boardwalk are helpful for persons with visual impairments; and, with prior notice, some educational programs can be given in sign language. Contact the park office for details.\nEducation and Events: Rangers hold regularly scheduled educational and interpretive programs about Jockey's Ridge State Park. To arrange a special exploration of Jockey's Ridge State Park for your group or class, contact the park office.\nEducational materials about Jockey's Ridge State Park have been developed for grades 4-6 and are correlated to North Carolina's competency-based curriculum in science, social studies, mathematics and English/language arts. The Jockey's Ridge program introduces students to the environment of a sand dune and the plants and animals that live on and around it. Major concepts covered include adaptations, animal signs and natural area preservation. Accompanying the program is a teacher's booklet and workshop, free of charge to educators.\nExhibit Hall: Learn more about the natural, cultural and historical history of Jockey's Ridge State Park and the Outer Banks at the park's exhibit hall. Find out what dunes are made of, how they are created and how they are shaped. Research the history of storms and their influences on park dunes and on the Outer Banks. Learn about the plants and animals of Jockey's Ridge and about their role in the park now and how they were used in earlier days. Find out more about the various activities available on the dune. Ever wonder where the names 'Kill Devil Hills' and 'Nags Head' came from? Visit the exhibit hall to find out more about these and other legends, including Blackbeard's treasure.\nThe exhibit hall is located in the park visitor's center and is open from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. daily. Exhibits include:\nA diorama that depicts what happens at night when the park is closed and the wildlife comes out to\ntakes over the dune.\nA computer program that allows visitors to see how the rising sea level created the Outer Banks and its dunes.\nA computer program that allows visitors to research the weather at Jockey's Ridge.\nSeveral matching games that allow visitors to match tracks to the animals that created them, dune names to their locations across the country, dune shapes to the shape's name, and leaf shapes to the corresponding plants.\nA display of fulgurites, the glass tubes formed when lightening strikes a dune.\nHang Gliding: Fly the same skies as some of the world's most famous pilots. Years ago, Orville and Wilbur Wright took advantage of the Outer Banks' tall dunes and prevailing winds to explore the world of aviation. Today, colorful kites, model planes and hang gliders are evidence that flying is still popular on Jockey's Ridge. Year-round winds, often blowing up to 10-15 miles per hour, make Jockey's Ridge ideal for these sports.\nHang gliding is regulated by park staff for the safety of participants and other visitors. Only persons with a USHPA Hang 1 or other agency-approved rating card may hang glide on Jockey's Ridge. All hang gliders must register with the park office. Hang-gliding activity stops one hour before the park closes.\nVisitors may take hang gliding lessons; register at the private hang-gliding concession located near the park visitor's center.\nHiking: Both children and adults enjoy climbing and playing on the park's huge pile of sand. Some hike the dune for the spectacular views of coastal Carolina, others for the experience of the desert-like environment. When hiking the ridge, look for fulgurites, glass tubes formed when lightning hits the sand. (Please don't remove the fulgurites from the park.)\nShoes are a must to protect tender feet from hot sand and sandspurs - sand temperatures may be as much as 30 degrees higher than air temperatures. Be aware of the hang-gliding landing and launching zones; refer to the park map for the location of these areas. The ridge area closes 15 minutes before the park closes.\nSoundside Natural Trail: This self-guided nature trail is approximately one mile long and will take about one hour to hike at a leisurely pace. This little explored section of the park contains several different coastal environments, including a wetland area, grassy dunes and maritime thickets. Interpretive panels along the trail provide information on the many plants and animals which call this area home. Enjoy your hike and please observe the sound-side parking lot hours.\nTracks in the Sand: The nature of shifting sand prevents the construction of traditional trails in the park. Tracks in the Sand is a 1.5-mile, self-guiding trail composed of 14 stations. Walked at a leisurely pace, the hike takes approximately 1.5 hours. The trail begins at the parking lot and leads through the many environments in the park. On the trail, you will see many tracks, ranging from foxes and deer to insects and birds. Brochures for the trail can be picked up at the trailhead or in the visitor's center.\nIf you prefer a shorter trip, a 360-foot boardwalk is located near the beginning of the Tracks in the Sand trail. Interpretive displays along the route offer information about the plants and animals found in the area. A deck with a bench is the perfect place to snap a photo or sit down and enjoy nature.\nThe town of Nags Head and Jockey's Ridge State Park operate an estuarine access at the base of the dune along Roanoke Sound. Facilities include two dune crossovers and informational panels about this special environment.\nPicnicking: A hike to the top of the ridge can work up an appetite! The picnic area adjacent to the parking lot offers a break from the relentless wind, sun and sand. Eight picnic shelters are spaced among small dunes with low-growing vegetation. Each shelter has two tables and a grill. Drinking water and restrooms are located nearby. Use of the shelters is free unless reservations are requested.\nSandboarding and Kiteboarding: Work on your tan in the sunning area of the estuarine access at the base of the dune along Roanoke Sound or let the wind be your guide as you enjoy kiteboarding. There's also a designated site for sandboarding, which is allowed October 1 through March 31. If your sand board has foot bindings, a free permit is required and may be obtained from the park office.""]"	['<urn:uuid:5591624f-507f-4a9a-a395-e0a65841d994>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	22	46	1140
72	belly button bulge babies treatment surgery timing	Umbilical hernias in babies usually go away during the first year or two of life and only need surgical repair if they become very large or if a loop of bowel gets trapped. In adults, the hernia is typically repaired using mesh, while in young children the defect is usually sutured. Surgery is typically performed as a day procedure with excellent prognosis when done as a scheduled operation.	"[""Hernias and Hydroceles\nWhat is a hernia?\nA hernia is a protrusion of a loop of bowel from the abdomen into an area where it normally would not be. In babies the most common hernias are inguinal hernias and umbilical hernias. An inguinal hernia develops in the groin at the level of the skin crease between the leg and the abdomen. In a baby boy the bowel loop protrudes into the scrotum. An umbilical hernia develops after the cord comes off and is an outpouching where the cord used to be. Hernias are usually not present when the baby is born but develop later.\nWhy did my baby get a hernia?\nA hernia develops when there is failure of certain openings to close during development. Normally the sides of these tissues come together and then seal over. If they don't seal, they can reopen and then fluid and loops of bowel can slide into the opening or sac. The closing process usually occurs in utero when the baby's tummy is flat and the intestines are small. When babies are born prematurely and they use their intestines earlier, there is more pressure and fullness to the tummy. This makes the risk for a hernia greater.\nHernias are more common in:\n- smaller babies\n- boy babies\n- babies who have had lung disease\nWhat is done for a hernia?\nUmbilical hernias will usually go away during the first year or two of life. They only need to be repaired surgically if they become very large or if a loop of bowel gets caught or trapped in the hernia (incarcerated). Inguinal hernias usually need to be repaired surgically. The timing of surgery varies. Tiny babies are more likely to have their hernias incarcerate, that is to have the loop of bowel get trapped in the hernia sac. But, tiny babies also have more delicate tissue and sometimes handle anesthesia less well. Therefore, the surgeon must weigh several factors in selecting the best time for repair. However, any time that the bowel appears to be trapped in the hernia, it is an emergency, and the hernia needs to be repaired right away.\nWhy is incarceration of a hernia so bad?\nWhen a loop of bowel gets caught in the hernia, it swells. This cuts off the blood supply to that loop of bowel and the bowel loop can die and/or rupture. Also, in a boy baby, the swollen loop of bowel can cut off the blood supply to the testicle on the hernia side, causing injury or death to the testicle.\nHow will I know if the hernia is getting into trouble?\nThere are several signs of incarceration. Not all may be present. These include:\n- Cannot reduce the hernia, that is get the loop of bowel to go back into the tummy. This is the earliest and therefore the most important sign.\n- Inconsolable crying, pain\n- Soreness or tenderness over the hernia\n- Redness or bluish color in the groin or the scrotum\nWhat is a hydrocele?\nA hydrocele is a collection of fluid in the scrotal sac (by the testicle). If it is present at birth, usually it will go away slowly. The baby usually does not need surgery. If, however, the fluid collection increases, does not decrease in size or disappear in the first six months of life, or is accompanied by a hernia, it probably will need to be fixed by surgery."", 'Umbilical Hernias Repair\nAn umbilical hernia is one that occurs in the navel or belly button. Typically, umbilical hernias are caused by congenital defects at the naval – one that existed at birth. Premature babies are at a higher risk of the condition, but up to 20% of all babies are born with an umbilical hernia. Abdominal muscles remain separated through about age 6 at which time, they should close. In a small subset of young patients, this doesn’t happen, increasing the risk for an umbilical hernia either early on in life or even as an adult.\nIn adults, most umbilical hernias are acquired. Significant pressure on the abdomen in the form of obesity or pregnancy can also increase the likelihood of an umbilical hernia forming. The likelihood is increased if the patient smokes or has chronic cough.\nDiagnosis of Umbilical Hernias\nUmbilical hernias often present as a small lump in the abdomen that is more visible when you are standing or performing any activity that requires abdominal core strength. The bulge may be above, below or to either side of the belly button. The bulge may be accompanied by pain or discomfort. While umbilical hernias have a relatively low chance of incarceration or strangulation, both of which require urgent surgery, younger healthy patients should consider surgery to correct a hernia before it becomes too large and more difficult to repair.\nUmbilical Hernia Surgical Repair\nAn umbilical hernia is repaired in similar fashion to other hernias. In young children, the defect is usually sutured. In adults the hernia is typically repaired using mesh. The mesh does not require tension to keep the defect closed. Rather, it uses scar tissue developed naturally by the body to reinforce the mesh. If there is significant abdominal muscle separation along with the umbilical hernia, your surgeon may suggest lifestyle changes or surgery to repair and correct what is known as diastasis recti.\nRecovery after Surgery\nMost umbilical hernia repairs require day surgery and you are able to leave the afternoon of the procedure. While at the surgery center, you will be asked to stand up and walk around immediately after their procedure. This is to increase circulation and reduce the likelihood of blood clots and/or infection. You will need somebody to drive you home and handle various tasks for a few days after surgery.\nA follow up appointment will be scheduled between 10 and 14 days after surgery to ensure that recovery is progressing nicely and there are no issues of concern.\nProper wound care is important after any surgical procedure and you will be instructed on how to care for your incisions. Most importantly, always use clean, sterile gauze or dressing when handling the wound. No ointment or cream should be used unless specifically told to do so by your surgeon. Hands should always be washed thoroughly with warm water and soap to minimize the risk of bacteria entering the wound.\nPrognosis of Umbilical Hernias\nThe prognosis for an umbilical hernia performed as a scheduled procedure is excellent. Complications are more likely to arise if the hernia is repaired as part of an emergency due to strangulation of abdominal contents. Most patients return to normal activity within 6 to 8 weeks after surgery. Oftentimes, patients can return to work within a few days as long as it does not require strenuous activity.\nWe encourage you to contact us for more information about hernia repair and begin compiling questions to ask your surgeon at your consultation.']"	['<urn:uuid:eb93d364-3f69-43c0-9317-57c650fdf54e>', '<urn:uuid:f5ee899f-18db-4ef8-93d7-2a047971e144>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	7	68	1156
73	I'm new to flounder fishing - what size hooks should I use?	For flounder fishing, use jig hooks and live bait hooks in the 6/0 to 8/0 size range.	"['Saltwater fishing is known for beautiful, colorful fish that are caught miles offshore. That doesn’t necessarily mean that all saltwater fish fall into those categories.\nFlounder are one of the most highly targeted fish in the country, and over the next couple of minutes, you will learn why along with some top flounder fishing tips and how to catch flounder like a pro.\nTypes of Flounder (Flounder Identification)\nFlounder is an odd fish, plain and simple. They are flat, brown, and have both eyeballs on one side of their heads.\nWhile they look like a doormat in most cases, there are some variations among the different species, so we will start by breaking down how to identify the flounder that live in the waters you plan to fish.\nOlive brown on top and white on the bottom. Gulf flounder have 3 distinct spots that are larger and more pronounced than the rest, and they make up the points of a triangle on the top of the fish. They can be found living in shallow water from North Carolina all the way to Southern Florida.\nSwimming in the shallow saltwater from North Carolina down to Northern Mexico, this species is darker in complexion than the gulf version. Their spots tend to be more blotchy than round, and even disappear in the larger specimens.\nOn the West Coast of the United States, Starry Flounder can be found in the mud anywhere from shallow water, to 900 feet deep. These flatfish are a bit lighter colored and can grow up to 3 feet long.\nThe flounder you will find from Maine to the Carolinas are called Summer Flounder. They are lighter brown or sand-colored. Growing to about 23 inches, these fish can weigh up to 5 pounds. They are caught in great numbers near Cape Cod.\nWith a deepwater flounder, the windowpane is normally found about 150 feet down. They live along the Atlantic Shelf, off the East Coast of the United States. These fish are very light with dark brown spots and grow to roughly 18 inches when mature.\nAlmost as dark as mud, these fish are small and never grow more than 12 inches in length. At a near maximum weight of 1 pound, they do not have very much meat and are therefore pressured less by anglers. They are found from the Chesapeake Bay to the Gulf of St. Lawrence.\nWhat Do I Need for Flounder Fishing? (Must Have Equipment)\nGear for flounder fishing will vary slightly based on whether or not you are fishing in shallow or deep water.\nMost are caught in the shallow bays or estuaries, so gear does not have to be very heavy. Because the most common flounder are small, typical bass gear and live bait setups will do the trick.\nFishing Rods and Reels\nFlounder are not huge. Typically, you will not find too many fish being caught that are over 20 inches, and the legal keepers are 14 inches in most regions where they are caught.\nThis, paired with the fact that flounder live in shallow water, will let you get away with using a small, lightweight rod. Using a 6- foot to 8-foot medium-fast action rod will be plenty. Reel size can be anything larger than a 25 (sometimes referred to as 2500) size.\nFlounder are designed to eat baitfish. They lay in waiting for baitfish to swim within striking distance and ambush attack. This means you should try your best to use baitfish-style jigs or live bait. A major key when fishing for flounder is to have a natural presentation.\nThese fish will generally feed on bait that is moving with the current, not against it. So when casting or drifting, make sure your bait or lures are flowing with the current. Also, chartreuse is a great color for catching flounder when using a jig or paddle tail swimbait.\nLine and Tackle\nLine size will be heavier than you would think for the size of the fish. With a normal casting rig, you would think that a 10-pound test line would be plenty for a fish this size. The thing is, running a tandem rig requires you to run heavier lines, and that is the traditional setup for catching these fish.\nMost anglers will run a tandem setup, meaning that they have a jig at the end of their line but also have one tied on a few feet up. Tying that knot for the suspended jig creates a weak spot in the line, which the heavier 30-pound test makes up for.\nGig and fish ruler\nGigging flounder is generally done during the dark. Anglers use a trident spear to take flounder from shallow bays with these tools. This is generally practiced on the Gulf Coast and is a great way to take multiple fish on a single outing.\nA fish ruler is a tool that inexperienced giggers use to lay next to a flounder as it lays still, waiting on its next meal. The fish do not move, so laying a ruler down shows that a fish either is or is not of legal keeping size.\nHow to Catch Flounder (Tips from a Pro Angler)\nFrom a Pier\nPier fishing for flounder is one of the tougher methods of catching these fish. Because they do not move a ton, you have to be one of the early birds to catch fish that have moved in overnight. The flounder feed on bait that swims around the pier pylons, so positioning your bait along with the natural built will give you the best chance at hooking up.\nFrom a Boat\nFlounder fishing from a boat is the way to go. You can sneak up into the shallows and cast out or drift over flounder you spot and have great chances of hooking into one. Because you are mobile, trying multiple spots is easy by boat. You can also put fish in the live well of a boat so that you can throw back less desirable fish if you get into a group where you are catching a bunch of fish.\nFrom the shore\nShore fishing for flounder can be done in tidal pools, rivers, or in the surf. Because the fish like flat bottoms in shallow water, they are easily caught from just about any shoreline in either salt or brackish water. Cast out live bait or bottom bounce a shoreline, and you are bound to catch some flounder if they are around.\nThe drift and bounce\nProbably the best method of catching flounder is the drift method, bouncing your jig or swimbait along the bottom. It is super simple, and you can use either one or two baits on your line at the same time. The trick is to drift with the current, not the wind. Drop your bait down until it touches the bottom and then reel up about a foot, then drift along subtly jigging your bait until a fish bites. Because you are not using circle hooks, be sure to set the hook so that the flounder does not spit the bait and get away!\nThe gigging method\nIf you have a flat bottom boat and a spear, you can have so much fun gigging flounder. Take the boat into the shallows at night and use a lighting setup to spot the fish lying along the bottom. Once you decide that the fish is of the proper size, jab them with your spear and yank them topside. Piling up flounder on a night of gigging with friends is almost too much fun.\nWhere to Catch Flounder? (5 Regions Where Found)\n1. Catching Flounders in Texas\nEverything is bigger in Texas, including the Southern Flounder. Female fish of this species can grow to 25 inches, so they are traditionally targeted in Texas. These fish are also known to be the best-tasting flatfish, so they are pursued by many anglers. Texas flounder fishing tips are to gig them or drift jig for them in the Gulf. The high numbers of fish mean that there are plenty to pursue, so bring friends and family and catch yourself a flounder feast.\n2. Catching Flounders in Florida\nCatching flounder at John\'s Pass or Fort De Soto Park in Tampa Bay is one of the hottest bites during the summer. Using cut bait or live bait in the shallow flats adjacent to the structure will have you catching tons of flounder, among all the other possible saltwater species in these waters. Fishing by the marinas is a great place to start if you are an out-of-towner on vacation or do not know where to start.\n3. Catching Flounders in North Carolina\nFishing for flounder in NC is as good as it gets. Fishing for flounder in Murrells Inlet is the best of the best. This area of the country has both local and migrating fish that live within its waters, making it a flatfish Mecca. All methods and techniques are utilized by locals and tourists alike down here. Once you get your fill of flounder, head off into deeper waters and try your hand at catching some reds.\n4. Catching Flounders in New Jersey\nYou won’t hear anyone talking about flounder up in the Northeast. This is “fluke” country. While some people call all flatfish flounder, these anglers in the cold water refer to the summer flounder as a fluke. Fishing from boats or piers is most common, and the fish can grow to about 2 feet in length.\n5. Catching Flounder in Alabama\nThe back bays of Alabama are home to significant populations of flounder. Fishing piers and pylons around docks and bridges will be your best bet. Incoming tides make for a great time to fish these spots because the rising water brings fresh bait into the shallows where the flounder live and feed. Mobile Bay is a great place to start if you are in town visiting.\nBest Seasons to Catch Flounder\nPeople also Ask (FAQs)\nWhat size hooks for flounder?\nJig hooks and live bait hooks in the 6/0 to 8/0 size work well for flounder. They have a mouth that is similar in size to bass, so keep that in mind as you are shopping for the tackle. Most jig heads and swimbaits will do just fine for flounder.\nWhat is the best bait for winter flounder?\nBloodworms and sandworms are great for catching flounder in the winter. The best bait is always going to be what the fish are naturally feeding on during any given time of the year, so do not pigeonhole yourself by being married to any specific baits. Pay attention to the bait that is in your area and try using or mimicking that.\nWhat is the difference between a fluke and a flounder?\nFluke vs Flounder, what\'s the difference? Fluke is another term for a flounder found in the North Atlantic. They can also be referred to as ""Summer Flounder."" Some Chesapeake Bay anglers refer to Striped Bass as ""Rockfish,"" which is the same sort of situation.\nSo, while flounder may not be the largest or best-looking fish, they are one of the best eating and most fun to catch fish in saltwater areas. Just the thought of filleting up a batch of flounder and stuffing it with crab meat is making me salivate as I write this, so go out and try your luck, have fun, and tell your friends about the tricks you’ve learned!']"	['<urn:uuid:e353c7e0-10e7-49b8-83eb-fc58c0360561>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	12	17	1912
74	I'm recovering from a sports injury and wondering - what's the difference between how a pelvic fracture heals compared to a collarbone fracture in terms of recovery time and activities allowed during healing?	For pelvic fractures, healing time varies by age and health condition, and it may take several months for an unstable fracture to heal. While activities need to be adjusted, complete rest is rarely required, though a walker or crutches may be needed to keep weight off the pelvis. In contrast, collarbone fractures typically heal within 6 to 12 weeks, and patients can begin progressive activities starting with bodyweight exercises, then progressing to pool jogging after two weeks, and finally adding upper-body exercises below shoulder level after 3-6 weeks of healing. Both conditions require physical therapy for rehabilitation, but collarbone fractures generally allow for a more structured return to activity compared to pelvic fractures.	"[""A pelvic fracture is defined as one or more breaks, also known as fractures, of the bones that make up the pelvis. Several organs, blood vessels, and nerves are located in this area.

Bodine, DO, CAQSM Last Updated: 8/29/2014"", 'Collarbone fractures are common in contact sports like lacrosse, football and hockey, as well as sports that involve speed on a hard surface, like biking, snowboarding and skateboarding.\nFortunately, most collarbone fractures are minor and will heal with rest, ice and pain relievers. But even then, healing can mean six to 12 weeks or more of time away from competition.\nThe healing process for a collarbone (or any) fracture occurs in four consecutive stages: inflammation, soft callus formation, hard-callus formation and bone remodeling.\nThat said, here are some tips to speed recovery.\n- Stay hydrated. Maintaining muscle size and strength requires water, and blood also has a high liquid content.\n- Get at least eight hours of sleep a night to help your body recover.\n- Don’t smoke or drink alcohol; both habits can increase dehydration.\nTherapeutic exercise helps to maintain the localized blood flow necessary for quick healing. This therapy can also reduce the amount of motion lost and slow the loss of strength and muscle size, depending on how stable the fracture is and whether the athlete had surgery.\nThis type of exercise focuses on maintaining body weight, strength and muscle.\nThe training process starts with bodyweight exercises. Although it won’t be possible to load the area for several weeks, you can use a weighted vest for resistance or a loaded dip belt to perform Step-Ups, Lunges and Squats. Stationary Bike Sprints or Tabata Intervals (10 seconds, on 20 seconds off) help maintain stamina and cardiovascular endurance.\nAfter some healing has occurred—two weeks or more depending on the severity of the fracture—you may be able to begin jogging. This is best done in a pool to limit arm motion. From there, you can progress to plyometrics.\nThe last phase involves upper-body exercises beginning below shoulder level and using tubing or bands. After three to six weeks of healing, you can add range weights and increase the load.\nCollarbone Recovery Treatment\n1. PRP. Athletes who have undergone surgery sometimes try injections of Platelet-Rich Plasma to hasten recovery. PRP is the patient’s own blood plasma that has been fortified with platelets. Platelets are known for their importance in clotting blood, but they also contain hundreds of proteins called growth factors, which are important in the healing of injuries. PRP has shown some promise in treating fractures.\n2. Bone stimulation. Bone stimulators are devices that give off low electrical currents. They come in various forms and are used to assist or speed the formation of bone or union of new bone to old bone after a fusion surgery.\n3. Electrical stimulation. Most of the time, electrical stimulation units are used for fractures that have failed to heal, especially in the tibia or in patients who have had spinal fusions (the surgery Peyton Manning had not too long ago). These devices have shown their best promise in these patients.\n4. Ultrasound. Several laboratory studies show that the use of LIPUS (low intensity pulsed ultrasound) can accelerate the healing process by influencing all four stages of healing. Specifically, the mechanical stresses resulting from the ultrasonic waves change the function of various cells and molecules involved in the healing process. This has been shown to work best early in the healing process.']"	['<urn:uuid:32503a0b-5c5f-40c2-a434-c4d59f91fe8b>', '<urn:uuid:8e23dc85-f882-4f43-a211-8ddd7a21cc22>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	33	113	1152
75	How do art therapy and music therapy differ in their approaches to helping patients who have difficulty expressing themselves verbally?	In art therapy, non-verbal expression is facilitated through imagery and metaphor in arts-based interventions, which can be particularly effective with diverse cultures facing language barriers. Music therapy provides avenues for communication through musical involvement like creating, singing, moving to, and listening to music, helping clients who find it difficult to express themselves in words to communicate their feelings and strengthen their abilities.

The scope of the work could include the creation of instructional manuals, videotapes, or CD-ROM's; categorization of patient art; collaborative community art projects; or other similar projects.\nThe student completes important research appropriate to the field of Art Therapy."", 'What is Music Therapy?\nMusic Therapy is the clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship by a credentialed professional who has completed an approved music therapy program.\nMusic Therapy is an established health profession in which music is used within a therapeutic relationship to address physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs of individuals. After assessing the strengths and needs of each client, the qualified music therapist provides the indicated treatment including creating, singing, moving to, and/or listening to music. Through musical involvement in the therapeutic context, clients\' abilities are strengthened and transferred to other areas of their lives. Music therapy also provides avenues for communication that can be helpful to those who find it difficult to express themselves in words. Research in music therapy supports its effectiveness in many areas such as: overall physical rehabilitation and facilitating movement, increasing people\'s motivation to become engaged in their treatment, providing emotional support for clients and their families, and providing an outlet for expression of feelings.\nWhat Music Therapy Is... and Is Not\nThe American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) supports music for all and applauds the efforts of individuals who share their music-making and time; we say the more music the better! But clinical music therapy is the only professional, research-based discipline that actively applies supportive science to the creative, emotional, and energizing experiences of music for health treatment and educational goals. Below are a few important facts about music therapy and the credentialed music therapists who practice it:\n- Music therapists must have a bachelor’s degree or higher in music therapy from one of AMTA’s 72 approved colleges and universities, including 1200 hours of clinical training.\n- Music therapists must hold the MT-BC credential, issued through the Certification Board for Music Therapists, which protects the public by ensuring competent practice and requiring continuing education. Some states also require licensure for board-certified music therapists.\n- Music Therapy is an evidence-based health profession with a strong research foundation.\n- Music Therapy degrees require knowledge in psychology, medicine, and music.\nThese examples of therapeutic music are noteworthy, but are not clinical music therapy:\n- A person with Alzheimer’s listening to an iPod with headphones of his/her favorite songs\n- Groups such as Bedside Musicians, Musicians on Call, Music Practitioners, Sound Healers, and Music Thanatologists\n- Celebrities performing at hospitals and/or schools\n- A piano player in the lobby of a hospital\n- Nurses playing background music for patients\n- Artists in residence\n- Arts educators\n- A high school student playing guitar in a nursing home\n- A choir singing on the pediatric floor of a hospital\nFinally, here are examples what credentialed music therapists do:\n- Work with Congresswoman Giffords to regain her speech after surviving a bullet wound to her brain.\n- Work with older adults to lessen the effects of dementia.\n- Work with children and adults to reduce asthma episodes.\n- Work with hospitalized patients to reduce pain.\n- Work with children who have autism to improve communication capabilities.\n- Work with premature infants to improve sleep patterns and increase weight gain.\n- Work with people who have Parkinson’s disease to improve motor function.\nAMTA’s mission is to advance public awareness of the benefits of music therapy and increase access to quality music therapy services in a rapidly changing world. In consideration of the diversity of music used in healthcare, special education, and other settings, AMTA unequivocally recommends the unique knowledge and skill of board certified music therapists.\nBradt, J., Magee, W.L., Dileo, C., Wheeler, B.L., & McGilloway, E.

76	guthuk tibetan new year soup dumplings symbolism meaning	Guthuk is a Tibetan New Year soup made with chhaang and meats/vegetables. It includes special dumplings containing symbolic items that reveal a person's character - coal means black-hearted, wood means warm-hearted, chili pepper indicates a talkative person, and glass symbolizes someone who only appears for fun but avoids work.	['By Greg Young\nNorthwest Asian Weekly\nThe Lunar New Year is an ancient holiday that takes the tradition of partying down with your relatives back thousands of years. Here are some of the foods that different Asian cultures eat during their celebrations.\nCHINA — THE SPRING FESTIVAL\nDumplings are a famous delicacy that go back centuries and are a staple of the Spring Festival. Dumplings surged in popularity during the Qing Dynasty when dumpling restaurants were as ubiquitous as coffee shops today, and their prominence has remained.\nSymbolically, dumplings are more than just food. They promote good luck. In some areas, they are called jiaozi, which is very similar to the word used for money, so serving them is believed to bring good wealth. Avoid dumplings that contain sauerkraut, as it may bring a difficult future. Also, don’t serve dumplings in a circular pattern, which suggests life will go in circles, taking you nowhere.\nNot to be confused with the Americanized egg rolls that are typically crusty and deep fried, Chinese spring rolls are thinner on the outside and are filled with much healthier ingredients. Spring rolls actually got their name because they’re traditionally eaten during the Spring Festival. They are also symbolic of wealth, due to their shape and color, which represents a gold bar.\nLong noodles represent longevity. For an extra long life, don’t break the noodles.\nAnother food representing money, the word for fish sounds similar to the word for surplus in Chinese (yú). Fish should be served at the end of dinner, with the head of the fish facing the heads of distinguished guests or elders, showing respect.\nThis doesn’t really have anything to do with symbolism or luck (depending on perspective at least), but Tsingtao (pronounced “ching-dao”) is the most famous beer in China, hitting the market in 1903. It remains one of the best selling beers in the world. It’s also the beer of choice for Chinese New Year, with sales skyrocketing during this time, though that may change soon. Today, the top-selling beer in the world, doubling that of Budweiser worldwide, can only be found in China: Snow.\nTIBET — LOSAR\nAn absolute requirement for the proper celebration of the Tibetan New Year. It’s a dish that’s normally prepared for formal events, such as weddings and the enthronement of a lama. A khapse is a kind of Tibetan cookie that’s salted and deep fried. The most traditional khapse is a mukdung, which has the length and thickness of a man’s forearm, and deep fried in butter.\nA beer made of barley, chhaang also serves as an important ingredient for other dishes throughout Losar. It is also consumed in massive quantities by the whole family throughout the holidays.\nGuthuk is a Tibetan soup that is unique to Losar. The soup itself is made with chhaang and a variety of meats and/or vegetables. But what makes this soup unique is that it’s accompanied with dumplings, or balls of dough, that contain one of nine items that are both symbolic to a person’s character or future. These dumplings are not meant to be eaten.\nThese nine items can be wool, wood, glass, sugar, coal, and sugar (though the items do vary) or they can be pieces of paper with an item written on it that equates to the symbolism. (After all, who would want a ball of dough with a piece of glass in it?)\nIf a diner receives one of these items like, say, a piece of coal, then it symbolizes that person to be black-hearted.\nMeanwhile, if a person gets wood, then they are a warm-hearted person.\nIf a person gets a chili pepper, then they are a talkative person.\nGlass is someone who is happy when there’s fun to be had, but disappears when there’s work to be done. And so on and etcetera.\nA sweet-ish soup that is made from chhaang and prepared on the first morning of Losar, with the mother and father getting up at 3 a.m. to prepare this soup, which they serve to the rest of the family in bed by 3:30 a.m.\nA Tibetan porridge that can also be served as the first dish of Losar. This porridge is made with rice, butter, raisins, and a hearty serving of yak meat. (Beef can also be used.)\nJAPAN — SHOGATSU\n(LUNAR NEW YEAR, PRIOR TO THE MEIJI PERIOD)\nOsechi is a special selection of dishes that the Japanese eat during their New Year celebration. The dish usually consists of seaweed, fish cakes, mashed sweet potato with chestnut, simmered burdock root, and sweetened black soybeans. Osechi are served in special boxes called jubako, which resemble bento boxes.\nJapanese rice cakes traditionally made on New Year’s Eve and eaten on New Year’s Day. Mochi is made by boiling sticky rice in a bucket-like container. The rice is then patted with water by one person, then another person slams it repeatedly with a large mallet. The rice comes out in the form of a nice, soft, delicious, rice dumpling.\nMONGOLIA — TSAGAAN SAR\nBuuz and bansh\nMongolia is unique in their New Year food preparation. The family starts off by making a hundred to several thousand buuz (steamed dumplings) or bansh (boiled dumplings), and they prepare the food for friends and family.\nFood consists of a variety of white and brown food. White food consists of dairy products, cookies, and alcohol made from mare’s milk, while brown food consists of meat, flour dumplings, and other alcohol.\nBituun and boov\nThe day before the New Year is called bituun, where there is a lot of “covered food,” which is made up of items from the brown category covered by a layer of dough.\nSoon after that, they chow down on ceremonial bread called boov.\nMongolian families will devour the feast. You always eat until you are full.\nVIETNAM — TET\nBanh chung, banh tet, banh day\nBanh chung is a square sticky rice loaf that sandwiches meat and mung bean filling wrapped in banana leaves and steamed. Banh tet is similar, but it hails from the South of Vietnam and it’s cylindrical. Banh chung is usually the rice cake of choice for tet since the wrap can endure Vietnam’s harsh weather. The green leaves also symbolize the earth.\nThe origin of banh chung can be traced to Hong Bang dynasty, thousands of years ago, when the Hung emperor ruled. The emperor held a cooking contest among his 21 sons to decide who would inherit the kingdom. The one who could fully satisfy his taste would win. Most princes set out on their journey to find special, exotic ingredients, except for Tiet Lieu, who was the poorest son since he lost his mother at a young age. Thanks to the help of a fairy in a dream, Tiet Lieu cooked two kinds of modest rice cakes made of humble ingredients: banh chung and banh day.\nOthers sneered at Tiet Lieu’s cakes, but the emperor was deeply impressed by the cakes’ special flavor. Tiet Lieu explained that the circular banh day symbolizes the sky and the square banh chung symbolizes the earth (the meat and the mung bean symbolizes the animals and the plants of the earth.). The emperor decided that Tiet Lieu was the winner and passed his throne onto him.\nGio and cha\nGio and cha are two different kinds of Vietnamese sausages that are usually boiled, though sometimes they are fried. Gio is basically head cheese made from pork. Cha is similar, but has a finer texture. They are both wrapped in banana leaves before steaming. These sausages are served with xoi and banh chung.\nXoi is a sticky rice dish, and it is a staple of the tet holiday. Xoi comes in many different varieties, from savory to sweet. There are as many different xois as there are cooks in Vietnam. Xoi gac is a favorite because it is red in color, which symbolizes the luck and achievements for the new year.

77	safe duration cool water first degree burn	You should run the burn under cool water for 15-20 minutes. This is an appropriate first step for first-degree burns to relieve heat and pain naturally during healing.	['Before we discuss home remedies for burns on the hand, we need to determine which are safe to treat at home. You should never attempt to treat a second-, third-, or fourth-degree burn at home, especially one on the hand. Second-, third-, and fourth-degree burns require medical attention to prevent complications, significant impairment, and disability.\nYou should also seek medical attention for chemical and electrical burns and any burns from a flame.\nIf you have a first-degree burn, chances are good that you can treat it by at home; however, we always recommend burn victims seek medical care for any burns on the hand, regardless of presumed severity. There are various complications that can arise from a burn on the hand.\nWhat home remedies can I use to relieve pain?\nGood Old H2O\nThe first thing you should do to relieve the heat in your burn is to run it under cool water for 15-20 minutes. However, you can also do this to relieve pain naturally when your burn is healing.\nNever use ice or ice water on a burn as it can damage the tissue surrounding the burn.\nOnce you have rinsed your burn, wash it carefully with a mild soap and water.\nNote: Keep an eye on your burn for 24-48 hours. If your burn begins blistering, you have a second-degree burn and you need to head to the doctor.\nOver-the-Counter Pain Killers\nOintments and Creams\nBefore you apply anything to a burn, always check with a doctor. You might cause an allergic reaction or worsen the burn.\nYou can find a wide variety of over the counter creams and ointments for burns at the drugstore. These products do one or more of the following: relieve surface pain, provide moisture, prevent infection, and prevent or minimize scars. Check with your doctor, then use as directed, with or without dressing. (Ask your doctor whether you should use a dressing, and, if so, which would be best.)\nSome of these are commercially-prepared, such as burn creams and ointments you can buy in the drugstore, and others are purely natural, like aloe vera.\nOther natural home remedies you can use on burns on the hand are medicinal-grade honey or tincture of calendula.\nDo not apply any of the following to a burn on the hand:\n- Butter, oil, and any other greasy substances\n- Egg white\n- Lemon juice\nNote: Do not apply creams or ointments to a second-degree burn. It can cause an allergic reaction or infection.\nHow can I protect my burn while it is healing?\nWearing a dressing will protect your burn from contaminants and keep it moisturized. You can find sterile dressings at the drug store that are suitable for use on small, minor burns to the hands. You can use either plain sterile gauze or preformed nonstick gauze pads. Plain gauze has the tendency to stick to wounds, but a cream or ointment can help with this.\nDo not use non-sterile dressings such as washcloths, napkins, paper towels, strips of fabric, or rags on your burn wound. These are not sterile, which means they could cause your burn wound to become infected. Infected burn wounds are highly susceptible to developing sepsis, which is an infection in the blood stream. Sepsis can cause organ failure or even death. Only use sterile dressings on your burn wound.\nIf you need a dressing but have none at home, you can use plastic wrap in the meantime; just be sure to tear off the first layer of the plastic wrap roll.\nKeep Blisters Intact\nYou might have heard that popping a blister can help your burn heal or that it will prevent scarring. This simply is not true. Never pop a blister for the following reasons:\n- Your skin needs the fluid contained in the blister\n- Popping a blister can lead to infection and other complications\nKeep your burn covered to prevent popping it.\nKeep Your Skin Covered\nFor more information about treating burns on any part of your body, check out our blog.']	['<urn:uuid:290ab235-f69e-44f1-b674-6a50c641b026>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	7	28	675
78	I'm trying to understand autism treatment options - what is PRT therapy and what are the early signs that might indicate a child needs this kind of help?	PRT (Pivotal Response Treatment) is a play-based therapy that improves key areas of child development through natural interventions. It focuses on four main areas: adaptation to signals, social interaction initiation, motivation, and self-regulation. As for early signs that might indicate a need for treatment, these include: no babbling or pointing by 12 months, no single words by 16 months, difficulty maintaining eye contact, not responding to name, and showing repetitive behaviors. The therapy typically involves 25+ hours per week of sessions where positive reinforcement is used during natural play activities.	"['Pivotal Response Treatment is a type of play therapy that uses puppets and dolls to teach children with autism how to learn new skills. One such skill, for example, might be recognizing faces in photos or playing the piano.\nPivotal response treatment is a type of therapy that is used to treat autism. It includes a combination of behavioral, speech and occupational therapies. The “example” will show what the therapy looks like in practice. Read more in detail here: pivotal response treatment example.\nPivotal response therapy, or PRT, is one of the most effective behavioral methods for treating kids with autism spectrum disorders. However, what is PRT? PRT is a play-based strategy that improves “pivotal” child development regions rather than specific behaviors. It is a naturalistic intervention model built from applied behavioral analysis. Its foundation is the hypothesis that modifications to critical responses would catalyze broad advancements in other developmental domains.\nAt the University of California-Santa Barbara, Drs. Robert Koegel and Lynn Kern Koegel developed PRT in the 1970s. PRT, formerly known as Natural Language Paradigm (NLP) or crucial response teaching, combines numerous behavioral strategies based on research to help autistic children:\n- social abilities\nPivotal response therapy is very helpful in enhancing crucial aspects of a child’s development for preschool, primary, and middle school kids with autism spectrum disorders, according to a research published in the Behavior Modification journal.\nDTT ABA, or discrete trial teaching in Applied Behavior Analysis is another option.\nTargeting Four Major Pivotal Areas\nBy focusing on four key “pivotal” aspects of a child’s development, pivotal response therapy aims to prevent the self-stimulatory, negative behaviors associated with autism. Among these four regions are:\n- Adaptation to various signals\n- Promoting the start of social interactions\nMotivating yourself is the main topic. PRT treatment serves to boost kids’ motivation to acquire and practice skills that have positive outcomes. PRT leverages the child’s interests to encourage pro-social behaviour and spark excitement rather than imposing chores. Therapy professionals use a variety of incentive techniques, such as task modification and alternating maintenance and acquisition activities.\nInitiations is the second “pivotal” section. PRT promotes the youngster to approach others and start a conversation by getting their attention or asking questions.\nSelf-regulation follows. Children are taught to self-evaluate and differentiate their behaviour in this “pivotal” area in order to become more autonomous.\nFinally, PRT teaches autistic children to react to a variety of signals rather than concentrating on certain information or stimuli.\nWhat Takes Place During PRT Sessions\nPositive reinforcement is used during PRT treatment sessions to target the aforementioned “pivotal” regions, which will lead to significant development for sociability. Pivotal response therapy is tailored to each child’s particular requirements and habits. The majority of PRT programs offered in schools last 25 hours or longer per week. For consistency, parents or guardians should implement PRT practices at home. Unstructured encounters are frequent in pivotal response treatment because it employs play therapy to foster the development of social skills Lessons could cover:\n- turning around\n- jointly focused\n- mutual interaction\nHere are some examples of crucial response therapies:\n- switching between one task and another\n- everyday errands\n- everyday habits\nAn elementary PRT session would like this:\n- A parent removes a toy bin full of many items that their kid has previously showed interest in.\n- The youngster is asked to choose a toy to play with by the parent.\n- The youngster indicates the item they want to use.\n- “You want to play with the toy car?” the parent would inquire of the youngster.\n- The kid gets the automobile as a reward when they respond appropriately.\n- The parent may then take advantage of the chance to inquire more about the vehicle, such as “what color is the vehicle?”\n- The parent could play with their own car alongside the child, using the opportunity to demonstrate appropriate play and social abilities during the session.\nThe kid was encouraged to participate (they loved the toy selection), they got to choose the toy they wanted to play with, and they got a natural reward for giving the right answer. These are the key elements of the session. Since parent training must take place in a natural environment, it is an essential part of PRT as an autistic intervention.\nDoes Pivotal Response Training Have Any Support?\nOne of the ABA therapy choices for autistic kids that has received the most research is PRT. PRT has been found to help autistic kids communicate better. The majority of these research focus on PRT provided in a one-on-one therapy environment by licensed therapists. A few others examined PRT in contexts where instructors or parents were present.\nAlthough not all, most autistic kids react well to ABA. Parents may employ this instruction effectively at home because of its beneficial, realistic features.\nRequirements for Providing PRT Therapy\nBeyond their education and license, critical response therapy practitioners often need specific Certification. Providers of key response training include, for instance:\n- educational psychologists\n- instructors of special education\n- experts in speech-language pathology\n- Occupation-focused therapists\nPRT treatment is developed from ABA, hence certain applied behavior analyzers may experiment with it. The majority of PRT practitioners have at least a master’s degree in\nClinical practicum is a requirement for accredited master’s programs in order to fulfill the license contact hours, which vary widely by state and title.\nProviders should obtain certification from the UCSB Koegel Autism Center after receiving their license. With workshops, one may get certified in one of three PRT levels. Attending the two-day Pivotal Response Treatment Conference is required for Level I Certification. The meeting covers the following PRT subject areas:\n- Definition of Key Areas\n- PRT’s motivating methods for teaching social communication\n- Promoting Social Interactions with Peers Who Are Typically Developing\n- Educational Motivation\n- Assessing Functional Behavior\n- Other PRT/Emerging PRT Interventions and Research Applications\n- PRT’s Development and History\n- Autism Spectrum Disorder features (ASD)\nPeople who have successfully completed Level I Certification are eligible for Level II Certification. Participants learn about the basic PRT motivating teaching techniques for teaching communication. This level of certification verifies that participants have adhered to the implementation standards for PRT with one autistic kid.\nFor those who have successfully earned Level I and Level II Certification, the Level III Credential is an advanced certificate. The capacity of the participants to adapt their PRT techniques for teaching communication across a wide variety of children with ASD is the main emphasis of this program. The Level III Certification verifies that participants satisfied the requirements for fidelity for using PRT with three separate ASD youngsters.\nWill PRT Treatment Be Covered by Insurance?\nThe sort of insurance you have has a significant impact on the response. PRT is covered by several private health insurance providers. PRT is regarded as an evidence-based strategy for assisting kids with autism. Pivotal Response Training is considered applied behavior analysis thus many businesses will pay the whole or partial cost of therapy. To verify coverage, get in touch with your specific insurance provider.\nPRT is probably going to be covered by your child’s Medicaid coverage if it is recommended by a doctor. Medicaid will pay for required medical care.\nOverall, pivotal response treatment was recognized by the National Research Council as one of the top 10 model programs for autism. Motivation strategies utilized in PRT therapy helped 85% of toddlers with autism develop verbal language as their primary communication. PRT is an evidence-based behavioral approach targeting critical behaviors in natural environments for better social abilities. As the diagnosis of children with autism spectrum disorders grows more prevalent, pivotal-response treatment is expected to become a leading form of early intervention.\nWhat Can Be Done To Prevent Autism? is a related resource.\nPivotal Response Treatment is a type of treatment that is used to help autistic children. It has been proven to be very effective, but it also has some disadvantages.

She graduated from the University of British Columbia with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and Special Education. She also holds a Master of Science in Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) from Queen’s University, Belfast. She has worked with and case managed children and youth with autism and other intellectual and/or developmental disabilities in home and residential setting since 2013.', ""ABA therapy is a type of therapy that focuses on improving socially significant behavior. It is based on the science of Behavior Analysis, which is scientifically derived and its principals can be used to understand and change behavior.\nABA therapy is the most effective evidence-based treatment for Autism and is recommended by physicians, the American Psychological Association, and the US Surgeon General.\nMany children with autism may show developmental differences as babies, especially in areas of language and social development.\nEarly signs include:The aforementioned behaviors are not immediate indicators of autism. However, if you have observed any of these behaviors, contact your pediatrician immediately for information about the evaluation process.\n- No babbling or pointing by 12 months\n- No single words by 16 months or two word phrases by age 2\n- Repeats exactly what others say without understanding the meaning\n- Child does not respond to name\n- Difficulty making or maintaining eye contact\n- Does not point to indicate needs or wants\n- Repetitive, stereotyped behavior\nChildhood signs include:\n- Difficulty maintaining or keeping eye contact.\n- Unable to perceive others feelings or thoughts via facial expressions\n- Uninterested in or unable to make friends with peers\n- Pronoun confusion\n- Does not start or difficulty continuing a conversation\n- Difficulty using toys or objects for pretend play\n- Rote memory for numbers, letters, books, songs, but unable to answer conversational questions.\n- Insists on routines, difficulty with change, obsessions with rituals\n- Obsessed with (often unusual) activities, repeating them continuously throughout the day.\nIf you suspect your child may have autism, contact your pediatrician right away. Currently, there is no medical test to give an autism diagnosis. Instead, physicians and psychologist administer a behavior evaluation.\nYour pediatrician will be able to ask you questions and use screening tools to determine if further evaluation is needed. If your pediatrician suspects autism, you will be given a referral to a developmental pediatrician, neurologist, or clinical psychologist.\nWhile ABA is an effective intervention for more than just autism, an autism diagnosis will ensure proper treatment is being delivered. With a diagnosis from a qualified professional, we can make sure we are treating the proper developmental deficits. In addition, proper diagnosis allows for proper screening of other developmental delays.\nA child can begin ABA as early as 18 months of age.\nInsurance can be complex, which is why we figure it out for you including checking your current policy as well as alternate funding sources if required.\nWe accept insurance coverage from most providers including Anthem, Tricare and Sagamore amongst others. Our billing department is set up to handle all insurance needs from authorizations to ongoing claims and billing.\nIn case you didn’t know: The State of Indiana issued an insurance mandate under Indiana code 27-8-14.2 to provide insurance coverage for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Your insurance company may pay for ABA. There are also other state funding sources available that may help fund services for your child.\nThe autism mandate requires commercial insurance plans covered by the state of Indiana to cover autism services such as ABA therapy.\nEvery skill, task, and behavior is measured. By measuring your child’s responses, their learning tells us what works and what does not. If they are not learning, then we change our tactic to get them learning. Data-based decisions are used daily to ensure efficiency in progress.\nPrecision Teaching is used to ensure we meet our learners where they are at with all skills, and systematically increase the complexity of the instruction as the data shows they are ready.\nFluency Based Instruction is used to promote high rates of responding which leads to fluency across skills and efficiency in teaching.\nNaturalistic Teaching is used to make teaching and learning fun as well as imbed teaching trials into natural environment activities.\nIf you are looking at a center-based ABA program or autism school for your child, come and observe Bierman ABA. See first hand how the proven effects of ABA, with our genuinely happy and motivated staff can have a lasting impact on your family.\nYour team will work with a team of educated, trained, and motivated ABA professionals.\nYour child’s team will consist of:\nABA Therapist or RBT (Registered Behavior Technician)\nA BCBA is a professional with a graduate level certification in Applied Behavior Analysis. The Behavior Analyst Certification Board certifies individuals as a Board Certified Behavior Analyst. A behavior analyst will help you to clearly define the strengths and learning needs of your child. Your behavior analyst will address those needs using research-based methodologies.\nOur BCBAs keep very small caseloads in order to deliver individualized treatment. In addition, our BCBAs are lead by a clinical leadership team to help make data-based decisions to keep your child progressing in the most efficient manner.\nYour BCBA will:\n- Observe your child's behavior in a variety of environments, to develop an accurate picture of his or her current learning strengths and needs.\n- Interact with your child weekly to assess your child’s language, behavior, social interaction, and other developmental domains.\n- train family members, so that your child will use his or her new skills across the many people and places in his or her natural environment\nA child’s success begins the day they enter our clinic and should continue for a lifetime. Our commitment to family training sets our children up for success in our center, at home, in the community, and in the classroom.\nOur BCBAs meet with each individual family to train on skill acquisition, behavior plans, and the basic principles of ABA.\nBCBAs not only rely on assessment tools for program design but also listen to family needs and future family goals when designing a child’s program.\nBierman ABA has an open-door policy for outside providers. We are open to collaboration with your child’s Pediatrician, Psychologist, Speech Language Pathologist, Physical Therapist, or any other related services.\nSchools offer a curriculum based around helping children meet goals, while ABA programs design an entire program based around your child’s needs. Curriculum is a “one-size fits all” model used to teach children. While curriculum may take into account the special needs of a learner, it is a pre-designed with pre-determined goals and teaching methods. Curriculum is created before the teachers even meet the child. On the other hand, ABA is a completely individualized program. A number of assessments are done to design not only individualized goals for your child, but individualized programing and implementation. Programs are often examined on a daily basis to make sure a child is always reaching his or her unique maximum potential.\nNo, Bierman ABA is not a daycare. Daycare merely provides supervision. Bierman ABA provides an effective, evidence-based intervention.\nThere is no typical day for a child at Bierman. Since we do not follow a one size fits all program, we do not have a typical day. Children will spend the day engaged in learning to help them reach their maximum potential in a happy, well cared for environment.\nABA is designed with all the same elements as natural learning. The difference is that (in the beginning), ABA exaggerates certain elements of learning to engage the learner in the process to offset the deficits of the learner. We will teach your children the pre-requisite skills they need to play with toys, engaged with peers, and carry a conversation.\nWe then provide opportunities for daily social interaction with peers both in our center, as well as natural environment training in the child’s community. We design our social skills programs with independence as the final goal, so that your child can enjoy social interactions with peers or siblings without relying on adult prompting.\nYes, we do provide services in the home. During the initial assessment, we will determine each child’s individual needs and place of service needed in order to meet goals. We may recommend services be performed in center, a combination of center and home as needed, or only in the home.\nThere are many factors that help us make a decision on placement. These include but are not limited to: specific skills being targeted, if certain challenges the child is facing are only occurring in certain environments etc.\nWe also take into consideration the number of hours requested and the parents ability to be home during therapy hours if the services are to be provided within the home. For example, it may be impossible for a child needing intensive services of 30-40 hours per week to receive these services if both parents work during the day. Therefore, the child’s needs may best be met within a center environment with parent training and occasional sessions provided within the home as needed.\nIn addition, if at anytime it is determine skills taught within the center are not generalizing into the home environment, or needs arise within the home that didn’t occur at the time of the initial assessment or development of a treatment plan, therapy sessions and parent training within in the home will be provided as needed to fix the problem. We take parent feedback seriously and also let the data tell us what to do!\nNo. There is no research that shows a child is unable to learn in a center environment. Think about it this way, with that logic, a child would be unable to learn at school, resulting in every child needing to be homeschooled!\nABA as a practice has continued to evolve and improve over time. In it’s earliest form, before insurance mandates existed allowing families to access services through medical insurance, therapy was often performed by parents instead of highly trained professionals. A majority of services also were also only performed in the home as the only option.\nBut as the field continues grow and evolve and more and more states pass insurance mandates, the center-based model has developed and become an option for families. The center-based model has many advantages to a home program, which includes a higher level of supervision oversight and training to BT’s implementing the programming designed by the BCBA, a safer environment for children with severe challenging behavior, access to peers to work on necessary play and social skills, and more contact and oversight by the child’s BCBA to monitor the child’s program and make frequent data-based decisions on programming to faster accelerate a child’s learning. This has been our experience as an organization as we started out only providing home services and quickly changed to a center model with home services available as needed.\nIn addition, as more and more centers appear, research is now beginning to appear to compare home vs. center model. Some research is actually showing kids are making better progress in a center model vs. home only modelResearch: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5621997/\nAbsolutely, and we program different than most ABA providers. The ability for a child to generalize skills is not necessarily determined by the environment therapy takes place but the way programming is designed.\nA common practice within ABA is to teach with multiple exemplars or using a random set of stimuli and then testing for generalization and discrimination following the mastery of skills within the set of targeted stimuli. The problem with this is skills do not often generalize to different stimuli and different environments as the child will often respond incorrectly if all variable features of the skill concept are not systematically controlled for during instruction. The child’s inability to generalize into the home environment is often a result of poor programming that lead to the development of faulty stimulus control (i.e. teaching the child to respond only under a specific set of conditions and not adequately programming for all conditions). The child then learns to attend to the wrong stimuli when responding and makes generalize and discriminate errors. We program differently to prevent this from happening by programming for generalization and discrimination within our skill programming (Tiemann & Markle, 1990).\nExamples of place of treatment decisions for ABA programming: The following are a few examples\nExample- It was reported during the IA the child has difficulty cooperating with other children and will also engage in challenging behavior such as hitting other children. Parents reported the child will also often his younger sibling at home. We would write a program to decelerate hitting peers. Deceleration of the skill will be targeted with children in the center with peers and home sessions scheduled to target this specific problem in the home to build cooperation with the younger sibling.\nExample – It was reported during the IA the child only engages in challenging behavior in the home and not in any other environments, such as school. It would then be recommended for the child to receive all therapy in the home as there is no need for center-based program as challenges are isolated to the home environment only.""]"	['<urn:uuid:0f5ef8d8-f6ec-4272-a884-be3e0ce3c883>', '<urn:uuid:cbcdfbed-d5e3-413e-a8c8-66643b62212b>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	28	90	3568
79	What is the relationship between economic security and agricultural innovation, particularly considering how prosperity affects both social values and farming methods?	Economic security fundamentally changes both social values and agricultural approaches. As societies become more prosperous, they shift from materialist values focused on economic survival to postmaterialist priorities emphasizing environmental protection and quality of life. This transition is particularly evident in Western countries, where postmaterialists have become equally numerous as materialists by the early 21st century. This value shift coincides with agricultural innovation, as seen in vertical farming development. While conventional agriculture requires extensive space and resources, vertical farming emerges as an alternative in prosperous societies, offering space-efficient, environmentally conscious food production. However, its high investment costs and energy requirements mean it's primarily implemented in economically secure communities, paralleling the materialist-postmaterialist divide between developing and developed nations.	"[""Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article.Join Britannica's Publishing Partner Program and our community of experts to gain a global audience for your work!\nPostmaterialism, value orientation that emphasizes self-expression and quality of life over economic and physical security. The term postmaterialism was first coined by American social scientist Ronald Inglehart in The Silent Revolution: Changing Values and Political Styles Among Western Publics (1977).\nUntil the 1970s, it was nearly universal for individuals to prioritize so-called materialist values such as economic growth and maintaining order; on the other hand, postmaterialists give top priority to such goals as environmental protection, freedom of speech, and gender equality. The shift, particularly among citizens living in Western countries, reflected a change from an environment in which one was aware that survival was precarious to a post-World War II world where most felt that survival could be taken for granted. Age cohorts born after World War II in advanced industrial societies spent their formative years under levels of prosperity that were unprecedented in human history, and the welfare state reinforced the feeling that survival was secure, producing an intergenerational value change that has gradually transformed the political and cultural norms of these societies. Survey evidenced gathered in the United States, western Europe, and Japan since the 1970s has demonstrated that an intergenerational shift has made central new political issues and provided the impetus for new political movements.\nThis theory of intergenerational value change has two key hypotheses: (1) that an individual’s priorities reflect the socioeconomic environment, with individuals placing the greatest subjective value on those things that are in relatively short supply, and (2) that the relationship between socioeconomic environment and value priorities involves a substantial time lag because one’s basic values reflect the conditions that prevailed during one’s preadult years.\nConsequently, after a period of sharply rising economic and physical security, one would expect to find substantial differences between the value priorities of older and younger groups, as they would have been shaped by different experiences in their formative years. Researchers have found that more recently born age cohorts tend to emphasize postmaterialist goals to a far greater extent than older cohorts, seemingly reflecting generational change rather than simple aging effects. In the early 1970s, materialists held an overwhelming numerical preponderance over postmaterialists in Western countries, outnumbering them nearly four to one. By the turn of the 21st century, however, materialists and postmaterialists had become equally numerous in many Western countries. The ratio varies considerably according to the given country’s level of existential security, with impoverished and strife-torn countries having a preponderance of materialists and prosperous and secure ones having a preponderance of postmaterialists. For example, at the turn of the 21st century, materialists outnumbered postmaterialists in Pakistan by more than 50 to 1 and in Russia by nearly 30 to 1. But, in prosperous and stable countries such as the United States and Sweden, postmaterialists outnumbered materialists by 2 to 1 and 5 to 1, respectively.\nPostmaterialism itself is only one aspect of a still broader process of cultural change that has reshaped the political outlook, religious orientations, gender roles, and sexual mores of advanced industrial society. Postmodern orientations place less emphasis on traditional cultural norms, especially those that limit individual self-expression. A major component of the postmodern shift is a move away from both religious and bureaucratic authority, bringing declining emphasis on all kinds of authority. Deference to authority has high costs, as individuals must subordinate their personal goals to those of a broader entity; under conditions of insecurity, however, people are more than willing to do so. Under threat of invasion, internal disorder, or economic collapse, people eagerly seek strong authority figures who can protect them.\nConversely, conditions of prosperity and security are conducive to tolerance of diversity in general and democracy in particular. This helps explain a long-established finding: rich societies are much likelier to be democratic than poor ones. One contributing factor is that the authoritarian reaction is strongest under conditions of insecurity.\nThe postmodern shift involves an intergenerational change in a wide variety of basic social norms, from cultural norms linked with ensuring survival of the species to norms linked with the pursuit of individual well-being. For example, postmaterialists and the young are markedly more tolerant of homosexuality than are materialists and the elderly, and they are far more permissive than materialists in their attitudes toward abortion, divorce, extramarital affairs, prostitution, and euthanasia. There is also a gradual shift in job motivations, from maximizing one’s income and job security toward a growing insistence on interesting and meaningful work. Economic accumulation for the sake of economic security was the central goal of industrial society. Ironically, their attainment set in motion a process of gradual cultural change that has made these goals less central, bringing about a rejection of the hierarchical institutions that helped attain them.\nLearn More in these related Britannica articles:\npublic opinion: Regional and global surveys…orientation is also known as postmaterialism.…\nMaterialism, in philosophy, the view that all facts (including facts about the human mind and will and the course of human history) are causally dependent upon physical processes, or even reducible to them.

For…"", 'Agricultural systems around the world need to adapt to the rapidly changing environmental, demographic, and socioeconomic landscapes, and new alternative practices, such as vertical agriculture, may offer new opportunities to accelerate such adaptation.\nNext Gen Farming Without Soil and 90% Less Water | GRATEFUL\nWhat is vertical farming and why is it important\nModern agricultural systems encompass an estimated 1.5 billion hectares of the world’s surface area. With a growing population and resource needs, the availability of arable land is shrinking rapidly.\nSince the agricultural revolution, conventional agriculture has focused on practices requiring considerable quantities of space, water, fertilizer, and pesticides. The past 50 years have seen an accelerating rate of increase in these requirements as modern food production aims to increase productivity in the hopes of addressing growing food insecurity.\nLooking into the future, yield production is forecasted to decrease due to widespread environmental and socioeconomic changes that will generate unpredictable consequences on food systems.\nIn response, many strategies have been developed as alternatives to conventional agricultural practices. These strategies have focused on key principles and their combination to be effective: require less space, less water, and increase yield per unit of area. Moreover, due to the negative effects of agrichemicals, modern practices have also aimed to use significantly less to avoid potentially adverse effects for humans and animals.\nOne such alternative is the development of vertical agriculture, also referred to as vertical farming. As the name implies, vertical agriculture relies on expanding production vertically and not horizontally. Vertical agriculture is a multilayer indoor plant production system that allows for precise control of growth factors, such as light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, water, and nutrients.\nThis allows for the growing and production of crops year-round, completely independent of solar light and other external conditions. Indeed, vertical agriculture makes use of key concepts within ecology and physiology to optimize growing and fertilization within controlled conditions. For instance, elements of photobiology, thermomorphogenesis, hydroponics, and genetic breeding, are all used commonly across systems of vertical agriculture.\nBenefits, challenges, and disadvantages moving from horizontal to vertical farming\nAs a result of tight control over crop breeding, growing, and harvesting, vertical farming provides several benefits relative to conventional methods of ‘horizontal’ food production. This was the topic of a literature review by Kalantari et al. published in 2016 in the Journal of Landscape Ecology.\nFrom a systems perspective, the enclosed design prevents pests and diseases from entering by the adoption of a high level of hygiene, continuous monitoring, and non-chemical disinfection, providing security from crops. Moreover, recent technology has also allowed for automated control over environmental conditions by using sensors and imaging techniques in combination with crop simulation models and artificial intelligence, limiting the need for physical labor.\nVertical farming also allows for flexible organization, with designs ranging from large vertical walls covered with crops to large hangars or re-used shipping containers that can be transported. Consequently, vertical agricultural systems, can comprise many varying sizes and be located within many different areas from the middle of highly urbanized cities to more suburban or rural areas.\nMoreover, the verticality element of this system also provides nutrient and water flow, helping to reuse costly resources. The reduction in space also means there is a significant increase in yield per area, holding extensive potential for a future world of urbanization.\nFrom an economic perspective, vertical farming also provides for more jobs in localized areas and is community-focused by addressing the needs of immediate areas, which in turn can provide food at a lower price. Finally, the optionality of location for vertical systems also allows producers to reduce transport costs, as consumers may access them within urban areas, or transport can be minimized to nearby areas.\nHowever, despite the design, environmental, and economic advantages, vertical farming also incorporates several issues that remain a challenge to its broader implementation as a system.\nVertical farming has a high energy requirement and needs extensive investment costs to implement and develop successfully. Moreover, indoor issues relating to excessive UV, heat, and ozone-induced plant damage may have unpredictable repercussions for plant growth.\nAdditionally, vertical systems are difficult to adapt to a larger scale. They are costly to build and maintain and have yet to demonstrate the ability to provide food for larger areas than community-scale populations. This would make it difficult to implement in areas at higher risk of food insecurity, such as developing agricultural nations.\nThe lack of empirical research on a broader scale has meant that vertical farming has yet to develop past the concept stage on community levels, as persistent issues make it difficult to break through to a larger scale.\nImage Credit: YEINISM/Shutterstock.com\nGrowing skywards - the implications of vertical farming in a rapidly populating and changing world\nAmong the development of alternative agricultural practices, vertical agriculture provides a promising solution for many of the challenges facing current agricultural policies. However, for vertical systems to be integrated on a larger scale requires further technological progress and economic investment.\nNevertheless, gradually implementing more verticality, or combining it with other practices aiming for more sustainable practices may be promising. For instance, the combination of verticality with other practices such as intercropping may be particularly beneficial for developing more sustainable food systems.\nIncorporating technological progress into vertical systems also holds promise, with automated sensors and machinery able to operate near-independently. Progress in gene editing and plant genome modifications will also allow for faster, bigger, and healthier crops, allowing vertical agriculture to produce more over time.\nThroughout agricultural history, farming systems have typically spread over large spans of land, yet the reduction in arable land, as well as the increase in demand to house growing populations, means that such strategies need to be reconsidered, and vertical agriculture may play a role looking into the future.\nContinue Reading: Benefits of Vertical Agriculture and Hydroponics\n- Beacham, A.

80	What mechanisms exist for public oversight of officials' wealth, and what challenges arise in implementing them?	The key mechanism is the SALN system, which requires all public officials to file detailed statements of their assets, liabilities and net worth. These should be publicly accessible during reasonable hours, with copies available 10 days after filing. However, implementation faces several challenges. While transparency is vital for good governance, access is still 'subject to regulation' to protect officials from harassment. Additionally, anti-corruption programs often fail due to inadequate resources, with some organizations spending as little as 0.05% of revenue on compliance. There's also frequently an over-reliance on rigid 'hard controls' like policies and procedures, rather than building an ethical culture through 'soft controls' like commitment to fairness and quality.	['You’ve probably seen “SALN” trending for the past couple of days or you’ve encountered it being mentioned on the news for years now. If you’re guessing it has to do something with politicians and their finances, you’re right. But is that all the document is for? Read on to find out what SALN is and why it’s so important.\nWhat is the SALN?\nThe Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Networth (SALN) declares a public official/government employee’s assets (land, vehicles, jewelry, etc.), liabilities (loans, debts, etc.), and their business and financial interests. This includes investments, cash on hand, stocks, and bonds. The statement includes identifying a person’s spouse, unmarried children under 18 years old, and relatives within the fourth degree of affinity or consanguinity. The SALN also requires officials or employees to declare their relatives in government service.\nWhat is the purpose of the SALN?\nA person’s SALN is a detailed document of a person’s assets, liabilities, and other finances.\nIt includes information on their extended family, some of whom might be government officials too. Aside from that, a public official’s SALN can be used by the court, officials, or other political opponents to see if they have any “unexplained wealth.” This could mean ill-gotten money from bribes and corruption or money that can’t be attributed to salary, inheritance, or other legal sources.\nSenator Bong Revilla’s SALN was important during his plunder and pork-barrel criminal cases. Former president Joseph Estrada’s SALN also played a crucial role during his plunder trial which he was eventually found guilty of. But SALNs could just be used as a gauge of our politician’s wealth. A summary of 2020 SALNs showed that Senator Cynthia Villar (P3.87 billion) and Senator Manny Pacquiao (P3.18 billion) are still the richest and only remaining billionaires in the Senate.\nWho is required to file a SALN?\nAll public officials and government employees are required to file their SALN, whether they’re regular or under temporary status. That means both national and local governments, state universities and colleges, and government-owned controlled corporations and their subsidiaries have to file their SALN.\nWhat law governs the filing of the SALN?\nSubmission of the SALN is required by law under Republic Act No. 6713 otherwise known as the “Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees.”\nAccording to the law, the SALN must be filed:\n- “within thirty (30) days after assumption of office;\n- “on or before April 30, of every year; and\n- “within thirty (30) days after separation from the service.”\nWho is exempted from filing the SALN?\nAccording to RA 6713 Sec. 8, “those who serve in an honorary capacity, laborers and casual or temporary workers” are exempt from filing their SALN. “Honorary capacity” are those working in the government without pay, “laborers” are workers whose work depends on the physical rather than business/mental capacity, and “temporary workers” are those hired to work outside the usual necessary operations.\nWho should be able to access SALNs?\nThe public should be able to access SALNs which, by law, must be available for inspection at reasonable hours. SALNs should be available for copying 10 days after it has been filed and be made available to the public for 10 years after a person receives the statement. Any person who wants access to the document should request a copy at the appropriate office and cover the fees for reproduction and mailing.\nHowever, gaining access is still “subject to regulation,” according to the Supreme Court in 2021. This was to protect public officials from “extortions and harassment” from people who will use their SALN against them.\nWhy is it important for government officials to keep their SALNs accessible?\nWhen politicians make their SALN records accessible, this can be interpreted as a signal that they’ve got nothing to hide.\nWe all want our politicians to be honest with us from the get-go. A questionable SALN can point to a questionable official and we want to be made aware of these discrepancies. As Filipino voters, we have an obligation to scrutinize public officials and make sure they’re serving the country with integrity, not using their power for personal gain. And if they hesitate to make their SALN public out of fear of others using it against them, what is there to use if they aren’t engaged in shady business?\nBottom line: Transparency is vital to good governance\nAn official’s SALN is just one front that gives us a glimpse of how government officials can handle their responsibilities. It’s simple, really. If a government official has integrity, they won’t oppose being scrutinized via their SALN. And if an official is hesitating or even planning on making SALNs inaccessible, that should be seen as a red flag and we should question this decision. This document plays a key role in good governance — those faithful in little can be trusted to be faithful in much. The more people hide their SALNs, the more corruption they could potentially get away with. Everyone knows we don’t need more of that.', 'By Jeremy Sandbrook, Chief Executive, Integritas360\nCurrently estimated to cost five per cent of the world’s total GDP, or $2.6trillion per annum, corruption is now the third largest industry globally and is growing. ¹ In response, anti-corruption legislation around the world is being strengthened, with a growing emphasis now placed on enforcement and compliance. Organisations not only need to have an anti-corruption programme in place, but are increasingly being required to prove that it is effective.\nUnfortunately, a growing number of anti-corruption programmes are failing to meet this new challenge; the most recent being the French industrial group Alstom. Despite having an integrity and anti-corruption programme in place, Alstom was recently fined $277.3million to resolve criminal charges relating to a widespread corruption scheme.² The scheme involved the payment of at least $75million in secret bribes to government officials around the world.³\nSo what went wrong? Why was it that its anti-corruption programme failed and failed so miserably? While there is no silver bullet to guarantee success, there are a number of common pitfalls, which, if avoided, can dramatically decrease the chance of failure. While not exhaustive, outlined below are the most common mistakes that boards and management need to be aware of when establishing anti-corruption programmes.\nLack of political will and commitment at the top\nThe strongest influence on the direction of an organisation’s ethical compass is its leadership, making the ‘tone set at the top’ the most important influence in shaping the success – or failure – of its anti-corruption programme. This requires genuine commitment. It is not simply a matter of making anti-corruption an organisational priority, but having sufficient political will to prioritise principle over economic pressures. Too often, a blind eye is turned when questionable behaviour is needed to ‘win’ business or meet revenue targets.\nWithout genuine commitment at the top, even the best anti-corruption programme will end up as window dressing. Put simply, if its leaders are not authentic about countering it, why should its managers and staff be? A prime example is FIFA, which had an extensive ethics and anti-corruption programme in place (see Figure 1). Despite this, it is embroiled in multiple corruption probes that has led to the suspension of its long-standing president and seen 23 of its senior officials charged (along with two other officials and five corporate executives) with racketeering, wire fraud and money-laundering spanning a 24-year period.\nTip: A simple litmus test to gauge leadership’s commitment to an anti-corruption programme is to ask how many senior managers have attended the standard anti-corruption training workshop traditionally advocated for staff?\nInadequate resources being made available\nWhile making necessary resources available is a sine qua non of any anti-corruption effort, it is often overlooked. According to PwC’s 3rd Annual State of Compliance Survey, while 80 per cent of respondents had a global turnover in excess of $1billion, 41 per cent had a compliance budget of just $500,000 (or 0.05 per cent of their turnover) or less.4\nIf we overlay this with the ACFE statistic that the typical organisation loses five per cent of revenues each year to fraud, the $500,000 compliance budget above is expected to tackle nominal annual fraud seepage of $50million or more.5 In other words, for every $100 in fraud incurred, the organisation makes $1 available to counter it: a ratio of 100:1. When factoring in non-fraud-related forms of corruption, this ratio widens even further, making the $500,000 budget appear somewhat symbolic.\nTip: While resources are a key enabler for a successful anti-corruption programme, throwing money at a problem is no guarantee of solving it. Just as important is ensuring that the resources made available are of the right mix.\nUsing a generic ‘one size fits all’ approach\nWhile corruption is a generic problem, it has no generic solution. Differences in cultural beliefs, value systems and norms mean that what is acceptable in one country or society (in particular when defining corruption) is inappropriate in another.\nAnti-corruption and compliance efforts traditionally use a ‘factor approach’, which relies on the use of a checklist of actions or components that need to be included within various anti-corruption initiatives. Overly generic in nature, this ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach ignores the contextual differences highlighted above.\n“Without genuine commitment at the top, even the best anti-corruption programme will end up as window dressing. Put simply, if its leaders are not authentic about countering it, why should its managers and staff be?”\nThe issue here is flexibility. An anti-corruption programme needs to take general factors into account, while at the same time, being sensitive to differences in local circumstances. How corruption in Sub-Sahara Africa (which is generally opportunistic in nature) is tackled, is different to how corruption in parts of Asia or Eastern Europe (which is far more systemic) is countered. If an anti-corruption programme does not take these differences into account, success will at best be limited.\nTip: While the basic foundation for an anti-corruption framework should be built around a common set of principles, the individual components (and stepping stones) that go into each of its pillars need to be tailored to meet the particular corruption context faced.\nAbsence of ownership in the middle\nWhile the ‘tone set at the top’ is critical to establishing the foundations of a successful anti-corruption programme, ownership ‘in the middle’ is vital for embedding it. While leaders set the direction, middle management is where the rubber meets the road. This group – more then any other – have direct influence on an employee’s day-to-day behaviour, creating a multiplier effect that places them at the front-line of entrenching corruption prevention. If middle managers feel they don’t own the initiative, the risk of failure is high.\nThis is supported by the results of a series of internal KPMG staff focus groups, which found that a staff member’s immediate supervisor was the first person they would turn to in the event of a potential problem or ethical question. In this context, it was the firm’s third- and fourth-year associates who were identified as being the critical link in setting the tone and driving leadership’s ethics and anti-corruption-related compliance messages throughout the organisation.6\nTip: Given their direct influence over day-to-day staff behaviour and the multiplier effect they can have, middle managers need to be the focus of additional anti-corruption training/sensitisation.\nFailure to strongly enforce wrongdoing\nWhen a long-standing chairman of a leading anti-corruption agency was asked what (in his opinion) was the most effective deterrent to corruption, he responded: “Executing somebody!” While extreme, the underlying message is clear: the penalty for being caught needs to far outweigh any potential benefits that can be gained from wrongdoing. Failure to strongly and consistently enforce punitive sanctions will directly undermine the credibility of an organisation’s anti-corruption programme.\nThe importance of this is highlighted in the case of a large multi-national with extensive operations in Southern Africa. When a forensic audit found its local CEO had acted corruptly, rather then risk an expensive court case that would generate negative publicity, they instead offered him a golden handshake. The message sent to staff (who had all been closely following the case) was clear: it paid to be corrupt. Not only do you get to keep what you took, but you are then paid to leave! While this decision may have seemed logical at the time, the direct result was a marked increase in corruption cases throughout the region.\nTip: Strong, consistent enforcement of anti-corruption sanctions need to be viewed by the organisation as an opportunity (not as a threat), as it remains one of the single most effective anti-corruption deterrents available.\nOver-reliance on hard controls\nMany anti-corruption programmes focus on the use of ‘hard controls’, such as structures, policies and procedures, forms and rules etc. Based on a system of ‘checks and balances’, these controls work by simply being in place. This makes them relatively easy to test and audit, hence their popularity when ‘results’ need to be shown.\nThe downside, however, is that the increasing complexities of today’s business environment means that as each additional risk is identified, there is a tendency for organisations to react by overlaying one set of hard controls over another. This layering effect can rapidly result in an environment where managers (and staff) bypass the system simply to ‘get things done’. Once this becomes the modus operandi, the control system as a whole becomes redundant.\nTip: An anti-corruption programme should be made up of a mix of hard and soft controls. Performed by people, soft controls (such as an ethical culture, competence, a commitment to quality and fairness) are active in nature, and harder to audit. They are, however, extremely effective when it comes to corruption prevention.\nIgnoring the ‘design-reality gap’\nWhile many anti-corruption programmes tend to fail during the implementation phase, in many cases the underlying cause can be traced back to a mismatch between the expectations built into the programme’s design and the actual realities on the ground. The larger the gap, the greater the risk of failure.\nA successful anti-corruption programme requires a clear understanding of both the ‘who’ and the ‘how’ in the design process. The problem here tends to be twofold: first those tasked with design have a lack of understanding or exposure to the realities on the ground; and secondly the ‘design’ objectives aren’t aligned with the ‘real’ objectives and values of delivery stakeholders. The result? An over-assessment of what the programme can effectively achieve.\nTip: Ensure that implementation stakeholders are included in the programme’s design phase. This, and breaking each initiative down into ‘bite-sized’ chunks, will help minimise the residual design-reality gap within each component, making successful implementation more likely.\nInadequate training and sensitisation\nTraining is an area that is consistently identified in anti-corruption enforcement actions as being inadequate. Too often organisations assume that circulating a policy on anti-corruption is sufficient in itself and fail to provide the training and sensitisation necessary to anchor it.\n“Too often organisations assume that circulating a policy on anti-corruption is sufficient in itself and fail to provide the training and sensitisation necessary to anchor it”\nAs behavioural change is at the heart of corruption prevention, training is a vital ingredient to a successful anti-corruption programme. Staff and managers alike need to understand how the organisation defines corruption and what types of conduct may constitute corrupt or unethical behaviour. If they are unable to recognise the warning signs and red flags that indicate the presence of corruption, or are not equipped with a framework on how they should act – and react – when faced with corrupt activity, an organisation’s anti-corruption programme will fail to tap into its key anti-corruption resource: its own staff.\nTip: An anti-corruption programme should include training, training, and more training! Sensitisation and training workshops need to be tailored to specific corruption risks and responsibilities and should clearly communicate that compliance is the responsibility of all staff.\nWhile not exhaustive, the above tips will dramatically increase the chances of a successful anti-corruption programme. There is, however, no quick fix. Even among organisations where anti-corruption compliance is well-established, sustained, ongoing commitment and energy is essential. Anti-corruption efforts in general should not be viewed as static, but iterative in nature. To be effective, a programme must be able to anticipate and adapt to new risks as the organisation and its environment changes. Regardless of this, one thing is clear – given the increasing penalties now being levied for breach of anti-corruption legislation around the world (in particular in the US and UK), boards can no longer afford to ignore the topic – or the associated risk it poses to their organisation.\nAbout The Author:\nJeremy is a global anti-corruption expert with 25+ years combined experience in the corporate and international development sectors.

81	what happens to satellites during solar storms and how much damage would strong solar storm cause today	During solar storms, killer electrons can penetrate satellite shielding and cause microscopic lightning strikes that can damage or disable satellites. As for economic damage, a strong solar storm today could cause up to $2.6 trillion in damage, potentially leaving 20-40 million people in the Northeast without power for years as utilities struggle to replace thousands of damaged transformers. This would be significantly more devastating than the 1989 storm that left 6 million people in Quebec without power for nine hours.	"['March 11, 2010\nShocking Recipe For Making Killer Electrons\nTake a bunch of fast-moving electrons, place them in orbit and then hit them with the shock waves from a solar storm. What do you get? Killer electrons. That\'s the shocking recipe revealed by ESA\'s Cluster mission.\nKiller electrons are highly energetic particles trapped in Earth\'s outer radiation belt, which extends from 12 000 km to 64 000 km above the planet\'s surface. During solar storms their number grows at least ten times and they can be dislodged, posing a threat to satellites. As the name suggests, killer electrons are energetic enough to penetrate satellite shielding and cause microscopic lightning strikes. If these electrical discharges take place in vital components, the satellite can be damaged or even rendered inoperable.On November 7, 2004, the Sun blasted a solar storm in Earth\'s direction. It was composed of an interplanetary shock wave followed by a large magnetic cloud. When the shock wave first swept over the ESA-NASA solar watchdog satellite SOHO, the speed of the solar wind (the constant flow of solar particles) suddenly increased from 500 km/s to 700 km/s.\nShortly afterwards, the shock wave hit Earth\'s protective magnetic bubble, known as the magnetosphere. The impact induced a wave front propagating inside the magnetosphere at more than 1200 km/s at geostationary orbit (36 000 km altitude) around Earth. The quantity of energetic electrons in the outer radiation belt started to increase too, according to Cluster\'s RAPID instruments (Research with Adaptive Particle Imaging Detectors). Cluster\'s four satellites sweep around an elliptical orbit, coming as close as 19 000 km and going out as far as 119 000 km.\nUnderstanding the origin of the killer electrons has been a focus for space weather researchers. Thanks to previous data collected by Cluster and other space missions, scientists proposed two methods by which electrons can be accelerated to such harmful energy levels. One relies on very low frequency (VLF) waves of 3""“30 kHz, the other on ultra low frequency (ULF) waves of 0.001""“1 Hz. This latest work disentangles the problem.\nWhich waves are responsible? Both of them. ""Both VLF and ULF waves accelerate electrons in Earth\'s radiation belts, but with different timescales. The ULF waves are much faster than the VLF, due to their much larger amplitudes,"" says Qiugang Zong from Peking University (China) and University of Massachusetts Lowell (USA), lead author of the paper describing this result.\nThe data show that a two-step process causes the substantial rise of killer electrons. The initial acceleration is due to the strong shock-related magnetic field compression. Immediately after the impact of the interplanetary shock, Earth\'s magnetic field lines began wobbling at ultra low frequencies. In turn, these ULF waves were found to effectively accelerate the seed electrons provided by the first step, to become killer electrons.\nAlthough the analysis has been a long one, the results have been worth the wait. Now astronomers know how killer electrons are accelerated. ""Data from the four Cluster satellites allowed the identification of ULF waves able to accelerate electrons,"" says Malcolm Dunlop, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Didcot (UK) and co-author of this study.\nThanks to this analysis of Cluster data, if the killer electrons happen to be ejected towards Earth, we now know that they can strike the atmosphere within just 15 minutes. ""These new findings help us to improve the models predicting the radiation environment in which satellites and astronauts operate. With solar activity now ramping up, we expect more of these shocks to impact our magnetosphere over the months and years to come,"" says Philippe Escoubet, ESA\'s Cluster mission manager.\nThe results are published in Zong, Q.-G., X.-Z. Zhou, Y. F. Wang, X. Li, P. Song, D. N. Baker, T. A. Fritz, P. W. Daly, M. Dunlop, and A.

Some of them, confused, got up and began making breakfast.\nFarther east, thousands of New Yorkers were rushing onto their roofs and sidewalks to gaze up at the heavens. The sky was glowing, ribboned in yellow, white and crimson.\nAt the time, it was a dazzling display of nature. Yet if the same thing happened today, it would be an utter catastrophe.\nThe auroras of 1859, known as the “Carrington Event,” came after the sun unleashed a large coronal mass ejection, a burst of charged plasma aimed directly at the Earth. When the particles hit our magnetosphere, they triggered a fierce geomagnetic storm that lit up the sky and frazzled communication wires around the world. Telegraphs in Philadelphia were spitting out “fantastical and unreadable messages,” one paper reported, with some systems unusable for many hours.\nToday, electric utilities, telecommunications providers and the insurance industry are grappling with a scary possibility. A solar storm on the scale of that in 1859 would wreak havoc on power grids, pipelines and satellites. In the worst case, it could leave 20 million to 40 million people in the Northeast without power — possibly for years — as utilities struggled to replace thousands of fried transformers stretching from Washington to Boston. Chaos and riots might ensue.\nThat’s not a lurid sci-fi fantasy, but rather a sober new assessment by Lloyd’s of London, the world’s oldest insurance market. The report notes that a smaller solar-induced geomagnetic storm in 1989 left 6 million people in Quebec without power for nine hours.\n“We’re much more dependent on electricity now than we were in 1859,” explains Neil Smith, an emerging-risks researcher at Lloyd’s and co-author of the report. “The same event today could have a huge financial impact” — pegged at up to $2.6 trillion for an especially severe storm. (To put that in context, Hurricane Sandy caused about $68 billion in damage.)\nThe possibility of apocalypse has piqued scientific interest in solar storms in recent years. But researchers are now realizing that space weather can cause all sorts of lesser mischief, such as disorienting GPS satellites or severing contact between polar flights and air-traffic control.\nSo, in recent years, scores of businesses and government agencies are starting to take space weather more seriously. Electric-grid operators are devising plans to reroute currents through their systems to brace for solar storms. Airlines such as Delta have developed plans to reroute flights in the case of emergency. The U.S. military has begun to realize that space-weather blips can disrupt communication in the heat of battle.\nBut preparing for disruptions isn’t easy. Just as interest in space weather is surging, the United States is facing the loss of key monitoring satellites in the coming years because budget cuts mean that aging systems aren’t being replaced. And scientists are rushing to plug troubling gaps in their knowledge about these storms.\nThe problem is far from theoretical. Last month, at a conference on space weather in Silver Spring, Md., Daniel Baker of the University of Colorado announced that the sun had unleashed another large coronal mass ejection in July 2012 that traveled at speeds comparable to the Carrington Event of 1859. It missed the Earth by a week.\n“Had that storm occurred a week earlier, it would have been a direct hit,” Baker said. “And we’d probably be having a very different conversation about this today.”\nWhen it comes to space weather, the foremost concern is what a solar-induced geomagnetic storm might do to electric grids around the world.\nAt certain points in the sun’s cycle, as sunspots appear and flares erupt, the sun will eject part of its outer atmosphere, a cloud of fast-moving charged particles. If one of these coronal mass ejections hits the Earth’s magnetic field in just the right way, it can induce strong ground currents that travel through power lines, oil pipelines and telecom cables.\nA truly severe geomagnetic storm could create currents powerful enough to overload electric grids and damage a significant number of high-voltage transformers, which can take a long time to repair or replace. That could leave millions without power for months or years.\n“That’s a key vulnerability,” Smith says. “If you had a really big solar event, there just aren’t enough replacement transformers available. It can take up to 12 months to build new ones.”\nAs it turns out, most utilities don’t keep lots of spares around. The largest transformers, which convert the electricity in high-voltage lines to lower voltages, are custom-built, can cost millions of dollars and weigh up to 400 tons. Procuring a new one is a complex process that involves lining up the necessary copper and steel supplies, working with a long chain of manufacturers and arranging specialized transport. So, the Lloyd’s report notes, if even 20 transformers in the Northeast were knocked out, the logistical challenges would be “extremely concerning.”\nSmith notes that the Northeast, with its aging power grid and peculiar geologic features, is especially at risk. Suffice it to say, it’s not fun to think about what would happen to the region if 40 million people had to go without power indefinitely.\nTake Pittsburgh: One 2004 assessment from Carnegie Mellon University found that a large number of the city’s services were simply unprepared for an extended blackout. Half the city would lose water after three days if the city’s electrical pumps couldn’t be revived. Grocery stores, gas stations and cellphone networks would be knocked out. Police stations would go dark. Traffic lights would blink out. Most hospitals have backup systems in place, but emergency rooms would be strained if, say, the air conditioning went out during a hot summer.\n“The absence of such fundamental services could lead to major and widespread social unrest, riots and theft,” the Lloyd’s report warns.\nIn theory, power utilities could try to take precautions if they had advance notice of a major solar storm headed our way. Using existing satellites, the National Weather Service’s Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colo., can detect an incoming event that’s about 30 minutes away.\nGrid operators would have to react quickly. For example, PJM Interconnection operates a huge swath of the U.S. power grid from Illinois to the District of Columbia, serving 60 million people. After receiving a storm warming, human operators would re-dispatch electricity to reduce the flow of current from west to east. That would minimize the grid’s vulnerability to ground currents, Frank Koza, the executive director of operations support at PJM, said at the June space weather conference.\nFor a modest solar storm, Koza said, PJM’s operators could respond if voltages started to drop anywhere in the system. (Pepco, which delivers electricity to 778,000 homes and businesses in the District of Columbia and Maryland, is a member of PJM.)\nBut there’s a limit to how much these strategies can help. “The one we’re really concerned about is extreme space weather, a Carrington-level event,” Koza said. “What would happen in that scenario? I would have to tell you we don’t really know.”\nFor bigger storms, there are technologies that could harden the grid, such as capacitors that can help block the flow of ground currents induced by a geomagnetic event. In Quebec, the Canadian government has spent about $1.2 billion on these technologies since the 1989 blackout.\nOne problem, says Chris Beck of the Electric Infrastructure Security Council, is that many of these technologies are expensive and could make the current grid slightly less efficient in its day-to-day operations.\n“We’ve designed our power lines to work efficiently under perfect conditions — long transmission lines, high voltages,” Beck says. Unfortunately, those characteristics make the grid particularly vulnerable to a solar storm. So there’s a trade-off.\nRecently, the federal government decided to take a more serious look at the issue. Last fall, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued an order that will eventually require grid operators to prepare both operational and technological responses to a space weather event.\nKoza said he expects most grid operators to have response plans in the next year or two, but “engineered mitigation” could be another two to four years away.\nInsurance companies, meanwhile, are trying to figure out how to get a handle on the risk from a solar storm. Will a major one come around once every 150 years? More often than that? “We’re hoping we might one day be able to cover these risks,” says Smith of Lloyd’s, “but we’ll need to be able to quantify them more accurately.”\nPolicymakers have also started getting involved. For a long time, conservatives such as Newt Gingrich were mostly interested in the risks to electric grids posed by a nuclear weapon that exploded in the atmosphere and induced ground currents. In June, Gingrich spoke to members of the Electromagnetic Pulse Caucus in the House, a group of 16 Republicans and two Democrats, about this possibility. “This could be the kind of catastrophe that ends civilization,” Gingrich said, “and that’s not an exaggeration.”\nNow that the Cold War has ended, however, many of these Cassandras have switched over to warning about solar storms, which can have a similar effect, albeit on a smaller scale. Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., a founder of the EMP Caucus, has pushed a bill to protect against both “natural and man-made EMP events.” And in public, he tends to put more emphasis on solar storms.\n“We’re starting to see more awareness there,” Beck says, “although we’re not quite to the point where we’re actually putting solutions in place.”\nSetting aside apocalyptic blackouts, solar storms and space weather can create all sorts of hiccups in the global economy that scientists are only just beginning to understand.\nCase in point: During the Battle of Takur Ghar in Afghanistan in 2002, a U.S. helicopter team was sent in to pick up a team of Navy SEALs. The SEALs sent a message to the helicopter warning the team not to land, but for some reason, it was never received. The helicopter landed under intense fire and four Americans were killed — an event dramatized in Sean Naylor’s bestselling account of Operation Anaconda, “Not a Good Day to Die.”\nSome scientists now suspect that space weather could have been to blame for the incident.\nAt the space weather conference in June, Michael Kelly of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory presented early evidence that a form of space weather known as “scintillation” can cause disturbances in the ionosphere and disrupt local radio communications. Researchers are working to model this phenomenon more accurately.\nAirlines, too, have to take outbursts from the sun into account. Delta runs a number of commercial flights over the poles, such as routes between Detroit and Beijing and between Atlanta and Tokyo. But if they get a last-minute warning from the Space Weather Prediction Center of a geomagnetic storm, the planes often have to divert their routes away from the poles or risk losing radio contact with the ground. These diversions can cost thousands of dollars, Delta officials noted, so better predictions would help a great deal.\nAnd those concerns only scratch the surface.\nJoseph Kunches, a scientist at the Space Weather Prediction Center, says we’re still learning about activities that could be disrupted by solar weather. Satellite communications can go astray. Pipelines can corrode from ground currents. Even human space travel faces a threat.\n“Radiation is a big issue for space travel — particularly once you get away from the Earth’s magnetic field,” he says. Astronauts working outside the Earth’s protective shield can be particularly vulnerable to bursts of solar radiation, which can have harmful health effects. That means that if we ever want to wander around in space, it would be helpful to have a better grasp of space weather.\n“In 1972, there was actually a huge eruption that fortuitously fell between two of the Apollo flights, so the radiation didn’t hurt anybody,” Kunches says. “But it’s a problem.”\nAnd there are still plenty of unknowns. Kunches and other experts pointed to the potential impact of solar eruptions on GPS technology. Certain storms could degrade the signal as it makes its way from the satellite to the ground. GPS is built into so much of the modern economy — from navigation to geophysical exploration by oil and gas companies — that any interference with GPS signals could be quite costly.\n“I call it the cyber-electric cocoon we’ve built around the Earth,” says Baker, who heads the Space Physics Research Laboratory at the University of Colorado. “There are all these relationships that most people don’t even have a clue are there, and we’re still trying to understand everything that’s at risk.”\nOne big problem that businesses are having in preparing for a space weather attack is that they’re still not sure, exactly, what to prepare for. Should we expect a Carrington event? Something like the Quebec storm in 1989? And how often do these actually come along? After all, it’s hard to know how often we should expect catastrophic events.\n“Until we know that, the industry will be limited in its response,” said Koza of PJM Interconnection.\nAnd there’s plenty more that space scientists are still trying to grasp. It’s difficult to predict, for instance, whether a solar outburst will actually create a storm when it hits Earth. A great deal depends on how a coronal mass ejection interacts with other solar winds as it moves toward us. Kunches likens it to knowing that a hurricane is coming, but not being able to measure its barometric pressure.\nIt would also be helpful to have more spacecraft studying the sun and giving us advance warning of storms. But, if anything, the Earth’s alert systems are about to get worse, not better.\nRight now, the United States has four space satellites situated between the Earth and the sun, which can provide roughly 30 minutes’ warning of a major solar eruption. But these satellites are all reaching the end of their planned lives (and fuel tanks), and there’s only one replacement satellite scheduled to launch in 2014.\nAt the space conference in June, various speakers discussed ways to improve our ability to watch the sun. One engineer described fantastical plans for a satellite with a 100-square-meter “sail” that would use be steered and pushed by the sun’s photons in order to get closer and closer to the star without getting sucked in by gravity. A solar-sail satellite could, in theory, give us twice as much warning to prepare for a space storm.\nBut so far, these plans are all theoretical. “There’s a real need for a truly operational, 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week space weather observatory,” Baker says. “But right now, we don’t see that coming from policymakers or the agencies that would have to step up.”\nThat means we may have to hope for a bit of luck in the years ahead. Solar activity tends to follow an 11-year cycle, with the most intense events often occurring near the peaks of the solar maximum — which, NASA says, could well arrive in late 2013, although it’s difficult to predict for sure.\nThat doesn’t mean the big one will hit then (for one thing, sunspot activity has been rather muted of late). But it does lend some urgency to the problem.\n“We’re really on an unknown timeline here,” Beck says. “One of these could happen at any time.”\nSign up for e-mail news updates.']"	['<urn:uuid:f1d324ed-cb70-43e1-9680-2fa75581842e>', '<urn:uuid:2ab97540-2eb5-48ff-ac41-f886205d30ba>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	17	80	3367
82	pope julius ii commissioned works from which renaissance masters comparison michelangelo bramante	Pope Julius II commissioned works from both Michelangelo and Bramante. Michelangelo spent four years painting the Vatican's Sistine Chapel ceiling for Pope Julius II, creating 343 biblical figures. Meanwhile, Bramante was commissioned by Pope Julius II to rebuild St. Peter's Basilica, which was considered the grandest architectural commission of 16th century Europe.	"['By Kasey Catt\nDonato Bramante was a famous Italian architect and painter who is best known for his work on St. Peter’s Basilica . Born in 1444 to a farmer’s family, he began his artistic career under the guidance of the noted Renaissance artists of Mantegna and Piero della Francesca . In his early studies he was most interested in the rules of perspective . Although his architecture skills eventually surpassed his artistic skills, his early art training can be seen throughout his buildings .\nBarmante moved to the city of Milan in approximately 1474 to continue his architectural development . The city of Milan was filled with buildings of the gothic style which influenced Bramante during the creation of several churches in the city . His works were noticed by the Duke Ludovico Sfora and Bramante completed many works for his new patron . In addition to essentially being Sfora’s personal court architect, Bramante’s relation with Sfora culminated with the rebuilding of the church of Santa Maria presso San Satiro. Bramante also built the structures of Santa Maria delle Grazie, cloisters of Sant’Ambrogio, and Palazzo Caprini among other smaller works in Milan. As the French army invaded Milan in 1499, Barmante’s patron, Sforza, fled and Bramante followed suit moving to Rome where he spent the rest of his life .\nOnce in Rome, Bramante’s talents were soon recognized by Cardinal Della Rovere. The cardinal becoming Pope Julius II gave Bramante a very powerful and wealthy patron. Early in his relation with Pope Julius, Bramente worked on the plans for the Belvedere courtyard in the Vatican in . Another one of his notable works for the Pope included the cloister of santa Maria della Pace near Piassa Navona. One of Barmante’s most amazing works for the Pope was the Tempietto of San Pietro in Montoria on the Janiculum. This building could be considered “one of the most harmonious buildings of the Renaissance,” consisting of more aspects of sculpture than architecture this piece could be considered an architectural masterpiece . Bramante had planned on adding a courtyard around his work, but Pope Julius had bigger plans for him. In November 1503 Barmante was tasked with the re-building of St Peter’s Basilica . This task was “the grandest architectural commission of the European 16th century.”  The grand scale of the Basicilla occupied Bramante’s time until the end of his life in 1514. Although the basilica was not completed before Bramante’s death his architectural brilliance can be seen in its construction.\nChurch of Santa Maria presso San Satiro \nThe church was built on commission by Duke Sfora and was dedicated Saint Satyrus. Although the structure was initially attributed mainly to Bramante, it has recently come to light that he had more of a minor roll. Still his characteristic style focusing on perspective can be seen in aspects of the building. “The edifice has a nave and two aisles with barrel vault. The nave is surmounted by a dome at the crossing with the transept.” Bramante’s contributions can be seen in the choir area that had to be remodeled. In order to make up for the reduced choir size, Bramante used a perspective painting to make it look bigger than it actually is. This was one of the “first examples of trompe l\'oeil in history of art.” Trompe l’oeil is an art technique that utilizes a realistic painting style to create an optical illusion of three-dimensionality.\nImage of the church’s exterior \nImage of the church’s interior displaying Bramante’s use of perspective \nChurch at Santa Maria delle Grazie \nAlthough the structure was built initially by Guiniforte Solari, it is believed that Barmante was hired to remodel it and prepare it to be the burial place of the Sfora family. To do this the cloisters and apse were remodeled by Bramante\nImage of the apse designed by Bramante\nCloisters of Sant’Ambrogio \nPalazzo Caprini \nBelvedere courtyard in the Vatican \nThis work is an example of the high renaissance style consisting of a courtyard, piazzas and a garden. A series of terraces that are connected by steps serve to connect the Vadicant palace with the Villa Belvedere. Although Barmante never saw the work completed and the final product had alterations, his designs contained many unique ideas. “He regularized the slope as a set of terraces, linked by rigorously symmetrical stairs on the central longitudinal axis, to create a sequence of formal spaces that was unparalleled in Europe, both in its scale and in its architectural unity.” Bramante also integrated another innovation when he split the set of stairs running to the top terrace around the retaining wall and then returning to the center. The wings that flank the courtyard have three levels in the lower court and end on the terraces with the upper most level reaching the top most terrace. Bramante used his artistic perspective training to add another feature to the courtyard when he added a screening wall to hide the fact that the villa façade was not parallel to the vadicant wall.\nImage displaying Bramante’s design for the courtyard\nSanta Maria della Pace\nBuilt in 1500-1504, Bramante’s work on the cloister became a main feature in the church monastery complex. The cloister consisted of two levels “the first is articulated by shallow pilasters set against an arcade; the second also has pilasters set against an arcade which is vertically continuous with the lower storey, but with columns located in between each arch span.” This piece of art was recorded as Bramante’s first work in Rome.\nImage of the cloister designed by Bramante\nTempietto of San Pietro\nBuilt in the courtyard of San Pietro in Montorio, this piece of architecture is “considered a masterpiece of High Renaissance architecture.” Built as a monument to a martyr, this works is more artistic than structural. The structure “is composed of slender Tuscan columns, a Doric entablature modeled after the ancient Theater of Marcellus, and a dome.” This masterpiece has warranted such comments from architectural conissures:\n“The emphasis here is on the harmony of proportions, the simplicity of volumes (cylinder, hemisphere) and the sobriety of the Doric Order. The circular plan symbolizes divine perfection. Inspired by ancient temples, the Tempietto is both a homage to antiquity and a Christian memorial.""\n— Mitchell Beazley. The World Atlas of Architecture. p276.\n""For Bramante, the planning of the Tempietto must have represented the union of illusionistic painting and architecture he had spent his career perfecting. The building, too small on the inside to accommodate a congregation (only 15 feet in diameter), was conceived as a \'picture\' to be looked at from outside, a \'marker\', a symbol of Saint Peter\'s martyrdom.""\n— Marvin Trachtenberg and Isabelle Hyman. Architecture: from Prehistory to Post-Modernism. p302.\nImage of the tempietto\nSketch of Bramante’s tempietto\nSt. Peter’s Basilica \nThe rebuilding of St. Peter’s Basilica was comissiond by Pope Julius II and was the subject of a competition. In order to decide which designer would be used, the designers had to submit their plans and a winner would be chosen. From this grou, Bramante was chosen to to rebuild the basilica. Drawing inspiration from the Pantheon, the first stone in the project was laid in 1506. Barmante’s design did different from the pantheon in that it utilized four pillars to support the dome as opposed to a continuous wall. The dome was then topped with a latern. “Bramante had envisioned that the central dome be surrounded by four lower domes at the diagonal axes. The equal chancel, nave and transept arms were each to be of two bays ending in an apse. At each corner of the building was to stand a tower, so that the overall plan was square, with the apses projecting at the cardinal points.” However when pope Julius died, Bramante was replaced from the head desiging position. However, many of his original designs greatly influenced the future designers that eventually finished the construction of the basilica.\nImage describing Bramante’s plan for the basilica\nSketch showing Bramante’s design for the dome of the basilica', 'Notable Artists of Italy\nNotable Artists of Italy\nby: Meagan Wilson\nFamous Italian Artists\nItaly has given rise to some of the greatest artistic talents the world has ever known. From Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo Buonarroti to Sofonisba Anguissola and Umberto Mastroianni, the list of famous Italian artists and visionaries is extremely long. As there are too many noteworthy artists of Italian birth to do them all justice here, a few individuals are highlighted in this article.\nThe period of European history from approximately 1330 to 1550 is called the Renaissance. It marks the progression from the medieval period into the early modern era. The Renaissance began in Italy, and was a movement inspired by the philosophy of humanism, which placed more emphasis on individual accomplishments than did medieval ideologies. The influence of Greek and Roman philosophy and mythology can be seen in the works of period artists.\nLeonardo da Vinci (1452– 519) is possibly the most famous Italian artist of all time, unless you count fashion designer Georgio Armani. In addition to being a master painter and sculptor, da Vinci was a scientist, mathematician, architect, engineer, writer, astronomer and botanist. Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa and The Last Supper are among the most well known paintings of the period. Leonardo da Vinci was ahead of his time and created many sketches of mechanisms that were not used until well after his death, such as flying machines and parachutes.\nMichelangelo Buonarroti (1475–1564) spent four years painting the Vatican’s Sistine Chapel ceiling for Pope Julius II. At the completion of that grand project, 343 biblical figures adorned the ceiling of the chapel, in scenes that include oft-reproduced The Creation of Adam. Michelangelo also created The Last Judgment, which is among the frescoes decorating the sanctuary’s walls. Though Michelangelo was a highly successful painter, he was primarily a sculptor. The statues David and Pieta are among his most prestigious works.\nMasaccio (1401– 428), Donatello (1386–1486) and Brunelleschi (1377–1446) are credited with inspiring the art styles that characterized the Italian Renaissance. Masaccio was a painter, Donatello a sculptor, and Brunelleschi was the architect of the Duomo of Florence, the Florence cathedral cupola. Construction had begun on the church in 1299, but lacked a roof for 175 years after its construction because the architectural skill to create the dome had not yet caught up with the original designer’s vision.\nFemale artists received little encouragement or acceptance in Renaissance and Early Modern Europe. Nevertheless, there were a few determined souls who managed to gain recognition for their talents. Two such women are Sofonisba Anguissola (1531–1625) and Artemisia Gentileschi (1593–1652). Sofonisba was the eldest of seven children born to a Cremona merchant. Sent to study at the Bernardino Campi workshop by her father, Sofonisba refined her skills there and at the Bernardino Gratti studio. Sofonisba served as court painter for Philip II of Spain, and art instructor to the queen. She is known for her realistic, lifelike portraits.\nArtemisia Gentileschi was born in Rome, the daughter of a painter. Artemisia’s father raised her in the Roman art community, introducing her to the work of prominent artists such as Michelangelo. Artemisia’s life and art were marked by a traumatic and humiliating incident involving Agostino Tassi, a fellow artist. In her painting Judith Beheading Holofernes, based on the deuterocanonical account of Judith, Artemisia quite likely expressed both her considerable talent and feelings toward Tassi.\nOther leading Italian artists from the Renaissance period onward include the Mannerist painter Tontoretto (1518-1594), the Baroque painter Caravaggio (1571-1610), a prominent painter of the Macchiaioli, a sort of pre-impressionist group of Italian artists named Giovanni Fattori (1825-1908), sculptor Marino Marini (1901-1980), Pietro Annigoni (1910-1988), who specialized in portraits and frescoes, and sculptor Umberto Mastroianni (1910-1998), who participated in the Italian Resistance during WWII, and created many monuments after the war.\nThe Italian artists mentioned above are merely a few selections from Italy’s impressive roster of artistic geniuses. In addition to the prodigious number of Italian painters, sculptors and architects who have contributed to the traditions of fine art, Italy has given rise to some of the world’s most prestigious fashion houses. Italy truly is a well of creative talent and vision, gratifying and inspiring art students, collectors and appreciators the world over.\nNotable Artists of Italy\n""Italian Renaissance (1330-1550).""

83	underwater disposal radioactive waste mine pit advantages disadvantages containment isolation performance	For radioactive waste containment, underwater disposal in mine pits offers advantages including reduced contaminant generation and release, high waste volumes capacity, and less long-term maintenance. However, disadvantages include possible groundwater contamination, regulatory restrictions, and difficulties in future use of the site. Regarding containment performance, research shows that locations like the Tynwald Basin offer 3.5-4 times better natural radionuclide containment than other sites due to long, deep groundwater pathways and slow groundwater movement.	['Comparing the hydrogeological prospectivity of three UK locations for deep radioactive waste disposal\nHipkins, Emma Victoria\nThe UK has a large and growing inventory of higher activity radioactive waste awaiting safe long term disposal. The international consensus is to dispose of this radioactive and toxic waste within a deep geological repository, situated 200-1,000 metres beneath the ground surface. The deep geological disposal facility is designed to be a series of engineered and natural barriers. Groundwater forms an integral component of the natural barrier because it 1) controls the flux of reactive components towards the engineered repository, and 2) forms one of the primary transport mechanism through which released radionuclides can be transported away from the repository. The timescale of protection provided by the natural barrier exceeds those provided by the engineered barriers. Knowledge of the regional hydrogeology is a vital step towards predicting the long term performance of any potential repository site. Topically, a UK government decision in 2017 to re-open a nation-wide repository location search has now created a renewed mandate for site exploration. This research aims to determine the regional groundwater characteristics of three UK settings, selected to be hydrogeologically distinct, in order to determine which, if any, offers natural long term hydrogeological containment potential. The settings selected for analysis include Sellafield in West Cumbria, the Tynwald Basin within the East Irish Sea Basin, and Thetford within East Anglia. Site selection is based on diverse groundwater characteristics, and on previous research suggesting potential hydrogeological suitability at these locations. This research is novel in that it provides, for the first time, a direct comparison between the characteristics and qualities of different regional groundwater settings to contain and isolate radioactive waste, based on UK site specific data. Large and detailed numerical models for the three sites, covering areas of 30 km length by 2- 4 km depth have been developed using the open source finite element code ‘OpenGeoSys’. The models couple the physical processes of liquid flow and heat transport, in order to replicate regional scale groundwater flow patterns. Models are calibrated to measured rock properties, and predict groundwater behaviour 10,000 years into the future. Uncertain parameter ranges of lithological and fault permeabilities, and peak repository temperatures are tested to determine the possible range of groundwater outcomes. Geochemical retention is assessed separately and validated using the finite difference modelling software ‘GoldSim’. Worst case groundwater characteristics for containment and isolation at each site are compared to an ‘ideal’ benchmark far-field hydrogeological outflow scenario, and scored accordingly using a newly proposed method of assessment. Results show that the Tynwald Basin offers the best potential of the three sites for natural radionuclide containment, performing between 3.5 and 4 times better than Sellafield, and between 1.7 and 4 times better than Thetford. The Tynwald Basin is characterised by 1) long and deep groundwater pathways, and 2) slow local and regional groundwater movement. Furthermore, the Tynwald Basin is located at a feasible tunnelling distance from the coast, adjacent to the UK’s current nuclear stockpile at Sellafield, and thus could provide a simple solution to the current waste legacy problem. Results from the Sellafield model indicate that this location cannot be considered to exhibit beneficial characteristics due to short and predictable groundwater pathways which ascend, from the repository, towards surface aquifers. Finally, Thetford within East Anglia has never been drilled to depth so that sub-surface rock properties of basement, located beneath layered sediments, are based on evidence inferred from around the UK. Uncertainties in rock properties has produced a wide range of groundwater characteristic possibilities, with results indicting prospective performance to range from 0 to 2.4 times better than Sellafield. As such, the hydrogeological suitability to host a potential deep geological repository is promising when modelled with most-likely permeability values, but cannot be accurately determined at present. Consideration of decaying heat from the heat emitting waste packages at the three sites reveal that the natural groundwater flow patterns can be distorted up to as much as 7 km away from the theoretical repository, depending on setting. This thus changes the use of the term ‘near-field’ for safety assessments, as implying an area within the immediate vicinity of the excavated repository site. The overarching findings from this research are that: 1) some locations have greater long term radionuclide containment and isolation prospectivity than others, due to variable quality far-field geological and hydrogeological characteristics; 2) the effect of radiogenic heat emission on the natural groundwater flow pattern is dependent on the site specific geological and hydrogeological characteristics, and therefore so is the area defined as the ‘near-field’; and 3) a simple method of site comparison is possible for regional groundwater system under steadystate conditions. Recommendations are for scoping models of regional groundwater settings to be used as a comparative tool, such as undertaken as part of this research, to differentiate between potential sites at an early stage of the current UK site selection programme.', 'Henna Punkkinen, Markku Juvankoski, Tommi Kaartinen, Jutta Laine-Ylijoki, Elina Merta, Ulla-Maija Mroueh, Jarno Mäkinen, Emma Niemeläinen & Margareta Wahlström, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd, P.O. Box 1000, FI-02044 VTT, Finland.\nA placement of sulphide containing mine wastes under permanent water cover is demonstrated to be one of the most effective ways for preventing acid mine drainage (AMD) generation as water efficiently inhibits the oxidation of sulphides (Steffen Robertson and Kirsten Inc. 1989, Tremblay & Hogan 2001, INAP 2009). The maximum concentration of dissolved oxygen in water is around 30 times less than in the atmosphere, and even more importantly, the transfer of oxygen trough water is very limited as it can be almost 10,000 times slower than similar diffusive transfers in the air; the factors that considerably diminish the rate of acid generation and metal dissolution in subaqueous conditions (Tremblay & Hogan 2001). In addition, metal hydroxide precipitation, sulphide reduction by bacteria, and development of inhibiting sediment layers between the interaction of tailings and water comprise other favourable implications associated with the use of water covers (INAP 2009).\nThe disposal of wastes into natural waters, man-made impoundments, mined out flooded underground mine spaces or open pits are examples of the various ways in which water covers can be achieved (Steffen Robertson and Kirsten Inc. 1989, ITRC 2010). This chapter focuses on the subaqueous disposal of solid mine wastes into closed mine pits (backfilling). There are two different subaqueous variations that can be used; underwater disposal option and elevated water tables option (MEND 1995).\nBackfilling is not automatically a good choice for mine waste management (MEND 1995) and site-specific factors should always be carefully considered when weighing up the suitability of this disposal option, as the applicability of the method is very dependent on the mine site characteristics (MEND 1995, ITRC 2010). Although the method has been widely used internationally for a long time, backfilling has not always been a conscious environmental decision, but rather a matter of convenience. However, nowadays subaqueous in-pit disposal has become an increasingly considered option for environmentally acceptable permanent disposal of sulphide containing mining wastes. (MEND 1995)\nOther Closedure web pages related to the use of backfill method include:\nDescription of the methodology\nIn the subaqueous backfilling method waste is disposed into the closed pit covered with water, or in the section of the open pit where mining has ceased. The water cover forms naturally as a mixture of bedrock groundwater and rainwater and will remain the backfilled waste material water-covered, or a wet cover containing non-acid generating till layer and water is constructed (Figure 1). (Kauppila et al. 2013) Flooding can also be used to cover the backfilled waste material (MEND 1995). A protective layer between waste filling and bedrock can be placed to mitigate groundwater contamination (Kauppila et al. 2013). Reducing the hydraulic gradient to near zero across the pit or making diffusion the main transport mechanism are ways to constrain convective outflow and diminish contaminant release potential (MEND 1995).\nFigure 1. Waste rocks (with/without tailings blended) backfilled into the open pit under water cover. Till is used to cover shallow water areas. (adapted from Kauppila et al. 2013)\nBackfilling practices are well developed. An extensive MEND report 2.36.1 “Review of in-pit disposal practices for the prevention of acid mine drainage – Case studies” presents the following subaqueous pit disposal concepts (MEND 1995):\n- Underwater disposal: A pit lake or wetland is situated upon the backfilling. Method can be divided into four sub-categories:\n- Simple underwater disposal. Most commonly applied subaqueous disposal option, where wastes are placed at the bottom of the pit under water. Water quality and quantity need to be taken into consideration. Other underwater disposal concepts can be considered if this option is not suitable.\n- Underwater disposal with surface barrier. A barrier reduces contaminant transport from waste to water because fine-grained material acts as a diffusion control. Clean soil (sand, clay, till etc.) is often used to cover wastes. An optimal barrier thickness can be determined by using numerical models.\n- Underwater disposal with groundwater barrier. Used if there is a risk of a substantial convective flow of groundwater through the waste disposal. Three different barrier types exist, however, these options tend to be costly and only few applications exist.\n- Underwater disposal with surface and groundwater barriers. A combination of the two previous options.\nThe underwater disposal concepts are illustrated in Figure 2.\nFigure 2. Pit disposal concepts (adapted from MEND 1995).\n- Elevated water tables: The pit is backfilled near to the original ground surface. The aim is to prevent oxidation by raising the water table above the waste into a layer of clean fill. The main difference between the two disposal methods is that in the elevated water concept the water table is usually sloped causing water to infiltrate through waste material similar to groundwater, unless control barriers are placed around the waste. The options for the elevated water tables include:\n- Saturated reactive waste. Analogous to the simple underwater disposal option.\n- Saturated reactive waste with surface barrier. Analogous to the underwater disposal option with surface barrier. Surface barrier in underwater disposal concepts is typically a diffusion barrier, but in this option an infiltration barrier can also be a potential choice, as it would inhibit convective groundwater flow by preventing rainwater infiltration. The barrier can either be a low permeability layer or a pervious layer.\n- Saturated reactive waste with bottom barrier. Analogous to the underwater disposal option with groundwater barrier. Suitable for wastes having a low permeability as the option uses of pervious surround.\n- Saturated reactive waste with surface and bottom barriers. Analogous to the underwater disposal option with surface and groundwater barriers. Suitable for wastes having a low permeability as the option uses of pervious surround.\n- Elevated water table within reactive wastes using a bottom liner. An impermeable bottom liner can be used in areas where groundwater table is depressed. Bottom layer prevents infiltrated water to leave the waste and forms a basin with elevated water table. However, if waste material has a permeability that is low enough bottom barriers are not necessarily needed, as material itself may be able to form an elevated water table.\nThe elevated water table concepts are illustrated in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Elevated water table concepts (adapted from MEND 1995).\nMEND manual 2.36.1 presents 12 case studies related to in-pit disposal (MEND 1995):\n- Underwater disposal: Collins Bay B-Zone, Saskatchewan, Canada; Island Copper, British Columbia, Canada; Udden, Sweden\n- Underwater disposal with alkaline blending: Owl Creek, Ontario, Canada\n- Underwater disposal with groundwater barriers: Rabbit Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada\n- Underwater disposal with top barrier: Solbec, Québec, Canada; Stratapound CNE, New Brunswick, Canada; Deilmann, Saskatchewan, Canada\n- No waste disposed – flooded pit studies: Robinson, Nevada, U.S.A.; Gunnar, Saskatchewan, Canada; Cluff “D”, Saskatchewan, Canada; Berkeley, Montana, U.S.A.\nIn addition, the report identifies 13 underwater disposal sites and two elevated water table examples, and lists altogether over 60 sites using in-pit disposal practices (water or dry covers), mainly located in the US and Canada.\nThe subaqueous in-pit disposal is a suitable method for both acid generating and non-acid generating solid mining (ITRC 2010). More exact, Kauppila et al. (2013) present the open-pit backfilling method to be suitable for waste rocks (for both acid generating and non-acid generating) and for neutralising tailings blended or layered in with the waste rocks (Kauppila et al. 2013). The hydrogeology of the pit and the surrounding area will play an important role when assessing the applicability of the method. Bedrock having low permeability, minimal or no groundwater gradient across the mine workings, and no significant fracture zones or faults, would offer a perfect environment for a disposal of acid generating wastes. As these ideal characteristics are only seldom achievable other desirable features include minor groundwater inflows (ending in an insignificant downstream environmental impact), acid neutralising capacity of the surrounding rocks, and geochemical characteristics that reduce the spreading of the contaminants into the surrounding environment. (Tremblay & Hogan 2001) If there is a possibility that acidic seepage from pit wall mineralization along fractures, joints, faults and pit walls may occur, this may impact on the applicability of the method (Tremblay & Hogan 2001) and other disposal activities should be used (Kauppila et al. 2013).\nNot only is important to remember that not all pits are necessarily appropriate for backfilling (Lottermoser 2007), but the subaqueous disposal of wastes itself may be challenging (Tremblay & Hogan 2001). For example, when considering the deposition of old partially or completely oxidised sulphidic wastes under water it must be taken into account that soluble secondary minerals may dissolve and potentially release metals, metalloids, and salts to the water. In fact, it is recommended that these kinds of wastes should not be deposited under water at all. (Lottermoser 2007)\nIn general, wet cover methods should not be used in arid or semi-arid regions, as in the case of subaqueous disposal it is important to reach a stable anoxic state and maintain a water saturation level that will remain continuous and complete. In arid and semi-arid climates deep water bodies are not common and year-round supply of water is not granted; the two factors that would ensure the waste material to remain permanently saturated and prevent AMD (acid mine drainage) formation (Lottermoser 2007). Also a threat of seismic events, severe storms, and the stability issues related to the water cover maintaining in the long term etc. may hinder the usability of the method (MEND 1995).\nTable 1 presents advantages and disadvantages associated with the use of subaqueous in-pit disposal method.\nTable 1. Advantages and disadvantages of subaqueous in-pit disposal (Steffen Robertson and Kirsten Inc. 1989, MEND 1995, Lottermoser 2007, ITRC 2010).\n|High waste volumes can be treated\n||Possible future use of the ore body becomes more difficult\n|Offers a permanent disposal option for mining wastes\n||If the technology is implemented as a remedial action, wastes have to be stored elsewhere when mining is underway and after the mining has ceased material needs to be moved back\n|Mine waste can be placed back to its original geochemical environment\n||Lack of detailed monitoring data for backfilled pits has been a major disadvantage; although waste backfilling to the mine workings seems to be a widely used method, only few mine sites have been carefully monitored during the previous years\n|Generation and release of contaminants reduced, most contaminants can be treated. An effective control of sulphide bearing wastes\n||Sulphides in the pit walls above the final water elevation table can oxidise and cause water quality deterioration, if no prohibitive actions are made\n||May cause environmental concerns such as groundwater contamination\n||Regulatory restrictions concerning subaqueous disposal\n|Costs savings in comparison to many other methods, especially when calculating the “total” costs for waste management actions\n||The swell factor of reactive wastes may lead to the situation where the volume of waste is larger than the deposition pit, especially as it is probable that the mine pit will flood to a point less than full\n|Long term erosional / geomorphological concerns diminished: retaining walls not needed -> no risk for the embankment stability, waste placement is a part of a stabilization plan of the mine workings\n|The risk of exposure through direct contact and accidental releases is diminished\n|Quite easily implemented\n|Future land use controls for the mine site can possibly be eliminated\n|Less long-term maintenance and monitoring needed\nMany same aspects that are related to wet cover methods in general are also applied to subaqueous in-pit backfilling method. The waste treatment capacity of the method is good, as high waste volumes can be deposited (ITRC 2010). However, the swell factor of reactive waste is commonly around 30% and this may cause a situation where there is a larger volume of waste to be deposited than originally mined, especially as it is probable that the mine pit will flood to a point less than full (Steffen Robertson and Kirsten Inc. 1989).\nThe simplest way to perform the backfilling is to use pit ramps, but also end-dumping over the edge may become in question. The most harmful wastes should be placed appropriately below water table, or layer/mix with acid neutralizing materials. (MEND 1995) The risk for groundwater contamination can be reduced by filling the gaps between waste and rock walls with fine-grained rock powder or sulphide-free tailings. (Kauppila et al. 2013)\nEnvironmental concerns may arise for example if the walls of the workings fracture, as the oxidised groundwater may be able to penetrate to the pit and accelerate oxidation. Although some concerns related to subaqueous disposal and backfilling exist, there are also examples of the cases where in-pit disposal has led to environmental improvements, as the acid generation and metal leaching from the waste rock piles located on the ground can be reduced and better observed trough underwater deposition (MEND 1995).\nCosts for the method are site specific and depend on the selected disposal concept (Tremblay & Hogan 2001). However, general cost estimates for the in-pit disposal options (both dry and wet cover methods) are given by Tremblay & Hogan (2001). They assess the unit costs for waste rock disposal to be between $1 and $2 / waste tonne, and for tailings $1 and $3 /waste tonne, without including site specific factors. (Tremblay & Hogan 2001)\nWater cover methods require adjusting of the water level, and a construction of overflow channels or water discharge pipes. In the case of water quality deterioration, an active or passive treatment must be performed. (Kauppila et al. 2013) A sufficiently thick water layer should be used in underwater disposal to assure that the waste will remain water covered. The size of the area to be covered together with the wind conditions causing vertical blending of water will have an influence of the required water layer thickness. However, the water blending can be prevented using underwater ridges covered with till. If the water depth is not deep enough, a surface barrier can be used to cover the waste. (Kauppila et al. 2013) Also the effects of cold climate should be taken into consideration in Nordic countries. Continuous revision of the original deposition plan, together with field studies and thermal modelling are important in regions where freezing occurs at regular intervals. (MEND 1995)\nAs mentioned earlier, the applicability of the method is strongly dependent on site-specific conditions, and it is important to remember that not all pits are necessarily appropriate for backfilling (Lottermoser 2007). Also the nature and extent of technical studies, controlling, and maintenance needed will differ site specifically (MEND 1995). Although subaqueous deposition of wastes into the old mine workings has been widely used earlier, not until recently the proper designing and the environmental acceptability issues of the method have been more closely perceived. A careful examination of several factors, taking also account of both the short and long term effects, is essential when assessing the suitablility of the method for the certain mine site and choosing the appropriate concept for use. (Table 2) All presented concepts for in-pit disposal are generally well developed, and although several requirements and site characterisation issues have to be considered and determined during the planning and designing phase these aspects can be nowadays reasonable well assessed.

84	What role does temperature play in nerve conduction velocity, and how does this affect multiple sclerosis symptoms?	Temperature affects nerve conduction by altering channel gating - warming accelerates sodium channel activation which increases conduction velocity. In multiple sclerosis patients, this temperature sensitivity is particularly important as increases in body temperature can cause exacerbations of previous symptoms, which should be distinguished from actual disease relapses that last weeks to months.	['What is the conduction velocity of the median nerve?\nFor median motor nerve, the values of distal latency and conduction velocity in males were 2.9 ± 0.16 ms and 60.25 ± 2.99 m/s, respectively, whereas, in females, they were 2.6 ± 0.43 ms and 59.83 ± 2.82 m/s.\nWhat does nerve conduction velocity depend on?\nConduction velocity is dependent on internode distance, with a broad maximum centered around the value observed in normal peripheral fibers. Conduction velocity is also dependent on temperature and the properties of the axonal milieu.\nWhat is the normal range of nerve conduction?\nNCV tests can measure the speed and strength of nerve signals. Nerve conduction velocity between 50 to 60 meters per second is considered normal.\nWhat factors might influence nerve conduction velocity?\nPhysiological factors such as age, temperature, height, and gender are known to affect the nerve conduction velocity (NCV).\nWhy is conduction velocity important?\nIn neuroscience, nerve conduction velocity (CV) is an important aspect of nerve conduction studies. It is the speed at which an electrochemical impulse propagates down a neural pathway. Conduction velocities are affected by a wide array of factors, which include; age, sex, and various medical conditions.\nWhy will your calculated nerve conduction velocity therefore be an underestimate of the true conduction velocity?\nHowever, because the calculated CV is derived from a single stimulation point, it underestimates the true conduction value because it does not account for nerve activation time, tissue transit time, or physiologic slowing (discussed later here).\nWhat determines conduction velocity?\nThe conduction velocity of the action potential is determined by measuring the distance traveled (length of the nerve in m) and dividing by the time (sec) taken to complete the reflex arc, also called the latency. Conduction velocity = distance (m)/time (sec). Measurement of distance is relatively straightforward.\nWhat are the two main factors that determine conduction velocity in a neuron explain how each impacts conduction velocity?\nConduction velocity is influenced by myelin sheath thickness and internode distance (i.e. the distance along the axon between the nodes of Ranvier) (Hursh, 1939), and both parameters are linearly related to axon diameter.\nWhat are the two main factors that determine conduction velocity in a neuron?\nThe speed of neuron transmission generally depends upon two factors: axon size and degree of myelination. Larger diameter axons transmit signal faster due to lower resistance to the flow of charge inside the axon.\nWhy does age affect nerve conduction velocity?\nPatients with older age had longer latencies, smaller amplitudes, and slower conduction velocities compared with the younger age group. The change with age was greater in sensory nerve conduction and late responses in all the peripheral nerves.\nWhat is the relationship between nerve size and conduction velocity?\nThe conduction velocity is proportional to fiber diameter, and there is an optimum ratio of myelin thickness to fiber diameter for maximal conduction velocity. Internodal length is roughly proportional to fiber diameter in normal nerve populations (Hiscoe 1947; Vizoso and Young 1948; Vizoso 1950).\nWhat is the relationship between nerve size and conduction velocity explain?\nLarger diameter axons have a higher conduction velocity, which means they are able to send signals faster. This is because there is less resistance facing the ion flow.\nHow is nerve conduction velocity measured?\nThe nerve conduction velocity (speed) is then calculated by measuring the distance between electrodes and the time it takes for electrical impulses to travel between electrodes. A related procedure that may be performed is electromyography (EMG).\nWhy is the speed of conduction through a reflex arc slower than the speed of conduction of an action potential along an axon?\nWhy is the speed of conduction through a reflex arc slower than the speed of conduction of an action potential along an axon? a. Transmission between neurons at synapses is slower than along axons.\nWhich type of nerve has the highest conduction velocity?\nUp until now, we have only activated fibres in the A-alpha group, the largest group of fibres in the nerve, containing fibres with the largest diameters and highest conduction velocity.\nWhat increases conduction velocity?\nMyelination improves the conduction velocity—the speed with which action potentials travel—in axons. Axon diameter also affects conduction velocity; fatter axons carry action potentials faster.\nWhy does conduction velocity increase with temperature?\nThe primary effects of temperature on nerve function occur by altering the kinetics of channel gating. The acceleration of sodium channel activation with warming increases conduction velocity, while the acceleration of sodium channel inactivation shortens the relative refractory period.\nHow does myelin increase conduction velocity?\nSummary. Myelin can greatly increase the speed of electrical impulses in neurons because it insulates the axon and assembles voltage-gated sodium channel clusters at discrete nodes along its length. Myelin damage causes several neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.\nHow does myelin help increase conduction velocity quizlet?\nMyelination increases conduction velocity by: 1) electrically insulating the axon, which increases Rm and reduces membrane capacitance. This increases the length constant and reduces the time constant.\nWhy is the speed of conduction slower in Unmyelinated neurons?\nMyelinated neurons conduct impulses faster than unmyelinated neurons because nerve impulses jump over the myelin sheath rather than travel through it, making the distance to the axon terminal shorter. This occurs due to the large proportion of fatty substances that make up the myelin sheath.\nHow does the loss of myelin sheath alter nerve conduction velocity?\nMyelin reduces membrane leakiness by preventing open channels and as a result, increasing how far a single electrical impulse within the axon will travel. Importantly this also increases how quickly an action potential will travel down an axon – myelin greatly increases the conduction velocity of a neuron (Figure 2.3.\nHow does myelin decrease capacitance?\nMyelin in fact decreases capacitance and increases electrical resistance across the cell membrane (the axolemma) thereby helping to prevent the electric current from leaving the axon.\nHow does capacitance affect the velocity of the action potential?\nCapacitance affects the velocity (rate) of the action potential. Decrease the capacitance, and increase the velocity of the action potential.', '- What is Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\n- Statistics on Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\n- Risk Factors for Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\n- Progression of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\n- Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\n- Clinical Examination of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\n- How is Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Diagnosed?\n- Prognosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\n- How is Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Treated?\n- Multiple Sclerosis (MS) References\nWhat is Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). Nerves in the body are covered with a fatty sheath called myelin. Myelin considerably increases the speed that nerve signals (impulses) travel down the axons. A thin myelinated axon transmits impulses at anything from 5 to 30 meters per second, whereas an unmyelinated one transmits them at 0.5 to 2 meters per second. It does this by both insulating and containing the nerves.\nIn MS, there are multiple areas of damage to the myelin sheath (demyelination) within the brain and spinal cord. This causes conduction problems within the central nervous system. The peripheral nervous system is not usually involved but may be subtly. MS can manifest in different ways, including:\n- Relapsing remitting;\n- Primary progressive;\n- Secondary progressive (when relapsing and remitting disease becomes progressive); and\n- Progressive relapsing (a combination of relapsing remitting and progressive from the outset).\nStatistics on Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nMS is one of the most common causes of chronic neurological disability in adults, and affects approximately one million people worldwide. The disease usually starts in early adult life (20–45 years) and causes progressive disability over several decades. MS is more common in women, who outnumber males by a ratio of 2:1.\nThe prevalence of MS is directly proportional to distance from the equator. At 50–65 degrees latitude (north or south), the prevalence is 60–100 per 100,000 people. At the equator, MS is a rarity. The incidence, however, is very variable.\nApproximately one in 3,000 Australians are affected by the disorder.\nRisk Factors for Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nThe exact cause of MS is not entirely understood, but it is thought to be due to a number of genetic, environmental and immune factors. It is hypothesised that individuals with a genetic predisposition who are infected with certain viruses induce an immune response that attacks their own nerve cells.\nRisk factors for MS therefore include:\n- Latitude: Latitude is more strongly related to MS than any other risk factor. Risk of MS increases when an individual lives further away from the equator. If you migrate to a high-risk area before the age of 15, you will have the same high risk as those who were born in the area. Therefore, your risk of MS reflects that of the area in which you spent your first 15 years.\n- Sex: MS affects females more than males, but the reason for this difference is unknown.\n- Family history: If you have a first degree relative with MS, you are 15 times more likely than the general population to suffer from MS (this is still a very low risk). Twins from the same egg (monozygotic) are more likely to have MS than those from separate eggs (dizygotic) if one twin is affected.\n- Race: MS presents more often in populations of northern European ancestry.\n- Vitamin D Status: Low levels of vitamin D exposure result in an increased risk of MS.\n- Smoking: smokers have an increased risk of developing MS\n- Epstein-Barr Virus: Exposure to EBV increases the risk of MS\n- Diet: It is thought that diets high in animal fats may increase the risk of MS, due to observations that MS is uncommon in coastal communities where large amounts of fish are consumed.\nProgression of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nMost patients have a relapsing/remitting disease, where they have discrete attacks of symptoms (such as loss of vision and limb sensations/weakness) that last weeks to months and then completely resolve. These attacks may not have a clear precipitant, and on average tend to occur once every two years. These attacks or relapses should be distinguished from minor exacerbations of previous symptoms which can occur with increases in body temperature. Later in the course of the disease, patients may not fully recover from attacks and experience progressive disability. This is the secondary progressive form of disease, which occurs in 50% of patients after 15 years. The majority of MS cases will eventually evolve into the secondary progressive form.\nSome patients may have only one or two attacks and may fully recover from these attacks. In other patients, the disease will progress and produce severe disability, or even death.\nOther patients have primary progressive disease, which shows a rapid decline in function without any acute attacks. This occurs in approximately 20% of patients and affects males and females equally. However, males with this disorder have the worst prognosis, as spinal cord involvement leads to early disability.\nThe final type of MS is relapsing progressive, affecting 5% of patients. This is an overlap of the former types, characterised by a progressive course from the onset but with additional superimposed acute attacks.\nSymptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nAs MS can affect virtually anywhere in the CNS, a wide variety of neurological manifestations are possible. However, some of the major patterns of symptoms aside from weakness and loss of sensation/pain include:\n- Fatigue (the most common symptom);\n- Blurred vision and mild pain of the eye due to damage to the optic nerve;\n- Diplopia (double vision), vertigo, facial numbness and weakness or dysphagia due to brainstem demyelination;\n- Ataxia (imbalance) and tremor;\n- Spasticity (sometimes with spasms) with difficulty walking, urinary dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction;\n- Mood alteration.\nYour doctor will take a detailed history of your symptoms and try to determine whether you fit a relapsing/remitting or progressive form of the disorder. The diagnosis of MS relies on the demonstration of symptoms that are separated in time and anatomical location, and are unexplained by another condition.\nClinical Examination of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nYour doctor will perform a complete neurological examination, including testing your gait (walking), sensation and vision. They will also use a device called an ophthalmoscope to look at the retina at the back of the eye. This can identify abnormalities of the optic disc caused by optic neuritis. Double vision, nystagmus (oscillating movements of the eyes) and loss of vision are other signs often found on examination.\nHow is Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Diagnosed?\nMS can usually be diagnosed by careful history and examination as there are very few neurological conditions of young people that follow a similar relapsing and remitting course. However, some patients may not have the classical signs, or may be affected at a very young or older age. In these patients, further investigation may be needed to exclude other medical conditions, such as vasculitis, sarcoidosis, encephalitis, tuberculosis, brain tumours, Alzheimer’s disease and vitamin B12 deficiency.\nThe most common investigations for MS include:\n- MRI: This is the first-line investigation. MRI may show plaques of demyelination in the spinal cord and brain.\n- Electrophysiological testing (evoked potentials): This measures the nerve potentials in visual, auditory and somatosensory pathways, and can detect whether nerves have been damaged and conduction delayed.\n- Lumbar puncture: Analysis of spinal fluid by lumbar puncture may show raised numbers of cells during acute attacks. Between attacks, there may be local production of antibodies (known as oligoclonal bands).\n- Electroencephalogram: EEG is mainly used to exclude other conditions such as encephalitis, but usually the clinical differentiation of this condition is not difficult.\nPrognosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nThere is no way to predict the course of MS in a patient. In some, the disease will not affect them much and they will be able to continue their normal lives, others may have considerable disability. Overall, patients with MS are said to have a life expectancy 7 years less than the general population. Most deaths occur from complications of disability (such as recurrent infections in bedridden patients) rather than from acute attacks.\nThe following factors may be associated with a worse prognosis:\n- Bowel and/or bladder symptoms at onset\n- Short interval between first and second attacks\n- Incomplete remission after first relapses\n- Early disability\n- High relapse rate in early years\n- High lesion load detected by MRI during early years of illness\n- Male sex, though this has been contradicted by more recent research\n- Older age at onset, though this has been contradicted by more recent research\nHow is Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Treated?\nThere are a number of different treatments available for MS to reduce the severity and frequency of exacerbations, and possibly to alter the progression of disability later on. However, to date, no drug has been found that can halt or reverse the progression of disease. This would require a drug that can perform the difficult task of remyelination of damaged nerves.\nYour doctor will discuss the best treatment for you based on the severity and type of your condition. This may include some of the following treatments:\n- Corticosteroids: Methylprednisolone is the usual treatment given in acute attacks to reduce their severity.\n- Beta-interferon: (Betaferon, Avonex, Rebif): This drug is given by a subcutaneous injection and can reduce the rate of relapses by a third. This is often the first-line treatment for relapsing/remitting disease.\n- Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone): This drug is another immunomodifier that also reduces the frequency and severity of attacks.\n- Oral immunosuppressants: Immunosuppressants have been recently developed and show promise in reducing the number of attacks.\n- Other immunosuppressant medications such as azothioprine and cyclophosphamide are used in some patients and can reduce relapses. However they do not decrease the number of lesions seen on MRI as well as the former drugs.\n- Muscle relaxants (baclofen, dantrolene, benzodiazepines): Can reduce the discomfort and pain of spasticity.\n- Oxybutinin, a bladder muscle antispasmodic, and intermittent urinary catheterisation (inserting a thin tube via the urethra to empty the bladder): May help urinary incontinence.\n- Physiotherapy and occupational therapy: Have an extremely important role.\nArticle kindly reviewed by:\nAssociate Professor Karl Ng MB BS (Hons I) FRCP FRACP PhD CCT Clinical Neurophysiology (UK) Consultant Neurologist – Sydney North Neurology and Neurophysiology (download referral form and map); Conjoint Associate Professor – Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney; and Editorial Advisory Board Member of the Virtual Neuro Centre.\n|For more information on multiple sclerosis and symptoms associated with this disease, see Multiple Sclerosis (MS).|\n|For more information on neurological disorders that affect movement, and their treatments, see Neurological Rehabilitation and Movement Disorders.|\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) References\n- Trapp BD, Nave KA.

85	How should image compression be handled, and what authentication measures protect it?	Image compression should be managed both before upload (by sizing images appropriately, reducing pixel density to 72dpi, and removing metadata) and through WordPress plugins like WP Smush, TinyPNG, or ShortPixel. To secure these assets, implementing two-factor authentication and limiting login attempts are essential protective measures, along with using strong passwords for all user accounts.	['Optimizing Images in WordPress\nThese days, image-heavy design is the norm. The web is a visual experience and including high-quality photos in your content – often multiple per page – is key to attracting and converting traffic.

When we’re thinking about reducing image size at Road Warrior Creative, my marketing agency, we generally approach it in two different ways:\n- optimizations that happen to the image offline – before it even gets uploaded to the website, and\n- optimizations the can be done on the website.\nLet’s dive a little deeper into those two things.\nHow To Optimize An Image Before You Upload It\nThere are several ways to optimize and image before you even upload it to your website, and the first is by determining if you really should be using an image in the first place!\nEliminate Improper Use of Images\nIncluding photos or graphics throughout your content is great, but if your image has text on it, think twice before you upload!\nWe frequently see people make posters or graphics for events and then post them directly into blog posts or static pages on their websites, often with little or no accompanying text. Not only is it bad for accessibility to have text and vital information on an image (because it’s invisible to screen readers), but it’s also bad for mobile users who will have to zoom in to read the text and, you guessed it, these types of images are also typically very large files.\nThis image, for example, is great for marketing on social media or in an email, but not good to embed directly on a web page:\nIf you have images like this, they should be built as web pages, where some parts of the\nUse the Right Image Format\nThere are two types of image formats:\n- vector graphics that use lines and shapes to represent an image and that can be scaled up or down without losing quality, and\n- raster images that use pixels, and will lose quality if zoomed in or size up from the original image size.\nMost images that typical users will upload are raster images. These are file types like JPEGs, PNGs, and GIFs. We’ll come back to these in a moment.\nAn example of a vector file\nTypically, SVG images are used more by WordPress developers when building themes or plugins, but you can try adding them too! WordPress’ media library does not support SVG uploads by default,\nNote that came up during our Meetup: Because they are made of code, it is important to be aware that SVG files can contain malicious code that can harm\nJPEG and PNG Images\nJPEG or JPG images are what you’ll most commonly see on the web. This is the type of file that your camera saves when you take a picture, and have the ability to be optimized for the web, typically with a smaller file size\nPNG files were made for web viewing – they don’t support print-specific color modes, and they have support for transparency, which\nSave Your Image for the Web\nOne of the biggest mistakes we see people making is not saving their images for the web prior to upload. Don’t take a full-size image from your camera or Shutterstock, and upload it directly to your WordPress site!\nAn image is considered “saved for the web” if you have done the following:\nSize the Image for Use\nAt most, your image should only be 2x as large as the size at which you intend to display it. The 2x consideration takes into account retina devices that may make your image look pixelated when displayed at twice the pixel density, but in my experience, this typically only matters for graphics like logos and icons, not photographs.\nWhat does this mean in real life? If you use images that are 900px wide on your blog, then you should typically upload either a 900px wide image or, at most, and 1800px image. Don’t upload photographs that are 5000+ pixels wide! This is way too big and unnecessary.\nReduce Pixel Density to 72dpi\nPixel density refers to the number of pixels that are in an inch. In print we use 300dpi. Some cameras take images that have thousands of pixels per inch. On the web, all you need is 72 pixels per inch. Your images will still look great and your image size will be cut in half.\nRemove Image Meta Data\nImage files often have lots of unnecessary meta data saved in the file – information about the camera that took the image, location, etc. Removing this unnecessary data will significantly reduce your image size.\nHow to Save Images for the Web\nYou can save images for the web using a photo editing software like Photoshop or Lightroom, or Gimp a free, open source photo editor. If you have a Mac, you can save images for the web in Preview, and on a PC, you can even do many of these optimizations in MS Paint.\nOptimizing Images in WordPress\nAfter you have prepared your images for upload and you get them on your website, that’s not the only thing that needs to be done to ensure that they’re loading quickly.\nFirst, a reminder to always use the right image size! I cannot emphasize that enough. This is especially important for WordPress theme and plugin developers to keep in mind when developing their products.\nAdd An Image Compression Plugin\nAn image compression plugin will further optimize your images by stripping unnecessary data and compressing the image as much as possible to reduce the size of the file. There are websites, like TinyPNG.com, where you can upload and compress infinite images for free,\nHere is some information on popular image compression plugins for WordPress that you might like to check out. There are more than are included on this list below, however these are some of the top on our list.\nWP Smush (Free)\nWP Smush is a very popular free image compression plugin. You can find WP Smush on WordPress.org here. This is a good introductory plugin, however it does have some downsides:\n- You can only bulk smush 50 images at a time.\n- It will not optimize images over 1MB in size\n- It doesn’t perform well in comparisons (more on this below)\nWP Smush Pro\nThis is the professional version of WP Smush. It does a great job of optimizing images down to a much smaller size without losing quality, and with the pro\nThis $49/month grants you access to all the plugins made by WPMU Dev, this author of WP Smush, however, if WP Smush Pro is all you need, that may seem like a hefty price tag, depending upon your budget and the number of images that you need to compress each month.\nTinyPNG WordPress Plugin\nThe same website referenced above has a TinyPNG WordPress plugin that allows you to optimize images as you upload them to your media library. TinyPNG will optimize all image types (not just PNGs), so don’t be fooled by its name. It does a great job compressing images.\nTinyPNG is a freemium plugin, which means you can use it for free up to a point. You can compress up to 500 images each month for free. After that, you’ll typically pay $0.009/image compression.\nShortPixel is another freemium WordPress plugin for compressing image. On the free plan, you can compress up to 100 images per month. After that, there are several pricing tiers based on volume; 100-5000 image compressions per month is $4.99, for example.\nIn our tests, ShortPixel did the best job of compressing images to\nreSmush.it is a free, open-source image compression plugin with no paid version.\nWhich Compression Plugin Should I Choose?\nWith all the options out there, you may be wondering which plugin to choose. I don’t think there is any plugin that is right for every website, because every website and website owner has different needs. Here are some things to consider when choosing a compression plugin:\n- How much to you need to reduce image file size by?\n- How much do you care about image quality in the final image? Final image quality probably matters a lot more to a photographer than a lawyer, for example.\n- How many images will you upload to your site every month?\n- How many images sizes does your site generate every time you upload an image? Core WordPress likely generates at least 3 sizes; your theme and some plugins will also generate some – all of these count against any image quotas.\n- How large will your starting files be? (Hopefully not more than 5MB… 😉\n- What is your budget?\nDo A Compression Test\nIf you are trying to decide between a couple of different ones, try running a compression test! Install both plugins either on the same site, one at a time, or on different sites. Configure them similarly, then upload the same image to see how the images look and by how much each plugin is able to reduce the file size.\nWe recently ran a similar test. We offer WordPress website hosting to our clients and wanted to start including image compression software in every website we host. For this test, we tried all the plugins above, except for TinyPNG. Here is the original images that we tested\nObviously, this image is massive and is completely wrong for the web. It hasn’t been pre-optimized at all, and\nHere are the results, in order from least reduction in file size to most (largest file to smallest file). All image sizes listed, reference the file size for the “full-size” image\nIn the above compression test, ShortPixel was the best as reducing file size, but had noticeable image quality loss – the edges of some of the peppers and mango pieces were blurrier than we would prefer. WP Smush Free barely reduced the file size, and WP Smush Pro and reSmush.it had the most noticeable difference in color vibrancy – we guess that was as a result of those plugins changing the color mode from CMYK to RGB.\nAfter looking at final results, we ran one more test, first saving the image for web in a normal RGB color mode, and WP Smush Pro was able to reduce the file size to 210KB with no\nThis one did lose some “vibrancy” but that happened at the time when we converted it RGB color mode in Photoshop, not during compression.\nWhat We Chose\nIf you’re wondering what we chose, we ended up deciding to go with WP Smush Pro. This does not mean it’s the right plugin for you, but it was for us, largely because we were adding it to 50+ sites and did not want to have to worry about potential costs when paying on a per-image basis or having to limit image size or number.\nIf you have fewer sites and have total control over what’s being uploaded, one of the other options might work perfectly for you.\nWhat is the ideal size?\nDuring our meetup, someone asked what the ideal size is. Unfortunately, there is no clear answer to that. As mentioned above, optimization is a little bit science and a little\nThe ideal size for an image is as small as you can possibly get it without making it noticeably bad to look at.\nIf you really want an ideal size, then you need to do a little math. Your total page size for initial load should be under 3MB. Do a speed test of your page or post, with no images added in see how large the page is. Subtract that from 3MB and you’ll know how much “space” you have left for images.\nOther Ways to Speed Up Your Site\nOptimizing images is just one way to speed up your website. If you’re interested in approving your site speed, please check out the case study linked above (in the SVG section). You may also want to do some research into:\n- how your hosting impacts website speed,\n- adding something like “lazy load” to incrementally add things to the page as users scroll, and/or\n- improving your website’s code.\nHave comments or questions about image optimization?

86	What happened to French settlers in Peoria?	The French settlers in Peoria were chased out by the British during the War of 1812. Many of them floated down the river to Cahokia, and some went to St. Louis.	"[""PEORIA — Though Dennis Stroughmatt estimates that there are only about 15 people alive who still speak the French dialect spoken by Illinois and Missouri’s earliest non-native settlers, sometimes he gets surprised.\n“About three years ago we were playing at a festival in Old Mines, Mo., and this old man walks up to me and starts singing in French,” said Stoughmatt during a telephone interview from his home in Albion, Ill., on Monday. “He’s about 80, and I’m understanding every word. I asked him where he learned that, and he said, ‘I learned it from my mom.’”\nThe man hadn’t spoke the language for about 20 years, ever since his mother died. He hadn’t grown up in the Old Mines area, where a cluster of people still speak the language — he’d grown up in St. Charles, Mo.\n“His parents had moved out of the community before he was born. His dad worked in a factory and his mom stayed home and spoke French with the kids. He was an educated man — I think he worked in insurance. You wouldn’t see it coming at all — and all of a sudden here rolls out this perfect Missouri-Illinois French.”\nAs Stroughmatt visited with the man, another person joined the conversation, and pretty soon a crowd formed around the French-speaking trio. Spectators started taking pictures.\n“I thought, ‘Oh, man, this is a moment.’ It’s kind of cool when you get three people speaking that language,” said Stroughmatt. “The man said, ‘This is my language, and I don’t have anybody to talk it with anymore.'”\nStroughmatt will be speaking Missouri-Illinois French and singing traditional songs during a visit to the Peoria Public Library North Branch from 2 to 3:30 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 15.\nMissouri-Illinois French is a term used for a specific dialect that has persevered in the region since French immigrants settled here in the late 1600s. It differs from Cajun French, which came from south-central France, said Stroughmatt. Missouri-Illinois French, and music, has a more celtic bent because it came from the area of Normandy and Brittany.\n“Cajun music also ends up with a lot of influences from Louisiana that we don’t get here — they get the German and Czech influences. They adapted the accordion and incorporated polkas. This is stuff that doesn’t come into the French communities here. Our music has a purity going all the way back to France.”\nIt’s likely that Missouri-Illinois French was once spoken in Peoria, which was populated by French settlers until they were chased out by the British during the War of 1812.\n“A lot of those people floated down the river to Cahokia, and some went to St. Louis,” said Stroughmatt. “Some of the words and songs I do I learned in Cahokia, so it’s very possible that some of the descendants once lived in Peoria.”\nStroughmatt learned about Illinois’ French population while growing up in southern Illinois.\n“Growing up near Vincennes is what got me into it,” said Stroughmatt. “We used to go there a lot.”\nWhen he was a teenager, his grandfather gave him his great-grandfather's fiddle, and Stroughmatt became fascinated with the traditional French music played by some musicians in the area. When he was in college a professor told Stroughmatt about the French-speaking community in southern Missouri. At that time there was a pocket of several hundred people who still spoke the language.\n“I went down there and ended up hunting people down. I spent weeks at a time, and summers, learning to play fiddle with some of the old French Creole fiddlers,” said Stroughmatt, who in the process became fluent in the old language. He went on to earn degrees in history and historic preservation, and learned how to read and write in French during a six-month intensive in Quebec.\n“And they didn’t even try to change the way I spoke. They said, ‘You sound like some of the really old people here,’” said Stroughmatt. “There are some pockets in Quebec where people speak like we do here. In a sense, they are using third- and fourth-century French.”\nOver the years linguists have made their way to southern Missouri to study the language and count how many speakers remained. Stroughmatt began learning the language at a pivotal time, and today he finds himself charged with the task of helping keep the dialect and music alive. In 2012 he was asked to perform with his band, L’Esprit Creole, at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., during the Homegrown Concert Series, which celebrates the best traditional music throughout the country.\n“There are some people who don’t think Missouri-Illinois French fiddling is unique at all — I had one fiddle player who came up and blatantly said that, and I’m like, ‘I appreciate your point, but the Library of Congress sees it differently,’” he said, “Our bowing style, our fingering style, our rhythm is all different.”\nThough Stroughmatt is a bit reluctant in his role as an ambassador of a culture he wasn’t born into, he’s glad he can show the world its value.\n“A lot of people growing up in the community were told their music and their language were worthless, but because I existed they found the retribution they deserve. It’s unique, and people do care about it.”\nLeslie Renken can be reached at 686-3250 or firstname.lastname@example.org.

87	What's common between Euclid's basic geometry and ancient measurements?	Both rely on fundamental geometric principles involving points and lines - Euclid's geometry starts with dimensionless points and straight lines, while ancient measurements like Eratosthenes' Earth calculation and construction layout depend on straight lines and the angles they form.	"[""Geometry in construction = practical geometry.\nDoes that seem strange, a philosophical stretch? As recently as the 1930's it was widely understood, commonplace. Since the 1950's, geometry has been taught as precise, logical, beautiful, magical, amazing. But practical? Barely. Today the idea is usually met with skepticism.\nHowever, you who read my blog know this is what I study: what those builders know about geometry and how did they use it?\nEuclid's geometry starts with a Point which has no dimensions. Two points make a Line - 1 dimension. 3 make a Plane - 2 dimensions.\n4 points make an object - 3 dimensions.\nA Line laid out between 2 points will always be straight.\nA Line drawn by hand might curve; a Line marked by snapping a length of twine cannot curve. This is the beginning: it will be true. If the geometry is not accurate it will not be practical.\nThe Line A-B can become a radius. The radius can draw a circle.\nWhether the circle is drawn with a compass set to the length of the radius. or by hand with a length of twine, it will close if the the work is accurate. If the circle does not close upon itself it is not true. At every step of the layout if the geometry doesn't hold, the designer will know to stop and correct the drawing.\nThe radius of the circle always divides the circumference of the circle into 6 parts. If the points on the circle, marked by swinging the arc of the radius, are not spaced accurately they will not end exactly where they began. They will not be true. The work cannot proceed. These 6 points on this daisy wheel are not quite accurate. Note that the daisy petals' shapes are not identical; the points are not equidistant. If I measured the diameters, petal to petal, they would not match. I was not careful enough.\nThe 6 points, joined with lines, can be used in construction.\nThe rectangles that come from the 6 points can be proved by their diagonals. If they match, the rectangle will have 90* corners and be true. If the diagonals do not match the shape is not a rectangle.\nA building needs to be stable, whatever materials it is made from, whatever form it takes. For simple vernacular housing the circle was the practical geometry needed to erect a stable, sturdy dwelling.\nThe layout tools available to the builder of the Lesser Dabney House* in rural Virginia, c. 1740, were twine, some pegs, a straight edge, some chalk or soot so the twine could mark a line, perhaps a scribe, a compass.\nHe could have laid out this house with the first 4. A peg could have served as a scribe to mark a point. Twine with a loose knot around a peg turns as a compass does.\narcs to find the center of his circle C. Then he drew his circle. And found it true. The circle's radius steps off 6 times around its circumference. The arc create the 'daisy wheel'.\nA-B in the diagram above became 1-2, the width of the house. The arcs 1-3 and 2-6 of that width crossed at the center of the circle with its 6 points: 1,2,3,4,5,6.\nThe Lines 1-5 and 2-4 laid out the side walls; 6-3 locate the back wall. Diagonals across the rectangular floor plan proved the layout to be true.\nThe main block is about 20'x17'. The 2 doors welcomed cooling through breezes in the summer. The wall room on the right may been a later addition to create a parlor, more private and warmer in winter.\nLater the builder added the shed. He made his twine the length of the house, folds it in half and then in half again. He then knew what was 1/4 the length of the house (x). He laid out that length (x) 3 times to get the depth of his shed. He stretched his twine diagonally from one corner to the other. If the twine measured5 (x) his shed walls were a 3/4/5 rectangle; the corners 90*, and true to the main house. The shed roof framed cleanly against the house and was weather tight.\nThe circle and the 3/4/5 triangle - Practical Geometry - were the only measuring systems necessary to construct this house.\n*The Lesser Dabney House, Fig. 45, Type 3, p, 105; the photograph: p.104.\nHenry Glassie, Folk Housing in Middle Virginia, U Tennessee Press, 1975; plans, drawings and photographs by Henry Glassie.\nHenry Glassie recorded floor plans and what history he could find, He photographed. He did not make measured drawings like those in HABS at the Library of Congress. website"", ""The Intersection of Euclid & Eratosthenes\nIn order to understand how the intersection of Euclid and Eratosthenes led to the first estimate of the Earth's circumference (with remarkable accuracy!), we looked in detail at Euclid's Proposition 29 which states that:\nIf two straight lines are parallel, then a straight line that meets them makes the alternate angles equal, it makes the exterior angle equal to the opposite interior angle on the same side, and it makes the interior angles on the same side equal to two right angles.\nTogether, we broke down the statement to identify each part and students restated the definition using the names of lines and angles from an example diagram to make sure the statement made sense to them before we moved forward.\nLine a falling on line b and line c makes:\nUsing our understanding of Euclid's Proposition 29, we were then able to see how Eratosthenes applied this principle (and excellent critical thinking skills) to obtain his famous estimate of Earth's circumference.\nEratosthenes knew that in Syene, which is located in southern Egypt, the Sun at noon on the summer solstice shines down to the bottom of a well. He also knew that at noon on this, the longest day of the year, objects do not cast shadows. However, in Alexandria, which is farther north, at noon on the summer solstice, he noticed that objects do cast shadows.\nEratosthenes used this simple observation to calculate the circumference of the Earth. He assumed that 1) the Sun's rays strike the Earth in parallel lines, and 2) that the Earth is round (recall, not everyone at this time and for many years to come believed in a round Earth!). The approach he used was to measure the distance between Syene and Alexandria based on the number of steps someone took to walk between the two cities. He then measured the shadow cast by a stick placed vertically in the ground at Alexandria at noon on the summer solstice. He measured the angle from the stick to the shadow and found it be 7.5 degrees, or approximately one-fiftieth of a circle. Since Eratosthenes was familiar with Euclid's work and The Elements, he knew that the angle of the shadow cast by the pole is equal to the angle at the Earth's center between Syene and Alexandria. By multiplying the distance from Syene to Alexandria times 50, Eratosthenes was able to calculate the circumference of the Earth with amazing accuracy! At that time, distance was measured in stadia. The distance between the two cities was approximated to be 5,000 stadia which is equivalent to about 800 km, or 500 miles. Eratosthenes estimated the circumference of Earth to be 25,000 miles - that's within 2% of our current best estimates!\nFinal Projects and Homework\nDuring the last 15 minutes of class students worked independently on a review/test which covers concepts from Chapters 14-18 in the textbook. We will go over the answers together in class next week.\nI met with each student individually to discuss their ideas for a final science fair project. It looks like we will have a great variety of topics covered and I'm looking forward to seeing where the students take their ideas and what they will create for final presentations!\nFor homework this week, I would like students to prepare a one-paragraph description of their project and the approach they plan to take - you will need to hand these in to me on Monday. This will help ensure that everyone has clearly thought out and can articulate their project. Please take time this week to think through what you will research, build, and present (visually and orally) to the class. We have only a few short weeks left in the semester and everyone should have a definite project idea and be moving forward. Any questions or concerns, I am here to help you, so please don't hesitate to contact me.\nAdditionally, students should read Chapters 20 and 21 in the text.\nSee you next week!""]"	['<urn:uuid:61ff1800-7242-49bb-9dac-571dae81828e>', '<urn:uuid:dc43acc5-9717-4677-a84d-8d1f3b94dca2>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	9	39	1457
88	I'm researching clothing restrictions in religious contexts - how does the biblical prohibition on cross-dressing compare to the dress codes for Jewish priests in ancient times?	The biblical prohibition on cross-dressing (Deuteronomy 22:5) had multiple interpretations - Philo saw it as maintaining gender distinctions, Josephus viewed it as preventing battlefield confusion, and rabbis interpreted it as preventing promiscuity. In contrast, the Jewish priests' dress code was very specific and focused on ritual function rather than gender - they wore distinctive items including a tunic (ketōnet), sash (avnēt), linen pants (miknese-bad), and headgear (migb'ah). The priestly garments resembled Persian/Parthian attire, with pants and waist-tied tunics, which made them stand out since regular Jews dressed like other Mediterranean peoples.	['This month, for the first time in a while, the group Women of the Wall managed to pray at the Western Wall without any serious incidents (here is a news report of the gathering). The group’s goal, in addition to simply conducting a meaningful prayer service at the Western Wall, is to advocate for equal treatment of men and women at the site. While there are many issues in play here (e.g., currently women are discouraged from singing “too loudly” at the Wall and prohibited from reading from a Torah scroll), one of the real hot-button issues has been the right for women to wear a tallit, or prayer-shawl, particularly those that look “manly.”\nAccording to the rabbi who sets the rules at the Wall (and whose decisions are enforced by the regular Israel police force), one of the primary reasons why women are not allowed to wear masculine-looking prayer shawls at the Wall is that women are not allowed to wear any “man’s garment” (e.g., pants) from the Torah:\nA woman shall not wear a man’s apparel, nor shall a man put on a woman’s garment; for whoever does such things is abhorrent to the Lord your God.” (Deuteronomy 22:5)\nThe reason behind this stricture is hardly obvious. Why should such an activity be forbidden? The Bible itself doesn’t tell us and it mystified Jews even in antiquity. In the first century BCE-CE, the Jewish philosopher Philo wrote:\nSo earnestly and carefully does the law desire to train and exercise the soul to manly courage that it lays down rules even about the kind of garment which should be worn. It strictly forbids a man to assume a woman’s garb, in order that no trace, no merest shadow of the female, should attach to him to spoil his masculinity…. In the same way he trained the woman to decency of adornment and forbade her to assume the dress of a man, with the further object of guarding against the mannish-woman as much as the womanish-man. He knew that as in buildings, if one of the foundation stones is removed, the rest will not remain as they were. (Philo, On the Virtues, 18, 21, translation Loeb Classical Library)\nFor Philo, then, the purpose of the law is to instill in its followers a sense of gender difference. Dress is one of a complex of behaviors that define the “natural” gender roles decreed by God.\nWriting several decades later, though, the Jewish historian Josephus understood the intention behind the law quite differently. As he pithily relates it:\nBeware, above all in battle,, that no woman assume the accoutrements of a man nor a man the apparel of a woman” (Josephus Antiquities 4.301, translation Loeb Classical Library)\nFor Josephus, the purpose of the law appears to be practical: it is so that in battle men and women would not be confused with each other. Thus confusion might lead especially to the killing of women, but also for men would serve as a kind of unfair disguise.\nThe rabbis, though, have yet another interpretation:\nHere is the heart of the matter: A woman should not dress like a man and then go among the men, and a man should not ornament himself like a woman and then go among the women.\nRabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: How do we know that a woman a woman should not put on battle clothes and go forth to war? Because it is written, “a woman shall not wear a man’s clothing…” (Sifre Deuteronomy 226)\nFor the anonymous writers, the reason for the prohibition is the fear of promiscuity. Were it not for this prohibition we could expect women to sneak into places where men congregate and vice-versa, a situation that would inevitably lead to illicit relations.\nI suspect that the rabbi of the Western Wall is not seriously concerned that women who wear tallitot will use them to slip into the men’s section undectected so that they can cavort with them. Nor, of course, is there any concern for battle. So that, curiously, leave Philo’s rationale that improper dress can destroy personal virtue. (A side thought: I wonder how the authorities would respond to a man who attempts to pray there in a “feminine” tallit.)\nHowever the prohibition is justified today, though, it is intriguing to note that our puzzlement over it is nothing new.', 'By: Joan E. Taylor\nIn antiquity, as today, ritual experts of various kinds were distinguished by dress that marked them off as engaged in sacred duties. In ancient Rome a priest of the imperial cult, the flamen, wore flame-coloured clothing with a remarkable apex-pointed skullcap. The Roman Catholic clerical collar, the Eastern Christian cassock, and the robes of Buddhist monks all serve the same functions today.\nBut when we consider what the priests wore in the Jewish Temple of Jerusalem, we have no clear pictorial representations, because most Jews through to the second century understood the biblical prohibitions on images (Exodus 20:3–6; Leviticus 26:1; Numbers 33:52; Deuteronomy 4:16; 27:15) to mean that there should be no image of humans.What we have, instead, are descriptions, and on the basis of these descriptions we have to imagine what priests (kohanim) wore, using analogies, insofar as these might be useful.\nDescriptions of priestly dress are found in Exodus 28–29; Leviticus 6:10; 16:4, and Ezekiel 44:17–20. In Exodus 28, there is a description of the sacred vestments required for the High Priest Aaron, after which there is a summary of the clothing of Aaron’s sons, the ordinary priests:\n40 For Aaron’s sons you shall make tunics (kuttonot) and sashes (avnētim) and items of headgear (migba`ot); you shall make them for their fine adornment.\n41 You shall put them on Aaron your brother, and on his sons with him, and shall anoint them and lay hands on them and consecrate them, so that they may be priests for me.\n42 You shall make for them linen pants (miknese-bad) to cover their naked flesh; they shall be from the hips to the thighs; …\n43 Aaron and his sons shall wear them when they go into the tent of meeting, or when they come near the altar to minister in the holy place; and they will not bring built and die. This shall be everlasting for him and for his descendants after him.\nThis provides us with a number of distinctive items of dress, with Hebrew terms: (1) a tunic, a ketōnet, (2) a sash or girdle, avnēt, (3) linen pants, miknese-bad, and (4) an item of headgear, migb`ah, which is called a pe`er in Ezek. 44:18. These items were only worn by priests when doing their duties in the Temple.\nBut what were these exactly? Did priestly fashion change over time? Helpfully, in the third — second century BCE the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek, the Septuagint (LXX), and analogous Greek words were found.The ketōnet is defined as a chitōn (Gk.), which for a man would normally be a short tunic. The ‘avnēt is a zōnē (Gk.), which is anything you tie around the body like a girdle, sash or belt. The linen breeches/pants are periskelēlina; periskelē generally refers to Persian breeches, and in Greek a kidaris is a type of flat Persian turban (see Herodotus, Hist. 8:120).\nThus, the Septuagint’s Greek words link priestly dress with Persian attire. Persians – and in due course the Parthians of northeast Iran – were known to wear pants and waist-tied tunics, with capes clasped with a brooch, along with floppy ‘Phrygian’ caps, as can be seen in the Arch of Septimius Severus in Rome.\nSo what the Septuagint indicates is that priestly dress was quite Persian/Parthian-looking. Importantly, Josephus – himself a priest – described in detail what he knew priests to wear in his own day. In a passage that is not always well-translated (Antiquities 3:151–58) he tells of how the priest’s feet are put through a linen girdle, diazōma, ‘as into pants/breeches (anaxurides)’. The lower parts are bound to the bottom of the thighs, around the knees. Herodotus also uses the word anaxurides to refer to the trousers of Persians or Parthians (Hist. 5:49; 7:61).\nJosephus describes the headgear as a pilos, a helmet, though this is a word often used for felted cloth. The combination of a helmet of felted cloth and a coronet does not correspond to anything worn in the Graeco-Roman world: it parallels the tiara of Parthian rulers like Mithridates II or Mithridates III, headgear which developed out of a Persian kyrbasía felt or leather bonnet, worn with a diadem or two.\nIt is usually assumed that the Romans simply depicted the Judaean here as a Parthian, as a kind of one-size-fits-all ‘conquered rebel’ type. Clearly, the figure looks like a subjugated (enslaved) Parthian as found in the statues of the public Gardens of Sallust. If in Greek texts Jewish priestly attire is presented as being rather Persian or Parthian in appearance, this might also explain a puzzling image on Roman coins commemorating victory over the Judaean revolt. The coin type has Titus on the obverse and a Judaean kneeling under a Roman trophy on the reverse.\nHowever, while the man on the coin is bearded (another way to signify his being a type of Barbarian) and wears pants, there is no distinctively Phrygian cap, and the man’s upper torso appears to be naked. But a Parthian’s garment was tied at the waist and wide, relative to the standard tunic of the Graeco-Roman world, making it appear as a ‘dress’. He is therefore not quite a Parthian. In fact, viewers are supposed to ‘get’ that this man on the coin is a Judaean, when there is no date palm (symbol of Judaea) to identify him, or the words IUDAEA CAPTA (for the literate), as we find on other coinage.\nThe question is: How is he then recognisably a Judaean? The Romans had standard ethnic stereotypes in their iconography, in the same way as a cartoon today will portray a Scotsman in tartan kilt, or a Frenchman with a beret.Yet here people had to recognize that the man represented is not a Parthian, but rather a Judaean, or else the propagandistic message would be lost.\nThere was no great victory over Parthians during the Flavian dynasty to which Titus belonged. Rome was at peace with the Parthians and would not show them humiliated: the Parthian king Vologeses even offered Titus a golden crown (stephanos) of victory for his quashing of the Judaean revolt. What the Romans were representing on the coin is someone who was Parthian-like, but not Parthian.\nThe trouble is that in general Jews (Judaeans) just looked like everyone else. As Shaye Cohen has noted, there is not a single comment in the whole of Graeco-Roman literature that describes any specifics of Jewish appearance (apart from male circumcision, which could not, as a rule, be seen). Jews were not even identifiable in terms of male beardedness.Cohen points to certain rulers who wanted Jews to wear distinctive clothing to mark them out as different when they were otherwise indistinguishable. Textiles found in Masada and the Judaean desert caves indeed indicate that Jews wore exactly the same garments as elsewhere in the Mediterranean world. And there is not a single example of Parthian-like pants.\nIn my view,the coin image defines the kneeling figure by the one distinctive type of dress Judaeans had: their ‘Parthian-like’ priestly dress. This was revealed to Romans because there had recently been a Judaean ‘fashion show’ in Rome; Josephus describes how in the Roman triumph procession in 71 CE there were captives dressed in diverse garments (War 7:138):\nBesides these, you could not help but see that the throng of captives was not unadorned, but the variety of the garments, and the beauty of these, hid from sight the suffering of their bodies.\nSince the clothing of priests is described by Josephus as beautiful and was the most exotic Judaean dress a Roman would see, captured priests in their distinctive attire were surely on display, alongside the looted holy artefacts of the Temple as depicted on the Arch of Titus in Rome.\nTherefore, the coin, with its ‘Parthian-like’ Judaean subject, aimed to show the Jewish priesthood itself subjugated to Rome. The Judaean wears miknese-bad, breeches. The avnēt (wound sash) is portrayed as a kind of scarf, undone and hanging down the back, tied at the end. The ketōnet (chiton) is not shown, perhaps so that the distinctive breeches can be emphasized, but a priest without his chiton would be one partially stripped and thus humiliated. He seems to have something around his head, thus the distinctive migb`ah, not a Phyrgian cap. A shamed and bound Jewish priest of the destroyed Temple, bowing his knee to the Roman trophy, would then serve aptly as imperial Roman propaganda, matching the Arch of Titus.\nLastly, I mention a curious mystery about Titus and the Temple. According to Josephus, Titus ordered his soldiers not to destroy the Temple, but they did it anyway (War 6:220–270). However, according to a lost history of Tacitus (Hist. Frag. 2), summarized by Sulpicius Severus, while some advised Titus not to, Titus himself ordered the Temple’s destruction, since he wished to strike a huge blow against Jewish religion.The coin itself, depicting a humiliated and bound Jewish priest subjugated below a Roman trophy, might well be called as evidence of Titus’s animus..\nFor further reading\nG.

Mining quartz, like other minerals, can lead to environmental impacts including erosion, loss of biodiversity, and contamination of soil, groundwater and surface water by chemicals from mining processes.	"['EARTH SCIENCE LAB\nMineral Physical Properties and Identification\nMinerals are defined as naturally occurring, inorganic, solids with a definite chemical composition and a regular, internal crystalline structure. The keys to this definition are the chemical composition and the crystalline structure. Different chemical compositions result in different minerals. A good example is the mineral plagioclase. Plagioclase is a member of the feldspar group, but there is more than one type of plagioclase. Albite and anorthite are two examples. Albite has a chemical composition of NaAlSi3O8, while anorthite\'s chemical composition is CaAl2Si2O8. Very similar, but different - therefore two different minerals.\nDifferent crystalline structures, or how the atoms and molecules are arranged, result in different minerals. A good example is diamond and graphite. Both minerals are composed of carbon (C). The same chemical composition, but two different crystalline structures - therefore, two different minerals.\nDetermination of the actual chemical composition and crystalline structure of a mineral is difficult without the proper equipment. In an introductory level lab it is impossible for us to determine these two aspects of a mineral. Fortunately, these two aspects determine a mineral\'s physical properties. How the atoms and molecules are arranged and the strength of the bonding between the atoms result in different physical properties for different minerals. While many minerals share common physical properties, when all of a mineral\'s physical properties are examined, it often results in a unique set of physical properties which can be used to identify the mineral.\nBelow you will find a chart which defines the physical properties and provides the means for determining the physical property of a mineral sample. These definitions and methods are simplified. Consult your lab manual for detailed discussion.\n|Mineral Physical Properties Chart|\n|Cleavage||Breakage of a mineral along planes of weakness in the crystal structure.||Examine the mineral for areas where the mineral is broken. Look for areas where the light reflects from planar surfaces. This can be easily confused with a crystal face and is the most difficult properties for students to master.|\n|Color||Visible light spectrum radiation reflected from a mineral.||Look at the sample and determine its color - white, black, green, clear, etc.|\n|Crystal Form||Geometric shape of a crystal or mineral.||Examine and describe the geometric shape of the mineral - cubic, hexagonal, etc. Not commonly seen in most introductory lab samples.|\n|Fracture||Breakage of a mineral, not along planes of weakness in the crystral structure.||Examine the mineral for areas where the mineral is broken. Describe the breakage as either irregular or conchoidal (has the appearance of broken glass)|\n|Hardness||Resistance to scratching or abrasion.||Use minerals of known hardness from the Mohs Hardness Kits. Scratch the unknown mineral with a known hardness to determine which mineral is harder. Continue doing this with harder or softer minerals from the kit until the hardness is determined.|\n|Luster||Character of the light reflected by a mineral.||Look at the sample to determine if the mineral is metallic in appearance (looks like a chunk of metal) or non-metallic (doesn\'t look like a chunk of metal).|\n|Magnetism||Electromagnetic force generated by an object or electrical field.||Use a magnet to determine if the magnet is attracted to the sample.|\n|Reaction to HCl||Chemical interaction of hydrochloric acid and calcium carbonate (CaCO3).||Place one small drop of HCl on a sample a watch for a reaction - effervesces (bubbles).\nClick here to see an short animation (351 Kb)\n|Specific Gravity||Ratio of the mass of a mineral to the mass of an equal volume of water.||Generally not determined in an introductory lab.

(not recommended in an introductory lab - you don\'t know who has handled or licked the sample before you).|\n|Other Properties||Fluorescence, Radioactivity||Requires special equipment such as a UV lamp and geiger counter. These are not commonly tested for in an introductory lab.|\nBelow is a table listing some of the aspects of the common lab minerals. This table is not a complete listing of all of the physical properties for each mineral. It is designed to highlight those physical properties that are unique to that mineral or assist in identification of that mineral. Be aware that not all mineral samples will necessarily show these physical properties. For example, all plagioclase has cleavage. The sample you examine may or may not show that cleavage. All minerals have a crystal form. However, rarely do introductory mineral samples show a good crystal form. Some types of minerals rarely show a crystal form and even museum collections may not contain good examples of a mineral\'s crystal form.\n|Mineral Identification - Diagnostic Physical Properties|\n|Apatite||Green color, H=5, may show hexagonal crystal form|\n|Augite||Dark or dull green color, 2 cleavages at ~90 degrees, similar properties to Hornblende|\n|Biotite||Black color, one perfect direction of cleavage resulting in the mineral pealing into thin, flexible sheets, similar properties to Muscovite|\n|Calcite||H=3, reacts with HCl, 3 directions of cleavage (rhombic cleavage)|\n|Corundum||H=9, often shows hexagonal crystal form|\n|Dolomite||Reacts to HCL in its powdered form, similar properties to calcite|\n|Fluorite||H=4, 4 directions of cleavage, often purple in color (can be white, clear, yellow, green)|\n|Galena||Gray, metallic mineral, 3 directions of cleavage (cubic)|\n|Garnet||Typically reddish brown color, no cleavage, commonly found in twelve-sided crystals (dodecahedrons)|\n|Graphite||""Pencil lead"", soft metallic mineral, gray streak|\n|Gypsum||H=2, can be scratched with a fingernail|\n|Halite||""Salt"", H=2.5, cannot be scratched with a fingernail, 3 directions of cleavage (cubic), salty taste|\n|Hematite||Reddish brown streak, ""rust""|\n|Hornblende||Black to dk. green color, 2 directions of cleavage at 120 or 60 degrees, similar properties to Augite|\n|Magnetite||Magnetic, metallic mineral|\n|Muscovite||Clear or translucent color, one perfect direction of cleavage resulting in the mineral pealing into thin, flexible sheets, similar properties to Biotite|\n|Olivine||Apple green or yellowish green color, H=7 (often difficult to determine), conchoidal fracture, no cleavage|\n|Orthoclase||H=6, salmon pink color is typical, perthitic intergrowths are common, 2 directions of cleavage at 90 degrees, similar properties to plagioclase|\n|Plagioclase||H=6, white or gray color, striations may be seen on cleavage surface, 2 directions of cleavage at 90 degrees, similar properties to orthoclase|\n|Pyrite||""Fool\'s Gold"", gold metallic color|\n|Quartz||H=7, conchoidal fracture, no cleavage, color is typically white or clear but can be pink, red, purple, black|\n|Sulfur||Yellow color, ""rotten egg"" smell if burned|\n|Talc||H=1, very soft, easily scratched by fingernail|\nOn each of the following pages you will find an image of a mineral and a series of physical properties tests.

90	sealing documents food preservation ancient storage methods security protection techniques explain	Ancient sealing and food preservation methods both served protective functions. Document sealing provided security by requiring the seal to be broken to access the contents, authenticating the sender's identity through unique seal patterns, and protecting against unauthorized access - as demonstrated in biblical examples like sealing the lion's den door. Similarly, food preservation methods protected food from spoilage through various techniques: storing grain in ceramic pots, using salt to inhibit bacterial growth (requiring up to 20% salt concentration), smoking meat, and utilizing sugar to create environments hostile to microorganisms. Both systems used physical barriers (seals/containers) and specific materials (wax/salt/sugar) to protect their contents.	"['In ancient times a seal or signet was an instrument, often metal or stone, with an engraved pattern or design on it. It would be pressed into a softer material, usually wax or clay leaving an imprint like a stamp.\nA seal affixed to a document (usually on a scroll) would have to be broken in order to unroll the document and read it. This meant it was in one way like today\'s ""tamper-resistent seals"" on packages. But it also was used to verify the authenticity of who sent a letter, especially a king\'s decree, because it would have the King\'s special stamp on it, similar to what we might use a signature for today. Handing over a signet ring would be symbolic way of allowing someone else to act on your behalf with your authority. However, sealing has both literal and figurative uses in the bible. Things besides just documents could be sealed. The door to the lion\'s den was ""sealed"" to prevent unauthorized entrance after it was shut. Jeremiah sealed the deeds of the field which he bought from Hanamel as a symbol of formal radification of his transaction. In the more figurative sense, it could also be used ""for the act or token of authentication, confirmation, proof, security or possession."" (ISBE)\nThayer\'s lexicon enumerates the various uses of ἐσφραγίσθητε to include:\n(1) to set a seal upon, mark with a seal, to seal\n(1a) for security: from Satan\n(1b) since things sealed up are concealed (as the contents of a letter), to hide, keep in silence, keep secret\n(1c) in order to mark a person or a thing\n(1c1) to set a mark upon by the impress of a seal or a stamp\n(1c2) angels are said to be sealed by God\n(1d) in order to prove, confirm, or attest a thing\n(1d1) to confirm authenticate, place beyond doubt\n(1d1a) of a written document\n(1d1b) to prove one’s testimony to a person that he is what he professes to be\nBut when it comes specifically to this verse in Ephesians, the The International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia suggests the intended meaning is a mark of ownership by God:\nGod by His Spirit indicates who are His, as the owner sets his seal on his property; and just as documents are sealed up until the proper time for opening them, so Christians are sealed up by the Holy Spirit “unto the day of redemption” (Eph. 1:13; Eph. 4:30; 2Co. 1:22).\nOr to quote Albert Barnes:\n""Christians are said to be sealed; to be sealed by the Holy Spirit Eph. 1:13; Eph. 4:30; that is, the Holy Spirit is given to them to confirm them as belonging to God...God grants to them His Holy Spirit as the certain pledge that they are His, and shall be approved and saved in the last day.""\nAlso note that in this verse, to seal is in the first aorist passive voice/tense. This means the subject (you, which is really us) is being acted upon, and that it happened in the past and is a completed action. The spirit is in the instrumental case, which indicates it is the means by which this action was done upon us (""how or ""by means of""), the Holy Spirit in essense, IS the seal.\nThe Scofield Bible has a useful footnote on this verse:\n""The Holy Spirit is Himself the seal. In the symbolism of Scripture a seal signifies (1) A finished transaction (Jer. 32:9, 10; John 17:4, 19:30), (2) Ownership (Jer. 32:11, 12; 2 Tim. 2:19), (3) Security (Esth. 8:8; Dan. 6:17; Eph. 4:30).""\nThe sealing is completed, we are marked as property of God via it, and can be secure in that marking.', 'Organic Food Preservation Definition, Importance, & Methods\nFood preservation has long been a necessary pursuit of humans through the ages. While short term food preservation methods are largely dominated by today’s refrigerators, and long term preservation is dominated by canning or freezing, our ancient cultures thrived without such technology by collecting, drying and storing grain in large ceramic pots. Hunter-gatherers preserved meat and fish by air drying or smoking. Salt and sugar, when readily available, were also used as a preservative.\nPreserving food without canning or freezing or refrigerators?\nCountless methods and technologies of food preservation have been attempted through the millennia and a few tried and true methods that are natural and sustainable have been passed through generations. These techniques are part of food preservation history are of course, organic, and still applicable and useful in modern sustainable living.\nPreserving meat through drying.\nThis most ancient form of food preservation is simply the removal of water from any given food by air drying, sun drying, or smoking. Commercially available food dehydrators or a home oven can also be used to preserve food. Nearly all foods can be preserved through drying including meat (jerky), grains, fruits, vegetables, fungi, and even milk. Smoking, is part of the food drying method.\nCuring is a method of preserving food, most often meat and fish, by the addition of salt, nitrates, or sugar. Salt-cured meat works by inhibiting the growth of microorganisms by drawing water out of cells through osmosis. Concentrations of salt up to 20% are required to kill most species of bacteria and smoking the meat adds additional chemicals that reduce the amount of salt required. Common examples of salt-cured meat include bacon, kippered herring, corned beef, and pastrami. Olives, pictured above, are easily preserved through the salt curing method as well.\nSugaring is a method that places dehydrated food into pure sugar. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microorganisms. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits and their peels as well as spices such as ginger root.\nAlso known as brining, pickling is the process of preserving food by anaerobic fermentation in brine (a solution of salt in water) to produce lactic acid, or marinating and storing it in an acid solution such as vinegar. The resulting food is called a pickle and can be any variety of food item including eggs, peppers, cucumbers, or even citrus fruits.\nThe use of nontoxic and beneficial microorganisms can also preserve food. An ancient form of bio-preservation is fermentation which was, and still is, used to produce beer, wine, vinegar, bread, yogurt, cheese, and butter. All of these items can still be produced in the home kitchen using biopreservation techniques.\nFor short term food preservation methods, simple technologies such as the zeer pot, submersion in water (such as a lake or river) and the use of cool caves or underground pits extend the expiration of many perishable foods. These techniques of course can be employed today as well, some more fitting in certain climates than others. -KATHY FAIRCHILD']"	['<urn:uuid:60d7e0fb-8384-42de-916c-f29d7a471664>', '<urn:uuid:263d2c1b-5823-42bd-b845-c8cbcfca9ace>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	11	103	1127

92	poetry events harvard square location	Poems2go has hosted in-person events such as poetry readings and discussions at the Grolier Poetry Bookshop in Harvard Square.	"['While traveling in Cuba, Christine Bess Jones and her husband met someone who shared a poem that was in his pocket, Robert Creeley’s “Kore.”\nHis act inspired Christine, a graduate of the MFA in Creative Writing program, to write her own poem about the experience and to learn more about the origin of this traveling art form.\nChristine gave the book, Poem in Your Pocket: 200 Poems to Read and Carry, to several friends to further an artistic conversation about mobile poetry, and went on to found poems2go, expanding on the idea of individual pocket poetry by partnering with libraries, small businesses and poets to make poetry accessible to the public.\n“My mission for poems2go is to bring more poetry to more people in more places, to make it accessible to poets and non-poets alike,” she says.\nFeaturing five poets a month, the poems2go initiative offers printed copies of poems in local bookstores, cafes and libraries, free of charge for anyone to take with them, whether they tuck them away for individual inspiration or share with others. ""Tuck in your pocket, your wallet, your heart,” is the tagline.\n“Active engagement with the language of poetry allows for transformation of thought to occur,” Christine says. “This transformation leads to a greater perspective about our interconnectedness and our place in the collective whole.”\nFunded by a grant from The Witter Bynner Foundation for Poetry, poems2go has expanded from five to 13 locations—from Massachusetts and Rhode Island to Tennessee and Florida. Its popularity is fueled, in part, by poetry’s unique position to create powerful conversations, according to Christine, who lives in Billerica, Mass. and Cape Cod.\n“I believe poetry needs to be held, mulled over, stored and shared,” she says. “One can be initially attracted to a poem because of its sound or its imagery, but when read further, more keenly and sensitively, associations can be made. We are associative beings. It is our natural inclination to make connections.”\nThrough the poems2go website and copies of poems at participating venues, the word is spreading. Poems2go has also hosted in-person events such as readings and discussions at the Grolier Poetry Bookshop in Harvard Square. Poetry readings have included Lesley creative writing faculty members Sharon Bryan and Teresa Cader as well as local poet Julie Ann Otis.\nTapping the power of public art\nChristine has a vision for how this work impacts the community and what might be possible when public art is made available to anyone, anywhere. When considering businesses with which to partner, she considers factors such as previous working relationships and whether the location would be a good fit for the group’s message.\n“I reached out first to venues I had a connection to, and then to venues I respected and wished to see the project being promoted from, such as Grolier Poetry Bookshop and Porter Square Books,” she explains. “I seek businesses that are genuine in spirit, and wish to promote art/poetry.”\nShe sets a similar standard for submissions from local, national and international poets who send work to be considered.\n“What I look for in a poem is a poet’s underlying gesture that demonstrates a deep listening and response to the world, immediate or abroad, past or future,” she says.\nConnecting with Lesley poets\nChristine graduated from Lesley’s low residency Creative Writing MFA program in January 2016 and frequently collaborates with her former classmates and Lesley faculty members for poetry submissions and poems2go events including Teresa Cader, Sharon Bryan, Kevin Prufer, Cate Marvin and Erin Belieu.\nClassmate Michael Mercurio has also been featured on poems2go’s website and local cafes.\n“Christine had set the wheels in motion for poems2go before I met her, and I remember her talking about it during a workshop in my first semester,” Michael recalls. “Having the poems available in places where people would encounter them breaks down one of the barriers preventing access to poems.\n“It’s fun to see one of my poems out in the wild, too,” he adds.\nAnother Lesley classmate, Sarah Lain, has joined the initiative to help with reading submissions, and to serve as a poems2go ambassador to the St. Petersburg, Fla. area in hopes of furthering the project’s reach. Poems2go is a way to access a medium that is not easy for all people to understand.\n“Poetry has a way of slipping past the fastidious, organized mind; it is language that transforms the reader whether the reader knows it or not,” Michael says. “A poem is entirely unlike any other written document—it abides by its own logic, making use of sound and association to create something vivid that will, with any luck, shake the reader awake.”']"	['<urn:uuid:f80681c9-1171-49f0-93e3-cc03a3fdb5f0>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	5	19	775
93	green construction key advantages energy health money	Using sustainable construction practices offers multiple key benefits. From an energy perspective, proper insulation and high-quality windows minimize energy consumption and associated costs. For occupant health, using materials with minimal chemical emissions and preventing mold growth creates better indoor air quality. Financially, sustainable practices reduce maintenance and replacement costs over the building's lifetime through durable materials and efficient systems. Additionally, implementing proper air barriers, flashing systems, and integrated design approaches helps maximize building longevity while minimizing energy consumption.	"[""for Beijing Materials in Beijing Multi-family Dwellings\nProblems to address:\nContext and Approach:\nThe selection and use of building materials,\nin particular for large scale housing projects will have significant\nenergy, cost, and comfort implications. The impact of the current\nand imminent growth in China's construction sector represents a\npotential new prominence in world resource consumption.\nCareful and creative selection of materials\nand design and detailing of installation can significantly mitigate\nthis impact. The use of renewable materials should be given preference\nto the use of non-renewables. Reusable and recyclable materials\nshould be give preference to non-recyclable, non-reusable materials.\nConsideration should be given to the project's role in carbon dioxide\nchains; outputs and inputs should be balanced. Designs must be reasonably\nconstructable; the need to import either labor or materials should\nbe minimized and limited to those resources that have significant\nThe building envelope, its walls and roof, should\nbe instrumental in minimizing the consumption of non-renewable resources\nduring the life of the building. This will minimize negative impacts\nof fuel usage including operational costs.\nThe team recognizes potential risks and\nbenefits of the current transition to occupant ownership. The environmental\nrisks include: The effect of larger units, and the resultant per\ncapita material and energy consumption; Comfort zone evolution to\na more limited region that may will require more responsive buildings\nand HVAC systems; The decentralization of knowledge base to the\nmarket eliminates the potential for a unified approach The associated\nbenefits include the owner's increased stake in their dwellings\nmay lead to improved maintenance due to onsite care taking and responsibility.\nAlso, the potential of decentralized knowledge base may provide\nmeans to implement new solutions.\nReturn to top\n- AC units: Individual units are not efficient,\nand typically are not carefully installed. Energy inefficiency\nis compounded by air infiltration through unsealed condensate\nand electric lines. Water leakage may present a long-term durability\nand maintenance issue near these interruptions in the façade.\n- Lack of insulation. There is conflicting\ninformation regarding the use of insulation in existing and\nrecent construction. Insulating value is typically attributable\nto clay or masonry materials that have very high thermal conductivity.\nTheir advantage in thermal lag are advantageous only when mean\ndiurnal temperatures are in the comfort zone. Therefore insulation\nwill be beneficial in most regions. The industry is currently\nunaccustomed to designing insulated walls.\n- Window construction: Typical systems are\nsingle glazed and leaky (loose-fitting). According to the Ministry\nof Construction, windows and doors account for 50% of energy\nloss in Chinese buildings.\n- Effective use of concrete: As the transition\ncontinues from clay-brick to concrete construction, the overuse\n/over design of concrete structures poses a significant environmental\nhazard due to its large embodied energy and the significant\nvolumes of carbon dioxide emitted during its manufacture.\n- Loss of agricultural land due to clay mining.\nApparently, 10,000 hectares of farmland is destroyed annually\nto make clay brick. The apparent alternative is concrete blocks.\nThis technology is, like clay brick, also high in embodied energy.\n- Integrated design approach: Holistic thinking\nshould be the first consideration in improving the quality of\nhousing. Integrating the consideration of materials with the\nplanning of mechanical systems can eliminate aesthetic problems\nwhile avoiding damaging moisture penetration and energy consuming\nair infiltration. A similar approach may be taken in the planning\nand detailing of window openings. Vast improvements may be made\non each of these fronts by complete planning and rigorous follow-through\n- Windows: A lot of money can be spent improving\nthe quality of windows. High-tech solutions are available globally\nthat would provide a radical improvement on the energy losses\nand associated discomfort related to leaky windows. However,\nimporting technology shouldn't be considered as the only solution,\nor even necessarily the best solution. Importation suggests\nexporting jobs and money, and requires the expenditure of time,\nmoney and energy for the transport of products. If windows are\nto be imported, consideration should be given to purchasing\nonly frame stock. This will reduce the transportation associated\nwith heavy glass units, while concentrating on accessing the\nhigher-tech and highly engineered frames. The higher quality\nframes will mitigate a majority of the energy and comfort issues\nif installed correctly.\n- Insulation: The most expensive way to insulate\na building is to leave the insulation out of the building. The\nresultant energy consumption of buildings without insulation\nis more expensive than simply putting insulation in the wall\nto begin with. The most effective location for building insulation\nis on the outside of the structure where it can be run past\nthe floor slabs, creating a continuous protective layer for\nthe building thereby minimizing thermal bridges.\n- Centralized HVAC systems or planned locations\nand proper sleeves for penetrations.\n- Apply vernacular / regional technologies:\nThe environmental impact of concrete construction can be minimized\nby careful engineering of the structures to avoid wasting material.\nLocal coal-burning power plants should be considered as mines\nfor fly ash, a material that can be used to replace portland\ncement and thereby reduce carbon dioxide emissions of the concrete\n- Air barriers and flashing systems: These\nsystems are proven in their effectiveness to minimize energy\nconsumption and maximize building longevity.\nReturn to top"", 'Sustainability is the process applied to our quest to sustain economic growth while maintaining our long-term environmental health. Sustainability means designing structures that take advantage of technological advancements to create eco-friendly products. Inert-gas-filled insulated windows, engineered-wood products made from scrap wood shavings, sawdust and assorted wood fibers, and thermal break window frames that keep the cold and hot air out are all examples of sustainable products. These products provide the owner and occupants with the following benefits:\n- Reduced maintenance and replacement costs over the life of the building\n- Energy conservation\n- Improved occupant health\n- Productive working environment\nSustainable products incorporated into the building should follow these selection guidelines:\n- Recycled content\n- Natural, plentiful, or renewable materials\n- Products manufactured by a resource-efficient process\n- Locally available products\n- Salvaged, refurbished, or remanufactured products\n- Reusable or recyclable products\n- Durable products\nUsing sustainable materials can also improve the indoor working environment and save money. Consider these advantages:\n- Materials that emit few or no carcinogens or irritants, as demonstrated by the manufacturer’s long-term testing results\n- Minimal chemical emissions from volatile organic compounds (VOC) that out-gas (continue to emit chemical vapors after installation)\n- Moisture-resistant materials that are not easily susceptible to mold growth\n- Materials that are easily maintained and require simple nontoxic cleaners\n- Equipment systems that promote healthy indoor air quality (IAQ) by identifying indoor air pollutants\n- Products and systems that help reduce water consumption\nThe sustainable approach to design would include requirements to do the following:\n- Simplify construction details.\n- Utilize repetitive details and components.\n- Standardize design components.\n- Incorporate accurate dimensions in the design, as some product and material sizes many have been reduced.\n- Simplify building systems so future expansion projects can take advantage of simplified designs or components.\n- Consider occupant safety and worker productivity gains in the new design.\n- Investigate more efficient and environmentally sensitive ways to bring underground utilities into the site with the least disruption to the existing terrain.\n- Consider other ways of disposing of site drainage onsite rather than offsite.\n- Adjust new site contours to provide for a balanced site where no offsite fill or off-site disposal of surplus soils is required.\n- Optimize dimensions to utilize a standard product size.\n- Minimize plumbing pipe and HVAC ductwork bends to reduce liquid and air friction.\n- Select fittings and fasteners that permit quick assembly.\n- Select sealants with the least environmental impact and longest life.\n- Investigate ways to accumulate salvaged and waste materials for recycling.\n- Consider donating surplus materials to a nonprofit organization such as Habitat for Humanity.\n- Deconstruct all existing structures with substantial recoverable materials and dispose of them to recyclers.\nWhen designing a new green structure, a number of goals must be set. The site must meet or exceed standards for sedimentation control and erosion:\n- Prevent the loss of soil during excavation and construction due to surface water drainage; keep dust down and cover large stored piles of earth to prevent wind erosion.\n- Prevent the silting up of existing storm drains in the immediate area by constructing erosion and silt fence enclosures around areas to be excavated.\n- Prevent the siltation of existing nearby streams or waterways by installing erosion and silt fencing around those streams adjacent to areas to be excavated.\n- Protect topsoil piles for reuse. (Topsoil piles are generated early in the construction process as soil is stripped during rough grading operations; respreading is one of the last operations, commencing as landscaping is put in place.)\nThe site utilities should reduce soil erosion during excavation of trenches and contain storm water runoff:\n- Plan infiltration swales and basins during trenching operations to contain surface water.\n- Retain or recharge existing water tables by minimizing site disturbances; leave as many trees as possible; use existing vegetation and retain natural contours.\n- Consider a design to store roof runoff when the building has been completed; it can be used as gray water or reclaimed wastewater.\n- Investigate a small onsite, state-of-the-art treatment plant to recycle reclaimed water.\nAn open-space and landscaping program can accommodate the following:\n- Protect trees during construction; they enhance property values and lower cooling loads.\n- Consider indigenous landscaping; it supports natural wildlife and plantings and lowers the level of irrigation as well as the need to fertilize and apply chemical treatment.\n- Minimize pesticide use by installing weed cloth; use mulches and planting species that create dense planting beds.\nSite -circulation and transportation programs should meet these objectives:\n- Encourage carpooling.\n- Provide areas for people to store bicycles during working hours.\n- Encourage the use of public transportation by instituting a program of incentives.']"	['<urn:uuid:6ff9c928-99be-4d4c-84ae-ffb58a50ba16>', '<urn:uuid:87dc776d-1577-43c5-924a-15b33db12340>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	7	78	1653
94	What were the FDA warning labels added to Cipro over time?	The FDA added multiple warning labels to Cipro and other fluoroquinolones. In 2008, they added a boxed warning (their most serious alert) about tendonitis and tendon rupture. In 2011, they added a second boxed warning about worsening symptoms of myasthenia gravis. Later, they added a warning about peripheral neuropathy, indicating that nerve damage may occur rapidly after taking these drugs and could become permanent, regardless of dosage.	['During the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War, then-Navy corpsman David Ridenhour often browbeat troops in 1st Battalion, 5th Marines to take their medications — the anti-nerve agent pyridostigmine bromide and another pill, new to the market, to prevent anthrax.\nRidenhour took them. And while he doesn’t completely blame his Gulf War illness symptoms on the drugs, he was interested to learn that last summer the Food and Drug Administration toughened its warnings for Ciprofloxacin, or Cipro, saying the potent antibiotic can cause severe and sometimes permanent nerve damage.\nRidenhour has that damage, known as peripheral neuropathy, which manifests as tingling and numbness in his limbs.\n“They told us to start taking the Cipro, and I didn’t know what it was for,” he said. “But I clearly remember being told it was to prevent anthrax. Until then, as far as I knew, anthrax was a sheep disease.”\nIt’s been well documented that the Defense Department stockpiled 30 million doses of Cipro during the Gulf War, and 150,000 troops received anthrax vaccines to prevent infection. But less well known is that during Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm, some troops actually took Cipro in anticipation of an anthrax attack.\nAccording to Marine Corps documents, members of I Marine Expeditionary Force near Jubayl, Shaikh Isa and Bahrain International Airport and elsewhere took Cipro for a week or more as a prophylactic — although it was not approved to prevent or treat anthrax.\nThat approval from the FDA wouldn’t come for nine more years.\n“What gives me nightmares at night is that I feel like I helped poison the guys in my unit,” Ridenhour said in a recent interview with Military Times.\nCipro and other fluoroquinolones — including Levaquin, Avelox and other medications with “flox” in their names — are powerful antimicrobials used to treat serious bacterial infections.\nBut along with potency comes a litany of precautions, warnings and side effects — information that service members and their families should consider when they are prescribed these medications, or when they request them to treat routine infections.\nIn 2008, the FDA added a boxed warning — its most serious alert — to fluoroquinolones, noting they can cause tendonitis and tendon rupture. In 2011, the agency added a second boxed warning, saying the medications can worsen the symptoms of myasthenia gravis.\nAnd while the most recent warning for peripheral neuropathy is not the most severe alert, it is alarming. According to the FDA, nerve damage “may occur soon after these drugs are taken and may become permanent,” and is unrelated to dosage levels.\nThe warning applies to oral medications as well as those delivered by injection.\n“The onset of peripheral neuropathy after starting fluoroquinolone therapy was rapid, often within a few days. In some patients, the symptoms had been ongoing for more than a year despite discontinuation of the fluoroquinolone,” according to the FDA.\nIn 2011, 23 million patients received prescriptions in the U.S. for Cipro and other fluoroquinolones, including 294,069 prescriptions dispensed at Defense Department facilities. From 2009 to 2012, a total of 1.2 million prescriptions for fluoroquinolones were distributed at military treatment facilities.\nCipro has a long history of use in the U.S. military, dating to at least 1989 when it was tested on soldiers in Egypt for travelers’ diarrhea.\nIt was again widely used in the Persian Gulf War, although the number of those who actually took it is not well documented. Former troops who wrote Military Times said they took white pills that they later figured out were Cipro when the drug became more widely recognized and distributed.\n“I’m one of those Marine combat veteran guinea pigs who took those pills,” one former service member wrote. “I’m 100 percent service-connected [VA disability] because of the toxic soup we were exposed to and those damn pills.”\nBiological warfare experts and retired Marine Gen. Walter Boomer, who led I MEF during the Gulf War, said precautions were taken because the threat of an anthrax attack was legitimate.\nBy September 1990, Iraq had achieved industrial-scale production of anthrax, had stockpiled 30 tons of the medium needed to grow more and had shown no reservations about launching chemical attacks on its own people.\n“We viewed [anthrax] with as much seriousness as their potential to use chemical weapons; ... I was presented by [U.S. Central Command] with these options that if we were attacked it would prevent an outbreak, so with that information, it was a fairly simple decision,” Boomer said.\nScientists have spent years trying to determine what may have caused 250,000 Gulf War veterans to develop multiple and often debilitating symptoms after the war.\nBecause symptoms are varied and troops were exposed to a variety of environmental hazards, from oil well fires, pesticides, vaccinations, medications and possibly nerve agents, researchers say it will be difficult to pinpoint a cause.\nBut Ridenhour thinks the recent FDA warning may explain some of his symptoms. “It clearly says ‘peripheral neuropathy,’ and that’s what I have,” he said.\nIn 2000, the FDA approved Cipro to prevent inhalation anthrax after possible exposure, the first antibiotic approved as a treatment in the event of a biowarfare attack.\nDuring the 2001 anthrax attacks, thousands of workers at the U.S. Postal Service, the White House, the U.S. Capitol and elsewhere took Cipro. The Department of Health and Human Services requested enough to provide 12 million people with doses for 60 days.\nWhile Cipro and other fluoroquinolones are widely prescribed, their use has leveled off since 2002. Within DoD, prescriptions for fluoroquinolones actually are waning, down 14 percent since 2009, according to Pentagon data.']	['<urn:uuid:1d0b3543-7cd6-46a2-9e78-d56ab69c20f4>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	11	67	929

96	i am looking for construction projects that use interesting ways to deal with trees compare nationalgalerie museum berlin and ramai hostel tree management	Both projects incorporate existing trees in distinctive ways. The Neue Nationalgalerie – Museum maintains a remarkable tree near Matthaikirchplatz, incorporating it into the design with a gently sloped ramp surrounding it. The Ramai boys hostel preserved multiple existing trees - four Ashoka trees on the south facade, a Fishtail palm on the north-west side which is sustained inside the building, and an Almond tree. The hostel even carved out balconies and inbuilt seating spaces around the existing trees, using them as natural 'picture windows' for the rooms.	['At the heart of the Kulturforum in Berlin, a new museum complex Neue Nationalgalerie – Museum of the 20th Century will enable the collection of the Nationalgalerie, to be presented in an adequate fashion for the first time in decades.\nThe internationally important holdings of the Nationalgalerie of 20th century art, the Marx and Pietsch collections, the Marzona archive and works from the Museum of Prints and Drawings will be permanently and jointly exhibited for the first time.\nThe presentation of the holdings will embrace the lower level of the Neue Nationalgalerie and – first and foremost – the exhibition spaces of the new building.\n1. The Temple with a Chamber.\nA temple of the arts made of glass and steel is carefully choreographed on top of a stone plinth at the edge of the forum. It is a minimalist structural abstraction where space is defined rather than confined; a ground plane, a roof plane and a matrix of columns between the two. A masculine, even austere emptiness that gives access to underground chambers where splendid artistic treasures of the 20th century are concealed.\nThere is hardly any other city in the world more representative of 20th century’s complexity and idiosyncrasies than Berlin. The city is a vibrant yet at times also turbulent flux, rather than just sedimentation, of the last more than one hundred years.\nThe 20th century redefined the world’s social, geo-political and economic powers; it was a turning point in science, technology and the humanities. Art followed its most significant moments of change and was quick in incorporating them as distinct artistic manifestations, and so was Architecture. In the words of Mies van der Rohe, “Architecture is the will of an epoch translated into a space”.\nA museum of the 20th century should translate, in content as in form—or in Art as in Architecture—the collective will of this century, which assisted to an incredible disparity of things: from world wars, to nuclear tensions and new geo-political arrangements; from social emancipations, to cultural liberations and reactionary movements; from Architecture as forms of political power, to politics experienced and represented through Architecture and Art.\n2. A Hole with a Landscape Veil.\nNext to the temple, there is a new hole in the ground. It is an unexpected gap as an act of remembrance amidst a prodigious skyline where architecture has been crafted into 20th century masterpieces. A performance of a structured and structuring emptiness that invites us to look down when everything else pushes up. The hole conceals a soft, gentle landscape veil that offered to the forum, and the city beyond, as a sheltered public park.\nAs one of the European epicentres of change, Berlin has never acted as a passive palimpsest with layers of sedimentation of history, society or culture. Instead, it is a city with healed, yet visible scars in constant flux that do not allow us to forget some of the most meaningful events happening over the course of a century. But remembrance is not simply an act of addition, of construction of a linear progress. Sometimes, it is also a process of scraping, of careful archaeological digging and drilling, of erasure.\nIn the Kulturforum the cultural values of a divided, and then reunited, city crystallised into architectural masterpieces crafted by some of the most representative architects of the 20th century. Progress here has always been aligned with building, with looking up. Conceived as a temple on top of a plinth, the iconic Neue Nationalgalerie is one of these well-orchestrated architectural objects that invite us to look up.\nWhat if the Gallery was articulated with the New Museum through a gesture of polar opposition? When the former goes up emerging as a minimalist abstraction, the latter goes down submerging as a soft, tender and ecologically active landscape veil. When the concealing emptiness of the first creates in the beholder the noble spectacle of awe, the revealing emptiness of the second involves us all in the generous act of dwelling through the democratic form of a public park.\n3. The Museum as an Architectural Skeleton.\nPlugged in to the existing temple, the landscape veil performs a constant action of weaving the hole together with the city above. The tender park, in its entire feminine warm embrace, conceals an architectural skeleton that supports it. A series of wide chambers dig even deeper into the ground to lay the foundations of the new museum. The building conceals to reveal: treasures coming from all around the city may gather here to form an integral art collection representative of the 20th century.\nThe exciting and intense nature of the proposed programme is developed inside a wide architectural skeleton that unfolds over three interconnected underground floors. The architectural language of the building follows a process of deconstruction of a conceptual matrix, through which the many distinct open wide rooms are choreographed as a fluid journey experience.\nFrom the Neue Nationalgalerie a wide staircase brings visitors under Sigmundstrasse, and from Matthaikirchplatz a gently sloped ramp surrounds the remarkable tree, welcoming visitors from the adjacent public space.\nThe building is concealed by the landscape veil almost entirely, with two exceptions: the restaurant, exposed to the redesigned Matthaikirchplatz and the maple tree; and the visitor centre that contacts directly with the new public space weaving the museum with the Philarmonic.\n4. The Beacon and the Viewpoint.\nRising high above the landscape veil, two objects stand out. The beacon drills its way up from the deep quiet chambers below through the new museum and becomes a landmark to the city beyond. A tilted viewpoint offers views to the landscape veil and the temple. Together, they forge visual relationships with Berlin as an ultimate act of compressing the past and the future into the present. Look down, look back, but do not forget to go forward.\nApart from the remarkable tree, the beacon and the viewpoint are the only vertical elements punctuating the park. They forge surprising and distinct relationships of scale, not only with the park and the museum immediately below but also with the forum and the city.\nSeen from the outside and with its impressive height, the beacon becomes a landmark that punctuates the new structured emptiness. From the inside, it conceals a wide hall that welcomes visitors coming down from both entrances and distributes them to the different rooms. Its hollow structure allows the light to penetrate in to the underground floors, thus opening a point of light inside the architectural skeleton. Deep down in the museum, an amphitheatre is carved on the ground, where the beacon’s twisted triangular shape amplifies acoustics.\nOn top of the visitor centre, a slightly tilted viewpoint offers generous views to the park extending south, with the beacon and the remarkable tree, and finally the temple.', 'Excerpt: Ramai boys hostel, designed by Amruta Daulatabadkar Architects, creates an interactive and inward-looking environment in a chaotic residential surrounding for the students to live in.

The key factor in the design process was to enhance students interaction, within the indoor spaces that percolate outward and interact with the landscape around them.\nSite Characteristics: We were blessed with existing trees, four Ashoka trees on the south facade, Fishtail palm on the north-west side (which is sustained inside the building as per design), Almond tree on the north-west corner. All the above trees are sustained.\nClient Brief: To design a boys hostel with maximum utilization of FSI for a commercial output and use of affordable material to make it cost-efficient was the only brief.\nSpatial Orientation and planning: Planning has been made simple, by planning rooms and lobby overlooking the courtyard. And staircase connecting lobby on the x-axis, along with open terrace and courtyard on the y-axis.\nThe Floor plate: The floor plate consists of the plinth, first, second and third level.\n- Plinth- Entrance, office space, watchman room, proposed gym, shop and warden’s room.\n- First floor- Courtyard, rooms\n- Second floor- Rooms\n- Third floor- Rooms, semi-covered terrace and open to sky terrace\nBy carving out small cutouts in similar floorplates from the first floor to terrace slab gives individual identity to the blocks. Shuffling of walls on similar floorplates creates unique layouts of rooms and provides various depths to all side facades. The fenestration of rooms is planned according to existing trees which act as a picture window or visual canvas in the rooms. The Jharokas overlook the courtyard and act as a great source of connectivity within the building. Every room is provided with a balcony overlooking the street as well as a few balconies that provide visual and vocal connection to the users.\nThe Courtyard: (The focal point of the building)\nCourtyard brings in light and ventilation and creates a link between the indoors and the outdoors. It is the heart of the hostel which encircles the activities around it. Entrance, surrounding rooms, jharokhas and lobby spill out to the courtyard, creating a common living and interactive area in the centre. It is covered with a pivoted roof allowing a phenomenal amount of light and ventilation in the place. It is enveloped with a triple storey brick jaali on an external south façade serving as a source of airflow, illumination through jaali and provides thermal comfort.\nLobby: The only 8 ft wide lobby acts also as a passage on every floor. As shown in the plan entrance of all rooms doesn’t open in the lobby space but has a spillover space by shuffling of walls creating inbuilt seating spaces along with planters in the front of the lobby. It has different illustrative paintings finished with acrylic colours on every floor inspired from the elements of the building itself to create illusion and add on to the interiors and a surprise element for the users.\nExisting Trees: The outdoor space attached to rooms has been carved out around the existing tree in the building for balcony and inbuilt seating. The existing trees give an edge to the building making it look primitive around the neighbourhood.\nInteriors: Every room has a different interior layout. The wires running through 1 1/2 – 1 1/2’’ M.S Box sections are customized electrical design, also gets converted into ledges acting as book racks for study tables finished with Kadappa Stone. The play of colours in the wardrobes in rooms break the monotony of raw materials and provide uniqueness.\nMaterial and colour palette: The project captures the gazes with its adornment of locally available clay bricks, whose design in its essence is the fruition of the local material to give a rustic effect. Use simple and locally available material such as – local made clay bricks, Deodar wood, vitrified tiles, Kadappa stone, M.S door frames and windows creates the building elevation and continues in interiors of the building, with the limit of the material like pop and gypsum. Use of basic material to envelope the building with the help of the local team, planning activities and rooms around the existing tree, minimal use of plastered walls, brick jaali, fenestration plan according to the surrounding trees helps connect inner outer spaces as well as existing trees acts as a visual canvas in the rooms and pours in light and ventilation in the building. Walls are treated with a single coat of putty and grey pigment and were scrubbed and finished with a transparent coat to get the concrete effect making it cost-efficient.\nFurniture and accessories;\n1) Pivot Windows– Centrally pivoted slit louvred windows in deodar wood are planned in between the rooms for user interaction.\n2) Wooden Doors– Doors are made up of Deodar wood, which is a combination of fixed and openable louvres for visual and vocal connection. A fixed louvred ventilated panel with a concealed mosquito net is fixed with nails are installed above lintel level.\n4) Wardrobes– The play of colours in the wardrobes in the rooms break the monotony of raw materials and provide uniqueness.\n5) Study Tables- Study tables are customized on-site with ms legs and locally available Kadappa top.\n6) Beds- Beds are customized on-site in ms box sections.\n1) Pivoted Roof– The courtyard with a centrally m.s pivoted roof helps in light and ventilation as well as in the common spaces.\n2) Brick Jaali Wall– The Perforated brick jaali on the south facade allows natural airflow and ventilation.\n3) Pergolas– The M.s pergola in semi-covered terrace, rooms and balconies help in a play of light and shadows.\n4) Jharokas– Jharokas made of M.S section have a distinct colour and are finished with Vitrified Tiles on the floor to give a modern feel to the Courtyard.\n5) Balcony– M.S Balcony railings act as Chajjas to the windows and pours in sunlight directly in the rooms.']	['<urn:uuid:ee48a09a-2186-42bd-8772-6f1191249c42>', '<urn:uuid:857601a1-cc0b-4366-ada6-c45ed75d907b>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	23	87	2196
97	evidence innate language chimpanzee communication	Studies with Nim Chimpsky showed that chimpanzees lack true language abilities according to Hockett's design features. While Nim learned 125 signs and created grammatical sentences, his communication lacked true productivity and displacement. His signing was mostly imitative (90% call-and-response, 50% direct copying) and showed no discontinuous jumps in learning that characterize human language acquisition. His longest sentences lacked proper grammar, suggesting operant conditioning rather than innate linguistic capability.	['By Jesse Shanahan\nDespite Earth being replete with biological and cognitive diversity, human language remains an entirely singular communicative system; no other living creature has an analogous method of self-expression. The unparalleled power of language to represent thought is the foundation for interpersonal relationships, culture, and is an inextricable component of all societies. The emergence of language is one of the most remarkable evolutionary events in the history of our planet and yet, although it is a universal part of human life and even intrinsic to human identity, its origin and exact nature remain a mystery.\nThe problem is that language is necessarily complex and weaves together human cognition, neurology, biology, behaviour, and psychology in a way that inhibits comprehensive or collaborative studies. For every aspect of human life that language enables, another theory of its origin and evolution exists as well. In a sense, the way language is studied depends entirely on the perspective of the person analysing it. A biologist, for example, will characterise language differently than a psychologist and will use different terminology to do so. Although seemingly contradictory, each of these views holds a piece of the puzzling origin of language: a question that remains one of the deepest unanswered mysteries concerning what it truly means to be human.\nMuch like astronomers, evolutionary linguists cannot directly interact with their object of study and must extrapolate backwards using data gathered from present day languages. This is possible because languages follow evolutionary patterns in terms of how sounds develop or words change. However, if the goal is to study the origin of language as a whole, then what was the first language? Even more so, how can we identify the first language if we cannot first define what a language even is? Surprisingly, constructing an exhaustive definition has proven to be an immensely difficult task that is further complicated by language’s numerous features, each of which interacts differently with human cognition, has different genetic roots, and likely has a different evolutionary path. Given just how interdisciplinary language is, settling on an accepted definition is further impeded by the contradicting terminology, distinct methodology, and differing norms in those various scientific disciplines.\nBroadly speaking, linguists divide language into the following six categories: phonetics, morphology, phonology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Phonetics and phonology are concerned with the speech sounds or signs of a language and how discrete units of sound (phonemes) are organised into meaningful words. Morphology studies the formation of words from meaningful units (morphemes), and syntax refers to how sentences are constructed from those words. More abstractly, semantics analyses the nature of meaning while pragmatics observes the relationship between context and meaning.\nThese divisions are solely linguistic, however. Other branches of science divide the study of language differently. For example, a more biological approach might distinguish between the genetic foundation of language, the anatomy of the human vocal tract, and the neurological features of the brain that allow for the production of speech and interpretation of meaning. Still, the linguistic model enables us to subdivide language into parts like sentences, words, morphemes, and phonemes, and then compare how those parts appear in different languages. Ideally, the characteristics that are common to all languages would then form a definition of language. A version of this approach was popularised by Noam Chomsky, an American linguist and philosopher, who argued that there are universal elements to all languages and that human beings will always develop languages with those elements.\nIn Chomsky’s theory, ‘Universal Grammar,’ these ubiquitous traits of language are hardwired into human beings via genetics, explaining why language is a uniquely human attribute. Although this is an attractive idea, the theory remains an ongoing source of disagreement among linguists. The sheer degree of linguistic diversity appears to undermine Chomsky’s claim that all human brains have the same set of structural rules for language, and languages have been discovered that seemingly lack those structure rules. More broadly, some scientists have argued that, because Universal Grammar is defined based the observed features of human language, it cannot be proven wrong. Instead, they argue that a truly scientific theory should make predictions, which can then be supported or refuted with evidence. Furthermore, some evolutionary biologists have also objected to Chomsky’s theory because, despite the claims of a genetic origin to human language, it conflicts with modern principles of Darwinian evolution. For example, how could language require a universal biological foundation when it evolves at significantly faster speeds? Simply put, how could a genetically coded grammar ever keep pace with a constantly evolving language?\nEven if Chomsky’s theory has been heavily criticised and largely discredited, it is the perfect example of a common linguistic strategy in defining language. By comparing diverse human languages, it is not only possible to identify the so-called ‘linguistic universals’ that define language but also to deduce probable features of the very first proto-language. Another similar approach to defining language is to compare human languages with the numerous methods of communication in the animal world. Complexity is hardly an attribute reserved solely for human language, and many species have robust, detailed systems for transmitting meaning. However, linguists reserve the term ‘language’ only for systems that give users both an unlimited array of meaningful, arbitrary expressions and the ability to innovate brand new ones. As far as we know, no animal method of communication has these features. An easy example of this distinction can be illustrated with what has been ironically named ‘body language’. Whether a person crosses their arms or gesticulates wildly is certainly meaningful, but it hardly constitutes a language. Similar analogies can be used with facial expressions, training commands taught to dogs, and musical humming. In contrast, gestural or signed languages provide the user with an infinite variety of phrases and the ability to craft new terms as the language evolves. Whereas both body language and gestural languages have meaning of one type or other, only the signed languages have the complexity, scope, and creativity required of a full language.\nAmerican linguistic anthropologist Charles Hockett described this distinction in terms of a set of attributes that he called ‘design features’. Like Chomsky, he attempted to define a list of the universal characteristics of all human languages. Notable design features include semanticity, which is the fact that certain combinations of sounds are connected to specific meanings, and arbitrariness, or the lack of connection between a word and its meaning. Hockett’s design features also list discreteness, or the ability of language to be broken into distinct parts, and displacement: the ability of human speakers to reference things that do not exist, e.g. the past or the future. Similarly, Hockett also required that language is productive; it enables speakers to create an unlimited number of new expressions. Although not every linguist agrees with Hockett’s requirements, his set of design features provides an excellent framework to understand the distinction between communication and language.\nFor example, ornithologists have discovered that bird communication utilises both semanticity and arbitrariness. Bird calls and songs also have discreteness, as they can be divided into individual units of meaning which can then be arranged using a kind of syntax. Dialect variations, mimicry, and even limited acquisition of human language has been observed, though debate still remains over whether the birds truly learned some human language or are simply emulating human behaviour. Still, the communication systems of birds fail Hockett’s productivity requirement, as they have a limited list of musical expressions and cannot innovate new ones. Birds also cannot reference nonexistent things (displacement), and they cannot utilize their calls to reference abstract concepts. Similarly, there are numerous other animal systems of communication, like those of bees or chimpanzees, that seem to parallel human language but invariably lack some critical trait when analysed using Hockett’s design features. Even if other linguists dispute some of Hockett’s framework, it aptly illustrates the complexity, breadth, and uniqueness of human language in addition to the difficulty of defining it.\nWhile comparative analyses or guidelines like Hockett’s design features bring us closer to an understanding of what language is, numerous ontological questions remain. We cannot even say whether language initially developed in songs, gestures, or speech, or when exactly proto-humans began to utilise complex systems of communication. A groundbreaking study published in 2017 discovered that the first anatomical evidence for increased vocal capability occurred roughly 4.5 million years ago. By comparing the skulls of various chimpanzees and those of A. ramidus, an extinct bipedal hominin from the early Pliocene epoch, researchers identified the emergence of anatomical features associated with vocal ability. Not only does this potentially suggest that language could have developed significantly earlier than previously thought, but this change in anatomy has also been correlated with decreased aggression in the species, which would further enable social interaction and the development of communication.\nSimilarly, a study at Yale University in June 2018 revealed a relationship between the number of phonemes in a given language and the expression of a gene associated with dyslexia. Another study conducted in 2012 discovered that humans developed a specific biological adaptation that enables us to keep up with the quick pace of language evolution, and for humans that evolved in one geographical region to quickly and adeptly learn languages that developed in another. Additionally, social groups, familial relationships, the increased use of tools, and the desire for self-expression have also all been suggested as potential origins of language.\nInterestingly, Hockett’s design features apply to this problem as well. By looking at the uses language has, we can identify even more possible motivations for its emergence. For example, the productivity of language suggests human beings developed a creative impulse in addition to a desire for self-expression. Likewise, the abstraction feature of language has a connection with our ‘theory of mind’: the ability to conceptualise our own thoughts, beliefs, intents, desires, etc., and ascribe similar ones to other people. Whether language caused those characteristics to develop in human beings or whether our own needs drove its design is still a matter of contentious debate. Thus, we often cannot even distinguish between a cause of language development or an effect of its evolution in our species.\nStill, these setbacks are understandable. Modern language is incredibly multifaceted; in the same way that language is entwined with our anatomy, cognition, psychology, and society, the first languages likely emerged due to a complex combination of influences as well. The strength of the relationship between language and the human experience makes disentangling its effects, causes, evolution, and origin even more difficult. When, if ever, we are finally able to understand the birth and evolution of language, we will have found an answer to one of the hardest unsolved problems in science.\nAnd yet, this explanation has an unsettling implication. Given that no other species on Earth has developed a system with the complexity, scope, and capability of human communication, achieving all of the requirements for language might be an incredibly rare event. Just as the uniqueness of biological life on Earth drives us to wonder if we are isolated in the universe, the singular existence of language in human beings raises the question: even if we aren’t alone, will we ever find another species who can truly understand us?', 'What does the language experiment with Nim Chimpsky prove about Chomsky’s claim that language is exclusively a human attribute?\nIn 1986 Noam Chomsky presented a theory about language acquisition and capabilities for this within the human race. He claimed that children do not learn language and are instead born with ‘Universal Grammar’, which in turn causes them to have an ability to pick up any language (dubbed ‘language instinct’ by Steven Pinker, 1994). In order for this to be proven correct, one of the key determining features of language acquisition is discontinuous jumps in the child/primate’s progress. This essay will evaluate these three factors off which Chomsky’s theory is based and compare the generic human example to the experiment done on the chimpanzee Neam ‘Nim’ Chimpsky (Herbert Terrace, Thomas Bever, Laura-Ann Petitto, 1973-2000) who was raised in a human family environment from just after birth and treated as a human child (Pinker, 1994). This will be in attempt to prove that Chomsky’s claim, while may not necessarily wholly correct, does have some scientific grounding and may be proven correct in the future when further research is performed.\nThe ‘Universal Grammar’ that Chomsky claims humans have is a rudimentary grammar knowledge which is built into our DNA from birth. He defines it as ‘the system of categories, mechanisms and constraints shared by all human languages and considered to be innate’ (Chomsky, 1986). This system predicts that there will be nouns and has an inbuilt strategy for modifying them. The brain is constantly on the lookout for this article system from the minute the child enters the world. However, this rests solely on the premise that all languages around the globe share certain structural properties, otherwise the grammar would have to differentiate based upon the location in which you are born. It has since been proven there are many similarities within languages, experts citing approximately four hundred functional categories (Heine and Kuteva, 2002) although views on this vary widely. Chomsky also suggests that the process by which sentences are perceived as correct or incorrect is universal and independent of meaning regardless of the language they are spoken in (Dubuc, 2010). This theory is based on the existence of formal universals (i.e. the rules which enable sentences, phrases and syllables to be understood) and substantive universals (i.e. grammatical categories and functions) (Tomasello, 2013) and their importance to creating and sustaining conversations. From the study of Nim it cannot be said that he understood grammar or even had the capability to, thus proving (at least in the case of this chimpanzee) that Chomsky’s theory has some qualitative basis. Throughout the course of the study, Nim created over twenty thousand potentially grammatical sentences (e.g. more + object and verb + noun not vice versa); however the phrase banana + me was performed three times more than me + banana. Some of the researchers thought that this could be an example of a foundation for grammatical knowledge, however as the American Sign Language (ASL) Nim was taught did not differentiate between the signs for ‘me’ and ‘my’ it is impossible to tell whether he understood grammar (insomuch as he was attempting to say ‘give the banana to me’ or whether he meant ‘my banana’, in which case he was in error the majority of the time) (Wynne, 2007). In addition, whilst Nim learnt approximately one hundred and twenty-five signs and could string them together into sentences, the longer ones often had no grammar, as in the example of his longest sentence ‘give orange me give eat orange me eat orange give me eat orange give me you’. This shows that there is no real innate understanding of grammar as the normal phrase order is verb + noun and whilst this is true for the first three words, from then it immediately stops making sense ‘give eat’ (verb + verb), clearly incorrect grammar. In addition, the phrases signed often included ‘hug’, ‘me’ and ‘Nim’ which fit with almost every other sign he knew and he was often rewarded for using. This then shows more of an operant conditioning style of learning than an inbuilt knowledge of grammar (Tomasello, 2013). Nim could effectively string any two words together and be rewarded for this which would cause him to remember it as a stimulus for reward the next time. As a result of this, Chomsky’s claim may appear to have some scientific basis for further research.\nThe concept of ‘language instinct’, whist named thusly by Pinker, is actually a large proportion of Chomsky’s theory. It states that in the presence of Universal Grammar, it is easy to pick up any language in the world, due to the structural similarities between them combined with the inbuilt grammar knowledge it is thought all humans are born with. In order for this to be truly called an ‘instinct’ however, there must be little explicit instruction in how to craft sentences; in other words there must be some natural knowledge and input from the child rather than learning simply through observation and direct imitation. Darwin called language ‘an instinct tendency to acquire an art’ (Pinker, 1994) which suggests that this idea predates both Chomsky and Pinker and as such, must have some scientific grounding. When we look at the study of Nim Chimpsky, Chomsky’s theory becomes even more substantiated. He was rarely found to be the one to initiate conversations, instead only signing in response to a question or phrase from one of his teachers (90% of his signing was through this call-and-response method) and often simply imitated the signs they were making. It was recorded that at least 50% of Nim’s signing was just copying the signs made to him (Premack, 1971). It was noted that he also often grabbed objects before signing for them, which could be taken simply to be a lack of manners as it is so often portrayed within younger children; but it is more likely to show that Nim did not ever rely upon ASL as a primary form of communication and simply reverted to using it when there was a necessity or he was likely to be rewarded for doing so. This again links back into the idea not of Nim understanding or having an innate knowledge of language and grammar, but simply his use of language being the result of a long trial of operant conditioning. This is backed up by Terrace’s statement, “much of the apes’ behaviour is pure drill” (Wynne, 2007) which seems to show that there is no real language instinct acting here.\nThe final marker to show that language is an exclusively human attribute is that of the discontinuous jumps in the process of learning or gaining language. Chomsky’s theory suggests that due to the combination of Universal Grammar and a ‘language instinct’, when a phrase such as the + noun is heard, it should mean that the specific grammatical rule for that noun class (i.e. common nouns, proper nouns, pronouns, etc.) is immediately grasped and from that point onwards, can be freely applied to that entire class (Evans, 2014). This then leads to the discontinuous jumps in language knowledge, as every time a new rule is learnt there should be a large spike and advance in language usage. Chomsky describes language as a mutation which produces a phenotype well outside the range of variation previously existing in the population (Evans, 2014), and as such these easily discernible jumps in language acquisition becomes known as a macromutation. However, when we consider Nim’s case this does not seem to appear. Nim’s signs were often highly repetitive (Petitto and Seidenberg, 1979) and his sentences did not appear to increase in length as his vocabulary advanced, the average sentence length being approximately 1.25 signs (Hart, 2015). He also appeared to learn signs at a fairly steady rate, purportedly learning 125 signs in just two years (Adler, 2008), however Petitto estimated that Nim’s vocabulary was closer to 25 signs. This cannot be called language as this is a doubly articulated system (i.e. object + state combined syntactically to create a meaning) and as shown earlier in this essay it is questionable what the meanings of Nim’s sentences were (Wade, 1980). This proves another part of Chomsky’s theory to be correct as Nim’s language learning process did not contain any discontinuous jumps in his understanding and grasp of language.\nIn conclusion, it is safe to say that Chomsky’s claim is fairly valid. Whilst the study of Nim and his acquisition of language whilst being raised like a human clearly proves the theory correct, this cannot be said of all species or even of all higher primates. In this case though, it can be said that Nim did not have Universal Grammar due to the longer sentences being no more than a jumble of signs however this cannot be conclusively proven due to the lack of differentiation between the signs for ‘me’ and ‘my’. Neither did Nim have any sign of a ‘language instinct’ as he seemed to sign sentences and phrases that he had learnt gained rewards, showing this set of experiments to be flawed as they had become more of an operant conditioning experiment and as such made the results invalid. Finally there were no discontinuous leaps in Nim’s sentence structure and length as he increased his vocabulary, thus proving that the elements laid out by Chomsky as markers of language knowledge were simply absent from the beginning, showing them to be innate to humans, or at the very least, absent from chimpanzees.\nAdler, M.

98	what factors associated with bruxism teeth grinding clenching habits	Factors associated with bruxism include disturbed sleep patterns, malocclusion of teeth, high consumption of caffeinated drinks and foods, high blood alcohol levels, anxiety, stress, work-related stress, irregular work shifts, drug use (such as SSRIs and stimulants), hypersensitivity of dopamine receptors, and disorders like Huntington's, Parkinson's, and OCD.	"['Bruxism is when you clench (tightly hold your top and bottom teeth together) or grind (slide your teeth back and forth over each other) your teeth.\nCauses, incidence, and risk factors\nPeople can clench and grind without being aware of it during both the day and night, although sleep-related bruxism is often the bigger problem because it is harder to control.\nThe cause of bruxism is not completely agreed upon, but daily stress may be the trigger in many people. Some people probably clench their teeth and never feel symptoms. Whether or not bruxism causes pain and other problems may be a complicated mix of factors:\n- How much stress you are under\n- How long and tightly you clench and grind\n- Whether your teeth are misaligned\n- Your posture\n- Your ability to relax\n- Your diet\n- Your sleeping habits\n- Each person is probably different.\nBruxism is a habit rather than a reflex chewing activity. Reflex activities happen reliably in response to a stimulus, without involvement of subconscious brain activity. Chewing and clenching are complex neuromuscular activities that can be controlled either by subconscious processes or by conscious processes within the brain. During sleep, (and for some during waking hours while conscious attention is distracted) subconscious processes can run unchecked, allowing bruxism to occur.\nSome bruxism activity is rhythmic with bite force pulses of tenths of a second (like chewing), and some has a longer bite force pulses of 1 to 30 seconds (clenching). Researchers classify bruxism as ""a habitual behavior, and a sleep disorder.""\nThe etiology of problematic bruxism can be quite varied, from allergic reactions or medical ailments, to trauma (such as a car crash) to a period of unusual stress, but once bruxism becomes a habit, the original stimulus can be removed without ending the habit. Certain medical conditions can trigger bruxism, including digestive ailments and anxiety.\nThe following factors are associated with bruxism:\nDisturbed sleep patterns and other sleep disorders (obstructive sleep apnea, hypopnea, snoring, moderate daytime sleepiness\nMalocclusion, in which the upper and lower teeth occlude in a disharmonic way, e.g., through premature contact of back teeth\nRelatively high levels of consumption of caffeinated drinks and foods, such as coffee, colas, and chocolate High levels of blood alcohol\nHigh levels of anxiety, stress, work-related stress, irregular work shifts, stressful profession and ineffective coping strategies.\nDrug use, such as SSRIs and stimulants including: methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), methylphenidate and other amphetamines, including those taken for medical reasons.\nHypersensitivity of the dopamine receptors in the brain.\nFrequent use of GHB and similar GABA-inducing analogues such as Phenibut\nDisorders such as Huntington\'s and Parkinson\'s diseases\nObsessive Compulsive Disorder\nSigns and tests\nAn examination can rule out other disorders that may cause similar jaw pain or ear pain, including:\nEar disorders such as ear infections\nProblems with the temporomandibular joint (TMJ)\nYou may have a history of significant stress and tension.\nEventually, bruxism with lateral movements shortens and blunts the teeth being ground and may lead to myofascial muscle pain, temporomandibular joint dysfunction and headaches. If enough enamel has been abraded, the softer dentin will be exposed, and abrasion will accelerate. This opens the possibility of dental decay and tooth fracture, and in some people, gum recession. Early intervention by a dentist is advisable. In severe, chronic cases, bruxism can lead to arthritis of the temporomandibular joints. The jaw clenching that is often part of bruxism can be an unconscious neuromuscular daytime activity. There is no recognized TMJ specialty in dentistry. See a dentist immediately if you are having trouble eating or opening your mouth. Keep in mind that a wide variety of possible conditions can cause TMJ symptoms, from arthritis to whiplash injuries. Therefore, see your dentist for a full evaluation if self-care measures do not help within several weeks.\nGrinding and clenching does not fall clearly into one medical disciplines. For a massage-based approach, look for a massage therapist trained in trigger point therapy, neuromuscular therapy, or clinical massage.\nDentists who have more experience in evaluating and treating TMJ disorders will typically take x-rays and prescribe a mouth guard. Surgery is now considered a last resort for TMJ.\nPatients may present with a variety of symptoms, including:\nAnxiety, stress, and tension\nSore or painful jaw\nClenching the teeth puts pressure on the muscles, tissues, and other structures around your jaw. The symptoms can cause temporomandibular joint problems (TMJ).\nGrinding can wear down your teeth. Grinding can be noisy enough at night to bother sleeping partners.\nMost people are not aware of their bruxism. Only an estimated 5% go on to develop symptoms, such as jaw pain and headaches, which prompt treatment. A sleeping partner or parent may notice the behavior first, although sufferers may notice pain symptoms without understanding the cause.\nBruxism can result in occlusal trauma, the abnormal wear patterns of the occlusal surface, abfractions and fractures in the teeth. Over time, dental damage increases. Bruxism is the leading cause of occlusal trauma and a significant cause of tooth lossand gum recession. Bruxism can be loud enough to wake a sleeping partner. Some individuals clench without significant lateral movements.\nIn a typical case involving lateral motion, the canines and incisors of the opposing arches are moved against each other laterally, i.e., with a side-to-side action, by the medial pterygoid muscles that lie medial to the temporomandibular joints bilaterally. This movement abrades tooth structure and can lead to the wearing down of the incisal edges of the teeth. People with bruxism may also grind their posterior teeth, which will wear down the cusps of the occlusal surface. Most (but not all) bruxism includes clenching force provided by masseter and temporalis muscle groups, but some bruxers clench and grind front teeth only, which involves neither masseter nor temporalis muscle groups. Teeth hollowed by previous decay (caries), or dental drilling, may collapse from bruxism\'s cyclic pressures.\nThe goals of treatment are to reduce pain, prevent permanent damage to the teeth, and reduce clenching as much as possible.\nTo help relieve pain, there are many self-care steps you can take at home. For example:\n- Apply ice or wet heat to sore jaw muscles. Either can have a beneficial effect.\n- Avoid eating hard foods like nuts, candies, steak.\n- Drink plenty of water every day.\n- Get plenty of sleep.\n- Learn physical therapy stretching exercises to help restore a normal balance to the action of the muscles and joints on each side of the head.\n- Massage the muscles of the neck, shoulders, and face. Search carefully for small, painful nodules called trigger points that can cause pain throughout the head and face.\n- Relax your face and jaw muscles throughout the day. The goal is to make facial relaxation a habit.\n- Try to reduce your daily stress and learn relaxation techniques.\nIf disagnosed early, finding and eliminating the original cause(s) may cure bruxism. Later on, habitual bruxism can be treated by habit-modification. Treating associated factors can reduce or eliminate the behavior in cases where bruxism has not become habitual.\nDental guards and splints\nA dental guard or splint can reduce tooth abrasion. Dental guards are typically made of plastic and fit over some or all of upper and/or lower teeth. The guard protects the teeth from abrasion and can reduce muscle strain by allowing the upper and lower jaw to move easily with respect to each other. Treatment goals include: constraining the bruxing pattern to avoid damage to the temporomandibular joints; stabilizing the occlusion by minimizing gradual changes to the positions of the teeth, preventing tooth damage and revealing the extent and patterns of bruxism through examination of the markings on the splint\'s surface. A dental guard is typically worn during every night\'s sleep on a long-term basis. Dental guards do not cure the condition.\nA repositioning splint is designed to change the patient\'s occlusion, or bite.\nTo prevent damage to the teeth, mouth guards or appliances (splints) have been used since the 1930s to treat teeth grinding, clenching, and TMJ disorders. A splint may help protect the teeth from the pressure of clenching.\nA splint may also help reduce clenching, but some people find that it makes their clenching worse. In others, the symptoms go away as long as they use the splint, but pain returns when they stop or the splint loses its effectiveness over time.\nThere are many different types of splints. Some fit over the top teeth, some on the bottom. They may be designed to keep your jaw in a more relaxed position or provide some other function. If one type does not work, another may.\nFor example, a splint called the NTI-tss fits over just the front teeth. The idea is to keep all of your back teeth (molars) completely separated, under the theory that most clenching is done on these back teeth. With the NTI, the only contact is between the splint and a bottom front tooth.\nAs a next phase after splint therapy, orthodontic adjustment of the bite pattern may help some people. Surgery is considered a last resort.\nFinally, there have been many approaches to try to help people unlearn their clenching behaviors. These are more successful for daytime clenching, since nighttime clenching cannot be consciously stopped.\nIn some people, just relaxing and modifying daytime behavior is enough to reduce nighttime bruxism. Methods to directly modify nighttime clenching have not been well studied. They include biofeedback devices, self-hypnosis, and other alternative therapies.\n""Bedside"" EMG units are similar to those used by sleep labs. These units pick up their signals from facial muscles through wires connecting the bedside unit to electrodes that are adhesively attached to the user\'s face. TENS electrodes or ECG electrodes may be used.\nA biofeedback headband may be used in silent mode to record the total number of clenching incidents and the total clenching time each night. These two numbers easily distinguish clenching from rhythmic grinding and allow dentists to quantify severity levels. Biofeedback headbands do not require adhesive electrodes or wires attached to the face. They do not record the exact time, duration, and strength of each clenching incident as bedside EMG monitors do.\nBedside EMG units and biofeedback headbands may be used either as a diagnosis measurement or in biofeedback mode as a treatment to help patients break their bruxism habit.\n""Disposable"" EMG monitors adhesively mount to the side of the face over the masseter muscle. They monitor one night and provide a single-digit measure of bruxism severity.\nThere is anecdotal evidence that suggests taking certain combinations of dietary supplements may alleviate bruxism; pantothenic acid, magnesium, and calcium are mentioned on dietary supplement websites. Calcium , a known treatment for gastric problems, and gastric problems such as acid reflux are known to increase bruxism.\nStress reduction and anxiety management may reduce bruxism in people prone to the condition.\nBotulinum toxin (Botox) can lessen bruxism\'s effects, though serious side-effects (including death) are possible. In extremely dilute form Botox is injected to weaken (partially paralyze) muscles and has been used extensively in cosmetic procedures to \'relax\' the muscles of the face. Facially injected Botox has been found to propagate into the brains of test animals, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a safety review of Botox and similar drugs. Less than one microgram of ingested or inhaled botulinum toxin is sufficient to kill an adult human.\nBotox was originally developed for use in treating strabismus (misalignment of eyes), during trials of which its effects on wrinkles in the eye area were discovered. It was, and continues to be, used to treat diseases of muscle spasticity such as strabismus, blepharospasm (eyelid spasm), andtorticollis (wry neck). Bruxism can also be regarded as a disorder of repetitive, unconscious contraction of the masseter muscle (the large muscle that moves the jaw). In the treatment of bruxism, Botox weakens the muscle enough to reduce the effects of grinding and clenching, but not so much as to prevent proper use of the muscle. Although the intent of Botox injections is for the Botox to go into the muscle and not into the rest of the body, it has been shown that some percentage of injected Botox winds up in the vascular system and migrates to other parts of the body. Botox treatment typically involves five or six injections into the masseter muscles. It takes a few minutes per side, and the patient starts feeling the effects the next day. Occasionally, bruising can occur, but this is quite rare. Injections must be repeated more than once per year, and the risk factor of spread of the botulinum toxin is compounded by this repetition.\nThe optimal dose of Botox must be determined for each person as some people have stronger muscles that need more Botox. This is done over a few touch-up visits with the physician. The effects last for about three months. The muscles do atrophy, however, so after a few rounds of treatment, it is usually possible either to decrease the dose or increase the interval between treatments.\nDamaged teeth can be repaired by replacing the worn natural crown of the tooth with prosthetic crowns. Materials used to make crowns vary; some are less prone to breaking than others and can last longer. Porcelain fused to metal crowns may be used in the anterior (front) of the mouth; in the posterior, full gold crowns are preferred. All-porcelain crowns are now becoming more and more common and work well for both anterior and posterior restorations. To protect the new crowns and dental implants, an occlusal guard should be fabricated to wear during sleep\nBruxism is not a dangerous disorder. However, it can cause permanent damage to the teeth and uncomfortable jaw pain, headaches, or ear pain.\n- Eating disorders\n- Increased dental or TMJ problems\nAuthorities caution that Botox should only be used for temporary relief for severe cases and should be followed by diagnosis and treatment, suggesting that prolonged use can lead to permanent damage to the jaw muscle.\nMedical Marijuana (cannabinoids) alleviate Bruxism\nBruxism is associated with anxiety, stress sensitivity, and depression, Low doses of cannabinoid agonists decrease motor activity, Cannabinoid antagonists increase motor behavior stimulated by DA agonists.\n“I take a few puffs about an hour before bedtime, and I regain the ability to control my jaw muscles. I tell them to relax and they do. My mind clears of the worries and stresses of the day and I am filled with the sense that everything is going to be okay. I fall asleep almost instantly and when I wake up, my jaw is relaxed and loose.” (Testimonial)\nMedical Marijuana can relieve most symptoms of bruxism without dangerous side effects!\nCannabinoids (CBD mainly + CBN)\n- muscle relaxants\n- sleep disorders\nBest Anti-Stress Strains: Purple Haze, Jack Frost, Jack the Ripper, Bubba Kush, Lambs Breath, Silver Tip, Sweet Cheese, Belladonna, Cali Gold, Grand Daddy Purple, Blackberry Kush, Black Domina, Auntie Em, Blueberry, Ultimate Indica, Lavender, Blue Dream, White Berry, Chemo, Cripple Creek, G13, Super Silver Haze.\n""Article on Bruxism"".

99	How do parents handle fever wrongly, and what challenges do digital archives face?	Regarding fever management, parents often make dangerous mistakes like immersing children in cold water, which causes blood vessels to constrict and can lead to higher fevers. Some apply alcohol or rub lemon on the skin, which can cause skin damage, while others incorrectly bundle up feverish children or simultaneously administer multiple forms of paracetamol. As for digital archives, they face unique preservation challenges including file format obsolescence, copyright issues, and license decay. Unlike physical archives, digital collections require careful consideration of data ownership, user rights, and ethical treatment of digital remains, especially concerning deceased individuals' information. Additionally, the sheer scale of digital archives (like Flickr's 50 billion images) creates complex preservation and curation challenges that require careful prioritization and deletion decisions.	"['Pediatrician Ha Dinh Bong, a member of the Group of Doctors guiding the treatment of baby F0 at home, said that in the process of instructing and counseling families of pediatric COVID-19 patients, the doctor encountered many cases. parents handle fever for children by word of mouth experience such as dipping children in cold water; let the baby soak in warm water; use alcohol or alcohol to apply to the armpit, groin area of the child; wipe the baby with lemon…\nThese are all wrong ways to reduce fever, which can lead to dangerous consequences for children’s health.\nImmerse the child’s body in cold water\nSome parents think that when the child has a high fever, if you dip your child’s whole body or soak your feet or hands in a basin of cold water, it will help reduce the heat and heal faster. There are even cases where the baby’s hands and feet are soaked in ice water.\nBong analyzed that when the baby was immersed in cold water, the baby’s skin was suddenly cold, causing the blood vessels under the skin to constrict, the blood flow concentrated in the center and limited flow through the capillaries under the skin. From there, the body cannot dissipate heat to the outside, which can cause the baby to have a higher fever. Soaking your baby in cold water for too long can also distort the body’s proteins, risking brain damage.\nLet your baby soak in warm water\nContrary to cold water, some parents let their baby soak in warm water to reduce fever.\nAccording to Dr. Bong, in some foreign hospitals like the US, doctors often have children soak in warm water to lower body temperature. However, these water pots must be temperature controlled, kept warm continuously, maintained at 2-3 degrees Celsius lower than the child’s body temperature (for example, a child with a fever of 39 degrees Celsius will be soaked in water). water maintained continuously at a temperature of 36-37 degrees Celsius).\nWhen mothers perform this method themselves at home for their children, it is very difficult to ensure that the water basin is always maintained at a standard temperature. We cannot control the temperature, the water will cool very quickly.\n“If the temperature is too low, it will cause heat disturbances inside the baby’s body as mentioned. And if the temperature is too high, for example, a child with a fever of 39 degrees Celsius is soaked in a basin of water of 39.5 degrees or 40 degrees, ie transferring more heat to the child, the child will have a higher fever. Soaking your baby in hot or cold water is not recommended.” Doctor Bong said.\nRub alcohol and wine on your child\nDuring the actual consultation, Dr. Bong saw that many mothers passed on the experience of rubbing alcohol or alcohol on their children’s armpits, groin, hands and feet to reduce fever. The doctor said, wiping the body with alcohol or alcohol can help cool down through the evaporation mechanism of alcohol. However, alcohol evaporates quickly and lowers the skin temperature quickly. As a result, the capillary system under the child’s skin will shrink, the body temperature will stay in the center (like immersing the child in cold water), eventually causing the child to have a higher fever.\nSome other parents shared their experience that applying lemon juice and vinegar all over the baby’s body will help cool down. “Regarding the mechanism to help reduce fever, this method has not been clearly proven, but the health consequences are visible. Lemon and vinegar are both acidic, and children’s skin is sensitive and immature. When applying lemon and vinegar to the baby’s skin, it is easy to cause skin damage and dermatitis. Bong said.\nWear a lot of clothes, wrap blankets, turn on the heater because you see that the child is cold\nSeeing that their children have malaria, parents often cover their children with many layers of blankets, dress them in warm clothes, and even turn on the heaters. According to Dr. Bong, the feeling of malaria is caused by a disorder in the body’s heat-regulating center. Your baby may feel cold, but the body is actually hot. Over-warming is similar to soaking your baby in hot water, which will cause the baby’s body temperature to continue to rise. The higher the temperature, the more dangerous the child’s health, the risk of convulsions.\nThe doctor gives advice, in case the child has a fever and feels cold to the touch, parents can warm the child’s head and head, not the whole body.\nTake oral paracetamol, put the anus at the same time\nDoctor Ha Dinh Bong informed that paracetamol is an active ingredient that has antipyretic effects. Currently, on the market, there are many products made from this active ingredient, but with different names and different finished products such as Hapacol (tablet form), Efferalgan (anal form), antipyretic drugs in syrup form. to drink,…\nWhen buying fever-reducing medicine, many mothers do not know that the ingredients of these drugs are all paracetamol, so they should give them to their children at the same time. “There are parents who see that their child has been taking fever-reducing tablets for 1 or 2 hours and then they don’t get better, so they continue to take another form of medicine, for example Efferalgan to put the anus. However, oral and anal use are both in the child’s body, and anal placement is equivalent to a single pill. The essence of these two drugs is the same active ingredient as paracetamol. emphasized the doctor.\nThe manufacturer and the Ministry of Health recommend that only repeat paracetamol after 4-6 hours, no more than 4 times a day. Thus, when using 2 antipyretic drugs too close will cause an increase in dose, overdose; risk of increased liver enzymes, hepatitis, poisoning.\nHow to properly treat a child’s fever?\nAccording to doctor Ha Dinh Bong, when a child has a mild fever, from 37.5 degrees Celsius to 38.5 degrees Celsius (or 38 degrees Celsius if the child has had a seizure), parents should take the following 4 steps.\n1, Place the child in a well-ventilated room.\n2, Loosen clothes, open diapers (even if the child feels cold, absolutely do not cover many blankets, do not wear many clothes, do not turn on the heater).\n3, Warm the child: Use a clean towel dipped in a basin of warm water from 32-35 degrees Celsius, squeeze out excess water and wipe the baby’s body; focus on wiping the neck, armpits, groin… Absolutely do not wipe with lemon juice, alcohol, alcohol. Do not immerse the child’s hands, feet or whole body directly into the basin of water.\n4, Preventing water-electrolyte disorders for babies: Children under 6 months need to increase the number of times of breast-feeding (or expressing milk, after every 15 minutes, children can eat a few spoonfuls); Older children can drink Oresol solution, take it a little bit and drink it many times.\nIn case the child has a high fever over 38.5 degrees Celsius (or over 38 degrees if ever having a seizure), it is necessary to use fever-reducing medicine immediately, combining 4 steps as above.\nAt the new guidance on home management for people with COVID-19 Issued on March 4, the Ministry of Health said that when a child with Covid-19 has a fever, parents can give the child a dose of paracetamol 10-15 mg/kg/time (oral or rectal), every evening. at least 4-6 hours if repeated. Note, the total dose should not exceed 60mg/kg/day.\nOr use dose according to age if the child’s weight is not known, specifically as follows: children under 1 year old take paracetamol 80mg, the oral dose is 1 pack x 4 times/day; Children from 1 to under 2 years old take paracetamol 150mg, dose 1 pack x 4 times/day; Children from 2 to under 5 years old take paracetamol 250mg, oral dose of 1 pack x 4 times/day; children from 5 to 12 years old take paracetamol 325mg, oral dose of 1 tablet x 4 times/day; Children over 12 years old take paracetamol 500mg, the dose is 1 tablet x 4 times/day.\nThe Ministry of Health emphasized, guiding the dose of paracetamol for children by age is only used when the weight of the child is unknown, the optimal dose is still calculated by weight.\nat Blogtuan.info – Source: vtc.vn – Read the original article here', ""Fattori's research focuses on the politics of blockchain in the arts & heritage sector.\nThe Flickr Foundation faces a unique task: overseeing an archive of 50 billion digital images (and counting) for the next 100 years. These images range from intimate family photographs to historic images captured by NASA scientists, they harbour the depiction and intellectual property of countless individuals. Whilst we can agree that the preservation of such an archive is a worthwhile endeavour in its own right, an archive of such scale prompts new considerations around the cultural, social, and environmental ethics of digital storage and display.\nThe Flickr Foundation partnered with the Oxford Internet Institute on 22nd May 2023 to convene a meeting of minds. The gathering brought together 18 scholars, researchers, artists, and archivists; stakeholders eager to address the new centennial challenge for digital preservation. The goal was to spark dialogue on priorities that might shape a future 100-year vision for the Flickr Foundation and similar digital archives. From this dialogue, three significant observations emerged:\nFlickr’s centennial challenge is unique to the age of Big Data. Long-term preservation strategies vary when the numbers of objects multiply exponentially. A 2019 New York Times study shows museum collections have ballooned in the last 50 years. Consequently, part of the modern archivist’s role is prioritisation and deletion. The seeming sacrilege of destruction is, in many ways, a reaction to the proliferation of items through technological and mechanical reproduction.\nLarge-scale digital archives present similar challenges to storage and a necessity for curation. As Nicole De Groot warns, “Being digital does not make it zero-weight or zero-waste.” If difficult decisions must be made, this introduces a new series of questions: which digital records can we let go of? Who should get to decide this? And how should this be done in a manner that honours their original contribution?\nIt might seem obvious, but it is worth stating, most conserved items are not digital. The Bodleian, for instance, over its 400-year lifespan, houses 1 million digital representations compared to 13 million physical items. As one workshop participant astutely observed, “ironically, digital has the least longevity”, due to a host of uniquely digital issues, including file format obsolescence, plagiarism, copyright, and license decay. Whilst this is a technical or infrastructural issue, there is also an emotional issue at play here.\nIt is challenging to replicate in the digital realm the same awe and reverence we experience when walking into a physical archive or beholding historic objects. We understand, academically, that digital archives are important, but perhaps to secure their longevity, we need to make steps to imbue them with emotional connections. Creative solutions might involve drawing from alternative methods of cataloguing, curating and display, such as the wunderkammer, Chinese Scholars Objects or the humble pegboard.\nLong-term planning for digital archives, such as Flickr’s, raises complex questions about data ownership and usability. The concept of informational dignity becomes central here, as digital archives will increasing include user-generated profiles and depictions of the deceased, which demand an enlivened approach to the ethical treatment of digital remains. As we move further into the age of Big Data, and as our understanding of the ‘digital human’ evolves, careful consideration must be given to ongoing access, rights to usage, deletion, and interpretation.\nThere are certainly positive possibilities for the usability of large-scale visual image analysis, as evidenced in the deployment of Flickr’s archive for researching climate change through analysis of flora and fauna in the background of photographs. But balancing scientific exploration and individual rights requires that dignity be at the centre of any long-term plan for user-generated archives. The consequences and correlations of future research projects are inherently unknowable, and therefore a right to be removed or ‘forgotten’ from the data should be built into any long-term plan. These rights could be extended to lineal descendants or communities, to ensure any future data deployment is reciprocal and not extractive.\nAs we contemplate the next 100 years, we must recognise that the fragments of our digital existence may outlive us, and their original contexts may well be lost. Digital preservation is not simply a technical problem to be solved by more storage or better file formats. In an era where much of human experience is recorded digitally, the conversation around preservation becomes essential to maintain historical continuity, understanding, and cultural flourishing. Moving towards an archive that is representative, usable, and responsible demands further discussion. As such, three core considerations for a future digital archive can be summarised as follows:""]"	['<urn:uuid:12a8c17c-d1c5-4641-94dc-b5212a0d81c3>', '<urn:uuid:fe02b538-c439-4616-8a83-dfd355c19ce0>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T13:30:49.468460	13	121	2156

['Category Archives: The Long Night\nThe Long Night – Ernst Israel Bornstein\nI am so very grateful to Noemie Lopian. Noemie is the daughter of Ernst Israel Bornstein and back in December she contacted me about her father’s book The Long Night. This is his first-hand account of what Ernst endured and witnessed in seven concentration camps. January 27th 2019 is Holocaust Memorial Day (Yom HaShoah) and a day we remember the six million of Jewish men, women and children who were murdered at the hands of the Nazis.\nErnst was just 17-years-old when the Nazis arrived at their Polish home in March 1941 and arrested him and in front of his fearful mother he was beaten and marched off to a labour camp. Glancing up at the window of their home was his mother. He was not sure when he would see her again. For Ernst this was the start of years of one concentration camp to another and the death marches were many were murdered while being marched from one camp to another.\nThe vision of seeing his tearful mother from the window of their home stayed with him. He was never to see his mother again. I read that from an extended family of 72 only six survived the Holocaust one was his sister.\nTo survive seven concentration and the murderous death marches was nothing short of a miracle for Ernst. Witnessing those close to him and the friends he made being killed would live with him forever. Ernst learnt how to survive in the concentration camps from one day to another it was a strategy that kept him alive. Keeping alive deep within him his love for his family. A burning desire deep inside to survive and see them again. But as time passed and stories of mass murder at other camps he was never sure were his family was or if they were still alive.\nGross-rosen Concentration Camp, Lower Silesia\nI have over the years read many books on the Holocaust and also survivors own stories. The Long Night deserves a place in history purely because of how Ernst Israel Bornstein describes in his own emotional words. It is the historical accounts from survivors of the Holocaust that are important as they tell the reader what it was actually like because they were there and witnessed the horror on a daily basis not knowing that as a new day dawned if they would ever see the sun go down that evening. These are their words.\nThe Long Night for Ernst lasted from the time the Nazis invaded Poland until he was liberated by the American Army. It was a Long Night that lasted over 5 years. Ernst Survived and lived to tell the world his story. It is hard to imagine how anyone could remember so much and in great detail. How he watched those around him being cut down or reduced to just nothing as they were given so little to eat yet treated brutally day and night.\nIt was survival of the fittest and they would fight for a scrap of food not knowing when they would get to eat again. Some reduced to eating blades of grass to try and survive.\nSurvive Ernst did and after the war he went to medical school and became a loving father. Survivors of the Concentration Camps have to then survive life after the camps and learn in their own way to survive. Many cannot speak of the time in the camps until many years later. It was in 1967 that Ernst published his account of life at the hands of the Nazis with ‘Die Lange Nacht’ in Germany.\nErnst Israel Bornstein died in 1978 of a heart condition. His daughter Noemie with the help of a translator published the English edition The Long Night (The Toby Press) in 2015 with a prefaced later by the then Prime Minister David Cameron.\nBoth Ernst’s parents and two sisters perished at Auschwitz.\nI will continue to share the stories of Holocaust survivors through my blog as I have always beleived it is important to keep their stories alive for future generations.\nThank you Noemie Lopian for a copy of your father’s book The Long Night.\nThe Long Night by Ernst Israel Bornstein was published on 21st January 2015 by Toby Press LLC and is available through to order through Waterstones, Amazon and through your local independent bookshop.', 'By Benjamin Stein\nTranslated by Brian Zumhagen\nOpen Letter Paper, 342 pages, $16.95\nIn 1995, a man named Binjamin Wilkomirski published a memoir called “Fragments,” in which he described the horrors of his childhood in Poland during the Holocaust. The book was a big deal. It was heaped with laurels, including the National Jewish Book Award, and was universally hailed as the Holocaust book we’d all hoped and feared we might see one day, the book that revealed (finally and definitively) the true depths of the Third Reich’s merciless and savage wrath toward even the smallest, the weakest among us. Maybe you remember it. If so, you also remember how Wilkomirski was exposed as a fraud.\nIt turned out that Wilkomirski had been ensconced in Switzerland throughout his childhood. He’d never set foot in Poland until long after the war was over. His name wasn’t Binjamin Wilkomirski, and he wasn’t even Jewish. This was way back when fake memoirs were still scandalous, and, what with the Holocaust content and the awards, you don’t need me to tell you what happened next.\nRead post on the Arty Semite blog about the Top 10 Jewish Literary Scandals\nThe ink of public outrage, not to mention indignation and handwringing — by people with and without a vested interest in the book, its subject and what it might possibly mean that the memory of the Holocaust could be abused for purely capitalistic ends — ran so thick that it blotted out the book itself. And why wouldn’t it? This was troubling stuff that cut right to the spleen of contemporary Jewish identity.\nA literary hoax almost identical to the Wilkomirski scandal is at the center of Benjamin Stein’s new novel, “The Canvas” (translated from the German by Brian Zumhagen), but he has no interest in passing judgment yet again on some goy who dared to co-opt our sacred pain. Instead, he wants to poke at and stir up all the troubling stuff the scandal briefly revealed. He understands that the scandal had less to do with the memory of the Holocaust than with the politics of contemporary Judaism, and he views the response to the scandal as a symptom of a larger divide in the Jewish self. This divide is embedded in the very structure of the book.\nAlthough the story revolves around a false memoirist whose details mirror almost exactly those of Wilkomirski — here he’s named Minsky — he is in no way the central character. That role is split between two people whose lives have been altered by Minsky: Jan Weschler, the journalist/novelist who uncovered the hoax, and Amnon Zichroni, the psychoanalyst who first encouraged Minsky to write his memories down on paper. The book is divided evenly between them, and to read each of their stories, one must flip the book over and over again because, as the jacket copy says, the “protagonists… recount their own version of the truth from opposite ends of this book, with their stories leading to the ultimate showdown right in the middle.”\nNot incidentally, both these men are Jews, and, as they each tell their stories, they evoke nearly incompatible visions of what being Jewish means.\nZichroni, whose story takes the form of a sentimental education, is a Haredi from the Mea Shearim neighborhood in Jerusalem who is shipped off to Switzerland at the age of 15, after the rabbi at his yeshiva discovers him reading Oscar Wilde instead of the Gemara he’d been assigned. Zichroni’s story is one of gradual movement out of an old world, with its strictures and rituals, to a new one full of possibilities for a balanced relationship between the spiritual and the secular.\nAs he travels from Israel to Europe to the United States and back again, he is taken in by a variety of mentors: his uncle Nathan, an orthodox bachelor and jeweler who becomes his guardian; his chavrusa (study) partner Eli, who introduces him to the esoteric teachings of the Musar and Kabbalistic traditions. Zichroni discovers that he has telepathic powers, which he eventually puts to use, absorbing the experiences of others in his capacity as a psychoanalyst with the hope of helping them heal their fractured selves. He meets Minsky. He listens to Minsky’s story. With his telepathic powers, he’s able to verify that the man’s horrific memories are true. The facts matter less than the power of the story.\nThe Weschler half of the book is an amnesia tale. His life is disrupted one Sabbath when an airline porter delivers a suitcase to his door in Munich, with an apology for having taken so long to track it down. Apparently, Weschler had reported it lost after a trip to Israel the year before, but he has no memory of having taken this trip and no memory of the suitcase. He believes himself to be a contented German citizen, born in East Berlin to Jewish parents, his life defined by his experiences in “the Small Country” under the Soviet regime and his lifelong passion for the great literature of the world. Despite the difficulty of doing so in Germany, he’s careful to follow the Orthodox Jewish traditions.\nBut there’s another Weschler, who might just be him, and this Weschler is Swiss and wholly secular in his Judaism, a successful novelist, celebrated for having exposed the hoax that is Minsky and his book. It’s this Weschler to whom the suitcase belongs. As Weschler explores this mystery, his sense of self begins to collapse until, finally, he has to admit that he’s as much of a fraud as he accused Minsky of being. The questions for him then become: How could he have forgotten himself, and why was he so obsessed with Minsky’s lies; and how does this relate to his Orthodox lifestyle? The answer lies in Israel, where the suitcase came from and where, he suspects, his deception originated.\nAs Weschler’s and Zichroni’s stories begin to collide, the two of them end up together, first bunkered in a West Bank settlement, then groping in the dark at the healing waters of Motza, both of their lives fractured by their relationships with Minsky, but for opposite reasons. Zichroni, the Israeli-born Haredi whose faith in Minsky’s Holocaust story is unwavering, has lost his right to practice anywhere but Israel. His initials are AZ, recalling the phrase “I am the Alpha and Omega” from the Book of Revelation. Weschler, a secular Jew masquerading as a devout one, exposes Minsky’s hoax and becomes a criminal in the land of his people. But his initials are JW, i.e. Jew. Despite, or because of his European sensibilities, his Jewishness is embedded in his personhood.\n“The Canvas” is a brave book. Instead of guarding the memory of victimhood that Jewish art so often presents to the world — that sentimental link between the Holocaust and Israel and Jewish identity — it asks, who are we now that we have power in the world? Do we even know ourselves? Are the stories we’ve told ourselves any truer than those others have thrust upon us? And isn’t it time for us to begin building a less divisive, less defensive, more nuanced and expansive identity for ourselves? Isn’t it time for Jews to admit that our lives and culture belong as much to the post-Holocaust Diaspora as to Israel? These are grave, essential questions and Benjamin Stein has written an important book, not just because it asks them but because it strives to find honest answers.\nJoshua Furst is a frequent contributor to the Forward.
