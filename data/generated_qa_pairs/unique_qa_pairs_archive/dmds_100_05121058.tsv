1	radon exposure measurement health effects	Radon exposure is measured in working level months (WLMs), with risk increasing at higher exposure levels. The health impacts are significant - radon causes 21,000 lung cancer deaths annually in the US, with smokers having 10 times higher risk of radon-induced lung cancer. Skin cancer risk occurs through radon daughters plating out on skin, with dose depending on radioactivity concentration and alpha particle penetration depth.	['The concentration of radon daughters suspended in air is measured in working levels (WL) or equilibrium equivalent concentration (EEC). Human exposure to radon daughters depends on the concentration at a specific location and the time that the person spends at that location; it is measured in working level months (WLMs). The risk increases as the exposure in WLM increases. Numerical estimates of risk have been reviewed extensively by the committee on health risks of exposure to radon (BEIR VI) (NRC, 1999) and International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP, 1981; 1991; 1993).\nThe risk of skin cancer in radon-rich atmospheres is not associated with inhalation or other intake of radioactivity. It is related to the plate out of radon daughters on the skin. The dose to sensitive cells in the skin depends on the concentration of radioactivity on the surface skin and the ability of alpha particles from 218Po and 214Po to penetrate to the location of the sensitive cells. Previous studies of that process have used a nominal value of 70 mm as the depth of the sensitive basal cells at the base of the epidermis. Recent measurements have indicated large variation in the depth of the basal cells, and this could lead to higher doses than previously expected (Eatough, 1997). We have assessed the pathway to determine whether the projected risk of skin cancer is comparable with the risk of lung cancer posed by the same exposure in WLM.\nThe dose delivered by an alpha particle as it passes through tissue depends on the stopping power, dE/dx. Values of that quantity have been complied by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and can be downloaded directly from its Web site (http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/contents-radi.html). Those data can be used to compute the dose as a function of depth for radioactivity uniformly deposited on the surface. Figure B.1 shows the results of the computation for 218Po (6 MeV alpha particle) and 214Po (7.7 MeV alpha particle). The data clearly illustrate that the alpha particle from 214Po will not reach basal cells at a depth of more than 50 µm.\nThe epidermis is not a flat organ located uniformly below the skin. There are undulations that are responsible for large variations in depth. Eatough has published distributions of epidermal thickness in various locations on the body (Eatough, 1997). We have simulated those data as a lognormal distribution (median = 50, σg = 1.5) to represent the epidermal thickness on the exposed face of a person in Figure B.2.\nThe next step is to determine the amount of radioactivity that will plate out on the skin for a given concentration of radon daughters suspended in the air. Denman et al. (2003) and Sevkova et al. (1978) have reported measurements of plate out on exposed skin. We have adopted a value of 2 (Bq/m2)/(Bq/m3) which is consistent with the reported results. Combining those results and assuming a steady-state condition with equal concentrations of 218Po and 214Po on the skin, we obtain a result of 200 mSv/WLM for the effective dose to the skin.', 'By Philip Jalbert, Environmental Protection Agency\nWould you live in a home that was not safe and secure? To be marketable, multifamily housing needs to be both. Moreover, to be safe and to feel secure, a home needs to be healthy. A healthy indoor environment is as attractive to tenants and homebuyers as is a safe and secure one.\nWe spend an average of 90 percent of our time indoors. Each year there are tens of thousands of deaths and millions of illnesses because of poor indoor air quality. Billions of dollars are spent every year on health care related to poor indoor air quality (IAQ), and the loss of school days and business productivity is enormous.\nSome of the most common and serious indoor air quality issues are caused by: too much moisture—leading to mold and mildew; poorly maintained or operated combustion appliances that emit carbon monoxide (CO), nitrous oxide (NO) and particulates; volatile and semi-volatile organic chemicals (VOCs, SVOCs) from building materials and finishings; radon gas seeping into the home from soil under the home; and secondhand smoke. (Readers can find IAQ information and free\nAcceptable indoor air quality (IAQ) and occupant health depend on many factors, such as: occupant behavior and practices (smoking, cleaning, cooking and home maintenance practices); proper building siting, design and construction; proper ventilation; and control of furnishings and other products and sources that emit hazardous pollutants indoors.\nIndoor Air Quality is a particular concern in multifamily buildings. While indoor air quality is a potential concern in all types of housing, in multifamily buildings pollutants can move from unit to unit, and into common areas through openings in walls and ceilings, and through shared ventilation systems. Isolating individual units—often called “compartmentalization”—is sometimes needed to address IAQ issues in multifamily buildings.\nHow can you prevent exposure to second-hand smoke?\nSmoking is an important occupant behavior not only for the person who smokes, but also for those who share the indoor space. In fact, when it comes to multifamily housing, depending on the degree of air sealing and design of a building’s heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, secondhand smoke can adversely affect non-smoking occupants in neighboring units. An estimated 3,000 Americans die each year from lung cancer due to exposure to secondhand smoke or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Secondhand smoke is also a significant asthma trigger and causes other important health problems, particularly in children.\nThe two main strategies for preventing exposure to secondhand smoke in multifamily buildings are to prohibit smoking in the building entirely, or seal individual units where smoke-free policies are not currently in place. About 10 percent of public housing is now smoke-free.\nThe Departments of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Health and Human Services (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently developed two smoke-free toolkits for multifamily housing. The toolkits are for residents, and public housing authorities and owners/management agents.\nHUD also issued two smoke-free notices: HUD Public and Indian Housing Smoke-Free Notice (PIH-2012-25, May 29, 2012); and, HUD Notice on Smoke-Free Housing (H 2012-22, October 26, 2012). On October 4, 20102, HUD also published a Request for Information on smoke-free in the Federal Register.\nIs radioactive radon soil gas an issue?\nEPA’s current risk assessment estimates that exposure to radon in U.S. homes is responsible for 21,000 or 13.4 percent of all lung cancer deaths each year. The risk is highest among smokers. When combined with exposure to radon, smokers’ risk of radon-induced lung cancer increases about ten times.\nMore and more builders of multifamily housing are including radon-reducing features in new homes. In its 2011 annual survey of builder practices, the National Association of Home Builder’s Home Innovation Research Labs estimated that of the 223,400 multifamily housing starts:\n• 19.4 percent included radon-reducing features, up from 15.3 percent in 2010; and\n• 29.5 percent included radon-reducing features in the highest radon potential areas (Zone 1), up from 18.9 percent in 2010.\nRadon source control measures such as active sub-slab soil depressurization (ASD) have other applications and potential benefits. A limited EPA funded study of Pennsylvania residences found that ASD systems can reduce indoor humidity and moisture levels during the non-summer months of the year. ASD systems are also used to manage soil gases and vapor intrusion. The American Association of Radon Scientists and Technologists (AARST) is consulting with EPA to develop a vapor intrusion mitigation credential as an add-on to the AARST-National Radon Proficiency program’s mitigation credential. www.aarst.org/\nWhat’s the federal government doing about radon?\nThe Federal Radon Action Plan is a continuing Federal initiative. One result of the Plan is HUD adopting an unprecedented radon policy for multifamily housing (see above). HUD and EPA are two of nine Federal agencies participating in the Federal Radon Action Plan. The Plan works to reduce the radon risk in housing and schools owned, managed or financed by the Federal Government. The expectation is that Federal leadership by example will spur more private sector action on radon risk reduction.\nAdditionally HUD announced two new notices regarding radon:\n• Office of Multifamily Development, Notice H 2013-03 (Jan. 31, 2013); and,\n• Office of Public and Indian Housing, Notice PIH 2013-06 HA (Feb. 4, 2013).\nThe Multifamily Notice supplements the environmental review process and requirements for the identification and mitigation of radon in new FHA-insured mortgage applications. The Public and Indian Housing notice encourages Public Housing Authorities to plan and complete radon testing and mitigation when appropriate.\nDo energy retrofits affect IAQ?\nMore than ever before American homes are being upgraded or remodeled. This trend is likely to increase in the future as efforts to improve building energy efficiency continue. The benefits of energy upgrades are tremendous—improved real property value, lower costs and sustained American jobs. However, energy upgrades can inadvertently worsen indoor air quality. This is true when there is not an appropriate assessment made before work begins or if work is done improperly.\nTo help guide upgrade activities, the Department of Energy (DOE) developed Guidelines for Home Energy Professionals. Working in concert with DOE, EPA\ndeveloped the Healthy Indoor Environment Protocols for Home Energy Upgrades—\nto complement the Guidelines. The Protocols apply to existing single-family and multifamily low-rise residential buildings.\nThe pollutants to be concerned about are: asbestos, VOCs, moisture, CO, ETS, ozone, NO, lead, PCBs, radon, combustion emissions, and below ground contaminants.\nThe Protocols provide detailed guidance on assessment, and minimum and expanded actions to remedy problems for each of the pollutants. The protocols provide practical guidance on improving or maintaining indoor air quality and indoor environments during home energy upgrades or remodeling.\nAnother valuable resource when rehabbing occupied buildings is the IAQ Guidelines for Occupied Buildings under Construction, 2nd Edition (ANSI/SMACNA 008–2008), produced by the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors’ National Association.\nCan climate change affect IAQ?\nA recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) study found that climate change is likely to make existing indoor air quality problems more widespread and severe. The IOM, part of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), evaluated the state of scientific understanding of the effects of climate change on indoor air quality and public health.\nPhilip Jalbert is executive secretary with the Federal Interagency Committee on Indoor Air Quality at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Indoor Environments Division.']	['<urn:uuid:678d4485-6bc2-469c-a92a-0840b0bbbd70>', '<urn:uuid:dddb494d-276e-473c-ab00-56382a7039df>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	5	65	1717
2	passive vs active student learning difference	In passive learning strategies like lectures, the student's mind is treated like a sponge that absorbs information. In contrast, active learning strategies engage the student's brain like interlocking gears, where it actively turns and churns while testing hypotheses and creating knowledge.	"[""My students are beginning research posters this week, so the course is returning to information on effective design and in particular the design principles of Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity. In today’s post, I’ll share the active learning tasks I’m using to ask students to recall prior knowledge and give them hands-on work with the design principles.\nActive learning tasks ask students to engage directly in their learning process by “involving [them] in doing things and thinking about the things they are doing” (Bonwell & Eison 1991).\nA simplified explanation of this teaching strategy compares students' minds to sponges and to mechanical gears. Passive learning strategies, such as lectures, treat the student’s mind like a sponge, ready to absorb ideas as it creates a repository of information. It aligns well with Paulo Freire’s banking model of education. Active learning strategies, alternately, engage the student’s brain as if it were a machine made of interlocking gears, turning and churning as it tests hypotheses and creates knowledge.\nThe series of tasks I describe below asks students to recall what they know about the design principles, to apply the principles through several analysis activities, and to forecast how they will use the principles in their research posters.\nBackground Readings and Resources\n- Chapter 11, “Designing Print and Online Documents,” from Markel & Selber’s Technical Communication [the course textbook]\n- “Visual design principles,” from O’Reilly\n- “Principles of Design Quick Reference Poster,” from Paper Leaf Design\nBasic Activity Logistics\nThe course includes weekly writing and revision activities that students complete individually and in groups. Discussion prompts and related activities are posted as weekly activities. Since I teach a fully-online course, this work is submitted as a discussion post to me in the course management software. These tasks are much like the in-class activities that would be part of a face-to-face course.\nThe tasks below give you the short version of the prompt. I add more specific details on how to post, share, and reply to one another in the assignments shared with students.\nActive Learning Tasks\nDesign Principles Scavenger Hunt\nGo on a hunt on campus or online for a good or bad visual. It can be any kind of visual—a digital sign, a full-page ad in a magazine, a billboard, and so forth. It doesn’t have to be a research poster. Here’s one way to find a visual for this discussion: Find a bulletin board on campus. Stand across the hall from it, and identify the one piece on the bulletin board that grabs your attention.\nTake a photo of the visual you find or save the visual if you found it online. Add a paragraph that tells us why it is a good visual or a bad one. Use the ideas from the textbook to support your ideas.\nDesign Principles Prescription\nYou are the Design Doctor. Choose a visual from the Design Principles Scavenger Hunt or one that you have found elsewhere, and consider how well the visual uses the design principles of contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. Respond in three parts:\n- Describe how the visual uses the design principles.\n- Diagnose the design shortcomings of the visual.\n- Prescribe solutions that will improve the visual.\nPositive Application Task\nChoose a visual from a previous project in the course or one that you are planning to use in your research poster. Annotate the visual with details on how you have used the design principles of contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. Label features of the visual with arrows that pair with related descriptions and explanations of the design principles. Use Figure 11.1 on pages 251–52 of Technical Communication as the model for your response.\nResearch Poster Design Plan\nBased on what you know about the design principles of contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity, create a design plan for your research poster.\n- Brainstorm a list of ideas you want to emphasize in your poster.\n- Apply design principles to the ideas, indicating strategies you can use to highlight the content on your poster.\n- Create a style sheet for your poster, outlining the design decisions you have made. For instance, your style sheet should cover information such as the following:\n- What font and font size will you use for regular text?\n- What font and font size will you use for Level 1 headings? Level 2 headings?\n- What colors will you use on the poster, and where will you use them?\nThese four active learning activities seem relatively simple on the surface; however, they build on one another to lead students to recall how the design principles work and then apply those principles to their own work. What strategies do you use to encourage students to apply composing and design strategies to their own work? Please tell me by leaving a comment below.\nBonwell, C. C., & Eison, J. A. (1991).

3	How did Ursula Le Guin influence JK Rowling's Harry Potter books?	The Harry Potter books share several elements with Le Guin's Earthsea series, including a school of magic, a trainee sorcerer scarred and pursued by a shadow power joined to him alone, an elderly mage and a teenage boy on a quest to defeat a death-conquering dark wizard.	"[""Ursula Le Guin\n7 Bestselling authors share their love and respect for the influential writer.\nFirst published in the 1960s, Ursula Le Guin has nourished the sci-fi and fantasy genre with piercing visions of race, gender, ecology and politics. She’s also been its hero defender.\nHere seven bestselling writers reflect on the huge impact she made on their work...\n1. Margaret Atwood\nMargaret Atwood describes Ursula Le Guin as 'one of the classic twentieth-century writers', praising her talent as a stylist as well as her ability to coalesce new ways of thinking about the world into good literature.\nWhile both writers share overlapping environmentalist and feminist themes, particularly in Le Guin’s Hainish cycle (1974—2000) and Atwood’s MaddAddam trilogy, they’re not always in accord.\nAtwood’s preference for the term 'speculative' over 'science' fiction to describe her work proved one point of contention. It’s apt that Le Guin, whose concept of magic in the Earthsea series springs from the true naming of things, places importance on the labels writers use.\n2. David Mitchell\nUrsula Le Guin has been cogently arguing away the supposed difference between good genre fiction and good literary fiction for decades, so it must be heartening for her to see twice Booker Prize shortlisted novelist David Mitchell carry the same banner aloft. Mitchell regularly cites Le Guin and Tolkien as major influences on his celebrated era and continent-leaping work, from Cloud Atlas and The Bone Clocks to forthcoming novel, Slade House.\n3. Zadie Smith\nZadie Smith’s relationship with Ursula Le Guin’s work is a recent but fruitful one.\nIn 2011, under the tutelage of 'a friend who reads a lot of science fiction', the acclaimed novelist, short story writer and essayist was introduced to Le Guin’s 1974 anarchist utopia, The Dispossessed. 'I felt like a child reading it' wrote Smith, 'by which I mean I was totally subsumed in it'.\nThat subsumption has found its way into Smith’s forthcoming fifth novel, which she describes as a 'science-fiction romp' influenced by Le Guin’s work and the feminist movements of the 60s and 70s.\n4. JK Rowling\nThe Harry Potter books (1997—2007) are confettied with elements found in Ursula Le Guin’s Earthsea series (1968—2001). A school of magic, a trainee sorcerer scarred and pursued by a shadow power joined to him alone, an elderly mage and a teenage boy on a quest to defeat a death-conquering dark wizard…\n5. George RR Martin\nUrsula Le Guin numbers among a list of respected fantasists without whom, according to George R.R. Martin, 'A Song Of Ice And Fire could never have been written'. Martin’s series (1996—)blends his imagination with myth, epic poetry, English royal history and the expansive world building of twentieth-century writers including Tolkien, Vance and Le Guin.\nLe Guin’s influence on Martin is traceable in specific and broad terms. Specific in that both writers’ signature fantasy sagas include cruelly abused girls who manifest affinities with dragons after being burnt by fire, and broad in that Le Guin’s work forms part of the abundant seam into which Martin’s writing taps.\n6. Terry Pratchett\nHomage isn’t the only outcome of influence; parody is its twin.\nWriting in 1990, the late, great Terry Pratchett named Ursula Le Guin as one of the architects of 'the consensus fantasy universe', a world of 'dragons, and magic users, and far horizons, and quests, and items of power, and weird cities'. Pratchett saw problems in that universe, not least its unbalanced portrayal of magisterial male, and cheap female, magic. Enter Granny Weatherwax and a whole Discworld to right that wrong and fondly prod fantasy out of its humourlessness.\n7. Neil Gaiman\nNeil Gaiman credits Ursula Le Guin not only for having an umbilical influence on the fantasy genre in which he has made his home, but also for altering his political consciousness.\nThe Left Hand Of Darkness, Le Guin’s award-winning tale about an androgynous alien race, altered Gaiman’s entire conception of gender as a pre-teen. 'The idea that a king could give birth?' he recalls, 'it changed my head'.\nLe Guin’s essays on the writing process and defence of sci-fi and fantasy against shabby prejudicial attitudes also inspired Gaiman. Her writing informed his feminism, storytelling, and by his admission, the person he is.\nPlus a few more!\nOther writers influenced by Ursula Le Guin, see: China Miéville, Octavia Butler, Salman Rushdie, Robin Hobb, Kelly Link, Michael Chabon, Jonathan Lethem and Iain Banks.""]"	['<urn:uuid:e648d208-7aaf-47ea-a6eb-543b892e8101>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	11	47	733
4	what happens to flux density distribution under poles when current flows in armature circuit	When current flows in the armature circuit, the flux produced by the armature mmf opposes flux in the pole under one half of the pole and aids under the other half of the pole. As a result, flux density increases in one half of the pole and decreases under the other half of the pole. If the increased flux density causes magnetic saturation, the net effect is a reduction of flux per pole.	['The separately excited dc generator, the field winding is connected to a separate source of dc power. This source may be another dc generator, a controlled rectifier, or a diode rectifier, or a battery. The steady-state model of the separately excited dc generator is shown in Fig. 1. In this model\nRfw is the resistance of the field winding.\nRfc is the resistance of the control rheostat used in the field circuit.\nRf = Rfw + Rfc is the total field circuit resistance.\nRa is the resistance of the armature circuit, including the effects of the brushes. Sometimes Ra is shown as the resistance of the armature winding alone; the brush-contact voltage drop is considered separately and is usually assumed to be about 2 V.\nRL is the resistance of the load.\nIn the steady-state model, the inductances of the field winding and armature winding are not considered.\nThe defining equations are the following:\nVf = Rf If …(1)\nEa = Vt + Ia Ra …(2)\nEa = Ka F wm …(3)\nVt = It RL …(4)\nIa = It …(5)\nEquation 2 defines the terminal or external characteristic of the separately excited dc generator; the characteristic is shown in Fig.2. As the terminal (i.e., load) current It increases, the terminal voltage Vt decreases linearly (assuming Ea remains constant) because of the voltage drop across Ra. This voltage drop Ia Ra is small, because the resistance of the armature circuit Ra is small. A separately excited dc generator maintains an essentially constant terminal voltage.\nAt high values of the armature current, a further voltage drop (D VAR) occurs in the terminal voltage; that is known as armature reaction (or the demagnetization effect) and causes a divergence from the linear relationship. This effect can be neglected for armature currents below the rated current. It will be discussed in the next section.\nThe load characteristic, defined by Eq. 4, is also shown in Fig. 2. The point of intersection between the generator external characteristic and the load characteristic determines the operating point, that is, the operating values of the terminal voltage Vt and the terminal current It.\nFig. 1: Steady state model of a separately excited dc generator.\nFig. 2: Terminal characteristics of a separately excited dc generator.\nArmature Reaction (AR)\nWith no current flowing in the armature, the flux in the machine is established by the mmf produced by the field current, as shown in Fig-3a. However, if the current flows in the armature circuit, it produces its own mmf (hence flux) acting along the q-axis. Therefore, the original flux distribution in the machine due to the field current is disturbed. The flux produced by the armature mmf opposes flux in the pole under one half of the pole and aids under the other half of the pole, as shown in Fig. 3b. Consequently, flux density under the pole increases in one half of the pole and decreases under the other half of the pole. If the increased flux density causes magnetic saturation, the net effect is a reduction of flux per pole. This is illustrated in Fig. 3c.\nFig. 3: Armature reaction effects.\nTo have a better appreciation of the mmf and flux density distribution in a dc machine, consider the developed diagram of Fig.4a. The armature mmf has a saw tooth wave form as shown in Fig. 4b. For the path shown by the dashed line, the net mmf produced by the armature current is zero because it encloses equal numbers of dot and cross currents. The armature mmf distribution is obtained by moving this dashed path and considering the dot and cross currents enclosed by the path. The flux density distribution produced by the armature mmf is also shown in Fig. 4b by a solid curve. Note that in the interpolar region (i.e., near the q-axis), this curve shows a dip. This is due to the large magnetic reluctance in this region. In Fig.4c the flux density distributions caused by the field mmf, the armature mmf, and their resultant mmf are shown. Note that\n· Near one tip of a pole, the net flux density shows saturation effects (dashed portion).\n· The zero flux density region moves from the q-axis when armature current flows.\n· If saturation occurs, the flux per pole decreases. This demagnetizing effect of armature current increases as the armature current increases.\nAt no load (Ia = It = 0) the terminal voltage is the same as the generated voltage (Vt0 = Ea0). As the load current flows, if the flux decreases because of armature reaction, the generated voltage will decrease (Eq. 3). The terminal voltage will further decrease because of the Ia Ra drop .\nIn Fig.5, the generated voltage for an actual field current If(actual) is Ea0. When the load current Ia flows the generated voltage is Ea = Vt + Ia Ra. If Ea < Ea0, the flux has decreased (assuming the speed remains unchanged) because of armature reaction, although the actual field current If(actual) in the field winding remains unchanged. In Fig. 5, the generated voltage Ea is produced by an effective field current If(eff). The net effect of armature reaction can therefore be considered as a reduction in the field current. The difference between the actual field current and effective field current can be considered as armature reaction in equivalent field current. Hence,\nIf(eff) = If(actual) – If(AR) …(6)\nwhere If(AR) is the armature reaction in equivalent field current\nFig. 4: MMF and flux density distribution.\nFig.5: Effect of armature reaction.\nThe armature mmf distorts the flux density distribution and also produces the demagnetizing effect known as armature reaction. The zero flux density region shifts from the q-axis because of armature mmf (Fig.4), and this causes poor commutation leading to sparking. Much of the rotor mmf can be neutralized by using a compensation winding, which is fitted in slots cut on the main pole faces. These pole face windings are so arranged that the mmf produced by currents flowing in these windings opposes the armature mmf. This is shown in the developed diagram of Fig. 6a. The compensating winding is connected in series with the armature winding so that its mmf is proportional to the armature mmf. Figure 6b shows a schematic diagram and Fig 6c shows the stator of a dc machine having compensating windings. These pole face windings are expensive. Therefore they are used only in large machines or in machines that are subjected to abrupt changes of armature current. The dc motors used in steel rolling mills are large as well as subjected to rapid changes in speed and current. Such dc machines are always provided with compensating windings.']	['<urn:uuid:07fa3c18-7953-4f8c-887e-9edfd79546c1>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	14	73	1112
5	I'm worried about ocean pollution. How much plastic enters the oceans yearly?	Approximately eight million tonnes of plastic enters the oceans every year, and there may already be 150 million tonnes of plastic in the oceans based on estimated leakages per year since 1950.	"[""ASEAN is once again in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons, this time after the newly formed Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW) singled out the region for its disproportionate contribution to plastic waste in the environment – especially the ocean.\nApproximately eight million tonnes of plastic enters the oceans every year – and there may already be 150 million tonnes of it based on estimated leakages per year since 1950. Advocacy group Ocean Conservatory stated that nearly 80 percent of plastic waste in the ocean begins as litter on land – and that over 90 percent of river borne plastic found in the ocean comes from 10 major rivers around the world, eight are in Asia.\nWith the region among the worst ocean polluters, the AEPW – which was formed last month by 30 giants of industry across the plastics and consumer goods value chain – have promised to fund various programmes to reduce plastic waste in Southeast Asia.\nExcessive plastic use and inefficient waste collection and recycling have been among Southeast Asia’s biggest environmental problems. A 2017 report by Ocean Conservancy stated that China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam have been dumping more plastic into the ocean than the rest of the world combined.\nSource: Less Plastic UK\nThe large concentration of plastic waste in Southeast Asia is due to the lack of investment in waste management infrastructure, and the APEW aim to change that by channelling funds to counter the problem – promising to create a circular economy for plastics with part of their initial global investment of US$1 billion.\n“If you’re working on the ground in South and Southeast Asia, or wherever plastic pollution is happening, and you try to talk about solutions, the biggest question that always comes up is ‘who is going to pay for it?’,” said Rob Kaplan, founder and chief executive officer of Circulate Capital – a company working with the AEPW to fund entrepreneurship in collection and processing sites for recycling plastic waste.\nPartnering with Ocean Conservatory, Circulate Capital wants to move plastic waste out of the environment and into the recycling value chain by targeting five countries – India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam – which have been replacing China as the world’s dumping ground for solid recyclable waste.\nThe world’s new dumping ground\nA Chinese ban on waste imports at the start of 2018 disrupted an industry that handled more than seven million tonnes of plastic waste annually. Malaysia took over China’s mantle and imported 456,000 tonnes of plastic waste from January to July 2018 – in stark contrast to the 168,500 tonnes it imported in 2016 and 316,600 tonnes in 2017, respectively.\nThe world's top exporter of plastic waste, the United States (US) sent 178,238 tonnes of its plastic waste to Malaysia between January and July 2018 according to the United Nations (UN) and the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries. This amount is nearly twice as much as the US sent to Thailand, its second top destination for plastic waste.\nAnalysis of US trade data by Unearthed, Greenpeace UK’s journalism arm, showed that a surge in scrap imports led to nearly half of US plastic waste – which was normally sent to China – shift to Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam in the first six months of 2018.\nSoutheast Asia is waking up though, and Malaysia last year issued a permanent ban on the import of plastic waste and announced it will be phasing out the import of other types of plastic by 2021. Vietnam has banned the issuance of licences for the import of plastic waste and Thailand will also stop plastic waste imports by 2021.\n‘Stop dreaming and start reducing’\nDespite Southeast Asia being guilty of dumping plastic waste in the ocean, industries also have to shoulder their fair share of the blame for their lack of eco-friendly manufacturing processes.\nFormed by some of the world’s biggest companies such as Shell, Dow, Procter & Gamble and Reliance Industries, critics have blasted the AEPW’s motives and argue that their efforts would be better placed in reducing plastic use and waste in general from their manufacturing and supply chain processes.\n“The industry coalition’s promise to solve the plastic pollution crisis with waste management and clean-up is a nice dream, but it’s not sufficient to solve the plastic problem,” said Jacqueline Savitz, chief policy officer of ocean advocacy group, Oceana in a statement last month.\n“Companies that make and use single-use plastic need to act now by prioritising the only guaranteed tool – plastics use reduction – and consumers should demand that these companies turn the tide by significantly scaling back their unnecessary use of single-use plastic.\n“It’s time for those responsible for the problem to stop dreaming and start reducing.”""]"	['<urn:uuid:57cf2bf1-076f-45ff-bd4d-4e813d16b76a>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	12	32	794
6	I noticed some interesting patchwork textiles from Pakistan and would love to know more about their history - where do they come from and what makes them unique?	These specific textiles, known as rallis, originated from Sindh, Pakistan in the 1970s. They represent a unique non-western fusion of humans and machines, where Sindhi weavers took machine-printed offcuts from new textile mills near Karachi and stitched them using traditional running stitch in different colored threads. Initially created for practical purposes, these textiles became internationally influential, with buyers from Japan, Nigeria, and the Middle East visiting Sindh, leading to a constant fusion and remixing of color palettes and print patterns.	"[""Shezad Dawood & Priya Ahluwalia’s Eloquent Artistic Collaboration Wins Hearts At Brussels\n- 9 Aug '23\n- 11:32 am by Urvi Kothari\nIn today’s cross-collaborative era, it has become imperative to push the boundaries of multi-disciplinary practices. Pushing the envelope of a defined canon of artistic practices, British-Pakistani artist Shezad Dawood creates an immersive dystopian world – an intrinsic world-building relationship based on sensorial experiences, movement, sound, art, and imagined virtual reality.\nIn response to Yusef Lateef’s music and drawings, while Dawood’s vintage patchwork textiles come to life, designer Priya Ahluwalia’s wearable art presents an ensemble of hybrid humans choreographing their way into a ‘Night in the Garden of Love’. In conversation with Shezad and Priya, we talk about their shared love for diverse silhouettes, immersive art experiences, the future of wearable art, and much more.\nDesign Pataki: What was your instinctive response when you first encountered Lateef’s novella ‘Night in the Garden of Love’?\nShezad Dawood: Déja Vu is an overused cliché, but I definitely felt like there was a deeper truth embodied in the novella that I already knew at some subconscious level and was just waiting to encounter. The relationship between ecology, sound, movement, and new ways of imagining a more enlightened future felt ahead of its time and relevant to some of our most pressing challenges as a global community.\nDesign Pataki: How have Yusef Lateef’s drawings – on the depiction of sound – inspired you to curate this entire collection?\nShezad Dawood: Lateef’s drawings move through what appears to be more abstract and geometrical interval drawings, depicting musical scales and notation, to those that feature recognisable imagery such as tree and plant forms. What inspired me from years of speaking to Lateef’s widow, collaborators and students was the way he moved from composition to drawing, and the obvious relationship established between them [two mediums].\nThis relationship was further confirmed by an anecdote of Lateef walking into an exhibition held during his lifetime, where he took out a flute and began playing one of the tree drawings. So this idea of all the drawings bridging the visual and auditory dimensions informed my desire to take audiences on a similar journey to the one I’d been on in terms of understanding the drawings, across the spectrum of perceived abstraction to figuration.\nDesign Pataki: A podcast mentioned the origin of these textiles stemming from your home province in Sindh, Pakistan from the 1970s. Would you like to share any personal anecdotes or stories behind the textile collection used for your body of works?\nShezad Dawood: I have been experimenting with many styles of textiles – vintage and contemporary – for a while now, but for this very personal dialogue with Lateef I wanted to return to my use of these specific rallis. What I love about these textiles from the 1970s is that they embody an unusual and specifically non-western idea of the hybridisation of humans and machines. Sindhi weavers started taking machine-printed offcuts from the new and booming textile mills on the outskirts of 1970s Karachi and stitched them using their traditional running stitch in different coloured thread. These were initially for utilitarian purposes, but I always loved their hybridity and assemblage-like quality. Interestingly, in the 1970s buyers from Japan, Nigeria, and the Middle East came to Sindh; so the colour palettes and print patterns were constantly being fused and remixed.\nDesign Pataki: According to you, how did Priya’s costume add to the overall exhibition tonality?\nShezad Dawood: Well, I always see an exhibition as a score, one that is all about music and movement. With Night in the Garden of Love, I always knew I wanted to work with Priya again, based on our shared love of upcycled textiles and dynamic movement.\nPriya’s costumes were always for me an essential part of the piece, as they bring the piece into the physicality of the body, and back into the exhibition through live dance performances taking place every Sunday [across the exhibit duration]. Most importantly, they allow the audience to imagine themselves transforming into the characters from Lateef’s novella. So they have both a physical and an imaginary component.\nDesign Pataki: What was the genesis behind designing the costume aesthetic for this curation?\nPriya Ahluwalia: The genesis behind designing this particular costume aesthetic stemmed from working with Shezad to understand his approach to depicting a dystopian reality. I had a compelling vision of a mutant/hybrid human existing within a dystopian reality. Through a thoughtful amalgamation of selective textiles, I sought to portray a fluid form that is coexistent with nature. The fluidity and movement of these draped elements lend an illusion, adding to the enchanting aura of the design. Notably, both costumes incorporate a bodysuit that fully covers the face.\nThis intentional choice effectively removes the defining features of humans, introducing an element of the hybrid human. In doing so, we aimed to blur the boundaries between the body and its extensions, creating a captivating and thought-provoking visual narrative that leaves a lasting impression on the audience.\nDesign Pataki: How do you see the future of wearable art at the confluence of textile art and costume design? Do you see contemporary performance art extending beyond defined canons of art and fashion?\nPriya Ahluwalia: The future of wearable art and costume design is promising and dynamic. These two creative realms transport us into different realms and allow us to dream. I hope to continue to explore the tapestry of innovation and imagination as it unfolds. Contemporary performance art serves as a powerful catalyst in this convergence, extending beyond the defined canons of art and fashion.\nBreaking barriers and redefining traditional notions, it opens up new avenues for artistic expression and experimentation. Advancements in technology and AI will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of wearable art. I see the incorporation of textile art and costume design remaining intrinsic to wearable art, as textile art plays a foundational role in bringing depth and character to each creation.\nDesign Pataki: As an appreciator, if you had to describe the ‘Night in the Garden of Love’ experience in a few words, how would it be read as?\nPriya Ahluwalia: The ‘Night in the Garden of Love’ is a meticulously crafted masterpiece, drawing you into realms of boundless creativity. You find yourself submerged in an immersive, multifaceted, and intriguing wonderland!\nThe exhibition is on display at WIELS in Brussels till August 13, 2023""]"	['<urn:uuid:8ac8dd25-479e-42f5-86ee-3dd562d48b54>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	28	80	1073
7	As someone interested in game theory and politics, I'm curious - what's the connection between political leadership and coordinating people's expectations?	One of the basic functions of political leadership is to coordinate people's expectations in games with multiple equilibria. Political leaders serve as general focal arbitrators for situations throughout society where other cultural norms don't apply or require interpretation. Their ability to coordinate expectations comes from what we call legitimacy (or charisma when intrinsic to personality), which can be based on particular cultural and historical factors, such as traditional recognition of a royal family.	"['Paper: Learning from Schelling\'s \'Strategy of Conflict\'\nMy notes on\nLEARNING FROM SCHELLING\'S \'STRATEGY OF CONFLICT\'\nMyerson, Roger B. 2009. ""Learning from Schelling\'s Strategy of Conflict."" Journal of Economic Literature, 47 (4): 1109-25.\nMeyerson\'s conclusions up top:\n- (21) Different kinds of social relationships, individual reputations, and social positions can be understood as alternative equilibria in an economic model.\n- (22) Thus, basic questions of political theory can be understood in terms of the general focal coordination problem.\n- (23) The focal-point effect may even offer a perspective on some ideas of theology, not about the nature of the divine, but about how societies use the divine.\n(5) anything in a game\'s environment or history that focuses the players\' attention on one equilibrium may lead them to expect it, and so rationally to play it.\nDUSTIN: Cash money only has value because we all assume it has value (This is not strictly true but it\'s an interesting idea, consider Bitcoin or Tech stocks or Housing prices)\nThis focal-point effect opens the door for cultural and environmental factors to influence rational behavior ... But in a theoretical model where individuals\' preferences are endogenously determined, one might ""solve"" social problems by teaching the poor to love poverty, or by teaching the powerful to love social justice. Economic analysis of institutions could thus be trivialized by such an assumption that\nindividuals could be culturally reshaped to fit institutional requirements.\nDUSTIN: Idea: Does a North Korean recognize the extent of the propoganda-state they live in? How do you, dear reader, know you have not already been ""re-shaped""?\nSo economists find it more useful to assume that an exogenous selfish materialism characterizes individual preferences. But even without an intrinsic preference for justice,\nselfish materialists can be influenced by concepts of justice that operate as focal factors to determine focal equilibria\nDUSTIN: Idea is even if we throw away morality, it is individually advantageous to agree on a justice system. The particulars of the justice system are not important, just that the agreement exists. For example, Libertarian ideology is structured around: ""individualism, private property, capitalism, equality under the law"" cato. Here, this is just one possible set of values (focal factors); from a game theoretic perspective there are other stable solutions.\nin games with multiple equilibria. ... the process of negotiating joint expectations of focal equilibrium may be the only sense in which players can truly ""co-operate,"" because the understanding of a focal equilibrium must be shared jointly by all players. As Harsanyi (1961) recognized, theories about cooperative games may then be posed as theories of how focal equilibria can be identified from the payoff allocations that they yield.\n(6) Imagine for a moment that we tried to induce people in real games to play the equilibrium that is selected for them by a theory such as Harsanyi and Selten\'s. The players in these games might think that, in our attempt to coordinate them, we were trying to act as leaders with some kind of authority over them. That is, they might recognize something intrinsically political about our attempt to coordinate them on one equilibrium rather than another, because\none of the basic functions of political leadership is to coordinate people\'s expectations in games with multiple equilibria.\nIn this sense, Harsanyi and Selten (1988) were trying to define a neutral political theory, based on a new kind of natural law, which could be compared in scope to the efforts of Thomas Hobbes (1651), albeit in a very different analytical framework. Schelling\'s response to Harsanyi then could be compared to David Hume\'s (1748) observation that general public opinion may be the only standard for questions of morals (unlike other areas of philosophical inquiry), because the\nfundamental basis of social morals is in people\'s need to coordinate with each other.\nSchelling\'s focal-point effect should be counted as one of the most important ideas in social theory. Recognizing the fundamental social problem of selecting among multiple equilibria can help us to better understand the economic impact of culture on basic social phenomena such as social relationships, property and justice, political authority and legitimacy, foundations of social institutions, reputations and commitment, international boundaries in peace and war, and even the social use of the divine.\nTable 1: A game with good and bad equilibria. (The stag-hunt game.)\n(7) As the strategies\' names suggest, the different equilibria here can be interpreted as representing, in a simple model, different kinds of interpersonal relationships. The players here can rationally have a friendly relationship, but they can just as rationally have an unfriendly aggressive relationship, even though it makes them both worse off.\nEconomists have sometimes suggested that a Nash equilibrium that is Pareto-dominated by another Nash equilibrium should never be predicted by our theories. If we included this Pareto constraint in our analytical methodology, then we would get a unique and pleasant prediction in this game, because the good (50,50) equilibrium Pareto-dominates all other equilibria here. But such a methodological assumption would blind us to the\npossibility of important social pathologies where people become focused on the bad equilibrium.\nSuppose that this game is played in a context where, based on cultural expectations and the experiences of players in similar situations, aggressive behavior becomes the normal expectation. Then each player should rationally respond to this expectation by fulfilling it himself.\nNeither player can improve the situation by himself. The pathology of the aggressive equilibrium here is a social pathology that derives from their mutual expectations of each other. To improve individuals\' prospects in this game requires a social change, that is, a change of generally held social expectations.\n(8) Now imagine two different islands, each of which is inhabited by people who are matched in pairs to play this game each day. Suppose that people on the first island are culturally disposed to focus on the good equilibrium, but on the second island the players are culturally disposed to focus on the bad equilibrium. Then we have a\nsimple model of impoverishment that is purely cultural in origin.\nBy modeling local culture as a focal factor, rather than as a factor that affects individuals\' preferences, we can meaningfully compare payoffs across the two islands, because moving from one island to the other would not change a player\'s preferences. The two islands have the same economic fundamentals, but the economic outcomes are worse on the second island because the cultural expectations are different. All individuals on both islands are equally rational, but an individual on the poor island who tried to fix the problem by acting as if he were on the rich island would reduce his own payoff from 20 to 0.\nIf we want to cure the poverty of the second island, we must get everyone\'s attention there and somehow get them all to focus instead on the better equilibrium.\nSuch pathological social expectations can be changed only by someone who perceived as an authority or leader, and who can identify a better Nash equilibrium for them.\nOf course the social problems of poverty actually arise in complex social systems where different equilibria are much harder to identify than in this simple example. In a game that has many equilibria, there are typically many more strategy combinations that are not Nash equilibria. A would-be reformer who wants to improve social welfare by changing people\'s behavior to a better equilibrium must take care to identify a social plan that is in fact a Nash equilibrium, so that nobody can profit by unilaterally deviating from the plan. If a leader tries to change people\'s expectations to some plan that is not a Nash equilibrium, then his exhortations to change behavior would be undermined by rational deviations. The point of this example is that, even when the better equilibrium is well understood, there still remains a nontrivial social problem of how to change everyone\'s expectations to the better equilibrium. Such coordinated social change requires some form of socially accepted leadership, and thus it may depend on factors that are essentially political.\n(10) Plato\'s Republic (book 1) includes a definition of justice as giving each person what is due to him. In this sense, a shared social expectation of who should claim and who should defer in this game is indeed justice. If any shared cultural concept of justice suggests that 1 should claim and 2 should defer in this game, then the players should rationally play that equilibrium. Player 2 may regret this equilibrium, as she gets 0 in it, but the expectation of 1\'s just claim here should make 2 anticipate that her ""unjustly"" claiming here would reduce her own payoff to\n. Thus Schelling\'s focal-point effect enables us to understand how social concepts of justice can influence rational behavior, even when people are motivated only by their own self-interest, with no intrinsic desire to act justly. The behavior of selfish materialists can be decisively influenced by justice as a social concept that designates the focal equilibrium in such games of multiple equilibria. With such a multiple-equilibrium model of ownership, it is easy to see how the allocation of property rights can be influenced by symbolic rituals like a verbal promise over a handshake, as\nthese rituals can change the socially expected equilibrium of the claiming game.\nWith such a multiple-equilibrium model of ownership, it is easy to see how the allocation of property rights can be influenced by symbolic rituals like a verbal promise over a handshake, as these rituals can change the socially expected equilibrium of the claiming game. ... the word of a recognized authority or focal arbitrator can allocate valuable property rights without any enforcement mechanism other than people\'s desire to avoid costly conflict. ... The players can be coordinated in this way only if they have a shared perception of who has jurisdiction over their case and when his judgment is final.\n(11) To focus attention on one equilibrium with no higher appeal, it would be best to consult the highest possible authority. If the players share a cultural understanding that certain unpredictable processes may be used by the fundamental divine spirit of the universe to answer questions, and that this divinity cannot be bothered about the same question more than once, then a recommendation that is based on such a sacred randomization can serve as a focal coordination device that cannot be appealed to any higher arbitrator. Then the oracle\'s recommendations can be self-enforcing, without any further intervention by the divine spirit, provided that the recommendations to the players form an equilibrium. Thus the focal-point effect can admit a socially significant role for\noracles and divination, as an effective foundation for social coordination.\nIndeed, when we look for effective focal factors, what can command people\'s attention more than the overall pattern of the whole universe? This divine pattern can serve as a focal determinant, however, only when players have a shared understanding about it can be interpreted into a selection among the set of Nash equilibria of their game.\n(12) rival-claimant games. Where property rights are unclear, people might gather in occasional assemblies to approve new rules for identifying which player should claim in more of these matches; from a Darwinian competition among cultures, we derive a general principle that\nevery successful society must have well-developed concepts of justice and authority that enable their members to identify efficient focal equilibria in most of the games that they commonly play.\nDUSTIN: The rules of the game have changed and the old focal equilibria are efficient no longer. This idea is an economic basis for the need for a new world order to establish new focal equilibria which are efficient.\nSuch models offer a new perspective on the nature of politics and the state. We may see political leaders as general focal arbitrators for games throughout society where other cultural norms do not apply or require interpretation.\n(13) Focal factors that bestow such coordination power on a leader may be called legitimacy (or charisma when they are intrinsic to the leader\'s personality). By the focal-point effect, the selection of legitimate leadership in any society can depend on its particular culture and history, such as a local tradition of identifying a particular family as royal.\n... the same forces that help people to achieve consistent coordinated expectations in a successful society can become forces for inconsistency of expectations across societies in international relations.\nIndeed, in international conflicts throughout history, people on each side have regularly failed to understand the other side\'s perception of justice in their conflict.\nDUSTIN: Light speed communication is the rule-change that rendered the old focal equilibria obselete. The current solution is no longer stable. Light speed communication is fundamentally about diversity; suddenly, people of different experiences who don\'t undertand one another – don\'t share a common set of Schelling points – are smashed toegher. This fully explains the chaos of the modern age. The solution is a new global Schelling point – a New World Order.\n(14) Game theorists regularly consider institutions as games, so that an institutional reform can be analyzed as a change in the rules of a game. But at a deeper level, we should also ask how such institutional games can be reformed or established in the first place. Having found focal coordination problems at the foundations of the state, we should recognize the essential role of Schelling\'s focal-point effect in such analysis.\nTo ask game-theoretically how an institution is established, we must consider the institution as a game that is embedded in a larger and more fundamental game, which Hurwicz (2008) calls the true game. ... To provide a framework in which different institutions could be established with different patterns of individual behavior, the larger true game must have multiple equilibria. Then an institutional reform and its induced changes in people\'s behavior can be understood in this framework as a change from one focal equilibrium to another. Indeed, without multiple equilibria, it would be difficult to understand how a\nrevolutionary change of national institutions can dramatically change so much\nin a nation where the population and resources have not substantially changed in any material aspects.\n(15) In Hurwicz\'s (2008) framework, establishing an institution means ruling out certain strategies that are feasible in the true game of life but are ""illegal"" under the rules of the institution. So given a normal-form game that describes the true game of life, an institution would be described by listing the nonempty set of strategies for each player that are legal in the institution. Then we may say that the institution\'s rules are rationally enforceable iff the utility- maximizing best responses for any player are always legal strategies whenever the other players are all expected to use legal strategies\nDUSTIN: This explains the business cycle, and why businesses fail and are replaced by new businesses. This is also the key to power: identify that the rules are changing, and influence the new Schelling point, for it\'s rise will be inevitable as the old balance fails.\n(19) Notice that the critical reputation here is how this nation is perceived by those other nations that it wants to deter, because it is their behavior that is supposed to change if the nation deviated from the deterrent strategy. Thus Schelling discovered the\nparadoxical fact that an effective deterrent strategy requires coordination with the adversaries who are supposed to be deterred by it.\nWe are familiar with the need to coordinate with our allies in international conflict, but the importance of coordinating with our adversaries is less intuitive. Our strategy will not have the desired deterrent effect if it is not generally understood and recognized by our potential adversaries. Furthermore, we cannot be credibly held to a deterrent strategy unless our potential adversaries understand it in detail and can judge our correct implementation of it. If the terms of our deterrent strategy are vague or ambiguous, then in any specific case we would be tempted to deny our obligation to fulfill any costly promise or threat. Rational foundations for international law of war (jus ad bellum) can be derived from this basic argument that the strategic conditions for deterrent military responses need to be generally recognized and verifiable.\nOf course a nation may have many different strategies which, if anticipated by others, could all have the same desired deterrent effect. Thus, the problem of sustaining a credible deterrent strategy is a problem of\nnegotiating a focal equilibrium in a dynamic game that has multiple equilibria,\nwhere the other players include potential adversaries around the world.\nDUSTIN: The current world order (Capitalism and Democracy) is just one negotiated focal point. And by negotiated I mean that it was forced upon the world by the USA in the post- World War II vaccuum of power.']"	['<urn:uuid:7a8050c7-b90d-41d0-9a75-a8095d98b203>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	21	73	2792

Back in 2011 Adam received a call from an AD agency that was trying to unload remnant billboards to artists. It was during the recession, so these kind of deals were coming up once in a while. But even at a discounted rate, the boards were still too expensive for an artist to rent. However, a thought popped into Adam’s head: how wonderful would it be to exhibit artworks on billboards for a wide audience of people driving by everyday? So Adam tested the idea and rented one billboard to display his own artwork for a month. During that time, he observed curious people interacting with the billboard; pedestrians stopped by to look at the board, a couple of people even took selfies with it. It was really interesting to see the idea come to life. So in 2012 Adam founded The Billboard Creative, a non profit organization with one mission: to use remnant billboards and turn them into public art. What started as a test in 2011, became an exhibition of 15 billboards in 2014. In the Spring of 2015, Adam invited me to step in as an LA-artist and curator. It has since grown so much, this week we have 33 artwork billboards coming up in Los Angeles, with one mission, to stop traffic with art!\nImage shown on billboard above: © Jack Pierson, Billboard location: Santa Monica East of Vine, North Side, Facing West - Los Angeles, CA\nKK: The list of artists selected this year includes Ed Ruscha, Jack Pierson, Andrew Bush, Shane Guffogg, Kim McCarty, Panos Tsagaris and many others. What characteristics draw your attention to specific artists? Who should be encouraged to submit and exhibit at The Billboard Creative?\nMK: A billboard exhibition can be a challenging proposition. We’re competing for attention within a busy urban setting, with an audience mostly inside their cars commuting. My first step was to observe traffic and study audience behavior. There were two distinct situations observed: people would be either driving by swiftly, or completely stuck in a traffic jam. Considering the first scenario, my intention is to grab their attention by surprise with graphically strong artworks, pieces that are easy to read and understand in a relatively short amount of time. That was the case with artworks selected from artists such as Panos Tsagaris, Jack Pierson, Andrew Bush, Ed Ruscha, Carolyn Doucette, among others. But I also saw a need to reach out to an audience who might be stuck in a traffic jam, feeling somewhat impatient and helpless. I thought about artworks that had the power to transport my thoughts momentarily away from that jam and inspire me to mentally escape the traffic. Some of the works selected were the delicate watercolors from Kim McCarty, the handmade knitted sculptures from Thomas Chung and the emotional colors present in Robert Zuchowski\'s paintings. All works had a touch of sublime to me.\nKK: Where are the billboards located and how was this decided?\nMK: The locations and intersections for the billboards are pretty great. The billboard exhibition is concentrated in intersections around West Hollywood and Hollywood. I asked them to concentrate most locations by gallery or museum areas. It was not easy to guarantee space, as you can imagine, but it all worked out. Santa Monica and Highland (by Regen Projects), Beverly and La Brea, Sunset and Western, Fairfax in front of LACMA, Melrose by the gates of Paramount Studios. You can see the list online at www.thebillboardcreative.com. The two billboard companies facilitating TBC exhibitions are Clear Channel and Outfront; they\'re very artist-supportive and helpful!\nKK: How does ArtMoi compliment the billboard exhibition?\nMK: I thought it was important to provide a mobile map of the show. It’s an app anyone can download that shows the locations of the billboards and offers further info on the artists and their works. Similar to a museum audio guide, but outside of the conventional walls of an institution.\nImage shown on billboard above: © Carolyn Doucette, Billboard location: Hollywood West of Bronson, South Side, Facing West - Los Angeles, CA\nKK: In one of your interviews, you mentioned using Gauguin’s painting Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? as the basis for your creative source — timeless and universal questions we all have. With the TBC initiative, what questions do you want to provoke in thousands of people during their daily commute?\nMK: My main goal was to stop traffic with art: to bring artwork from gallery and museum walls and into the streets; to interact with a much wider and egalitarian audience in hopes of touching a nerve here and there for a split second; to offer a surprise, a small seed for thought.\nKK: What were the greatest challenges faced while curating TBC?\nMK: When Adam Santelli from TBC invited me to curate the second Billboard Creative exhibition to be displayed all over intersections in LA proper, I had no idea we would receive a substantial amount of great artworks. I was impressed with the quality of the works submitted. It was also a very interesting process for me, from an artist’s point of view. The artworks selected where based on the criteria mentioned to you earlier, but we still had at least 100 great works that needed to be narrowed down to 33 billboard placements. The final selection was the hardest as all works were equally strong to me. It is interesting to know that I selected them based on the artwork only. I did not have the name of the artists together with the works. It was all based on the artwork standing on its own. The final selection was based on bringing a balance to the final group of 33 artworks. It was not an easy task, but I would do it all over again.\nImage shown on billboard above: © Kim McCarty, Billboard location: Melrose and Gower South East, Facing West - Los Angeles, CA\nKK: Starting with a single billboard, TBC has grown tremendously over the past years. What feedback have you received?\nMK: It will be interesting to see what feedback we receive this year. So far, we’ve received very positive feedback from the artist community. There is open and positive communication going on through social media. It’s fun to observe it taking on a life of its own.\nKK: Tell us more about TBC and the nonprofit organization’s objectives overall.\nMK: Nobody got paid for their efforts; it’s literally a labor of love. When they contacted me, their main interest was to have an artist curate other artists’ works — from artist, to artist and for artists type of thinking. In exchange for my time and advice, they offered to place one of my pieces on a billboard. So, I’ve a piece from the Acido Dorado series in this as well.\nImage shown on billboard above: © Ed Ruscha, Billboard location: Melrose West of Wilton, South Side, Facing East - Los Angeles, CA\nKK: What do you foresee in the future for TBC? Have you thought about bringing TBC to other cities?\nMK: Last year, TBC placed 15 contemporary artists’ works on billboards across Los Angeles. This year, we were able to guarantee placement for 33 artworks. We’ve been talking about bringing it to a sister city in the US, or possibly Cuba! It’s been an exciting project, great for artists’ exposure and I’m hoping we can expand it further — fingers crossed!\nKK: What about LA attracts artists?\nMK: It’s probably a combination of incredible light, available space for artist studios, reasonable rental prices and a growing artist community supported by critics, collectors, and institutions. I’m not sure what exactly brings them here, but whatever it is, it doesn’t seem to be available in NY any longer. We’ve been noticing a large amount of artists moving here from the east coast.\nKK: You were born in São Paulo and currently reside in LA, which is referred to as a ""desert city"" by many authors. In your latest body of work, Acido Dorado, you explore a close friend and collaborator’s, Jacintha’s, interactions with the American desert. What entices you about deserts?\nMK: In my own life and work, I would say I have a tendency for minimalism. What draws me to the desert is the incredible light and the vast landscape. It feels like an empty canvas waiting to be brought to life. It has an existential undercurrent that entices my imagination.\nKK: You describe Acido Dorado as ""a mix of California hedonism and surreal desert hallucination."" In this series, your narrative shifted from nudes expressed in the physical body to abstracted expressions of the body. What triggered this shift?\nMK: I think it was a natural tendency and personal wish to push my work forward. It was a privilege for me to create images together with someone I knew for so many years. We are kindred spirits and continue each others’ sentences. Same for creating the work, I would think of someone and before mentioning it, Jacintha would be addressing my thoughts in her body language. It was a real interesting series for me, because most images were shot tangentially to the model, embracing reflections from the surrounding glass panels of the house. The minimal glass house offered a great setting to let go of existing standards and create something new — to find a balance in blending figure, landscape, and variations of abstractions. I’m now finalizing edits for the upcoming book. It will be published by Steidl and released by Fall 2016.\nImage shown on billboard above: © Andrew Bush, Billboard location: Fairfax North of 5th, West Side, Facing South - Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA\nKK: Your first monograph, Photographs, debuted with Steidl more than a decade ago. How do you feel your work has changed over the years?\nMK: Hard to say. I might not have an objective point of view as I’m too close to it. I would probably admit that the basis of my creative source has remained the same — the human being whose beauty (beyond the surface of the skin) and existence remain mysterious to me\nKK: What’s next? What projects are you currently working on?\nMK: Lately, I’ve been really interested in the intellectual and philosophical aspects of the creative community in the 20s, both in Europe and in Los Angeles. I’ve been studying and photographing at the Schindler House here in West Hollywood. Built by the Austrian architect Schindler, it’s considered an early, mid-century masterpiece. I’m interested not only in the architecture, but most importantly for me, in the social theory of that time. I think we still have much to learn and distill from that avant-garde era in LA.']"	['<urn:uuid:d2f2c477-18d8-4cac-9b94-75f28b42ea6b>', '<urn:uuid:c026e398-9873-4134-9dac-ea4bf315bb95>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	6	75	3167
9	hunting tactics redfin australia fish groups	Redfin perch hunt fish both individually and in organized groups. In group hunting, they herd shoals of small fish until encircled or pinned against the bank. Some redfin then chase into the shoal while others hold position to prey on fleeing fish. They also use a method called 'beating', where they flush out insects and small fish from weed beds into open water, where waiting redfin catch them.	"[""Redfin perch (Perca fluviatilis)\nRedfin perch was listed as a Class 1 noxious fish in NSW in December 2010. Other common names: European perch, redfin, English perch, Eurasian perch\nRedfin perch, also known as English perch, is a medium sized freshwater fish native to northern Europe. Redfin perch (redfin) were first introduced to Australia in the 1860s for angling, and are now widespread across much of NSW, ACT, Victoria, Tasmania, south-eastern South Australia and the south-western corner of Western Australia.\nRedfin are a popular sport fish with some anglers because of their fighting qualities and taste. However, they are also voracious predators of other fish and invertebrates, can destroy recreational fisheries in enclosed waters by building up large numbers of stunted fish and eliminating other species, and can devastate native fish populations by carrying the epizootic haematopoietic necrosis (EHN) virus. For these reasons, redfin are considered a serious pest and in December 2010 redfin were listed as a Class 1 noxious species in NSW.\nDescription & biology\nDescription: Redfin belong to the family Percidae. They can be recognised by the following features:\n- a deep body and a slightly forked tail;\n- two distinctly separate dorsal fins, the first with 12-17 strong spines and a distinct black blotch at the rear;\n- a pattern of five or more broad black vertical bands across the back, tapering on the sides (more prominent in younger fish);\n- bright reddish-orange pelvic and anal fins and tail.\nThe body colour varies from olive green to grey on the back, fading to greenish or silvery on the sides and whitish on the belly.\nRedfin can grow to 60 cm in length and around 10 kg in weight, but are more commonly found up to 45 cm and 1-2 kg.\nHabitat: Redfin live in a wide variety of habitats, but prefer still or slow-flowing waters such as lakes, dams, billabongs, swamps and slower moving streams and rivers. They prefer areas with good shelter such as snags (submerged dead wood and trees), vegetation or rocks, but have also been caught in open water.\nFeeding: Redfin perch are carnivorous and feed on a wide variety of foods ranging from small invertebrates (such as crustaceans, worms, molluscs and insect larvae) to fish. They are known to hunt fish either solitarily (by ambushing or stalking their prey) or in organised groups. In groups, they herd shoals of small fish until encircled or pinned against the bank; a few of the redfin then chase into the shoal while the majority hold position and prey on fleeing fish. Schools of redfin also use a similar method known as “beating”, where they flush out insects and small fish from weed beds or other shelter into open water, where they become easy prey for waiting redfin. Such methods give them a reputation as voracious predators.\nReproduction: Redfin spawn in late winter and spring, when they lay several hundred thousand eggs in a gelatinous ribbon amongst aquatic vegetation, submerged logs or other sheltered areas. The egg mass is unpalatable to most other fish and is hence generally protected from predation. The eggs develop and hatch in about a week, and the young fish school to help avoid predation. Redfin usually take 2-6 years to reach sexual maturity, but some have been found to be reproductively mature at 1 year of age.\nWhere are they in NSW?\nRedfin are widespread throughout much of NSW and Victoria, particularly the cooler waters on either side of the Great Dividing Range but also into the central parts of each state. They are also known from the ACT, south-eastern South Australia, Tasmania and south-western Western Australia. Their distribution seems to be limited by an upper water temperature of around 31°C and they are rarely found in fast-flowing waters or high altitude areas.\nIn 2006 NSW Department of Primary Industries (NSW DPI) discovered populations of redfin in the upper part of the Lachlan as well as the Abercrombie and Wollondilly catchments. These areas, which were previously free of redfin, support some of the last known NSW populations of threatened native Macquarie perch and southern pygmy perch. In 2008 redfin were confirmed in two new locations - in Wyangala Dam in the Lachlan catchment and Oberon Dam in the Macquarie catchment.\nIn early 2010 NSW DPI acted quickly on a report of redfin in a farm dam in the upper Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment, upstream from Coxs River and Lake Wallace. Redfin had not been recorded in the area previously and this sighting was considered to be a significant threat to Macquarie perch which is known to inhabit the Coxs River while Lake Wallace is an important recreational impoundment for trout and bass.\nNSW DPI with the assistance of local recreational fishing groups drained the dam to eradicate the redfin. The majority of the redfin were dispatched while some were collected from the dam and transferred live to Sydney University for research purposes. Nearby locations were subsequently surveyed for redfin in mid 2010, and none were found.\nKnown and probable distribution of redfin perch in NSW\nNSW Department of Primary Industries and its employees disclaim any liability for an act done on the basis of information in the map and any consequences of such acts or omissions.\nKnown and probable distribution of redfin perch in NSW as at May 2011.\nHow did they get here?Redfin were first introduced to Australia in the 1860s for angling. The recently discovered populations of redfin in the upper Hawkesbury-Nepean, Lachlan, Abercrombie and Wollondilly catchments appear to have been introduced deliberately, as they are geographically isolated from existing populations and could not have spread naturally.\nWhat are their impacts\nEven though redfin have been in Australia for over 100 years, much of the information regarding their impacts is based on personal observations rather than scientific studies. Redfin are voracious predators which consume a wide variety of fish and invertebrates, including small native species such as pygmy perch, rainbowfish and carp gudgeon, and the eggs and fry of larger fish such as silver perch, golden perch, Murray cod and introduced trout.\nThis predation can seriously impact populations of native species and trout, and hence can also affect recreational fisheries for these species. For example, redfin were recorded as eliminating 20,000 newly released rainbow trout fry from a reservoir in south-western Australia in less than 72 hours. Redfin are capable of rapidly populating new waterways and in stable water bodies (such as lakes and dams) they can form very dense populations. Under these conditions, redfin become stunted as they deplete the food supply, becoming worthless for angling.\nIn such large numbers, they can also out-compete most other fish species. One of the most significant threats to native fish from redfin is their potential to spread the viral disease Epizootic Haematopoietic Necrosis (EHN). This disease, which was first isolated in 1985 and is unique to Australia, can cause mass mortality in juvenile redfin perch during the summer months.\nA number of native species, including silver perch, Murray cod, mountain galaxias and particularly Macquarie perch, are highly susceptible to the disease, and EHN virus may be one factor responsible for the decline in various native species over the last couple of decades.\nWhat is NSW DPI doing?\nIn December 2010, NSW DPI listed redfin perch as a Class 1 noxious fish species. This listing recognises the threat that this species causes to native fish populations, and prohibits live possession and sale of the species. For more information on the noxious listing of redfin click on the link below.\n- Commonly asked questions by recreational anglers regarding Class 1 noxious listing of redfin perch in NSW.\nNSW DPI has an ongoing survey program throughout NSW to gather information on the distribution of freshwater fish species, including introduced pest fish such as redfin. The department has undertaken specific surveys to confirm the presence and abundance of redfin in new areas.\nNSW DPI has considered a range of options for targeted control and/or containment of redfin to limit the impacts on threatened species. However, as with all pest fish in open waterways, it currently appears to be impossible to eradicate redfin populations or prevent natural dispersal to new areas.\nSouthern pygmy perch broodstock have been collected from one site under threat from redfin and will be used to form the basis of a conservation stocking program for re-introduction into sites with suitable habitat.\nNSW DPI, together with Sydney University, is investigating the EHN virus carried by redfin and its impacts on native species. This project aims to assist management in several ways including determining the extent of EHN distribution in the Murray-Darling Basin, developing tests to detect presence of EHN antibodies in native fish, assisting the selection of EHN resistant broodstock for conservation stocking activities and informing the development of EHN containment policies.\nThe former Hawkesbury-Nepean Catchment Management Authority funded a NSW DPI project to look at options for excluding redfin from Macquarie perch habitats in that catchment, in response to new redfin populations in the Wollondilly River.\nThis project recommended that a velocity barrier be constructed on the Kedumba River to prevent the spread of redfin into this catchment and also highlighted the need for further research into the effectiveness of other exclusion devices.\nDuring 2010/11 NSW DPI is undertaking research (funded by the Murray Darling Basin Authority) to identify and trial various control techniques for redfin perch and assess the species behaviour using tagging. This project will draw from an international body of knowledge and experience on redfin to identify weaknesses in the species biology that could be exploited to control populations in NSW.\nField trials will be conducted in several locations on the Central Tablelands to assess the effectiveness of particular control techniques. Results of this project will be considered as part of the development of recommendations for a long term control programme for the species.\nThe Recreational Freshwater Fishing Trust has provided support for NSW DPI to conduct a follow up survey of the upper Coxs catchment to detect the presence of redfin and determine whether further spread of the species was prevented following eradication of a population from a farm dam in the catchment in early 2010.\nNSW DPI has completed an awareness raising campaign to alert anglers to the problems this fish can cause. The campaign has involved producing an educational poster (“Say no to feral fish: redfin perch”) which was sent to all NSW fishing licence agents and recreational fishing clubs throughout NSW. This poster was updated in early 2010 and sent to NSW fishing licence agents and Fisheries Offices in inland areas.\nHow you can help\n- Possession and sale of live noxious fish such as redfin perch is illegal – report any suspected presence of this species in aquarium stores!\n- Report any redfin sightings outside known range to NSW DPI (see map above for known range)\n- Don’t transfer redfin between waterways or introduce them into farm dams - it's illegal! New populations of redfin can quickly build up to large numbers, leading to stunted fish which are poor angling and poor eating and replace other recreational species.\n- Don’t use live redfin (or any other live finfish) as bait in freshwater - it’s illegal and carries a high risk of infesting new areas with redfin.\n- Don’t return redfin to the water – large redfin are good sport and eating fish and there are no bag or size limits on them. NSW DPI encourages that any caught redfin are humanely dispatched immediately and utilised or disposed of in an appropriate manner. Anglers should be aware that it is illegal to be in possession of a live redfin, and the catch can only be stored dead, such as on ice in an esky. For more information see ‘Commonly asked questions by recreational anglers regarding Class 1 noxious listing of redfin perch in NSW’.\n- Obtain a permit to stock fish – and buy fingerlings from a registered hatchery to prevent contamination with unwanted species.\n- Prevent unwanted hitchhikers – check, clean, and dry boats and gear between waterways. Ensuring your boat and trailer are free of weed before re-launching can help avoid the possibility of spreading redfin eggs and juveniles.\n- Assist efforts to restore our rivers (which can help native fauna to out-compete redfin and other pest fish), for example by taking part on a RiverCare or LandCare project or by conserving and restoring riparian vegetation on your own land.\n- Take part in native fish restocking programs with your local angling group.""]"	['<urn:uuid:a07c7be5-524f-4688-b74d-edb992e5fdec>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	6	68	2088
10	combination of which two triads creates hexatonic scales d major hexatonic e minor hexatonic	The D major hexatonic and E minor hexatonic scales are created by combining D major triad (D F# A) and E minor triad (E G B).	['In the April 2015 issue of Guitar World, I showed you how to combine D major (D F# A) and E minor (E G B) triads to generate two appealing hexatonic (six-note) scales: the bright, joyous-sounding D major hexatonic (D E F# G A B) and the dark and serious E minor hexatonic (E F# G A B D).\nAs we saw, both scales are made up of the same notes, the only difference being their orientation around either a D or an E root. I’d now like to present a neat twist on this formula, one that yields two hauntingly beautiful hexatonics, both of which could serve as useful resources whenever you’re looking to create a mysterious, exotic musical mood.\nThe twist is, instead of combining E minor and D major triads, we’re now going to combine D minor (D F A) and E major (E G# B), as demonstrated in FIGURE 1 with two sets of chord inversions moving up the fretboard. In both cases, the notes on the highest of the three strings outline the scale and the notes on the two lower strings offer harmony.\nYou may recognize the sounds created by these two ascending chord-scales, as they’re nearly identical to those of the fourth and fifth modes of A harmonic minor (A B C D E F G#), what are known as D “gypsy” minor (or “Hungarian” or “Ukrainian” minor: D E F G# A B C) and E Phrygian-dominant (E F G# A B C D), a mode often associated with both classical music and metal and the virtuosic shredding of Yngwie Malmsteen.\nThe only difference between those seven-note modes and their hexatonic subsets shown in FIGURE 1, which we’ll refer to, respectively, as D “gypsy-minor hexatonic” (D E F G# A B) and E “Phrygian-dominant hexatonic” (E F G# A B D), is the absence of a C note in the hexatonics, which results in a wide, pentatonic-like gap between B and D. D gypsy-minor hexatonic sports a minor third, F, and major sixth, B, which, together with the second, or ninth, E, create a melancholy Dm6-9 sound (D F A B E).\nIt also features a raised, or “sharped,” fourth, G#, which lends the scale a bitter, dissonant bite that, to me, brings to mind the folk music of Transylvania and neighboring regions of Southeastern Europe. E Phrygian-dominant hexatonic melodically describes an E7 sound (E G# B D) and also includes a fourth, A, and flatted second/ninth, F, which together conjure a feeling of suspense and tension.\nTo me, this scale has a Middle-Eastern or North-African vibe. Both scales and their respective tonal centers—D minor and E major—yearn to resolve to their parent A minor tonality, and it’s the postponement or denial of this resolution that creates musical drama.\nFIGURE 2 is a fluid-sounding legato run in 6/8 meter that demonstrates a useful two-octave path for both of these shared-note hextonic scales that diagonally crosses the middle area of the fretboard. Notice the symmetrically recurring three-notes-per-string shapes and how, at the end of bars 5 and 10, I skip over a note in order to smoothly transition to the other scale. Strive to make all your hammer-ons strong and firm and, when pulling-off, pull the string slightly in toward your palm, in an effort to make all the notes project at an even volume.\nOnce you’ve mastered this run, try doing the same thing with the longer two-and-one-half-octave shapes illustrated in FIGURE 3, both of which are essentially the same three-notes-per-string patterns from FIGURE 2, shifted up five frets and starting on the low E string. Experiment with various rhythms, articulations and phrasing schemes, such as playing straight 16th notes in 4/4 and using alternate picking patterns or bends and slides, as I demonstrate in the video lesson for this column.']	['<urn:uuid:971b34f3-72be-4d93-aa46-74cbd2bd32a5>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	14	26	639
11	im allergist studying severe conjunctival reactions what causes chronic eyelid eczema symptoms	Chronic and constant exposure to an allergenic substance can lead to symptoms including less intense itchiness, dry and scaly eyelid skin, thickening of the affected area, infection secondary to scratching, loss of eyelashes and eyebrow hair, and visual obstruction if there is eyelid or periorbital edema associated.	['What is Eczema on eyelid?\nThe eyelid is a very sensitive area, having the purpose to cover and protect the eye. Compared to the rest of the face skin, the eyelid skin is unbelievably thin and prone to outer allergenic reactions. Also known as atopic dermatitis, this is actually an allergic inflammation of the skin, caused by the application of different cosmetics, hair or face care products in the area. The periorbital area is sensitive to shampoos and other hair products as well, plus there are plenty of substances coming in the air that can irritate the eyelid.\nWhen eczema occurs on the eyelid, the skin becomes red and itchy. Most people have the urge to scratch and rub the eyelids but this will only make the skin in that area prone to infection and even loss of eyelashes or eyebrow hair. It is for the best to refrain from scratching and rubbing, seeking medical attention in case the problem becomes worse. The doctor will not only recommend treatment but also self-care measures that you can follow to stop the itching and prevent a new eczema. It is important to understand that, if the eyelids are always in contact with the allergenic substance, then you run a very good chance of the inflammation becoming chronic, thus requiring more complex treatment.\nWhat are the Symptoms of Eczema on eyelid?\nThe symptoms of eczema on eyelid depend on the source of allergy and the time of exposure. However, there are some general symptoms encountered in all patients and these are:\n- Intense itching, especially at night\n- Redness of the affected outer skin of the eyelid\n- Red and watery conjunctiva (the lacrimal glands will accelerate the tear film in order to eliminate the substance causing the allergy)\n- Lesions of various forms, sizes and shapes – macules, papules, vesicles or blisters\n- Chronic and constant exposure to an allergenic substance can lead to the following symptoms:\n- Itchiness present but less intense\n- The eyelid skin is dry and scaly\n- The affected area becomes thickened in time.\n- Infection secondary to scratching\n- Loss of eyelashes and eyebrow hair\n- Visual obstruction if there is eyelid or periorbital edema associated.\nCauses of Eczema on eyelid\nThe main cause of eczema on eyelid is coming into contact with an irritating substance. The following products can cause allergies, especially in the female population:\n- Cosmetic substances of any kind\n- Make up, eye shadow, mascara\n- Face lotion, perfume, sunscreen\n- Applicators and other tools (brushes, eyelash curlers – especially if they are made from nickel or other allergenic metals, tweezers, makeup sponges)\n- Nail polish or artificial nails because of the frequent contact of the hand and the eye\n- Hair products (shampoo)\n- Certain medications (topical corticosteroids, topical antibiotics, certain ointments for eye problems, solution for cleaning contact lenses)\n- Allergenic substances contained by certain plants (including pollen)\n- Airborne allergens, including chemicals of a volatile nature and different types of sprays\n- Poison ivy (finger to eye contact)\n- Animal hair\n- Tissues used for facial cleaning.\nThe treatment for eczema on eyelid consists of medical solutions and self-care measures. The medical solutions recommended are:\n- Topical corticosteroids – preparations of low potency will be chosen and they will be used only for a short amount of time, as they can have serious side-effects when used on a long term basis.\n- Topical immunomodulators such as calcineurin inhibitors are recommended as an alternative to topical corticosteroids, helping to reduce the redness, inflammation and thickening of the skin.\n- Systemic steroids are recommended only in severe cases of eczema on eyelid and, just as the topical corticosteroids, they should be used for a short period of time to decrease the inflammation.\nThe self care measure recommended to patients who suffer from eczema on eyelid are:\n- Avoid products that may contain specific allergens\n- Use fragrance free products, as these have a reduced chance of producing allergies and eczema\n- Instead of eyelash curlers that are made from nickel be sure to choose those that are made from stainless steel\n- If the eczema is caused by gold jewelry, be sure to wear it for at least amount of time as possible\n- Avoid wearing waterproof makeup, as this will require a strong product for removal\n- Instead, use makeup that is water-soluble and this will only require a gentle cleanser for removal\n- Apply cold compresses to the eyelids in order to reduce the inflammation\n- Avoid hot showers, as these can dry the skin and make it prone to irritation (this is especially valid for the eyelids, as the skin is so thin in that area)\n- Use skin moisturizers that are made from natural ingredients\n- Do not use oil-based cosmetics as these have the tendency to clog the pores and irritate the skin.']	['<urn:uuid:8b6af4df-0e49-4d61-8620-b6d486ff5082>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	12	47	817

This can be done by measuring the ratio of clicks-to-installs, and analysing the share of multi-claim installs by Ad Network.\nSpecifically, upon completion of this training you will be able to answer the following questions:\n- What is the traffic quality of your clicks, impressions and installs?\n- Which of your installs had more than one click, and which of your channels have a higher click-to-install ratio?\nWhat you should know about Click Fraud and Fraud Prevention\nFraud is often misdiagnosed. But when developers encounter click fraud it’s important to perform the right kinds of analyses to arrive at accurate methods for fraud prevention.\nThere are many different kinds of fraudulent activities, but in this training we will focus specifically on multiple-click analysis.\nWhat is Click Fraud?\nClick fraud is the method in which fraudsters attribute random clicks to installs that were originally meant to be organic or attributed to another paid channel—thereby fraudulently claiming credit for those installs.\nHow can Tenjin’s Dashboard help me identify and block fraudulent activity?\nTenjin’s attribution has fraud filters in place that blocks basic fraudulent activity. You can read about the metrics and filters we provide here. This data is available on the Tenjin dashboard.\nIn this training, we will go one step further and customise this analysis by the source or hour of the day.\nSetup options for conducting a multiple-click analysis\nYou can choose from the following options:\nOption 1. Do the analysis yourself:\nWe’ll share the query you need to generate this analysis. Then, you can run this within your BI team, and queries can be edited by them to include additional metrics. If you already have a Tenjin DataVault account, then you can get access to these queries for free.\nOption 2. Do the analysis with Growth FullStack’s Managed Services:\nOur “data pipeline as a service” can deliver raw data, reports, and automated decisions to your data warehouses or tools. If you would like to use this option, then feel free to contact your Growth FullStack Account Manager.\nCustomers who want to run their own ETL can also use this dashboard as a template, to understand the use-cases and spec out the views with your data teams.\nYou can get access to the anonymized template below:\nThis anonymized dashboard is built with Google Data Studio. Click on the link below to view the template.\n[cardlink img=”/static/c4a14729233a543f01a75e120b942092/google-data-studio-big.svg” url=”https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/7d831802-8295-406f-ab66-dd867c52e845/page/6MngB”\nNote: This template can be customised as per your needs. Feel free to get in touch with your Growth FullStack Account Manager for additional details.\nGoogle Data Studio Dashboard views\nThere are 2 views in this dashboard.\nView 1: Ad network installs by minute, analysed against the clicks/impressions per minute\nIn the above analysis, the first graph illustrates the tracked installs by minute for a specific hour across the different network. And the second graph shows a similar analysis for number of clicks and impressions.\nThese graphs are meant to help you identify patterns of potential click fraud. An example would be if, say, Network A displayed just 10 installs out of 100,000 clicks—we can conclude that this is click fraud.\nView 2: Analysing the share of multi-claim installs by network\nOnce we identify that there’s a clear pattern with multi-claim installs, the next step is to look at what share of multiple clicks is attributed to each network; i.e. how many installs are attributed to the network that has recorded more than 1 click.\nThe summary table, then, compares the number of installs with secondary clicks against the total tracked installs. The graph lets you observe by the hour which of your networks had a second click for an install. And the total multi-claim installs in the graph sum up to the “total_secondary_clicks” column in the summary table.\nPlease note that only non-Limit Ad Tracking (non-LAT) users are reflected in this analysis. We observe that in most cases the competition is mutual. For example, if Network A has a second click from network B, then it’s highly possible that network B would also have a second click from Network A. However, if you’re noticing other patterns, feel free to reach out to your Growth FullStack account manager to analyze your data further.\nCan additional channels be included in the graph?\nYes. You can include the ad_network id in the query for additional channels.\nCan I analyse the click behaviour for more than two clicks with this dashboard?\nThis analysis focuses on the last two clicks, as the last click is always the one that gets attributed to an install. With this analysis, you would be able to determine if the distribution of the second last click, along with last click, is always skewed towards a certain direction. This would then require further investigation.\nIf you would like to build another visualisation for more than two clicks, feel free to reach out to your Growth FullStack account manager to discuss the requirements and output.\nCan I export the raw data from the graphs to a .csv format for my own analysis?\nYes, if you click on the three dots in each of the charts in the dashboard, you should be able to sort or export your data.\nDo you have any feedback for us?\nWe at Growth FullStack are always happy to receive your valuable feedback. Whether it’s about requesting additional support on optimizing your workflows, building a customized dashboard, or anything else, feel free to reach out to us and let us know how we can support you further.\nIterate and Maintain\nThis dashboard can be edited to include additional networks. Please read this information on Controls in Google Data Studio before using this dashboard.\nGoogle maintains the Google Data Studio dashboards. Occasionally you might be prompted to re-authenticate your account information. Additionally, please be aware that any changes to the Tenjin DataVault, your custom tables or base query might affect this dashboard.']	['<urn:uuid:fda3ff4d-9927-4bd1-88d8-ba7e21fb27c8>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	8	38	1053

Regions within those strands can spontaneously fold and bind to each other via short complementary base sequences in which As from one sequence specifically bind to Ts from another sequence, and Cs to Gs. Researchers at the Wyss Institute of Biologically Inspired Engineering and elsewhere have used these features to design self-assembling nanostructures such as scaffolded DNA origami and DNA bricks with ever-growing sizes and complexities that are becoming useful for diverse applications. However, the translation of these structures into medical and industrial applications is still challenging, partially because these multi-stranded systems are prone to local defects due to missing stands. In addition, they self-assemble from hundreds to thousands of individual DNA sequences that each need to be verified and tested for high-precision applications, and whose expensive synthesis often produces undesired side products.\nNow, a novel approach published in Science by a collaborative team of researchers from the Wyss Institute, Arizona State University, and Autodesk for the first time enables the design of complex single-stranded DNA and RNA origami that can autonomously fold into diverse, stable, user-defined structures. In contrast to the synthesis of multi-stranded nanostructures, these entirely new types of origami are folded from one single strand, which can be replicated in living cells, allowing their potential low-cost production at large scales and with high purities, opening entirely new opportunities for diverse applications such as drug delivery and nanofabrication.\nEarlier generations of larger-sized origami are composed of a central scaffold strand whose folding and stability requires more than two hundred short staple strands that bridge distant parts of the scaffold and fix them in space. ""In contrast to traditional scaffolded origamis, which are assembled from hundreds of components, our new approach allows us to reliably design and synthesize stable single-stranded and self-folding origami,"" said Wyss Institute Core Faculty member and corresponding author Peng Yin, Ph.D. ""Our fundamentally new approach relies on single-strand folding, rather than multi-component assembly, to produce large nanostructures. This, together with the ability to basically clone and multiply the single component strand in bacteria, presents a game-changing advance in DNA nanotechnology that greatly enhances single-stranded origami\'s potential for real-world applications."" Yin is also co-lead of the Wyss Institute\'s Molecular Robotics Initiative and Professor of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School (HMS).\nTo first enable the production of single-stranded and stable DNA-based origami with distinct folding patterns, the team had to overcome several challenges. In a large DNA strand that goes through a complex folding process, many sequences need to accurately pair up with sequences that are far away from each other. If this process does not happen in an orderly and precise fashion, the strand gets tangled and forms unspecific knots along the way, rendering it useless. ""To avoid this problem, we identified new design rules that we can use to cross DNA strands between different double-stranded regions and developed a web-based automated design tool that allows researchers to integrate many of these events into a folding path leading up to a large knot-free nanocomplex,"" said Dongran Han, Ph.D., the study\'s first author and a Postdoctoral Fellow on Yin\'s team.\nThe largest DNA origami structures created previously were assembled by synthesizing all their constituent sequences individually in vitro and by mixing them together. As a key feature of the new design process, the single-strandedness of the DNA origami allowed the researchers to introduce DNA sequences stably into E. coli bacteria to inexpensively and accurately replicate them with every cell division. ""This could greatly facilitate the development of single-stranded origami for high-precision nanotech like drug delivery vehicles, for example, as only a single easy-to-produce molecule needs to be validated and approved,"" said Han.\nFinally, the team also adapted single-stranded origami technology to RNA, which as a different nucleic acid material offers certain advantages including, for example, even higher production levels in bacteria, and usefulness for potential intra-cellular and therapeutic RNA applications. Translating the approach to RNA also scales up the size and complexity of synthetic RNA structures 10-fold compared to previous structures made from RNA.\nTheir proof-of-concept analysis also proved that protruding DNA loops can be precisely positioned and be used as handles for the attachment of functional proteins. In future developments, single-stranded origami could thus be potentially functionalized by attaching enzymes, fluorescent probes, metal particles, or drugs either to their surfaces or within cavities inside. This could effectively convert single-stranded origami into nanofactories, light-sensing and emitting optical devices, or drug delivery vehicles.\n""This new advance by the Wyss Institute\'s Molecular Robotics Initiative transforms an exciting laboratory research methodology into a potentially transformative technology that can be manufactured at large scale by leveraging the biological machinery of living cells. This work opens a path by which DNA nanotechnology and origami approaches may be translated into products that meet real-world challenges,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at HMS and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children\'s Hospital, as well as Professor of Bioengineering at Harvard\'s John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS).\n""The results announced today establish DNA nanotechnology as a viable alternative approach for applications that have the potential to benefit all of us and the Nation as a whole,"" said Jim Kurose, Assistant Director of the National Science Foundation\'s (NSF) Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE). ""We are delighted this work was supported by NSF\'s Expeditions in Computing program, which has, over the last decade funded large teams of researchers to pursue ambitious, fundamental research agendas that help define and shape the future of computer and information science and engineering, and impact our national competitiveness.""\nBesides Yin and Han, the study includes corresponding authors Hao Yan, Ph.D., and Fei Zhang, Ph.D., Director and Assistant Professor at the Biodesign Center for Molecular Design and Biomimetics at Arizona State University, Tempe, respectively, and Byoungkwon An, Ph.D., Principle Research Scientist at Autodesk Research, San Francisco; Shuoxing Jiang, Ph.D., Xiaodong Qi, and Yan Liu, Ph.D., Assistant Professor from the Biodesign Institute; Cameron Myhrvold, Ph.D., Bei Wang, and Mingjie Dai, Ph.D., past and present members of Yin\'s team at the Wyss Institute; and Maxwell Bates, who worked with An.

14	similarities differences germany family reunions korean war reunions berlin wall	Both German and Korean families experienced painful separations due to Cold War divisions, though with different circumstances around reunions. In Korea, carefully arranged reunion events allowed divided families to meet briefly after 60 years of separation, with elderly participants in their 80s having highly emotional encounters. These reunions were rare and required complex negotiations between North and South Korea. In Germany's case, families were separated by the Berlin Wall where over 80 people were killed trying to cross, but reunions became possible when Hungary opened its borders in 1989, allowing East Germans to travel to West Germany through that route. This eventually led to the fall of the Berlin Wall and free movement between East and West Germany, unlike the Korean situation where families remain separated except for rare organized reunions.	"['Families divided by Korean War share private moments as reunion event continues\nAround 80 elderly South Koreans met privately Friday with North Korean relatives they haven’t seen for 60 years, on the second day of a highly-charged reunion for families divided by the Korean War.\nIn contrast to the previous day when their tearful and, in some cases, clearly traumatic meetings were played out in front of TV cameras, they were allowed three hours in their own rooms to try and bridge the decades of separation.\nThe event, held at a mountain resort in North Korea, was only secured after intense North-South negotiations, and has been seen by many as a possible first step towards improved inter-Korean cooperation.\nIt is the first such reunion for more than three years, and followed a rare concession from North Korea, which had originally threatened to cancel if the South and the United States pushed ahead with annual joint military drills that begin on Monday.\nNorth Korea’s main ally China, which has come under increased U.S. pressure to push Pyongyang into abandoning its nuclear weapons programme, welcomed the reunion as a moment of “great significance”.\n“We believe this is an important and correct step forward taken … with national interests and regional peace and stability in mind,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in Beijing.\nIn an apparent goodwill gesture, Seoul approved Friday the shipment by two private aid groups for close to $1.0 million worth of tuberculosis medicine and powdered milk to North Korea.\nThe 82 South Korean participants, with an average age of 84 and some so frail they had to be moved by ambulance, arrived at the resort midday Thursday after crossing the heavily-militarised border in a convoy of 10 buses.\nAfter a brief lunch, they were led into a banqueting hall where they first came face-to-face with the 180 North Korean relatives they had applied to see.\nSome simply embraced and sobbed, while others stared and stroked each other’s faces, seemingly unable to believe that they were in the same room.\nPhotos were exchanged and lovingly pored over, not just old black-and-white ones of the family when it was together, but also brand new colour pictures of husbands, wives, children and grandchildren that neither side knew even existed.\nOne of the oldest South Koreans, a 93-year-old man who was separated from his pregnant wife during the 1950-53 conflict, met the now 64-year-old son he had never seen.\n“So old,” were his first words as they came face-to-face — the resemblance strikingly clear to people watching.\n“Let me hug you,” the father said and then, sobbing, they both embraced.\nThe North Korean women wore traditional hanbok dresses, while the men were mostly dressed in dark suits. All seemed to be sporting badges of former leaders Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il — obligatory accessories in North Korea.\n– Clock running out –\nTens of millions of people were displaced by the sweep of the 1950-53 Korean War, which saw the frontline yo-yo from the south of the Korean peninsula to the northern border with China and back again.\nThe chaos and devastation separated brothers and sisters, parents and children, husbands and wives.\nBecause the conflict concluded with an armistice rather than a peace treaty, the two Koreas technically remain at war and direct exchanges of letters or telephone calls are prohibited.\nThe reunion programme began in earnest after a historic North-South summit in 2000, but the numbers clamouring for a chance to participate have always far outstripped those actually selected.\nFor many people, time simply ran out. Last year alone, 3,800 South Korean applicants for reunions died.\nOf the 82 South Koreans attending the current reunion, 14 needed wheelchairs and two were forced to return home a day early for health reasons.\nFriday’s private gatherings will be followed by another mass, open reunion in the afternoon.\nThen on Saturday, comes probably the most traumatic moment of all: a farewell ceremony that both sides understand — given their advanced ages — marks the last time they will ever see each other.\n[Image via Agence France-Presse]', 'the Cold War\nTable O\' Contents\nGeneral Overview of the Cold War\nMarshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine\nBerlin Crisis and the Berlin Airlift\nBetween the Superpowers Rises\nA General Overview of the Cold War\nThe Cold War was an ideological war between the two\nworld superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, beginning after\nWorld War Two. After the war, Germany was left defeated, and Britain\nand France were left drained and exhausted. The United States and\nthe Soviet Union, though also drained, held considerable power, and both\nsoon rose to superpower status. The two became rivals through ""conflicting\nideologies and mutual distrust""1, and constantly competed for\nThe Soviet Union wanted to spread Communism in Eastern\nEurope and create a ""buffer zone"" of friendly governments as defense against\nGermany. In 1946, with Eastern Europe under Soviet control and influence,\nEurope was divided into a West (western democracies and the United States)\nbloc and East (Soviet Union and Soviet occupied territory) bloc.\nAn ""iron curtain"" separated Europe.\nThe aftereffects of World War Two were what shaped Cold\nWar Germany. The post-war state of Germany was grim: about 1/4 of\nhousing had been destroyed, the economic infrastructure had largely collapsed,\ninflation was rampant, there was a shortage of food, and millions of homeless\nGermans from the east were returning. After its unconditional surrender,\nGermany was divided into four zones of Allied military occupation: American,\nFrench, British, and Soviet. The old capital of Berlin was also divided\ninto four zones, but Berlin itself remained inside of the Soviet zone.\nIn 1949, the French, British, and American zones merged and formed the\nFederal Republic of Germany (Bundesrepublic Deutschland), with its capital\ncity Bonn. Also in 1949, the Soviet zone became the German Democratic\nRepublic (Deutsche Demokratische Republik) with the Soviet sector of Berlin\nas the capital.\nWest Germany became a suprisingly stable western\ndemocracy. A new policy required a 5% vote for a political party\nto be represented in the Bundestag (the upper legislative house), in order\nto prevent any small extremist parties from gaining representation too\neasily. This was what brought the downfall of the Weimar Republic\nand the rise of the Nazi Party, after all.\nEast Germany was established as a Stalin-style Socialist\nstate. It became a member of the Warsaw Pact and came to have one\nof the most advanced economies and standard of living of the Soviet-bloc\nstates (though that\'s not saying much, as it still lagged behind West Germany).\nThe East German government was formed into a centralized and dictatorial\nregime. The State Security Police (Stasi) maintained the Soviet expectation\nof the people. Free speech and opinions against the regime were not\ntolerated, and artistic and intellectual programs were strongly controlled.\nThe partition and division of Germany drove a block\nin between both United States to Russia relations and West German to East\nGerman relations. The Allies were at the same time trying to be forgiving\nto the Germans for World War Two while also insuring that the Germans could\nnever again begin the expansionism that had led to the two previous wars.\nDuring the Cold War, Germany became the center for\nall the tensions between Democracy and Communism. The location of\nGermany as the gateway between East and West Europe made it the ideal place\nfor these political struggles to occur. When Russia had tried to\nexpand in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, they were\nchecked by the rising power of the German state. Therefore, after\nGermany fell in World War Two, Russia attempted to begin its expansion\nacross a now weakened Europe.\nThe end of World War Two left Russia in possession\nof all of Germany up to 300 miles west of Berlin. This new annexation\ncaused the powers in Europe to become unbalanced and Russia replaced Germany\nas the country that was getting too big. Contrary to their actions against\nrising powers in the past, England did not try to stop the Russian expansion.\nThey did this because they thought it preferable to give Russia parts of\nGermany over giving them other territories that would allow Russia access\nto the Mediterranean.\nThe Allies had many reasons for partitioning Germany.\nOverall, the purpose of dividing land up was to control Germany until a\nnew government could be instated. France, America, England and Russia\nall had parts of Germany that were put temporarily under their control.\nWhile the Allies were still in occupation of the country, decisions were\nmade by a council of the four powers. The representatives were then\nresponsible for carrying out the decisions of the council in their allotted\nterritory. There was a catch that the Russians exploited to thwart\nthe other powers. According to the treaty, proposals to the council\nwere only put into effect if there was a unanimous vote. The Russians\ncould use this just like they used the U.N. Security Council. The\nRussians had annoyed the other powers by using their veto power in the\nSecurity Council to veto every proposition that came before them.\nBy exercising their right to arbitrarily veto any decision made regarding\nGermany, they could prevent any actions that were against their best interest.\nThe Soviets then would be able to run Eastern Germany as they wished, because\nno proposition stopping them from doing so could be passed.\nThe Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine\nIn June 1947, the Marshall Plan was put into effect\nin order to stop the Russians from influencing any of the weakened western\npowers. During the time the United States sent massive economic aid\nto Europe democracies to help rebuild. Billions of dollars were spent\nto help countries recover quickly and to reduce the influence of Communism.\nThis plan helped to restore West Germany and rebuild it as a new ally in\nAmerica\'s fight against Russia. Russia refused the aid of the Marshall\nPlan and, as a result, East Germany was not completely rebuilt. This\nlack of reconstruction showed through even after the reunification. The\nGerman economy after reunification took a big hit, because it had to pay\nfor all the reconstruction that the Communists never did.\nThe Truman Doctrine, a plan to help states going\nthrough a struggle for freedom against their oppressors, was instituted\nin 1948. President Truman said, ""I believe it must be the policy\nof the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted\nsubjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures."" The Truman\nDoctrine instituted a policy of containment; Communism would be limited\nonly to areas already under Soviet control, and Americans would resist\nSoviet expansion everywhere else.\nThe Truman Doctrine could not have been more clearly\ndirected towards East Germany and, technically, West Germany. Germany\nwas both under subjugation by an outside force and also under the power\nof the armed minority that the Russians would soon put into power in the\nform of the DDR (Deutsches Demokratische Republik). In 1949 the Allies\nmade good on what they promised in the Truman Doctrine and unified West\nGermany into the BDR (Federal Republic of Germany). At the same time\nthe Russians instituted the DDR, which turned out to be more of a regime\nthan a government.\nThe Berlin Crisis and the Berlin Airlift\nDue to horrible conditions in East Germany, its citizens\nhad begun to cross over to West Germany and were allowed to proclaim themselves\nrefugees. 2.6 million out of 17.5 million residents of East Germany\nhad crossed over by 1961. This caused labor shortages in East Germany\nand also the further degradation of an already failing East German economy.\nAs East Germany got worse and worse, Russia became willing to take offensive\nmeasures to reclaim West Berlin.\nIn December of 1947, Russia and the United States\nfinally parted ways and the Western Powers began to meet about German business\nwithout the Russian ambassador present. On March 20, 1948, Russia\ndeclared that the Allied Control Council of Berlin no longer existed and\nvoluntarily withdrew from all of their meetings. As a result, there\nwere no government relations existing between Russia and the other Allies.\nThe problems worsened when the Russians decided\nthat they wanted all of Berlin under their control. There had been\nno previous treaties giving the Allies free access to West Berlin through\nRussian territory, so Russia exploited this situation and isolated Berlin\nfrom American soldiers and supplies. The Berlin Blockade began in\nmid 1948 as Russian forces surrounded West Berlin in an effort to make\nAllied soldiers there surrender from starvation. The Soviets sealed\noff railroads and highways to the Western sector of Berlin, effectively\ncutting it off from the Western Allied sector of Germany. In response\nto this, the Allies instituted the Berlin Airlift on June 21, 1948, in\norder to provide West Berlin with food and fuel. Cargo planes dropped\nfood, fuel, and other supplies into West Germany 24 hours a day.\nRussia rationalized the blockade by saying that\nthey were doing extensive roadwork (this didn\'t fool anyone). Russia\nthen went on to claim that Berlin was rightfully theirs and that the Western\npowers had control only of West Berlin because they had more votes when\nthe partition was being made. Marshall answered this by declaring\nto the Russian government that all Allies had a right to be in Berlin and\nthat the United States intended to stay. He then went on to\ncut off all passage of trains between East and West Germany.\nThe conflict intensified when America secretly moved\n60 long-range bombers into the British Isles. Russia saw that the\nAllies did not intend to surrender so they offered the citizens of West\nBerlin food on the condition that they came over to the Russian side.\nThe West Berliners decided that they would rather starve than be under\nRussian authority. In May, 1949, Russia called off the failed blockade.\nThey lost this confrontation for two reasons. First, the Russians\nhad not yet acquired nuclear capabilities and therefore could not stage\na larger offensive. Second, the Russians were in an extremely bad\nposition in regard to foreign relations; ""...before the eyes of the world,\nit appeared to be trying to starve over 2 million men, women, and children\nin West Berlin. While the Berlin Airlift continuing month after month\nprovided a tangible demonstration of western determination and competence.""2\nSo basically, through this whole conflict, Russia was making themselves\nlook like murderers and the Allies looked like saviors. The Western\npowers\' unflinching support of Berlin gave other parts of Germany more\nconfidence in their commitment to Germany\'s well-being.\nWest Germany began their first big step toward making\namends with France in March of 1950. They made a peace treaty with\nthe French that ended the conflict that had been going on since the early\n1800s. The peace treaty was a step toward assuring the Allies that\nthere was no possibility of German expansion and the outbreak of another\nwar, the only things the Allies required to guarantee Germany its autonomy.\nOn May 9, 1950, France and Germany made a treaty that gave joint control\nof the steel and coal industry in Germany and France making it ""not merely\nunthinkable, but materially impossible""3 to have a war between\nthe two countries. This treaty was called the Schuman Plan and was\na large step toward France\'s approval of West Germany\'s autonomy.\nSoon after, the European Coal and Steel Community was established consisting\nof six European powers. As a result of these actions, West Germany\nbecame accepted again in European affairs.\nAt about the same time as the treaty (May 1950),\nthe Korean War broke out, and Europe tensed for a Russian invasion into\nthe West. West Germany was allowed to contribute soldiers under the\npower of NATO. This showed that some of the Allies were beginning\nto trust the Germans again. The only obstacle was France, who greatly\nopposed any German army, even under the authority of NATO. They thought\nif German got an army of any kind, they would immediately make an alliance\nwith Russia and attack the French. On May 26, 1952, the occupation\nof West German was officially over according to the treaty, and West Germany\nwas supposed to have its own government. The Allies would not let\ngo of the country until they were absolutely sure that Germany would not\nreturn as a threat. On May 27, 1952, a defensive treaty against Russia\ncalled the European Defense Treaty was proposed between France, Italy,\nHolland, Germany, Luxembourg, and Belgium. This was to create an\narmy that was composed of all these countries under the command of NATO.\nThe French Assembly rejected this treaty for fear of the German army, and\nas a result, attempts to unify West Germany under its own authority were\nvery temporarily dropped. The English, on October 3, 1952, made the\nlast step that France needed to be assured that Germany was not a threat\nby declaring that they would maintain a military presence on mainland Europe.\nThis gave France the security they wanted against a German invasion.\nFrance then consisted to end the occupation of West Germany and to admit\nit into the 1948 Brussels Treaty. West Germany was now a wholly independent\nstate except for West Berlin.\nTension Between the Superpowers Rises\nDuring the time elapsed between the first blockade and\n1958, Russia had developed nuclear capabilities and they were ready to\ngo after West Berlin again. In 1958, East Germany began to again\nblock immigration to West Germany by establishing barbed wire fences and\npatrols along the whole border between East and West Germany. Berlin\nwas the only spot open to immigration between the two countries.\nAt the time of Russia\'s second offensive, the Western powers had 11,000\ntroops in Berlin compared to the 550,000 that Russia had. The Russians\nrestricted access to West Berlin, except through two routes. The\nfirst route consisted of heavily guarded roads where Russian soldiers harassed\ntravelers. The second consisted of three airlines; Russian fighter\nplanes ""buzzed"" flights. Basically, these tactics were adopted to\ndemonstrate to the Allies that they were helpless to stop any Russian movement.\nRussia at that time had the technology to prevent another airlift, so the\nAllies had no option of peacefully supplying West Berlin with food.\n""We are certainly not going to fight a ground war in Europe.\nWhat good would it do to send a few more thousand or indeed a few divisions\ninto Europe with something like 175 Soviet divisions in the area?"" -President\nRussia intensified the conflict when it declared\nit would hand over all power in East Berlin to the DDR regime effective\non May 27, 1952. The Allies had no alliances with the DDR in terms\nof established passages into Berlin, and so the Allies had no way to hold\nBerlin, but still refused to let it go. Russia and the Allies entered\na stalemate. But, as May 27 got closer, Russia began to look for\na way to back down and get out of the situation. Russia launched\na flurry of new deadlines. On March 5, they declared that they were\nwilling to delay the transition of power to the DDR. On March 9,\nthey declared that they wanted to have all countries involved in the conflict\nwithdraw their troops. They finally backed down completely on March\n11, when they declared that they would allow free access to West Berlin\nfor all travelers. And so, again, the Communists lost the cosmic\ngame of chicken.\nThe Berlin Wall\nIn 1961, Berlin, the last place through which immigrants\ncould leave East Germany, was blocked off by the ""infamous"" Berlin Wall,\nat which more than 80 persons were shot while trying to escape East Germany\non non-consecutive occasions. This state of affairs continued until\nthe the summer of 1989, when the reforming Hungarian government opened\nHungary\'s borders and allowed passage of East Germans through that country.\nFrom Hungary, East Germans could go directly into West Germany. The\nBerlin Wall was then rendered useless (except to keep the neighbors\' dog\nout, and even it could go through Hungary). By November 9, 1989,\nthe people had begun to openly destroy the Wall and so Russia decided to\ntake it down, allowing free immigration between the countries and also\ninstigating the first of the movements to unify Germany.\nDuring the Cold War, Germany became the\ncenter for the conflict between Communism and Democracy. Germany\nwas the site where all the tensions between the two ideals was played out.\nBecause of its location as the farthest western city to the east, Berlin\nwas torn in half by the struggling parties. The repercussions of\nthis are what is shaping the problems in modern day Germany. The\nneglect that East Germany suffered through at the hands of the Communists\nwould cause not only economic problems but also social problems as the\nWestern and Eastern Germans grew apart as a people. The scars that\nthe Communist Party left on the East Germans are still being repaired.\nThe reconstruction of East Germany would almost bankrupt the West.\nNot only had much of East Germany not been rebuilt, most of what was produced\nhad been shipped back to the Soviet Union as ""war reparations"".\nDivided Germany had also caused a social split to\noccur between the Eastern and Western Germans. The Western German\'s\nlives had greatly improved since the end of World War Two but the Eastern\nGerman\'s lives were still mired in the destruction wrought by the war that\ncould not be fixed under the Communist regime. These differences\ncaused East Germans to view their western relatives as pampered and privileged.\nThese social end economic issues are still being repaired in Germany and\nthe end of the social schism does not appear yet to be in sight.\n1.

['I have actually remained in the field of Custom-made Plastic Shot Molding for regarding 21 years now as of the writing of this short article. I am currently working as a Process Designer, which I have actually provided for around 15 of my 20+ years in the field of injection molding and also I have largely worked for molders that were associated with the automotive field.\nPlastic shot molding, necessarily, is the procedure of infusing plastic into a mold (or mould in European circles), cooling down the plastic, expeling it from the mold, as well as packing the finished product for sale to the customer. This appears easy and in it’s basic kind it is, however the process included with making all this take place is really quite complex. Plastic can be injected right into the mold and mildew with low stress, however generally is done under high stress upwards of 30,000 PSI cavity stress.\nThere are numerous varied sorts of shot molding and also as several kinds of plastic injection molding makers to select it. Some of the a lot more typical sorts of plastic molding are standard mold and mildew injection, insert molding, plastic extrusion, impact molding, multi-color or worldly molding, stack molding, and also rotating molding just among others. There are custom-made plastics also, from usual everyday plastic resins to the a lot more unique design grade resins made use of in the majority of cars today. There are even shot molding grade “steels” being experimented with as well as made use of nowadays.\nThere are numerous kinds of injection molding devices all created particular objectives. There are the typical horizontal shot molding machines which range in dimension from a couple of tons completely as much as 9000 heaps and also even more. You could drive automobile in between the platens of a press that large. Upright shot molding machines are typically used for insert molding (although this can additionally be done horizontally) and share a typical cover with two ejection halves of the mold and mildew. This enables de-molding and also loading of inserts in one half, while the various other half is producing the following shot of components. There are likewise 2 and 3 fired injection molding devices for producing multi-color or multi-material parts such as lenses for tail lights and also equipment shift knobs with difficult plastic internal core and a soft vinyl out covering. The newest makers are “all aoki isbm electrical variations” which stray from the conventional hydraulic injection devices utilized currently for years. These shot molding devices are far more reliable and also repeatable after that their hydraulic cousins are.

16	I'm planning to transport my boat - which parts are more important to check for safety: the parts that secure the boat to the trailer or the guides that help with alignment during loading?	Both components serve different critical safety functions. The securing elements (tie-down straps, winch line, safety chains, and proper hitch/coupler match) are essential for safe transportation and preventing loss of the boat during travel. These should never be compromised - the winch alone should not be trusted, and tie-down straps must always be used as extra safety precautions. Meanwhile, the guide components (like wooden guides attached to outer skids) are primarily for ease of loading but only experience relatively small forces. These guides are attached with simple brass wood screws at 30 cm centers since they only protrude about 4 cm above the skids and make minimal contact with the hull's curved bottom edge.	['An Alternative Design of Boat Guide\nIf you have a Beaver you may have experienced the problem of the boat slipping off to one side during recovery on certain steeper slipways. The problem is caused by the increased angle between the boat and the trailer preventing the rear of the central keel of the hull engaging between the two centre skids until the boat is a significant way on to the trailer. Any sideways gradient on the slipway or trailer causes the boat to slip to one side.\nBill Perry and Dave Smith have previously given details of additions they have made to their trailers to prevent this problem. This article details an alternative method of achieving the same effect.\n(Click on any photograph to enlarge it)\nThe design consists of two pieces of timber, planed to the appropriate shape and then screwed to the outside of the two outer skids. These produce a channel to guide the boat, preventing it slipping to one side as it is recovered.\nThe pieces of timber only protrude about 4 cm above the skids and so only make contact with the curved bottom edge of the hull. They can be greased with lard along with the skids to reduce friction.\nThis design will obviously only work if the boat hull does not overlap the outer edge of the skids on your trailer by more than a few cm although a packing piece of timber could be used to increase the width if necessary. The timbers have to be planed to fit the contours of the boat hull so this must be done whilst the boat is on the trailer so that the timber can be repeatedly offered up to check the angle is appropriate, mine is about 60 degrees.\nThe smaller timber attached to the guide timber visible in the photos is not part of the design, it is there for a different purpose.\nThe guide timbers on my trailer extend from the end of the skid to rear of the wheel arch, although they could extend further. The angle the timber is planed to must be measured close to the wheel arch and must extend along the full length even though, due to the shape of the hull, the gap increases as it gets nearer to the bow. Obviously the gap must be wide enough for the widest part of the hull to pass through as the boat is slipped on and off.\nBecause the guide timbers only allow the boat to move sideways a few millimetres, they are subject to relatively small forces. Also because they only protrude a little above the skid they are attached to, the method of fixing does not have to be substantial. Mine are simply screwed to the skid using seven 3 inch brass wood screws at 30 cm centres. This also has the advantage that nothing protrudes on the inner edge of the skids.\nThe smaller pieces of timber are attached with a single screw close to the end of the skid. They can be turned through 180 degrees so that they protrude beyond the skids. The idea behind them is that on the occasions where the slipway is not enclosed, they can be used to trap the boat , stopping it moving sideways before it is winched on to the trailer. I have not had the need to try them out yet, so they may not work.\nWhilst the design of the two smaller pieces of timber is untried, the boat guides themselves have been in use for the last three years and have worked well. They are simple and cheap to make, mine were made from a length of 8 cm x 4 cm timber rescued from the canal. Because they only make contact with the bottom edges of the hull they cannot catch on rubbing strips or corner fenders and they cannot scratch or damage paintwork or the hull. They do leave a little lard on the bottom edge of the hull sides but once afloat this can not be seen.\nIf you are fortunate enough to have one of the brand new Beavers then you should not suffer from the problem described at all. Ian Graham cleverly extended the central keel on the new hulls so that it will engage much sooner than previously.', 'Press the play button (▶) above to start the video.\nTranscript for Trailering and Launching\nRob: Oh, hey! Thanks for helping us check our rig before we hit the road. Have you ever trailered before?\nThe person behind the camera shakes his head no.\nRob: Well, let’s start from the beginning.\nChoosing Your Trailer\nHaley: First, we make sure our load weight and size are matched between our boat, trailer, hitch, and vehicle. Everything matches up, including the ball hitch and the trailer coupler. Now, if you’ve ever seen a boat trailer in a ditch, a mismatched ball hitch and coupler may have been the cause. Which is why we also crisscross and attach the safety chains, so we can see that it’s secure.\nHaley: One thing we can’t see is the weight on the tongue, which is also really important to consider. A portion of the loaded trailer’s weight pushes down on the towing hitch. That’s called the tongue weight. This weight helps us tow without fishtailing or having problems steering our vehicle.\nKary-Ann: Now it’s time to get this rig properly loaded before we head out on the road.\nBefore Hitting the Road\nHaley: We don’t want to lose our boat, so we check and secure the tie-down straps. We never trust the winch alone to secure the boat. We always use the tie-down straps as extra safety precautions. Make sure the hitch pin is in place, double-check the trailer brake lights and turn signals, check your tire pressure and lug nuts, and, finally, if your boat has an outboard engine, be sure it’s up and secured.\nHaley: And when we’re on the road, we have to make wider turns because of the extra length of the trailer, and allow extra time and distance for stopping and passing vehicles.\nKary-Ann: All right. You disconnect the trailer lights. I’ll go undo the straps, and we will start to launch.\nRob: All right.\nLaunching Your Boat\nThe person behind the camera starts to disconnect the winch line.\nKary-Ann: Whoa partner, not that one! The winch line stays attached until just before we back the boat off the trailer. Is there anything else we’re forgetting?\nThe person behind the camera hands Kary-Ann a drain plug.\nKary-Ann: Oh yeah! You don’t want to forget this little thing.\nHaley: You’d be surprised how much water can flow into a launched boat before someone realises they forgot to put in their drain plug. So do yourself a favour, and make sure yours is properly in place.\nKary-Ann: All right. The trailer lights are disconnected. The tie-down straps are undone. The drain plug is in place. The winch is still secure. There’s a rope tied to the bow. Halie’s going to drive. You are going to help with directions. And we are going to go through the rest of the launching procedure.\nHaley: With our life jackets on, we back the trailer far enough into the water that the boat is floating. We set the vehicle’s parking brake. The engine is lowered, started, and warmed up. The winch line is undone, and the boat is in reverse.\nKary-Ann: And there you have it. We’re launched.\nHaley: And after a day on the lake, we’ll need to retrieve our boat.\nRetrieving Your Boat\nHaley: Retrieving your boat is mostly the same deal as launching, just in reverse. Back the trailer in until 2/3 of the rollers, or bunks, are submerged. We put the vehicle in park and set the parking brake as an extra precaution. After that, the boat operator can drive the boat onto the trailer. And being a hotshot and trying to load your boat with engine power is a bad move. It does two things that can wreck the launch site for everyone. First, the prop can dig a hole behind the ramp where the trailers can get stuck.\nHaley: And then, the mounded sand can get boats stuck. So, instead, once we position the boat on the trailer far enough to attach the winch line, we crank the rest of the way. There’s a lot of tension there, so stay out of the direct line of the winch cable in case something happens. Then, we shut off and raise the engine and ease it out.\nKary-Ann: Remember, a little courtesy goes a long way at the boat ramp.\nHaley: Knowing whose turn it is to load is decided by the vehicles and their trailers, not where the boats are in the water. After you drop the vehicle driver onto land, wait offshore clear of the ramp and dock until your partner arrives with the vehicle and trailer. After we retrieve our boat, we always pull the car and boat off to the side, so we don’t block the ramp.\nHaley: Heading home is pretty much the same deal as before—gear and strap secured, check the hitch lock pin, lights and chains, and finally, we pull the drain plug and remove any aquatic hitchhikers from the boat and trailer. We don’t want to spread a nuisance.\nKary-Ann: Awesome day out on the lake. Let’s head back home.']	['<urn:uuid:dd6f5ad8-244a-4f1a-935e-315d3e00488e>', '<urn:uuid:07522345-6caf-409e-a1a6-deff705197e0>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	34	113	1577
17	I'm developing new packaging solutions and need to understand both the structural aspects of different bag types and the material considerations when using biodegradable polymers. What are the available bag style options, and how do the properties of biodegradable materials affect their implementation?	There are several bag styles available: pillow bags (two flat panels with vertical back seal), doypacks (stand-up pouches with oval base), quad seal bags (rectangular bottom with four vertical seals), flat bottom bags (similar to quad seal but with single vertical seal), gusseted bags (pillow bags with side gussets), three-side seal bags, sachets (small 4-side sealed packets), and stick packs (narrow pillow bags). However, when implementing these styles with biodegradable materials like Ecoflex and Ecovio, there are important material considerations. These biodegradable polymers have poor melt strength and melt-curtain stability, which affects production. They require specific processing conditions and equipment modifications, including proper bubble support systems, long A-frames for bubble collapsing, and careful attention to winding processes. While these materials can replace polyethylene and polystyrene, their physical property constraints must be carefully managed during production.	"[""Packaging machine manufacturers need to know very specific details of your project in order to provide the most accurate recommendations and pricing.\nQuestions that need answers before proceed with the quote request:\n1. Do you use premade pouches or rollstock fim?\nA flexible packaging machine can either form your bags from a large roll of plastic film (called rollstock) or it can fill and seal bags that are already made. Rollstock film is large spool of flat plastic packaging film wrapped round a hollow core. Premade bags are prefabricated by a film supplier, meaning they arrive at your facility already formed into a bag shape. A packaging machine then fills and seals these bags.\n2. What are your bags styles?\n1. Pillow bags are the most widely-used and economical packaging format, comprised of two flat panels sealed together on the top and bottom with a vertical seal down the back.\n2. Doypacks are stand-up pouches with an oval-shaped base. This premium bag type is becoming increasingly popular for specialty food products.\n3. Quad seal bags have a rectangular bottom and can stand unassisted. This bag type has two side gussets and two panels joined together with four vertical seals, providing a more structured bag and modular look.\n4. Flat bottom bags are similar to quad seal bags, featuring two gussets, but only have a single vertical seal.\n5. Gusseted bags are similar to pillow bags but have side gussets, offering more internal space.\n6. Three sides seal bags are flat pouches sealed on three sides.\n7. Sachets are small, flat 4-side sealed packets. Think small single-serving packets of sugar and ketchup.\n8. Stick Packs are very narrow pillow bags, used things like single-serve drink mixes.\n3. Do you have any packaging speed requirements?\nSpeeds are usually given in bags per minute (bpm). This number represents how many finished bags the machine can complete per minute. The packaging machine speeds achievable for your particular project will depend heavily on your product and its properties, your plant environment, your bag type, and the skill of equipment operators.\n4. What are your bags specifications?\nKnowing the exact specifications of your bag or bags is vitally important to spec the appropriate packaging machine. Here's the information your OEM will ask for:\na. Package dimensions. For flat bags, width and length are all that's necessary. For bags that have gussets or stand up, width, length, and depth are required.\nb. Package weights or volumes. For solids and powder products, how heavy is your filled package? For liquids, what is the volume of the filled package?\n5. What are your product specifications?\nA packaging system must be also tailored to the specifications of your product.\na. Solids: What is the average piece size (dimensions) and weight? Is the product sticky, dry, fresh, or frozen?\nb. Liquids: What is its viscosity?\nc. Powders: What is its bulk density? Does the product flow freely?\nd. Filling temperature: When your product is filled into bags, will it be hot, frozen, or room temperature? (Expressed in degrees C or F)"", 'PEs vs Biodegradable Polymers – Processing Challenges and Constraints\nBiodegradable resins have been gaining popularity since they came into the market some 10 years ago. Why? Because biopolymers are seen as sustainable alternatives to standard plastics that are heavily dependent on fossil fuels.\nSeveral biodegradable polymers – both from renewable and non-renewable sources – are available today. These biodegradable polymers are compostable in compliance with European, US and Japanese standards for compostable and biodegradable polymers, and their use can help enhance brand positioning and eco-friendly messaging for companies that want a competitive edge when it comes to sustainability.\nAmong the biodegradable resins available, the most popular appears under the brand names Ecoflex and Ecovio, manufactured by BASF. Ecoflex is a completely biodegradable aliphatic-aromatic polyester which is still derived out of petroleum-based materials. But when it’s used in combination with renewable raw materials or by blending it with bio-based polymers like starch or poly (lactic acid), biodegradable plastics with new and interesting property profiles are obtained.\nEcovio is a biodegradable resin that contains up to 45 percent renewable resources; in essence, it is a compound of biodegradable copolyester Ecoflex and polylactic acid (PLA). Ecoflex and Ecovio in combination are touted as a direct replacement for polyethylene and polystyrene in wide variety of applications.\nEven though biodegradable resins are gaining in prominence and finding acceptance among wide-spectrum consumers and converters, there are still some challenges to overcome in order to displace petroleum-based resins like polyethylene in most common packaging applications.\nOne of the biggest challenges facing biodegradable polymers are overcoming physical property constraints like poor melt strength, melt-curtain stability and barrier properties, especially moisture barrier. Process ability is another factor that needs to be closely examined. Factors like higher cost of biodegradable resins and availability are not considered for this article.\nEcoflex and Ecovio blends can be processed on a blown-film line designed to run polyethylene; however they are not completely interchangeable. A combination of significantly higher density and lower processing temperature compared to LDPE and poor melt strength, makes Ecoflex a challenging material to process on best of blown film lines.\nLet’s look at various components on a blown film line that may play a significant role in successful processing of these biodegradable polymers for any flexible packaging application.\nExtruder and Feed Screw\nA barrier type screw with a mixture in is ideal for processing. A grooved feed extruder works well in blowing of low melt strength materials but is not a must. Care must be taken to maintain grooved feed section of the extruder at as cold a temperature as possible. A tighter screen pack ensures adequate back pressure and uniform melt flow of viscous material.\nIt is critical to maintain melt temperature in the range of 160 to 1900ºC, so all temperature zones on the extruder and die should be set to achieve desired melt temperature. A flat or a slight ascending profile works best for most applications.\nGravimetric Blending and Extrusion Control\nBoth gravimetric batch and continuous feed blending with yield control work well; however, care must be taken to ensure there are no fluctuations in screw RPM as a result of material surging in the extruder.\nSpecific output is significantly higher for these polymers compared to PE blends. As a result careful consideration must be given to ensure adequate balance of throughput, screw RPMs and motor load.\nAir Ring – IBC – Cooling\nHigher air temperature and minimum IBC supply helps stabilize the bubble. Due to the high elasticity of the material, it is very important to support the bubble by lowering the primary cage just above the die, and use a secondary cage to further support the bubble mid-way to the primary nip.\nBubble Collapsing and Haul-Off\nLong A-frame and long side guides are ideal in locking and supporting the bubble as it is being collapsed. Bubble cage and collapsers play a critical part in eliminating wrinkle formation in this key area. Plastic covered slats or coated rollers work equally well in collapsing the bubble as long there is no uneven wear or flat spots which can cause unnecessary drag, causing wrinkles and bagginess in the film.\nBoth horizontal and vertical haul-off work well as gauge randomizer. A properly maintained turning bar with adequate air flow for cushioning the film along clean and rubber rollers help the film along to downstream equipment.\nBow rollers, spreader rollers, stretch rollers and spiral groove-rollers all help eliminate wrinkles formed in machine direction, as a result of process instability due to poor extrusion or misaligned components.\nA very important part of any film production process is the collection of film on a paper core. If everything in the process is set up right and monitored, then a center winder with a lay-on roll and taper tension is adequate to wind rolls to optimum hardness.\nTransitioning In and Out of Biodegradable Polymers\nTransitioning in and out of a production run is just as important as an actual production. Following proper procedure eliminates cross contamination, degradation and, in rare cases, cross link of polymer. A thorough attention to the process will save both time and expensive clean up.

When fed soft food, ferrets develop a more distant hard palate plane from the cranial base, more proclined canines, smaller interfrontal and interparietal widths, and a slenderer zygomatic arch. Their coronoid process also becomes shorter and narrower. These effects are likely related to the reduced masticatory muscle function from eating soft food.

DESIGN: Sixteen ferret kits (eight male and eight female) were selected for the present investigation. Serial lateral and dorsoventral cephalograms were taken on each animal at a mean age of 25, 35, 55, 80 and 300 days. The cephalograms were then digitised and the coordinates of 33 landmarks were derived on each set of cephalograms. Thirty-four variables were then calculated on each set of cephalograms by computer image programs with the coordinate data. Results were analysed statistically, and the craniofacial growth pattern and related sexual dimorphism were described in three perspectives: lateral and dorsoventral viscero- and neurocranium, and lateral mandible. FINDINGS: In both sexes, the viscero- and neurocranium follow an orderly pattern of expansive growth in three dimensions. The growth of the mandible is mainly characterised by an anteroposterior elongation of the mandibular body, an enlargement of the coronoid process, and an increase in height of the alveolar process. The growth rate varies with site. Craniofacial growth in ferrets starts to slow down and finally ceases earlier in female than in male animals.\nDescriptors: ferrets, craniofacial growth, maxillofacial development, physiology, skull growth and development, cephalometry, mandible growth, sex factors, skull radiography.\nHe, T. and S.

ISSN: 0909-8836.\nAbstract: Studying the effects of masticatory muscle function on craniofacial morphology in animal models with different masticatory systems is important for further understanding of related issues in humans. Forty 5-wk-old male ferrets were equally divided into two groups. One group was fed a diet of hard pellets (HDG) and the other group was fed the same diet but softened with water (SDG). Lateral and dorsoventral cephalograms were taken on each group after 6 months. Cephalometric measurements were performed by digital procedures. For SDG ferrets, the hard palate plane was more distant from the cranial base plane, and canines were more proclined compared with HDG ferrets. The SDG ferrets were also found to have smaller interfrontal and interparietal widths, and a slenderer zygomatic arch than the HDG ferrets. In the mandible, the coronoid process was generally shorter and narrower for the SDG ferrets. The effects of the altered masticatory muscle function on craniofacial morphology in growing ferrets seemed to differ from those previously reported in other animal models studied under similar experimental conditions. Such differences in the effects are presumably related to the differences in the mode of mastication, craniofacial anatomy and growth pattern in different animal models.\nDescriptors: ferret growth and development, mastication, masticatory muscles, maxillofacial development, skull growth and development, feed, nutrition, facial bones, mandible.\nHoefer, H.L.

19	what treaties did tall mandan sign	Tall Mandan, who was a chief and medicine man, was a signatory to both the 1851 and 1868 Fort Laramie Treaties. He signed the 1868 treaty with the word 'akicita' after his name, which means warrior or enforcer, indicating his responsibility to ensure the treaties were carried out honorably according to Lakota interpretation.	['Sitting alongside his family in ceremonies, Wakinyan LaPointe has heard the warnings for as long as he can remember. Lately, the dire messages have become increasingly urgent: Water must be preserved and protected. Unless that is done, all life on Earth is in danger.\n“Everything we are – our languages, our ways of life, our ceremonies, are all dependent on water,” says the 26-year-old Sicangu Lakota. “Without water there is no life.”\nWakinyan and his brother Thorne, 25, are college students and community organizers. They have been instrumental for years in Minnesota-based water events such as the Healthy Nations river scouting expeditions, Mde Maka Ska Canoe Nations Gathering, the Four Directions Water Walk, and Mde Maka Ska Community Conversations.\nBut after the recent death of an Indigenous rights leader in Honduras, the two men felt a greater sense of urgency to act on behalf of water, and the world’s Indigenous populations.\nBerta Caceres, who had successfully pressured the world’s largest dam builder to pull out of the Agua Zarca Dam project at the Río Gualcarque – a river sacred to her Lenca people – was slain in her home last March. More than a dozen environmental defenders have been killed in Honduras since 2014, according to Global Witness, which makes it one of the most dangerous countries in the world for activists protecting forests and rivers\nAlong with their father LeMoine, mother Nancy Bordeaux, and sister Tiana, the LaPointe brothers conceived a plan to invite Indigenous leaders from around the world to Minnesota – the font of much of the Earth’s fresh water – for a summit, which they are calling Mni Wakan: A Decade of Water.\nThorne and Wakinyan put their heads together and wrote a summons to the world’s Indigenous leaders. It came in the form of a formal statement, or in the lingo of the United Nations, an “intervention” on water.\n“The statement, a broad interpretation of the water crisis this world is experiencing, reiterated our Lakota values: Mni Wakan: water is sacred; Mni Pejuta: water is medicine; and Mni Wiconi: Water is Life,” says Wakinyan. “In our Lakota way, it is our responsibility to strengthen our relationship with water. The statement was intended to acknowledge that relationship and place it in everyone’s minds. In the process of so doing, we invited indigenous peoples, and the appropriate UN representatives, to come to Mni Wakan: Decade of Water. This will be an indigenous led, indigenous centered, water summit, which we are planning for April of 2017.”\nThe brothers made plans to deliver it to the United Nation’s Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII), which takes place each May in New York City. The LaPointes organized a successful fundraiser at the Minneapolis American Indian Center and raised enough for all five of them to travel to New York City. Thorne and Wakinyan would attend during the first week of the UNPFII, Nancy, Tiana, and LeMoine the second.\nWorking together as a family, or tiwahe, comes naturally to the LaPointes, who see their teamwork as an extension of their Lakota way of life. “Our basic political unit is the Tiwahe,” says Thorne. “Our body politic is made up of families and the stories that each of them contribute to the Tiospaye (extended family), and the Oyate (nation).”\nThe LaPointes descend from a long line of diplomats, warriors, and treaty men who have left current and future generations the responsibility of restoring the Oceti Sakowin, the Lakota Nation, to greatness. Nancy’s family tree includes Yellow Cloud, who fought against Custer at Little Bighorn; LeMoine’s includes Tall Mandan, a chief and medicine man who was a signatory to the 1851 and 1868 Fort Laramie Treaties.\n“Tall Mandan signed the 1868 treaty with his name followed by the word ‘akicita,’ which translates as warrior, but in this case means enforcer,” says LeMoine. “He was an enforcer of the treaty which meant it was his responsibility to see to it the agreements were carried out honorably and in the way they are interpreted not necessarily by our oppressors, but by the Lakota people. That duty has been handed down to us, and it to our children and grandchildren.”\nUpon arrival at the United Nations in Mid-May, the brothers were met with the cold reality of international politics. Although they have visited the world body several times in the past, this was the first time they had attempted to deliver a speech. They waited and waited each day but did not have an opportunity to read their statement to the Permanent Forum.\n“There was no time because representatives from member states have priority,” says Thorne. “They know there are indigenous delegations present from their countries, and they often don’t want them to speak. It’s the way member states filibuster; they stall and go over their time at the microphone. The United Nations may be about human rights, but that doesn’t mean it’s a human system.”\nWith the arrival in New York of their mother, sister and father, the brothers had a second chance. Nancy, Tiana, and LeMoine however, had no better luck maneuvering themselves before a live microphone. So Nancy, whose work in Minneapolis focuses on empowering women, did what she encourages everyone to do when they need help. She prayed.\n“I thought about my sons and how they had written this statement. I thought, they didn’t get a chance to read it, and then saw myself up there reading it on their behalf,” Nancy says. For the second day in a row, she then went to the scheduling desk and asked to be placed on the agenda. She faced the same woman who had denied her a time slot the previous day.\n“All of a sudden she seemed to have a change of mind said, ‘OK, I’m gonna put you on the list and you’re gonna be high priority.’” Nancy was told to return to the Permanent Forum the next morning where she would have an opportunity to address Indigenous delegations from around the world.\nNancy arrived as instructed, found a seat near the front of the auditorium, waited through three speakers. Finally, Nancy spoke into the microphone the words written by Thorne and Wakinyan:\nWater Connects us all. Without clean water there is no life. Mni wakan, water is sacred. Mni Pejuta, water is the first medicine.\nMany indigenous nations believe and know they were born from water. Yet, indigenous peoples remain the few who remember these original instructions regarding our intimate relationship with water. We do not separate the creator from creation.\nWe are facing a world-wide water crisis unlike anything we have ever seen before. Water is being consumed at an alarming rate, used unsustainably, and is contaminated more and more with each passing day.\nIndigenous people, communities, and Nations retain the wisdom and traditional ecological knowledge that is most urgently needed to restore a more sustainable future of water… Indigenous peoples and Nations must be seen as central to all activities involving water, at all levels, in that they provide the traditional ecological knowledge which is the last remaining frontline for the protection of water.\nIndigenous led water initiatives, such as the upcoming Mni Wakan: Decade of Water summit, to be held in central Minnesota, USA, in April 2017 must be fully supported as a matter of Indigenous water rights implementation. Therefore, we invite the appropriate United Nations representatives, and Indigenous peoples to attend this global Indigenous-led water summit…to close we celebrate the life of Berta Caceres of Honduras, who died protecting the sacred river and her peoples; water is life.\nReflecting on his family’s recent accomplishment at the United Nations, LeMoine says leadership by Indigenous peoples on water issues is the only way forward. “Indigenous people hear differently. We see differently. And that comes from thousands of years of intimate relationships with earth and sky. Now we have contaminated our own nest, and we can’t use science to fix it, because science is what caused it. But what we can do is listen to the wisdom of this Earth and water and follow its dictates, just as Berta Caceres did in Honduras. She said, the river called out to me, Mother Earth said she awaited help, and so she helped. And that is what we must do.”']	['<urn:uuid:31154d81-482d-4b95-9dc5-d629e023a95b>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	6	53	1378
20	Why do homemade cheeses taste different from store ones?	Traditional farmhouse cheeses differ significantly from commercial varieties because they're typically made with raw, unpasteurized milk that contains natural bacteria contributing to unique flavors. Mass-produced supermarket cheeses underwent standardization starting in the late 1800s, with the introduction of pasteurization and centralized milk distribution through the Milk Marketing Board in 1913. The industrial process involves pasteurization which kills beneficial bacteria, requiring laboratory cultures to be added back during production. Additionally, the fermentation process and moisture content are carefully regulated in industrial production, while traditional cheesemaking relies more on natural variations and the cheesemaker's expertise in managing milk qualities that change with seasons.	"[""Beating the French at the cheese game\n14:30 06 May 2009\nArtisan cheese is a product which above all reflects the essential local aspects of that subtle mixture of physical location, animal husbandry and farming techniques which the winemakers call 'terroir'.\nA good cheesemaker understands how to exploit the differing qualities of the milk each season, which in turn are due to changes in weather and the food being grazed by the herd.\nThese individual, variously shaped and differently rinded cheeses are a world away from the uniform yellow, shrink wrapped blocks which too many of us have become accustomed to by the onward march of the supermarket. And don't be deceived by the modern use of the word 'farmhouse', unfortunately it has no legal significance and can be used by anyone to try and 'legitimise' the product.\nTraditionally, a farmhouse cheese was just that, one developed on the farm as a way of preserving the milk from the dairy, all cheeses would have been made with raw milk and the by-product, whey, fed to the pigs - nothing was wasted.\nA range of cheeses would be produced on each farm - fresh, soft ones to eat straightaway, lightly pressed ones to store for a short time and hard-pressed ones, wrapped in muslin or calico to last through the winter. Since Roman times, these local and regional cheeses have been recorded literally in their hundreds.\nTalk to many artisan cheesemakers and they will tell you that the subtleties in the milk which they are trying to bring out in their cheese are really only present in raw, unpasteurised milk. There are bacteria in all cheeses which give them their individual character and flavour.\nAs well as killing off any possible bad bacteria, the heating process of pasteurisation also kill off the helpful ones, making it much harder to make anything like a decent product and requiring laboratory cultures to be added back during the cheesemaking process.\nMany cheesemakers also feel bludgeoned by regulations and lack of support from local authorities to change or revert back to raw milk. There is a lot of history to counter.\nThe homogenisation of our British cheeses started in the late 1800s as the growth in transportation led to essentially local products being moved around the country. Cheeses which up to that time would have been known by the name of the farm or farmer, started to acquire names, usually denoting the region of production - Lancashire, Caerphilly, Stilton or Gloucester - so they could be identified further afield.\nThe advent of the Milk Marketing Board in 1913 enabled farmers to sell in their milk to a central 'distributor' rather than process it themselves. This also brought about mass-pasteurisation, partly to kill off diseases but also to extend the milk's shelf life.\nThe tide of industrialisation continued along with the introduction of ever more 'rules'. Conformity became the goal. For example, during the Second World War the Ministry of Food only recognised four types of cheese Cheddar, Cheshire, Leicester and Wensleydale. If you didn't comply, it was often easier to give up.\nIn spite of the history and food hygiene issues, and after a long decline, we are now seeing a revival of artisan cheesemaking in the UK as farmers look to diversify and develop value-added products for consumers who are increasingly looking for interest, localness and variety.\nA recent count shows that The Specialist Cheesemakers Association has over 150 registered members in Britain, making over 450 unique cheeses (we possibly have more individually different cheeses now than the French!) Many of these are made using raw milk in spite of the 'lysteria hysteria' which seems to pop up every time there is some other food scare.\nThe three Worcestershire cheesemakers - Lightwoods in Lower Broadheath which uses exclusively raw milk, Gorsehill Abbey near Broadway which uses organic cows milk from their own herd and Anstey's of Worcester which uses both pasteurised and unpasteurised milk - all make some fine cheeses and are worth searching out.\nUnfortunately John and Margaret Jenkins of Mar Goats in Little Witley stopped making their wonderful goats cheeses some time ago, but alongside their cows' milk cheeses Phil Hulland of Lightwoods has recently launched two soft goats cheeses - Capria and Rhapsody - and Colin Anstey makes a tangy hard one called Snodsbury.\nA cheeseboard made up exclusively from the region's producers would take you through cow's, ewe's and goat's milk, fresh, soft, semi-soft and hard, smoked and unsmoked and even some blue. Like all small producers, they are continually refining their products and bringing new ones to the market often testing them out with loyal customers during the development process and always looking for feedback.\nSo take a real or virtual tour round the region's cheeses and decide for yourself if raw, organic or pasteurised makes a difference - but above all enjoy the fantastic quality and variety.\nOld Fashioned Cheese Pudding\nA simple dish which you can dress up if you feel like it.

It is not clear which method is the most suitable. Some claim that the reduction time is useful because it gives an indication of bacterial activity. Others have claimed that actual change of reduction time during ripening period gives a better indication. In addition, one can determine the total number of bacteria, the actual increase of the number and finally the increase in acidity (the titrated acidity). The simplest method is without doubt the latter (change of the titrated acidity). This method is simple and quick to do.\nInvestigation has shown that this change corresponds quite well to the change in bacteria numbers. The weakness is that this method requires great measuring accuracy.\nOthers have suggested a coagulation test (Marshall\'s Rennet Test) at certain intervals, as it is believed that it gives a more accurate account of the change which takes place with the acidity. Coagulation time is reversed with the hydrogen concentration. Even a very small change is possible to detect. One must not apply this method to milk which has been cooled for a longer period. Right after heating the results will be doubtful, but after approximately 1 hour the condition will have been stabilized.\nWhich pre-ripening method is used differs first with the cheese type, length of pre-cheesemaking, cooking temperature, etc.....\nA prolonged pre-ripening causes pH-decrease to occur earlier in the cheese making process. A 10 minute pre-ripening is relatively insignificant, whereas a 45 minute pre-ripening will be more effective on the bacteria. The result is a lowering of pH after 14 hours in the cheese and a larger amount of calcium to be dissolved. A pre-ripening will, therefore, always cause increased acid development and demineralizing than when cheese is not pre-ripened. An exaggerated pre-ripening can also cause the cheese to become split and acidic after storage.\nA prolonged of pre-ripening causes the milk at the beginning of cheese making to become more acidic and the bacteria to surpass the lag phase so that right from the start more acid is developed. This stronger acid development in the cheese curds causes more of the calcium, which is bound to the casein, to dissolve and go into the whey as it drains from the cheese.\nCheese acid development can be enhanced considerably by pre-ripening of cheese milk and the pre-ripening should normally be altered by only 10-15 minutes at a time.\nA ""too strong"" pre-ripening can easily cause the cheese to split, sour and brittle; while on the other hand, a too weak acid can give a tough consistency and unclean taste.\nAt the same time, strong acid development will result in less moisture content in the cheese and vice a versa.\nFinally, it is important to use a stable culture. Normally one uses an inoculation rate of 0.5-1.0 %, a pre-ripening of 20-40 minutes and a temperature of 28-32 C.(approx. 82 - 90 F.)\nDetermination of pre-ripening by titration usually indicates a titration of 0.75-1.25.\nUse manufacturer?s recommendations for direct set (e.g. Visbyvac DIP). Danlac has cheese recipes using direct set (Visbyvac DIP) and bulk starters (Visbyvac B).\nPre-stirring refers to all operations in the cheese vat from cutting to start of cooking.\nThe temperature is similar to that of pre-ripening and coagulation. The length of pre-stirring can also influence speed of acid development. A too weak pre-ripening (poor bacteria activity) can, therefore, to some degree be offset by a longer pre-stirring; and conversely, a too strong pre-ripening offset with a shorter pre-stirring.\nPre-ripening of cheese milk must therefore be considered in conjunction with pre-stirring.\nThe setting temperatures are closer to lactic acid bacteria\'s optimal temperature than the cooking temperature. A prolonged intermediate stirring will give lactic acid bacteria better development conditions. Large amounts of acid production will result. At the same time, the delayed cooking will cause the whey to stay inside the single cheese curds a little longer, and the acid curds will therefore dissolve a greater part of the calcium in the cheese curds. The resulting whey drainage which takes place under cooking will result in large amounts of calcium filtering out in the whey so that the finished cheese ends up with lesser amounts of calcium phosphate. As phosphate usually buffers the cheese, with fewer amounts, the cheese will become sourer. When the calcium is removed, the cheese becomes less elastic.']"	['<urn:uuid:9bf156b2-88aa-455f-a72d-6f6bb8deb7b8>', '<urn:uuid:edacb15a-431f-40fe-a1e0-b759de0f926f>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	9	101	2172
21	complications risks plant based diet animal operations	With plant-based diets, complications include potential nutritional deficiencies requiring supplements (especially B12), bloating from increased vegetable intake, and risk of unhealthy eating patterns if relying on processed foods. Similarly, animal operations like castration, while routine, have a 20% complication rate, with risks including post-operative bleeding, infection, and in rare cases, serious complications like intestinal prolapse requiring immediate veterinary attention.	['We recommend castration (surgical removal of the testicles) of all colts and stallions unless they are specifically required for breeding.\nThere are several reasons, other than preventing unwanted pregnancies, why castration is recommended.\n- It prevents masculine or aggressive behaviour which can be dangerous.\n- It allows male horses to be turned out with company, which, being social animals, is important for their welfare.\n- It prevents the risks of testicular trauma, or testicular cancer.\n- It prevents the risk of life-threatening colic from intestines herniating through the inguinal canal.\nWhen to Castrate?\nTypically castration is performed from the spring of the yearling year. We prefer to castrate during the Spring or Autumn to avoid mud in winter and flies in summer, but the procedure can be carried out at any time of year if necessary. Castration is usually performed between 6-18 months of age.\nThe surgical procedure\nThe open technique\nThis is the routine method of castration used in the field for both standing castrations and those performed under general anaesthesia. The testicles are removed via two surgical incisions into the scrotum. The blood vessels and other tissues running from the testicle into the abdomen are crushed and cut. The vaginal tunic and scrotum are left ‘open’ for drainage.\nThe closed technique\nThis procedure takes longer and requires a clean operating theatre environment because the tissue layers are sutured closed after the testicles have been removed so the wounds cannot drain. This technique is more costly and is recommended for older or very large stallions, especially if they have been used for breeding. The closed technique is also recommended for colts that have had a scrotal hernia.\nComplications and risk\nCastration is a routine procedure, however, as with any surgery, it is not without risk. In the vast majority of cases castration is straightforward and uncomplicated, but around 1 in 5 cases may develop complications.\nThere is an element of risk with general anaesthesia of any healthy horse, however every attempt is made to minimise the risk, and the vast majority of our castrations are done standing with sedation and without any complications.\nBleeding from the surgical site is common post-operatively and a small amount of blood dripping for the first 24 hours is normal. If more than a fast drip, or a constant stream of blood lasts for over 2 minutes, veterinary attention should be urgently sought.\nPost-operative infection of the surgical site is the second most common complication. Swelling becomes apparent and the colt may appear lame behind due to the swelling, or be depressed and inappetant. Rarely, infection can develop in the abdomen and the horse may additionally appear unwilling to move and very unwell. Veterinary attention should be sort.\nIf anything is seen hanging down from the surgical incision, veterinary attention should be sought. Usually, this is just a small piece of the vaginal tunic (fibrous sac that the testicle would have been surrounded by), which can be trimmed off by the vet.\nVery rarely, a serious complication can occur when intestines prolapse through the castration site. This is an emergency that requires immediate veterinary attention.\nCRYPTORCHIDS / ‘RIGS’\nOccasionally, one or both testicle/s may not descend into the scrotum. The retained testicle/s can be lying anywhere from the inguinal ring (groin) to near the kidneys in the abdomen, and often they are very small.\nIf one or both testicles have not descended by one year of age, it becomes increasingly unlikely that they will do so, although occasionally inguinally retained testicles can drop up to the age of 4.\nRetained testicles will still produce testosterone so masculine and aggressive behaviour can be expected, and some rigs are still fertile. For these reasons, and because retained testicles may be prone to developing cancer, it is advisable to refer rigs for surgical removal of the testicles in a hospital facility.\nSometimes older horses with an unknown history are presented to us as possible rigs because of masculine behaviour. To determine if the animal is a gelding or a rig, examination, ultrasonography and endocrinology (blood tests) can be used.', 'Vegetarian and vegan diets are nothing new, but more and more people are eating less meat these days, or at least thinking about it.\nMany are ditching meat with other ethical, environmental and health reasons in mind, too. Meatless diets have been associated with increased nutrient intake and lower risk of some chronic diseases. And meat production ― particularly beef production ― isn’t doing any favours for the health of our planet. Greenhouse gas emissions from animal-based agriculture are actually so sizeable that a report from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year recommended reducing meat consumption in order to adapt to climate change.\nBut how exactly does a meat-free diet affect your body? We reached out to some experts to find out what happens when you adopt a plant-based diet so you can decide if it’s the right choice for you.\nBefore we get into that, an important note: When we say a vegetarian diet, we’re referring to a diet that’s free of any meat and fish. But vegetarianism has many variations ― some people still eat dairy and eggs (lacto-ovo vegetarians), some allow eggs but no dairy (ovo-vegetarians), and some allow fish and sometimes dairy and eggs (pescatarian). Vegan diets don’t include any of those items.\nHere’s what you can expect when you go on a plant-based diet:\nYour bowel habits will probably change.\nEating more plant-based foods like vegetables, beans and whole grains increases your fibre intake. This will help prevent constipation, improve bowel function and probably result in more regular bowel habits.\n“Bowel regularity is beneficial for overall health and well-being,” said Colleen Chiariello, a registered dietitian and chief clinical dietitian at Northwell Health’s Syosset Hospital.\nAt the same time, you may become more bloated than usual, especially if you’ve recently upped your intake of vegetables or if you’re consistently filling up on Brussel sprouts, broccoli, cabbage and other vegetables that are known to produce excess gas.\nWhen switching to a vegetarian diet, Chiariello advised incorporating a range of fruits and vegetables, not just the same ones. Staying hydrated is important too, as drinking more fluids can minimise gas from certain fruits and vegetables.\nKeep in mind that if the gas is minimal, you probably don’t need to worry too much. “A little bit of gas is worth the benefit of colon health,” Chiariello said.\nYou’ll probably be consuming more nutrients.\nWhen you stop eating meat and switch to a vegan or vegetarian diet, you may be eating a lot more nutrient-rich foods.\n“This increases the intake of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fibre in the diet,” said Kim Rose, a registered dietitian based in Florida. “Fibre is not only an important part of a healthy digestive system; it has the potential to improve cholesterol, make you feel full for a longer period of time, give the body energy, and assist in the prevention of constipation and diarrhoea.”\nUnhealthy eating behaviours can develop if you’re not mindful of them.\nA plant-focused diet has many potential benefits, but it’s not necessarily healthier than a non-vegetarian or non-vegan diet ― especially if you’re eating a ton of processed foods.\n“It really all depends on the foods chosen and the individual nutrition needs of the person who is going vegetarian,” said Emily Hamm, a registered dietitian at Northside Hospital in Atlanta. “Research shows that there are multiple health benefits to going vegetarian if the vegetarian diet is rich in plant-based whole foods rather than just the reduction or absence of animal-based foods.”\nTim Radak, a registered dietitian in North Carolina, recommended carefully planning any dietary change in order to avoid nutritional deficiencies and other negative effects.\nFor example, “a soda and cheese pizza are vegetarian, but certainly do not promote health,” he said.\nFor some people, a diet that’s restrictive in any way can be hard to maintain and can even be associated with disordered eating patterns.\n“Consider the reason ― is it for ethical reasons like animal rights? Or is it because you feel it will be a healthier lifestyle?” said Rachel Fine, a registered dietitian in New York.\nInstead of fully avoiding any one type of food, she recommended making decisions and choices based on how certain foods make you feel physically, emotionally and ethically.\nYou probably won’t have any trouble getting enough protein.\nMany people fear plant-based diets, thinking they won’t be able to get enough protein without meat. But the truth is, lots of these foods are high in protein. It’s good to be mindful of protein intake, but you probably won’t struggle to consume enough protein if you’re being mindful.\n“A variety of nuts and seeds — such as pistachios and quinoa, beans and peas, and soy-based products — such as tofu and tempeh, are good sources of protein that also contain an array of vitamins and minerals that will properly nourish,” Rose said.\nBut there is a caveat here: You’ll want to pay attention to the source of the protein you reach for since many of the meat-replacement products some vegetarians rely on are heavily processed and can be high in sodium.\nYou may need to take dietary supplements.\nWhile you might consume a lot more nutrients than usual after transitioning to a vegetarian diet, you still may need to take dietary supplements to avoid certain nutrient deficiencies.\nMany vegetarians or vegans take supplements for vitamin B12, which is available mostly in animal products and only in a small number of plant-based foods. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause fatigue, weakness, neurological disorders and other problems. Other supplements common among vegetarians or vegans are iron, vitamin D and calcium. But this all depends on your individual body and diet.\n“Check with your dietitian and health care provider if you are concerned about your vitamin or mineral status and tell your health care providers if you follow any dietary restrictions,” Hamm said. “Lab work and a nutrition-focused physical assessment will reveal if there are deficiencies.”\nYour heart health may improve.\n“Much of the fibre found in produce is soluble, which has been shown to improve cholesterol,” Fine said. Soluble fibre dissolves in water and binds with cholesterol in the small intestine so that the cholesterol leaves the body through your faeces rather than being absorbed into your bloodstream, where it can contribute to plaque build-up in the arteries.\nA lot of foods consumed in a plant-focused diet are beneficial to heart health, too. Fine pointed out that flax seeds and canola oil are good sources of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory properties. And olive oil, avocado, almonds, peanuts and other nuts are good sources of healthy fats that protect your heart.\nYou may have a reduced risk of cancer.\nPlant-based foods contain phytochemicals — naturally occurring chemical compounds that not only contribute to the colour, taste and smell of plants but also protect human health and help our bodies fight off disease. Some research shows that these phytochemicals may protect against certain types of cancer.\nThe bottom line: A vegetarian diet can have a lot of positive benefits to your overall health, especially if you’re loading up on nutrient-dense, plant-based, whole foods. But it all depends on what you’re eating ― swapping meat with highly processed food isn’t the best option. Take some time to examine if it’s best for you, and if you’re ever unsure, you should always chat with your doctor.']	['<urn:uuid:059401f8-02fb-44e7-b1d5-6bd2470f8eca>', '<urn:uuid:62d86948-180b-4209-86dc-24476134ebec>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	7	59	1914
22	dorothy wordsworth clare hollingworth achievements pioneering women compare accomplishments	Dorothy Wordsworth and Clare Hollingworth were both pioneering women in different fields. Dorothy Wordsworth was celebrated as a first-rate nature writer who walked extensively in the Lake District, Scotland, and mainland Europe, not just known for inspiring her famous brother's poems. Clare Hollingworth was a groundbreaking war correspondent who broke the news of World War II's outbreak in 1939 and covered many major 20th-century events, including conflicts in Vietnam, Algeria, and the Middle East.	['Twelve of the biographies and memoirs I have enjoyed reading and reviewing in 2021. Thank you for reading the blog this year, and wishing you a very Happy New Year for 2022.\nBurning Man: The Ascent of D. H. Lawrence (Bloomsbury, 2021) by Frances Wilson is a picaresque and immersive biography that paints a brilliant cinematographic picture of a decade of D.H. Lawrence’s life, from 1915 to 1925. (I wrote about the book, and Lawrence’s women friends and supporters, in my blogpost here). I also enjoyed re-reading Frances Wilson’s passionate and brilliant early biography, The Ballad of Dorothy Wordsworth (Faber), reissued in a beautiful paperback edition earlier this year. It’s timely as Dorothy Wordsworth was born 250 years ago this month, and a recent Guardian editorial celebrated her life and writing as a ‘rare achievement’, not just for inspiring her famous brother’s poems, but as a first-rate nature writer in her own right.\nDorothy Wordsworth was a great walker in her younger days and walked for miles in the Lake District, Scotland and mainland Europe. I enjoyed Windswept: Walking in the footsteps of remarkable women by Annabel Abbs (Two Roads Books) a powerful memoir-biography about how walking in nature changed the lives and inspired the writing of writers including Nan Shepherd, Simone de Beauvoir, Gwen John and the author herself. Another book about women who travelled far from home is Undreamed Shores (Granta) by Frances Larson. ‘They went from the periphery into the unknown’, Larson writes, ‘and I doubt that any of them felt fully at home in England again.’ It’s a compelling group biography tracing the lives of five pioneering anthropologists who were among the first to study anthropology at Oxford University. My TLS review is here. I also loved Emily Midorikawa’s Out of the Shadows: six visionary Victorian women in search of a public voice (Counterpoint Press, 2021), a beautifully written, absorbing group biography that offers new insights into how six enterprising women succeeded in making spiritualism the means of gaining power, money and influence. More on this book, and the American Caroline Jebb’s trenchant views of the Cambridge University spiritualists of the 1870s, in my blogpost here.\nDing Dong! Avon Calling! by Katina Manko (OUP, 2021) is a well-written and perceptive American business history that takes seriously the ambitions and achievements of Avon Inc.’s vast, all-female network of saleswomen from the late nineteenth century to the present day. Avon celebrated these women as entrepreneurs, while systematically excluding them from the company’s senior management. I wrote about it for the 24 September TLS here. I highly recommend Mother of Invention: How Good Ideas Get Ignored In An Economy Built For Men by the Swedish economist Katrine Marçal (Harper Collins). Wittily translated by Alex Fleming, Marçal’s book is a fresh and highly readable account of how women’s brilliant ideas (from the wheelie suitcase to bra technology for spacesuits) have been overlooked through history until men decided to make these ideas their own, at a cost to the world’s economy. Kathleen Dixon Donnelly’s multi-volume series Such Friends: The Literary 1920s presents colourful, diary-like snippets, skilfully woven together, from the daily lives of writers, poets and artists of the Irish Literary Renaissance, the Bloomsbury Group, the Americans in Paris, and the Algonquin Round Table in New York. There are excerpts on her ‘Such Friends’ blog here.\nMy favourite literary memoir this year was Marina Warner’s evocative Inventory of a Life Mislaid: An Unreliable Memoir (Harper Collins; published as Esmond and Ilia: An Unreliable Memoir in the USA). It’s a richly detailed, sharp and sympathetic memoir, beautifully illustrated by Sophie Herxheimer, that uses treasured mementoes to connect family secrets to Britain’s colonial past, and offers insights into how Warner became a writer. My review is in the 26 March TLS here; I also wrote about Warner’s Cambridge connections in my March blogpost, ‘The Cambridge bookshop’. In November 2021 there was a welcome reissue by Faber of Virginia Cowles’s Looking For Trouble, a wonderfully fresh and vivid memoir of this remarkable, but nowadays little-known, woman war correspondent. A bestseller when it was first published in 1941, Looking For Trouble showcases Cowles’s great courage and ability to write, no matter what dangerous situation she found herself in. She is one of the six women wartime reporters featured in Judith Mackrell’s new group biography Going With The Boys (Pan Macmillan; published in the USA The Correspondents: Six Women Writers on the Front Lines of World War II), an entertaining and well-researched book highlighting the lives and work of Martha Gellhorn, Clare Hollingworth, Helen Kirkpatrick, Sigrid Schultz and Lee Miller. Mackrell, a Guardian journalist, is the guest in the latest ‘Lost Ladies of Lit’ podcast, a wonderful series about ‘forgotten’ women writers which I can thoroughly recommend (I was honoured to be a ‘Lost Ladies’ guest myself in April this year, discussing Amy Levy’s Reuben Sachs).\nLast, but certainly not least, is Constance Ruzich’s International Poetry of The First World War (Bloomsbury Academic; forthcoming in paperback in April 2022). As I noted in my previous blogpost, it’s an anthology that draws together a diverse range of often overlooked poetic voices, revealing a more complex picture of the First World War and its aftermath. I particularly valued the careful research that went into the biographical notes accompanying each poem, revealing the personal stories of women and men, combatants and noncombatants and those for and against the war. There is more on Ruzich’s blog ‘Behind Their Lines’, here: and it would be wonderful if, in future years, there might be a film or play about the early jazz musician, bandleader and war hero, Lieut. James Rees Europe, pictured below.\n© Ann Kennedy Smith, 28 December 2021', 'Clare Hollingworth, the British foreign correspondent who has died aged 105, was just three days into her first journalism job when she landed the biggest scoop of her career.\nAged 27 and newly-hired by the Daily Telegraph, she was dispatched to Poland in August 1939 where she witnessed Nazi tanks gathering in their hundreds at the German-Polish border.\nHer front page report, which ran without a byline, was headlined “1,000 tanks massed on Polish border. Ten divisions reported ready for swift strike” and broke the news of the outbreak of the second world war. It also heralded the start of an extraordinary career that saw Hollingworth report on many of the biggest stories of the 20th century.\nHer death was confirmed on Tuesday in a short family statement on the Facebook page Celebrate Clare Hollingworth. It read: “We are sad to announce that after an illustrious career spanning a century of news, celebrated war correspondent Clare Hollingworth died this evening in Hong Kong.”\nHong Kong had been Hollingworth’s home since the 1980s, following a globe-trotting career for many newspapers including the Guardian, during which she bore witness to horrors in Vietnam, Algeria, the Middle East, India and Pakistan. She also reported on the cultural revolution in China, and was credited with the first and last interviews with the shah of Iran.\nHer impressive postwar scoops included the fact that Kim Philby was the so-called “third man’ in the Cambridge spy ring alongside Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess. In 1963, while working in Beirut for the Guardian, she wrote that Philby, who working for the Observer in the same city, was missing and suspected of defecting to Russia.\nShe was bitterly disappointed when the Guardian, fearing a libel suit, put the story on hold for three months. When it was published, other papers picked it up. Shortly afterwards the government admitted it believed Philby had indeed fled to Russia.\nBorn in Leicester in 1911 and raised on a farm, Hollingworth attended domestic science college at her father’s insistence before going to work as secretary to the League of Nations organiser in Worcester. She won a scholarship to the School of Slavonic Studies at London University, and then attended Zagreb university to study Croatian.\nAs a young political activist she began working for a charity in Europe that helped save thousands of refugees from the Nazis. She booked a Christmas holiday to Kitzbuhel in Austria in 1938, but instead carried out reconnaissance in the ski resort, acquiring a Nazi-approved visa that would allow her to work for the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia.\nSent to Katowice, she led an operation to help refugees get visas to come to Britain. Archives suggest she helped between 2,000 and 3,000 people get to the UK, but her work was shut down in July 1939, with letters from MI5 suggesting there were complaints from those in the corridors of power that “undesirables” such as Germans, Jews and communists were arriving in Britain with visas she had signed.\nBack in London, she “ran into” the editor of the Daily Telegraph and convinced him to sent her back to Poland as a stringer. Once there, she borrowed a diplomat’s car and drove into German-held territory, where she saw tanks, artillery and armoured cars.\nShe would later say that the British embassy in Warsaw was so disbelieving of her account that she was forced to hold her telephone receiver out of her hotel window in Katowice for the diplomat to hear the Wehrmacht for himself.\nOf her scoop, she told the Telegraph in 2009: “I broke the story when I was very, very young. I went there to look after the refugees, the blind, the deaf and the dumb. While I was there, the war suddenly came into being”.\nAfter the Russian army entered Poland, she moved to Bucharest and worked for the Daily Express. She later covered the Middle East for the Economist and the Observer, then moved to Paris for the Guardian, and from there to Beirut. She returned to the Daily Telegraph in 1967 and was posted to China in 1973, remaining in Asia for the rest of her days.\nShe narrowly escaped death in 1946 when a bomb blast destroyed the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, killing almost 100 people. She was just 300 yards away.\nHollingworth married twice, to the writer Vandeleur Robinson and then to the Times journalist Geoffrey Hoare, who gave her a stepdaughter. She dismissed the idea of having children of her own, preferring to devote herself to work. She was the author of five books drawing on her extraordinary experiences.\nShe once said of her career: “When I was very small, in world war one, I used to hear people talk about the battles, and I did become extremely interested in warfare. I’m not brave, I just enjoy it.”\n“She kept no family photographs or children’s drawings,” her great nephew, Patrick Garrett, the author of Of Fortune and War: Clare Hollingworth, First of the Female War Correspondents, once wrote. “Her entire life has been defined by her work. To her, breaking news is all that really matters.”\nShe was a celebrated member of the Foreign Correspondent’s Club (FCC) in Hong Kong, having her own corner table which she used to visit almost daily. The FCC president, Tara Joseph, said: “Clare had a remarkable career as a foreign correspondent, beginning with the scoop of the century when she reported the start of world war two.” A wake will be held at the club in her honour.\nHollingworth received the James Cameron award for journalism in 1994 and a lifetime achievement award at the What the Papers Say awards in 1999.']	['<urn:uuid:6b71a210-e945-4a74-825b-acc5db90b84a>', '<urn:uuid:f3a8ea19-eeb5-4fed-97ef-5795002ee3be>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	9	74	1898
23	As a music student, what distinguished Dave Brubeck's and Frank Morgan's comeback periods?	The two jazz artists had very different comeback trajectories. Frank Morgan experienced a 30-year gap between his first and second albums due to drug addiction and incarceration, making a remarkable return in the mid-1980s with a celebrated Village Vanguard performance that marked both his comeback and New York debut. He continued working successfully until his death in 2007. Brubeck, by contrast, maintained a steady career trajectory without major interruptions, continuing to push jazz boundaries until his death in 2012, though his innovative approach - especially with unusual time signatures like in 'Take Five' - initially faced resistance from record executives and critics.	['MAY 10, 2020\nPIANIST AND COMPOSER Dave Brubeck, forever known as the man behind the groundbreaking recording “Take Five,” is something of an enigma in the jazz world. He studied with several of the most influential modernist European composers, was an undisputed innovator several times over, garnered more or less every major award and honor possible, and in a 60-year career released around a hundred LPs, which include some of the best-selling jazz records of all time. Yet — let’s be honest — his name is rarely mentioned in the same breath as those of Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, or Sun Ra. Why is that?\nOne somewhat awkward explanation may be that he was white. Related is the fact that he grew up in a comfortable, even privileged, family in the San Francisco suburbs, and spent most of his career on the West Coast, whose laid-back jazz scene has often been treated as the red-headed stepchild of the edgier New York scene. Another explanation, for which there is no shortage of evidence, is Brubeck’s reputation as a “highbrow” or “academic,” rightly or wrongly an indelible stain among many jazz critics and artists. And then — surely connected to the above — there’s the relative dearth of books and articles about him.\nPhilip Clark’s Dave Brubeck: A Life in Time goes a long way toward correcting this. It’s hard to imagine anyone more qualified to write a Brubeck bio than Clark, who spent long periods of time with the man, his band members, and his wife Iola; had unlimited access to his papers and correspondence; and has been a flag-waving fan of the music for ages. His book, though only just short of 400 pages, contains a head-spinning amount of detail bordering on micro-history, with in-depth accounts of recording dates and tours going back to the beginning, as well as the kind of musical analysis that could only have come from years of close listening. To call it “exhaustive” is to undersell it, but those looking for a straight-ahead narrative may be surprised by what they find.\nFor reasons that aren’t completely clear, Clark mostly separates Brubeck’s musical history from his early family history, saving the latter for the last quarter of the book. But the family history is actually an important background to the music. Brubeck’s mother, Elizabeth, was highly cultured. She had been tutored by composer Henry Cowell and at one point moved to London — her three young kids staying at home in California with her husband — to study with the great pianists Myra Hess and Tobias Matthay. (Brubeck’s father, Pete, by contrast, was a rancher and wanted his sons to follow in his footsteps, the source of some tension in the family.) Elizabeth gave him piano lessons at an early age, and taught him how to harmonize Bach chorales. Though Brubeck was influenced first and foremost by the jazz stars of his youth — Benny Goodman, Art Tatum, and Fats Waller — all this classical training made Brubeck’s approach to composition and playing unique among jazz musicians.\nIn fact, the voracious Brubeck’s musical consumption extended even further. One set of recordings he listened to avidly while growing up was The Belgian Congo Records of the Denis-Roosevelt Expedition, a collection of ritualistic dances, songs, and chants assembled in the 1930s. There’s no doubt that these recordings influenced Brubeck’s radical (by Western standards) approach to rhythm, certainly his most enduring legacy. But the figure who exerted the greatest overt influence on him was the French avant-garde composer Darius Milhaud, whom Brubeck studied with at Mills College. Significantly, Milhaud was very taken with American jazz, having enthusiastically visited Harlem jazz clubs and collected records from the Harlem-based Black Swan label. But Milhaud was also a proponent of polytonality, which entailed playing in two or more keys simultaneously, a nearly heretical idea in classical music in the early 20th century, and more heretical still in jazz. Polytonality would be one of the identifying features of Brubeck’s music from the beginning. His early piece “Curtain Music,” for example, opens with Brubeck playing an A major chord with his right hand and a G major with his left.\nBrubeck and his quartet could swing with the best of them, but his outré experiments with tonality would earn him a continuous stream of opprobrium throughout his career. He was branded, early and often, as an “academic” or “intellectual” — and not in a good way. In a 1956 opinion piece in the Philadelphia Jazz Digest, saxophonist Billy Root compared Brubeck unfavorably to Charlie Parker: “Brubeck fans think they have to ‘study’ his music […] The very title of one of his albums, Jazz Goes to College, is ridiculous.” (The album title was meant to be a pun, as the record was recorded live at several colleges; it clearly backfired.) But Root’s was a bad-faith argument; as Clark points out, “Until the rise of John Coltrane, no jazz musician’s solos were pored over, transcribed, learned, and absorbed into jazz language more than Charlie Parker’s.” Furthermore, Parker himself was an admirer of Brubeck.\nClark, to his credit, sees an obvious parallel here in rock music history, with the long-running wars between progressive rock fans and punks. Like Brubeck in the 1950s, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, who were among the coterie of groups that pushed rock music well past its original three-chord, blues-based framework in the ’70s, “stood accused of turning music that audiences ought to be able to feel in their gut into an over-intellectualized game,” writers Clark. There’s a certain reactionary impulse that surfaces from time to time among advocates of “simplicity” or “going back to the roots” in rock music, and, similarly, throughout Brubeck’s career the word “feel” comes up as something that his supposedly over-intellectualized music does not have. Brubeck himself, inevitably, opined on this subject more than once. In what is now an eerie pre-echo of the debate for and against the “progressive” impulse in rock, Brubeck said, “I don’t see any challenge in [Dixieland music, an early strain of jazz] for a young kid. Makes me sick to see a young kid playing Dixie […] if that’s all he can play. From an audience standpoint it’s even worse; there’s so little challenge in it.” This strong statement needs context: Brubeck had nothing but respect for jazz’s early practitioners, but he had no time for bands that in the ’50s were trying to recreate the past instead of making something new — “a pointless rewind, Brubeck thought, back through history,” to quote Clark.\nWhich brings us to the elephant in the room: “Take Five,” the 1959 tune (actually composed by Brubeck’s saxophonist Paul Desmond) that marked the innovation Brubeck is best known for, the piece that made his name and his fortune. “Take Five” was played in the time signature 5/4 — containing five beats to each measure rather than four. Though today the vast majority of Western music is still in 4/4, it’s hard to imagine an era when virtually all of it was, even in jazz, supposedly the most rhythmically adventurous genre around. But that was the state of things in 1959, and, in fact, on Time Out, the LP that included “Take Five,” Brubeck went even further with “Blue Rondo à la Turk,” in what would have seemed like a completely incomprehensible and almost alien 9/8. (The “Blue Rondo” rhythm was inspired by music Brubeck had heard street musicians playing in Istanbul, where presumably it would not have been so strange.) In all-knowing retrospect, including these two tunes on a Brubeck album seems uncontroversial enough, but that was not the attitude of Columbia Records at the time. “I was very seriously advised, by people at Columbia, not to put Time Out out,” Brubeck said, because “no one will dance to something in 5/4 or 9/8.” The abstract painting on the record’s cover, rather than the traditional group photo, and the fact that the album contained all original compositions and no standards, added to Columbia’s unease. Surely they would take a bath on the LP, right?\nNo points for guessing what happened next: in a world-historic rebuke to the timorous label execs, Time Out was the first jazz album ever to sell more than a million copies, the biggest hit ever by an instrumental jazz group. The influence of “Take Five” since its release has been enormous, inspiring rock musicians from The Kinks’ Ray Davies to Steely Dan’s Donald Fagen to Pink Floyd (whose song “Money” is in 7/4) to the aforementioned ELP. (Keith Emerson was a huge fan, doing a cover of “Blue Rondo” with his early group The Nice and asking Brubeck to sign his sheet music copy of the tune later on.) It’s not unreasonable to wonder whether ’70s jazz fusion or ’90s math rock would have existed had Brubeck not blown through the 4/4 door earlier on. More recently, pop-jazz singer Al Jarreau did a vocal version of “Blue Rondo,” which was later sampled by Nas — though Nas smoothed the rhythm out to a more easily digestible 12/8.\nMost of the above is not news. What Clark’s book substantially adds to the historical record is hitherto unknown information about the “Take Five” sessions, including the piece’s genesis in rehearsals and early takes, showing, among other things, that even for Brubeck’s crack group, mastering and then improvising over a 5/4 rhythm was no walk in the park.\nOnce they did master it, occasional self-knockoffs were inevitable, including the 1961 LP Time Further Out, which included the 7/4 tune “Unsquare Dance.” (Could that tune, which prominently features handclaps, have been an influence on Steve Reich’s not-dissimilar 1972 piece Clapping Music, in 6/4?) But by and large Brubeck and his group didn’t rest on their laurels, continuing to push the boundaries of jazz until Brubeck’s death in 2012. Yet jazz it remained, for despite the fact that many critics considered Brubeck’s music a jazz-classical hybrid, Brubeck himself once stated, “I cannot play classical piano,” and insisted that “the heart and development section of [his pieces] are the improvised choruses,” not the composition — a decidedly jazz-oriented view. Nevertheless, Brubeck participated in numerous collaborations with classical composers and conductors, including Leonard Bernstein and — almost — Harry Partch, in a project that was sadly scotched by Brubeck’s record company.\nAmong the most welcome revelations in Clark’s book are the details on Brubeck’s personal life, which, it has to be said, include little sex (he was married to Iola, his only wife, for more than 60 years), drugs, or criminal activity. Quite the opposite: Brubeck, whose compositions include “History of a Boy Scout,” seems to have had an admirable code of ethics. He somehow managed to steer clear of the Mob at a time when that was virtually impossible, refusing payments that would have compromised him. He was exceedingly decent to his less pure band members, helping them out with cash and, in extreme cases, even working with the authorities to keep them out of jail. And on a month-long Southern tour in 1960, when he was told he had to drop the African-American member of his group, bassist Gene Wright, he refused, costing himself an estimated $40,000 in lost bookings, a tremendous sum for the time. Four years later, at the peak of the Civil Rights movement, the Brubeck quartet, with Wright, played a concert at the University of Alabama to an integrated audience, in defiance of threats from the Ku Klux Klan.\nBeing an “intellectual” means Brubeck left behind much in addition to his massive body of recorded music. His many interviews, liner notes, and concert program notes leave a substantial record of his thoughts on composition and performance, and even stagecraft. Among the most interesting of these is a mission statement–cum–manifesto that he distributed to his group in the ’50s, titled “The DB Quartet — Principles and Aims.” The document — meant “to help clarify to the members of this group the purpose and individual responsibilities of each man” — contains instructions to the band on such topics as “polyphonic banter” in concert, “appropriate deportment while on stage” (as Clark puts it), and even listening recommendations (“‘folk material of all countries’ and the percussion music of the Far East”). As a statement of intent, that might not rank up there with the “harmolodics” that Ornette Coleman drummed into his band’s heads, but it seems very much in keeping with Brubeck’s style. If Coleman’s appearance on the scene was a nuclear bomb, Brubeck’s assault on jazz was deliberate, measured, and low-key.

With artistic flourishes, N.C. Heikin’s documentary portrait fits the exceptional life story into a biographical boilerplate that covers the general trajectory and turning points. Sound of Redemption: The Frank Morgan Story, which had its world premiere at the Los Angeles Film Festival, collects evocative archival material, including interviews with Morgan, and new commentary from friends and admirers that’s often incisive. But what makes the film memorable, and a must for jazz fans, is its deep feeling for Morgan’s playing and, especially, the 2012 concert that frames the story—in which six jazz luminaries paid tribute to Morgan at San Quentin, the California state prison where he spent a significant portion of three decades.\nPlaying professionally when still in his teens, Morgan was a spiritual son and artistic heir to bebop virtuoso Charlie “Bird” Parker, and considered by many the greatest alto sax player of his generation. But instead of picking up the mantle that seemed so clearly his, Morgan fell into a life of drug addiction, crime and incarceration.\nTelling the story of his promise, self-destruction and renewal, Heikin explores the jumping art-and-music scene of Los Angeles in the late ’40s and ’50s. Morgan had come out to the coast to join his father, guitarist Stanley Morgan, a member of the popular vocal group the Ink Spots. (Frank Morgan’s half-sister notes pointedly that their father had another, illicit occupation as well.) In the heyday of Central Avenue clubs, the young Morgan quickly drew attention, backing such major talents as Billie Holiday and winning a TV talent show whose prize, an engagement with an orchestra at the Palladium, was denied him because he wasn’t white.\nThe film’s interviewees acknowledge the painful effects of segregation and racism on many African American artists of the era. Some of Morgan’s fellow musicians discuss how they, as black males, were discouraged from attending college or even taking academic, rather than vocational, high school classes. Heroin’s role as an extreme analgesic is acknowledged too. For Morgan, the heroin use of his friend and idol Bird became something to emulate, along with his groundbreaking bebop (Bird disapproved).\nWith Parker’s death in 1955, Morgan lost not just his mentor but his sense of musical purpose, and the expectations surrounding the release of his debut album apparently scared more than excited him. He put his creative energies into larceny, robbing banks and kiting checks to maintain an expensive habit—represented in the film by faceless, soft-focus junkie enactments that are more conspicuous than helpful.\nMany of the details of his life remain out of focus as well. One interviewee is identified as Morgan’s eighth wife, but the only romantic relationship described is his marriage to painter Rosalinda Kolb, who appears in the film and was a crucial figure in his mid-’80s rehabilitation and career revival. That amounted to a remarkable second chance that kept him working for the remainder of his life.\nHeikin offers generous audio selections of Morgan’s playing—his tone is one of tender melancholy and clarity—but skimps on video performance clips. It’s disappointing that she doesn’t turn off the talking-heads commentary long enough to let a performance of Morgan’s play out in full, or at least at greater length than what’s offered here. It’s especially frustrating when she includes footage of his 1986 Village Vanguard show—an engagement that marked his comeback after 30 years and his New York debut—and cuts away from Morgan to include utterly unnecessary descriptions of how important the gig was and how well it went, rather than trusting the audience to experience it.\nBut in the tribute concert at San Quentin, intercut throughout the documentary, music does the talking. In a plain cinder-block room, a sextet headed by pianist George Cables and trombonist Delfeayo Marsalis plays songs that Morgan recorded, including tunes by Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk and McCoy Tyner. Saxophonist Grace Kelly, a protege of Morgan’s, brings down the house with a soulful “Over the Rainbow.” The musicians, who also include Ron Carter, Mark Gross and Marvin “Smitty” Smith, express love and admiration in every note, and as the prisoners respond to the music, their faces indicate that they second the emotion.\nIt was in that very penitentiary that Morgan became something of a celebrity during his “lost” years. In prisoner-made tuxes, he and his fellow San Quentin All-Stars, a 16-piece band whose members included Dexter Gordon, performed for paying visitors. The prison was an entertainment destination—one of the fascinating aspects of Morgan’s story and Heikin’s film: in the bleakest of circumstances, the transcendent, intricate beauty of great music.\nProduction companies: Hieronymus Pictures, Green Garnet Prods., Wild at Heart Films\nWith: Delfeayo Marsalis, George Cables, Ron Carter, Mark Gross, Grace Kelly, Martin “Smitty” Smith, Clora Bryant, Ed Reed, Rosalinda Kolb, Gary Giddins, Michael Connelly\nDirector: N.C.

24	How do sports injuries get treated at professional events?	At professional events like the CrossFit Games, injuries are treated through multiple approaches. Medical teams provide immediate care including forced fluids, IV fluids, and ice packs for overheated athletes. They also treat hand rips from pull-ups with gauze and bandages. For more serious injuries, they monitor athletes and provide appropriate medical referrals. Sport Rehabilitators then help in recovery through comprehensive treatment including exercise rehabilitation, manual therapy, massage, taping/bracing, and electrotherapy.	"['I returned from the CrossFit Games exhausted, jet lagged and weary, without even picking up a barbell, but it was worth it. Most of it was my fault for trying to squeeze in the CrossFit games into a weekend without disrupting much patient office time. I will never take a red eye flight again in my lifetime. It felt like I was in purgatory, I was so tired but could not sleep. I will say if you do have to fly across America that Virgin America does everything they can to make it pleasurable, including ordering food and drink from your seat to video games from your own personal remote control in your seat to a music selection that looks like 400 song iPod. You can even text other people on the plane from the television screen. Anyway back to the Games.\nEven the medical team did not know about Pendleton. This secret was withheld from most of the staff. The Marines were there to help out. So as a result I did not get to see Pendleton. The word was that people were using their fins a lot and were kicking using their quads which came back to bite them during the bike and run. Everyone throughout the weekend kept saying, “These workouts are crazy enough but they just spent themselves on a triathlon.” It kept looming over people’s heads throughout the weekend as they kept pushing.\nThe first day was extremely muggy and rainy and Californians did not like the weather. The rain definitely played a factor on the Big Bob slowing down people in mud. The Big Bob or Mr. Bob or however you want to call that Egyptian pyramid building machine wreaked havoc on people in a very deceptive way. Here you can see the puddles collecting on the track.\nWe had a few people that needed forced fluids and a couple for IV fluids. That was the part that amazed me. Most people could get their energy level back on their own without intravenous fluid. We would pack ice packs all around them in their axillae, trunk, and groin. As they drank water they would start to perk up and feel less nauseated. Once they were walking and peeing and felt like they had a normal temperature, some would venture into the ice baths. As seen here it was like a big recycling bin filled with water and ice. I felt like getting some 12 ouncers and throwing them on top. Dan Tyminski is seen here enjoying his coconut water.\nI do know that if you are Australian and smile, nurses will give you any amount of gauze, bandages, tape, or Neosporin ointment that you want. Fact. We were inundated with rips on hands from pull-up and muscle up workouts. It got to the point that we would be watching the workout in the medical headquarter room and the ESPN camera would show the winners of that heat and invariably they would show their hands to the camera as if they were showing off their badges of courage. We would then get ready for them knowing they were only 100 yards away from us. Communication was excellent between the teams and judges. We had walkie talkies to link three medical teams that were stationed at the master’s events, stadium events and the track. I should also mention and thank Mr. Brian Thurmond, Navy special amphibious reconnaissance corpsman, and Dr. Michael Ray, Medical Director of the Crossfit Games, who were in charge of the Medical Team and had it running smoothly all weekend long. If a judge thought there was a medical issue they would go stand over the athlete and shoot their hand straight up in the air. The team would watch the athletes and judges although sometimes there was so much action it was tough to watch everything at once. We had breaks so we remained fresh on our watches. We did not want to have too many responders out on the tracks at once as we would get swarmed at the end of workouts with people coming into the tents for care. There was also the athlete service tent which had air-conditioning for the athletes and ample space for stretching out, relaxing and eating.\nReebok was very generous to the athletes and spectators. At the end of the Games, Matt O’Toole Chief Marketing Officer for Reebok, the guy that gives Rich Froning and Annie Thorisdottir their yearly paychecks, announced that they would have an open bar for all the spectators at the end of the Games. Imagine being at Fenway for a Red Sox-Yankees playoff game and the Red Sox ownership says,” Wait don’t leave yet, we don’t want this ride to end, we’re having too much fun, have a (or many) drink(s) on us!” Very nice touch and thank you Matt.\nI will say that Reebok under the direction of Justin Bergh, General Manager of the CrossFit Games, did a stellar job at coordinating so many facets of the Games. From getting the bars cleaned to prevent blood borne diseases to setting up the equipment safely and spacing out the barbells properly, they executed everything right down to the finest details. I remember the last women’s workout set-up and Justin Bergh himself came out and started moving the barbells to spread them out so no one was on top of each other. At one point Julie Foucher was doing box jumps and a barbell slowly came rolling over to her as her back was turned and she almost came down on the barbell. You could hear people in the crowd slowly gasp as they could imagine what was about to happen if she jumped down on the barbell from the box jump. Luckily she did not get hurt. Unfortunately we did have some injuries.\nI don’t want to tell any information about the people that were hurt with all the HIPPA regulations and all. Let’s just say there was a biceps tear at the elbow when the athlete admitted that he tried to curl the wide bar because he could not get his hands around it normally. A master had a triceps tear off his elbow extending his arm and then was able to finish his workout amazingly which I think involved a rope climb. We had an unfortunate incident during the team workout where an athlete fell off the GHD landing on her back and was sent to the hospital with severe muscle spasms and to get X-rays. Another elite athlete with a history of SVT or supra ventricular tachycardia went into that rhythm during a workout, finished her workout and then with a variety of maneuvers such as Valsalva and carotid massage was able to return to normal sinus rhythm. She was great because she was in this rhythm and wanted to sit right up and cheer on the rest of her friends yet to finish. The announcers were screaming it all weekend; you don’t see any other competition of athletic prowess where your competition sits and waits and screams at you, encouraging you to finish. It is a pretty special site to witness on any given WOD but also when the Fittest of CrossFitters do the same.\nHas CrossFit arrived and become mainstream? Yes and I have proof.\nThe Blimp circling overhead. But also the swarm of crowds around these athletes asking for pictures and autographs alarmed me that this is becoming a pretty popular thing. People walking by looking at the individual athletes like rock stars and you hear, “oh that is such and such and he works out at CF..”\nPeople have asked me what is the best memory of the weekend? Was it gawking incredulously at Rich Froning’s and Annie Thorisdottir’s dominance, seeing the Final Team WOD, taking care of the athletes, hanging out with Daigle talking in metaphors?', ""About Sport Rehabilitation\nWhat is Sport Rehabilitation?\nSport Rehabilitators help people suffering from pain, injury or illness involving the musculoskeletal system. They help people of all ages and all backgrounds to maintain their health and fitness, recover from and prevent injury and reduce pain using exercise, movement and manual based therapeutic interventions.\nWhat to expect from your Sport Rehabilitator?\nAn initial consultation will offer an in-depth interview and physical assessment to identify an appropriate diagnosis, any predisposing factors to injury and any other health related disorders. Your Sport Rehabilitator will then use clinical reasoning to tailor a recovery plan to return you to optimum function and physical activity. You can expect your Sport Rehabilitator to integrate advice, assessment, education and rehabilitation into all aspects of your life.\nSport Rehabilitators are trained to carefully record and protect all personal information, including relevant sensitive information as part of the treatment session. Effective record keeping also ensures that your Sport Rehabilitator can ensure accurate and appropriate progression in your ongoing care.\nWhat might my treatment include?\nTreatment will incorporate a comprehensive assessment, evidenced based therapeutic interventions and exercise with the plan being monitored and modified where needed. This could include exercise rehabilitation, graded activity, manual therapy, workplace assessment and modification, massage, taping / bracing and electrotherapy.\nSport Rehabilitators will use a complete approach, considering the whole needs of the individual to allow optimal recovery and placing the patient at the centre of their own care.\nWhat sets Sport Rehabilitators apart?\nSport Rehabilitators have a strong focus on biomechanics, exercise rehabilitation and returning patients to high levels of function. The overall skill set and focus is why the Ministry of Defence chooses BASRaT registrants for their most demanding exercise rehabilitation roles.\nRegistered Sport Rehabilitators are trained to carry out a comprehensive assessment, including cardiovascular disease risk stratification, pre-participation screening and the recognition of conditions that require referral to General Practitioners and other members of the healthcare team. Injuries treated include:\n- Back, neck and spine pain - lower back pain, sciatica, disc problems and more\n- Pains and sprains in ankles, knees, shoulder, neck, groin, hip etc\n- Post-operative rehabilitation - (spinal, shoulder and knee surgery, joint replacements)\n- Total knee replacement rehabilitation\n- Achilles Tendinopathy\n- Cruciate ligament rehabilitation\n- Tennis elbow\n- Carpal tunnel syndrome\n- Injuries with an uncertain diagnosis\n- Post spinal surgery\n- Post trauma, including fractures\n- Chronic pain\n- Repetitive strain injuries\nRegistered Sport Rehabilitators are included in the General Medical Council referral guidelines and can take referrals from the wider healthcare team. Some of the patient populations they are trained to work with include:\n- Osteo and Rheumatoid Arthritis\n- Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)\n- Mental Health and Dementia\n- Heart disease\n- Peripheral artery disease\n- Falls Prevention\n- Living with Chronic Conditions\nThroughout the treatment process, patients will continue to be assessed and monitored with appropriate medical referral as needed.\nAre there any risks associated with treatment?\nSport Rehabilitators assess the risks and benefits of their treatment plans and associated interventions as part of their person-centred complete approach. The evidence-based treatment interventions recommended for you will be based upon an accurate and effective clinical assessment, as well as ongoing monitoring of your progression through rehabilitation.\nSimple examples of the types of risk management your Sport Rehabilitator will undertake are:\n- Accurately assessing the stage of healing or recovery of your injury, illness or condition and matching the graded exercise rehabilitation intervention to your status.\n- Effectively assessing the presence or probability of underlying medical conditions before recommending a manual, electrophysical or exercise-based intervention.\n- Maintaining equipment used for treatment according to manufacturer guidelines.\nYou can expect your Sport Rehabilitator to discuss the risks of individual interventions with you and refer your care on to other members of the healthcare team if it is appropriate.\nOccasionally, a treatment plan or individual intervention will have an unforeseen consequence. An example of this might be a skin reaction to a taping/strapping or other manual treatment application that a patient experiences for the first time. Or, more post-treatment soreness than would be expected, as a patient takes a step onward in their exercise rehabilitation plan. These unforeseen consequences are usually minor, and you can expect your Sport Rehabilitator to identify them and respond to adapt their approach accordingly.\nRegistration with BASRaT\nBASRaT registered Sport Rehabilitators complete an accredited three-year BSc honours degree or an accredited Masters degree along with the successful completion of more than 400 clinical hours supervised by a healthcare professional.

25	recommended tv size for bedroom location and proper mounting safety considerations metal wall	For bedrooms, smaller size TVs of 24 or 32 inches are perfect. A 24-inch TV measures 20.9 x 11.7 inches, while a 32-inch TV measures 27.9 x 15.7 inches. When mounting on a metal wall, safety considerations include selecting screws and anchors that can support the TV's specific size and weight, ensuring the bracket is properly leveled, and having a second person assist during installation to ensure secure mounting and prevent accidents.	['Many consumers consider multiple possible TV sizes when determining the size of their next TV. There is a wide range of TV sizing, spanning 24” to 75” for standard TV sizes. As a result, many find themselves considering what sizes TVs come in when looking for the best TVs in the market. To understand the different screen sizes, you should know the actual dimensions of the TV screen and the recommended viewing distance for viewers to sit away from the TV.\n- Brands manufacture smaller-sized TVs in the 24 inches, 32 inches, and 40 inches sizes, though fewer and fewer make 24-inch TVs today.\n- Consumers find displays around 55 inches, 60 inches, and 65 inches for medium-sized TVs to be the right size.\n- Larger-sized TVs measure about 65 inches, 70 inches, and 75 inches, though several models are larger than 75 inches.\nMost Common TV Sizes\nWhen buying a new TV, you should consider what size you want and what room the TV would be going in. The most common TV sizes include:\n- Smaller size TVs are perfect for a smaller room, such as the bedroom, guest room, or kitchen. These are also ideal if you have to move a TV around a lot using one of the best rolling TV stands, as it won’t weigh too much.\n- 24” – People consider 24-inch TVs to be “small” in size. The height is roughly 11.7 inches, and the width is 20.9 inches. The viewer should sit just over 3 feet away from the TV. Some manufacturers no longer make 24” displays, but if you’re set on 24 inches being the perfect size, the best 24 inch TV is still on the market.\n- 32” – These 32 Inch TVs are still considered small size. 32” TVs offer the same comfort as the 24 inches but with a slightly larger screen. These TVs typically measure around 15.7 inches tall by 27.9 inches wide. For a field of view of 30°, you may want to sit about 4.5 feet away. Many manufacturers make 32” TVs as their smallest size.\n- 40” – Many 40-inch TVs are considered to be small in size as well. These TVs typically stand about 19.6” tall by 34.9” wide, and the guidelines for a 40” TV suggest sitting approximately 2.5 feet away. You can read our Sansui 40 Inch 1080P FHD DLED TV review for a good budget option.\n- Medium size TVs are perfect for smaller living rooms and other medium-sized rooms. Many consider these TVs ideal for narrower rooms as well.\n- 55” – A 55-inch TV screen comes in at 47.9 in. wide and 27 in. tall with a viewing distance of 7.7’. Check out our guide on the best 55-inch TV for some great options.\n- 60” – Standard 60-inch widescreen TVs are approximately 29.4 inches tall with a width of 52.3 inches.

Knowing this can also help you understand how to choose a TV screen size and weight, among other considerations.\nIn that case, you may want to read our list of the best TVs for the bedroom.\nAdditionally, knowing the size and weight of the TV helps tremendously if you are going to be mounting it on the wall. Just be sure to take into consideration if it is a curved TV, as this could affect where you mount it.\nMounting a TV is also one option that is great when figuring out how to reduce glare on a TV if you are having that issue.\nCalculating TV Screen Sizes\nTo calculate the size of a TV screen, you would take the length of the diagonal, which is stated by the size in the name, and the most common aspect ratio for TVs, which is 16:9. You could then use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the approximate size of the screen. Be sure to add a few inches on each side to accommodate the TV’s bezel. You may also want to find out what is streaming tv and how it works as it will also influence the TV size you purchase.\nWhen considering image quality, personal preference, and price range, always remember that the bigger the TV size, the higher the cost. However, it does not necessarily mean that image quality will also be better with larger sizes since image resolution also plays an important role in image quality. Take a look at different television models and their features to find one that meets your needs.\nBe sure to add a few inches on each side to accommodate the TV’s bezel. You may also want to find out what is streaming tv and how it works as it will also influence the TV size you purchase.\nSTAT: According to the Society of Motion Picture & Television Engineers (SMPTE), your TV should occupy at least a 30-degree arc in your field of vision. (source)\nWhat is the viewing angle?\nViewing angle refers to the amount of your view the screen takes up. It is also referred to as the field of view.\nWhy is viewing distance significant?\nViewing distance guidelines help to prevent eye strain and other eye problems. Additionally, you can view the entire screen at these distances without having to turn your head a lot.\nWhat is the most popular TV size?\nIn 2019, the most popular TV size in North America was 65 inches.', 'A full motion TV mount is one of the best ways to enhance your television viewing experience. It allows you to tilt, swivel, and extend your TV, giving you the flexibility to find the perfect viewing angle. However, installing a full motion TV mount on a metal wall can be quite challenging. In this article, we’ll show you the step-by-step process of how to install a full motion TV mount on a metal wall, from measuring the wall to choosing the right screws and anchors for a secure installation.\nThe benefits of using a full motion TV mount\nBefore we dive into the installation process, let’s first discuss the benefits of using a full motion TV mount. As mentioned earlier, a full motion TV mount allows you to adjust the viewing angle. This flexibility means you can have a comfortable viewing experience no matter where you’re seated in the room. Additionally, a full motion TV mount can help reduce glare on the screen, which can help improve the picture quality. It also creates a sleek and modern look in your room, effectively saving space.\nAnother benefit of using a full motion TV mount is that it can help prevent neck and eye strain. With the ability to adjust the viewing angle, you can position the TV at a height and angle that is comfortable for your eyes and neck. This is especially important if you spend a lot of time watching TV or using your TV as a computer monitor. Additionally, a full motion TV mount can be a great option for families with children or pets, as it allows you to easily adjust the TV to a safe and secure position.\nTools required for the installation process\nNow that we have an idea of what a full motion TV mount is and its benefits, let’s discuss the tools you’ll need for the installation process. Here are the tools you’ll need:\n- Electric Drill\n- Tape Measure\n- Metal Screws\n- Wall Anchors\nIt’s important to note that the specific tools you’ll need may vary depending on the type of wall you’ll be mounting the TV on. For example, if you’re mounting the TV on a concrete wall, you may need a hammer drill and masonry bit in addition to the tools listed above.\nAdditionally, it’s a good idea to have a second person assist you during the installation process, especially if you’re mounting a larger TV. This can help ensure that the mount is level and secure, and can also make the process easier and safer overall.\nMeasuring the wall to determine the ideal mounting location\nThe first step in installing a full motion TV mount on a metal wall is to measure the wall for the ideal mounting location. You’ll want to find the studs in the wall first to ensure a secure installation. If you have a stud finder, use it, but if not, you can use a strong magnet to find the studs in the metal wall. Once you find them, mark the location with a pencil. After identifying the stud, decide where you want your TV to be mounted on the wall. Mark this spot on the wall with a pencil, and ensure it is level for optimal viewing.\nIt’s important to also consider the viewing angle when determining the ideal mounting location for your TV. You want to make sure that the TV is mounted at a height and angle that allows for comfortable viewing from your desired seating area. A good rule of thumb is to mount the TV at eye level when seated. Additionally, consider any potential glare or reflections from windows or lights in the room, and adjust the mounting location accordingly.\nPreparing the metal wall for mounting\nThe next step is to prepare the metal wall for mounting. This involves removing any paint or debris from the wall at the chosen location. Once the wall is clean, take the mounting bracket and position it over the mark you made earlier. Ensure that the bracket’s holes line up with the stud. Also, double-check that the bracket is level.\nAfter ensuring that the bracket is level, mark the holes on the wall with a pencil. Then, drill pilot holes into the wall at the marked locations. This will make it easier to screw in the mounting screws later on.\nOnce the pilot holes are drilled, attach the mounting bracket to the wall using screws and a screwdriver. Make sure that the screws are tight and secure. Finally, test the bracket by gently pulling on it to ensure that it is firmly attached to the wall.\nChoosing the right screws and anchors for a secure installation\nSelecting the correct screws and anchors is crucial when mounting a TV on a metal wall. The screws and anchors you choose should be able to support the weight of your TV. Therefore, you should select screws and anchors that are suitable for your specific TV’s size and weight. Using screws and anchors that are either too weak or too powerful can cause your TV to fall or damage the wall.\nWhen selecting screws and anchors, it is also important to consider the type of metal wall you are mounting your TV on. Different types of metal walls require different types of screws and anchors. For example, if you are mounting your TV on a steel stud, you will need to use self-tapping screws that are specifically designed for steel studs. On the other hand, if you are mounting your TV on a metal plate, you will need to use toggle bolts that can expand behind the plate to provide a secure hold.\nAnother factor to consider when choosing screws and anchors is the location of the installation. If you are mounting your TV in an area that is prone to earthquakes or high winds, you will need to use screws and anchors that are designed to withstand these conditions. Additionally, if you are mounting your TV in a high-traffic area, you may want to consider using screws and anchors that have a tamper-resistant design to prevent theft or vandalism.\nAttaching the mounting bracket to the metal wall\nNow that you have the right screws and anchors, attach the mounting bracket to the metal wall. Insert the screws into the holes in the bracket and tighten them until they are secure. Make sure that the bracket is level and flush against the wall.\nIt is important to note that if the metal wall is particularly thick or hard, you may need to use a drill to create pilot holes before inserting the screws. This will make the process easier and prevent the screws from bending or breaking. Additionally, if the bracket is large or heavy, it may be necessary to use multiple screws and anchors to ensure that it is securely attached to the wall.\nHow to mount the TV onto the bracket safely and securely\nWith the bracket secure, it’s time to install the TV onto the bracket. Make sure that the TV’s mounting holes match up with the holes on the bracket. Align them carefully and screw them into place. Ensure the TV is level and hangs straight. Once secured, test the strength of the mount before releasing it completely.\nIt’s important to note that the weight of the TV should be taken into consideration when choosing a bracket. Make sure the bracket is rated to hold the weight of your TV. If the bracket is not strong enough, it could result in the TV falling and causing damage or injury.\nAdditionally, it’s a good idea to have someone assist you when mounting the TV onto the bracket. This will make the process easier and safer. One person can hold the TV while the other person screws it into place. This will also help ensure that the TV is level and straight.\nTesting and adjusting the TV mount for optimal viewing angles\nNow that the TV is mounted securely, you can test the full motion mount’s capabilities by adjusting it to your ideal viewing angle. Tilt, swivel, and extend the TV as needed to get the optimal viewing angles.\nIt is important to note that the optimal viewing angle may vary depending on the room’s lighting and seating arrangement. Take some time to experiment with different angles to find the one that works best for you.\nAdditionally, if you have multiple people watching the TV from different angles, consider investing in a mount that allows for multi-angle viewing. This will ensure that everyone in the room has a comfortable viewing experience.\nTips for concealing cables and cords after installation\nThe last thing you want after installing your TV is to have unsightly cords and cables hanging down from it. To avoid this, consider using cable sleeves or conduits to conceal the cords and provide a more organized look. Alternatively, you may want to consider hiring an electrician to install power outlets behind the TV to hide the cords.\nCommon mistakes to avoid during installation\nAvoid common mistakes during installation by ensuring that you have the right tools, screws and anchors, and that the TV is level. Check the capabilities of your bracket and TV before ensuring that your chosen screw and wall anchors are sufficient. Additionally, don’t tilt the TV too far, which could cause it to become unbalanced and fall.\nTroubleshooting tips in case of mounting issues\nIn some cases, certain complications may arise during installation. Here are some troubleshooting tips to follow to fix mounting issues:\n- If your TV is not level, adjust it accordingly.\n- If the bracket is crooked, remove it from the wall, and remount it after determining the correct mounting location.\n- If the screws do not seem to be going into the wall material securely, consider using larger ones or different anchors.\nFrequently asked questions about full motion TV mounts on metal walls\nHere are some frequently asked questions.\n- Q: Can full motion TV mounts be placed on any type of wall?\n- A: No, full motion TV mounts should be installed on walls strong enough to support the weight and with mounting spaces well-positioned.\n- Q: Will a full motion TV mount damage the wall?\n- A: A correctly installed full motion TV mount should not cause any damage to the wall. By following the installation guidelines and choosing the correct screws and anchors, you can avoid damage efficiently.\nConclusion: Enjoy your newly installed full motion TV mount on a metal wall!\nInstalling a full motion TV mount on a metal wall can be challenging, but by following the steps mentioned above, the process should be more comfortable. Remember that selecting the appropriate tools, screws, and anchors are essential. Doing so ensures a secure installation that can withstand the weight of the TV. Making sure the TV is level before releasing it completely is vital to avoid mishaps. Lastly, don’t forget to conceal any visible cables or cords for a cleaner look. Complete installation of your full motion TV mount and sit back and enjoy your new viewing experience from your couch or bed on your beautifully mounted TV.']	['<urn:uuid:4bf48024-a2f3-483e-b40b-9849e5625d38>', '<urn:uuid:f7b365c7-925f-4e7f-87b9-2059c4a66309>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	13	72	3073
26	I want to know who's responsible when someone gets sick from asbestos in Pennsylvania, and what kinds of breathing problems show up in chest x-rays?	Multiple entities can be held responsible for asbestos exposure in Pennsylvania: companies that manufactured asbestos products, businesses that used these products, and sometimes even the government if they failed to warn about dangers. Regarding chest x-rays, they can show pleural effusion (fluid around the lungs), which may persist on x-rays even after treatment due to proteins that take longer for the body to remove. The shadows of pleural effusions on x-rays may remain visible longer than the actual fluid itself.	"['Pennsylvania Asbestos Regulating Agencies\nPennsylvania asbestos regulating agencies were necessitated by the dangers posed by asbestos exposure. After it was determined that asbestos exposure could lead to many serious health problems, Pennsylvania mesothelioma and asbestos laws were enacted. Along with them, Pennsylvania asbestos regulating agencies were tasked with enforcing these laws.\nThese agencies work to identify potential sources of exposure and ensure that these sources are properly mitigated to protect workers, residents, and others who may be at risk. In addition, these agencies also work to provide information and resources to those exposed to asbestos so that they can get the help they need.\nAsbestos regulating agencies include the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the Pennsylvania Department of Health, and the Pennsylvania Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The EPA also has an asbestos program, which works with state and local agencies to ensure that asbestos is properly managed.\nThe DEP is responsible for ensuring that asbestos-containing materials are properly disposed of and that public water supplies are not contaminated with asbestos. The Department of Health conducts surveillance and epidemiological studies on the health effects of asbestos exposure, provides information about the risks of exposure and operates a statewide registry of people who have been exposed to asbestos.\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration is responsible for enforcing occupational safety and health standards related to asbestos exposure. Ultimately, these agencies work together to protect the public from the dangers of asbestos exposure.\nWhen Was Asbestos Banned in Pennsylvania?\nWhile asbestos was not officially banned in Pennsylvania until 1989, its use had been declining since the early 1970s. This is due to a number of factors, including public awareness of the health risks associated with asbestos exposure and the availability of alternative materials that are less dangerous to work with. Asbestos was once widely used in various industries; however, its dangers are now well-known, and it is no longer used in new construction projects. Regardless, asbestos may still be used in some older buildings and in projects where the state specifically approves its use.\nPennsylvania Asbestos Regulations\nThere are several Pennsylvania statutes that provide for asbestos regulations in the state. The most notable is the Pennsylvania Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act enacted in 1986. This Act requires that all public and private buildings be inspected for asbestos and that a management plan is put in place to address any asbestos hazards that are found. The Act also requires the removal of asbestos-containing materials from all public and private buildings. In addition, the Act requires the reporting of asbestos exposure to the Pennsylvania Department of Health.\nAnother important statute is the Pennsylvania Asbestos Control Act, enacted in 1984. This Act requires the identification and control of asbestos-containing materials in all public and private buildings. It also requires the removal of asbestos-containing materials from all public and private buildings.\nYet another statute is the Pennsylvania Clean Indoor Air Act, which was enacted in 2008. This Act requires that all public and private buildings be smoke-free and ACM free.\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Health also has many regulations pertaining to asbestos. These regulations require reporting asbestos exposure, removing asbestos-containing materials from all public and private buildings, and controlling asbestos-containing materials in all public and private buildings.\nThese statutes and regulations are essential in protecting the public from the dangers of asbestos exposure.\nWhat is the Role of Asbestos Regulators in Pennsylvania?\nThe following are some essential roles that asbestos regulators play in Pennsylvania:\n- They ensure that all facilities and buildings are free of asbestos contamination.\n- They develop and implement regulations to protect the public from asbestos exposure.\n- They conduct inspections of facilities and buildings to ensure compliance with asbestos regulations.\n- They investigate complaints of asbestos exposure and take appropriate action to protect the public.\n- They provide information and education to the public about asbestos and its dangers.\n- They work with other state and federal agencies to ensure a coordinated response to asbestos contamination.\nAsbestos Regulatory Organizations in Pennsylvania\nSeveral organizations in Pennsylvania work to regulate asbestos and protect public health. These organizations include the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH), and the EPA.\nThe DEP is responsible for ensuring that asbestos-containing materials are properly disposed of and that businesses comply with state regulations. The DOH is responsible for researching the health effects of asbestos exposure and providing information to the public about how to protect themselves from exposure. The EPA regulates asbestos-containing products and has developed strict guidelines for safe use.\nWhat is Pennsylvania OSHA\'s Role with Asbestos?\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for protecting workers from asbestos exposure. In Pennsylvania, OSHA works closely with the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry\'s Bureau of Labor Standards to ensure that workers are protected from asbestos exposure. Both of these organizations have their regulations and procedures for dealing with asbestos.\nOSHA\'s role is to ensure that employers comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) and its regulations. The OSH Act contains a general duty clause that requires employers to provide a safe and healthful workplace for their employees. In addition, the Act contains specific provisions that address asbestos exposure.\nThe OSH Act requires employers to take steps to prevent workers from being exposed to asbestos. Employers must also provide workers with information about the hazards of asbestos and how to protect themselves.\nIn addition to the OSH Act, OSHA has issued a regulation requiring employers to have an asbestos management plan. The regulation requires employers to identify asbestos-containing materials in their workplace and take steps to control the exposure of workers to these materials.\nPennsylvania has its own asbestos laws and regulations that are administered by the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry\'s Bureau of Labor Standards. These laws and regulations are similar to OSHA\'s, but they may differ in some respects.\nFor example, the Pennsylvania Asbestos Control Act requires employers to notify the Bureau of Labor Standards when they suspect that asbestos is present in their workplace. The notification must include information about the location of the asbestos and the type of work that will be done there.\nThe Department of Labor and Industry\'s Bureau of Labor Standards also has the authority to issue citations and penalties for violations of the asbestos laws and regulations.\nPennsylvania OSHA Asbestos Regulations\nPennsylvania\'s OSHA asbestos regulations are designed to protect workers from exposure to asbestos. The regulations require businesses to take steps to control the release of asbestos into the air, and provide for penalties for violations of the regulations. They also require businesses to provide training for workers who may be exposed to asbestos.\nTo comply with the regulations, businesses must:\n- Identify and label all asbestos-containing materials\n- Post warning signs in areas where asbestos is present\n- Keep work areas clean and free of dust\n- Use wet methods to control dust when working with asbestos-containing materials\n- Provide training for workers who may be exposed to asbestos\n- Use personal protective equipment when working with asbestos-containing materials.\nTo comply with Pennsylvania\'s OSHA asbestos regulations, businesses must also take steps to control the release of asbestos into the air. This can be done by using asbestos-containing materials in a way that minimizes the release of asbestos fibers or by using substitutes for asbestos-containing materials.\nPenalties for violating Pennsylvania\'s OSHA asbestos regulations can include fines and imprisonment. Violations of the regulations can also result in civil liability.\nWhen and How to Contact Pennsylvania OSHA\nSince the OSHA is responsible for ensuring safe and healthful working conditions for workers in the United States, Pennsylvania employees who have concerns about their workplace safety and health are encouraged to contact the OSHA.\nWhen employees in Pennsylvania have concerns about their workplace safety and health, they are encouraged to contact the OSHA by phone at (800) 321-6742 or by visiting the website. The OSHA will then investigate the workplace to see if there are any health or safety hazards present. If the OSHA finds that there are indeed health or safety hazards present, they will take steps to correct the situation and help ensure that employees are protected from harm.\nWhat is the EPA\'s Role with Asbestos in Pennsylvania?\nThe EPA\'s (Environmental Protection Agency) role with asbestos is to make sure that this dangerous substance is properly managed and disposed of. The EPA has strict regulations in place regarding the use, storage, and disposal of asbestos-containing materials.\nThe EPA has put in place regulations to minimize the risk of exposure to asbestos. These regulations require that contractors who work with asbestos-containing materials take special precautions to avoid releasing fibers into the air. For example, they must wet the materials before disturbing them, and they must use vacuums with HEPA filters to clean up any dust that is generated.\nWhat is the Difference Between OSHA and EPA in Pennsylvania?\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are both federal agencies that are responsible for protecting worker safety and health. In Pennsylvania, OSHA is responsible for enforcing occupational safety and health standards, while the EPA is responsible for protecting the environment from pollution.\nBoth OSHA and the EPA have different regulations that employers must follow in order to ensure the safety of their employees. For example, OSHA requires employers to provide their employees with a safe work environment, while the EPA requires employers to control environmental pollutants.\nWhile both agencies are responsible for protecting workers, they have different jurisdictions. OSHA is responsible for enforcing safety and health standards in the workplace, while the EPA is responsible for protecting the environment from pollution.\nWhat is the NIOSH\'s Role with Asbestos in Pennsylvania?\nThe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) researches and recommends the prevention of work-related injuries and illnesses. This includes those caused by exposure to asbestos.\nPennsylvania has its own set of regulations regarding asbestos exposure in the workplace. These regulations are based on NIOSH recommendations. Employers must follow these regulations to protect their employees from asbestos exposure.\nThe regulations of NIOSH are as follows:\n- Employers must equip employees with information about the dangers of asbestos exposure.\n- Employers must provide their employees with training on how to work with or around asbestos safely.\n- Employers must provide personal protective equipment to their employees while working with asbestos\n- Employers must monitor their employees\' exposure to asbestos.\n- Employers must take measures to control employee exposure to asbestos.\nWho is Responsible for Asbestos Exposure in Pennsylvania?\nThere are several different entities that may be held responsible for asbestos exposure in Pennsylvania. These include companies that manufactured or sold asbestos-containing products, businesses that used those products, and even the government.\nCompanies That Manufactured Asbestos Products\nSeveral companies manufactured asbestos-containing products, such as insulation, pipe covering, and fireproofing material. Most of these companies knew of the dangers of asbestos exposure but failed to warn consumers or take adequate precautions to protect workers. Hence, they can be held liable for the injuries and illnesses caused by their products.\nBusinesses That Used Asbestos Products\nMany businesses use asbestos-containing products in their buildings or in their industrial operations. These businesses may also be held liable for the injuries and illnesses caused by exposure to asbestos. In most cases, the companies that manufactured the asbestos products may also be held responsible for the injuries caused by those products.\nIn some cases, the government may also be held responsible for asbestos exposure. This is most likely to occur when the government knew of the dangers of asbestos but failed to warn the public or take adequate precautions to protect workers.\nIndividuals Who Are Exposed to Asbestos\nIn some cases, individuals who are exposed to asbestos may also be held liable for their injuries. This is most likely to occur when the individual knew of the dangers of asbestos but failed to take adequate precautions to protect themselves or others.\nHow to Dispose of Asbestos Containing Material in Pennsylvania\nIn Pennsylvania, there are specific guidelines that must be followed in order to ensure that ACM is disposed of in a way that protects public health and the environment.\nThe first step is to have any ACM evaluated by a certified asbestos inspector. Once the ACM has been inspected, it must be double-bagged in 6-mil thick plastic bags before it can be taken to a disposal site.\nThere are several types of disposal sites that are approved for ACM in Pennsylvania:\nClass I landfills: These are specially designed landfill cells that have a minimum 3-foot thick clay liner and a leachate collection system. Class I landfills are the only disposal site that can accept friable ACM (materials that can be easily crumbled or pulverized by hand).\nClass II landfills: These landfill cells also have a clay liner and leachate collection system, but they\'re not designed to accept friable ACM. Class II landfills can only accept non-friable ACM that has been double-bagged in 6-mil thick plastic bags.\nIncinerators: Two types of incinerators are approved for disposing of ACM in Pennsylvania: rotary kiln incinerators and fluid bed incinerators.\nRotary kiln incinerators must meet certain emissions standards, while fluid bed incinerators must have a scrubber system to control emissions.\nCement kilns: Cement kilns are also approved for disposing of ACM, as long as the material is sent through the kiln when it\'s operating at its maximum temperature.\nACM disposal sites must be licensed by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). A list of licensed disposal sites can be found on the DEP website.\nWhen transporting ACM to a disposal site, it is essential to follow all applicable regulations, including those governing the labeling and packaging of hazardous materials. ACM must be clearly labeled with the words ""Asbestos Waste"" and the type of ACM ( friable or non-friable). The waste must also be packaged in a way that will prevent it from leaking or becoming damaged during transport.\nFurther information on how to safely dispose of ACM in Pennsylvania can be obtained from the Pennsylvania DEP at (717) 787-7382.', 'Doctor insights on:\nWhat Are The Key Symptoms Of Pleural Effusion\nShortness of breath: The key symptom of a pleural effusion is shortness of breath ...

27	As someone who cares about equal access to nature, I'm wondering how cities are working to make sure everyone can benefit from urban green spaces, especially those who can't afford expensive programs?	This is a significant challenge that cities are actively working to address. Currently, many enriching nature experiences, including outdoor education programs, tend to be costly and therefore less accessible to low-income families. For instance, programs like Mother Earth School in Portland must charge tuition to operate, which can limit access. Cities and organizations are trying to address this through several approaches: assessing how green infrastructure management affects vulnerable populations, developing more equitable policies and financial mechanisms, and seeking private funding to offer scholarships and reduce program costs. The goal is to ensure that the benefits of urban nature - from recreational opportunities to climate resilience - are accessible to all community members regardless of their economic status.	['This is a new series of posts in which I interview Portland personalities that are making a difference in connecting children of this region to nature. Richard Louv, the premier voice in the children and nature movement, has written several times about our natureful city. In Last Child in the Woods, he remarked on Portland’s Greenspaces program’s “call for the creation of a regional system of parks, natural areas, greenways, and trails for both wildlife and people;” PSU students’ research on possible greenroof design in downtown; and the 40-Mile Loop. In The Nature Principle, Louv commented on research in Portland on the health benefits of nature (outdoor “prescriptions”); profiled a teacher who worked as an assistant for a study of small mammals in an urban green space (Marshall Park); described Mike Houck’s work to make room for nature in a big city at a time when the consensus was that nature and wildlife were elsewhere, not within where people dwell; and how the Tualatin River National Wildlife Refuge provides access to nature via the bus system. There are other mentions of Portland, too. Patrick, Catherine, and I feel lucky to live in a city that values what the Earth gives to it. Moreover, we feel privileged to share this city with folks who strive to not only instill a love of nature into its citizens’ minds and hearts, but in providing better access to that nature.\nPlease contact me at firstname.lastname@example.org if you have a suggestion for someone to be interviewed for this series.\nToday I talk to Kelly Hogan, co-founder at Mother Earth School.\nHi Kelly, welcome to Exploring Portland’s Natural Areas. Would you please share with us your background – education, jobs, etc. that relate to nature in some way?\nI am the co-founder of Mother Earth School, an all-outdoor preschool, kindergarten, 1st & 2nd grade located on forested urban farms in SE and SW Portland. We are about to start our 6th year of programming and we just completed our 5th year of summer camps that serve ages 4-12, including rite of passage work with the pre-teenagers. I have completed rite of passage training with an organization called Rite of Passage Journeys, an Art of Mentoring training at the Wilderness Awareness School, I participated in the Wilderness Survival immersion program through Trackers NW, I have my Waldorf teaching certificate and a Permaculture Design certificate. I lived and volunteered at Tryon Life Community Farm sustainability education center (the site of our early childhood programs) for 5 years where I focused on homesteading skills (specifically animal husbandry).\nDescribe for us how you connect Portland kids to nature. Tell us about your programs.\nI teach preschool at Mother Earth School. The programs at Mother Earth School are outdoor immersion experiences year-round that focus on homesteading skills, nature survival skills, community building, sensory integration and forest exploration. The children are nurtured in an environment full of awe, discovery, connectedness, adventure and celebration. We honor the seasons through song, storytelling, puppetry, craft projects, skill building and play. This relationship that the children develop with the natural world is the foundation of a future generation of environmental advocates. The mission of Mother Earth School is to support the healing of humanity by transforming education with reverence to the wisdom inherent in nature.\nDo you have any moments in nature from your childhood that left an impression on you?\nI grew up playing outside every day in the forest behind my house. All of my childhood memories center around nature. I have one very clear memory of running through my yard, fully immersed in an imaginative experience. Then, all of a sudden, it was as if I “snapped out of it” and caught a glimpse of my surroundings from a perspective that was not based in imagination. I stopped for a moment, glanced around at the forest which in that moment looked simply like scenery, and then made the conscious decision to re-enter my imaginary world, in which I was much more connected to the essence of what was around me, rather than just how things looked. It is a difficult moment to describe in words, but is quite a profound look at the level of engagement of the “child’s mind”. I want to nurture that in children and encourage its expression.\nDo you have children yourself? If so, tell me about their relationship to nature.\nI have 2 children. Talon is 12 and Yarrow is 10. They also grew up engaged in outdoor adventures and playing freely in nature. My son is a pre-teen and currently prefers skateboarding and basketball to hiking or fishing, but he doesn’t hesitate to spend a week camping or a day rafting. My daughter is constantly making herbal remedies (mostly in the form of tea). She loves plants and animals and enthusiastically participates in goat milking and other types of animal tending. She writes songs and stories about homesteading and loves to come with me to primitive skills gatherings throughout the year.\nDescribe for us something about Portland’s focus on nature that you think is valuable for the city’s youth.\nI love the diversity in the types of programming offered for youth in the Portland area! Mother Earth School offers an experience that is media-free, dreamy (in a good way!!) and idyllic whereas Trackers uses media trends to offer programs that are attractive to children that might otherwise prefer playing video games. I value the experiences on both ends of the spectrum, as well as everything in-between. We get contacted almost every week by an individual, school or organization that is looking for guidance in how to incorporate more nature into their programming. From public school garden classes and higher education credits for outdoor education training, to child care facilities that are committing to using all-natural materials, it is truly heartening to see that this movement is so quickly permeating the Portland area (and beyond!).\nIs there anything missing that you would like to see happen in Portland?\nI would like to see more access to these types of experiences for low-income families. Mother Earth School is a tuition-based school (necessarily so, because in order to be a registered school with public funding, we would have to change aspects of what is so foundational to our educational philosophy and practices). With more private funding, we would be able to reduce our tuition as well as to offer scholarships to families that can’t afford to pay for school. It seems that so many enriching experiences are costly, including nature immersion, which is really ironic. Either the government and insurance sectors are going to have to take a leap of faith, or the movement needs more people willing to invest money to support the accessibility of connecting consistently with nature as a means of education.\nDo you have any advice for parents looking to connect their kids to nature?\nYes, my advise is to prioritize it. It is easy for the busyness of urban life to displace outdoor experiences to occasional weekend outings (especially in the rainy season, which is most of the year in this area). Invest in some sturdy outerwear and long underwear (utilize the amazing second-hand market here in Portland to keep costs low) and play outside along with your children! P.S. – adults, it is still fun to splash in puddles and climb trees!! :)\nWhat is you favorite natural space in our city?\nI absolutely adore Tryon Creek State Park. It is such a magical forest that is so appreciated by its patrons that I feel like it is bursting with joy. Mother Earth School has special names for so many of the places that we love there. One of our favorites is the ‘owl tree’ where baby barred owls are born every spring. The baby owls are actually flirtatious!! The parents of our school children will hear all about the baby owls and want to take a walk after school to see the owl family. They will ask me for directions to the tree and all I have to say is “your child can show you the way” (and they will likely also introduce their parents to all the edible plants along the way as well).\nThank you for sharing your thoughts, Kelly! Patrick is just about to start first grade. Perhaps when Afton goes to preschool (she’s not even two weeks old yet!), she will go to Mother Earth School.', 'Sustainable, Livable CitiesSupporting resilient, sustainable, and equitable cities through nature-based solutions\nTHE CHALLENGEThe Challenge: Around the world, city leaders are turning towards nature-based solutions to build cities that are more livable and resilient to climate and health risks. Globally, we need more practice and research on urban ecosystem services to highlight when and how urban nature can contribute to safer, more equitable cities. OUR SOLUTIONOur Solution: Our work aims to demonstrate the power and value of nature to manage urban challenges. We review existing knowledge, develop tools to quantify urban ecosystem services, and co-produce information highlighting how natural infrastructure benefits people in complex urban systems. OUTCOMESOutcomes: Acting locally, regionally, and globally, we are co-developing innovative approaches and policies that explore nature-based urban solutions and promote sustainable, livable cities. We are implementing pilot projects in the U.S. and in China and working with partners to learn about opportunities around the world (in particular in the Global South).\nBy 2050, there will be 9 billion people on Earth, and a staggering 75 percent of them will live in cities. Ongoing urbanization and rising global prosperity will combine to increase the size and density of the world’s cities, forcing municipal leaders to make hard choices in the funding and management of both built and natural infrastructure.\nClimate change and associated risks, together with health threats and economic insecurity, press the urban community to find innovative solutions to build livable and resilient cities. Heat waves are more frequent and intense. Sea levels are rising, and changes in precipitation patterns may increase the risk of coastal and riparian flooding or potentially overwhelm many urban stormwater systems. A changing climate may also alter the spread of mosquito-borne infectious diseases in urban areas, and drier climates may put other cities at risk of catastrophic wildfire.\nHumans have already made tremendous investments in the buildings, transportation, water and energy systems that sustain urban communities. However, growing cities need to plan for investing in and maintaining infrastructure at an unprecedented rate, while also meeting the mounting challenge of climate adaptation. NatCap works to fill the gaps in knowledge and contribute tools that leverage the full potential of nature in building resilient cities.\nSan Francisco Resiliency Planning\nTo increase the resilience of San Francisco Bay Area coastlines and communities to sea-level rise, we include natural infrastructure (native landscape, river systems, etc.) in climate adaptation planning. Working with the Bay Area Regional Council (BARC), Bay Area Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC), and San Mateo County, we implemented in-depth scoping with decision-makers to balance research and stakeholder needs, building on other efforts to improve coastal community resilience in the Bay Area. We have found that additional research on the co-benefits of nature-based solutions and specific urban ecosystem services, including but not limited to coastal protection, nature-based recreation, and stormwater management, have the potential to guide ongoing design and policy decisions.\n“Cities around the world need to know how to quantify the benefits that nature provides, so that they can choose to incorporate nature appropriately into their city, leading to a resilient, healthy, more verdant urban world”.\nGlobal Cities Lead, The Nature Conservancy\nDemonstrating the power—and value—of nature can help cities manage the challenges they face.\nNature offers its own infrastructure and can help cities mitigate these consequences, delivering vital services that are cost-effective and resilient to disruption.\nOur work within the Livable Cities program focuses on three areas:\nWe assess the distributional consequences of green infrastructure management (i.e. considering policies, institutions and diverse values) that affect vulnerable populations and marginalized communities.\nWe co-produce innovative approaches, policies and financial mechanisms with practitioners across local, regional, and global scales that explore nature-based urban solutions and promote sustainable, livable cities.\nA growing number of influential urban networks and partners—TNC’s Global Cities program, the Rockefeller Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities or 100RC, ICLEI, C40, and others—have embraced the protection and restoration benefits of natural infrastructure as a means to promote more sustainable and livable cities. We are establishing partnerships to co-produce innovative approaches, policies and financial mechanisms with practitioners across local, regional, and global scales that explore nature-based urban solutions and promote sustainable, livable cities. Our pilot projects are in the U.S. and in China and we are working with partners to learn from other geographies (in particular in the Global South).\nNatural Capital of Golf Courses\nThe US loves golf. There are approximately 16,000 golf courses in the USA, spread across a variety of social and ecological contexts; urban to rural, forest to swamp, grassland to desert. Economically, golf courses contribute billions of dollars to the economy and create jobs for local communities. Environmentally, golf courses require inputs of water, nutrients and pesticides and can be taxing. While these immediate, direct costs and benefits are fairly well-understood, the indirect contribution of golf courses to landscape and the public value is not as well-understood: What are the ecosystem service values of golf courses to their surrounding community? How do the biophysical drivers of ecosystem services affect the golf experience? We launched a collaborative project to explore environmental and public values associated with golf courses in urban areas and explore these important questions further.\nUsing social media to understand drivers of urban park visitation in the Twin Cities, MN\nWe developed and tested an approach for using geotagged social media data from the websites Flickr and Twitter to look at park visitation in the Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA. Looking at what characteristics (i.e. water features, trail networks) drive patterns of visitation to a city’s green space can help inform local and regional park planners. We found that Twin Cities parks with nearby water features, more amenities, greater accessibility from trails, and located within more densely populated neighborhoods are associated with higher rates of visitation. This analysis demonstrated that using targeted information about user behavior and preferences available from social media data can rapidly assess park use at a lower cost than traditional surveys. It is a flexible tool and has the potential to inform public green space management in urban areas wherever social media data is widely available.\nAn Update on NatCap’s Livable Cities Program By Marie Donahue | October 2017 Photo credit: https://pixabay.com/ Supporting the development of livable cities has been a core component of NatCap’s strategic engagement and research in recent years, and for good reason....\nExploring the Natural Capital Value of Golf Courses By Marie Donahue | October 2017 Photo credit: https://pixabay.com/ If you randomly ask someone on a city street to describe the game of golf, odds are good that even someone unfamiliar with the nuances of the game...\nNotes from informal urban settlements in Fiji and Indonesia By Anne Guerry | October 2017 An informal settlement before (left) and after (right) proposed RISE project interventions that include toilets, communal septic tanks, and wetlands for flood reduction and...\nPlease contact Sustainable, Livable Cities Outcome Lead Perrine Hamel (email@example.com) for more information.\nA draft Working Vision for the Sustainable, Livable Cities Program (2017) is available for download.']	['<urn:uuid:88783ea9-0a02-400b-9567-a61dfe38d77b>', '<urn:uuid:9773d127-b7a8-48e7-a75d-99b0027cce31>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	32	117	2569
28	dive reel underwater navigation practice techniques blindfolded search patterns surface	To practice dive reel skills on land, use a fixed point (like a fence or tree) as an anchor and lay line across the yard. Practice maintaining proper line tension, changing direction, tying off lines, and reeling back to the spool. You can also practice placing directional markers and holding the reel and flashlight in the same hand. For advanced practice, try following your laid line back to the start point while blindfolded (with a safety buddy). This skill is particularly important for low visibility diving, wreck penetrations, and cavern diving.	['In our recent post, Improve Your Diving by Practicing These Skills on Land Part 1, we discussed navigation, fitness, and photography. But wait – there’s more! Part 2 goes over more things you can practice on land that will enhance your time underwater.\nDive Reels and Lines\nIf you have a new dive reel then you’ll want to get familiar with your new gadget on land before taking it underwater. Use a fixed point – like a fence, tree or even your car bumper – as an anchor point and lay line across the front yard. Get a feel for the tension you need to keep the line taut. Change direction and get into the habit of tying off your line as you do so. Master the motion of reeling it back to the spool. Place directional markers, and practice holding the reel and flashlight in the same hand.\nOnce you’ve smoothed your technique, try placing your line and then following it back to your start point using a blindfold (and a buddy to keep you safe).Being competent and quick with your reel and line will be an essential skill if you’re planning to dive in low visibility areas or if you’re planning wreck penetrations or cavern diving.\nSearch and Recovery skills\nPractice knot tying on the surface so the process becomes automatic. The free PADI App includes animations to help you learn different knots; keep a couple of pieces of rope in your dive bag or car and test yourself when you have a few minutes each day. The faster you can tie off your dive flag, the more time you can spend diving – and a properly-tied knot on your lift bag will help keep recovered objects safe and secure.\nWhen planning a search and recovery dive, a dry run on the surface is an excellent way to enhance your effort. Go to an open space with a long rope. Tie your rope to a tent stake and use it as your fixed reference point. Practice a circular search pattern by walking in a circle around your fixed point. Each time you complete the circle, go a little further out from the center. You can also use the rope to practice jackstay patterns, or, if you don’t have rope to hand, practice your compass work with some U search pattern or Expanding square searches. Try asking a friend to ‘hide’ some objects along the way to see how quickly you can find each one.\nEFR and Rescue Practice\nThe Emergency First Response course helps you learn how to deal with emergency situations including CPR and First Aid techniques. But even with refresher courses, these skills quickly fade over time, so make sure you keep practicing them at every opportunity so that if the worst should happen, you’re prepared and confident to help. When you regularly practice CPR and first aid on land, knowing what to do in an emergency will become automatic.\nYou can practice CPR on resuscitation dolls if you have them available – otherwise even everyday objects such as pillows or cushions can be used (remember, never practice CPR on a breathing person). Brush up your bandaging skills by practicing on your friends and family, try using your fin to make a splint, and role-play full emergency situations.\nMental imagery can be used to improve your diving. When you repeatedly imagine yourself executing the perfect dive, you condition your neural pathways to do so. It makes an impact on your nervous system because your brain benefits from familiarization. Reflect on past experiences – visualize how you could improve your dive next time. Think about different outcomes of various diving scenarios, and imagine how you would respond to each one. By mentally rehearsing your reactions you’ll build up a mental ‘script’ to help guide you on your real dives.\nVisualization takes less effort than the exercise regime we mentioned in Part 1 and it’s easy to fit into your daily routine – 5 minutes at bedtime, commuting to work, even on the plane heading to your scuba vacation!\nAlthough technically not a ‘dive skill’, using your dry time to research and expand your diving knowledge will almost certainly improve your time underwater.\nFind out everything you can about dive sites and wrecks you’re planning to dive so that you can navigate and locate points of interest with ease. Create a list of critters you want to spot on your next trip and identify the ones you’ve already found. Re-read your PADI course manuals to brush up on your dive theory and remind yourself about core skills and techniques. Maintain and use your logbook as a research tool – what equipment did you use and what weight did you need? What did you find in a particular dive site? What was the best time for diving there?\nBy arming yourself with relevant scuba knowledge, you’ll have a wider library from which to draw from to help enrich your future diving experiences.\nApart from practicing these dive skills, time on the surface is also a good opportunity to update your logbook, maintain your equipment and start planning your next trip. What other surface activities do you recommend to improve your scuba skills?']	['<urn:uuid:c8980b2e-6ec0-449e-9c9a-050616e565f3>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	10	91	873
29	ghana traditional cloth communication purpose	The Akan people of Ghana used cloth not only for personal adornment but also as a medium of communication. Specifically, Adinkra cloth is encoded with visual symbols that represent popular proverbs or maxims, record historical events, and express particular attitudes or behaviors, with these symbols having shared meanings within the society.	"['Jan 25, 2016\nThe Akan of Ghana have used cloth not only for personal adornment but also as a medium of communication. Adinkra cloth is one such cloth that encoded with visual symbols which represent popular proverbs or maxims, record historical events, and/or express particular attitudes or behaviours and have shared meanings in the society.\nA view suggests that the art of weaving cloth and printing the adinkra cloth was known in Denkyira and other Akan areas even before the ""Osa-nti"" which occurred around 1700. This war ended the rule of the Denkyira over the Asante, and also gave rise to the Asante kingdom. The Asante, according to this explanation, learned the art of weaving and printing cloth from the Denkyira craftsmen and specialists who either defected or were captured during the war (Agyeman-Duah, n.d. no. 13). Wilks (1975, p. 456) writes: ""The first and second Asokwahenes, Nuamoa and his full brother Akwadan, were among the many Denkyira who voluntarily transferred their allegiance to Osei Tutu in the late seventeenth century."" When Akwadan defected he was said to have carried a trumpet that was made of gold. This must refer to a gilded abentia - gilded state horn (called nkrawoben).\nThese Denkyira people are said to have introduced several innovations not only in textile and other crafts but also in government and military organization. The Denkyira hypothesis is buttressed by the fact that a section of the Bonwire township is named Denkyira for the Denkyira people who either defected or were captured during the ""Osa-nti"" war. Oral history as told to me by several informants from Bonwire pointed out that the Denkyira crafts people were settled here and other parts of Kwabere to ply their trade.\nIf one accepted this hypothesis, then the 1818 Gyaman war must have resulted in bringing to Asokwa Gyaman war captives who might have introduced additional technological improvements (e.g., the use of carved apakyiwa in stamping (as compared to the use of feathers in the painting technique that Bowdich mentions in his 1819 book) in the textile industry. In the adinkra production process, Asokwa informants maintained that it was Nana Adinkra\'s son, Apau (or Apaa) who introduced innovations such as the use of calabash for carving out the stamps . He is also believed to have introduced the very first symbol (adwini kane), adinkrahene (king of the adinkra symbols). He is remembered and honored with the symbol Adinkraba Apau (Apau, Son of Adinkra). Other symbols are believed to have been copied from the carved column (sekyedua) of the stool and other regalia of Nana Adinkra of Gyaman (Kyerematen, 1964). This hypothesis is problematic because the Bowdich collection of 1817 has the adinkrahene symbol that is believed to have been introduced by Nana Adinkra\'s son.\nAsokwa adinkra cloth producers are noted for designing and printing adinkra cloths for Asante royal houses, including Manhyia. The ""Osa-nti"" War which occurred around 1700 is believed to have brought Denkyira defectors or captives that included craftsmen and specialists that brought adinkra cloth printing to the Asantes (Agyeman-Duah, n.d. no. 13). Wilks (1975, p. 456) writes:\n""The first and second Asokwahenes, Nuamoa and his full brother Akwadan, were among the many Denkyira who voluntarily transferred their allegiance to Osei Tutu in the late seventeenth century.""\nClick here to visit gallery']"	['<urn:uuid:8265f043-99cc-46a9-adfe-5475ee99523b>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	5	51	549
30	automatic scoring system maple aleks which more human input	Maple's essay grading system requires more human input as it needs hundreds of human-scored essays to build its scoring model and works best as an advisory tool alongside human graders. ALEKS operates more independently, with fully online explanations, practice, and feedback, requiring minimal human intervention beyond initial setup and supervision of the first assessment.	"['Maple 17 includes a new package for linguistic analysis and grading of essays. The ability for a computer to successfully grade essays is inherently mathematical. Given a set of essays that have already been graded by hand, the computer looks for patterns in the essays and tries to weight them according to the given scores. Things like key words, sentence structure, length, and variation of words tend to have a significant correlation to good or bad scores. Maple\'s scoring model can pick from up to 20 algorithms, each measuring dozens of properties to formulate a model that can be used to predict scores for new essays.\nThe EssayTools package contains functions for:\nPlagiarism detection and similarity comparisons\nAnalysis of English word forms and sentence reduction\nThe grading commands are best used in an advisory capacity. They are great for giving insight into student responses for homework and practice. They are also effective as a double-check in high-stakes testing where many markers are utilized. For example, any essay where the human score disagrees with the computer score by more than one or two points could be flagged and re-graded by an independent human.\nTo get good predictions it is best to seed your model with hundreds of scored essays. The more the better. For the purposes of this overview, we will use examples that have insufficient data in order to illustrate the form of the commands as well as some of the pitfalls and limitations of technology like this.\nConsider a wide open short-answer question like ""Why is the sky blue?"". Gather several responses and put them in an array. Here, we call the array Answers. Provide a second array with a grade for each of the answers. In this example, we call the second array Scores. In practice, these responses and grades could be read in from a .csv file using one of the ImportVector or ExcelTools:-Import commands.\nQuestion := ""Why is the sky blue?"":\nAnswers := Array(): Scores := Array():\n""The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering.

Your eye sees these reflected wavelengths as blue."":\nOther EssayTools commands can be used to get an idea of what goes on behind the scenes. First, let\'s look at the words that occur with high frequency in the model answers.\nWordUse(Answers, showcount, mincount = 3);\nLet\'s use some of these high-frequency words to form nonsense answers.\nScore(""The is of blue light sky in scattered air."", model);\nScore(""Blue light sky scattered air molecules."", model);\nThis model gives a disproportionate weight to the use of the word, ""molecules"", which always appears in good answers, but does not appear in low-scoring answers. This emphasizes the need to have a large sample of data to build the model with.\nReduction techniques can be used to simplify the essay by dropping unimportant words, coalescing words with similar meaning, and splitting the response into smaller idea-phrases.\nModifiedResponse := Reduce(NewResponse);\nModifiedResponse:=blue violet wavelength hand be absorbed gas molecule scatter sky,eye see reflected wavelength blue\nAn important tool in this process is the use of word lemmas.\nKnowing where to split a sentence requires that each sub-part usually have at least a noun and verb, and be split at a conjunction.\nTwoIdeas := ""the sky is blue because it scatters sunlight."";\nTwoIdeas:=the sky is blue because it scatters sunlight.\nDefinite Article,Adverb,Noun,Verb (usually participle),Verb (usually participle),Noun,Adjective,Verb (usually participle),Conjunction,Pronoun,Noun,FAIL,Noun\nPart-of-speech information is not available for all words; as you can see, ""scatters"" is not known and returns FAIL. The Reduce command will attempt to use the Lemma command to get the root word.\nVerb (transitive),Noun,Verb (usually participle)\nsky be blue,sky scatter sunlight\nAnother technique for scoring essays is to find the most similar essay or essays in the model set. There are many ways to compute similarity scores.\nAccording to the default similarity metric, BinaryJaccardCoefficient, the second essay is most similar, receiving a score of .22.\nSimilarityScore(NewResponse, Answers, methods = [CosineCoefficient]);\nSimilarityScore(NewResponse, Answers, methods = [DiceCoefficient]);\nThe CosineCoefficient metric instead picks answers one and four; while the DiceCoefficient metric picks essay eight. Each of these metrics, and their binary counterparts, measure similarity in a different way.\nWhen a similarity score exceeds a certain minimum, it indicates that there is a good chance those essays are copies of each other in part or in whole.\nThe DetectPlagiarism command compares all given essays with each other and flags those that exceed a minimum similarity score. In this case we see that essays 1 and 4 are certainly copies of each other, as indicated by a similarity score of 1. Essays 7 and 8 are flagged as possible copies since they are both short, and start with exactly the same 5 words.\nDownload Help Document\nWhat kind of issue would you like to report? (Optional)', 'What is ALEKS?\nALEKS is an online educational software program based on a cycle of assessment and learning. By knowing exactly which concepts the student has mastered and which are new but within reach, ALEKS enables the student to work on those concepts they are most ready to learn. ALEKS is fully online, including explanations, practice and feedback. ALEKS interacts closely with the student, continuously updating its precise map of the student’s knowledge state. ALEKS combines the advantages of one-on-one instruction and evaluation with the convenience of being online.\nWhat is the theory behind ALEKS?\nALEKS is based on a field of Cognitive Science (Mathematical Psychology) called “Knowledge Spaces” (or “Learning Spaces”). The purpose of research in Knowledge Spaces is to model human knowledge in any subject, using mathematical tools such as Set Theory, Combinatorics, and Markovian Processes, so as to make possible fast and accurate assessment through interactive computer applications. There are numerous scientific publications in the field of Knowledge Spaces dating back to the early 1980s.\nWhat is an ALEKS assessment (knowledge check)?\nAn assessment by the ALEKS system consists of a sequence of mathematical problems posed to the student. The answers are in the form of mathematical expressions and constructions produced by the system’s input tools (no multiple choice). The student can answer “I don’t know” where necessary. During an ALEKS assessment, the student is not told whether answers are correct or incorrect. The assessment is adaptive. Each question after the first is chosen on the basis of answers previously submitted. Assessment problems (like practice problems) are algorithmically generated, with random numerical values. The length of the assessment is variable, between 15 and 35 questions. There are no time constraints, but some assessments can take less than a half-hour and a few more than an hour and a half. Students taking an assessment need to have paper and pencil. The ALEKS calculator button will become active when use of a calculator is permitted. No help whatsoever should be given to students taking a knowledge check, not even rephrasing problems. Outside help can easily lead to false assessment results and hinder subsequent work in the ALEKS Learning Mode. Students may be assessed when they first register with ALEKS. It is advisable that all assessments from which the instructor uses data for grading or a similar purpose take place under the instructor’s supervision. At a minimum, the Initial Assessment should be supervised.\nWhat is the Learning Mode?\nThe Learning Mode in ALEKS contains features to help students practice and master specific mathematical concepts and skills. In the Learning Mode, students are always working on a specific concept that they have chosen and that, in the system’s estimation, they are fully prepared to master. If the learner successfully solves an appropriate number of problems based on that concept, the system will tentatively determine that it has been mastered and offer a new choice of topics. If the student has difficulty, the system will attempt to diagnose and interpret the student’s errors. It will also provide explanations of how to solve problems and definitions of mathematical terms. It may suggest the name of a classmate who can help. If the student is unable to master the concept right now, or if the student wishes to change topics, a new choice of topics will be offered. After a certain amount of time has been spent in the Learning Mode, or after a certain amount of progress has been made, the student will automatically be reassessed.\nWhat is the relationship between the Assessment Mode and the Learning Mode in ALEKS?\nThe Assessment and Learning Modes work together in a cyclical fashion, beginning with the Initial Assessment (Knowledge Check). A student is assessed, and the results of the assessment serve as a basis for the student’s entry into the Learning Mode (the student works on concepts that the assessment showed that student most “ready to learn”). After a certain time in the Learning Mode, during which the results of the previous assessment are tentatively updated according to whether the student masters or fails to master new concepts, the student is reassessed and the cycle begins again. In this sense, ALEKS is an interactive learning system guided and powered by ongoing diagnostic assessment.\nCan ALEKS be used by students with intellectual and developmental disabilities? Is ALEKS a remedial tool?\nALEKS is designed to help all students who can read sufficiently to understand what is being displayed on the screen, and who can use a computer. It has been used successfully with students exhibiting a range of learning disabilities. A large part of ALEKS content is compatible with screen-reading technology.\nWhat will it be like taking an ALEKS course?\nThe vast majority of ALEKS problems are “open-ended” (rather than multiple-choice) questions requiring the student to provide authentic input appropriate to the discipline. For example, students may be required to input their final answer as a mathematical expression, chemical equation, histogram, step-by-step math proof, graph of a function, an accounting entry, or a geometrical construction using a virtual pencil, ruler, and compass.\nHow will students receive the codes?\nPACE will send student the ALEKS class codes, then student can go to McGraw/Hill site and enter the code depending on the chosen track.\nAfter I answer a question, can I go back and change my answer?\nOnce you submit an answer, you cannot change it.\nTech Support needed for the support beyond 18 weeks – how is that addressed?\nAnother code may be purchased and applied to the same ALEKS login name.\nWhat is the time commitment?\nALEKS is an adaptive learning system – time spent by one student will be different from the next – we find that for most course areas in ALEKS the average student learns about 3-5 topics/hour and the student typically need to answer 3-5 questions in a row to get completion in one topic area.\nIs Tech Support available?\nStudents are encouraged to approach instructors with technical issues which can be addressed via the Instructor’s manual. Technical support and consultation on the effective use of ALEKS is provided to educators by ALEKS Corporation. Instructors with additional questions are asked to contact the support group via the web: www.support.aleks.com.\nWhat type of computer do I need to use?\nALEKS system requirements are available online through the ALEKS website.\nHow do you ensure quality of instruction?\nLearning Aids are available to provide quality instruction. For those who purchase the e-book you will find the learning aids in the e-book. For those who did not purchase the e-book you can find aid buttons on the website.\nWhat is the refund policy?\nYou can contact ALEKS directly to cancel the course. You must follow their refund policy.\nCan I purchase the e-book later or do I need to purchase it at the start of the course?\nYou can purchase the book before or during the course.']"	['<urn:uuid:7371d252-b56c-41e4-b95e-aa29f87624cd>', '<urn:uuid:4bcd5cc9-b655-4be2-a1c4-bab767832634>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	9	54	2504
31	scientific meaning holographic principle universe projection explain	The holographic principle is a cutting-edge theory in theoretical physics that suggests our universe is a three-dimensional image projected off a two-dimensional surface, similar to how a hologram emerges from a sheet of photographic film. This theory proposes that our three-dimensional world is a representation of activity taking place on a two-dimensional surface full of qubits.	['One of the most cutting-edge theories in theoretical physics, the holographic principle, holds holds that the universe is 3D image projected off a 2D surface, much like a hologram emerges from a sheet of photographic film.\n“In my view, the discovery of holographic entanglement and its generalizations has been one of the most exciting developments in theoretical physics in this century so far,” says Matthew Headrick, associate professor of physics at Brandeis University. “What other new concepts are waiting to be discovered, and what other unexpected connections? We can’t wait to find out.”\nIt’s always bothered physicists that there is one set of rules for the microcosmic, quantum mechanics, and another for the macrocosmic, the theory of relativity.\nIf Headrick and his colleagues can prove the holographic principle, they will have taken a major step toward achieving the holy grail in theoretical physics, a grand unified theory that can explain all the laws and principles governing reality. “We’re not there yet,” Headrick says, “but we’re making progress.”\nSince 2016, Headrick has served as deputy director of the It from Qubit: Quantum Fields, Gravity and Information project, an effort of 18 scientists and their labs to determine whether the holographic principle is correct. The Simons Foundation funds the work.\nHere’s the intro\nWe’ll start small, very small. It’s long been thought that the universe at its most fundamental level is made up of subatomic particles like electrons or quarks. But now physicists believe those particles are made up of something even smaller—information.\nWhen physicists talk about information, they mean the data that describe physical phenomena. The mass of an object, the direction of the spin of an electron, and e=mc^2 are all units of information.\nIf you gathered all the information that’s out there, you would have the complete instruction booklet for building everything in our universe.\nQubits are bizarre\nThe tiniest levels of the universe are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. Here things start to get very weird and counterintuitive.\nUnits of information in the realm of quantum mechanics are called qubits.\nHeadrick studies the quantum entanglement of qubits, a very strange phenomenon unique to the realm of quantum mechanics.\nSuppose you have two qubits whose values can be either 1 or 0. When the qubits are entangled, their values become correlated. When you measure the first qubit, its value might turn out to be 0. Check the other qubit, its value might be 0, too. But what if the first qubit has a value of 1? The second qubit’s value could also change to 1.\nIt’s as if the qubits communicate with each other, with the first telling the second, “Hey, this physicist over here just found out I’m a 1. You better be a 1, too.” Amazingly and bizarrely, this communication can happen over vast distances with messages seemingly relayed faster than the speed of light.\nAlso, qubits are flat\nIn most cases, when you drop an object into a jar—we’ll use a jelly bean—it will fall inside and take up space. Put in another jelly bean, the amount of unfilled space shrinks and the volume of the jelly beans increases.\nIt doesn’t work this way with qubits. Qubits won’t fall into the jar but instead spread out on a surface. Add a qubit, it will adhere to the side of the jar. Add another qubit, it will do the same. Increasing the number of qubits doesn’t increase the volume. Instead, it increases the surface area the qubits take up.\nMore and more qubits spreading out across a flat surface—this is how you get the two-dimensional plane described by the holographic principle.\nSo how do you get three dimensions?\nOnce you move beyond the realm of the teeny-tiny, the laws of quantum mechanics no longer work. Strange as it sounds, on the macrocosmic level, you need a different set of laws of physics to explain what’s going on.\nEnter Einstein’s theory of relativity. To calculate cosmic events like the path followed by light or the orbit of Mercury around the sun, you need the theory of relativity.\nThe building blocks of relativity are also units of information. Now though, they’re called bits.\nAnd bits behave in a way that’s much more familiar to us. They exist in three dimensions.\nAnd how do you get a hologram?\nLet’s go back to that two-dimensional surface covered with entangled qubits. Since the value of a qubit changes depending on the value of its entangled pair, there’s a degree of indeterminacy built into the system. If you haven’t yet measured the first qubit, you can’t be sure about the second. The amount of uncertainty in any given system is called its entropy.\nAs qubits become entangled and disentangled, the level of entropy rises and falls. You wind up with fields of entropy in a constantly changing state.\nThe holographic principle holds that our three-dimensional world is a representation or projection of all this activity taking place on a two-dimensional surface full of qubits.\nHere’s the big question\nIt’s always bothered physicists that there is one set of rules for the microcosmic, quantum mechanics, and another for the macrocosmic, the theory of relativity. It doesn’t make sense that there should be two different and incompatible groups of mathematical formulas at work in our universe. Physicists assume there must be some way to bring them into harmony.\nSo therein lies the central question for Headrick and his colleagues: Starting in the two-dimensional realm of qubits and quantum mechanics and then scaling up in size, how precisely do we wind up with bits and relativity? It’s a matter of constructing a single mathematical model that explains the transformation.\nFigure it out and you’ll have solved one of the biggest mysteries in theoretical physics. From the tiniest to the largest phenomenon, we’ll have a unified theory of reality.\nRight now the holographic principle remains an unproven theory. Where it will lead next is an open question. Odds are though, it’ll be stranger than anything yet imagined in science fiction.\nSource: Brandeis University']	['<urn:uuid:b0e33000-d926-4d24-bda7-2e7ea4c5cb78>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	7	56	1008
32	types respiratory protection silica dust	For silica dust protection, there are several NIOSH-approved types of respiratory protection: N95 respirators that filter 95% of airborne particles, Powered Air-Purifying Respirators (PAPRs) with battery-powered fans for high dust concentrations, and Supplied Air Respirators (SARs) that provide clean air from a remote source. For abrasive blasting specifically, only four types are suitable: continuous-flow respirators with loose-fitting hoods (APF 25), continuous-flow respirators with tight-fitting hoods (APF 50), positive pressure respirators with tight-fitting half-mask face pieces (APF 1000), and pressure-demand respirators with tight-fitting face pieces (APF 2000).	"['Avoid Silicosis from Abrasive Sand Blasting\nQuick Tips #384\nAbrasive sand blasting is a common practice for workers who fabricate products made of metal. Sand blasting is used to remove rust or to clean metal surfaces of oils. Industries that rely on this sand blasting on a daily basis include painters who work on large structures like bridges, granite monument makers, foundries and shipbuilders.\nOne downside to the use of sand blasting is the media used; silica. The term ""silica"" broadly refers to the mineral compound silicon dioxide (SiO2). Although silica can be crystalline or amorphous in form, crystalline silica is more hazardous to employees. It is most commonly found in the form of quartz, but it is also found in substances such as cristobalite, tridymite and tripoli. Breathing crystalline silica dust poses an industrial hazard and can lead to severe health problems and even death.\nExposure to silica or crystalline silica can cause silicosis and a host of other illnesses. Silicosis is one of the world\'s oldest known occupational diseases, with reports of employees contracting the disease dating back to ancient Greece. OSHA regulates silica under the General Industry, Construction and Shipyard standards. Air sampling, ventilation, personal protective equipment, respirator usage, silica substitutes, blasting cabinets and room design are hazards addressed by OSHA within these standards.\nOSHA has a list of preferred solutions to help protect workers from exposure to silica during abrasive blasting. The most preferred method is to use a silica substitute. Next on OSHA’s list is implementing engineering controls such as ventilation, followed by improving work practices. OSHA’s final line of defense is the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators. For more on silica exposure and silicosis see our Quick Tips #354.\nWhen using silica in the workplace, the first action that needs to be completed is to see what, if any, protective measures need to be taken. To make this determination, collecting and measuring the concentration of silica in the air will need to be done. Once collected, the sample is sent to a laboratory for analysis. The results of this analysis will determine if better ventilation and/or a change in work practices or respiratory protection is needed. If it is required, OSHA advises that respiratory protection would be the last line of defense for choices of protection.\nTypically, air monitoring is done by an Industrial Hygienist. If there is not an Industrial Hygienist or safety professional available on your worksite, you may find on your own or consult the insurance carrier for your facility for a recommendation. Collecting an air sample is done using a sampling pump and filter cassettes. The pump will pull air from around the workers breathing zone and it will collect in the filter cassette. The person doing the sandblasting work and possibly the nearest workers, who may be exposed, would wear the pump and the cassette. After an eight hour work shift the cassettes will be collected and sent to a laboratory for analysis.\nWhen analyzing the silica content of the cassettes collected from your workplace, the lab will need to know the contents of the sample collected. For instance, the percentage of quartz, cristobalite, tridymite and respirable dust specific to your worksite needs to be taken into account to calculate the permissible exposure limit (PEL). The different percentages can change what the PEL is for your workplace. The make-up of the silica being used can be found in the SDS or product label.\nOSHA has a helpful calculator on its website called Advisor Genius which will let you input your numbers and information and come up with three different result types; PEL (calculated permissible limit for dust to which the worker may be exposed), Exposure (the actual amount of dust in your work environment) and Severity (this number tells you if you are above or below the limit). The permissible exposure limits for crystalline silica for General Industry, Construction and Maritime are all the same and can be found in OSHA regulation 1910.1000 Table Z-3. The limits listed for all the types of silica are 3mg/m3.\nAbrasive sand blasting is where the most severe cases of silicosis can occur. Many of these cases occur because the sand blasting is performed at outside locations where engineering controls, such as ventilation or dust collection, are not possible. The workers in these situations (and abrasive sandblasting in general) may benefit from using silica substitutes. Some of the possible substitutes are:\n|Aluminum Oxide||Glass Beads||Steel Grit|\n|Aluminum Shot||Melamine Plastic||Steel Shot|\n|Ambient Polycarbonate||Novaculite||Urea Plastic|\n|Apricot Pits||Polycarbonate||Walnut Shells|\n|Corn Cobs||Silicon Carbide||Wheat Grain|\n|Cryogenic Polycarbonate||Stainless Cast Shot||White Aluminum Oxide|\n|Emery||Stainless Cut Wire||Zircon|\nThe advantages of using a silica substitute outweigh using silica in abrasive sandblasting. Any health issues and healthcare costs related to silica would greatly reduced or eliminated. The time and cost of implementing and maintaining engineering controls would also be eliminated. The disadvantages are that the substitutes may not be as hard as a silica product; therefore, more of the substitute may need to be used to achieve the same result. It may also be more expensive. However, with more than two dozen substitute types available, there should be one product that will get your needed job done.\nEngineering Controls & Ventilation\nOSHA regulation 1910.94(a)(1)(viii) requires mechanical ventilation for the removal of contaminated air where abrasive sand blasting and silica use takes place. In protecting employees from contaminated air, engineering controls such as ventilation should be the first choice, after sourcing silica substitutes. This can be accomplished through a number of options. OSHA describes a ventilation system in 1910.94(a)(1)(viii) Exhaust Ventilation System. A system for removing contaminated air from a space, comprising two or more of the following elements (a) enclosure or hood, (b) duct work, (c) dust collecting equipment, (d) exhauster and (e) discharge stack.\nThere are a variety of ways that sandblasting can be accomplished. The most common types of sandblasting performed are in blasting rooms, cabinets or in open air. A blasting room is an enclosed room where the operator works inside the area, moving around freely with respiratory protection or supplied air with equipment such as an accepted blasting helmet. Sandblasting in a blasting room ( Fig. 1 below), is generally performed where larger pieces need to be sand blasted. Cabinet sandblasting (Fig. 2 below), another common application, is generally performed in an enclosed cabinet where the operator stands outside the cabinet and operates a sand blast nozzle through openings in the cabinet wall. Gloves usually extend into the cabinet and the silica dust is evacuated to a dust collection and ventilation system. Where a room or cabinet enclosure is not feasible, due to size or logistics, abrasive sandblasting is done in an outdoor location. The ventilation needed is dependent on each situation. OSHA standard 1910.94 (a)(4)(i) gives the requirements on the construction, installation and inspection requirements for abrasive blasting ventilation as set forth by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) which is specified by OSHA.\nRespiratory Protection & PPE Respirators\nThere are only 4 types of respiratory protection that are suitable and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) approved for abrasive blasting. These types are:\n- Continuous-flow respirator with a loose fitting hood and an APF* of 25\n- Continuous-flow respirator with a tight-fitting hood and an APF of 50\n- Positive pressure respirator with a tight- fitting half-mask face piece and an APF of 1000\n- Pressure-demand or positive-pressure respirator containing a tight-fitting face piece and an APF of 2000\n* APF = assigned protection factor from NIOSH\nAir purifying respirators and powered air purifying respirators (PAPR’s) are not recommended for abrasive blasting operations but they may be suitable for auxiliary work, such as clean-up operations.\nIn very limited situations, the 29 CFR 1910.94(a)(5)(ii)(b) interpretation only provides for limited deviation, such as a breakdown in the air supply or when the abrasive blasting respirator is temporarily unavailable. Only then can a dust filter respirator can be used as interim protection. If it does not provide additional face and eye protection supplementary equipment will be needed. This is in accordance with the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.94 (a)(5)(v)(b).\nWhether it be General Industry 29 CFR 1910, Construction 29 CFR 1926 or Shipyard 29 CFR 1915 standards, all these OSHA standards have PPE requirements that need to be followed. The requirements may also intertwine with each other such as the shipyard PPE standard 1915 referring to the 1910 standard for respiratory protection. All three industry standards are similar in their PPE requirements also. The following is an example of the requirements from the shipbuilding 1915 standard for PPE.\nWorkers performing abrasive blasting should wear:\n- A protective helmet (if the respirator design does not provide this protection and there is potential for head injury); (1915.155)\n- Heavy canvas or leather gloves and aprons (or equivalent protection) to protect from the impact of abrasives; (1915.34(c)(3)(iv))\n- Safety shoes or boots; (1915.156)\n- Hearing protectors to reduce noise levels below the OSHA PEL’s; (1910.95)\nAn example of typical PPE worn by a worker when performing abrasive blasting is shown in Fig.3.\nAbrasive blasting can create a host of safety factors, considerations and necessary protections when it comes to employees in any industry in which it is performed. To help keep employees who are performing abrasive blasting and those in the areas around them safe, NIOSH has a list of recommendations. They recommend:\n- Using a silica substitute and that silica only be used as a last resort.\n- Exhaust systems and other dust controls be used as the primary means of protection.\n- Supplemental NIOSH approved respirators be used when engineering controls cannot prevent exposures below the recommended limits.\n- Environmental monitoring be conducted in all sandblasting operations to help insure employees are not overexposed and receive the proper PPE.\n- If silica sand is used, only the highest level NIOSH approved respiratory protection, such as positive pressure or pressure- demand hood or full facepiece should be used.\n- Respirators should be properly fitted according to the manufacturer’s instructions, NIOSH guidelines and the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.134.\nFollowing OSHA regulations and NIOSH recommendations will help keep those performing abrasive blasting (and those that are in and around the operation) safe and healthy.\nSources for Information:\nFind even more information you can use to help make informed decisions about the regulatory issues you face in your workplace every day.

Grainger, Inc.', 'Across numerous industries, silica dust protection is a critical component of workplace safety.\nTypically, this dangerous, even deadly dust is generated during activities such as cutting, grinding, drilling, and crushing materials that contain crystalline silica, such as concrete, stone, and sand.\nSince it’s 100 times smaller than a grain of sand, workers can breathe it in without realizing the dangers.\nBreathing in silica dust can have severe health consequences, including respiratory diseases and lung cancer. And, approx. 2.3 million people in the U.S. are exposed to silica at work every year.\nSo, what are some of the dangers? More importantly, what do you need to know about silica dust protection for you and your team?\nLet’s break it down.\nRelated Article: OSHA Targets Silica Hazards in Cut Stone Industry\nRelated Article: How to Protect Your Team from the Effects of Silica\nHealth Implications of Silica Dust Exposure\nWhen inhaled, silica dust particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and cause various respiratory ailments.\nProlonged exposure to high levels of silica dust can lead to the development of silicosis, a debilitating and irreversible lung disease. Silicosis is characterized by the formation of scar tissue in the lungs, reducing their ability to function effectively.\nSymptoms of silicosis include persistent cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue.\nIn addition to silicosis, silica dust exposure is also associated with an increased risk of developing other respiratory conditions. These include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tuberculosis, lung cancer, and kidney disease. Furthermore, silica dust has been linked to an increased susceptibility to respiratory infections and exacerbation of existing respiratory conditions, such as asthma.\nRelated Article: NIOSH Takes Step toward Reducing Silica Dust Exposure in Mines\nThe Importance of a Workplace Respiratory Protection Program\nGiven the serious health risks posed by silica dust, it is crucial for workers to use appropriate respiratory protection measures to minimize their exposure. Respiratory protection can effectively reduce the inhalation of silica dust particles and safeguard the respiratory system. There are various types of respiratory protection equipment available, and the choice of the most suitable option depends on the nature of the work being performed.\nFor proper silica dust protection, your team should be equipped with one of the following.\n1. N95 Respirators\nN95 respirators are a common form of respiratory protection widely used in industries where workers are exposed to silica dust. These respirators filter out at least 95% of airborne particles, including silica dust, with a diameter of 0.3 micrometers or larger.\nN95 respirators create a seal around the nose and mouth, ensuring that the air breathed in is properly filtered. Remember that for silica dust protection, it’s essential to conduct fit testing to ensure a proper fit.\n2. Powered Air-Purifying Respirators (PAPRs)\nPAPRs are another option for respiratory protection, particularly in situations where the concentration of silica dust is high.\nPAPRs use a battery-powered fan to draw air through filters before delivering it to the wearer’s breathing zone. These respirators provide a higher level of protection than N95 respirators, and are more comfortable to wear for extended periods.\nHowever, they require regular maintenance, including filter replacement and battery recharging.\n3. Supplied Air Respirators (SARs)\nSARs, also known as airline respirators, provide a continuous supply of clean air from a remote source.\nThey are suitable for environments with extremely high levels of silica dust or where the oxygen concentration is insufficient. SARs are typically used in confined spaces, such as underground mines or tunnels. These respirators offer excellent silica dust protection, they can sometimes restrict mobility due to the need for an air supply line.\nImplementing an Effective Silica Dust Protection Program at Your Worksite\nTo ensure effective respiratory protection against silica dust, employers should establish comprehensive respiratory protection programs.\nThese programs should include the following elements:\n1. Hazard Assessment\nEmployers must conduct a thorough assessment of workplace hazards to determine the extent of silica dust exposure. This assessment helps identify areas requiring respiratory protection and enables the selection of appropriate equipment.\n2. Silica Dust Protection Training and Education\nWorkers should receive proper training on the risks associated with silica dust exposure, the proper use and maintenance of respiratory protection equipment, and the importance of following safe work practices. Regular refresher training sessions should be conducted to reinforce these principles.\n3. Proper Equipment Selection\nEmployers should select respiratory protection equipment that meets the required standards and is appropriate for the specific work environment. This includes ensuring that respirators have the correct filter type and efficiency level for silica dust particles.\n4. Fit Testing and Maintenance\nFit testing should be conducted to ensure that respirators fit properly and provide an effective seal. Regular maintenance, including inspection, cleaning, and replacement of filters, is essential to keep respiratory protection equipment in good working condition.\n5. Monitoring and Evaluation\nRegular monitoring of silica dust levels in the workplace is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of control measures and identify any necessary adjustments or improvements to the respiratory protection program.\nSee OSHA’s guidelines on respirable crystalline silica- 1926.1153.\nBringing It Together\nProtecting workers from the adverse effects of silica dust is essential for maintaining occupational health and safety. By understanding the health hazards associated with silica dust exposure and implementing appropriate respiratory protection measures, employers can safeguard the well-being of their workforce.\nRespiratory protection programs, including proper equipment selection, fit testing, training, and maintenance, play a crucial role in mitigating the risks posed by silica dust, enabling workers to breathe safely and maintain their long-term respiratory health.\nAbout Worksite Medical\nIn most cases, OSHA requires medical surveillance testing, and at no cost to employees.\nWorksite Medical makes that program easier with mobile medical testing.\nWe conduct on-site respirator fit tests, as well as audiometric exams, pulmonary function tests and heavy metal lab work, right on your job site. We also keep accurate, easy-to-access medical records for your convenience.

Walter Arnold does not use jigsaw puzzles, but rather specializes in photographing abandoned spaces and creating beauty from decay.	"[""Got A Minute? with Walter Arnold\nPublished: Tuesday, November 26, 2013 at 4:30 a.m.\nLast Modified: Monday, November 25, 2013 at 11:18 p.m.\nGot a Minute: Walter Arnold\nOccupation: Professional photographer\nIn 2009, you stumbled on an abandoned airplane graveyard in St. Augustine, Fla. and started shooting photos as an amateur photographer. Talk about that experience.\nI was out with my best friend, Casey, looking for unique locations to do some portraits for him. Since he grew up in St. Augustine, he had known of the airplane graveyard right off the side of U.S. Highway 1. We stopped there and ended up shooting there for over four hours.\nI climbed inside each and every plane and went home with a large amount of images to edit. I returned several times over the following year. I instantly fell in love with the old planes and enjoyed this new challenge of trying to create beauty in a place where others might have only seen junk. After photographing the planes, I became fascinated with the concept and thus was born my current series, “The Art of Abandonment.”\nYou were a banker at the time, right?\nYes. While my passion for photography grew, I was working a full-time job at SunTrust Bank in Hendersonville as a branch manager. From 2009 to 2012, I was steadily growing my photography business and began showcasing my work in local galleries and exhibiting at regional arts festivals.\nIn July of 2012 I was at a crossroads with my banking and photography careers and had the opportunity to part ways with the bank and pursue my dream of being a full-time professional photographer.\nHow was the transition to professional photographer?\nConsidering leaving the security and familiarity of banking and stepping out into photography full-time was a terrifying and exciting decision to make. In retrospect the decision was easy. If I had not attempted to follow my dream I would have regretted it the rest of my life and constantly wondered “What if?”\nSo in July of 2012 I left SunTrust and began my new life as a photographer. I told myself I would give it one year to see if I could be successful making a living and providing for my family. It's been over a year and a half now and I have no plans to stop or slow down.\nTell me about how your project with Ron Howard and Imagin8tion came about.\nIn 2011, Canon began a contest called Project Imagin8ion. The idea was to use photographs to help inspire a Hollywood film produced by Ron Howard. Over 96,000 people submitted images in eight categories such as time, setting, character, obstacle, goal, mood, relationship, and the unknown.\nAfter a national vote narrowed the images to 10 in each category, Ron Howard selected one from each category. My image of one of the cockpits from the airplane graveyard in St. Augustine was selected to inspire the setting for the film.\nWhat happened after Howard picked your photo for that honor?\nAfter the images were selected, Ron and his daughter, Bryce, sat down with screenwriter Dane Charbeneau and wrote out the screenplay for a film called “When You Find Me.” The challenge for them was to truly integrate the images into the story and tie them together in a deep and meaningful way. They truly succeeded in every way. Not only did the images inspire key elements of the film and storytelling process, but the depth of the story and bonds formed with the characters were stunning.\nWhat was it like to be in Hollywood for the premier of the movie that was based on your photograph?\nIn November of 2011, Canon flew me and my wife up to New York City to attend a red carpet premiere and watch the final film with Ron Howard and his daughter. The event was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Getting to meet Ron, Bryce and so many other celebrities and walk the red carpet with them was incredible! The final film was a 25-minute short film and can be viewed in its entirety online at http://bit.ly/10cjzC8.\nTell me about Imagina10n. Two of your photos were chosen for that project?\nProject Imaginat10n was the second iteration of Canon's contest and began in 2012. The idea was that instead of one film being inspired by photographs, that 10 films would be created. Five would be directed by celebrities Eva Longoria; Jamie Foxx; Biz Stone, the founder of Twitter; James Murphy, of rock band LCD Soundsystem; and Georgina Chapman, a fashion designer.\nThe other five films would be produced by independent filmmakers. Canon encouraged everyone, even past winners, to submit images to the new contest. By some stroke of luck, one of my images of an abandoned telephone switchboard was selected by the blind jury and made the finals of the contest.\nLongoria and Murphy both selected my image and used it as inspiration for their own films, which can be viewed online at www.longliveimagination.com.\nYou've won a lot of awards for your photography. Does any particular award stand out to you?\nI have been very honored and blessed to receive numerous awards while touring my work across the country. My images have been featured in art galleries, museums, television shows and magazines. I have won five best-in-show awards over the last year at art festivals across the Southeast. It's always an honor to receive such a distinction and equally unexpected for me as well.\nWhat do you enjoy about photographing abandoned spaces and items?\nCreating the “Art of Abandonment” series has been an extremely rewarding experience for me. Basically I travel the country seeking out old, historic, forgotten locations and try to create beauty in these unexpected places. I look at this series as a sort of historic preservation through art.\nI go beyond just taking a photograph, and attempt to bring these places back to life in my images. Working with the owners and preservation groups, I am able to uncover the history and stories of these places and share them with the world so that people can remember the history and the significance of these modern ruins.\nWhat types of feelings are you experiencing when you're photographing abandoned spaces and items?\nWhen I visit and explore these old locations, I can't help but imagine what they once were in their prime. Many of these places hold untold stories and significance, and I can't help but weave together these stories in my mind as I explore. People often ask if I get creeped out while inside some of these places and the answer is usually no. Even in a decaying state, I still get a sense of life in these places and I try to communicate that through my images.\nI don't create creepy scary scenes; I strive to show the warmth and life that still shines ever so faintly through the dust and decay.\nIt seems amazing that stumbling on an abandoned airplane graveyard in Florida years ago has led to an entirely new career for you. Does that give you pause sometimes?\nThe airplane graveyard holds a very special place in my heart, as it was a strong inspiration for my artistic career. After years of looking at the images of the planes I began to picture them as old war heroes sitting around, sharing their stories and battle scars. Being personified as such, it was heart-wrenching for me to discover that in May of 2011, all of the planes there were demolished and sold for scrap.\nHowever, the act of destroying the planes just serves as a constant reminder that these historic places are constantly in danger of disappearing forever. That is why I feel it is important for me to be out there documenting and telling the stories of these places before they are gone. They are a part of our history and they were meaningful and important at one time, and their stories deserve to be told and remembered.\nIn addition to my website where I sell my photography, www.TheDigitalMirage.com, I run a blog, www.ArtofAbandonment.com, where people can read the stories and history of these abandoned locations. I tell not only our experiences there, but also provide historic background and images of these locations when they were in their prime. I am constantly updating both sites with new images and stories.

34	How do weather and climate scientists study Earth's atmosphere?	Scientists study Earth's atmosphere through multiple approaches. Meteorologists focus on weather patterns, clouds, hurricanes, and tornadoes, using modern technology like radars and satellites to forecast weather. Climatologists study long-term atmospheric changes that define average climates, examining factors like carbon dioxide levels and their effects on global warming. Atmospheric physicists use fluid flow equations, chemical models, and radiation balancing to understand the atmosphere, while atmospheric chemists study the atmosphere's composition and its interactions with living organisms.	"[""High School Earth Science/Earth Science and Its Branches\n- Define and describe Earth Science as a general field with many branches.\n- Identify the field of geology as a branch of Earth Science that deals with the solid part of the Earth.\n- Describe the field of oceanography as a branch of Earth Science that has several subdivisions that deal with the various aspects of the ocean.\n- Define the field of meteorology as a branch of Earth Science that deals with the atmosphere.\n- Understand that astronomy is an extension of Earth Science that examines other parts of the solar system and universe.\n- List some of the other branches of Earth Science, and how they relate to the study of the Earth.\nOverview of Earth Science\nEarth is the mighty planet upon which we all live. Only recently have humans begun to understand the complexity of this planet. In fact, it was only a few hundred years ago that we discovered that Earth was just a tiny part of an enormous galaxy, which in turn is a small part of an even greater universe. Earth Science deals with any and all aspects of the Earth. Our Earth has molten lava, icy mountain peaks, steep canyons and towering waterfalls. Earth scientists study the atmosphere high above us as well as the planet's core far beneath us. Earth scientists study parts of the Earth as big as continents and as small as the tiniest atom. In all its wonder, Earth scientists seek to understand the beautiful sphere on which we thrive (Figure 1.9).\nBecause the Earth is so large and science is so complex, Earth scientists specialize in studying just a small aspect of our Earth. Since all of the branches are connected together, specialists work together to answer complicated questions. Let's look at some important branches of Earth Science.\nGeology is the study of the solid matter that makes up Earth. Anything that is solid, like rocks, minerals, mountains, and canyons is part of geology. Geologists study the way that these objects formed, their composition, how they interact with one another, how they erode, and how humans can use them. Geology has so many branches that most geologists become specialists in one area. For example, a mineralogist studies the composition and structure of minerals such as halite (rock salt), quartz, calcite, and magnetite (Figure 1.10).\nA volcanologist braves the high temperatures and molten lava of volcanoes. Seismologists study earthquakes and the forces of the Earth that create them. Seismologists monitor earthquakes worldwide to help protect people and property from harm (Figure 1.11). Scientists interested in fossils are paleontologists, while scientists who compare other planets' geologies to that of the Earth are called planetary geologists. There are geologists who only study the Moon. Some geologists look for petroleum, others are specialists on soil. Geochronologists study how old rocks are and determine how different rock layers formed. There are so many specialties in geology that there is probably an expert in almost anything you can think of related to the Earth (Figure 1.12).\nOceanography is the study of everything in the ocean environment. More than 70% of the Earth's surface is covered with water. Most of that water is found in the oceans. Recent technology has allowed us to go to the deepest parts of the ocean, yet much of the ocean remains truly unexplored. Some people call the ocean the last frontier. But it is a frontier already deeply influence by human activity. As the human population gets even bigger, we are affecting the ocean in many ways. Populations of fish and other marine species have plummeted because of overfishing; contaminants are polluting the waters, and global warming caused by greenhouse gases is melting the thick ice caps. As ocean waters warm, the water expands and, along with the melting ice caps, causes sea levels to rise.\nClimatologists help us understand the climate and how it will change in the future in response to global warming. Oceanographers study the vast seas and help us to understand all that happens in the water world. As with geology, there are many branches of oceanography. Physical oceanography is the study of the processes in the ocean itself, like waves and ocean currents (Figure 1.13). Marine geology uses geology to study ocean earthquakes, mountains, and trenches. Chemical oceanography studies the natural elements in ocean water and pollutants.\nClimatology and Meteorology\nMeteorologists don’t study meteors — they study the atmosphere! Perhaps this branch of Earth Science is strangely named but it is very important to living creatures like humans. Meteorology includes the study of weather patterns, clouds, hurricanes, and tornadoes. Using modern technology like radars and satellites, meteorologists work to predict or forecast the weather. Because of more accurate forecasting techniques, meteorologists can help us to prepare for major storms, as well as help us know when we should go on picnics.\nClimatologists and other atmospheric scientists study the whole atmosphere, which is a thin layer of gas that surrounds the Earth. Most of it is within about 10 - 11 kilometers of the Earth’s surface. Earth’s atmosphere is denser than Mars’s thin atmosphere, where the average temperature is -63° C, and not as thick as the dense atmosphere on Venus, where carbon dioxide in the atmosphere makes it hot and sulfuric acid rains in the upper atmosphere. The atmosphere on Earth is just dense enough to even out differences in temperature from the equator to the poles, and contains enough oxygen for animals to breathe.\nOver the last several decades, climatologists studying the gases in our atmosphere have found that humans are putting a dangerous amount of carbon dioxide into the air by burning fossil fuels (Figure 1.14). Normally, the atmosphere contains only small amounts of carbon dioxide, and too much of it makes it trap heat from the sun, causing the Earth to heat up, an effect we call global warming. Climatologists can help us better understand the climate and how it may change in the future in response to different amounts of greenhouse gases and other factors (Figure 1.15).\nAstronomers have proven that our Earth and solar system are not the only set of planets in the universe. By 2007, over a hundred planets outside our solar system had been discovered. Although no one can be sure how many there are, astronomers estimate that there are billions of other planets. In addition, the universe contains black holes, other galaxies, asteroids, comets, and nebula. As big as Earth seems to us, the entire universe is vastly greater. Our Earth is an infinitesimally small part of our universe.\nAstronomers use resources on the Earth to study physical things beyond the Earth. They use a variety of instruments like optical telescopes and radio telescopes to see things far beyond what the human eye can see. Spacecraft travel great distances in space to send us information on faraway places, while telescopes in orbit observe astronomical bodies from the darkness of space (Figure 1.16).\nAstronomers ask a wide variety of questions. Astronomers could study how an object or energy outside of Earth could affect us. An impact from an asteroid could have terrible effects for life on Earth. Strong bursts of energy from the sun, called solar flares, can knock out a power grid or disturb radio, television or cell phone communications. But astronomers ask bigger questions too. How was the universe created? Are there other planets on which we might live? Are there resources that we could use? Is there other life out there? Astronomy also relies on Earth Science, when scientists compare what we know about life on Earth to the chances of finding life beyond this planet.\nOther Branches of Earth Science\nGeology, oceanography, and meteorology represent a large part of Earth science, while astronomy represents science beyond Earth. However, there are still many smaller branches of science that deal with the Earth or interact greatly with Earth sciences. Most branches of science are connected with other branches of science in some way or another. A biologist who studies monkeys in rainforests must be concerned with the water cycle that brings the rain to the rainforests. She must understand the organic chemistry of the food the monkeys eat, as well as the behavior between the monkeys. She might examine the soil in which the trees of the rainforest grow. She must even understand the economy of the rainforest to understand reasons for its destruction. This is just one example of how all branches of science are connected.\nBelow are examples of a few branches of science that are directly related to Earth science. Environmental scientists study the ways that humans interact with the Earth and the effects of that interaction. We hope to find better ways of sustaining the environment. Biogeography is a branch of science that investigates changes in populations of organisms in relation to place over time. These scientists attempt to explain the causes of species' movement in history. Ecologists focus on ecosystems, the complex relationship of all life forms and the environment in a given place (Figure 1.17). They try to predict the chain reactions that could occur when one part of the ecosystem is disrupted.\nAs opposed to an oceanographer, a limnologist studies inland waters like rivers and lakes. A hydrogeologist focuses on underground water found between soil and rock particles, while glaciologists study glaciers and ice.\nNone of these scientific endeavors would be possible without geographers who explore the features of the surface and work with cartographers, who make maps. Stratigraphy is another area of Earth science which examines layers of rock beneath the surface (Figure 1.18). This helps us to understand the geological history of the Earth. There is a branch of science for every interest and each is related to the others.\n- What are three major branches of Earth science?\n- What branch of science deals with stars and galaxies beyond the Earth?\n- List important functions of Earth scientists.\n- What do you think is the focus of a meteorologist?\n- An ecologist notices that an important coral reef is dying off.

Meteorology includes atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric physics with a major focus on weather forecasting. Climatology is the study of atmospheric changes (both long and short-term) that define average climates and their change over time, due to both natural and anthropogenic climate variability. Aeronomy is the study of the upper layers of the atmosphere, where dissociation and ionization are important. Atmospheric science has been extended to the field of planetary science and the study of the atmospheres of the planets of the solar system.\nThe term aerology (from Greek ἀήρ, aēr, ""air""; and -λογία, -logia) is sometimes used as an alternative term for the study of Earth\'s atmosphere. Early pioneers in the field include Léon Teisserenc de Bort and Richard Assmann.\nAtmospheric chemistry is a branch of atmospheric science in which the chemistry of the Earth\'s atmosphere and that of other planets is studied. It is a multidisciplinary field of research and draws on environmental chemistry, physics, meteorology, computer modeling, oceanography, geology and volcanology and other disciplines. Research is increasingly connected with other areas of study such as climatology.\nThe composition and chemistry of the atmosphere is of importance for several reasons, but primarily because of the interactions between the atmosphere and living organisms. The composition of the Earth\'s atmosphere has been changed by human activity and some of these changes are harmful to human health, crops and ecosystems. Examples of problems which have been addressed by atmospheric chemistry include acid rain, photochemical smog and global warming. Atmospheric chemistry seeks to understand the causes of these problems, and by obtaining a theoretical understanding of them, allow possible solutions to be tested and the effects of changes in government policy evaluated.\nAtmospheric dynamics involves the study of observations and theory dealing with all motion systems of meteorological importance. Common topics studied include diverse phenomena such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, gravity waves, tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones, jet streams, and global-scale circulations. The goal of dynamical studies is to explain the observed circulations on the basis of fundamental principles from physics. The objectives of such studies incorporate improving weather forecasting, developing methods for predicting seasonal and interannual climate fluctuations, and understanding the implications of human-induced perturbations (e.g., increased carbon dioxide concentrations or depletion of the ozone layer) on the global climate.\nAtmospheric physics is the application of physics to the study of the atmosphere. Atmospheric physicists attempt to model Earth\'s atmosphere and the atmospheres of the other planets using fluid flow equations, chemical models, radiation balancing, and energy transfer processes in the atmosphere and underlying oceans. In order to model weather systems, atmospheric physicists employ elements of scattering theory, wave propagation models, cloud physics, statistical mechanics and spatial statistics, each of which incorporate high levels of mathematics and physics. Atmospheric physics has close links to meteorology and climatology and also covers the design and construction of instruments for studying the atmosphere and the interpretation of the data they provide, including remote sensing instruments.\nIn the United Kingdom, atmospheric studies are underpinned by the Meteorological Office. Divisions of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) oversee research projects and weather modeling involving atmospheric physics. The U.S. National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center also carries out studies of the high atmosphere.\nIn contrast to meteorology, which studies short term weather systems lasting up to a few weeks, climatology studies the frequency and trends of those systems. It studies the periodicity of weather events over years to millennia, as well as changes in long-term average weather patterns, in relation to atmospheric conditions. Climatologists, those who practice climatology, study both the nature of climates – local, regional or global – and the natural or human-induced factors that cause climates to change. Climatology considers the past and can help predict future climate change.\nPhenomena of climatological interest include the atmospheric boundary layer, circulation patterns, heat transfer (radiative, convective and latent), interactions between the atmosphere and the oceans and land surface (particularly vegetation, land use and topography), and the chemical and physical composition of the atmosphere. Related disciplines include astrophysics, atmospheric physics, chemistry, ecology, physical geography, geology, geophysics, glaciology, hydrology, oceanography, and volcanology.\nAtmospheres on other celestial bodies\nAll of the Solar System\'s planets have atmospheres. This is because their gravity is strong enough to keep gaseous particles close to the surface. Larger gas giants are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases hydrogen and helium close by, while the smaller planets lose these gases into space. The composition of the Earth\'s atmosphere is different from the other planets because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet have introduced free molecular oxygen. Much of Mercury\'s atmosphere has been blasted away by the solar wind. The only moon that has retained a dense atmosphere is Titan. There is a thin atmosphere on Triton, and a trace of an atmosphere on the Moon.\nPlanetary atmospheres are affected by the varying degrees of energy received from either the Sun or their interiors, leading to the formation of dynamic weather systems such as hurricanes, (on Earth), planet-wide dust storms (on Mars), an Earth-sized anticyclone on Jupiter (called the Great Red Spot), and holes in the atmosphere (on Neptune). At least one extrasolar planet, HD 189733 b, has been claimed to possess such a weather system, similar to the Great Red Spot but twice as large.\nHot Jupiters have been shown to be losing their atmospheres into space due to stellar radiation, much like the tails of comets. These planets may have vast differences in temperature between their day and night sides which produce supersonic winds, although the day and night sides of HD 189733b appear to have very similar temperatures, indicating that planet\'s atmosphere effectively redistributes the star\'s energy around the planet.\n- Ultraviolet radiation in the solar system By Manuel Vázquez, Arnold Hanslmeier\n- University of Washington.

35	How do Sudanese artists document cultural memory and social change?	Sudanese artists like Salute Yal Bannot document cultural experiences through music about women's rights and racial identity, while research institutions like Andariya collect and analyze artistic activism data. This documentation trend is part of a broader regional movement, as evidenced by similar artistic documentation projects in other Arab countries.	"['For the last couple of years Sudan’s music scene has seen the rise of the stellar all-women band Salute Yal Bannot. Based in Khartoum, this group of seven women use their captivating voices to advocate for women’s rights. Harmonising and rapping in English and Arabic, they create soulful, catchy melodies with inspiring lyrics about the struggles faced by women, from FGM to self-love.\nTheir vibrant live shows have earned them a performance at the renowned TEDx event, and a place at the TV talent programme Arabs Got Talent 2017 semi-finals.\nAt a crossroads between African and Arabic cultures, Sudan has a rich and unique history of musical expression and cultural exchange. Mixing traditional ethnic rhythms with Arabic instruments like guitars, ouds and violins, modern music in Sudan also fuses jazz, hip hop and reggae.\nFemale singers became socially accepted for the first time in the 1960s, echoing the rise of girl groups in the west. Since then many have risen to popularity, like the group Al Balabil, also known as “The Nightingales“.\nAlthough the country’s music has faced repression with the establishment of strict laws in 1989, it still remains an important part of everyday life.\n“We don’t have lots of festivals or music events, like when my parents were young. So we now turn to weddings”, Hiba Elgizouli tells us. “Weddings are like festivals, you have to have an artist, no matter what it costs. Weddings are where people most enjoy music and dance”.\nHiba, one of Salute Yal Bannot’s very talented singers and songwriters, shares her experience and passion for music with NADJA.\nRespect For The Girls\nHiba’s love affair with music started when she was nine years old. Then living in Egypt, her mum enrolled her and her siblings in a multi-disciplinary art workshop to learn about drawing, singing and playing music. The moment she saw a piano, her passion for music was ignited.\n“It was the first time I really saw a piano. I remembered seeing it on TV and I just wanted to try it. When I did, I couldn’t stop myself. I immediately fell in love with the sounds it makes.”\nFrom that moment, she would wake her sister up two hours before the workshop started to go and play piano, lost in the music. She began practising singing and playing at the same time when she got her first keyboard at age fourteen.\nFour years later she went back to Sudan to go to university and study business management. She joined the university band, where she would meet future members of Salute Yal Bannot.\nSalute Yal Bannot, or “Respect For The Girls” in English, was formed in 2016, after Hiba and ten musician friends joined the Yalla Khartoum workshop, an urban arts project at the Goethe Institut. The group initially consisted of seven singers and four musicians playing drums, guitar, bass guitar, and piano. Mentored by hip hop African American artist Akua Naru, Hiba describes the experience as life-changing. Besides gaining an amazing musical experience, it transformed Hiba on a personal level.\n“I used to go on stage to sing and perform, and then I would go back home and have really bad anxiety. I couldn’t sleep well, I needed to have something to distract me”.\nEven if her performance was great and everybody, including herself, liked it, Hiba would still be picking herself to pieces. She tried many techniques to calm her anxiety but nothing worked. Until the Yalla Khartoum workshop.\n“I never told Akua I suffered from this, but somehow I was healed from it by working with her and the girls. Since then until now, I don’t have anxiety at all. It brings tears to my eyes every time I tell this story”.\nDon’t touch me\nDon’t cut me\nDon’t cut my wings away\nSalute Yal Bannot write, compose and perform their own songs. Most of them were initially created during the workshop. But since the group split into two bands a few months ago, Hiba and guitarist and songwriter Walaa Elmahi compose the songs together.\nUsually either Hiba or Walaa come up with a chorus, a verse or a concept that they will play to the band. Little by little, the other girls will add their ideas and instruments, building a song together.\nWith the band members coming from different regions of Sudan, Salute Yal Bannot’s music has diverse influences, making it unique.\n“There was a song I started writing, and I had this drum beat to it. When I described it to my musician friends, no one could get it right” says Hiba. “But when I introduced it to our drummer, she played it perfectly because the drums are from the Nuba mountains, where she is from”.\nHiba describes their music as honest. They sing openly about women’s issues such as FGM, women’s empowerment, love and respect. “Akua always told us not to be afraid of anything, we have to, and we need to express ourselves without fear”.\nBut their straightforward and outspoken style isn’t to everyone’s liking. Some musicians and corporate people from the industry don’t want to cooperate with them because “when you’re so direct, you eliminate one part of society, you eliminate men”.\nFemale singers, and female bands, have to constantly prove themselves. People are a lot more judgemental towards women musicians than men. Hiba particularly noticed it when they participated in the TV show Arabs Got Talent earlier this year.\n“Some parts of Sudanese society support men more than women. When they see a male participant in Arabs Got Talent or The Voice they are like Yaaay! There is no “he cannot sing, he is not so great, he was off-tone this whole song”. But when it’s a woman, they become experts in music”.\nI look in the mirror, I only see my flaws\nForgetting and neglecting to appreciate what God\nHas given me and blessed me with\nMy skin, my hair, my eyes,\nChanging that would be a sin\nI know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know\nWith nearly 600 ethnic groups and more than 100 languages and dialects, racism in Sudan is a daily part of life. It is deep rooted and complex due to the racial mixture of various populations. Although the name Sudan comes from “bilad al sudan”, Arabic for “the land of the blacks”, the darker you are, the more difficult it is for you, Hiba tells us.\nRacism is not only the norm in Sudanese everyday life, but a taboo subject too.\nWhen Akua addressed it during the Yalla Khartoum workshop it was a wake-up call for Hiba and the girls.\n“She brought paper and divided us into groups, and asked how we’re brought up. Four girls were brought up in either Egypt or Saudi Arabia, some in Sudan, and some have never been anywhere outside Sudan. She drew a hierarchy chart and asked where society puts us according to our tribe or skin colour.”\n“Some girls put themselves at the top, some at the bottom and some at the very bottom. She asked one of the girls who put herself at the very bottom how she felt about it. She replied: “I feel sad. I feel really sad”. That moment hit us all because we don’t really talk about these things, and they are really important.”\nThat exercise was followed by long discussions with Akua about her own experience of racism and white supremacy in America.\nIt was after this eye-opening experience that the group decided to focus on women’s issues, particularly black women’s. They want to spread positive messages about identity, unity, solidarity, and respect, and help women to build up their self-esteem.\n“Young girls and women are not confident at all. Most young ladies want to look lighter, look a particular way. It’s disturbing.” Hiba tells us. “Racism cuts the person very badly.”\n“For me, I would rather get [dirty] looks on the bus for raising my voice than for having short, nappy hair. I take the hair part more personally; it hurts me more”.\nWe’re a black and wonderful nation full of joy and\nWe’re united and not in isolation,\nWe’re strong and we say no for hesitation,\nVictory is gonna be our final destination.\nAfrican Girl is Hiba’s favourite song from Salute Yal Bannot. “The song is special to me because it brags about our identity when the world tells you that you shouldn’t brag about being black or being African.”\nImbued with a party vibe, this celebration of African Women is irresistibly catchy, and resonates with the band members as well as the public.\n“Every time we play it on stage I feel like everyone is so engaged, and we all have so much fun playing it. And people like it a lot. It’s nice when girls come to us and say our music is inspiring and makes them feel good.”\nHiba’s hopes for the future of the band? To keep producing, “writing our souls out” as she puts it, and reaching as many people as possible.\nTo all the girls and women, but also boys and men out there, Hiba wants to say:\n“You have to express yourselves. Not be afraid of anything or anyone. Expression is important.”\nMusic is a universal language that transcends cultural differences, language barriers and geographical borders. It is the most powerful expression of them all, and Salute Yal Bannot have mastered it beautifully.', ""Research on the Arts Program’s Workshop Concludes in Beirut\n28 Jan 2020\nThe Research on the Arts Program (RAP)- a joint program by the Arab Fund for Arts and Culture (AFAC) and the Arab Council for the Social Sciences (ACSS)- convened a workshop in Beirut on January 4 and 5, 2020, bringing together the recipients of the 2020 grants’ cycle and members of the jury committee.\nThe workshop was held at the ACSS offices and aimed at providing a forum for the selected grantees from five Arab countries (Sudan, Morocco, Lebanon, Tunisia and Egypt). Grantees had the opportunity to engage in critical debates and receive feedback on their research topics in open discussions with fellow grantees as well as during one-on-one meetings with RAP jurors including Walid Sadek, Jack Persekian, Maha Maamoun, Tarek El-Ariss and Driss Ksikes.\nPresentations by grantees were followed by a dynamic discussion between the researchers and the jurors around art as form of disruption as well as critical approaches and paradigms for the study of the arts. Researchers were challenged to look into dynamics that link the art with other sectors and strongly encouraged to disseminate their findings to the public. In addition, the RAP grantees benefited from a session on Research Ethics in the Social Sciences delivered by the ACSS team.\nThe participating research projects exhibited a high potential to contribute to a wide array of debates on arts - music, performing arts and cross disciplines - and politics in the Arab region. For example, in its research project entitled “Memory of Sounds and Music, Ma'amal El Sukkar St. 18”, the Egyptian research team led by Yasser Naeim seeks to unearth the cultural memory of the 1980s in Egypt as epitomized by the different artistic engagements of residents in a building in Garden City - one of Cairo’s neighborhoods. Another in-depth attempt at archiving and documentation is “Traditional Performance Arts in the North of Morocco: Documentation, Study and Presentation of Developmental and Artistic Investment Prospect” by Moroccan researcher Jamal Abarnous. In his project, Abarnous seeks to map the panoply of performances (artistic, cultural and popular such as sports matches) in Northern Morocco. Another lens on the Moroccan artistic and cultural scene was presented by the research collective ‘Racines’ led by Aadel Essaadani. The project entitled “Arts and Power: Research on the Instrumentalization of Arts and Culture in Morocco”, interrogates the efficiency of Morocco’s cultural public policies. On their part, the Tunisian team of researchers led by Anas Ghrab undertakes a research project entitled “Arabic Sources on Music” and embarks on a digitization process covering the various types of Arabic music, seeking to make them available online via an existing digital platform. The remaining two research projects burgeoned from the heart of the revolutions shaking their respective countries.\n“Artistic Action: Collective Notes” by the Lebanese collective LAAB (led by Jana Traboulsi), investigates the art practices of a Beirut-based group of cultural practitioners working in media and the arts.

37	How do indigenous peoples help preserve forests, and what threatens this?	Indigenous peoples help preserve forests through their traditional subsistence lifestyles and natural resource management practices that are less destructive than industrialized economies. There is a striking correlation between indigenous habitation and survival of natural ecosystems. However, this preservation is threatened when conservation organizations exclude indigenous peoples from their ancestral lands and when governments fail to recognize indigenous land rights, which opens territories to invasion by illegal loggers and those seeking to exploit resources for profit.	['By Martin Mowforth\nThe fact that areas inhabited by indigenous peoples are often deemed hugely important for conservation has been the focus of long-standing conflict and debate. It is estimated that 85% of designated protected areas in Central America are inhabited by indigenous peoples.\nHistorically, the colonial paradigm for conservation involved the creation of parks and protected areas. In the endeavour to preserve ‘pristine’ nature or ‘wilderness’, indigenous people were excluded from conservation programmes and even forcibly evicted from the land. It is now widely acknowledged that conservation programmes must involve the participation of the local people dependent on the areas under protection, but the feasibility of harmonising conservation and indigenous interests remains very much in dispute.\nA project undertaken by National Geographic Society in 2002, superimposed a map of indigenous territories in Central America over a map with forest cover and marine ecosystems. They found a striking correlation between indigenous habitation and the survival of natural ecosystems. That the subsistence lifestyles of indigenous peoples are less destructive to the environment than the industrialised economies of non-indigenous peoples is a reasonable assumption.\nIt is often noted that indigenous peoples have an inherent and sacred relationship with nature, a wealth of traditional knowledge, and natural resource management practices which they have been using for centuries to protect and preserve their lands. Such claims about the stewardship role of indigenous peoples strongly support the possibility of collaboration with conservation organisations for maintaining biodiversity today. Mark Dowie contends that for both parties, maintaining a “healthy and diverse biosphere” is key. Furthermore, the land and ecosystems that both conservationists and indigenous peoples are so keen to defend are seriously threatened by multiple and competing demands, including intensive agriculture, industrial forestry, and large scale development projects such as dams and mines.\nAn increasing awareness of indigenous peoples’ rights and the problems associated with the exclusionary conservation paradigm has led to attempts at more people-centred conservation programmes during the last 20 years. But, it has been suggested that there are inherent and irreconcilable differences in the agendas of indigenous people and conservationists. Whilst the former are primarily concerned for their economic wellbeing and protecting their land for their own use, the latter above all want to keep nature intact, prioritising protected areas and programmes grounded in rigorous biological and ecological science.\nThe terms of involvement of local communities have been dictated by the conservation organisations, and indigenous peoples have continued to feel excluded, and some conservationists seem to have been incapable of coping with the social aspect of these types of projects.\nMac Chapin provided a damning critique of the three largest and dominant global conservation organisations – World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Conservation International (CI) and The Nature Conservancy (TNC). He noted that their neglect of indigenous peoples in conservation programmes is partly due to their corporate and government funding and the conditions attached to it. He points out that indigenous resistance is often directed at projects executed by the organisations’ funding partners, who are also often perpetrators of environmental degradation.\nSome hardline conversationists insist that any human presence will have a negative impact on biodiversity. Kent Redford suggested that ‘the noble ecological savage’ living in harmony with nature is an over-romanticised myth of indigenous people; that in reality they are prone to deplete or over-exploit their resources.\nThere has been a recent resurgence of such a protectionist stance. Advocates of socially exclusive parks and protected areas insist that community based approaches to conservation do not offer adequate protection for endangered species and ecosystems. For example, John Oates argues that the compromise of agendas inherent in community based conservation programmes means that neither social nor conservation goals will be met.\nOthers are more optimistic and see progress made in the uncertain relationship between indigenous peoples and conservationists. Mark Dowie comments that:\n“Although tension persists, along with arrogance, ignorance and the conflicts they breed … I found, mostly in the field, a new generation of conservationists who realise that the very landscapes they seek to protect owe their high biodiversity to the practices of the people who have lived there, in some cases for thousands of years … Enlightened conservationists are beginning to accept the axiom that only by preserving cultural diversity can biological diversity be protected, and vice versa.”\nAs Kent Redford and Michael Painter point out, achieving\nsuccessful collaboration between indigenous people and conservationists is critical,\nand urgent: “while park advocates are arguing with indigenous peoples and their\nadvocates about the proper role for people in conservation, the forest they\nboth wish to preserve is being destroyed.”\n Alcorn, J.B.

WCS Working Paper No.25, Wildlife Conservation Society, New York, USA.', 'Conservation zones exclude indigenous people, drive deforestation.\nPosted on Dec 09, 2016\nWithout their traditional land managers, reserves in Central America are left vulnerable to corporate interests, report finds.\nConservation reserves in Central America have shut indigenous peoples off from their traditional lands and driven deforestation, community leaders have told Climate Home.\nSince revolution in the region started to wind down in the 1980s, there has been an internationally celebrated trend to create large conservation areas. Hundreds of thousands of square kilometres of forest have been placed within borders designed to protect them.\nBut according to a report released at a meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity in Mexico on Thursday, some of those areas have placed restrictions on the tribes who made their living in the forest through traditional, and what they say are sustainable, practices.\n“The protected areas have had a terrible impact on our people,” said Norvin Golf, the president of a coalition of Miskito tribes from Honduras. “And when you look at the maps you can see it. It is clear that on lands that we manage, the forests are standing, and where there are protected areas and no people, there is invasion and destruction.\n“By not recognising the indigenous peoples as owners of the protected areas, the government opens our territories to an invasion of people seeking to expropriate the land, destroy the forests, and turn our ancestral home into a source of money.”\nAndrew Davis, who produced the report for the Primsa Foundation, said: “Commitments to indigenous peoples look good on paper, but when you travel to the protected areas in some countries, you see government agencies using the threat of arrest and sometimes even intimidation to prevent indigenous peoples from harvesting and using resources on lands they have been conserving for hundreds of years.”\nIn October, a study compared the health of forests in South America under indigenous management and those where tenure had not been granted. It found significantly decreased rates of deforestation.\n“Indigenous people living in that area are really interested in keeping those areas well,” said Gustavo Sánchez, president of an umbrella organisation for indigenous and peasant groups in Mexico. “Because they are living there, they are living from products they get from the forests. The government don’t have the resources to make sure that this happens.”\nA map, also released on Thursday, from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) found that indigenous communities in central America occupy an area of 282,000 sq km: five times the land area of Costa Rica.\n“You cannot talk about conservation without speaking of indigenous peoples and their role as the guardians of our most delicate lands and waters,” said IUCN regional director Grethel Aguilar. “Where indigenous people live, you will find the best preserved natural resources. They depend on those natural resources to survive, and the rest of society depends on their role in safeguarding those resources for the wellbeing of us all.”\nMesoamerica, the cultural region spanning from central Mexico to Honduras, outperforms any other region when it comes to the number of tribes granted land tenure. This is partly because of the historical resilience of tribes in these areas, where they maintain a higher level of political clout than indigenous peoples elsewhere.\nIn many areas, this higher level of land tenure has translated into better access and protection. Victor Lopez, head of the Guatemalan Community Forestry Association, said the Maya Biosphere Reserve was an excellent example of the parallel paths of between cultural and environmental heritage.\nBut he said there were other cases in which conservation had compounded dispossession. He highlighted the Semuq Champey national monument, where thousands of tourists come to experience the wonder of the limestone structures along the Cahabón River – sacred to the local people.\nhose traditional owners are barred from even entering the park and visiting their own religious sites, he said. Instead they watch the tourists as they file through. Local protests have lead to violence and police repression.\nThese conflicts are partly a historical legacy, Davis’ report found. Many of the reserves were created before the link between indigenous rights and conservation was established in the mainstream. But they are also the result of continuing failure on behalf of governments to consult, said Lopez.\n“I cannot say that conservation has been successful [in general]. At these times that governments give back the rights to local people, it has been successful. But we have many conflicts around the country,” he said. “I am convinced that the main cause of that is the policy of creating in a very vertical and centralised way the protected areas without proper consultation and respectful involvement of local people, both indigenous and multicultural people.”\nThe Mexican, Guatemalan and Honduran governments did not respond to requests for comment.\nSánchez also said that there were many successful examples of integration between protected areas and indigenous people in Mexico. But that there were troubling examples of landowners being shut out. This includes the famed Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve, where the migratory insects overwinter.\nThe report said that local communities in that area had been placed under tight restrictions and disqualified from their traditional practices of selective logging and are instead directed what crops to farm.\n“The problem is that when indigenous people’s rights are taken away from the land that they are preserving and protecting they lose interest in protecting and conserving those areas. So you lose control of those areas of forest and the amount of personnel that the government has to protect those areas is not enough,” said Sánchez.\nThis gap in stewardship allows illegal loggers to operate, he said. Deforestation in the reserve tripled in recent years.\n“By excluding us, the government allows the invasion of the lands, and the theft of the biodiversity they want to protect,” said Golf.\nReposted from Climate Home']	['<urn:uuid:85abb1a6-78ce-476a-9e08-38fa668afc5d>', '<urn:uuid:043fa1d2-5a7e-4ed5-9f79-068e52d47e56>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	11	75	1894
38	Which medical treatments came from heart versus brain cell research?	The heart cell research has led to more immediate clinical applications compared to brain research. From heart studies, researchers developed VentriGel, a material that prevents cardiac muscle death after heart attacks and has advanced to planned clinical trials in Europe. Additionally, injectable materials and tissue engineering approaches are being developed for heart repair. The brain cell research, while still primarily investigational, is working toward developing neural prosthetics for quadriplegics to control wheelchairs or computer cursors through thought, though these applications haven't yet reached clinical trials. Both areas are investigating flexible, stretchable electrodes as potential therapeutic implants.

To answer these, let us ask, what do bio- and biomedical engineers do? Engineers measure components of systems with existing techniques or develop new technologies, understand the design principles of the system, develop a quantitative model, and study the behavior of the system through the model by introducing perturbations. Thus, they are able to build similar systems that can provide similar and different input-response characteristics and lead to innovation. Bioengineers apply these principles to living systems. The end goal is societal and economic benefit, which goes beyond merely satisfying intellectual curiosity.\nThe article traces the evolution of Bioengineering Program at UCSD from its beginning in 1966 with work on the application of mechanical engineering principles in physiology. Mention is made of the role of the Whitaker Foundation, which supported the building of bio- and biomedical engineering across the country. Tissue engineering has been, and contrinues to be, a strong focus of the program.\nNine current bioengineering research areas at UCSD are highlighted in the article. They are only briefly mentioned in this overview. Refer to the complete article for more information.\n(1) First is the work of Dr. Karen Christman and the members of her group, who have been exploring the use of injectable materials to prevent heart failure after a myocardial infarction. Dr. Christman says that a material, termed VentriGel, ""appears to prevent further cardiac muscle death, and we saw evidence of stem cells coming into the area of the heart that had been damaged."" This work has led to a commercial company planning clinical trials of the material in Europe.\n(2) Dr. Shyni Varghese\'s laboratory has been studying stem cell and biomaterials based therapies for treating various musculoskeletal tissue damages. Her laboratory has developed a self-healing hydrogel that binds in seconds, as easily as Velcro, and forms a bond strong enough to withstand repeated stretching. The material has numerous potential applications, including medical sutures, targeted drug delivery, industrial sealants, and self-healing plastics.\n(3) Professor Adam Engler and his team have been investigating the in vivo microenvironments that make it difficult to mimic development with functional engineered tissue constructs or engineered ""smart cells."" His group explores how these microenvironments affect stem cell niches. Their work with stem cells derived from fat, they suggest, could hint at new therapeutic possibilities for muscular dystrophy (MD).\n(4) A 200-patient Phase 2 clinical pilot study was initiated in May 2012 to test the efficacy and safety of a new use and method of administering an enzyme inhibitor for critically ill patients developed by UCSD Department of Bioengineering Professor Geert Schmidt-Schoenbein. Conditions expected to qualify for the study include new-onset sepsis and septic shock, postoperative complications, and new-onset gastrointestinal bleeding. In 2005, the team\'s protocol was licensed a development- stage, critical care start-up company.\n(5) Dr. Todd Coleman\'s lab works on brain-machine interfaces. In cooperation with Dr. John Rogers at the University of Illinois at Champaign/Urbana, they have developed a class of flexible skin-mounted electronics (Figure A) that can be embedded in a temporary tattoo (Figure B). These tattoo sensors that can sense and wirelessly transmit multiple modalities (electrical, temperature, mechanical, and optical).\nFigure A.

Palsson and his laboratory have developed genome-scale models of microbes that have revolutionized our understanding of microbial function and are paving the way for a variety of basic and applied research programs from engineering drugs from microbes to making bio-fuels. Palsson\'s laboratory built the first complete model of an E. coli organism.\n(7) Research from a new bioengineering faculty member, Dr. Christian Metallo, demonstrates that our cells metabolize nutrients in a different manner than has long been thought. ""We\'re exploring how metabolism controls how our cells function,"" said Metallo. ""Dysfunctional metabolism is a very important driver of disease, but we often don\'t understand the details of what\'s going inside the cells and how we can fix the problems that arise when our cells and body are sick. The metabolic pathways we are studying are used by virtually all the cells in our body, so these results actually impact our understanding of metabolism in many different tissues and diseases.""\n(8) To better understand how biological clocks are synchronised at the molecular level, Dr. Jeff Hasty created a model biological system consisting of glowing, blinking E. coli bacteria. This simple circadian system allowed Hasty and his team to study in detail how a population of cells synchronizes their biological clocks and enabled the researchers for the first time to describe this process mathematically. To simulate day and night cycles, the researchers modified the bacteria to glow and blink whenever arabinose - a chemical that triggered the oscillatory clock mechanisms of the bacteria - was flushed through the microfluidic chip. This knowledge could have important future applications because scien- tists have discovered that problems with the biological clock can result in many common medical problems ranging from diabetes to sleep disorders.\n(9) Dr. Shankar Subramaniam and colleagues have offered the sharpest-yet picture of how core biochemical pathways in skeletal muscle cells and fat cells are altered in people who suffer from insulin resistance - a primary defect in type 2 diabetes and obesity. They have identified major inflammatory and immune regulation pathways that are impaired in insulin resistance that is not addressed by standard treatments. They state that the ability to differentiate between responders and nonresponders to drugs can only be done at a systems level, and this is the quest of quantitative systems pharmacology.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR', ""The cells of the heart can be stretched by as much as 100 percent with every beat. But traditional platforms for studying cells are static, limiting researchers’ ability to study these cells in a realistic way in the lab. Now researchers at Purdue University and Stanford University have developed stretchable electrode arrays for studying these cells. These arrays should help develop tissue-engineered grafts to repair the damage caused by heart attacks, and could serve as bio-friendly electrical interfaces in implantable devices. They’re also being used to study how the mechanical stress inflicted during traumatic brain injury changes neurons’ electrical activity over the long term.\nThe new system, developed by a team led by Babak Ziaie, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue, consists of a stretchy polymer containing a small array of gold-coated pins. These pins act as microelectrodes that can send and record electrical signals. In the past, the difficulty in designing these electrode arrays has been developing electrical connections for the electrodes that can be stretched without degrading their performance. In the Purdue system, electrical current is carried to and from the electrodes by a liquid metal alloy that flows through channels within the polymer.\nThe stretchy electrode arrays maintain their electrical properties better than any flexible electrode previously developed. Using a liquid alloy means that resistance to electrical current does not drop when the array is stretched.\nThis makes them a useful tool for studying and stimulating cardiac cells, says Rebecca Taylor, one of the Stanford researchers working on the project. The heart’s muscle cells receive regular electrical stimulation that causes them to beat. They also experience regular mechanical stresses caused by the beating of the tissue around them. These stimuli tell heart cells to keep acting like heart cells, so mimicking them in the lab is an important first step toward engineering tissue to repair the damage caused by heart attacks or congenital heart defects.\nTaylor says that the new electrodes make it possible to stretch and stimulate heart-muscle cells in vitro: “You trick them into thinking they’re in the heart.” These long, beating muscle cells normally lose their shape after about a day in culture, growing still and pulling into small, round shapes. The Stanford researchers’ first goal is to use the stretchy, electrically stimulating cell platform to maintain the cells in their normal state. After that, they plan to use the approach to grow patches of healthy heart tissue for reparative grafts.\nAnother team of researchers, at Columbia University and Princeton University, are using stretchable electrode arrays to study traumatic brain injury (TBI). This kind of injury results from an acute event like a car accident or a battlefield explosion, but the ill effects grow much worse over the long term as cells in the brain react to the injury by changing their gene-expression patterns, and subsequently their electrical activity. So the hope is that better understanding how mechanical stresses lead to molecular changes in the brain could, in turn, lead to life-saving therapies. “The deformation of brain tissue sets into motion cellular signaling cascades that take some time to develop; very often, that’s what kills you,” says Barclay Morrison, a biomedical engineer at Columbia. Morrison is studying TBI in the lab using stretchable electrodes developed by Sigurd Wagner, a professor of electrical engineering at Princeton.\nIn Wagner’s electrode arrays, thin gold electrical contacts printed using standard lithography techniques play the same role as Ziaie’s liquid alloy contacts. These electrodes do experience a spike in resistance when stretched, but this lasts less than a second, says Morrison. The stretchiness of the electrodes allows the Columbia team to inflict TBI-like mechanical stress on neurons grown in culture, and monitor their electrical activity over the long term.\n“One of the big issues right now in TBI is that we aren’t sure of the thresholds of injury,” says Kevin Kit Parker, a U.S. Army Reserve captain and a biomedical-engineering professor at Harvard University. Electrodes like those being developed by Ziaie and Morrison “would allow us to precisely determine what kind of blast forces are required to acutely disrupt the electrical activity in the brain,” Parker says.\nMorrison says that his studies have shown that TBI-like damage can be initiated in cells grow in the lab by a 10 percent strain inflicted over 50 milliseconds. In a forthcoming paper to be published in the Journal of Neurotrauma, he and Wagner describe the effects of simulated trauma on cells from different regions of the brain. “We’ve shown that, depending on the brain region, cell death is responsive to the rate and magnitude of stretch,” says Morrison.\nOver the long term, the researchers hope that stretchable electrode arrays will prove suitable for more than just studying cells, and can be used to make implantable devices for studying and treating disease. Morrison says that stretchable electrodes may prove friendlier interfaces for neural prosthetics that connect to the brain, such as implants that allow quadriplegics to control their wheelchair or use a cursor on a computer screen just by thinking about it. Because these implants are flexible, they ought to cause less scarring than a rigid silicon chip. Scarring interferes with the performance of an implant.\nStretchable electrode arrays also show promise as an electrical interface to other kinds of muscle. A compliant electrode array wrapped around the smooth muscles of the bladder might be used to send electrical signals that allow the muscle to move again, helping to treat patients suffering from incontinence.\nThe dark secret behind those cute AI-generated animal images\nGoogle Brain has revealed its own image-making AI, called Imagen.

39	What was the key to ending the war in Europe?	The Allied 'Hundred Days Offensive' in autumn 1918 finally broke through the Hindenburg Line - a 100-mile-long trench system with concrete bunkers, barbed wire, minefields, machine guns and tunnels. With its defenses fatally breached, Germany acknowledged defeat and signed the armistice a month later.	['A state with a strong martial tradition, South Carolina provided as many soldiers for service during World War I as the state had for the Confederate army a half-century earlier. With America’s entry into the war in 1917, the state once more underwent a mobilization of manpower and resources of titanic proportions.\nAs the United States entered the great European war, the nation formed unprecedented alliances with European powers and took on a new and daunting role on the world stage. For the state of South Carolina, the federalization of its National Guard and the state’s commitment to the national war effort were drastic steps marking a shift of perspective from regional to international affairs.\nMexican Border Campaign\nWhile the European powers struggled for supremacy, another war raged much closer to home. Revolutionary factions struggled for the control of Mexico, and President Woodrow Wilson’s administration watched events south of the Rio Grande with growing alarm. When the town of Columbus, New Mexico was raided by revolutionaries under Mexican leader Pancho Villa, Wilson mobilized state militia troops to protect American citizens and property in the Southwest.\nFor South Carolina troops, this security duty along the Mexican border provided a significant prologue to World War I. South Carolina troops served alongside the regular U.S. Army, safeguarding United States citizens and property against Pancho Villa’s marauding revolutionaries.\nDuring the Punitive Expedition, the state volunteer system was employed for the last time, with each state’s troops serving in their state militia regiments. When the same troops were called up for World War I, they would be reorganized, their units redesignated and made part of the regular army.\nMobilization and Draft\nUpon their return from the border intervention, South Carolina’s citizen-soldiers soon found themselves preparing for deployment to France. When war with Germany was declared in April, South Carolina’s troops were called up for the defense of the state. That summer, however, they were summoned into federal service. In the reorganization that followed the activation of the National Guard for federal service, the 1st South Carolina Regiment became the 118th Infantry. Assigned to the 30th (“Old Hickory”) Division, the 118th would become one of the most distinguished regiments of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF).\nActivation of the National Guard on July 25, 1917 doubled the size of the U.S. Army, but even this expansion was insufficient to realistically affect the course of the war in Europe.\nAnother more controversial policy followed: the national draft. For the first time since the desperate days of the Confederacy, South Carolina men were subject to conscription. Draftees were organized into the national army, distinguished from both the regular army and the National Guard. This national army also included the segregated troops of the 93rd Division, whose 371st Regiment was composed primarily of African-American South Carolinians.\nSouth Carolina citizens would also serve in great numbers in many other units, including the 81st\n(“Wildcat”) and 42nd (“Rainbow”) Divisions. They would be found among the U.S Marines and Navy sailors serving overseas, as well.\nMore than two million black U.S. males between 21 and 31 registered for conscription. Even though they represented 10 percent of the total draft registration, there were only four “Buffalo Soldier” regiments in the U.S. Army to take in these new soldiers, and none of those regiments were slated for AEF service. With some reluctance, the U.S. War Department agreed to create the 93rd Division in the national army.\nThe 93rd Division contained four regiments: the 369th, 370th, 371st and 372nd. The 371st formed at Camp Jackson in August 1917 and was the only regiment in the 93rd Division formed primarily of draftees. The 371st, unlike the other regiments, consisted mainly of African-Americans from across the South.\nUpon arrival in France, the 93rd Division’s regiments found themselves “on loan” to America’s allies. Starved for replacements and long accustomed to employing African colonial troops, the French army eagerly took in the black American soldiers. American commanding General “Black Jack” Pershing, whose nickname referred to his Buffalo Soldier service in the Spanish-American War, agreed to this arrangement, perhaps to help mollify the French demand for recruits.\nIn the Trenches\nUnited States troops arriving in France were immediately coveted by the other Allied powers, who wanted replacements for their own horrifying losses. General Pershing, following President Woodrow Wilson’s orders, insisted on the American Expeditionary Forces’ independent existence and national chain of command.\nThe fighting in France was characterized by great lines of fortification dug into the earth, where armies maneuvered in small spaces constricted by artillery and swept by machine gun fire. Thousands of lives might be expended for a gain of a few hundred yards of territory, a gain that was quite likely to be temporary, as the enemy regrouped in a further line of entrenchments to mount a counterattack.\nThe infantryman of the late 19th century relied on his rifle and was expected to march into battle, but in this environment, the machine gun dominated long-range fighting and the line tactics of previous generations were suicidal. Trench raids, on the other hand, often devolved into pistol and hand grenade contests where a “trench sweeper” shotgun could prove superior to more conventional long arms. At any range, Western Front fighting was a brutal contest of attrition and had settled into a deadlock that the American Expeditionary Forces would help to break.\nAdding to the danger and misery was the constant threat of attack by poison gas. Gas warfare originated as an attempt to break the deadlock in the trenches, but soon became just another horrific feature of life on the front. First Sergeant Joseph Etheredge, who served in South Carolina’s Field Hospital Number One (119th Field Hospital, 30th Division), graphically described the effects of a gas attack:\n“In being gassed by Mustard Gas, your throat commences burning as if you have taken a swallow of red-hot lead, your eyes commence burning and swelling shut as if a hive of bees had stung you, your voice goes from you till you can scarcely whisper, and you have a tremendous pressure on your chest as if there is a weight of from 50 to 100 pounds there… It was about five weeks from the time I was gassed before I was able to turn over, and in fact it was about Armistice Day when I began to sit up a little.”\nArtillery and Aviation\nWorld War I would see the first large-scale use of aircraft for military purposes. Used at first for reconnaissance, the aircraft soon found other roles as well. As the use of aircraft proved advantageous, control of the skies was contested and the romanticized “Flying Aces” in their swift fighter planes attracted public notice. Meanwhile, the less glamorous reconnaissance flyers provided vital intelligence to the commanders on the ground, proving the worth of the airplane permanently. By the time American troops arrived in France, aircraft were a major component of wartime strategy on both sides.\nAlthough the machine gun is the weapon most often associated with trench warfare, it was actually the massed artillery of the Western Front that caused the most casualties. The role of artillery in the First World War is difficult to overemphasize, both in its direct results and in the demoralizing effect of continuous bombardment.\nSophisticated techniques were employed to isolate enemy units and to prepare the ground for infantry advances, and the landscape of the battlefields was drastically altered by the storms of high explosives unleashed by the big guns. The artillery also delivered the gas attacks, which proved to be yet another innovation to break the bloody stalemate of static trench warfare.\nMany Allied military planners anticipated the continuation of the Western Front stalemate well into 1919, and American troops began the war on the defensive as the German army attacked. However, the German army, weakened by four years of war, was more vulnerable than it appeared, and the American troops would soon provide critical assistance in bringing the long, bloody conflict to its conclusion.\nThe Allied “Hundred Days Offensive” in the autumn of 1918 finally collapsed an important section of the German defenses, and South Carolina’s soldiers were in the forefront with a historic assault on the Hindenburg Line. This 100-mile-long trench system across northeastern France was fortified with concrete bunkers, barbed wire, minefields, interlocking machine gun positions and tunnels that allowed German reinforcements to move to threatened sections in relative safety.\nIn an attack that lasted from September 18 to October 5, 1918, British, Australian and American forces broke through and cleared the entire Hindenburg Line. With its defenses fatally breached, Germany acknowledged defeat, and the war ended with the signing of the armistice a month later. South Carolina soldiers were in the forefront of this historic assault. Soldiers of the 30th Division, including the 118th Infantry Regiment, won particular praise for their part in the battle.\nThe heroism of the men of the 118th, 371st and South Carolina’s other battlefield units helped drive the final advance that forced an armistice and an end to World War I. South Carolina’s Adjutant General Moore expressed a common hope in his annual report for 1918 when he said that the year “in all human probability will go down into future history as the culmination of the world’s greatest war.” Certificates issued by President Wilson would acclaim America’s “Great War” soldiers as “The Chivalry of a New Humanity,” and the surviving soldiers returned to their homes with hopes for a lasting peace.\nCourtesy of the South Carolina Historical Society']	['<urn:uuid:4ce4649e-ee30-49c3-8c95-a0b9d2d37457>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	10	44	1585
40	gallup poll presidential election sample size	A national Gallup poll about a presidential election typically has 1500 respondents.	['We now have unparalleled access to enormous amounts of data, automatically generated and gathered, which represent sample sizes that are nearly impossible to replicate with traditional survey methods. People excitedly tell us that many major equity issues, particularly representation issues, will be a thing of the past now that we can leverage these massive data sets.\nAt We All Count, we agree that Big Data is a valuable resource but we think there are some very important concerns that Big Data alone won’t fix. We think that what’s really exciting about Big Data is the ability to combine the efficiency and power of large datasets with the intentionality of small, curated data samples.\nWhat is Big Data?\nThe term ‘Big Data’ gets thrown around a lot with varying definitions. Is the U.S. Census big data? It is a large and comprehensive data set. Are large, international data sets amalgamated from a variety of sources, like U.N. or World Bank datasets, Big Data? Is live data from a mid-sized phone app Big Data, because it has a lot of data points?\nFor our purposes, we’re going to define Big Data as: datasets that are really huge – measured in terabytes not gigabytes – containing automatically generated data points like online behaviour, purchases, live locations, ‘likes’, searches, etc. Think Google, Facebook, Amazon. Think Chase Bank, Mastercard, Walmart. Think Uber, AT&T, Netflix.\nThese are the kind of datasets that have massive disruptive implications for our world. They are a shift in what’s possible on the scale of the Industrial Revolution. They also have some major equity issues.\nBig Data Power\nIn data science, the statistical strength of a given analysis is often limited or supported by the sample size. If you want to find answers to a question about an entire population, you need to get data about a statistically relevant percentage of that population. Large samples are inherently expensive, making answers about huge groups of people very difficult to achieve. Much of the focus of modern statistics has been discovering and refining statistical methods to achieve high statistical reliability. This research has also confirmed that the quality of your sample matters equally to its quantity.\nImagine that you want to find out if people in your town prefer shopping at Walmart or online. For the same cost, you can either survey a well randomized sample of 100 people across your town, or you can camp out in the Walmart parking lot and ask 1000 respondents. You can clearly see that simply increasing sample size without any regard to equitable representation would dramatically skew your results.\nAlong comes Big Data, and we suddenly have enormous sample sizes available to us. Instead of using a tiny fraction of the entire population, Big Data offers us huge slices of our population to use as samples. For example a national Gallup poll about a presidential election might have 1500 respondents, (keep in mind that these respondents are very carefully selected and the statistical methodology used to interpret those results is very robust) while Facebook has live data available on around 244 million Americans. That’s a sample over 100,000 times larger.\nThe statistical strength that you can achieve with such an enormous sample size, paired with the up-to-the-minute nature of a lot of this data can make it feel like we can answer statistical questions with an almost prophetic certainty. Smaller companies, local governments and NGOs are incredibly eager to harness the power of Big Data, and rightly so as it can offer incredible insight into policy decisions, impact studies and effectiveness. The tricky part is that Big Data is always collected with a specific intention and by a collector with a specific mandate. Nine times out of ten that mandate is to make money.\nBig Data fans see it as a silver bullet to equity issues due to its scale and its inhuman indifference to most equity issues. Amazon’s data collection algorithms are being adjusted to maximize profits, not to maximize sales to a certain race or gender. If Walmart discovered it’s data collection process was ignoring all potential female customers, it would be changed immediately. Also with a data set that might say include 30% of all U.S. citizens, it’s easy to feel like the sample size is so large that it must include at least some representation of all types of people in the population.\nTwo Issues with Big Data and Equity\nAmazon generates data about Amazon customers. Phone apps generate data about people who own smartphones. Uber has data about people who ride in Ubers. Big data has an inherent representation problem when compared to a well crafted traditional sample: it automatically doesn’t include the people it isn’t concerned with.\nAdditionally, because the sample sizes are so large, Big Data concentrates the impact of the most prolific data providers. That means if you shop a lot on Amazon and take a lot of Uber rides, your data is being counted way more than someone who only has the resources to do those things occasionally, or never.\nSo representation and weight are two challenges to overcome with Big Data. Businesses have a mandate to make money, so that’s alright for them but how can someone who also cares about finding equitable solutions use this data?\nThe Best of Both Worlds\nLet’s pretend you are the local government of the city of Toronto. You want to know where to expand your subway system. What new location makes the most sense for the greatest number of Torontonians? You have a very large dataset from your ‘swipe card’ entry system, so you can see all kinds of data from people on the subway, street cars and busses. You’d like to also supplement your information with Uber’s massive dataset: this will allow you to see a huge sample of citizens and where they are using a form of transportation other than transit.\nYou know that both of your Big Datasets don’t represent everyone, you don’t have info on people who take neither transit or ubers, like drivers, pedestrians or people who can’t afford either option. You also know that these data sets concentrate the impact of the most frequent users and will have to make sure you account for that statistically. You have a limited budget and you could spend it on an expensive but rigorous survey that gets good representation but a smaller sample size, or you could use the money to access Uber’s massive and statistically significant dataset, even if there are some equity issues, you might get a more firm answer to your question.\nOr you can harness the power of both. What Big Data offers is amazing efficiency. Yes it is expensive to operate the massive systems that collect, store and analyse such a huge volume of data but the cost per data point is many orders of magnitude cheaper than traditional survey methods. These savings can be used to supplement Big Datasets and fill in representational gaps using additional statistical methods. We can use the money saved to conduct a smaller, more targeted survey that can get answers specifically from people who aren’t represented by our Big Data.\nWe can use the Transit Data, the Uber Data and conduct our own research in a more targeted way to make sure we’re making the fairest decision for all stakeholders, without ignoring the predictive or authoritative power of the large datasets. Ignoring Big Data today is like ignoring steam engines in favor of a horse and cart, the difference in power and efficiency is inarguable. On the other hand assuming that Big Data will automatically solve equity issues when it wasn’t designed to do so is wishful thinking. By focusing on equity and using the power of rigorous statistical methodology to flesh out and re-weight Big Data, we can have the best of both worlds.']	['<urn:uuid:9c5c84ab-420b-471e-bbb2-7afdd5eb4eab>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	6	12	1310
41	first lighthouse great lakes east lansing library mural compare locations	The locations differ - according to the Michigan Folklore mural at East Lansing Public Library, there is no mention of the first Great Lakes lighthouse there, while historical records show it was built at Point Mississauga at the mouth of the Niagara River in Ontario.	"[""The East Lansing Public Library is home to a fascinating mural, created by the late author and painter Dirk Gringhuis.\nGringhuis, an East Lansing author and painter, contributed the Michigan Folklore mural to the East Lansing Public Library. After doing research in depth, he painted the mural and wrote the legend about our folklore.\nDirk's first books included Hope Haven, Tuliptime, and Here Comes the Bookmobile. In 1952 he moved to East Lansing, where he completed his first junior novel, The Young Voyageur, a story of early fur trading in Michigan. Two of Gringhuis' books were published by the Michigan State University Press.\nLegends from the mural\n1. Beginning of the earth: Algonquin Indian Legend\nThe Chief of Heaven was angry. His wife, Sky Woman, was peering down through the hole in heaven where once the Tree of Life had stood.\nIn a rage, he pushed her through and she fell toward the sea below. Then he threw plants of corn and squash, and animals such as the rabbit, the raccoon and the skunk.\nBut the ocean animals saw her falling and hurried to help. The great birds made a canopy of their wings and bore her safely down while the Great Snapping Turtle held his mighty shell above water for a landing place. Others, the muskrat, beaver and toad, brought up earth from the sea bottom and piled it high on the turtle’s back to make land.\nSky Woman and the animals landed safely.\nThen as plants and trees and animals prospered, the earth grew and she became the Earth Mother.\n2. The race: Chippewa Indian Legend\nNanabojo and his evil trickster brother, Peepaukawis, ran a foot race. Wherever Peepaukawis ran, snow and sleet fell. But under the moccasins of Nanabojo, new grasses and flowers sprang up. Birds sang squirrels and rabbits frisked happily in front of him.\nAt last, Nanabojo was far ahead of his brother and there was summer across Michigan. Tired, he lay down to sleep. Suddenly the cold winds of autumn swept down upon him as his brother dashed by.\nHe leapt to his feet, ice already forming on his moccasins and ran with all his might. For a brief time he passed his brother while Indian summer covered the land. Then he fell exhausted and as Nanabojo slept, his brother Peepaukawis ran far ahead and winter took over.\nNow when the weather changes suddenly it is because the brothers are racing to see who will win.\n3. The ghost ship: Great Lakes Fishermen’s Legend\nThe Griffon, first sailing ship on the Great Lakes, was built in 1679 by LaSalle. Designed to carry furs and trade goods she failed to return from her maiden voyage and apparently went down with all hands.\nNow she is only seen as a ghost, skirting the shores of the Straits of Mackinac, under full sail.\n4. Nain Rouge: Early French Legend\nThe Red Dwarf was seen often in old French Detroit. And when Cadillac, founder of Fort Detroit, saw the dwarf he tried to strike it and missed. Thereafter Cadillac was the victim of many misfortunes. When Detroit burned in 1805 the same dwarf was seen again. It is said that some citizens in Grosse Pointe still mark their houses with the sign of the cross to break the Red Dwarf’s evil spell. Nain Rouge is pictured against a French fort and trader’s house.\n5. The Tommy Knockers: Early English Legend\nThese little dwarfs were brought to the mines of Michigan by Cornish miners around 1850. Given to impish pranks, the Tommy Knockers also warned miners of impending cave-ins or other danger by knocking on the tunnel walls with their hammers. This is where they got their names.\n6. Paul Bunyan and\n7. Babe the Blue Ox: Loggers Legend\nPaul, the giant logger, represents the colorful days of lumbering in Michigan. He is pictured in front of a strand of white pine which has cut into squared logs with four strokes of his axe. Another slice then “harvested” an entire row of logs. Ahead, Babe, his companion, moves down across Michigan hauling an entire logging camp across the snow. Babe measured 42 axe handles and a tobacco box between his horns and his huge hooves dug the Great Lakes.\n8. Johnny Appleseed: Early Settlers’ Legend\nJohn Chapman, known as Johnny Appleseed, was born in Massachusetts in 1801 and arrived in the Ohio Territory and then into what is now Michigan scattering apple seeds and good deeds wherever he went.

In 1804, John Symington, under orders from Lieutenant-Governor Peter Hunter, built a hexagonal stone lighthouse and a log lightkeeper's dwelling. The station was funded by a duty on cargo collected by Upper Canada in support of aids to navigation. Although the lighthouse was demolished in 1814 to make room for Fort Mississauga, its materials, with debris from the ruined town of Newark, now Niagara-on-the- Lake, were incorporated into the fort's tower.\nDescription of Historic Place\nLocated on the shoreline of the Niagara River in Niagara-on the-Lake, Ontario, Mississauga Point Lighthouse National Historic Site of Canada marks the site of the first lighthouse built on the Great Lakes in 1804. While archaeological remains are believed to be situated below what is now the eastern mortar bastion of Fort Mississauga National Historic Site of Canada, no aboveground evidence survives.

42	What should artists think about when painting on buildings?	Several key points are important when creating murals: north-facing walls are best, walls must be cleaned and primed first, artists should avoid fluorescent colors as they fade quickly, use quality paints, apply protective coating layers with UV absorbers, and create a maintenance plan. It's also important to get involved with the community and consult with conservators when in doubt. Using better products initially is more cost-effective than having to repaint or conserve the mural later.	['Amanda Norbutus is in the Preservation Studies doctoral program at the University of Delaware, and has her undergraduate and master’s degrees in chemistry. Her presentation first outlined the state of public murals preservation and the issues faced today, then described current research into protective coatings for public murals and discussed a case study of a mural by Meg Saligman in Philadelphia that has been successfully treated.\nThe “Contemporary Mural Movement” refers to public murals produced since the 1960s (see cool book) and Amanda noted that there are more than 350 public art programs across the US that have facilitated the production of these murals. The murals often address themes of heritage and social and political equality. Loss and damage are rampant for a number of reasons: the murals are often spontaneous, not planned with long term preservation in mind; they are subject to extreme outdoor conditions; and they suffer from a lack of funding – while money is pledged for their production, none is usually allocated for preservation. The murals often also fall under various jurisdictional disputes – no one is quite sure who is responsible, or who has the right to make decisions about the wall or the image. To address some of these issues, Heritage Preservation has a program called Rescue Public Murals which carries out identification, documentation and conservation of murals, provides a network for those working on their preservation and researching best practice for mural production and conservation, and conducts fundraising (you can sign up here to get on RPM’s mailing list). They also have a partnership with ARTstor Digital Library to preserve images of murals, as not all can be physically preserved; there is a Community Murals collection in ARTStor. Amanda noted one prominent case in which Ken Twitchell, an artist who had painted a mural (Homage to Ed Ruscha) on a federal government-owned downtown LA building, received a $1.1 million settlement after the mural had been painted over.\nA few of the biggest problems facing murals are graffiti, physical destruction, and desaturation as the paint layers weather and are exposed to UV. UV radiation causes cracking, color change and fading. Oxidation chain reactions are the culprit on a chemical level. Research has been ongoing to look into protective UV barrier coatings. Some limitations are – scale, access, acceptability by stakeholders, safety (VOC’s), and ease of application. Some of the categories examined include acrylics, waxes, polyurethanes, and silanes.\nIn a study that began in 2005 at Delaware, Jessica Keister painted out more than 700 samples of blue, yellow and red colors of various types of paints from Golden, Novacolor, and Keim, in addition to some fluorescent colors. As coatings, she looked at B72 with Tinuvin, Novacolor, Golden MSA varnish, and a Triangle Triton coating (not reversible). The samples were placed on the roof and exposed to weather for three years. In 2008, Amanda began looking at the samples, noting the differences between colors – Hansa yellows did best – and paint systems – Golden heavy bodied acrylics did best. Golden MSA varnish seemed to protect the samples best – the Triangle coating was better at keeping mold and dirt off the surface, but its irreversiblity deducted crucial points from its usefulness. There was some success with B72 and Tinuvin (UV stabilizer), and in general two coats worked best of the protective layers. Amanda noted that products commercially sold as UV protective are not always so – she cited a test done by muralist Ed Massey on an industrial polymer coating that was purported to have a UV stabilizer, which failed completely. Finally, there needs to be more research into reversibility on a practical level, whether coatings can be effectively removed without affecting damaged paint beneath. Here’s more detail from Amanda about the parameters of the samples on an RPM blog post from 2008.\nThe Meg Saligman mural in Philadelphia is called Common Threads (1998), and when RPM assessed it in 2009 it was extremely faded. The artist didn’t want to repaint it, as she felt she would change it too much. Together with RPM and Winterthur Art Conservation faculty and students, the artist agreed to apply a coating of Golden MSA – but they had to get an exception from the EPA to use it on such a large scale. Applied after surface cleaning, this coating resaturated the colors significantly. They also then did some retinting with Sher-Cryl (Sherwin williams acrylic) and pigments (envirotint?) over the coating, then applied another layer of the Golden coating.\nA key point is to work with muralists to prevent some of these problems from the get-go. Amanda noted that when doing this it’s important to address the bottom line – money – and emphasize that in the long run it is cheaper to use better products first rather than having to repaint or conserve a mural later.\nShe ended with a summary of other key points to remember when working with murals/muralists:\n- Get involved with the community\n- North facing walls are best\n- Clean and prime the wall first (amazing but often not done!)\n- Choose the right palette – no fluorescents, they fade fast!\n- Use quality paints\n- Use a coating layers\n- Use a UV absorber\n- Create a maintenance and monitoring plan\n- Consult with conservators and scientists when in doubt']	['<urn:uuid:62af6797-af03-4f38-b2fb-1ab5dd7f132e>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	9	75	888
43	Could you explain what kinds of problems a company might face if they don't follow good ethical practices, even if they're not breaking any laws?	While unethical decisions are not necessarily illegal, they can lead to several negative outcomes: reputational harm, boycotts by customers, increased scrutiny, and other negative consequences. Some examples of activities that can be seen as unethical include poor treatment of employees, avoidance of tax obligations through loopholes, lack of regard for consumers or the natural environment, irresponsible or misleading marketing, and business practices that appear unfair even if legal. A specific example is Nestle's controversy regarding baby formula marketing in developing nations, which has led to boycotts and criticism since the 1970s, including recent criticism in 2018 for inaccurate marketing descriptions.	"[""Ethics come into play when making decisions for so many individuals, businesses and organizations, yet sometimes the concept is taken for granted. We know ethics — moral principles that inform actions and behaviors — are valuable, but how do they apply to businesses, the economy, and your career?\nA deeper understanding of the importance of business ethics can empower you to make morally sound decisions in your career, support your employer’s efforts to address controversial topics, and build better relationships with your customers and the community.\nA closer look at the following topics can support a firmer grasp of ethics in a general sense and how they specifically apply to the world of business:\n- The role of ethics in society and decision-making.\n- The importance of consistent ethics in business leadership (and the damage their absence can cause).\n- Key considerations for building an ethical company culture.\nEthics as a Foundation for Sound Decisions\nDistinguishing between help and harm, right and wrong, and similar concepts is crucial for successful participation in society. That’s true for individuals as well as organizations. Let’s start by taking a closer look at ethical and unethical behavior:\n- Ethical behavior demonstrates a commitment to considering the needs of others, as well as their basic autonomy as sentient living creatures. This sort of respect and consideration is both expected in certain contexts as well as appreciated when offered.\n- Unethical behavior shows a disregard for others — a lack of caring about their safety and security. Unethical actions can cause others to distance themselves from a person who acts in such a fashion, or for customers to stop supporting a business.\nThe Difference Between Ethics and Laws\nLaws and regulations generally align with the basic ethical principles that most of society believes to be true. Prohibiting actions like theft, assault, and fraud through the threat of fines, arrest, and other penalties aligns with commonly held views.\nHowever, ethics and laws are not identical, despite this connection. Ethics are principles that help guide people and groups through decisions but are not universally held or followed. They can vary from one person, organization, or location to the next. Laws are codified rules that everyone in a specific jurisdiction is expected to follow.\nThe St. Bonaventure University Code of Conduct offers some additional clarity on this concept in its Statement of Purpose: “As members of the St. Bonaventure University community, the University expects students to act in congruence with not only New York State and Federal Laws, but also their own personal values, and the values of our Franciscan tradition.”\nIn practical terms, you can view laws as a baseline — the rules to which everyone must adhere. Ethics go beyond this requirement, serving as a guide for people and businesses to make decisions in situations where a law or regulation doesn’t apply.\nThe Importance of Ethics in Business, and the Harm Their Absence Can Cause\nFor businesses, ethical decision-making encourages a holistic view of operations. That includes, but is not limited to, generating value for its owners or shareholders.\nWhile there are many perspectives on the purpose of a company, leaders of some of the country’s largest firms have signed onto a statement that indicates their organizations will take more than financial value into account. The Business Roundtable, a nonprofit trade association, defined the core responsibilities of businesses as:\n- Providing value to customers in the services or products offered.\n- Investing in and supporting employees.\n- Engaging in fair and ethical trading with suppliers.\n- Supporting the communities and protecting the environments in which the company operates.\n- Creating value for shareholders.\nThe Business Roundtable said it updated its definition of the purpose of a corporation to include more than only generating financial returns, as the interests of stakeholders such as employees and local communities are deeply connected to those of shareholders.\nThe importance of business ethics is clear in this statement of purpose: These companies now recognize their responsibility to several groups and interests, even though they are not legally obligated to do so. By identifying all of the major areas where obligations to others exist and taking steps to address those commitments, these organizations take a more ethical approach than businesses exclusively focused on generating revenue.\nHow Unethical Decisions Negatively Impact Businesses\nWhile unethical decisions are not necessarily illegal, they can still cause reputational harm, boycotts by customers, increased scrutiny, and other negative outcomes. Consider these examples of activities that can be seen as unethical by some or all stakeholders:\n- Poor treatment of employees.\n- Avoidance of tax obligations through loopholes and similar means.\n- Lack of regard or care for consumers or the natural environment.\n- Irresponsible or misleading marketing.\n- Business practices that, while legal, are or appear to be unfair.\nContinuing controversies related to multinational corporation Nestle’s marketing of baby formula, as detailed by Reuters, is just one example. The business has faced calls to alter marketing of this product to mothers in developing nations dating back to the 1970s, with boycotts and other efforts raising awareness of the issue. In 2018, the company again faced criticism for inaccurate marketing descriptions of its baby formula and associated benefits.\nUnethical activities can be completely legal, or at least adhere to the letter of the law, but still attract negative attention. A company culture that recognizes the importance of ethics in business is crucial for long-term stability and success.\nBuilding an Ethical Business Culture\nA consistent ethical culture supports key business objectives, ultimately assisting an organization in its efforts to be a good corporate citizen, generate value and support its stakeholders. How can you develop an ethical business culture?\n- Clearly defining your organization’s ethical priorities supports the development of relevant and effective policies and procedures.\n- Training can educate staff as well as empower them to make ethical decisions.\n- Setting specific goals related to ethical behaviors, and making commitments to reach them, can guide efforts to operate ethically and better identify specific opportunities and concerns.\n- Compliance and review processes can help an organization ensure that its ethical concepts and commitments are practiced.\nOn the individual level, businesspeople can develop a better sense of ethics through dedicated courses as part of their educational experience.\nA Fuller Understanding of the Importance of Business Ethics\nThe advanced curriculum of a Master of Business Administration program can help you develop a firmer grasp of ethics for organizations. Our online MBA program includes two courses dedicated to business ethics:\n- Legal Environment of Business (MBA 611): This course emphasizes the impact of laws on decision-making related to management and marketing. Concepts like protecting intellectual property, avoiding antitrust traps, and addressing product liability issues are featured. Businesses and their leaders can benefit from a strong understanding of applicable laws that serve as a foundation for addressing ethical questions and taking related actions.\n- Business Ethics (MBA 650): This course goes beyond strict legal obligations to consider ethics in the modern corporate environment. How organizations respond to ethical concerns can directly influence their corporations, employees, officers, directors, shareholders, and broader community. A consistent ethical approach to business is vital for success.\nWant to earn an MBA on a flexible schedule without relocating or pausing your career? Our fully online program offers valuable student support, multiple start dates, and the flexibility to complete coursework at the time that's right for you. You can advance your career with an MBA accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, a distinction only 5% of business schools worldwide have earned.\nOur academic programs are uniquely linked to the university's Franciscan mission.

The module of claim 12, further comprising means for a receiving tube\ndisposed along the focal line and supported by support arms, wherein said\nsupport arms are connected to said form ribs and/or to an upper surface\nof said reflector.\n The present invention relates to a solar collecting module\ncharacterized by the terms in claim 1.\n Solar collectors of the above type use a parabolic shaped\nreflecting surface to collect and focus sunlight onto a focal line. The\nreflecting surface is moved along its horizontal axis to follow the\nmovement of the sun during the day.\n These solar trough collectors have proved themselves over many\nyears and are manufactured with different mirror support structures.\n Modern solar collectors are up to 100 meters long and are\napproximately 6 meters wide.\n They are driven using one or more electric motors.\n As is evident from the dimensions of these collectors and the fact\nthat they stand exposed to the weather they are subject to high wind\nforces. These wind forces place high demands on the collecting modules in\nrelation to the stability of the mirror support structures.\n These forces are especially high in relation to the twisting or\ntorsional rigidity of the structure. The reflecting and concentrating\nproperties of the collectors are adversely affected by even small\ndeformation and this affects the efficiency of the installation.\n In order to provide enough resistance to these torsional\ndeformation forces reticular tube structures are used to support the\nparabolic shaped mirrors. This uncoupling of support structure and\npre-formed reflectors results in an extremely complex overall structure.\n An example is the solar collector DE-A-198 01 078 which uses such a\nreticular tube structure to support the reflector surface. The support\nstructure is connected to a carrier tube, which provides the torsional\nrigidity. The reticular support, however, does not contribute to the\ntorsional strength, which means that these constructions are still prone\nto torsional deformation.\n Another example is the parabolic trough concentrator DE-A-197 44\n767 that likewise uses a reticular support structure.\n Diagonal tubes connected to the individual support arms provide the\ntorsional rigidity. This type of construction is suitable solely for\nshort collector modules as the torsional rigidity is not optimal.\n DE-A-199 52 276 presents a parabolic trough collector in which\nswiveling support arms are arranged on a central axis. Here also the\ntorsional rigidity originates only from the central axis tube. The arms\nthemselves do not contribute to the torsional strength.\n WO-A-02 103 256 demonstrates a parabolic solar collector which has\na central tube onto which side arms are mounted. This type of reflector\nis indeed relatively resistant to bending but has almost no torsional\n The present invention is based on the task of building a solar\ncollector, which provides torsional rigidity in a simple construction.\n This task is resolved by a solar collector module having the\nfeatures of claim 1.\n In the present invention forming ribs are surrounded by an outer\nskin layer. Together these form an enclosed box construction, which\npossesses very high torsional strength. In addition, the form ribs are\nalso parabolic shaped on their concave edge so that the reflector\nmaterial takes on the parabolic trough shape when impressed upon the\nreflector. This means that the reflecting surface material need not be\nrigid. Pre-formed parabolic mirrors, which are relatively expensive, are\nnot necessary. Instead, the material can be pliable.\n This pliable reflector material can, for example, be delivered on a\nroll and then cut to the required size on site. Transport costs are, in\nthis way, considerably reduced and the reflector surface material itself\nis also considerably cheaper than pre-formed parabolic mirrors.\n The present invention has the advantage of high torsion strength\nand that, not only pre-formed parabolic mirrors, but also pliable\nreflector material can be utilized because the parabolic trough shape is\nimpressed on the outer skin in the concave area of the form ribs.\n A further embodiment provides that the form ribs demonstrate a\nsickle shape. Because of this sickle shape the whole support structure\nwith its outer skin has, essentially the form of a supporting wing. This\nis, for example, familiar in aircraft or ship construction and possesses\nhigh rigidity in regard to bending and torsion factors.\n In order to give the form ribs the desired shape in a simple manner\nthey are manufactured using a folding or rippling process so that a\nconcave lateral edge results that is essentially parabolic shaped. At the\nsame time the edge opposite the parabolic edge can be arched.\n Onto this closed, torsion rigid support construction, formed by the\nform ribs and the outer skin the pliable reflector material is applied so\nthat it adopts the parabolic shape.\n Preferably a trapezoidal metal sheet is laid onto the outer skin,\nwhich lies on the parabolic lateral edge. This sheet has grooves running\nlengthways along the curved trough shaped collector onto which the\nreflector material is laid. This has the advantage that the supporting\nsurfaces of the reflector material, formed by the grooves in the\ntrapezoidal sheet, are free from obstructions, for example, screw or\nrivet heads and that the grooves form parallel running, strip surfaces\nwhich support the shape of the reflector material. Thereby, too,\ncompensation for materials with different heat expansion coefficients,\nfor example, glass reflector materials and metal outer skin or support\nstructure is achieved.\n The grooves of the trapezoidal metal sheet form channels that are\napt to be sealed at their lateral ends. These kind of closed channels\nhave the advantage that they can be evacuated so that, when the pliable\nreflector surface material is placed onto the support surfaces of the\ngrooves with a layer of adhesive between, the channels of the grooves can\nbe evacuated and the reflector material is held in place. This can be\ncontinued until the adhesive layer has sufficiently hardened. By this\nmeans, special clamping systems can be spared. Another possible method\nfor pressing the pliable reflector material in place is that, after\nlaying the reflector in place, the trough is closed at the lateral ends\nand filled with water. Through the water pressure the reflector material\nis pressed onto the grooves while the adhesive hardens.\n In an embodiment, the trapezoidal metal sheet is fixed, together\nwith the outer skin, to the form ribs using, for example, screws or\nrivets. In this way, a separate riveting or screwing process is avoided\nbecause the outer skin lies between the form ribs and the grooves of the\ntrapezoidal sheet and is held in place by the fastening of the\ntrapezoidal sheet to the form ribs.\n As already mentioned, it is advantageous to glue the reflector\nmaterial to the grooves of the trapezoidal sheet. In this way, small\ndeformations in the surface of the reflector material are avoided. Apart\nfrom this, different materials, as well as glass, can easily be fixed to\nthe trapezoidal sheet.\n In this way, the reflector material used in the present invention\ncan be a metal or synthetic foil or a thin glass layer with a thickness\nof, for example, 1 mm. The foil material having a reflecting upper\nsurface and the glass a reflecting surface on one or both sides.\n These thin materials have the special advantage that a second or\nmore layers can be added to them. In this way repair is considerably\nsimplified. Due to environmental effects the reflector surfaces become\ngradually ""blind"" in that the reflecting properties are adversely\naffected. They must then be either exchanged or the mirror surface\nrenewed. Whereas the present invention allows for new layers of\nreflecting material to be added.\n Along the focal line of the collector provision is made for a\nreceiving tube, which is supported by support arms. These are attached to\nthe form ribs and/or the upper surface of the reflector (16).\n This simple structure contributes to an inexpensive construction of\nthe present invention.\n Further advantages, characteristics and details of the present\ninvention are contained in the following description in which especially\npreferred embodiments are represented in detail with reference to the\n The characteristics represented in the drawings as well as those\nmentioned in the description and/or the claims can relate individually or\nin any combination to the present invention.\n The drawings show:\n FIG. 1 A perspective representation of a reflector module.\n FIG. 2 The support structure of a reflector module.\n FIG. 3 Lateral view of a form rib in the direction of arrow 111 in\n FIG. 4 A blank cutting for form ribs.\n FIG. 5a to 5c Details of production steps in the manufacture of a\n FIG. 6 An alternative drive for a reflector module installed on a\n FIG. 1 shows a reflector module (10), a plurality of which\nconstitute a solar collector plant.\n This reflector module (10) is fastened to a support structure (not\nshown) and is arranged so that the incident sun\'s rays strike the concave\narea (12) and from there are reflected onto a receiving tube (14) (see\nFIG. 3).

This is achieved by\nrippling (50) or folding. The section thus formed still has an\nessentially angular outer form that is chamfered in the next production\nstage by pressing or folding. During this production stage the lateral\nedge (48) is cut and or flanged so that, after laying the outer skin\n(22), the trapezoidal sheet (30) and the reflector material (38) onto the\nupper section (26), all have the desired parabolic shape.\n In addition recesses (52) are introduced through which pipes for\nliquids and electric power cables can run inside the reflector module\n(10). The rivets are fastened through the flanged edges.\n Altogether it can be see that the present invention comprising a\nplurality of reflector modules (10) possesses the considerable advantage\nthat each reflector module (10) has the required torsion rigidity and\nthat pliable reflector material (38) can be used onto which the parabolic\nshape is impressed by the trapezoidal sheet (30) and the form ribs (18).\nIt is therefore not necessary to use expensive pre-formed rigid mirrors.\nRelatively inexpensive foil materials can be utilized or thin glass\nmirror, which are also less expensive.\n The bonding bridges (54) connecting the upper bridges (36) and the\nlower bridges (32) balance different heat expansion coefficients between\nthe reflector material (38) and the outer skin (22) without problem. In\nthis way heat stress factors do not build up.\n In an embodiment represented in FIG. 6 the reflector modules (10)\nlie on a level base and can be swiveled by means of a suitable drive. The\nlower section (26) of the outer skin (22) is provided with a cogging,\nwhich engages, with another cogging or a pair of cogwheels mounted on the\nbase. This type of fixed reflector module (1) is even more resistant to\nbuckling than hanging modules. They are also less exposed to the wind.\n* * * * *']"	['<urn:uuid:72f7d49e-c933-4acb-adf3-ceb416639632>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	10	15	2757
45	string harmonics guitar orchestra differences techniques	In guitar, natural harmonics are found at specific fret points (12th, 7th, 5th), while artificial harmonics require touching the harmonic point with the i finger and plucking with the a finger. In orchestral strings, harmonics produce ghostly, thin tones in high registers, as demonstrated in 'Burn the Witch's climax where they create squawky, dissonant sounds when combined with ponticello bowing.	['Moreno Torroba: Sonatina, Allegretto – pizzicato\nDuring a recent class the subject how best to perform the ‘pizz’ passages in bars 21 and 22 of the opening movement (Allegretto) of Moreno Torroba’s Sonatina cropped up. If the conventional pizzicato (or muffling) technique is used there is a danger of accidentally cutting short the values of the upper chords. My own method of execution for this passage is to use a light apoyando stroke with the pad of the right hand thumb immediately rocking the hand back damping the sound with the side of the thumb. To achieve the effect several times in succession, and at the required tempo, means maintained a loose wrist. Whether this effect was suggested by the composer or was Segovia’s idea is not clear but when performed well it’s extremely effective.\nBach: Prelude (from BWV 998)\nA piece that crops up regularly in masterclasses, workshops and private lessons is the prelude from Bach’s Prelude, Fugue and Allegro (BWV 998). Of all the pieces in the guitar repertory this one seems to receive the most varied interpretations. There are numerous editions of the piece on the market and on various websites and often they differ quite considerably chiefly with regard to suggested fingering.\nWhat looks like a single voice melody above a simple bass line is in fact a much more complex multi-layered composition. With a new piece you might consider working out phrasing before planning fingerings, however there are few pieces where the fingerings dictate the phrasing and voicing more than this one. Take the first bar, for example, with no fingering suggestions there several possibilities: the majority of the upper notes could be played on the 1st string, slurs could also be used as in Segovia’s edition (Schott). Notice in Example 1, shown here, that I have suggested a form of beaming revealing two voices - foreground and background.\nLater in the piece (bars 30 - 32) there is another ‘hidden’ melody, this time it’s created by the lower of the two voices, shown here in Example 2. Of course I’m not able to say this is what Bach intended but the implied harmonies certainly suggest it.\nOn the subject of fingering: on the third beat of bar 22 the stretch required to play the upper notes can make it tricky to sustain the bass note for its full value. If a diagonal barré is used (the tip of the finger on the C sharp and base of the same finger on G) you’ll find the span is now perfectly possible. This is shown as Example 3.\nA problem I’ve encountered at courses, summer schools and even during masterclasses concerns apoyando (rest stroke) scale playing, particularly when the scale is descending. A right hand finger will come to rest against a string and then the same finger is employed for the next stroke. In other words, finger alternation is interrupted. Often the player will not be aware of the situation until it’s pointed out. A very effective exercise that will help to cure this problem is shown below.\nTry playing Example 1 repeatedly with alternating i and m fingers. As you’ll see, the exercise consists of groups of three notes played with two right hand fingers therefore each time the pattern is repeated the starting note will be played by a different finger: i the first time, m the second. Avoid the temptation to get back to the same starting finger for each group. Now try Example 2. This may prove to be a little trickier; the reason being that the notes now cross two strings, exactly as they will when playing a scale. Once this has been mastered try the same exercises with other finger combinations. I’ve found this to be very successful.\nPizzicato stridente is a term that appears at the beginning (and elsewhere) of Emilio Pujol’s Guajira from the Trios Morceaux Espanols (Eschig) - a piece I recorded several years ago. A similar effect is used in Gilbert Biberian’s Prelude no.6 ‘Pierrot’ from the set of 24 Preludes, Book 1, (Editions Orphée 43215); another piece I’ve recorded.\nStandard pizzicato (or étoufée, meaning, in French, ‘stifled’) is where the strings are damped, or muffled, by the fleshy part of the right hand below the little finger. Many pieces in the guitar repertory use this effect, Leo Brouwer’s popular Cancion de Cuna (Eschig) and Campo, the opening movement from Ponce’s Sonatina Meridional (Schott) being two examples. To achieve the pizzicato stridente effect, the action is similar but the right hand is moved a little closer to the soundhole allowing the plucked string to vibrate, or rattle, against the hand. Initially it may be difficult to judge the correct hand position but with a little trial and error it will become consistent. Unfortunately some players, both in recordings and in the concert hall, choose to ignore the direction and instead employ standard pizzicato, some play the notes staccato.\nThe performance of cross-string ornaments is a huge subject and one that crops up quite frequently. These can be executed in a number of ways. If the two notes E (1st string) and D (2nd string) are employed repeatedly (as in a trill), they are grouped in fours - but without accents. The combination of right hand fingers is very much a matter of personal taste - I favour a, i, m, p. Experiment with different patterns to see which feels most natural. When practising your chosen sequence, it’s important to begin playing slowly before building up to a suitable speed. The pattern I use can also be played as an open string arpeggio initially: a (on the first string), i (on the third string), m (on the second string) and p (on the 4th string) before transferring it to the required notes.\nMordents can also be executed in a slightly different way. If the notes D (2nd string), E (1st string), D are required, some players use fingers i and a, dragging the a finger back across the final D.\nOver-simplifying perhaps, but with each ornament the aim should be to reach the final note as quickly, clearly and as evenly as possible, leaving the final note to sustain. As ornaments are governed by factors such as period, personal opinion, note values and tempo, it is impossible to even begin covering the many examples here.\nPersonally, I avoid cross-string ornaments in renaissance lute music and Bach’s lute, violin or ‘cello works, using them only when a linear ornament is not possible. For arrangements of keyboard music: Scarlatti, Cimarosa, etc., they are ideal. Wherever they appear, care must be taken to avoid them sounding unsubtle. However, one advantage of the cross-string ornament is that it is much easier to control dynamic variation during their execution.\nThis is another subject that crops up regularly, particularly with regard to the works of Villa-Lobos. Unfortunately there is still no standard way of notating harmonics. Some composers (particularly non guitarists) tend to place a zero above or below the note-head. Others use a lozenge shaped note-head; others place ’12 har.’ - ‘7 har’, etc. above the notes required.\nThe cadential fourths and chords in harmonics in Schottish-Chôro from Suite Populaire Brésilienne (Eschig) can be tricky to fathom. Those appearing in bar 16 are simple to perform when understood. Imagine the indicated notes were to be played as natural notes rather than harmonics. I use a third finger half barré for the F sharp and B, and first finger for the following E and A. For the chords in bar 15 of the central A Major section, use a similar procedure; imagine playing natural notes initially: the first chord (from the top) consisting of G natural - 5th fret on string 4, E - 7th fret on string 5, and G sharp - 4th fret on string 6. The second chord comprises A - 7th fret on string 4, C sharp - 4th fret on string 5, and A - 5th fret on string 6. The same chords also appear in the composer’s Gavotta-Chôro (Eschig). Unfortunately it can be quite difficult to achieve clarity and uniformity of sound for each chord but moving the right hand a little closer to the bridge can help.\nAll the harmonics mentioned above are ‘natural’ - those found at certain points along an open string - 12th fret, 7th and 5th being the easiest to achieve. Harmonics at the 4th and 3rd frets are also possible, particularly on the lower tuned strings. Curiously 4th fret harmonics on each string can be duplicated at the 9th fret. Also, any harmonics found at points along the fingerboard can be recreated the other side of the 12th fret, over and beyond the soundhole. These, of course, are more difficult to locate as there are no frets to use for reference.\nNatural harmonics will provide many note pitches but unfortunately not all - the note F being one example. Artificial harmonics require a different right hand technique. Begin by playing the 12th fret harmonic E on the 1st string but with the right hand alone. This is done by touching the harmonic point with the tip of the i finger (exactly over the fret) and plucking the string with the a finger. To produce the note F, a semitone higher, stop the note with a left hand finger as usual and touch the harmonic point with the tip of the i finger at the 13th fret. You can continue chromatically along the string using a similar procedure or, of course, move onto a different string. This effect is used in many pieces in the repertoire: Miguel Llobet’s arrangement of the Catalan folk song El Testament d’Amelia and the second of Walton’s Five Bagatelles, being two examples.\nI’ve been gratified by the response to my arrangement of Lutoslawski’s ‘Twelve Folk Melodies’. I understand several prominent players are in the process of learning the set, some with a view to recording all or a selection of the pieces. I too am considering adding the work to a forthcoming solo CD. Since the arrangement was published in 2009 by PWM in Poland (Lutoslawski’s own publishing house) I have made one slight revision; this concerns the section involving harmonics in piece number 7, ‘Master Michael’, bars 21 - 24. As written, the harmonics are difficult to produce consistently. I have made the decision to locate them as shown in the following extract. The first of the two harmonics is natural, i.e. played at the 19th fret of the open 1st string. The second harmonic is played artificially - the required note A being under the already positioned 5th fret barré. In the extract the harmonics are shown at their sounding pitch.', 'Radiohead’s new release “Burn the Witch” marks the end of a long period of silence from the band. It is a patient, driving piece with an engaging form that seamlessly incorporates orchestral string instruments into the music. Often when rock songs use strings, they feel like an extra topping daubed on at the end of the process, but in this case, the strings are one of the core, integral, and defining elements of the song. And they don’t get a break: They are the first thing we hear at the beginning, they play throughout the entire song, and they are the last thing that’s left ringing in our ears at the end.\nAs an arranger myself [ed. note: and the instructor of Soundfly’s “Orchestration for Strings” course!], I often think that if an ensemble is playing throughout an entire song, the listener’s ears will get tired. Arranging moments without the orchestra can be engaging and make the moments where they are playing more striking. But that’s the wonderful thing about music — just as preconceived notions start to solidify, something comes along to smash them down. In the case of “Burn the Witch,” Jonny Greenwood (I assume he arranged the parts, given his recent orchestral work) keeps the strings engaging throughout the work in a few primo ways. Let’s take a closer look at some of the techniques he uses.\nQuick disclaimer before we move on: It should be noted that I agree with the sentiment “writing about music is like dancing about architecture,” neither are pointless, redundant, nor impossible, but both are challenging, can be unwieldy, and ultimately, nobody has any authority. I haven’t seen the scores for “Burn the Witch,” but these are some of the things I noticed when listening. Feel free to agree or disagree in the comments below!\nThe Col Legno Bowing Technique\nGreenwood explores the full technical palette of the string section and, in so doing, paints a number of exciting colors at choice moments throughout the song. The driving, frantic, percussive sound we hear at the beginning and throughout the song that sounds like a mix of arco (bowing the string) and pizzicato (plucking the string with the finger) is an effect called col legno battuto which in Italian means “hit with the wood.” It is an instruction that signals the players to turn their bows over and strike the string with the back (wooden part) of their bow. At the same time, it sounds like this percussive technique is mixed in with some members of the string section playing staccato with the horsehair side (the regular side) of the bow to pronounce the harmony.\nIn my opinion, it is the col legno effect that is the most striking element of the song’s arrangement. It’s an effect that isn’t heard that often in orchestral music, let alone pop music. It abstracts an already special treat (strings on a rock song) and hooks in listeners with a familiar yet unfamiliar sound. It turns the strings into part of the percussion section, which allows them to remain useful and engaging throughout the whole song.\nThe Legato Break\nAt around the 1:37 mark we get a striking break in texture. The band drops out, as do the percussive, col legno strings. We hear some lower members of the string section still chugging along, but the violins and violas contribute soaring, legato parts on top — closer sonically to what our ears tend to expect from a string section. The parts lilt and unfold around the vocals and seem to be mixed just as loud as — if not louder than — the vocals. This democratic move shakes off the usual sonic hierarchy we hear in pop/rock songs where the singer is the main event, followed by the guitar player, with the bass, drums, and anything else appropriately tucked under.\nThe Dissonant Harmonics\nAnother striking textural and harmonic change starts around the 3:20 mark during the sacrificial, “Wicker Man” climax. The strings start creating more of a “squawky” sound. Dissonant notes that we haven’t heard before begin jumping out of the arrangement like microwave popcorn at its tipping point. The high strings seem to be hitting harmonics — certain nodes along the fret board that when lightly touched with the finger will produce a ghostly, thin tone, higher in register than the usual note produced when the finger is fully depressed. They also seem to be playing ponticello (bowing closer to the bridge) which gives them that dry, harsh, breathy timbre in an already harsh register of the instrument.\nPlaying with Registers\nThe movement throughout the registers of the string section as well as the roles assigned to the different registers is another thing that keeps the string parts engaging. Although the strings are playing during the entire song, we experience them in (seemingly) four broad textural iterations: the col legno parts; the chunky, staccato driving pulses; the lilting, legato parts in the string break; and the high, squawky freakout harmonics at the end.\nThe col legno is generally confined to the upper-mid register of the section. This sits nicely with the rest of the band and feels like part of the percussion section. The chunky, staccato pulses are for the most part given to the lower members (cellos) and give the parts some weight and intensity when they come in on the choruses (in contrast, the contrabasses seem to be holding long, low notes underneath these moments). When the string break comes, the lilting, legato parts are again assigned to the upper-mids (now no longer playing with the wood of their bows). So while Greenwood stays in the same general register, the texture is suddenly drastically different and something we haven’t heard yet in the song.\nThe harmonics and dry, harsh playing at the end gets us into the extreme high register of the violins, which makes sense with the imagery before us. Something terrifying is coming in the video’s “Trumpton”-esque claymation, and as the string parts rise, so do the little clay flames up the Wicker Man.\nThe movement throughout the different registers prevents the listeners ears from tiring. If the violins were to play in their high range the whole time it would be exhausting, if the cellos were chugging along through the entire song we would get bored, but at a few decisive moments we get changes in texture and register that pique our ears, keep us engaged, and build a solid structure for the song to be burned alive within.\nIf you’re interested in exploring some of these techniques in more depth, here are a few of my favorite pieces that use col legno, harmonics, staccato, and the same sort of register movement as “Burn the Witch.” Do you have any you would like to contribute in the comments below?']	['<urn:uuid:dcc0981a-ee94-4312-95ec-33ba44d73acb>', '<urn:uuid:82b5af74-7e52-4ede-ad99-be53c51eaa9a>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	6	60	2925
46	What challenges exist in implementing systems science methods?	The main challenge is the need to expose and educate developmental scientists about the potential utility of systems science methodologies. This includes demonstrating concrete ways to show why and how these methodologies can help scientists explore systems-based questions about development.	['At its core, developmental science aims to explore bi-directional relationships, interactions across contexts, and change over time. Despite major statistical and methodological advances, the field is in need of new methodological tools that integrate existing and new research, at different levels of analysis, account for bi-directional feedback processes and address the complexity inherent in change that occurs throughout the lifespan. Systems science methodologies (including system dynamics, agent based modeling, and network analysis) have been successfully implemented in fields such as physics, engineering, and computer science to address such complexity. More recently, the behavioral and social sciences have begun to harness the potential of these methodological approaches in applications to questions related to public health. These systems science methodologies are particularly well suited for application to developmental science questions, yet they have not yet been harnessed to their full potential.\nThe application of systems science methods to developmental science questions holds tremendous promise. Systems science approaches integrate multiple levels of analysis—from cells to behavior to society—to understand the ways in which individual, contextual, and organizational factors interact over time. Because of its unique ability to consider simultaneously both the whole system and its individual parts, the application of systems science methodologies in developmental science shows promise for understanding complex, multidimensional issues and for transforming this knowledge into effective interventions that can fundamentally change developmental outcomes.\nThe challenge at this point is to expose developmental scientists to and educate them about the potential utility of systems science methodologies. This includes finding concrete ways to demonstrate why and how systems science methodologies can help developmental scientists explore systems-based questions about development. The RYTE Institute has engaged in several projects to this end including several publications and presentations.

47	who was protagoras main skeptic ancient times famous statement meaning	Protagoras (490-421 BC) was the main skeptic of ancient times and leader of the sophist movement. His most famous statement was 'Man is the measure of all things,' meaning that truth is relative to the individual who maintains it and there are no universal truths.	"['A brief history of Skepticism\nby Massimo Pigliucci - University of Tennessee\nSkepticism is a very ancient concept. In philosophy, it is the doctrine that absolute knowledge is not achievable. Therefore, inquiry must proceed by doubt and acquisition of approximate or relative knowledge. This is pretty much the way the modern scientific method works, even though many scientists would not consider themselves ""skeptics"" in a philosophical sense. Interestingly, one of the first modern books on the scientific method was entitled A skeptical chemist, and was authored by the father of modern chemistry, the Anglo-Irish physicist Robert Boyle (1627-1691).\nThe very first skeptics were perhaps the Greek sophists of the 5th century BC. They were philosophers of pre-Socratic time, inquiring about theology, metaphysics, natural sciences and mathematics. They specialized in dialectic and rhetoric, from which they got their bad reputation as specious thinkers. In fact, sophists believed that one should exercise his/her mind by taking different sides of the same argument and attempting to defending all with equal effectiveness. They are probably the precursors of modern lawyers...\nProtagoras (490-421 BC) was the main skeptic of ancient times. He was a Greek philosopher, leader of the sophist movement. His most famous statements is perhaps ""Man is the measure of all things"". By that he meant that truth is relative to the individual who maintains it, i.e., that there are no universal truths. He denied the possibility of objective knowledge, and went so far as to deny a difference between reason and sense. No work by Protagoras has actually reached us directly, but his ideas are presented in some of Plato\'s dialogues.\nThe first ""modern"" skeptic was David Hume (1711-1776), a Scottish philosopher. He elaborated on the philosophy of two other great thinkers: the empiricists John Locke (1632-1704), and George Berkeley (1685-1753). Let us take a quick look at these two, before going back to Hume. The English Locke opposed the existence of innate ideas, suggesting instead that the human mind is born as a blank board (tabula rasa) on which experiences inscribes the character. According to Locke, science is possible because the primary qualities of objects in the world affect human sense organs mechanically. The Irish Berkeley pushed Locke\'s ideas a step further. His subjective idealism maintains that matter does not exist independently of perception. We perceive a ""real"" world, according to Berkeley, only because of the mind of God. Hume went beyond both Locke and Berkeley, with his notion of radical skepticism. He suggested that the mind only perceives sensations, and that therefore there is no certain knowledge. A corollary was the implication that our perception of cause and effect is just that, a perception. As for religion, Hume rejected any form of theology, natural or rational.\nImmanuel Kant (1724-1804) and his agnostic doctrine is probably more close to a modern understanding of skepticism. A German philosopher, Kant openly acknowledged having being turned into a critical philosopher by reading Hume. He thought of his work as of a synthesis of Hume\'s skepticism and Leibnitz\'s rationalism (Gottfried Wilhelm, baron von Leibnitz was a German mathematician born in 1646, who died in 1716. His philosophy was quite naive, claiming that the existing world was the best of all possible worlds, a view satirized by the French philosopher Francois Marie Arouet de Voltaire (1694-1778) in his hilarious novel Candide). But let us get back to Kant. According to Kant, objective reality is known only to the extent that it conforms to the structure of our mind. He made a distinction between phenomena, which are knowable by experience, and noumena, which lie beyond experience and therefore cannot be demonstrated to exist or not exist. The main consequence - discussed in his Critique of pure reason - is that God, freedom, and similar can simply not be investigated by scientific means.\nThe first author to use skepticism as a method of inquiry was the French Rene` Descartes (1596-1650), chiefly exposed in his Discourse on method. Descartes idea was to extend the mathematical approach to discovery to every realm of human endeavor. His method therefore started out by doubting everything, and attempting to derive everything from the only thing that could not be doubted, that it doubt itself. If that is correct, then the doubter must exist, hence his famous cogito ergo sum. He then expanded gradually his inquiry, to include the existence of God as the first cause of the universe, and the existence of the physical universe itself.\nThe modern scientific method, as mentioned above, is to some degree based on skepticism. It needs to be remembered, however, that scientific positivism requires that material effect is possible only with a material cause. A spin off of skepticism is the philosophy of logical positivism, established in the 1920s by a group of thinkers known as the Vienna circle (including people like Kurt Godel, Bertrand Russell, and Ludwig Wittgenstein). Logical positivists maintain that metaphysical speculation is nonsensical, and that moral and value statement are merely emotive. Russell, in particular, suggested that individual facts are logically independent, while knowledge is dependent on data from experience.']"	['<urn:uuid:cc29a15b-e5d1-4386-aa98-bf3dba7bae02>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	10	45	847

Additionally, the area used for parking vehicles must be sloped to facilitate the movement of liquids to a drain or toward the main vehicle entry doorway.	['by Nick Gromicko and Kenton Shepard\nAn attached garage is a garage that is physically attached to a house. Fires that begin in attached garages are more likely to spread to living areas than fires that originate in detached garages. For this reason, combined with the multitude of flammable materials commonly found in garages, attached garages should be adequately sealed from living areas. A properly sealed attached garage will ideally restrict the potential spread of fire long enough to allow the occupants time to escape the home or building.\nWhy are garages (both attached and detached) fire hazards?\nThe 2006 edition of the International Residential Code (IRC) states the following concerning doors that separate garages from living areas:\nR309.1 Opening Penetration\nOpenings from a private garage directly into a room used for sleeping purposes shall not be permitted. Other openings between the garage and the residence shall be equipped with solid wood doors not less than 1-3/8” (35 mm) in thickness, solid- or honeycomb-core steel doors not less than 1-3/8” (35 mm) thick, or 20-minute fire-rated doors.\nIn addition, InterNACHI inspectors can check for the following while inspecting doors that separate garages from living areas:\nThe 2006 edition of the IRC states the following concerning garage walls and ceilings:\nR309.2 Separation Required\nThe garage shall be separated from the residence and its attic area by not less than 1/2-inch (12.7 mm) gypsum board applied to the garage side. Garages beneath habitable rooms shall be separated from all habitable rooms above by not less than 5/8-inch (15.9 mm) Type X gypsum board or equivalent. Where the separation is a floor-ceiling assembly, the structure supporting the separation shall also be protected by not less than 1/2-inch (12.7 mm) gypsum board or equivalent. Garages located less than 3 feet (914 mm) from a dwelling unit on the same lot shall be protected with not less than 1/2–inch (12.7 mm) gypsum board applied to the interior side of exterior walls that are within this area. Openings in these walls shall be regulated by Section 309.1. This provision does not apply to garage walls that are perpendicular to the adjacent dwelling unit wall.In addition, inspectors can check for the following while inspecting walls and ceilings:\nThe 2006 edition of the IRC states the following concerning ducts that penetrate garage walls and ceilings:\nR309.1.1 Duct Penetration\nDucts in the garage and ducts penetrating the walls or ceilings separating the dwelling from the garage shall be constructed of a minimum No. 26-gauge (0.48 mm) steel sheet or other approved material, and shall have no openings in the garage.Dryer exhaust ducts that penetrate garage walls are serious fire hazards. These ducts are generally made from plastic and will easily melt during a fire, creating a large breach in the firewall.\nThe 2006 edition of the IRC states the following concerning floors in garages:\nR309.3 Floor Surface\nGarage floor surfaces shall be of approved, non-combustible material.

Aircraft are categorized by approach speeds into categories A (90 knots or less), B (91-120 knots), C (121-140 knots), D (141-165 knots), and E (166+ knots). For movement types, aircraft can be heavier-than-air, which use wings or rotors for lift and move through aerodynamic principles, or lighter-than-air craft like balloons and airships that float using low density gases like helium or heated air.	"['How is aircraft category determined?\nApproach Categories (FAA)\n- Category A: Speed 90 knots or less.\n- Category B: Between 91 and 120 knots.\n- Category C: Between 121 and 140 knots.\n- Category D: Between 141 knots and 165 knots.\n- Category E: Speed 166 knots or more.\nWhat are aircraft approach categories based on?\nAn aircraft approach category is a grouping which differentiates aircraft based on the speed at which the aircraft approaches a runway for a landing.\nWhat is aircraft category?\nAccording to the FAA, an aircraft category refers to the “intended use or operating limits” of a particular group of aircraft. The classification of the aircraft refers to a group of aircraft with the same types of characteristics.\nWhat is a Category 1 aircraft?\n“ Category I ( CAT I) operation” means a precision instrument approach and landing with a decision height not lower than 200 f. Page 1. “ Category I ( CAT I) operation” means a precision instrument approach and landing with a. decision height not lower than 200 feet (60 meters) and with either a visibility of not less than.\nWhat is a Category 3 aircraft?\nCAT III A DEFINITIONS ICAO and FAA definition. A category III A approach is a precision instrument approach and landing with no decision height or a decision height lower than 100ft (30m) and a runway visual range not less than 700ft (200m).\nWhat is the difference between normal and utility category aircraft?\nNormal category aeroplanes – not intended for acrobatic operation, having up to 9 passenger seats and a maximum takeoff weight up to 5,700 kg. Utility category aeroplanes – intended for limited acrobatic operation, having up to 9 passenger seats and a maximum takeoff weight up to 5,700 kg.\nWhat is an LPV approach?\nLocaliser Performance with Vertical Guidance ( LPV ) is defined as an Approach with Vertical Guidance (APV); that is, an instrument approach based on a navigation system that is not required to meet the precision approach standards of ICAO Annex 10 but that provides both course and glidepath deviation information.\nWhat is the approach speed of a 737?\nThe proper final approach speed varies with weight, but a good target at typical operating weight is 140 KIAS. With landing gear down and flaps at 30 degrees, set the power to maintain 140. This configuration should hold airspeed with a good descent angle toward the runway.\nWhat is a Class B aircraft?\nA Class B aircraft is one that is not a Class A aircraft. A Class A aircraft is one that is certificated in the transport category or one operated under an air operator’s certificate in regular public transport operations.\nWhat is type rating cost?\nType rating costs can be high at around $20000 and more. Type rating is a must when one plans to fly aircrafts that weigh in excess of 5600 kgs mean take-off weight and for turbojet powered aircrafts and for multi engine jet aircraft. You have to pass an oral exam and flight test along with practical test standards.\nWhat is a Class 2 aircraft?\nClass II airplanes, which typically are multiple reciprocating engine, multiple turbine engine and single turbine engine airplanes under 6,000 pounds. Class IV airplanes, which typically are commuter category airplanes. All weights are based on maximum certificated gross takeoff weight.\nWhat are the weight classes of aircraft?\nThere are 6 categories — (A) Heavy, (B) B757, (C) Large Jet, (D) Large Commuter, (E) Medium, (F) Small.\nWhat is an SA CAT 1 approach?\nAuthorization CAT I ( SA CAT I) (to a RA DH as low as 150 ft and visibility as low as RVR 1400) and Special Authorization CAT II ( SA CAT II) (formerly known as CAT II on Type I – CAT II to runways with at least a MALSR but without touchdown zone (TDZ) and/or runway centerline lights (RCL)).\nWhat is VREF?\nThe regulations define Vref as “the speed of the airplane, in a specified landing configuration, at the point where it descends through the 50-foot height in the determination of the landing distance.” You may have heard pilots refer to this point in the landing approach as when the airplane is “crossing the fence” or\nWhat is VSO speed?\n1.3 Vso is 1.3 times the stalling speed, or the minimum steady flight speed, in the landing configuration with flaps down, engine at low or idle power as it would be just prior to touchdown.', 'Categories and classificationEdit\nAircraft fall into two broad categories:\nHeavier than airEdit\n- Heavier than air aerodynes, including autogyros, helicopters and variants, and conventional fixed-wing aircraft: aeroplanes in Commonwealth English (excluding Canada), airplanes in North American English. Fixed-wing aircraft generally use an internal-combustion engine in the form of a piston engine (with a propeller) or a turbine engine (jet or turboprop), to provide thrust that moves the craft forward through the air. The movement of air over the airfoil produces lift that causes the aircraft to fly. Exceptions are gliders which have no engines and gain their thrust, initially, from winches or tugs and then from gravity and thermal currents. For a glider to maintain its forward speed it must descend in relation to the air (but not necessarily in relation to the ground). Helicopters and autogyros use a spinning rotor (a rotary wing) to provide lift; helicopters also use the rotor to provide thrust. The abbreviation VTOL is applied to aircraft other than helicopters that can take off or land vertically. STOL stands for Short Take Off and Landing.\nLighter than airEdit\n- Lighter than air aerostats: hot air balloons and airships. Aerostats use buoyancy to float in the air in much the same manner as ships float on the water. In particular, these aircraft use a relatively low density gas such as helium, hydrogen or heated air, to displace the air around the craft. The distinction between a balloon and an airship is that an airship has some means of controlling both its forward motion and steering itself, while balloons are carried along with the wind.\nTypes of aircraftEdit\n- See also: List of aircraft\nThere are several ways to classify aircraft. Below, we describe classifications by design, propulsion and usage.\nA first division by design among aircraft is between lighter-than-air, aerostat, and heavier-than-air aircraft, aerodyne.\nExamples of lighter-than-air aircraft include non-steerable balloons, such as hot air balloons and gas balloons, and airships (sometimes called dirigible balloons) such as blimps (that have non-rigid construction) and rigid airships that have a rigid frame. The most successful type of rigid airship was the Zeppelin, although there were some accidents such as the Hindenburg Zeppelin which was destroyed in a fire at Lakehurst, NJ, in 1937.\nIn heavier-than-air aircraft, there are two ways to produce lift: aerodynamic lift and engine lift. In the case of aerodynamic lift, the aircraft is kept in the air by wings or rotors (see aerodynamics). With engine lift, the aircraft defeats gravity by use of vertical thrust greater than its weight.\nAmong aerodynamically lifted aircraft, most fall in the category of fixed-wing aircraft, where horizontal airfoils produce lift, by profiting from airflow patterns determined by Bernoulli\'s equation and, to some extent, the Coanda effect.\nThe forerunner of these type of aircraft is the kite. Kites depend upon the tension between the cord which anchors it to the ground and the force of the wind currents. Much aerodynamic work was done with kites until test planes, wind tunnels and now computer modelling programs became available.\nIn a ""conventional"" configuration, the lift surfaces are placed in front of a control surface or tailplane. The other configuration is the canard where small horizontal control surfaces are placed forward of the wings, near the nose of the aircraft. Canards are becoming more common as supersonic aerodynamics grows more mature and because the forward surface contributes lift during straight-and-level flight.\nThe number of lift surfaces varied in the pre-1950 period, as biplanes (two wings) and triplanes (three wings) were numerous in the early days of aviation. Subsequently most planes are monoplanes. This is principally an improvement in structures and not aerodynamics.\nOther possibilities include the delta-wing, where lift and horizontal control surfaces are often combined, and the flying wing, where there is no separate vertical control surface (e.g. the B-2 Spirit).\nThe lifting body configuration is where the body itself produce lift. So far the only significant practical application of the lifting body is in the Space Shuttle, but many aircraft generate lift from nothing other than wings alone.\nA second category of aerodynamically lifted aircraft are the rotary-wing aircraft. Here, the lift is provided by rotating aerofoils or rotors. The best-known examples are the helicopter, the autogyro and the tiltrotor aircraft (such as the V-22 Osprey). Some craft have reaction-powered rotors with gas jets at the tips but most have one or more lift rotors powered from engine-driven shafts.\nA further category might encompass the wing-in-ground-effect types, for example the Russian ekranoplan also nicknamed the ""Caspian Sea Monster"" and hovercraft; most of the latter employing a skirt and achieving limited ground or water clearance to reduce friction and achieve speeds above those achieved by boats of similar weight.\nA recent innovation is a completely new class of aircraft, the fan wing. This uses a fixed wing with a forced airflow produced by cylindrical fans mounted above. It is (2005) in development in the United Kingdom.\nAnd finally the flapping-wing ornithopter is a category of its own. These designs may have potential but are not yet practical.\nSome types of aircraft, such as the balloon or glider, do not have any propulsion. Balloons drift with the wind, though normally the pilot can control the altitude either by heating the air or by releasing ballast, giving some directional control (since the wind direction changes with altitude). For gliders, takeoff takes place from a high location, or the aircraft is pulled into the air by a ground-based winch or vehicle, or towed aloft by a powered ""tug"" aircraft. Airships combine a balloon\'s buoyancy with some kind of propulsion, usually propeller driven.\nUntil World War II, the internal combustion piston engine was virtually the only type of propulsion used for powered aircraft. (See also: Aircraft engine.) The piston engine is still used in the majority of aircraft produced, since it is efficient at the lower altitudes used by small aircraft, but the radial engine (with the cylinders arranged in a circle around the crankshaft) has largely given way to the horizontally-opposed engine (with the cylinders lined up on two sides of the crankshaft). Water cooled V engines, as used in automobiles, were common in high speed aircraft, until they were replaced by jet and turbine power. Piston engines typically operate using avgas or regular gasoline, though some new ones are being designed to operate on diesel or jet fuel. Piston engines normally become less efficient above 7,000-8,000 ft (2100–2400 m) above sea level because there is less oxygen available for combustion; to solve that problem, some piston engines have mechanically powered compressors (blowers) or turbine-powered turbochargers or turbonormalizers that compress the air before feeding it into the engine; these piston engines can often operate efficiently at 20,000 ft (6100 m) above sea level or higher, altitudes that require the use of supplemental oxygen or cabin pressurisation. During the forties and especially following the 1973 energy crisis, development work was done on propellers with swept tips or even scimitar-shaped blades for use in high-speed commercial and military transports.\nPressurised aircraft, however, are more likely to use the turbine engine, since it is naturally efficient at higher altitudes and can operate above 40,000 ft. Helicopters also typically use turbine engines. In addition to turbine engines like the turboprop and turbojet, other types of high-altitude, high-performance engines have included the ramjet and the pulse jet. Rocket planes have occasionally been experimented with. They are restricted to rather specialised niches, such as spaceflight, where no oxygen is available for combustion (rockets carry their own oxygen).\nThe major distinction in aircraft usage is between military aviation, which includes all uses of airplane for military purposes (such as combat, patrolling, search and rescue, reconnaissance, transport, and training), and civil aviation, which includes all uses of airplanes for non-military purposes.\nCombat planes like fighters or bombers represent only a minority of the category. Many civil aircraft have been produced in separate models for military use, such as the civil Douglas DC-3 airliner, which became the military C-47/C-53/R4D transport in the U.S. military and the Dakota in Britain and the Commonwealth. Even the little fabric-covered two-seater Piper J3 Cub had a military version, the L-4 liaison, observation and trainer aircraft. In the past, gliders and balloons have also been used as military aircraft; for example, balloons were used for observation during the American Civil War and World War I, and cargo gliders were used during World War II to land intruding German troops in many European countries in the 1940/42 period, while Allied troops used them in Europe after D-Day .\nCombat aircraft themselves, though used a handful of times for reconnaissance and surveillance during the Italo-Turkish War, did not come into widespread use until the Balkan War when first air-dropped bomb was invented and widely used by Bulgarian air force against Turkey. During World War I many types of aircraft were adapted for attacking the ground or enemy vehicles/ships/guns/aircraft, and the first airplanes designed as bombers were born. In order to prevent the enemy from bombing, fighter aircraft were developed to intercept and shoot down enemy aircraft. Tankers were developed after World War II to refuel planes in mid-air, thus increasing their operational range. By the time of the Vietnam War, helicopters had come into widespread military use, especially for transporting and supporting ground troups.\nhelicopter]] Civil aviation includes both scheduled airline flights and general aviation, a catch-all covering other kinds of private and commercial use. The vast majority of flights flown around the world each day belong to the general aviation category, ranging from recreational balloon flying to civilian flight training to business trips to firefighting to medevac flights to cargo transportation on freight aircraft.\nWithin general aviation, the major distinction is between private flights (where the pilot is not paid for time or expenses) and commercial flights (where the pilot is paid by a customer or employer). Private pilots use aircraft primarily for personal travel, business travel, or recreation. Usually these private pilots own their own aircraft and take out loans from banks or specialized lenders to purchase them. Commercial general aviation pilots use aircraft for a wide range of tasks, such as flight training, pipeline surveying, passenger and freight transport, policing, crop dusting, and medical transport (medevac). Piston-powered propeller airplanes (single-engine or twin-engine) are especially common for both private and commercial general aviation, but even private pilots occasionally own and operate helicopters like the Bell JetRanger or turboprops like the Beechcraft King Air. Business jets are typically flown by commercial pilots, although there is a new generation of small jets arriving soon for private pilots.\nSee also Edit\n- Aerial refueling\n- Aircraft carrier\n- Aircraft spotting\n- Airline call signs\n- Air safety\n- First flying machine\n- Flight controls\n- Flight instruments\n- Lifting body\n- List of early flying machines\n- Model aircraft\n- Mobile phones on aircraft\n- Spacecraft propulsion\n- Steam aircraft\n- Successful aircraft types\n- Wright brothers\n- List of aviation, aerospace and aeronautical terms\n- Smithsonian Air and Space Museum - Excellent online collection with a particular focus on history of aircraft and spacecraft\n- Virtual Museum\n- Prehistory of Powered Flight\n- The Evolution of Modern Aircraft (NASA)\n- Check-Six - Information on historic aircraft crashes including the X-15 and Flying Wing\n- Aircraft community\n- HomebuiltAircraft.com- Information Portal about Homebuilt Aircraft\n- Series of Photo Essays on British Aviation\n- Pictures of Aircrafts published on Usenet\n- PAF Procedures and Information, Wallpapers, Picture Gallery, Updated News\n- US 821393 -- Flying machine—O. & W.

50	im doing research what challenges do camera operators face when filming documentaries in difficult situations like war zones	Documentary cinematographers face several formidable challenges in such situations. They must deal with immediate technical challenges like framing and focusing, while also confronting ethical dilemmas. These include being unable to provide material assistance to people in desperate need, having the privilege to leave conflict zones while subjects cannot, and potentially impacting subjects' safety or reputation through their work. They also must manage complex power dynamics, as their presence can shift the balance of power in conflicts. Additionally, they often cannot control how their footage will be used or distributed in the future.	['Ticket Information: Free and Open to the Public\ncourtesy of Janus Films:\nA boxing match in Brooklyn; life in postwar Bosnia and Herzegovina; the daily routine of a Nigerian midwife; an intimate family moment at home: these scenes and others are woven into Cameraperson, a tapestry of footage captured over the twenty-five-year career of documentary cinematographer Kirsten Johnson. Through a series of episodic juxtapositions, Johnson explores the relationships between image makers and their subjects, the tension between the objectivity and intervention of the camera, and the complex interaction of unfiltered reality and crafted narrative. A work that combines documentary, autobiography, and ethical inquiry, Cameraperson is both a moving glimpse into one filmmaker’s personal journey and a thoughtful examination of what it means to train a camera on the world.\ncourtesy of press kit:\nThe joys of being a documentary cameraperson are endless and obvious: I get to share profound intimacy with the people I film, pursue remarkable stories, be at the center of events as they unfold, travel, collaborate, and see my work engage with the world. I experience physical freedom and the chance for artistic expression and discovery every time I hold a camera. No wonder I’ve been doing it for twenty-five years and love my life.\nAnd yet, the dilemmas I face while holding my camera are formidable. There are the concrete challenges I must meet in the moment—how to frame, find focus, choose what direction to follow. The other troubles are implicit, and often unseen by audiences:\n• The people I film are in immediate and often desperate need, but I can offer them little to no material assistance.\n• I can and will leave a place I film—whether a war or a refugee camp—while the people I film cannot.\n• I traffic in hope without the ability to know what will happen in the future.\n• I ask for trust, cooperation, and permission without knowing where the filming experience will lead the subject.\n• I shift the balance of power by my very presence, and act on behalf of one side or another in a conflict.\n• My work requires trust, intimacy, and total attention. It often feels like a friendship or family—both to myself and the people I film—but it is something different.\n• I know little about how the images I shoot will be used in the future, and cannot control their distribution or use.\n• My work can change the way my subject is perceived by the people who surround him or her and can impact the subject’s reputation or safety for years into the future.\n• I follow stories the director I work for does not need and/or does not want me to follow.\n• I fail to see or follow stories the director hopes I will follow.\nI’ve been aware of these dimensions for most of my career, as is the case for most documentarians, and I have often discussed them with colleagues. What I didn’t know until recently was how much the accumulation of these dilemmas would begin to affect me.\nAnd what I didn’t anticipate when this film began just five years ago was how many people in the world would be using their cell phones as cameras, communicating instantaneously, and seeing images from every part of the globe. Surveillance, political repression, censorship, and the possibility of worldwide distribution of images filmed by any individual on the planet have an effect on all of us and our relation to filming in shifting and unprecedented ways.\nIn making Cameraperson, my team and I decided to rely as much as possible on the evidence of my experience that is contained within the footage I shot. We know this fragmentary portrait is incomplete and are interested in the way it reveals how stories are constructed. Our hope is to convey the feeling of immediacy that comes with finding oneself in new territory with a camera, as well as to give the audience a sense of how the joys and dilemmas a cameraperson must juggle accumulate over time.\nLike the film, this note is an invitation to you, and an acknowledgment of how complex it is to film and be filmed.\nPhoto: Getty Images\ncourtesy of press kit:\nKirsten Johnson (director/producer/cinematographer) has worked as a documentary cinematographer and director, and has committed herself to recording human-rights issues and fostering visual creativity. She has been the principal cinematographer on more than forty feature-length documentaries, and she has been credited on numerous others.\nAfter graduating from Brown University in 1987 with a degree in fine arts and literature, Johnson traveled to Senegal to study with acclaimed filmmakers Djibril Diop Mambéty and Ousmane Sembène. The experience inspired her to apply to La Fémis, France’s national film school, where she studied cinematography.\nFollowing her graduation from La Fémis, Johnson served as cameraperson on a number of highly acclaimed and award-winning documentaries, including Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004), This Film Is Not Yet Rated (2006), Pray the Devil Back to Hell (2008), and The Invisible War (2012).\nJohnson has had a long-standing collaboration with Oscar-winning filmmaker Laura Poitras; she was the cinematographer on The Oath (2010) and Citizenfour (2014) and shot the upcoming film Risk. Additionally, she shot footage that appeared in Poitras’s visual-arts exhibition on surveillance, Laura Poitras: Astro Noise, which opened at the Whitney Museum in the winter of 2016.\nWhen not filming, Johnson teaches a graduate course in visual thinking at NYU’s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute and a course on cinematography at the School of Visual Arts, and, working with the Arab Fund for Arts and Culture, she often leads workshops for young camerapeople and documentarians in countries such as Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia.\nPhoto: Samira Bouaou/The Epoch Times\nLinksHere is a curated selection of links shared on our Facebook page for additional insight/information:\n9/15/17 – “Cameraperson testifies to a world in which it would be clear to see that we’re all connected, if only we took the time to look at one another with reverence and simply listen.” Ann Hornaday, Washington Post – link\n9/21/17 – “No film has more eloquently revealed the provisional, flawed, hopeful, expansive, manipulative, righteous human endeavour called documentary filmmaking.

51	led lights foxlights protect livestock cost effectiveness	LED lights and Foxlights are effective at protecting livestock while being cost-effective. Studies in southern Kenya showed LED lighting systems reduced predator attacks on livestock by almost threefold and reduced livestock kills by over four times compared to before installation. Foxlights specifically use solar-powered sensors that randomly flash LED lights visible up to half mile away and have been successfully used globally to protect livestock from various predators including wolves and snow leopards. Both are considered nonlethal methods that are more cost-effective than lethal control, offering long-term 24/7 protection without ongoing costs.

(2018), 15, 1-1\nA simple predator exclosure applied to saffron-cowled blackbird nests resulted in 69% fledging success compared to 36% for the controls.\nRestoring lowland heath through small-scale turf removal at Cooper’s Hill Nature Reserve, Bedfordshire\nHitchcock G.E. (2018), 15, 2-4\nAt Cooper’s Hill Nature Reserve, Bedfordshire, England, areas of mature heather Calluna vulgaris have been lost and replaced by dense grassy swards. We hypothesised that any heather seedlings would have difficulty competing with the grasses and tested this by removing the turf to expose the nutrient-poor sandy soil in seven small plots across the reserve. These plots, together with control areas, were monitored annually to determine which vegetation types would re-establish. Five plots also received seed-rich brash (cut heather) on half of each plot to determine whether additional seeding of stripped areas was required. Analysis of the data collected over the first five years indicates that the technique increased the amount of heather seedlings establishing, as measured by percentage heather cover. Adding seed rich brash had no effect, implying a good amount of viable heather seed is present in the soil at this site. Grasses are also establishing in the stripped areas but are not dominating the plots.\nThe use of bud caps (leading shoot tree guards) to relieve browsing pressure in remote areas of Caledonian pinewood at Mar Lodge Estate National Nature Reserve, UK\nPainting A.I., Agnew J. & Rao S.

(2018), 15, 6-11\nEndangered species in heavily modified landscapes may be vulnerable to extinction if no conservation plan is implemented. The Suweon treefrog Dryophytes suweonensis is an endemic endangered species from the Korean Peninsula. In an attempt to conserve the species, a translocation plan was implemented in the city of Suwon. The receptor site was a specially modified island in a reservoir. Egg clutches were collected from four nearby sites, and were hatched and reared in a laboratory during 2015. One hundred and fifty froglets were released at the new site. In 2016, one year after the translocation, calling male D. suweonensis and newly hatched tadpoles and juveniles were recorded. Juveniles were seen until the last week before hibernation in autumn 2016. However, only a single male was recorded calling in 2017. The population was consequently considered functionally extinct. Failure of the translocation most likely arose from mismanagement of the vegetation surrounding the wetlands, and the resulting inability of the site to fulfil the ecological requirements of the species. The project allowed the development of rearing protocols for the species, and defined its ecological requirements.\nTesting tools for eradicating the invasive toad Duttaphrynus melanostictus in Madagascar\nReardon J.T., Kraus F., Moore M., Rabenantenaina L., Rabinivo A., Rakotoarisoa N.H. & Randrianasolo H.H. (2018), 15, 12-19\nIn 2014, the Asian toad Duttaphrynus melanostictus was first recorded as an invasive species in Madagascar. A feasibility study identified an urgent need to test eradication tools. This study attempts to refine estimates of the toad population and test four potential eradication tools: 1) pitfall trapping and drift fencing, 2) hand-capture removal, 3) citric acid sprays, and 4) tadpole trapping. Using delimited searches and removal trials we estimate that the Asian toad population exceeds seven million post-metamorphic toads within the incursion. Pitfall trapping and drift fencing appeared to function well as control strategies, considering the challenges of operating in a rural working environment. Capture rates suggested that, at the spacing used, a minimum of 14 nights of trapping was needed to see a strong decline in capture rates. Hand-capture of toads demonstrated the potential of local labour to deplete a free ranging toad population, but also showed that the duration of effort would need to be extended as capture rates did not decline strongly over time. Citric acid spray trials showed that this topical toxicant can be very effective for toad control, especially for juveniles. Phytotoxicity trials suggest crop and vegetation damage was not prohibitive to its broader use. Tadpole traps did not work, but we are uncertain of the influence of tadpole developmental stages on this result. This study suggests that an eradication strategy may be possible and should be tested in carefully ordered trials within a delimited area. However, the prospects of employing the best methods over the entire incursion area is likely to be cost-prohibitive and extremely high risk.\nThe effect of using ‘displacement’ to encourage the movement of water voles Arvicola amphibius in lowland England\nGelling M., Harrington A.L., Dean M., Haddy E.C., Marshall C.E. & Macdonald D.W. (2018), 15, 20-25\nWater voles are nationally protected as one of Britain’s most endangered wild mammals. However conflict can arise where works are required along short sections of riverbank. Vegetation removal is commonly used with the aim of displacing water voles towards safety prior to development, despite a lack of evidence demonstrating its efficacy. This study aimed to investigate the movement and fate of water voles in response to vegetation removal, by radio-tracking individuals during spring and autumn at 12 experimental and four control sites. Vegetation was removed to ground level from 50 m of riverbank at experimental sites, and observed home ranges were compared before and after vegetation removal. There was no significant net movement of water voles out of areas where vegetation had been removed in either spring or autumn, although movement of individuals both in and out of the works area did occur. There was no impact of treatment on water vole survival in either season.\nUncleaned crop seed sowing as a tool to conserve Bromus grossus and restore species-rich arable-dependent plant communities\nPiqueray J., Gilliaux V., Gaillard T., Mahy G. & Delescaille L.M. (2018), 15, 26-31\nSegetal plants, which grow preferentially or exclusively in cereal fields, experienced a strong decline during the last century. Among them, Bromus grossus received particular attention, as it is highly threatened in Europe. Its decline is thought to be due to crop seed cleaning among other causes. Re-establishing the sowing of uncleaned crop seeds should therefore be considered as a tool for the conservation of this species. In this study, we aimed to evaluate (i) how the conservation of B. grossus relies on transfer in uncleaned crop seed, (ii) how this practice may help to restore new populations of this species, and (iii) the contribution of this practice to the dispersal of other segetal plants. From 2012 to 2016, we monitored eight fields from three farms in Southern Belgium where uncleaned spelt seed containing B. grossus was sown. We found that B. grossus grew in the year following seed sowing, but disappeared in the second year in most cases. This highlights the extreme dependence of B. grossus upon uncleaned spelt-seed sowing. We also showed that, through associated management practices, B. grossus acted as an ‘umbrella species’ to other arable-dependent plants. Transfer of uncleaned seed led to an increase in species richness in an experimental field from 12 species in 2015 to 43 species in 2017. Based on the germination of uncleaned seeds in a greenhouse, we concluded that it was likely to account for the dispersal of at least nine species, and possibly 15 others.\nMechanical and manual control of prickly pear Opuntia dillenii in lakeside dunes at Laguna del Portil, southern Spain\nGarcía-de-Lomas J., Martín I., Saavedra C., Fernández-Carrillo L., Martínez E. & Rodríguez C. (2018), 15, 32-36\nWe present the results of an intervention to control prickly pear Opuntia dillenii in an area of coastal dunes with Juniperus spp. and Pinus pinea at the ‘Laguna del Portil’ Site of Community Importance, Huelva, southern Spain, in 2015-2017. In the first stage, a total of 2,266 m³ (approximately 460 MT) of the cactus was removed using heavy machinery, which was supplemented by the manual removal of 4 MT of fragments. Subsequently, as part of the periodic control and monitoring work, a total of 200 and 126 kg of shoots and saplings were removed manually after 15 and 25 months respectively. Twenty-six months after the mechanical removal, the composition of native plant species in treated and reference plots (uninvaded areas that represent well-preserved native vegetation) provided evidence of natural recovery. The economic efficiency of the different control stages was compared. The results suggest that combining mechanical and manual methods, adapted to the abundance, size and distribution of the invasive plant, was an effective approach. Additionally, subsequent annual rounds of control appear to be sufficient to provide effective ongoing control of the invasion of Opuntia dillenii.\nTreatment of adult Valcheta frogs Pleurodema somuncurense for chytrid fungus\nArellano M.L., Velasco M.A., Martínez Aguirre T., Zarini O., Belasen A.M., James T.Y. & Kacoliris F.P. (2018), 15, 37-37\nTreatment of an ex-situ colony of Valcheta frog with chloramphenicol solution was not successful in eliminating chytrid fungus.\nManagement strategy to avoid chytrid fungus infection in egg clutches of the Valcheta frog Pleurodema somuncurense\nArellano M.L., Velasco M.A., Martínez Aguirre T., Zarini O., Belasen A.M., James T.Y. & Kacoliris F.P. (2018), 15, 38-38\nEggs which were removed from a chytrid-infected population of Valcheta frogs shortly after laying and then hatched in a clean environment resulted in juveniles free of the fungus.\nEffectiveness of LED lights on bomas in protecting livestock from predation in southern Kenya\nOkemwa B., Gichuki N., Virani M., Kanya J., Kinyamario J. & Santangeli A. (2018), 15, 39-42\nVarious interventions have been employed to mitigate livestock predation by lions and other carnivores. Livestock owners have typically employed lethal and/or non-lethal measures with varied successes and failures. Resolving the human-carnivore conflict is key to the survival of carnivores and ensuring local livelihoods and safety. Here we assess the effectiveness of placing LED lighting systems at bomas (livestock enclosures) in order to deter predator attacks at night in two group ranches surrounding Amboseli National Park, southern Kenya. Both the number of predatory attacks and the number of livestock killed were significantly lower after the LED lighting system was installed, compared to the period before the LED system was installed for the same boma, or compared to control bomas without LEDs. LED lights reduced the number of attacks on livestock in bomas by almost threefold, and reduced the number of livestock killed by over four times compared to the levels recorded before the LED lights were installed. The results provide clear evidence that the LED system, as installed at bomas in the study regions, was an effective means of reducing night-time predation on livestock, at least in the short term (six months) during which effectiveness was monitored.\nEvaluation of the effectiveness of 3D-printed corals to attract coral reef fish at Tamarindo Reef, Culebra, Puerto Rico\nPérez-Pagán B.S. & Mercado-Molina A.E. (2018), 15, 43-47\nThe development of artificial corals using 3D-printing technology has been proposed as an alternative to aid the recovery of fish populations in degraded reefs. However, no study has empirically evaluated the potential of such artificial corals to attract fish to reef patches. We conducted an experiment to determine whether the number of fish associated with natural and 3D-printed corals differs significantly. The 3D-printed artificial corals mimicked the morphology of staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis, whose branches serve as habitat for many fish species. There is evidence indicating that fish abundance increases with habitat complexity, but no specific evidence relating to A. cervicornis. Therefore, we also investigated whether the structural complexity of both natural and artificial corals affected their effectiveness to attract fish. We found that the number of fish associated with artificial and natural corals was not significantly different. However, irrespective of coral type, fish were more abundant in corals with the highest levels of complexity. Our findings suggest that 3D-printed corals can serve as a complementary tool to improve the ecosystem function of degraded coral reefs.\nNative plant recovery after the mechanical removal of invasive Agave spp. in coastal habitat in Almería, southeast Spain\nGarcía-de-Lomas J., Schwarzer H., Sanz F.J. & Fernández-Carrillo L. (2018), 15, 48-49\nOne year after mechanical removal of invasive Agave spp. in coastal sandy habitats in southeast Spain, the native plant composition showed partial recovery. However, the subsequent proliferation of Agave rhizome offshoots will require periodic rounds of manual, selective control.\nEfficacy of a mitigation method to reduce raptor electrocution at an electricity distribution line in Mongolia\nDixon A., Bold B., Tsolmonjav P., Galtbalt B. & Batbayar N. (2018), 15, 50-53\nWe conducted a trial of a mitigation technique aimed at reducing avian electrocution rates at a 15kV electricity distribution line in the Mongolian steppe. Electrocution resulted from birds contacting live conductor cables either when perched at the top of the grounded steel-reinforced concrete pole or when perched on the steel crossarm. Mitigation focused on line poles and involved creating a barrier between the live conductors and perch sites at randomly selected poles. This involved attaching the pin insulator at the top of the pole with a new mount, so that it was repositioned centrally to discourage birds from perching on top of the pole, while additional unconnected pin insulators were affixed adjacent to those supporting the conductor cables on the crossarm to provide a barrier to birds touching the live cables. Electrocution rates were significantly lower at mitigated poles compared to control poles, with an average reduction of 85%. This mitigation technique is relatively inexpensive to implement (approximately US$12/pole for materials), with no additional maintenance requirement and a life expectancy similar to that of the base pole design. While not eliminating electrocution risk, this mitigation technique may be useful in circumstances where the cost of implementation and sustained maintenance largely determines whether or not any form of mitigation is undertaken.\nUse of grazing and mowing to reduce the dominance of soft rush Juncus effusus in fen meadows in Scotland\nShellswell C.H. & Humpidge R. (2018), 15, 54-58\nThree years of differing management regimes to reduce the dominance of soft rush Juncus effusus were undertaken at Moss Town Fen on the north-east Aberdeenshire coast, Scotland, UK. The effectiveness of grazing and mowing combinations of increasing intensity were trialled, from ungrazed and unmown management to continuous grazing and annual mowing for three years. Sward height and density, and rush cover were surveyed to examine the effect of the management combinations. Forb, grass, bryophyte and bare ground cover were also monitored to understand whether the management treatments had any effect on these sward components. Continuous grazing with konik ponies and at least two years of mowing (either consecutively or with a gap year) reduced rush the most. The treatments had no consistent effect on forb, grass or bryophyte cover, which may be due to a time lag between the reduction in rush cover and the germination and growth of these sward components. Bare ground cover was low, at less than 1% in most of the treatments, negating any concern that the grazing intensity was having a negative impact on the delicate fen habitat. Anecdotal observations on waterfowl and lesser butterfly orchid Platanthera bifolia support the benefits of a grazing and mowing regime to reduce rush dominance. These results also identified that a cost saving could be made by slightly reducing the intensity of management regime.', 'Nonlethal Solutions to Reduce Conflicts\nHELPING LIVESTOCK AND PREDATOR TO COEXIST\nLivestock losses are an unfortunate reality of ranching. Most losses are disease or weather related or result from birthing complications; predators can also kill livestock, but good animal husbandry practices combined with strategic nonlethal predator control methods can considerably reduce such losses. Ranchers can choose which methods will work best for their livestock operation. Although many nonlethal techniques exist for reducing livestock losses to predation, the specific technique(s) employed will depend on the type and size of livestock operation, habitat/terrain, native predator species present, cost, and available resources.\nLethal or Nonlethal?\n– The Cost of Lethal Methods\n– The Value of Nonlethal Methods\n– What Killed my Livestock?\nFencing & Fladry/Turbo Fladry\nLivestock Guardian Animals (LGAs)\nNight Corrals & Shed Lambing\nScare Tactics & Foxlights\nAnimal Husbandry & Shepherding\nLETHAL OR NONLETHAL?\nThe best livestock protection strategy is to have effective nonlethal systems in place and to use lethal control only as a last resort with chronic depredation and when non-lethal methods have proven ineffective.\nTHE COST OF LETHAL METHODS\n- Reactive — generally used after livestock is killed\n- Rarely target offending animal\n- Disrupt predator social structures, which can lead to increased conflicts with livestock\n- Can lead to an increase in rodent/rabbit populations\n- Often inhumane, causing pain and suffering\n- Labor intensive — requires ongoing killing as predator populations rebound\n- Snares, poisons and body-gripping traps can injure or kill non target animals, including pets and livestock\n- Can negatively impact ecosystems\nTHE VALUE OF NONLETHAL METHODS\n- Proactive — prevent losses before they occur\n- More humane\n- Offer long term cost effectiveness\n- Less harmful to ecosystems\n- Allow predators to control rodent/rabbit populations\n- Depending on types used, can provide long term 24/7 protection\n- Often more cost-effective\nWHAT KILLED MY LIVESTOCK?\nWhen finding a carcass that has been fed upon, identify whether the animal was killed or was simply scavenged after death. Bleeding can only occur before or shortly after death, so look for blood at the area of suspected attack and around the carcass site. Bites on live animals will cause bruising under the skin. In heavily wooled sheep it may be necessary to shave or skin the head and neck to check for punctures or bruises. Signs of a struggle, drag marks, broken and bloody vegetation and a nervous flock are also evidence of predation. Lack of these signs suggests a scavenged carcass. Domestic dogs often severely mutilate their victims and rarely feed on carcasses.\nFencing is a rancher’s first and best defense. But predators can penetrate a fence by digging under, jumping between wires, crawling through holes, or jumping over.\nAbsolute predator-proof fencing, although possible, is generally cost prohibitive; however, woven wire fencing in good repair will deter many predators from entering pastures, especially if vertical stays are no more than 6 in. apart and horizontal wires are spaced 2 to 4 inches apart at the bottom. Although more expensive than high-tensile electric fences, woven wire has many advantages and should be considered for perimeter fences. High-tensile electric fencing is another option. Perimeter fences should consist of at least five strands of high-tensile smooth wire. Increasing the number of wires will improve effectiveness and wires need to be properly spaced (bottom wires must be closer than top wires). Where there is adequate soil moisture, all wires should be electrified. Otherwise, the fence should have a mixture of both live and ground wires. A good height for keeping sheep in and predators out is 48 inches. Fence lines must be kept clear of vegetation. Weeds and grass that touch the fence will reduce voltage and effectiveness of the shock.\nFladry is a line of rope mounted along a fence line with hanging strips of red nylon flags. The flags frighten predators, making them unwilling to cross the line. Fladry lines were traditionally carried by wolf hunters in Eastern Europe to drive wolves to areas where they could then be killed. Studies show that fladry can deter wolves for several months. While fladry also deters coyotes, they generally cross flags sooner than wolves. Turbo fladry is fladry with hot wire added. Turbo fladry can remain effective up to twice as long as regular fladry.\nLIVESTOCK GUARDIAN ANIMALS (LGAs)\nWhen obtained from responsible breeders and trained and used correctly, LGAs can significantly reduce losses from predators. Whether you choose dogs, llamas or donkeys consider these tips:\n- Use a reputable breeder who sells animals specifically for guardian work. Most llama and donkey breeders offer 30-day trials. Dog breeders should be willing to answer questions during the training process.\n- Not all LGAs will work. Some may ignore or even attack livestock. Never leave LGAs alone with livestock until they have bonded.\n“I like to say that my dogs are professionals. My sheep are the entire focus of their lives…they’ll defend the sheep till their death if they have to.”Marcia Barinaga\n- Popular guardian breeds include Great Pyrenees, Anatolian Shepherds, Maremma, and Akbash\n- Unusual to find trained dogs for sale and pups take a year or more of training before they are ready to work\n- Can guard poultry, sheep, and cattle\n- Can work with other guardian dogs\n- Secure fencing may be required to prevent some dogs from wandering\n- May be aggressive to and may bark at people or pets who enter pasture\n- Require dog food instead of hay or forage\n- Usually more expensive than llamas and donkeys\n- Short lived compared with other guardian animals\n- Spaying and neutering makes dogs more reliable guardians\nLLAMAS, ALPACAS & DONKEYS\n- Similar feed requirements as sheep\n- Easy to fence in\n- Generally calm temperaments\n- Less effective in hilly terrain\n- Don’t roam or bark\n- Less prone to accidental death than dogs\n- Long working life\n- No training required\n- Can guard sheep, goats, cattle, poultry\n- Generally bond to livestock that can be wary of dogs\n- May not be effective against larger predators\n- May not protect well if used with others of their kind\nFlerds are cattle and sheep grazing together to form a herd. Cattle offer some protection to sheep but pen bonding is required to ensure sheep bond with cattle. Bonding is accomplished by penning sheep with cattle for a couple of weeks. A creep feeder should be available so lambs can escape if necessary. Once you have some trained sheep, others can be added to flerd without requiring pen bonding.\nSince most predators attack at night, putting animals in smaller, predator-proof corrals provides greater protection from attack. Keep the corrals well lit and clear of brush. Feeding grain in the corrals initially will make sheep easier to gather. Many predators hunt at dusk and dawn so be sure livestock is in corrals before dusk and let out after dawn.\nLambing inside a barn can prevent many losses from predators and also makes it easier to spot birthing problems and sick or injured animals who might be overlooked in pastures.\nPredators — especially coyotes — are wary of new things in their environment, so scare tactics can be very effective. Change and rotate these deterrents to reduce habituation.\nThey are especially useful when added to other nonlethal methods during critical times like lambing.\n- Park vehicles in different or unusual spots\n- Use an outdoor radio on a dusk-to-dawn timer set to a talk radio station\n- Hang outdoor Halloween decorations that move and make noise, either randomly or by motion sensor. If motion activated, be sure the sensor is far from livestock so they don’t constantly trigger the device.\nFoxlights deter nighttime attacks by mimicking the appearance of a person patrolling pastures with a flashlight. Their dusk-to-dawn solar-powered sensors randomly flash LED lights at 360 degrees and can be seen up to a half mile away. Foxlights have been used successfully around the globe to protect livestock and crops from a variety of species including snow leopards, wolves, elephants, foxes and coyotes. Foxlights attach easily to existing fencing and are best placed where livestock bed down at night.\nHUSBANDRY PRACTICES & SHEPHERDING\nSimple husbandry practice reduce livestock losses. Some important protocols include:\n- Maintain human presence; range riding and being on the land and around livestock are effective ways to keep predators at bay\n- Remove carcasses and sick animals from your ranch as soon as possible\n- Keep carcass pits well away from livestock\n- Prevent livestock from grazing in areas with dense cover where they can be easily ambushed\nChickens are vulnerable to attack from many animals including raccoons, rats, skunks, owls, bobcats and dogs. Take steps to protect them. Effective predator-proofing is essential. Chickens should be brought into safe coops every night well before dusk.\n- Use a LGA in areas with high predator loads\n- Cover any opening in the coop or outdoor run with ¼ inch hardware cloth\n- Bury the hardware cloth 12 inches into the ground around outdoor runs to prevent predators from digging underneath\n- Cover the runs to prevent attacks from raptors\n- Secure door and window latches to prevent raccoons from accessing the coop\nNON-LETHAL METHODS (Misc.)\nDefenders of Wildlife.

52	What safety training happens during Ski & Sail expeditions?	During these expeditions, participants train in handling critical maritime situations like man-overboard, fire, abandoning vessel, dismasting and grounding. For skiing, the first day includes training in search and rescue techniques and avalanche equipment use. Everyone is trained to be an active crew member rather than just a passenger.	"[""mai 24 - 29. mai 2022\nWelcome to one of our most exclusive trips so far. When the skiing season is about to end in mainland Norway, it’s at it’s best in the arctic archipelago of Svalbard! The sun is back and shining 24 hours a day, animals are back and thriving and the snow-conditions are perfect, so May’s a fantastic time in Svalbard.\nSvalbard can offer fjords, mountains and vast wilderness areas that are still untouched by human activity even now in our time. The traces we find in the nature here are not from people, but from the polar fox, seals, birds, reindeer or the queen of these lands, the polar bear! On this trip we’ll be accompanied by the wild animals and the elements; air, ocean and ice in every way - from sea ice, to glaciers and snow we can ski in all forms.\nWith 6 days at hand we have time to get to know the Isfjord. And if the weather forecast allows us we have the alternative of navigating out of the Isfjord basin and up along the north-west coast of the island Spitsbergen to the really majestic fjords. How far we sail each day to ski will of course be due to weather and snow-conditions along the way.\nWe will experience and explore raw nature, ski-tour and get tired and pumped, and eat and drink well. We use the dinghy to shore, put on our skis and skins at the beach, hike up and ski down a mountainside probably nobody have skied before us. Everything is set for an awesome trip!\nThe ski touring we do during this week will be planned with everyone the day before. After a day’s hike and ski we relax in the boat with warm and good food, before we sail to the next fjord, harbour or anchorage.\nWith us onboard on this trip we bring a certified ski-guide with several years of experience with this type of ski-touring in Svalbard.\nThis trip starts and ends in Longyearbyen, the main city of Svalbard. See the day-to-day program for more information.\nOn our trips we travel as sustainable as possible, we will use our sails as much as possible without using engine, and we try to not leave any lasting traces at sea or land. In SailNorway we are engaged in taking care of the environment as much as we can and we think that smaller sailing boats with fewer people and little pollution and waste, are way less harmful to the environment, the climate and local wildlife, compared to bigger vessels and cruise ships. We do also try to clean up plastic in the places we visit instead of leaving any trash. At Svalbard we follow AECOs regulations for encountering with wildlife, beach cleaning, cultural heritage sites and for visitors and tourist operators in the Arctic. You can read more about AECO’s guidelines here.\nEpic. Epic. Epic. As a skier and a outdoors-man it is impossible not to dream of Svalbard. There is also a very special light and skiing opportunities long into the summer.\nDay 1: Ship o’hoi - let’s meet and set sails!\nWelcome on board! We will meet in Longyearbyen harbour at 10:00, get settled in to the boat and get to know each other. Before we set sails, we’ll take you through safety routines on board, and familiarize you with the boat. We eat dinner on our way out of the fjord and we will try to get a ski hike during the day.\nDay 2: Skitouring in outer Isfjorden\nThe most famous and visited fjord in Svalbard is Isfjorden. In their respective side fjords in this fjord system, lies the cities of Longyearbyen, Barentsburg and Pyramiden as well as smaller abandoned places. The fjord is surrounded by great mountains for skiing, so before we sail north, we go for a hike or two around Isfjorden.\nDay 3 - 4: Isfjorden, Kongsfjorden (Kings Bay), Krossfjorden\nThese days we use in the Isfjord, and if the weather forecast allows us we will explore the magnificent fjords on the north-west coast of the Spitsbergen island. With ski touring and sailing, nice meals and spectacular wilderness!\nDay 5: Sailing back home towards Longyearbyen\nWe start thinking about the return, whether it'll be from the Isfjord or the southwards travel back home and stop for a skitour along the way if we see that there's time for it. We aim for a visit in Barentsburg and finish the day with dinner in Longyearbyen this last night!\nDay 6: Thanks for a great trip!\nAfter breakfast we clean ourselves out of the boat and we wish each other a good travel back home. Thanks for a great trip in these beautiful surroundings! If you have the time, we recommend spending an extra day or two in Longyearbyen to relax after the week’s impressions and get to know more of this little multicultural Arctic hub.\nThe program may change according to weather and conditions, but it gives an indication of how we spend the days. We start every day with a good breakfast and make a packed lunch before we go ashore. Some of the days we eat dinner right away after skiing, other days we just eat a little when we come back to the boat, and then sail on before we make a later dinner. Some days, we spend time fishing, and time to look around. If the weather should be really not in favour of skiing, then we spend the day sailing or do something else fun.\nTravel - in general\nSometimes we have to fly, but not always. If you have the luxury of time, we always encourage to travel as environmentally friendly as possible. Traveling slowly also gives another start to a holiday. Cycling, taking the train or driving a car together are good alternatives! Feel free to add some extra time before and after, since up in the north weather that can sometimes change your plans.\nVery few row to Svalbard, a few more sail, but most fly. Norwegian and SAS fly to Longyearbyen, check out www.norwegian.no or www.sas.no.\nWhat exactly is Ski & Sail?\nSki & Sail is a trip concept where we sail into the foothills of the mountains and start the ski trip by the edge of the water. By boat we can move from place to place, and choose mountain sides and areas based on weather and conditions. Ski & Sail is something Italian and French skiers have done in Norway since the 90s, and something Norwegians so far have only started to discovered the joys of. SailNorway has arranged Ski & Sail trips on Helgeland, in Steigen, in the Lofoten Islands, in Lyngen, Finnmark and on Svalbard for many years, and we dare say that we know many of the very best places along the coast. Skiing & Sailing is really cool!\nLevel of this trip - medium level\nOn this trip we require some experience with randonee/alpine touring/backcountry skiing. If you have a lot of experience it is great, and you will get to work on your skills and techniques. Those with a lot of experience often ski steeper slopes than the others, and may take on several runs during one day. But we try to keep the level as even as possible, so we can choose the destination from the participants' level. If you are in doubt as to whether this is the trip for you, please feel free to contact us, and we can look at the level of the other participants and find a trip that suits you perfectly - whether you are a beginner or experienced.\nSafety and risk - in general\nSailing wise, our trips are not difficult, and you are always welcome to join us! We have with us both people who have never sailed before and experienced sailors. However, you must be prepared for everything from no wind to sailing in harsh weather. If you are a beginner, we will try to make you a seaman/woman as soon as possible. If you are experienced you will be given responsibility and greater challenges. We take safety seriously and on our trips we train on handling different situations that can occur at sea. Man-over-board, fire, abandon vessel, dismasting and grounding are some of these. Building the participants' skills on how to handle critical situations are important elements for better safety on board. On board a boat and on trips, everyone must know what to do in potentially dangerous situations. For us it is important that you as a guest and participant is trained quickly enough to be a participant not a passenger. It contributes to learning, sense of achievement and increased safety for all. It's also why our trips are considered to be sailing courses, you are trained to be one of the crewmembers on board.\nWe have the same mindset when it comes to skiing and alpine/backcountry trips. The first day of skiing we train and repeat search and rescue techniques, and the use of avalanche equipment. Many elements determine the safety of an alpine/backcountry trip. Good planning, humbleness in relation to weather and avalanche risk, and a dynamic group are important.\nMountain hikes and alpine/backcountry trips involves a certain risk, as does sailing. However, we as an operator, and our skippers and ski guides, do everything we can to minimize the risk in a professional manner. Everyone gains on this and we have no one to lose. Feel free to contact us to discuss risk.\nIf we are in a place without snow, we sail to where the snow is! With the sailboat we are flexible with regards to finding the best snow, but that means we may go somewhere that is not mentioned in the program or a place that we have not tested in advance. Then it's extra exciting.\nOrdinary alpine/backcountry equipment is required for this trip, that means avalanche-/ski backpack with beacon, probe and shovel, and alpine/backcountry skis with skins and ski crampons. We have a few backpacks/sets that can be hired through us and ski equipment can be rented through our partners. In good time before departure we will send you a detailed recommended packing list for this trip.\nFood and cooking\nOn our trips everyone contributes to the operation of the boat, so as long as you have not booked one of our trips with a designated chef, all take their turns in the galley during the trip. Skippers and guides assist as much as they can along the way. In advance of the trip, we set up a menu and shop what is needed. We offer good menus with healthy and medium-advanced food. If you have allergies or preferences let us know in the registration form, and we take that into account.\nWhat we expect from you\nWe want you to take part in the routines onboard the sailboat, whether it is sailing, docking, navigating, looking for whales and icebergs, washing up, cooking, clean the boat or contribute in other ways when required. Our trips require a little work of the participants - and you must be open to contribute and open up a bit socially. We have many different people with us on our trips, and most people go very well together. Our experience is that doing things with others out in nature, and not least do things with new people with different personalities than one might be used to, is what creates the best, most interesting and memorable stories :)\nLife on board and accommodation\nLife on board a sailboat is social and pleasant, but for some it can be perceived as quite intimate and crowded, which is important to be prepared for. On our trips everyone participates in the operation of the sailboat and everyone is considered crew. We would like to get to know you well and hope that you will get to know everyone else on the sailboat as soon as possible. It requires some patience, generosity and an open mind to thrive, but the new acquaintances and completely raw nature experiences are quickly what will take your focus as soon as you become comfortable with life at sea.\nAccommodation on the boat is part of the fun. The accommodation is generally in shared cabins, some of which have a double bed and some have a bunk bed solution. The distribution is quite a puzzle, but we do believe we are quite good at it. Let us know if you have any special needs or reservations.Any accommodation before and after the trip must be arranged on its own. If you have any doubts about where to stay, we’re happy to give you some recommendations.\nOn the boat we have a lot of heat and a lot of good food, but not always abundance of fresh water.\nWhat kind of people join this trip?\nMany come alone, some travel as couples, some travel as a group of friends. The common denominator for everyone is that these are fun and committed people you become friends with almost no matter what. Sharing grand experiences creates strong ties! Many people wonder about the age composition of our trips, but that is not so important to us. It doesn't matter if you are young or old as long as you want to go on a trip and intend to do your part so that you and the rest of the crew will have a good trip together.\nEnvironment and sustainability\nBoth sailing and alpine/backcountry trips are environmentally friendly activities and we sail as much as we can and use the engine as little as possible. We encourage crew and participants to travel as environmentally-friendly as possible, and we use local ingredients and resources as far as possible. We also have our own trips where we collect litter and clean ocean trash from beaches.\nPhilosophically we often say that sailing is an exercise in sustainability; we move with the wind and we have limitations on things like water, diesel, electricity and food. In order to run sustainable - knowledge, patience, agility and hard work are required. The same can be said about many other things that one tries to do in a sustainable way.\nChanges to the program\nThe program should be seen as a starting point that we adapt to weather and conditions. We also reserve the right to constantly improve our itineraries. Onboard with us we always have a dinghy for beach landings and small expeditions, we have fishing gear for the cod, and gear to hike or make a bonfires on the beach - we are ready for adventure!

53	kitchen knife maintenance storage rules	Proper knife maintenance involves both sharpening and storage. For sharpening, avoid waiting until the knife is completely dull - sharpen it when it starts losing effectiveness, using methods like whetstones, manual or electric sharpeners. For storage, there are several safe options: magnetic knife blocks (though these may affect blade alignment), non-magnetic knife blocks with slots, wall-mounted magnetic strips, or individual knife sayas (protective sheaths). Never store sharp knives loose in drawers with other utensils as this can damage both the knife and other items. Additionally, keep knives clean and dry, washing them after use particularly when handling raw meats to prevent cross-contamination.	['Table of Contents Hide\nJapanese knives are among the best globally but are useless if not sharp enough. A blunt blade will consume much of your effort and time to make it sharp. That’s why most chefs around the world sharpen their Japanese knives while still sharp. It becomes easy and fast.\nWhether you are a budding or professional chef, you wouldn’t want your knife to be blunt. It will alter the original flavors of the fresh ingredients you cut.

Do the sharpening yourself.\nWhether you are sharpening it or having hired an expert, the knife will sharpen using various methods. All knife sharpening methods are ideal at home and commercial places.\nSome chefs usually sharpen their knives when still very sharp. Avoid it because sharpening involves removing some pieces of metal used in making the blade’s edge. If you sharpen unnecessarily, you remove those metal pieces unnecessarily, making your knife wear out quickly.\nBut this doesn’t mean that you’ll have to wait for your knife to be blunt to sharpen it. As stated above, it will make the process hard and take much of your time. Regarding this, you may wonder the best time to sharpen a Japanese knife? Here is the answer;\nThe Best Time to Sharpen a Japanese Knife\nWhen you notice that your knife has started becoming dull in its operations, it’s time to have its edge sharpened. It involves the removal of some amounts of metal using a sharpener. Knife sharpeners come in various categories as follows;\nKnife Sharpeners used to Sharpen Japanese Knives\nI. An Electric Knife Sharpener\nMost chefs love using electric knife sharpeners because they are easy to use. Since the sharpeners are electric, the abrasives rest on motorized wheels, which turn against the blade. Most manufacturers offer user instructions to avoid mistakes.\nAfter putting on the sharpener, hold your knife to the abrasive lightly, but secure enough not to avoid the knife falling off. The machine comes with various slots for sharpening. Place your knife’s blade in the ideal space, smoothly and slowly. Then allow the device to do its work.\nThis method is ideal for less valuable Japanese knives. Sharpen your precious knives from Japan with a whetstone (will be discussed hereinbelow). A wrong move with an electric knife sharpener can ruin your priced and valued knife.\nElectric knife sharpers get recommended because of the following benefits;\nAdvantages of an Electric Knife Sharpener\n- The machines contain several grinding slots with different blade coarseness to prevent over-sharpening.\n- The first slot comes aggressive to repair extensive damage quickly.\n- Thanks to the spring-loaded guides that restrict the knife from moving to allow a steady contact of its blade with the abrasive, the sharpening process is easy.\nWith the above benefits, it doesn’t mean that electric sharpeners do not have some shortcomings. They include the following;\nDisadvantages of Electric Knife Sharpeners\n- You will need to dig deeper into your pockets to own one\n- If your knife has a full bolster, sharpening it with an electric machine is impossible.\nII. Manual Knife Sharpeners\nUnlike the electric sharpeners, these devices consist of non-motorized wheels or a V-shaped chamber for the abrasive material. While sharpening your knife, you need to pull the blade through the section using consistent pressure. If unsure of how to sharpen your knife, check the instructions manual that comes with the machine.\nManual knife sharpeners have won the hearts of many chefs globally. Are you wondering why? Here is the insight;\nAdvantages of Manual Knife Sharpeners\n- Most users can afford them\n- The machines come with tall walls responsible for keeping the knife steady while the user draws it through the sharpening chamber using constant pressure\n- The devices consist of thin bodies, making them easy to store in a kitchen drawer for convenient use.\n- Sharpens various commercial kitchen knives excellently and fast\n- Perfectly sharpens full bolster knives\nThe machines seem perfect but come with the following drawback;\nDisadvantages of Manual Knife Sharpeners\n- The sharpener cannot repair a severely damaged blade, such as removing notches\nLike their name, they are devices that look like stone and come designed to sharpen knives. You can buy one from a store next to you. Using a whetstone requires practice and a set procedure. Here is how to use one;\nHow to Sharpen Your Japanese Knife Using a Whetstone\nStep 1: Place the Stone Securely on a Countertop\nThe first thing to do is to set the whetstone securely. If your whetstone does not come with a unique stand for holding it firm while sharpening your knife, place a damp paper towel or rubberized shelf liner under it.\nStep 2: Start Sharpening One of the Knife’s Sides\nTurn the knife’s blade away from you and place it on the whetstone. Hold the knife’s handle with one hand and its middle part with your other hand. Ensure your fingers stay flat. Also, avoid the knife’s sharp edge. Then start pushing the blade down and in a circular motion.\nMaintain holding the exact angle of the blade until the knife’s tip runs off to the other side. Keep on doing it until the knife’s dullness disappears.\nStep 3: Confirm the First Side’s Sharpness\nAfter several rounds of gliding the knife’s blade against the whetstone, check whether it has gotten sharpened enough. Test by running your thumb perpendicularly to your knife’s blade edge. If you feel the burr from the knife’s handle to its tip, that side’s sharpness is okay.\nStep 4: Sharpen the Other Side\nSwitch your knife to the other direction and start sharpening using the same process. Repeat several times until the sharpness is as intended.\nStep 5: Turn the Whetstone on Fine Side and Repeat the Sharpening of Both Sides\nA whetstone consists of a fine and rough side. The above sharpening process begins with the coarse side. After sharpening, turn the whetstone to the fine side and repeat the sharpening procedure until both sides get optimally sharpened.\nLike other sharpening methods, whetstones come with several benefits. Here is what you’ll enjoy when you sharpen your knife using a whetstone;\nAdvantages of Whetstones\n- The sharpeners come at pocket-friendly prices\n- You will enjoy the device’s services for many years\n- It adapts excellently as the user holds the knife at an angle that matches the blade\n- Whetstone sharpens knives with full bolster\n- It contains a fine and coarse side for regulating the sharpness\nAs someone not familiar with using a whetstone, you may not like the following;\nDisadvantages of a Whetstone\n- Restoring a dull blade may take long\n- Using this device requires practice, which might take time to master\nFor optimal results, you need to soak your whetstone while sharpening your knife. But avoid over-soaking as it will reduce the whetstone’s quality. Always dry the sharpening stone with a dry, clean towel (read our article on how to clean a Japanese knife.) after using it. Then place it in an airy place to dry. It is advisable to store it while wrapped in a towel to guarantee dryness and prevent it from getting molds.\nAs explained above, sharpening a Japanese knife can be done in many ways. But whatever method you choose, you need to consider some things for safety and maximum results. The following are things to note when sharpening a Japanese knife;\nEssential Things to Put in Mind While Sharpening a Japanese Knife\n- You may need to touch the blade directly to test the degree of sharpness. It would help if you were careful because the sharp edge can cut you.\n- Avoid sharpening the blade’s edge so thinly. As a result, the cutting edge may develop nicks that make it lose its sharpness.\n- While sharpening the knife, handle it with care as the blade keeps on getting thinner as you sharpen it.\nAfter spending time sharpening your knife, you may wonder if you’ve done an incredible job. To know whether your knife is sharp, you can carry out the following tests;\nHow To Check a Sharp Knife\n1) Paper Test\nIt’s a straightforward procedure. You only need to use your knife’s blade to shave thin paper strips. If your knife is sharp, it will cut through the paper smoothly and very fast. A blunt knife may get caught as you cut the paper and leave jagged edges. While carrying out this test, both the paper and knife shouldn’t be wet or damp for optimal results.\n2) Food Method\nUsing food is the best method to test your knife’s sharpness. You can cut or slice vegetables like onions, tomatoes, and scallion. If the blade cuts precise slices quickly without squashing the food item, then its sharpness is okay.\nIf you find yourself exerting more pressure to cut the vegetable, and it seems squashed or damaged, it means that your knife is dull or blunt.\n3) Nail Test\nTake your knife and gently place its blade on one of your fingernails. Do not apply pressure but use the knife’s weight to press into the nail. If the edge digs a little into your nail, your knife is sharp. If it slips across your nail, the blade is blunt or dull.\nNow that your Japanese knife is well-sharpened and ready for the task, you need to be careful how you store it. Keeping the sharp blade with other cutlery and small kitchen tools is not a wise decision. The knife’s sharp edge may damage other things stored together. You may also cut yourself if stored poorly or in a place you can’t spot it.\nThe sharp knives may also become dull fast when they slid against other metal items. To avoid all these problems, here is how you should store your sharp knife.\nHow to Store a Sharp Japanese Knife\ni. Magnetic Knife Blocks\nThey are accessories designed to store sharp knives. The blocks contain magnets that help stick the knives safely onto the board. But according to experts, the magnetic blocks and racks may make the knives’ molecular level misalign.\nii. Non-Magnetic Knife Blocks\nThe blocks are the opposite of the magnetic ones discussed above. Instead of having magnets to stick the knives, the block comes with slots for storing the blades. Consider the size and design of your knife before buying one. Some knives may not fit in these blocks. The best option is to buy a universal knife block with slots of various sizes.\niii. Wall-Mounted Magnetic Blade Strips\nIt comes as a strip incorporated with magnets. You only need to mount it on your kitchen wall then place the sharp knives on them. Because of the attraction, the blades will stick securely, freeing up your kitchen drawer. If you have many knives to store, consider a long strip.\niv. Knife Saya\nA knife Saya is a protective sheath made for storing blades. It is an individual cover that keeps the knife safe and looking better. The polypropylene material used in making the Saya makes it safe to store with other cutlery and kitchen tools.\nAs illustrated above, it is essential to use a sharp knife. It will help you prepare a delicious meal fast and ensure your foodstuffs’ taste and texture remain intact. Because of their many uses, Japanese knives usually go dull or blunt.\nFortunately, there are various ways of sharpening a dull knife, as discussed above. Please do not allow your knife to become extremely blunt to sharpen it. You will use more time and energy to bring it back to its functional state. To avoid that, sharpen your knives often.\nAvoid keeping sharp knives with other kitchen tools, as explained above. They may chip or become damaged. Cutlery or small metal items may suffer from scratches or dents from the sharp blade. Use the storing methods explained above to store knives. Also, consider the discussed tips when sharpening your Japanese knife.', 'Cooking can be a relaxing and enjoyable pastime. Unfortunately, the kitchen is also the most common room in the home where accidents occur. These kitchen safety tips will help keep you and others safe while you’re cooking and eating.\nHot pots and appliances, boiling water, splattering grease and oil, sharp knives; all these things are common in a kitchen. They can also be the things that make working in a kitchen a dangerous place. Keeping your kitchen clean to avoid contaminating the food is also important.\nFirst of all, make sure that your kitchen is clean from top to bottom, inside and out, this will prevent cross-contamination of dirt, bacteria and germs.\n- Get in the habit of washing your hands before handling foods and after handling raw meat.\n- Keep raw meat in a separate area of your refrigerator. Keep it tightly wrapped or place it in a leak proof container so juices can’t contaminate other foods.\n- Wash the counter top or cutting board with hot, soapy water after you’ve finished handling raw meat.\n- It’s best to use separate cutting boards, one for raw meats and another for vegetables. Tip: color code your cutting boards or use a plastic one for meat and a wooden one for other foods, this way you won’t forget which to use.\nMeats should be cooked to recommended internal temperatures as determined by the United States Dietary Association:\n- Steaks and Roasts – 145 degrees F\n- Egg dishes – 160 degrees F\n- Fish – 145 degrees F\n- Chicken breasts – 165 degrees F\n- Pork – 160 degrees F\n- Whole poultry – 165 degrees F\n- Ground beef – 160 degrees F\nTo keep food fresh longer, keep your refrigerator temperature set below 41 degrees F and your freezer should be kept at 0 degrees F. Date each item before it is placed in your freezer so that you can use it before it gets too old.\nThaw frozen foods in the refrigerator overnight, in the microwave oven, or submerged in a bowl of cold water. Place the package in a watertight plastic bag, submerge in cold water, then change the water every 30 minutes until item is thawed. Don’t just leave the meat on the counter or in the sink to thaw as bacteria in the food can multiply and cause someone to get sick.\n- Teach your child which items might be hot and not to touch them with out your permission.\n- Invest in good quality, heat resistant pot holders and oven mitts. Don’t use a tea towel or dish cloth for this purpose, especially damp ones as the moisture can create a steam burn.\n- Keep pot handles turned so they are over the stove or counter top so someone walking by can’t accidentally knock them and their hot contents over.\n- Cover pans that contain hot grease or oil with a lid or splatter screen.\n- Keep your knives sharp, believe it or not cuts happen less often and are less damaging with sharp knives.\n- Always cut away from yourself, never toward yourself.\n- Always use a cutting board, don’t place the food in your hand to cut it.\n- Don’t leave knives in the sink, especially in dish water where they can’t be seen.\n- Store knives point down in a butcher’s block or in some other special holder. This keeps them sharp longer and prevents cuts.\nLast but not least, if you sample food as you cook use a clean spoon or fork each time. Taste testing just once can transfer germs from your mouth to the food.\nCooking can be hazardous, but it certainly doesn’t have to be. Simply follow the precautions mentioned above, then you will be cooking with confidence and the knowledge that you’re doing it in a safe, healthy manner.']	['<urn:uuid:818762e6-934d-41f3-b48e-93fddc9da959>', '<urn:uuid:3519d386-58fb-4789-b3ad-fbac75fd4a7c>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	5	102	2819
54	adhd brain differences dopamine genetic factors statistics	ADHD has a genetic and neurobiological basis, with brain scans showing 34% smaller frontal lobes, temporal grey matter, caudate nucleus and cerebellum. The brain has lower dopamine levels, and 25% of close relatives of ADHD children have similar disorders compared to 5% in general population. Those with ADHD have higher densities of dopamine transporters, causing low synaptic dopamine levels.

Actually, it was first described in 1845 by a psychiatrist in a boy called â€œfidgety Philipâ€. Today, the worldwide incidence is 3-5 per cent, irrespective of nationality. In referral paediatric clinics, it is as high as 15.5 per cent. The average age at diagnosis is eight years with a 6:1 male-to-female ratio.\nChildren who have the hyperactive impulsive type of ADHD are unbearably fidgety, restless and impatient, always running, jumping, climbing and blurting out inappropriate comments. They often receive corporal punishment from frustrated parents and teachers. Others, with the inattentive type of ADHD, are dreamy and bored, with difficulty in paying attention, learning something new or completing a task. Homework becomes a particular problem, with assignments forgotten, books misplaced and the final unsatisfactorily completed task full of erasures and errors.\nAround 40 per cent of children with ADHD (especially boys) are argumentative, defiant, stubborn, non-compliant and belligerent. They lie, steal, fight, bully others, have temper tantrums and engage in vandalism. Eventually, as teenagers, they may gravitate towards drugs and alcohol.\nTo make a diagnosis of ADHD:\n* The symptoms should have set in before the age of seven years and have lasted for at least six months\n* They should cause difficulties in the childâ€™s life, in school, at play, at home, in the community and in social settings\n* The changes should not have been precipitated by a sudden traumatic event like the death of a parent\n* There should be no diagnosed medical ailments like seizures, middle ear infections or a learning disability to explain the symptoms.\nSociety often finds fault with the parents of children with ADHD. They are criticised for faulty nurturing and lack of parental discipline. But parents are actually helpless, as ADHD has a genetic and neurobiologic basis. Scans have shown that the frontal lobes, temporal grey matter, caudate nucleus and cerebellum of the brains of these children are 34 per cent smaller than normal in volume. Also, the brain has lower levels of a signal-processing chemical called dopamine.\nThe exact reason for these changes is not known. However,\n* ADHD runs in families. About 25 per cent of the close relatives of ADHD children also have similar disorders as opposed to 5 per cent in the general population\n* Women who smoke and drink during pregnancy have a higher incidence of children with ADHD\n* High blood lead levels have been demonstrated in some children with ADHD. This, however, is not a consistent finding\n* A sugar high has been blamed for some of the symptoms. This is a label for the increased level of activity following the ingestion of highly refined sugars or carbohydrates, which enter the bloodstream rapidly and produce fluctuations in blood glucose levels. This is particularly true if (as in the case of cola drinks) the food also contains caffeine (a stimulant) and food additives. Diet restrictions reducing the quantities of such food help in some cases.\nChildren with ADHD hate change in any form. They need a scheduled, regimented life with the same routine every day. All their belongings should also be organised and kept in specific places. With structured care, these children show a great deal of improvement and are able to integrate into society. About 30 to 70 per cent of children with ADHD continue to have symptoms in adult life. Academic excellence â€” a prelude to higher studies and a good job â€” may remain elusive. This is aggravated by poor social skills. They remain easily distracted, hyperactive and impulsive and have difficulty with deadlines, prioritisation and social engagements. Decision-making is an almost insurmountable hurdle. They also have problems holding down a steady job. Many are able to function on computers and are intelligent enough to do programming and other jobs which do not require social interaction. Around 80 per cent need to continue to live with parents or siblings.\nSome children do not improve despite psychotherapy and a structured environment. They require medication with mental stimulants like methylphenidate and atmoxetine. They do well if they take their medication, which may need to be continued into adult life.\nCompetition is fierce in India, for education, jobs, promotions and success. Reservations and capitation fees are a way of life. In this scenario, parents may find it difficult to cope with a hyperactive, inattentive, disobedient and impulsive child who does not conform to social norms.\nIt is often difficult for the parents to accept that their child has ADHD. They feel depressed and guilty, even though it is not their fault. And despite all folklore to the contrary, an arranged marriage to an unsuspecting spouse does not cure the problem.\nSource:The Telegraph (Kolkata, India)', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental health disorder. It causes a pattern of hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and inattentiveness. The person may not listen to others, and it has nothing to do with a defiance problem or not being able to comprehend.\nSome individuals with ADHD have the hyperactivity aspect while others only have the inattentive aspect. In some cases, the person has both attention problems and hyperactivity. Mayo Clinic states the exact cause of ADHD isn’t known. Research indicates the development of the nervous system, the person’s environment, and genetics may play role in the onset of ADHD.\nPeople with ADHD may experience the following symptoms:\n- Difficulties with listening\n- Failure to finish chores, schoolwork, or other duties\n- Inability to deal with details\n- Making careless mistakes\n- Trouble with organization\n- Difficulty paying attention during lectures, lengthy readings, or conversations\n- Inability to follow instructions\n- Difficulty sequencing events\n- Poor time management\n- Inability to complete tacks\n- Difficulties with maintaining focus\n- Dislike of tasks that require mental effort\n- Memory issues\n- Losing items repeatedly\n- Being easily distracted\n- Constant talking\n- Running, dashing, or climbing in inappropriate situations\n- Inability to play quietly\n- Interrupting others\n- Trouble waiting in line\n- Difficulty expressing thoughts clearly\nHow Common Is ADHD?\nADHD is most prevalent in children. It affects about 9 percent of children and adolescents between the ages of 3 and 17, which is equivalent to nearly 5 million children. The American Academy of Pediatrics states that in a classroom of 30, about 2-3 children may have ADHD. Boys appear to have the condition more than girls, and it affects black children and kids of multiple races at a higher rate.\nChildren don’t always outgrow ADHD. Some people have it throughout their adulthood. In fact, about 33-50 percent of individuals diagnosed with ADHD in childhood continue to have the disorder throughout adulthood. In the US, 4.4 percent of adults have ADHD. Of all these individuals, 38 percent are women and 62 percent are men.\nHow Common Is Substance Abuse in Individuals with ADHD?\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics notes those with ADHD are twice as likely to use nicotine, in particular, throughout life. They’re also three times more likely to become dependent on nicotine during adolescence or adulthood.\nThose with ADHD are twice as likely to abuse or become dependent on alcohol. They’re 1.5 times more likely to develop a marijuana use disorder. Those with ADHD are twice as likely to abuse cocaine or become dependent on it.\nThe Medscape Journal of Medicine published a piece regarding how substance abuse is higher in individuals with ADHD than those who don’t have ADHD. The risk of substance abuse is about 50 percent higher in subjects who had childhood ADHD that persisted into adulthood.\nIn some cases, people may misuse medications that are prescribed to treat ADHD. Of 21 different studies reviewed, nonprescription use of stimulants ranged from 5-9 percent in grade school and high school children. The range of college-aged individuals who abuse stimulants was 5-35 percent. One study conducted on a large university in the mid-Atlantic region found 26.7 percent of students who had an ADHD diagnosis used more of their medication than prescribed.\nThose with ADHD may also combine their prescribed medications with substances of abuse. This practice of polysubstance abuse increases the risks associated with each substance.\nReasons for Substance Abuse\nOftentimes, a person with ADHD self-medicates to seek relief from symptoms of the condition. They may have self-esteem issues as a result of the condition, especially if they feel they are looked down upon due to their symptoms, and they may turn to stimulants like cocaine to boost their energy and feelings of self-worth. They may use depressants, like marijuana, to seek calm or relaxation.\nResearch presented by the National Institute on ADHD shows that individuals who are treated for ADHD with stimulants aren’t more likely to abuse ADHD medications than their peers who don’t have legitimate prescriptions. Those on a stimulant aren’t more likely to abuse cocaine either. Those who have their ADHD under control are actually less likely to engage in illegal drug use than those who aren’t medicated. The key is that the person has been properly diagnosed and is taking medication under the supervision of a doctor.\nIndividuals with ADHD may have more than one mental health issue, and this may increase the likelihood that they’ll abuse substances. In fact, over two-thirds of people with ADHD have at least one other co-occurring disorder, as noted by Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD). Approximately 40 percent of people who have ADHD have oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and 38 percent have a coexisting mood disorder.\nChildren with ADHD are more likely to be depressed than children without ADHD. About 14 percent of kids with ADHD have depression while only 1 percent of children who don’t have ADHD have depression. Up to 20 percent of people with ADHD exhibit symptoms of bipolar disorder. Fifty-three percent of adults who have ADHD also have anxiety while up to 30 percent of children with ADHD have anxiety. Between one-quarter to one-half of parents with children with ADHD report their child has a problem sleeping.\nAgain, people who suffer from co-occurring disorders are even more likely to self-medicate with substances of abuse.\nIndividuals who have ADHD are impulsive. If they are in a situation where drugs and alcohol are present, they may try them without thinking about the consequences. The poor judgment often associated with ADHD also contributes to substance abuse.\nIt’s suggested that people who have ADHD are more biologically vulnerable to develop an addiction than their peers without ADHD. Additionally, the same receptors in the brain involved in ADHD are involved in substance abuse problems. For instance, dopamine transmission is part of both ADHD and substance use disorders. When compared to individuals without ADHD, those with ADHD have higher densities of dopamine transporters. This may cause low levels of synaptic dopamine. Many drugs, such as amphetamines, methamphetamines, cocaine, nicotine, opiates, marijuana, and ecstasy, increase dopamine concentration, resulting in positive feelings that encourage repeated use.\nTreatment for ADHD and Substance Abuse\nIn order to successfully treat both issues, treatment for co-occurring disorders is needed. Neither addiction or ADHD is curable, so treatment will focus on managing both disorders. With comprehensive, evidence-based care, a person suffering from ADHD and a substance use disorder can achieve full recovery.\nOftentimes, clients are placed on medications to manage their ADHD. For instance, methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, or amphetamine may be used, under the brand names Ritalin, Adderall, and Vyvanse. If the client is at risk for abusing these substances, a doctor may prescribe a nonstimulant medication. Nonstimulants are considered secondary medications, meaning they are not the most commonly accepted medications to treat the condition. Examples of nonstimulants used to treat ADHD include:\n- Tricyclic antidepressants\nWhile medications can be critical to managing symptoms, therapy is the foundation of treatment. During therapy, clients will learn ways to manage certain symptoms of ADHD. They’ll also address the underlying issues that led to the initial substance abuse, and they’ll learn how to manage triggers that tempt them to use again.\nIn a co-occurring disorders treatment program, both the ADHD and the substance use disorder will be treated simultaneously so therapy will address both conditions. Most often, therapy takes place on both an individual and group basis, and complementary therapies may also be used to ensure a robust approach to recovery.']	['<urn:uuid:dd34773b-1558-4171-aa7e-15b1cbbe10f6>', '<urn:uuid:b796d638-429c-4e0f-b034-7b8d019082d0>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	7	59	2056
55	difference between cleaning wood stove glass versus cleaning hvac ducts airflow requirements	Cleaning a wood stove's glass doors requires simple tools like Rutland's Conditioning Glass Cleaner and a damp rag, using circular motions to wipe off creosote buildup. In contrast, cleaning HVAC ducts requires careful consideration of airflow requirements - ducts must be properly sized to deliver specific CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) rates, with 4-inch ducts handling 20 CFM, 6-inch ducts 75 CFM, up to 16-inch ducts carrying 1000 CFM. The cleaning approach differs because wood stoves deal with creosote buildup on glass, while HVAC systems must maintain specific airflow rates for proper ventilation.

This is a great option for homeowners that are going to be cleaning their chimney or for professionals that are cleaning customer’s chimneys. This suit will help to protect your clothing from being covered or stained with black creosote from cleaning your chimney or woodstove.\nNow let’s talk about a couple of our most popular ash vacuums; the Cheetah II and the Cougar Quiet Ash Vacuum. These are both made by Loveless Ash and are a great option for fireplaces and woodstoves. An additional option that may be added to the ash vacuum is the 3 piece tool kit. This tool kit will include a brush adapter, crevice tool, and also the pellet stove attachment.\nToday we are going to touch base on how to use the ash vacuum on a wood stove. You are going to start off with the angled tool. This piece comes with the ash vacuum. You will use this tool to clean up all of the cool ash out of the woodstoves firebox. You will want to make sure that the hot embers are removed and the ash is cooled enough that you can hold your hand over them for a 10 second count. If you are unable to count to 10 with your hand over the ash pile it is still too hot and may damage the rubber hosing. When you begin vacuuming with this attachment you will want to make sure that you are at about a 45 degree angle to the woodstove surface you are cleaning. Once the firebox is cleaned of the ash you will then continue with the crevice or angled tool to get into the corners and joints of the firebox making sure all ash residues are cleaned away. This tool is also great for cleaning up the hearth board. Another tool that is very handy when cleaning your woodstove, especially if you have glass doors, is the brush tool. The brush tools soft bristles allows you to clean the glass doors and outer surface of your woodstove without leaving scuffs or scratches behind. The ash vacuum makes removing ash and dust a breeze, you have the inside of the woodstove and the outside done all at once.\nNow on to checking the drafting of your woodstove, smoke pellets are a great product to assist in checking your draft. You will simply place one pellet in the firebox and light it. It will then begin to smoke and if your woodstove is drafting properly the smoke will get sucked right up the flue. If you have any down drafts at all or smoke coming into the room instead of up the flue you will have further inspecting of the venting system to do. Some of the issues that may arise could consist of the type of chimney cap or if there is one at all, the venting system may not be tall enough or may be too tall. These smoke pellets may also be used in fireplaces and they come in a quantity of 6 per package. It is recommended that you do not inhale the smoke from the pellets and to keep all children and pets out of the room that the flue is being tested in.\nOne other thing to check if you are having smoke coming back into the room is whether or not you have a blockage in the chimney or venting system. If you do see an object obstructing the pipe or chimney you can use a ProFlex Harpoon tool or a ProFlex Retrieving tool to remove the obstruction. Regular chimney cleaning helps to prevent any obstruction from occurring and will also allow them to be caught right away.\nTo keep with the cleaning of your woodstove we are going to take a look at Rutland’s Conditioning Glass Cleaner. This glass cleaner is going to be helpful in removing that built up creosote on your glass doors that is blocking your view of the beautiful fire inside the woodstove. This product may also be used on glass fireplace doors as well. All you will need in addition to the cleaner is a damp rag, paper towel, or newspaper works good as well. Put a small amount on your rag, wipe it onto the glass surface a in a circular motion and watch the creosote wipe right off. Rutland’s Glass Cleaner is a non-abrasive, conditioning cleaner so you will not have to worry about scratching the glass and it will also protect for future cleanings preventing creosote from sticking on the glass.\nTool sets are essential for everyday use with a woodstove. You can find tools sets in several different styles, colors, lengths and sizes. There are four tools that are commonly included in the tool sets and they are the poker, shovel, broom, and a pair of tongs. Tools sets are very handy to have near your woodstove, they are going to help with all of your basic needs for tending your fire.\nWood holders are another must have item when you have a woodstove. They help keep a small amount of wood nice and tidy. Some may even come with a nice leather wood carrier that is perfect for keeping all of the debris contained and from dropping on the floor as you bring wood in from outdoors. The wood carrier prevents the need for extra clean up when hauling in wood. Both the wood holder and the carrier are available in many different colors and sizes. Some wood holders come with a shelf underneath for kindling and fire starters. It all depends on what your needs are for your hearth.\nThe time has come for us to start a fire in our woodstove. To start the fire we are going to use Rutland’s Safe Lite Fire Starters. These fire starters are available in a 24 or 144 count package. They are very simple to use; you will just open the package, break off one square and place it in the center of the firebox, light the corner of the square to do this our Long Fireplace Matches are perfect. Place two sticks of Fatwood, which is a kindling type of fire starter, or any type of kindling on the Safe Lite square and then it is time to add a dry seasoned log on top of the Fatwood. To place the log in it is better to be as safe as possible and use a pair of fireplace gloves. I prefer the Long Arm 20” Fireplace Gloves but they do also come in a 13 ½” length as well.\nOnce the log is in place and right before the fire really starts to take off is the perfect time to spray the log with some ACS-Anti-Creo-Soot Spray. This will help prevent creosote buildup in the woodstoves chimney pipe. The ACS comes in a quart size or a gallon size. I recommend purchasing a quart and a gallon to refill the quart as needed for a busy burning season. You will want to spray the log itself about 2-3 times. Once the fire is burning it will release the chemicals from the ACS and up the flue to break up any creosote that is in the flue as well as prevent more from building.\nWhen burning a woodstove the air in the home tends to be dry because they put off such a hot dry heat. Kettles or Steamers are a great addition for a woodstove to help put the moisture back in the air. They come available in a large array of sizes and colors. They are available in cast iron with a porcelain enamel finish or just cast iron alone. There is a style of steamer to match any décor. You can also use the steamer or kettle to add fragrance to your room by using the fragrance oils by Stove Scents.\nKwik Shot Soot Stopper Toss In Creosote Removers are a great product to have on hand with having a woodstove. This type of creosote remover is very convenient to use for maintenance on your chimney flue whether it be a wood stove or a fireplace flue. All you do is toss one into a solid burning fire and let it start working. It is recommended that you use these once every 1-2 weeks depending on how quickly the creosote builds up in your flue. The Kwik Shot Soot Stoppers will help break down the existing creosote buildup into a brushable ash and also prevent the future buildup of creosote from forming.\nTo ensure that your woodstove is burning at optimal temperatures for that particular woodstove a Woodstove Thermometer is a necessity. Every woodstoves optimal burning temperature is different. Making sure that your woodstove is burning between the right temperature range helps to cut down on the amount of creosote buildup in your flue. There are several different styles for woodstove thermometers on the market. We offer a good selection to choose from as well.\nOne major concern for homeowners that heat with a woodstove or a fireplace is the occurrence of a chimney fire. Just to be prepared for the possibility of a chimney fire purchase Chimfex Fire Suppressants. Chimfex is a great product to have readily available and is very simple to use. The directions are right on the back of the box. It is recommended that you read the directions to familiarize yourself with how to use the product so in the occurrence of a chimney fire you will already know how to use the product and can act quickly.\nTo circulate as much heat as possible throughout your home consider adding an Ecofan to your woodstove. Ecofans generate their own electricity from the surface heat of your wood stove and circulate warm air throughout the room, increasing your comfort and fuel efficiency. The Ecofan comes in 2 or 3 blade models and you can get the blades in gold, silver, or black. This fan pushes approximately 100 CFMs. Optimal working temperature range is 450-600 degrees this is when you will see the fan working at max speed.\nI hope you found the information on the Basics of How to Care for Your Woodstove helpful and do not forget NorthlineExpress is your one stop shop for all of your woodstove accessories.', 'Time Saver: If you’re looking for a quick & easy calculation and already know the principles of CFM and ACH, use the Navigation tool to jump to the Pick HVAC CFM Calculator which gives CFM needed based on the number of ACH your space requires.\nOK, for most of us, let’s take it a little slower.\nCFM, or Cubic Feet per Minute, is a factor overlooked by some homeowners even though they want good indoor air quality (IAQ) and an HVAC system that adequately and efficiently circulates it.\nThis page begins with quick answers for those who want the information and need to get on with their day.\nThen it digs deeper into the concept of CFM, how it is measured, the importance of ACH (air changes per hour) and, of course, methods for calculating CFM. A CFM and Air Changes per Hour FAQ covers additional ground in this important topic.\nThe Pick HVAC CFM Calculator is featured – and it gives you the ACH number you’re looking for. From there, you can determine if your current system is powerful enough to meet the airflow and air changes needs in your home.\nHow many CFM do I need?\nAnswer #1: 350 – 400 CFM per ton of HVAC capacity.\nThat’s the answer to the question: What CFM do I need for my HVAC system to do its job?\nThis answer of 350-400 cubic feet per minute for each 12,000 BTUs of AC cooling is optimal for the system to run efficiently while adequately cooling and dehumidifying the space.\n- 12,000 BTUs = 1 Ton\n- 24,000 BTUs = 2 Tons, and so forth\nResidential systems range from 1.5 to 5.0 tons, or 18,000 to 60,000 BTUs.\nThe CFM rating applies to heating too. At 350-400 CFM per 12,000 BTUs of heating capacity, there’s enough airflow to circulate heated air through supply ducts and pull cool air back to the furnace or air handler through the cold air returns.\nA 3-ton unit, or 36,000 BTUs, would need a blower capable of moving 3 x 350-400 CFM, so a total of 1,050 to 1,200 CFM.\nAnswer #2: The CFM needed for a specific room depends on the size of the room and how often you want its air to be changed.\nThis is the answer to the question: How many CFM do I need to give me the right ACH?\nThe concept of ACH, or air changes per hour, is totally explained below. And there are step-by-step calculations and examples plus charts.\nBut here’s a quick example. Let’s say you have a 15 x 20 kitchen with an 8-foot ceiling height, and you’re cooking. Think lots of heat and possibly some moisture vapor from boiling pasta. You want the heat and humidity gone…\nRoom in cubic feet: 15 x 20 x 8 = 2,400\nACH (air changes per hour) Desired: 10 ACH, or every 6 minutes.\n- 2,400 / 6 = 400 CFM\nFor the kitchen to remain comfortable, the HVAC ductwork would need to deliver 400 CFM of fresh air.\nNote that the minutes required for the air to change once is the important number. This is because airflow is in CFM-cubic feet per minute, and you want the air to change every 6 minutes.\nIf the room is a living room, and 5 ACH is enough, then changing it every 12 minutes would be right (5 x 12 = 60). The equation would be:\n- 2,400 / 12 = 200 CFM\nAll the calculators you find online, including ours, “do the math” for you by converting how many ACH you desire into how many minutes per change.\n- 15 ACH = 4 minutes each\n- 10 ACH = 6 minutes each\n- 8 ACH = 7.5 minutes each, etc.\nAll this is explained fully as we go.\nCFM Calculator: How Many CFM Do I Need?\nLet’s walk through this calculator together.\nStep 1 – Room Size in Square Feet\nMeasure the length times the width to get square feet.\nIf the room is L-shaped or has a bump-out in the middle, then measure and multiply each rectangle separately and add them together.\nStep 2 – Ceiling Height\nMeasure the floor to ceiling. If it is a vaulted ceiling, choose a height about halfway up the slope. That’s the simplest approach, and your result will be accurate.\nStep 3 – Air Changes Per Hour (ACH)\nInput the ACH.\nStep 4 – View the CFM needed\nThe number of CFM needed to achieve the desired ACH will display automatically.\nAgain, our CFM Calculator, like those the pros use, converts the number of ACH desired into the minutes it takes per air change and uses the number of minutes an air change takes in the calculation.\nHow to Calculate Room CFM – An Example\nYou can check this example with the CFM Calculator above. Try various inputs to see how the data changes as you change room size and necessary ACH – air changes per hour.\nRoom size: 400 square feet with 10-foot ceilings, or 4,000 cubic feet\nAir change frequency: We want the air changed every 12 minutes, so ACH = 5\nDoing it by hand, we use the CFM formula, CFM = Area x Height x ACH / 60\nPlugging in the values, the equation is:\n400 (area) x 10 (ceiling height) x 5 (desired ACH) / 60 minutes = 334\nCFM – What is It In HVAC?\nCubic feet per minute, or CFM, is a measurement of how much air a fan moves. It addresses the often-overlooked “V” in HVAC – ventilation.\nThe CFM potential of a blower is determined by the horsepower capacity of the motor and the size of the blower’s fan. The blower fan assemblies are factory designed and tested, and then they are given a CFM rating – meaning they are rated for how many cubic feet (one foot x one foot x one foot) of air they have the ability to push through your ductwork every minute.\nCalculating CFM per square foot is determined with this information:\n- Size of the HVAC system (1.5 to 5.0 tons)\n- Rating of the blower in CFM (Most are 350-400 CFM per ton)\n- Square foot of the space served by the HVAC system\nThe equation is:\nTonnage x CFM of the blower / Number of square feet\n4-ton AC x 400 CFM blower / 2,000 square feet = 0.8 CFM per square foot.\nA room that is 200 square feet would receive 160 CFM\nACH – Determining the number of air changes per hour (ACH) that this system would deliver takes more calculating.\nLet’s say the ceiling height is 8 feet. The room is 1,600 cubic feet. At 160 CFM, the air in the room would be changed in 10 minutes. This would produce 6 air changes per hour.\nIf you wanted more frequent changes, you would have to supply more air to the room along with an additional return vent. More of the system’s total CFM would need to be directed to the kitchen, in other words.\nCFM Airflow Based on HVAC System Size\nThe larger the system size – when a properly sized blower is chosen – the more CFM it can deliver. Knowing how many CFM your system is capable of is essential to figuring CFM per room and how long it takes to change the air in those rooms.\nHow many cfm for 1 – 5 ton ac unit ?\nCooling CapacityCFM (Airflow) How many CFM is a 1 ton ac unit?350 – 400 CFM How many CFM is a 1.5 ton ac unit?525 – 600 CFM How many CFM is a 2 ton ac unit?700 – 800 CFM How many CFM is a 2.5 ton ac unit?875 – 1000 CFM How many CFM is a 3 ton ac unit?1050 – 1200 CFM How many CFM is a 3.5 ton ac unit?1225 – 1400 CFM How many CFM is a 4 ton ac unit?1400 – 1600 CFM How many CFM is a 5 ton ac unit?1750 – 2000 CFM\nHow many cfm for 60,000 – 160,000 BTU furnace ?\nFurnace CapacityCFM (Airflow) How many CFM is a 60,000 BTU furnace?1750 – 2000 CFM How many CFM is a 80,000 BTU furnace?2320 – 2250 CFM How many CFM is a 100,000 BTU furnace?2920 – 3325 CFM How many CFM is a 120,000 BTU furnace?3500 – 4000 CFM How many CFM is a 125,000 BTU furnace?3645 – 4165 CFM How many CFM is a 135,000 BTU furnace?3935 – 4500 CFM How many CFM is a 140,000 BTU furnace?4085 – 4670 CFM How many CFM is a 160,000 BTU furnace?4670 – 5350 CFM\nCFM and Common Room Sizes\nHow many CFM do I need for a 12×12 room? 16×16?\nThe answer is that it depends on how often you want the air to change. This chart uses room size per square foot rather than dimensions.\nIt shows how many CFM you need for 2 air changes per hour, or 2 ACH. If you want 4 ACH, multiply CFM needed by 2, and so forth.\nRoom SizeCFM (At 2 ACH) How many CFM for 200 square feet?53 CFM How many CFM for 500 square feet?133 CFM How many CFM for 700 square feet?187 CFM How many CFM for 900 square feet?240 CFM How many CFM for 1,000 square feet?267 CFM How many CFM for 1,500 square feet?400 CFM How many CFM for 2,000 square feet?533 CFM How many CFM for 3,000 square feet?800 CFM\nWhat CFM is Best? High CFM? Low CFM?\nThe CFM level needs to be “just right” in order for the best indoor climate control and indoor air quality (IAQ).\nIs high CFM better? No. There are several negative results of too high CFM. First, do you want a breeze flowing through your house? At times, that might be nice, but generally no, when the heat is just right in winter and the AC temp is perfect in summer, a breeze isn’t appreciated.\nWhat about humidity? Your AC system does more than cool the air by removing heat. It dries the air by removing humidity.\nIt dehumidifies the air by passing it over the very cold evaporator coil. Moisture in the air condenses on the coil, runs into a drain and is removed from your home.\nWhen air is passing over the coil too quickly, the moisture doesn’t condense out of it. In fact, the airflow might pick up some moisture. The result will be high humidity that will make the air clammy and will potentially lead to mold and mildew in your home.\nIs low CFM better? No.\nThink about a furnace that makes 100,000 BTUs of heat, but barely moves the air! The heat wouldn’t get circulated, and the rooms near your furnace might be too hot, while the furthest from the furnace would be cold.\nIn summer, the issue would be reversed.\n350-400 CFM per ton is best. Over many years of experimentation and testing, HVAC manufacturers have agreed on this CFM range.\nIt provides the most efficient and comfortable heating, air conditioning and ventilation for your home.\nIndoor Air Quality and Air Changes per Minute\nIndoor air can be stale, musty and even polluted.\nSome rooms are worse than others – a kitchen with cooking odors and moisture, a home workshop where a table saw is creating dust, or a dining room with 8 chatting people, for example.\nThese rooms need more airflow – the air needs to be changed more frequently, for example, than in an office occupied by one person. To do this, CFM needs to be higher in those rooms.\nACH, CFM and Ductwork\nThe ducts in your home must be sized properly to deliver the right CFM of air, so that the ACH number can be what you want it to be.\nA 4 inch (4-inch) duct delivers less CFM than a 6 inch duct, for example, which is obvious. See the Ductwork Size and CFM Chart below for details.\nSizing ductwork is one of the most challenging tasks for pro HVAC technicians. It involves computer programs that take into account a lot of data including HVAC system size, blower CFM rating, room sizes, the length of duct runs and much more. “Winging it” DIY isn’t the best option for assuring each room in your home is as comfortable as you want it to be.\nPick HVAC has completed a Complete Guide to Ductwork and will continue to provide resources about this vital, but not well-understood, part of heating, air conditioning and ventilation.\nHow many CFM per square foot are needed?\nAs with so much of this information in this CFM Calculator Guide, it depends on the desired ACH.\nWith the standard 8-foot ceiling, and based on the number of ACH required (shown by ACH = #) and explained below.\n- ACH = 1 provides .135 CFM per square foot\n- ACH = 2 provides .27 CFM per square foot\n- ACH = 3 provides .40 CFM per square foot\n- ACH = 4 provides .54 CFM per square foot\n- ACH = 5 provides .67 CFM per square foot\n- ACH = 6 provides .80 CFM per square foot\n- ACH = 7 provides .94 CFM per square foot\n- ACH = 8 provides 1.08 CFM per square foot\n- ACH = 9 provides 1.22 CFM per square foot\n- ACH = 10 provides 1.35 CFM per square foot\nWhat does this mean? If you only need the air changed 1 time per hour (ACH = 1), then just .135 CFM is needed per square foot of space.\nSo, a 100 square foot room would need 13.5 CFM. A 1,000 square foot room would need 135 CFM.\nOn the upper end, if you want ACH = 10, or the air changed 10 times per hour, then:\nA 100 square foot room would need 135 CFM.\nA 1,000 square foot space would need 1,350 CFM\nAirflow CFM FAQs\nWe’ve covered the essentials, but here is additional information, with some overlap.\nWhat types of equipment does CFM apply to?\nWhile we’ve discussed mainly central HVAC systems, fans of all types are rated for CFM.\nCFM rating and the desired ACH – air changes per hour – should be considered when shopping for ductless air conditioners and heat pumps, ceiling fans, whole house fans and attic fans, garage heaters, dehumidifiers, air purifiers, room air conditioners such as window and portable ACs, and even simple window/box fans.\nCan CFM Be Different Room to Room?\nYes, in fact it needs to be in order to achieve the number of air changes per hour, ACH, desired.\nFor example, let’s say you have a 150 square foot bedroom and a 150 square foot kitchen. The ACH recommendation for kitchens is double or higher than for bedrooms.\nConsequently, you’re going to need more air going into and out of the kitchen than the bedroom.\nThis will be achieved with larger and/or more supply ducts feeding the room with fresh air and return ducts taking stale air back to the furnace or air handler.\nHow many CFM are needed to achieve the right ACH?\nIt depends on a few factors.\nSomeone might ask, “We have a 200 square foot bedroom, and I like fresh air. How much CFM do we need to change the air five times per hour?”\nThat’s changing the air every 12 minutes, since 12 x 5 = 60 minutes.\nIf the ceiling is 8 feet high, the room is 1,600 ft3, or 1,600 cubic feet.\nTo change the air five times, the system would have to deliver 5 x 1,600 cubic feet per hour, or 8,000.\nSince CFM is “per minute,” let’s divide 8,000 by 60 (minutes per hour) to get 133 CFM.\nYou would need 133 CFM.\nMost HVAC equipment and ductwork systems can easily supply that amount of airflow.\nWhat size ductwork do I need?\nIt depends on the CFM you want to move through them. Here’s a brief duct diameter CFM chart for common duct sizes.\n- 4 inch ducts carry 20 CFM\n- 6 inch ducts carry 75 CFM\n- 8 inch ducts carry 160 CFM\n- 10 inch ducts carry 300 CFM\n- 12 inch ducts carry 480 CFM\n- 14 inch ducts carry 700 CFM\n- 16 inch ducts carry 1000 CFM\nImportant tip: The duct runs together should not greatly exceed the total possible CFM output of the HVAC system – unless you have a zoned system that allows you to mechanically close runs to space/rooms that aren’t being used.\nCFM capability for round metal ducts and rectangular ducts are different, as this interesting chart shows.\nNote that metal allows more airflow than flex duct because the interior is smoother. There is less friction, and friction slows air and reduces CFM.\nThrough this article, we hope to help you understand What size return grill for 2.5 ton unit']	['<urn:uuid:c2be33d7-26cc-4ffb-9bd0-f2d53dc30880>', '<urn:uuid:e87abfc6-5959-4cc4-9f7b-94ed59d97e30>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	12	93	4658
56	acute injury rice treatment time duration ice compression elevation	For acute injuries, RICE treatment should be applied for the first 24-48 hours. Rest should be immediate to allow fiber healing, ice should be applied for up to 20 minutes per session with breaks between applications, compression should be firm with strapping, and elevation should keep the injured area above the torso. Ice applications should be repeated every 2-3 hours for the first 3 days.	['Most people are understandably confused about what constitutes a sprain and what constitutes a strain. Both injuries cause pain and can interfere with your ability to move. The difference is really quite small: a strain involves injury to a muscle or tendon and a sprain involves injury to a ligament.\nTendons are the type of connective tissue that attaches your muscles to your bones. Strains happen when a tendon or muscle becomes overstretched or excessively stressed, losing much of its ability to contract, either during an acute injury or over time. If the injury happens over a length of time, it is referred to as an overuse injury. Carpal tunnel syndrome from excessive use of a keyboard is an example of this type of strain injury. Symptoms of a strain injury include weakness, local pain or tenderness and muscle spasms. One of the most common kinds of strain injury occurs when people hurt their back muscles by trying to lift something that is too heavy in an improper manner (by lifting with the back instead of the legs).\nLigaments (the connective tissue that attaches two bones to each other at a joint) are intended to help support the movement of a joint only in specific directions. For instance, the joint at your knee is a hinge that allows for forward and backward movement, though in normal situations it only allows for very limited side-to-side movement at the joint. Sprains occur when a ligament either stretches excessively, tears or completely separates due to acute stress that puts the joint out of place and subsequently injures the ligament. Symptoms of a sprain are more outwardly obvious, involving swelling, bruising, pain and instability around the joint.\nBoth sprains and strains are placed into one of three categories based on severity:\n- Grade I. A minor injury to the muscle, tendon or ligament involving a slight overstretching or minor tearing.\n- Grade II. A moderate injury to the muscle, tendon or ligament in which the tissue is partially torn but still connected.\n- Grade III. A severe injury to the muscle, tendon or ligament that involves a complete rupture of the affected tissue.\n- A physician should be consulted in the case of a severe sprain or strain. Treatment for mild to moderate cases of both types of injuries is the same: RICE.\n- R is for Rest. Do not move the injured part for two or three days after the injury.\n- I is for Ice. Apply ice to the sprain or strain for 10-20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours for the first 3 days.\n- C is for Compression. Wrap the injury lightly but firmly in a compression bandage to support the joint and help keep swelling down.\n- E is for Elevation. Keep the injury elevated to reduce swelling.\nSprains take longer to heal than strains, as ligaments have less blood supply than tendons and muscles. The severity of the injury obviously also influences the amount of recovery time needed. A Grade I sprain generally heals within 1 to 3 weeks while a Grade II sprain heals within 6 to 8 weeks and a Grade III sprain can take up to a year to heal.', 'Acute injury treatment\nIt is good to see that more and more people are feeling inspired and motivated to take up sports and other physical activities. As a result I am being contacted by more people seeking advice and treatment for injuries. Actually, this advice applies whether you injured yourself whilst playing sport or while carrying the shopping.\nWhen the injury has just occurred it requires ACUTE treatment, usually for the following 24-48 hours.\nA strain to a muscle or a tendon is a common type of acute injury. I usually generalise and call it a pulled muscle. This occurs when the tissue fibres become torn or damaged, due to overloading, twisting or stretching. This may result in heat, pain, redness, swelling and loss of function in the area.\nA sprain to a ligament is another common type of acute injury. This is when fibres of a ligament, which supports the joints, are torn. This can happen when a joint is forced beyond its normal range of movement. This may result in considerable swelling, bruising and pain with any attempt to move or put pressure on the joint.\nDoing the right things as soon as injury occurs will aid quicker recovery and hopefully prevent it from becoming a chronic on-going issue.\nI suggest following the RICE procedure. That is Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation for the first 24 48 hours after the injury.\nRest – immediate rest from any movement of the area involved will allow the fibres to start to knit together. Rest will also allow any bleeding to stop naturally. Resist the temptation to try and use the injured part, to see if it still hurts.\nIce – ice should be applied as soon as possible, as this reduces the amount of bleeding and swelling in the tissues. Ice has a pain relieving aspect too, as it numbs the pain receptors. Reducing the pain also reduces the protective spasm around the area. A pack of frozen peas is ideal as it can be moulded to fit the area, put a layer of kitchen roll or a thin cloth between your skin and an icepack. Ice cubes can be wrapped in a wet cloth. Using an anti-inflammatory ointment on the skin whilst moving ice slowly and smoothly over the area, can be an effective combination.\nThe length of time to leave an icepack on depends on the area but your shouldn’t leave it on for more than twenty minutes at a time. If your skin looks red after the ice is removed, then it was on for too long. Ice the area as often as you can, just make sure that you have given enough time in between sessions for your skin to return to its normal temperature, before re-applying it.\nCompression – compression or pressure should be applied over the injured area. This can be applied using a firm pad with a strapping around it to hold it in place. Compression restricts bleeding at the injury site.\nElevation – a leg or arm should be comfortably supported so that it is raised higher than the torso. This will allow gravity to assist in the removal of swelling in the area and so aid recovery.\nI can give you general massage using techniques to improve lymphatic drainage which will help to reduce swelling. Massage can be very beneficial and can be given at the same time as the RICE procedure.\nAll acute injuries should, ideally, be seen by a medical practitioner as soon as possible.']	['<urn:uuid:ce43c32e-6ae4-4efd-a516-69fb40a893d7>', '<urn:uuid:fc9558c6-a61f-4c91-a273-927d8cf0960a>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	9	65	1121
57	meaning celtic name connor what animal	Conner is a name meaning 'wolf lover'.	['The meaning of names very often sources back to the Bible, the Norman Conquest or to culturally specific definitions and interpretations. From the Bible, the Gabriel is a Hebrew name meaning “God is my strength.” Daniel is a Hebrew name meaning “God is my judge.” Michael is a Hebrew name meaning “Who is like god?” Noah originates of Hebrew and is a name meaning “rest” or “repose”.\nMany names for girls also originate of the Bible. Rachel is of Hebrew origin and means “ewe” or “female sheep”. Eve, although primarily an English name also originates of Hebrew and means “living”, “life” or “breath”. Mary is a Hebrew name meaning “beloved” or “wished for child”.\nNature Name Meanings\nNature provides infinite name sources and ideas, whose meanings are generally self-evident. From the high-flying Robin or Swan to precious gems and metals including Ruby, Pearl or Goldie, suitable for a Prince or a Queen. Nature itself offers Flora, derived of Latin and a name meaning “flower”. Flora was the Roman goddess of flowers and spring. Similarly, Fauna was the Greek goddess of fertility and nature. Fauve originates of the French and is a name meaning “wild” and “uninhibited”. For garden variety names, newly expecting parents might consider Rose, Daisy, Lotus, Dahlia, Iris, Lily or Jasmine.\nOf course, nature also provide myriad opportunities for masculine names including Buck, Rock, Forest, Glen, Heath, Indigo, Reed, Rowan or River. (Although the names Indigo and River have crossed gender lines to become unisex in meaning.)\nOccupational Name Meanings\nOccupational name meanings are for the most part, self-evident. In many instances, occupational names have evolved from family surnames to become beloved baby names. Occupational baby name ideas can include Fisher, Archer, Baker, Hunter, Parker, Mason, Paige, Piper, Porter, Scout or the updated, modern and increasingly popular Taylor.\nPlace Name Meanings\nPlace name meanings, as with occupational name meanings are typically self-evident and cross borders, cultures and languages. Plan name ideas include Paris, Dakota, Brooklyn, France, Sydney, Austin, America, Cody and Dallas among many, many more.\nHeavenly Name Meanings\nMany baby names are aspirational and each is individual and inspirational in portending success in years to come. But some reach all the way to the heavens, Valhalla, Olympus and beyond. Apollo, the son of Zeus, is a name meaning associated with medicine, music, art, law, beauty, wisdom and more. Conversely, Apollo is also associated with the Greek verb to destroy. The name meaning of Diana is “heavenly” or “divine” and she was the Roman Goddess of the moon, hunting, forests and childbirth. Zeus is a name meaning “shine” or “sky” and he was the god who ruled over the earth and the whole of mankind. As the son of God in Roman Catholicism, Jesus has a name meaning believed to be “savior”. From Arabic, Mohammed has a name meaning of “praiseworthy” or “glorified”. Athena has a name meaning associated with wisdom. From the Norse gods, Thor has a name meaning associated with thunder and, as the son of Odin, was the god of strength, thunder, war and storms. Phoebe has a meaning of “bright” and “shining”. Mars -- the god of war -- and Paris – the prince of Troy -- are also place names – although Mars was a god long before being named for a planet.\nIrish Name Meanings\nThe Emerald Isle has proferred an abundance of baby name ideas that have endured across centuries. Ryan has a name meaning of “kingly”. Kevin is a name meaning “handsome”. Sean is derived of the Biblical John and means “God is good”. Conner – ever-increasing in popularity is a name meaning “wolf lover”. Riley is a name meaning “brave” and is generally thought and evolution of a surname to become a given name. Shannon is a name meaning “old and wise”. Saoirse, which rhymes with inertia, is a name meaning “freedom”.\nItalian Name Meanings\nItalian names and name meanings are somewhat iterative, evolved of Roman, Latin, Biblical and Greek influences. As with many cultures, many Italian names are patronymic, meaning they have been handed down from generations before. Popular Italian boy names include Angelo, a name meaning “angel” or “messenger”. Alberto, Latinized from the Germanic, Albert, and a name meaning “noble”. Antonio, a name meaning “praiseworthy”. Dario, evolved of the Greek Darius and a name meaning “kingly”. Vito is a name meaning “life”.\nPopular Italian girl names include Sofia a name meaning “wisdom” or “skill”. Giulia evolved of Julius and a name meaning “youthful”. Francesca, evolved from French and a name meaning “free one”. Maria originating of Latin by way of Hebrew and a name meaning believed to be “wished for child”. Angelica, the feminization of Angelo and a name meaning “messenger” or “angel”. Valentina is a name meaning “healthy” or “strong”.']	['<urn:uuid:592fca37-f22d-4b6b-92ed-6dec4a7b70b3>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	6	7	794
58	Which view of pleasure is more positive: Epicurus' or the Cyrenaics'?	The Cyrenaics had a more positive view of pleasure, particularly physical pleasure. While both schools considered pleasure the highest good, the Cyrenaics advocated for actively pursuing positive pleasurable sensations, especially physical ones. In contrast, Epicurus defined pleasure more modestly as the absence of pain and emphasized achieving tranquility and freedom from fear rather than seeking intense physical gratification.	"['The Cyrenaics or Kyrenaics (Ancient Greek: Κυρηναϊκοί; Kyrēnaïkoí) were a sensual hedonist Greek school of philosophy founded in the 4th century BCE, supposedly by Aristippus of Cyrene, although many of the principles of the school are believed to have been formalized by his grandson of the same name, Aristippus the Younger. The school was so called after Cyrene, the birthplace of Aristippus. It was one of the earliest Socratic schools. The Cyrenaics taught that the only intrinsic good is pleasure, which meant not just the absence of pain, (as it did for Epicurus) but positively enjoyable sensations. Of these, momentary pleasures, especially physical ones, are stronger than those of anticipation or memory. They did, however, recognize the value of social obligation and that pleasure could be gained from altruistic behaviour. The school died out within a century and was replaced by the philosophy of Epicureanism.\nHistory of the school\n|Part of a series on|\nThe history of the Cyrenaic school begins with Aristippus of Cyrene, who was born around 435 BCE. He came to Athens as a young man and became a pupil of Socrates. We have only limited knowledge of his movements after the execution of Socrates in 399 BCE, although he is said to have lived for a time in the court of Dionysius of Syracuse.\nIt is uncertain precisely which doctrines ascribed to the Cyrenaic school were formulated by Aristippus. Diogenes Laërtius, based on the authority of Sotion and Panaetius, provided a long list of books said to have been written by Aristippus. However, Diogenes also wrote that Sosicrates had stated that Aristippus had written nothing. Among Aristippus\' pupils was his daughter, Arete of Cyrene, who passed on his teachings to her own son Aristippus the Younger. It was he, according to Aristocles, who turned the teachings of his grandfather into a comprehensive system. At the least, however, it can be said that the foundations of Cyrenaic philosophy were ideas originated by the elder Aristippus.\nAfter the time of the younger Aristippus, the school broke up into different factions, represented by Anniceris, Hegesias, and Theodorus, who all developed rival interpretations of Cyrenaic doctrines, many of which were responses to the new system of hedonistic philosophy laid down by Epicurus. By the middle of the 3rd century BC, the Cyrenaic school was obsolete; Epicureanism had successfully beaten its Cyrenaic rivals by offering a system which was more sophisticated.\nThe Cyrenaics were hedonists and held that pleasure was the supreme good in life, especially physical pleasure, which they thought more intense and more desirable than mental pleasures. Pleasure is the only good in life and pain is the only evil. Socrates had held that virtue was the only human good, but he had also accepted a limited role for its utilitarian side, allowing pleasure to be a secondary goal of moral action. Aristippus and his followers seized upon this, and made pleasure the sole final goal of life, denying that virtue had any intrinsic value.\nThe Cyrenaics were known for their skeptical theory of knowledge. They reduced logic to a basic doctrine concerning the criterion of truth. They thought that we can know with certainty our immediate sense-experiences (for instance, that I am having a sweet sensation now) but can know nothing about the nature of the objects that cause these sensations (for instance, that the honey is sweet). They also denied that we can have knowledge of what the experiences of other people are like.\nAll knowledge is of one\'s own immediate sensation. These sensations are motions which are purely subjective, and are painful, indifferent or pleasant, according as they are violent, tranquil or gentle. Further they are entirely individual, and can in no way be described as being of the world objectively. Feeling, therefore, is the only possible criterion of knowledge and of conduct. Our ways of being affected are alone knowable. Thus the sole aim for everyone should be pleasure.\nCyrenaicism deduces a single, universal aim for all people which is pleasure. Furthermore, all feeling is momentary and homogeneous. It follows that past and future pleasure have no real existence for us, and that among present pleasures there is no distinction of kind. Socrates had spoken of the higher pleasures of the intellect; the Cyrenaics denied the validity of this distinction and said that bodily pleasures, being more simple and more intense, were preferable. Momentary pleasure, preferably of a physical kind, is the only good for humans.\nHowever some actions which give immediate pleasure can create more than their equivalent of pain. The wise person should be in control of pleasures rather than be enslaved to them, otherwise pain will result, and this requires judgement to evaluate the different pleasures of life. Regard should be paid to law and custom, because even though these things have no intrinsic value on their own, violating them will lead to unpleasant penalties being imposed by others. Likewise, friendship and justice are useful because of the pleasure they provide. Thus the Cyrenaics believed in the hedonistic value of social obligation and altruistic behavior. Like many of the leading modern utilitarians, they combined with their psychological distrust of popular judgments of right and wrong, and their firm conviction that all such distinctions are based solely on law and convention, the equally unwavering principle that the wise person who would pursue pleasure logically must abstain from that which is usually thought wrong or unjust. This idea, which occupies a prominent position in systems like those of Jeremy Bentham, Volney, and even William Paley, was clearly of prime importance to the Cyrenaics.\nThe later Cyrenaics, Anniceris, Hegesias, and Theodorus, all developed variations on the standard Cyrenaic doctrine. For Anniceris, pleasure is achieved through individual acts of gratification which are sought for the pleasure that they produce, but Anniceris laid great emphasis on the love of family, country, friendship and gratitude, which provide pleasure even when they demand sacrifice. Hegesias believed that happiness is impossible to achieve, and hence the goal of life becomes the avoidance of pain and sorrow. Conventional values such as wealth, poverty, freedom, and slavery are all indifferent and produce no more pleasure than pain. For Hegesias, Cyrenaic hedonism was simply the least irrational strategy for dealing with the pains of life. For Theodorus, the goal of life is mental pleasure not bodily pleasure, and he placed greater emphasis on the need for moderation and justice. He was also famous for being an atheist. To some extent these philosophers were all trying to meet the challenge laid down by Epicureanism, and the success of Epicurus was in developing a system of philosophy which would prove to be more comprehensive and sophisticated than its rivals.\n- Annas 1995, p. 229\n- Diogenes Laërtius, ii. 84f\n- Aristocles ap.

He taught that pleasure and pain are the measures of what is good and evil; death is the end of both body and soul and should therefore not be feared; the gods neither reward nor punish humans; the universe is infinite and eternal; and events in the world are ultimately based on the motions and interactions of atoms. Although much of Epicurus\'written work has been lost, the remaining principle doctrines and his letters featured in this book provide an insight into the Epicurean school of thought, which was originally based in the garden of his house and thus called The Garden.\nPrincipal Doctrines and Letter to Menoeceus Epicurus Translated by Robert Drew Hicks Epicurus (341-270 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher as well as the founder of the school of philosophy called Epicureanism. Only a few fragments and letters of Epicurus\'s 300 written works remain. Much of what is known about Epicurean philosophy derives from later followers and commentators.For Epicurus, the purpose of philosophy was to attain the happy, tranquil life, characterized by ataraxia-peace and freedom from fear-and aponia-the absence of pain-and by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends. He taught that pleasure and pain are the measures of what is good and evil; death is the end of both body and soul and should therefore not be feared; the gods neither reward nor punish humans; the universe is infinite and eternal; and events in the world are ultimately based on the motions and interactions of atoms moving in empty space.His parents, Neocles and Chaerestrate, both Athenian-born, and his father a citizen, had emigrated to the Athenian settlement on the Aegean island of Samos about ten years before Epicurus\'s birth in February 341 BC. As a boy, he studied philosophy for four years under the Platonist teacher Pamphilus. At the age of 18, he went to Athens for his two-year term of military service. The playwright Menander served in the same age-class of the ephebes as Epicurus.\n""No one is too young or too old to know what happiness is.""This is how the way to happiness begins according to Epicurus, the famous founder of one of the most important schools of thought of the Hellenistic and Roman age. Happiness, which individuals yearn so much for, becomes something really easy to get. In this ""Letter on happiness"" Epicurus reflects on the real meaning of happiness and then reveals you how you can achieve it .

Epicurus is a key figure in the development of science and scientific methodology because of his insistence that nothing should be believed, except that which was tested through direct observation and logical deduction. He was a key figure in the Axial Age, the period from 800 BC to 200 BC, during which, according to Karl Jaspers, similar thinking appeared in China, India, Iran, the Near East, and Ancient Greece. His statement of the Ethic of Reciprocity as the foundation of ethics is the earliest in Ancient Greece, and he differs from the formulation of utilitarianism by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill by emphasizing the minimization of harm to oneself and others as the way to maximize happiness.\nAuthor: Jeffrey Fish\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press\nRelease Date: 2011-05-26\nBrings together the work of leading classicists and philosophers in order to show the vitality and development of Epicureanism after Epicurus, and especially the dynamic interplay between tradition and innovation.\nThe idea that happiness is a choice accessible to all is far from new; the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus developed the Natural Philosophy of life over two thousand years ago, providing practical, contemporary guidelines to finding meaning and happiness. Unlike Plato, who valued the divine logic above all, Epicurus argued that the pursuit of ideals produced by logic alone leads to inner conflict, cognitive dissonance, dissatisfaction, and even depression. He suggested that by first embracing our natural desires, then using logic to determine which choices will increase pleasure over time, and using our will to take action, we could learn and change, and achieve happiness.

59	climate trends prediction accuracy long term vs daily weather forecast southeast usa	While day-to-day weather remains unpredictable, researchers have a better understanding of long-term climate trends. They can predict with some comfort level what will happen three to four months ahead, such as whether conditions will be drier than normal, wetter than normal, or hotter than normal. However, they cannot predict specific daily weather patterns.	['Adapting to unpredictable weather is part of Lamar Black’s job as a farmer in Jenkins County, Ga.\nBlack grows cotton, corn and peanuts on more than 400 acres, so each year he plans for and adjusts to extreme temperatures and rain, or lack thereof.\n“We are in a changing climate, for whatever reason,” Black said. “It appears that we’re not getting the rainfall in the winter that we used to get.\n“We used to get a lot of rain in the wintertime. The last few years it hasn’t been. The summers seem to be hotter.”\nDrought tops the list\nThe surge in temperatures from June until August is made worse by the drought-like conditions much of the state of Georgia is suffering through.\n“The drought has been the biggest concern,” Black said. “Back in ’11 it was extremely dry. Who knows what’s going to happen this year. We’re all hoping for the best.”\nFortunately for Black, technological advances allow farmers to combat that unpredictability. Such advances include sensor-based irrigation management (sensors in the field that help farmers deliver scheduled irrigation optimally), subsurface drip irrigation (a method of watering crops underground that requires less water than other irrigation systems and allows the soil surface to stay dry, reducing weeds) and AgroClimate (a Web-based system that helps producers plan for upcoming seasons using the best available forecasts about what the climate will do in the next few months).\n“I think it’s really critical, especially when we’re in periods of drought to be able to look at technologies and implement them so that producers can have the yields that they’re accustomed to,” said George Vellidis, University of Georgia College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences professor on the Tifton campus.\nUGA researchers addressing climate trends\nVellidis was one of the presenters at the Climate Adaptation Exchange event in Tifton on Feb. 8. The event featured management strategies like variable-rate irrigation, primed acclimation, sod-based rotation, conservation tillage and high-residue cover crops and energy efficiency alternatives.\n“I think weather is unpredictable,” Vellidis added. “I think we have a better grasp on what long-term climate trends will be. For example, three months ahead or four months ahead, I think we know now, to some level of comfort, we are going to be able to say what’s going to happen. We can say it’s going to be drier than normal, wetter than normal, hotter than normal and so on.\n“We can’t predict day to day … but we can understand the trends.”\nThe trend during the past couple of weeks has been a steady dose of rainfall in parts of the Southeast.\n“We’re in a really wet pattern right now,” said Pam Knox, a CAES agricultural climatologist, referencing weather maps at the Climate Adaptation Exchange event. “They still have that area of above-normal rainfall continuing for the next couple of weeks. That’s good if you want the water in the soil but maybe not so good if you’re trying to get out in the fields. Just like everything else, it’s a mixed blessing.” However, farmers’ spirits could soon be dampened by the prospect of drier conditions in the upcoming months.\nAgroclimate website is one tool in toolbox\nAgroClimate, which features seasonal forecasts, predicts a much-drier pattern across the southern part of the country during the upcoming months, through April.\nAs the drought lingers for Black and his fellow farmers, there are innovative options for producers to use. Chuck Von Glahn teamed with Vellidis to discuss sensor-based irrigation management. It’s one strategy Von Glahn has worked with while farming in Mitchell County, Ga.\n“I would say as a farmer, it is a bit of a challenge with utilizing different resources to try to save here and there,” Von Glahn said. “With irrigation management, the way that we plant, strip-till, that kind of thing, it’s allowed us to venture into different areas to conserve.”\nFor more information about AgroClimate, view the program’s Website at www.agroclimate.org.\n(Clint Thompson is a news editor with the University of Georgia College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences based in Tifton.)\nCalvin Perry, superintendent at the University of Georgia Stripling Irrigation Research Park, gives a presentation on variable-rate irrigation at the Climate Adaptation Exchange event held Feb. 8 in Tifton, Ga.Download Image\nGeorge Vellidis, a University of Georgia professor, discusses the use of sensors in irrigation during the Climate Adaptation Exchange event held Feb. 8 on the UGA campus in Tifton, Ga.Download Image']	['<urn:uuid:9a860d05-1384-439b-afcc-71e8554b44f9>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	12	53	737
60	In my work with computer vision systems, I'm curious about the methods used to find corresponding points between overlapping images - what techniques are used to handle this in modern photogrammetry?	Tie points between overlapping images can be found using either targets (which may be coded to define point numbers) or natural features. For natural features, operators like SIFT, SURF or ORB provide robust feature detection and matching. However, reliable matching requires large relative image overlap (e.g. 90% from image to image), and matching becomes weak or impossible in areas without sufficient textures.	['Recent Developments in Close-range Photogrammetry - 14/02/2019\nA Measurement Technology in Transition\nDramatic advances in automatic digital image analysis have opened up new applications and made photogrammetry applicable for a broader field of users that lack specific knowledge of photogrammetry. Megatrends such as Industry 4.0, building information modelling (BIM) and the digital transformation are driving the advancement of 3D measurement technologies, both in terms of high-end systems and low-cost sensors. New technical challenges such as autonomous driving or unmanned aerial vehicles are demanding innovative sensor systems, but also extended maps and models of the environment. Modern approaches such as structure from motion (SfM), simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) or visual odometry are now being combined with classical photogrammetric methods. This article addresses these and other recent developments in close-range photogrammetry.\nNew technical challenges such as autonomous driving or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or ‘drones’) are demanding innovative (hybrid) sensor systems, There is a huge range of image-recording devices available for close-range photogrammetry purposes (see Figure 1 for a few examples). Typical sensors can be roughly classified as follows:\n- Action and fisheye cameras\n- Cameras for the consumer market\n- Cameras for professional applications\n- Industrial cameras\n- Metric cameras for explicit photogrammetric applications\n- High-speed cameras\n- Panoramic cameras\n- Multi-camera systems\nPractically all modern imaging sensors are designed based on CMOS technology. Their availability ranges from mass products, e.g. smartphone cameras (usually with a rolling shutter), to specific high-performance sensors used for special applications such as high-speed imaging. Sensors with a global shutter are required for most dynamic applications where the camera or object are moving with respect to each other.\nHybrid sensor systems\nAn increasing number of hybrid systems are available in which camera sensors are combined with additional measuring devices. The most popular examples are terrestrial laser scanners equipped with one or more cameras for the acquisition of panorama images or for recording colour values for each point of a laser scan. As an example, the Leica BLK 360 scanner (Fig. 2a) consists of an additional thermal camera that can measure temperatures. The new Leica RTC 360 scanner (Fig. 2b) consists of five cameras that are used for visual odometry in a SLAM approach in order to measure the way and pose when the scanner is moved to the next station. Other examples of hybrid systems are low-cost sensors running on tablets or mobile devices that combine IMU, GNSS, time-of-flight (ToF), laser triangulation or RGB cameras for low-to-medium-accuracy 3D scanning. Fig. 2c shows a handheld tablet device based on a ToF sensor.\nAlmost every kind of camera can be used for photogrammetry as long as the interior orientation (camera parameters) can be calibrated. In particular, the functional model for modelling lens distortion and other imaging errors must be chosen appropriately to the specific camera. Depending on the stability and reproducibility of the camera geometry, it can be calibrated prior to or after a measurement if there is no ability for self-calibration on the job. Examples are measuring systems with a fixed arrangement of cameras in a housing. Examples of highly stable metric cameras are given in Fig. 1c and Fig. 1f. Artificial test fields are usually applied here for pre-calibration which should have a three-dimensional distribution of targets to provide a reliable and full calibration of the camera with minimum correlations to exterior orientations. For a large number of applications, the camera can be calibrated simultaneously with 3D object reconstruction by bundle adjustment. In this case, the camera is calibrated for the time of object recording, hence without any assumption of validity of previous calibration parameters. This approach is included in standard photogrammetric offline systems, e.g. SfM.\nMeasurement of tie points\nMulti-image photogrammetry requires overlapping images which are connected by corresponding points (homologous or tie points). By means of targets, which may be coded to define a certain point number, the process of finding correspondences and approximations for orientation is relatively easy. Using natural features as tie points, certain detectors and descriptors allow for the matching of similar features using different criteria. As examples, operators like SIFT, SURF or ORB provide robust feature detection and matching. However, for a reliable match it is recommended to acquire the images with a large relative overlap, e.g. 90% from image to image. Matching becomes weak or even impossible if large object areas are imaged without sufficient textures.\nThe calculation of the exterior orientations of all images (also called alignment) is a prerequisite for subsequent 3D object reconstruction. Basically, the process starts with a complex procedure for finding approximate values of all unknown parameters by a clever combination of relative and absolute orientations, space resections and intersections. The final optimization of all parameters is done by bundle adjustment which minimizes the residuals of all observations (image measurements) in one process in order to determine the desired calibration and orientation parameters, and the 3D coordinates of all tie points. If control points are available, they are integrated to define the final coordinate system and to compensate for the datum defect of a photogrammetric network. The 3D coordinates of all measured points provide a sparse point cloud of the object surface.\nBundle adjustment is the critical part in a photogrammetric orientation process. Hence, statistical quality parameters (sigma values, RMS of object points) shall be analysed carefully to provide a picture of the internal precision of the adjustment. However, the real accuracy must be checked by independent reference values (see below).\nSfM and SLAM\nBasically, the structure-from-motion approach is a complex procedure where subsequent images with high overlap are oriented automatically by means of feature detection, feature matching and robust sequential orientation. Based on RANSAC-based procedures and linear estimation models, datasets with a high number of outliers can be processed sufficiently.\nSimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approaches are often used in dynamic environments (e.g. moving robots) to measure the route (pose) of the sensor and the unknown environment simultaneously. Image-based SLAM algorithms are also called ‘visual odometry’. Since the geometric configuration of image sequences is often weak, additional sensors (e.g. IMU) and Kalman filtering are included.\nDense point clouds\nAfter successful bundle adjustment, a dense point cloud of the object surface can be calculated, if necessary. The objective is to derive 3D coordinates for every pixel (or in a specific resolution in object space). Today, the most successful approaches are based on semi-global matching (SGM) which looks for best matches along epipolar lines by minimizing a particular cost function. SGM is a robust method that can interpolate textureless areas and create surface models that sufficiently preserve sharp edges in object space. Compared to the orientation process above, the generation of dense point clouds requires much higher computational effort.\nEven in close-range photogrammetry, the generation of (true) orthophotos has become an important product, especially for UAV applications or in architectural and archaeological projects. Since the process described above generates orientation parameters and a dense surface model, orthophotos can be derived directly from the acquired images. However, a photogrammetric point cloud usually describes the visible surface of the object, i.e. with vegetation or other disturbing objects included. Before a final true orthophoto can be produced, the surface model may be subject to (manual) cleaning, filtering or other types of post-processing.\nIn many applications, further processing of point clouds is required, e.g. for the production of architectural plans or 3D models for BIM or facility management. Although a number of semi-automated software approaches are available for the extraction of certain elements (e.g. planes, pipes), the generation of final products often requires manual processing. This holds true for any kind of point clouds, i.e. also from laser scanning or other technologies.\nSemantic modelling, i.e. automatic classification of object parts, is still an ongoing research task that must involve human knowledge of the object and the application. Recent machine learning approaches demonstrate promising solutions to solve at least a part of the modelling interpretation process.\nAccuracy and verification\nProfessional use of photogrammetry usually involves specifications for high-quality results. In industrial applications, the verification of the achieved accuracy with respect to accepted guidelines is most important. In most cases, standardized characteristics such as the maximum length measurement error have to be reported including retraceability to the standard unit metre, e.g. by measurement of calibrated reference artefacts. In non-industrial fields, e.g. cultural heritage or topographic surveying, the comparison of independent control points is a well-established method to derive accuracy figures. However, these points should not be included into orientation processes but should be measured individually in order to represent subsequent processes such as dense matching.\nExample: Robot-based industrial inspection\nIndustry 4.0 is characterized by a number of significant changes in production, e.g. higher degree of individual products, shorter life cycles or more flexible manufacturing lines. For the past two decades photogrammetry has been successfully used in high-precision industrial metrology, e.g. in fields like inspection of tooling jigs by offline photogrammetry. Other examples include image-guided manual probing for measuring single 3D points with a touch probe, or fringe projection systems used as a standard tool for free-form surfaces.\nA new direction of online systems uses robots to drive a surface sensor to specific areas of an object. Since the mechanical positioning accuracy of a robot is not high enough to provide the exterior orientation (pose) of the scanning device directly, a camera system observes the actual position of the sensor with respect to a pre-calibrated field of targets. This concept provides high flexibility to adapt for specific measurement conditions. Hence, it allows the integration of optical 3D measurement devices into flexible production lines.\nFigure 3a shows a system in which a set of ceiling-mounted cameras measures the 6DOF pose of a fringe projection system. Figure 3b illustrates a robot-based system in which a camera is attached to the surface sensor which permanently measures a set of reference targets.\nExample: UAV photogrammetry\nUAV-based photogrammetry has become a standard measuring technology now that remotely piloted drones with high capabilities for autonomous flying are available. With the relevant flight permissions, UAVs can be used as imaging platforms for a wide area of applications, e.g. road mapping, observation of construction sites, archaeological surveys, topographic mapping, environmental monitoring, etc. In most cases, recorded images are processed by SfM software that automatically generates point clouds or orthophotos.\nSince many users have only limited photogrammetry skills, they do not always properly understand the impact of image configurations, distribution of control points or camera calibration issues. Consequently, the quality of results not only varies from project to project, but can also vary within a certain area of measurement within a project.\nThe professional use of UAV photogrammetry usually requires a high-quality camera/lens system, camera stabilization, dense image overlaps, sufficient intersection angles and a suitable distribution of control points, just as with aerial photogrammetry. Camera calibration can be particularly difficult when using non-professional cameras and/or weak flight configurations.\nFigure 4 shows an example of the use of an amateur drone (DJI Mavic Pro) for recording the roof areas of an ancient church. Although the drone was guided manually and the camera is not designed for measurements, configuring flights at different heights and the additional circular arrangement of images enabled the simultaneous calibration of the camera. Together with additional terrestrial images taken with a 24MP DSLR camera, a consistent and accurate 3D model with an average accuracy of 0.6 pixels (GSD between 5-10mm) could be generated by an SfM approach (RealityCapture).\nExample: Underwater weld measurement\nIn this example of measuring welding seams of underwater steel constructions, the objective is to measure the surface of welds with an accuracy and a resolution of about 30µm in a distance of about 50mm. Two variants of a prototype system have been developed. One solution consists of a laser line projector and two cameras that observe the projected laser line for stereo matching. The second version uses one or two cameras that are moved across a reference field with control points in order to derive the exterior orientations. The surface within overlapping areas is reconstructed by photogrammetric image matching.\nRecent trends and developments from photogrammetry and computer vision indicate a continuous change of classical measurement technologies which could be classified as a paradigm shift. A wide area of new applications is now addressed, leading to new prospects and challenges. However, whilst new automated imaging technologies increasingly cover dynamic scene recordings, the proper use of these methods by users with limited skills may lead to unsafe or unforeseen results. Hence, appropriate teaching concepts for students as well as life-long learning offers for practitioners are urgently required.\nFryer, J.G., Mitchell, H.L., Chandler, J.H.

61	how long breast implant operation takes	Breast implant surgery typically takes between 60 and 90 minutes to complete, depending on the procedure.	"[""Cosmetic or aesthetic surgery is a type of surgery used to change a person’s appearance to achieve what they perceive to be a more desirable look.\nIn certain situations cosmetic surgery may be needed for functional reasons. For example, breast reduction is sometimes used to alleviate back or neck pain.\nCosmetic surgery is different to reconstructive plastic surgery, which is a type of surgery used to repair damaged tissue following injury or illness.\nHaving cosmetic surgery is a major decision. It can be expensive, time consuming and the results can't be guaranteed.\nSometimes, people feel that having cosmetic surgery will help to solve a problem in their life and will make their life better.\nIt's important to ask yourself why you want to have cosmetic surgery. It's a good idea to discuss your plans with your doctor before going ahead with treatment. If you decide to have surgery, be absolutely sure about your reasons for wanting to have it.\nCosmetic surgery is rarely available through the NHS. There must be a major physical or psychological reason for needing the surgery.\nIn rare cases, a clinical commissioning group (CCG) may decide that cosmetic surgery is required to improve a person's health, although NHS resources are limited and waiting times are usually long. For this reason, most people pay to have cosmetic surgery privately.\nRead more about the availability of cosmetic surgery.\nIf you decide to have cosmetic surgery, it's important that the surgeon and other healthcare professionals carrying out the procedure are fully qualified and experienced in the type of procedure you're having.\nYou should discuss the procedure in detail with your surgeon. Ask as many questions as you need to so that you're fully aware of what the procedure involves, how it will be carried out, what the results will be and whether there will be any after effects.\nThere are many different types of cosmetic surgery procedure. Some of the most common include:\nRead more about common cosmetic surgery procedures.\nA popular alternative to cosmetic surgery are non-surgical cosmetic procedures. These can change a person’s appearance using things like injections and lasers.\nCommon non-surgical procedures include:\nHowever, there is little regulation of these procedures and many don't require the person performing them to have any medical qualifications.\nRead more about common non-surgical cosmetic procedures.\nAs with all types of surgery, cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong and the results may not be what you expected.\nIf you've had cosmetic surgery and you're not happy with the results, or you think that the procedure wasn't carried out properly, take up the matter with your surgeon through the hospital or clinic that referred you.\nIf you wish to take the matter further, you can contact the Care Quality Commission (CQC). The CQC is a regulatory body that all hospitals and clinics providing cosmetic surgery must be registered with.\nPractitioners of non-surgical procedures do not currently need to be registered with the CQC or any other regulatory body, so if you have an issue it's best to take it up with the person who carried out the procedure or the clinic where it was performed.\nThere are many different types of cosmetic surgery procedure and it's important to find out as much as possible about any procedure you're considering.\nInformation about the following common surgical procedures can be found below:\nYou can also read about the general risks of cosmetic surgery.\nBreast augmentation or enlargement is a procedure used to increase breast size with implants. It's the most common cosmetic procedure carried out in the UK.\nBreast implant surgery is usually performed under general anaesthetic. This means you will be asleep and unable to feel any pain or discomfort during the procedure.\nThe procedure starts with your surgeon making an incision (surgical cut). Your surgeon will discuss with you the exact location of the incision before the procedure. It will depend on the shape and size of your breasts and where you would like the scars to be.\nAfter the incision has been made, the implants can be fitted. The implant can either be positioned between your breast tissue and your chest muscle or behind your chest muscle. In some cases, the surgeon is able to place the implant partly behind the breast and partly behind the muscle. Your surgeon will be able to offer advice about the position that is best for you.\nOnce the implants are in place, the incisions are sealed using stitches, which will usually be covered with a dressing.\nBreast implant surgery is sometimes carried out as day surgery, which means you will be able to go home the same day. However, if the operation is scheduled late in the day, you may need to stay in hospital overnight. Depending on the procedure you are having, the operation should take between 60 and 90 minutes.\nIf the stitches used aren't dissolvable, they will be removed after seven to 14 days. Some surgeons recommend wearing a tight-fitting sports bra 24 hours a day for up to three months following breast surgery.\nMost breast implants last about 10-15 years, after which time further surgery may be needed to replace them.\nAs well as the general risks of surgery (see below), risks of having breast implants include:\nYou should contact your surgeon or doctor if you are concerned about your implants. Further surgery may be needed to replace it if there's a problem.\nRead more about the risks of breast implants and PIP breast implants.\nFemale breast reduction is an operation to reduce the weight and volume of a woman's breasts. It's usually done under general anaesthetic.\nMost breast reduction surgery begins with the nipple, which is moved to its new position, usually while still attached to the blood supply. If you have extremely large breasts, the nipples may be removed and repositioned as a skin graft.\nExcess skin and breast tissue are then removed. The remaining breast tissue is reshaped to create smaller and more elevated breasts.\nThe procedure takes between two and four hours. You are usually required to stay in hospital for one or two nights. The stitches will normally be removed between 10 to 14 days after the operation.\nAs well as the general risks of surgery (see below), risks of female breast reduction include:\nRead more about the risks of female breast reduction.\nMale breast reduction is used to reduce the size of enlarged male breasts (known as gynaecomastia) if lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly, haven't helped.\nThe procedure is usually carried out using a general anaesthetic.\nDuring the operation, the surgeon makes an incision around the nipple and excess fatty tissue is sucked out. If there is a lot of tissue to remove, cuts may extend down the chest and the nipples may need to be repositioned.\nThe operation usually takes about 90 minutes. You will be required to stay in hospital overnight.\nIf non-dissolvable stitches are used, these will need to be removed after seven to 14 days. An elastic garment also needs to be worn for one to four weeks after the operation to encourage your skin to heal properly around the affected area.\nAs well as the general risks of surgery (see below), risks of male breast reduction include:\nEar reshaping surgery, also known as otoplasty or pinnaplasty, is used to improve the appearance of the ears and make them as symmetrical as possible.\nSurgery involving older children and adults can be carried out under local anaesthetic. This means the affected area is numbed. Younger children may need a general anaesthetic.\nDuring surgery, a small cut is made behind the ear to expose the ear cartilage. The cartilage is repositioned and shaped by removing small pieces, then scoring and stitching the remaining structure into the desired shape and position.\nThe length of time it takes depends on the complexity of each case. However, the procedure generally takes one to two hours. If local anaesthetic is used, you will usually be able to go home the same day. An overnight stay in hospital may be required if general anaesthetic is used.\nThe stitches are removed five to 10 days after surgery and you will need to wear a head bandage during this time to support the ears in their new position.\nAs well as the general risks of surgery (see below), risks of ear reshaping surgery include:\nRead more about the risks of ear reshaping surgery.\nEyelid surgery, also known as blepharoplasty, is used to remove excess skin from the upper and lower eyelids to get rid of hooded eyelids or eye bags.\nBoth upper and lower eyelid surgery can be carried out under local anaesthetic or general anaesthetic. General anaesthetic is often preferred if both the upper eyelids and lower eyelids are being corrected.\nDuring surgery on the upper eyelids, the surgeon makes an incision along the eyelid crease in the natural skin fold of the eyelid and removes unwanted skin, fat and muscle. The surgeon then closes up the incision, which will hide the scar in the natural fold of the eyelid.\nDuring surgery on the lower eyelids, the surgeon moves or removes fat from the bags under the eyes either through an incision made just below the lower lashes or an incision made on the inside of the eyelid. A small amount of skin may also be removed, but the muscle that closes the eyelid is preserved.\nCosmetic eyelid surgery takes between one and two hours. If local anaesthetic is used, you can usually go home the same day as the operation. If general anaesthetic is used, you will need to stay in hospital until the effects wear off.\nThe surgeon will normally apply suture strips to support the eyelids after surgery, these are usually removed after three to five days.\nAs well as the general risks of surgery (see below), risks of eyelid surgery include:\nThe British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) has more information on eyelid surgery.\nA rhytidectomy, or 'facelift', is a procedure used to reduce flabby or sagging skin around the face and neck. The procedure is usually carried out under general anaesthetic.\nThere are many different kinds of facelift, but generally incisions are made above the hair line at the temples, extending under and behind the ear and into the hairline. The skin is then pulled backwards and upwards before being stitched into its new position.\nAt the end of the operation, the surgeon closes up the incisions with stitches and applies a dressing to protect the area where the incisions were made\nThe procedure can take up to six hours to complete and an overnight stay in hospital is usually required.\nMost surgeons will bandage the face to minimise bruising and swelling. These bandages will stay on for one or two days and the stitches are removed after seven to eight days.\nAs well as the general risks of surgery (see below), risks of facelifts include:\nThe British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) has more information on facelifts.\nLiposuction is used to remove unwanted body fat.\nMost liposuction operations are performed under general anaesthetic. For treatments on the lower parts of the body, an epidural anaesthetic may be used. This numbs the lower part of the body while you are awake.\nThe surgeon usually begins the operation by injecting a liquid solution into the area being treated. This fluid helps to reduce the risk of problems like bruising and bleeding.\nThe surgeon then makes a small cut in the skin. If the area being treated is large, several cuts may have to be made.\nA suction tube attached to a specialist vacuum machine, is then inserted into the cut. This loosens the fat in the area being treated and then sucks it out.\nThis procedure usually lasts between one and four hours. You will have to stay in hospital overnight if general anaesthetic is used.\nAfter the procedure you will be fitted with an elasticated corset or bandages for the treated area. This helps to reduce swelling and bruising, and it should be worn for several weeks after the operation. The stitches will usually be removed after about seven days.\nAs well as the general risks of surgery (see below), risks of liposuction include:\nRead more about the risks of liposuction.\nA rhinoplasty, or 'nose job', is a procedure used to reshape the nose.\nThere are a number of different types of nose reshaping operation. The exact procedure will depend on the aim of the treatment. The operation may take place under a general or local anaesthetic.\nThe two main techniques used are called 'open' or 'closed'. Open means that some or all of the cuts are made outside the nose, whereas closed means all the cuts are made inside the nose.\nA nose reshaping operation normally involves separating the soft tissue that lies on top of the nose from the bone and cartilage underneath. Depending on the operation, the surgeon might break the nose bone and reposition it, and/or reshape the cartilage.\nNose reshaping surgery generally takes around two hours.\nAfter the operation, it's likely you will need to wear a protective splint over your nose for a few weeks. Stitches inside your nose will probably be dissolvable and will not need to be removed. Your surgeon will advise you about when any stitches outside your nose need to be removed.\nAs well as the general risks of surgery (see below), risks of nose jobs include:\nThe British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) has more information on nose reduction and nose augmentation.\nAn abdominoplasty, or 'tummy tuck', is a procedure used to alter the shape of the abdomen (tummy area) by removing fat and excess loose skin, usually if lifestyle changes like healthy eating and dieting are unsuccessful.\nThere are two types of tummy tuck, called 'partial' and 'full'. These operations will usually be carried out under a general anaesthetic.\nIn a partial tummy tuck, the surgeon makes a large incision across the lower abdomen. They then separate the skin from the abdominal wall, remove excess fat and cut away the excess skin. The remaining skin is then pulled together and stitched.\nFor a full tummy tuck, the surgeon makes an incision across the lower abdomen, just above the pubic area. They then make a second incision to free the belly button from the tissue that surrounds it and they separate the skin from the abdominal wall.\nThe surgeon then pulls down the abdominal muscles and stitches them into their new position, removes fat deposits and cuts away the excess skin. A new hole is cut for the belly button, and it is stitched back into place. Finally, the surgeon pulls the remaining skin down and stitches it together.\nThe length of the operation will depend on the extent of the surgery, but it could take up to three hours.\nAfter the procedure, you will need to stay in hospital overnight. The stitches will be removed after seven to 14 days and you will need to wear a supporting corset for one to four weeks to encourage your skin to heal properly around the affected area.\nAs well as the general risks of surgery (see below), risks of tummy tucks include:\nThe British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) has more information on abdominal reduction.\nAs with any type of surgery, cosmetic surgery has associated risks and complications. The degree of risk depends on whether the surgery is in a small or large area, the level of experience of the surgeon and the overall health of the person having the procedure.\nGeneral complications from cosmetic surgery can include:\nThere is also a risk that your expectations of surgery do not match what is realistically achievable, so it's important to discuss these issues in detail with your surgeon before giving your consent to surgery.\nYou should have follow-up appointments after surgery so your recovery can be monitored.\nIf you have any concerns regarding your recovery from a surgical procedure, such as pain, swelling, discharge or any other unexpected side effects, speak to your surgeon, doctor or healthcare team immediately.\nAll private companies that provide cosmetic surgery must register with the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Always ask to see the company’s registration before agreeing to have cosmetic surgery at a private hospital or clinic.\nThe CQC inspects all cosmetic surgery providers and reports on their findings.\nThe cost of private cosmetic treatment can vary depending on where you have treatment and the type of procedure being carried out.\nImportant: Our website provides useful information but is not a substitute for medical advice.

Students also complete 120 hours of commercial internships to gain real-world industry experience.	['Author: Jim Beaugez\nThis article by Jim Beaugez explores how higher education has stepped up to support those who want to pursue careers in the esports industry, which is now a billion-dollar business and expected for even more future growth.\nEmpower your students to achieve their dreams with high-speed CONNECTION.\nParents who said playing video games was a waste of time may have been wrong. Esports, the industry that has sprung up behind competitive gaming, is now a billion-dollar business, and it’s expected to nearly double in size over the next two years.\nGaming has grown exponentially since the arcade days of the 1970s and 1980s, and even since the gaming console wars from the 1990s. The availability of broadband internet has enabled real-time interactions among gamers both locally and around the world. Today, a gamer may be sitting in a dorm room in Ithaca, NY, but their opponents could be anywhere.\n[Higher Ed Esports Programs Need Support from AV/IT Experts]\nAs the esports market has matured, higher education has stepped up to support those who want to pursue careers in the esports industry. The National Association of Collegiate Esports, formed in 2016, counts more than 170 colleges and universities among its membership. These schools offer officially recognized varsity esports programs, complete with coaches and partial or full-ride athletic scholarships.\nDemand for esports has never been higher at the University of Akron in Ohio, where its esports program has notched 15 national championships in the past four years.\n“When we started to build the program out on campus, we thought maybe we would target the varsity population for students to participate at the high-level competitions,” said Nathan Meeker, director of esports at the university. “But that quickly expanded out to the club and recreational scenes on campus, because there was such a demand for it from the student body.”\nIn response, the University of Akron built three gaming spaces on campus totaling 6,000 square feet that serve 2,500 students each semester, many of whom compete on one of 70-plus club teams. Network connectivity in the spaces with low latency was a high priority because online gaming requires real-time reactions from players, who typically see symmetrical download and upload speeds of 400-500 Mbps delivered by fiber—well above the average U.S. home internet connection of 42 Mbps.\n“We also recognized that going through the university’s traditional firewalls may cause an issue with some of the games,” Meeker explained. “The three different spaces were set up with three different tunnels that go from our spaces directly to our exodus on campus, so we’re not dealing with as many issues as a traditional computer lab might deal with.”\n[UNC Chapel Hill Opens Esports Arena]\nThe university’s gaming pods are separated by geography and use. Up to 32 students can play simultaneously in the varsity pod, located in the football stadium, while recreational spaces in the honors college and student union can host another 32 and 54 gamers, respectively, with one screen per gaming station and each station connected to a dedicated Ethernet port.\nGrowth from Discord\nThe esports program at the University of South Florida was the result of a student-led initiative that began in 2020 and grew rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the school’s Discord online gaming group became a hub of activity because students couldn’t meet in person. The business school added an esports class in 2021.\n“Since then, we’ve seen tremendous growth in our students, and the community around Tampa is looking to support esports holistically on a larger scale, and that’s what continues to drive it,” said Antonio Gonzalez, assistant director of sports programs at USF. “The student engagement, the community engagement and involvement—esports connects a lot of these different facets for these students.”\nWorking with the IT department on campus, Gonzalez and his colleagues designed the Esports Living Lab, which is scheduled to be completed by the Fall 2022 semester. “The esports program is predicated on what I like to call the three Cs: community, competition and career competencies,” Gonzalez explained. “When we were looking at designing the space, we wanted to [serve] each one of those pillars of our program within that space. And we think that we have a pretty good mesh of everything we’re able to do within 2,500 square feet.”\nIn the main area of the lab, students will be able to play at 43 gaming stations, while spectators watch on a total of 23 screens measuring up to 80 inches each. Just off the main room, a production studio will support up to three broadcasters and two analysts, as well as two production leaders who will control the broadcast feed sent to the Twitch streaming app. A separate competition room will have seven stations with cameras to record the players’ faces in addition to on-screen, POV perspectives.\nThe esports program at California State University, Dominguez Hills grew from a grassroots club of three students in 2017 to more than 200 students by 2019. But keeping up with that level of growth was difficult, and the group quickly outgrew its corner of the student union. Meanwhile, the school administration was taking notes and realized that esports represents much more than a fun social club—it’s a learning opportunity that could serve their students well beyond graduation.\n“When we talk about esports we usually hear esports arena,” said Ruben Caputo, who serves as IT consultant and the esports general manager for the campus. “This is a place to design and think, to ideate [and to] work collaboratively. It’s four pieces: incubation space, production space, competition space, and classroom.”\nTo serve those needs, Caputo and the CSUDH Esports Association began working with Amplified Design on a new gaming center located in the university library complex. Divided into an incubator space with six stations, a competition space with 12 stations, and a classroom for 24 students, the center required 48 ViewSonic screens, a QSC Q-sys control platform, and a CAT6 infrastructure.\nAccording to Mathew Pomeroy, vice president of design services at Amplified Design, the main challenge was working in a space where the video feed had to be as close to live as possible. Relying on Crestron NVX and NDI for video streaming and routing, the team was able to get latency down to just nine milliseconds.\n“We have two full 48 port switches that are full on the [Crestron] NVX front that carries into another switch,” Pomeroy said. “Between displays and video feeds and inputs, you’re looking probably over 100 video endpoints, whether they’re inputs or outputs between TV screens, displays or broadcast equipment. We have some quad processors in the mix so you can do some tiling and picture-in-picture.\n[Panasonic Helps Southwestern Oklahoma State Configure First-Ever Esports Arena]\n“Each of the competitive spaces are totally independent, so gamers can play without any interruption of the video signal,” Pomeroy added. “We take a feed off of the [PC] tower, so that way we can run video signal from the gaming station anywhere we want in the space, whether it goes to Twitch [or] whether it goes to a display at the back of the room.”\nFor a breakthrough industry and an academic discipline on the cusp of the mainstream, the potential for growth in esports, both professional and institutional, is big.\n“We’re trying to make sure we give our space room to expand,” said Gonzalez. “That’s one of the biggest things that I’ve worked on when looking at the space. With the resources that we have right now, we know that we may not get all of the bells and whistles we want. But if we can get room and opportunities for growth in the future, that’s going to help us continue to expand the programs.”\nThis article was written by Jim Beaugez from AV Network and was legally licensed through the Industry Dive Content Marketplace.

While olives provide numerous health benefits including antioxidant properties, vitamin E, and polyphenols that protect against diseases, one disadvantage of natural compounds is their high production costs compared to chemically synthesized alternatives.	"['University of Vigo posted this:Procedure for the extraction of biosurfactants contained in corn steep liquorsNowadays, most of the pharmaceutical and cosmetic products in the market contain chemically synthesized surfactants in its composition. In many cases, these surfactants are the same as those used in regular cleanup activities. In order to get more natural and biocompatible products, it would be interesting to include natural surfactants instead of chemical surfactants in the preparation of these pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. These biosurfactants are also present in the formulation of greener nanoparticles, replacing the chemical surfactants currently used in the preparation thereof. Most biosurfactants have antimicrobial activity, which would improve the properties of certain nanoparticles, as well as many pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. The main disadvantage of biosurfactants industrial production is related to the high cost compared to chemically synthesized surfactant production. The solution proposed by the Chemical Engineering research group at the University of Vigo, is the development of eco-friendly simple extraction of biosurfactant from a corn wet-milling industry byproduct, such as corn wash liquors, better known as ""corn steep liquor (CSL)"", which could compete in terms of cost production with its chemical counterparts.\nConsejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas posted this:Antibodies to measure residual levels of mycotoxin ochratoxin A in foodCSIC and the University of Valencia have developed antibodies capable of determining ochratoxin A in food and ensure compliance with legislation on food products regarding the presence of this mycotoxin. Antibodies have been generated using novel functionalized derivatives of ochratoxin A. These immunoreagents have shown their efficacy in both direct and indirect competitive ELISA to detect concentrations close to parts per trillion. We are looking for companies interested in patent licensing for the development of fast, sensitive and portable kits for the analysis of ochratoxin A in foods and beverages based on these antibodies. The license of the patent is offered Effective, fast and accurate detection Ochratoxin A has a higher incidence in cereals, wine, juices and coffee One of the most harmful and frequent mycotoxins in food is ochratoxin A. Its presence is a real problem for human health due to its toxicity, and it causes significant economic losses to various productive sectors. The main fungi producing ochratoxin A belongs to the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus, and the products with the highest incidence are cereals, wine, juices and coffee. The small concentrations at which this potent toxin is usually found commonly require the use of sophisticated chromatographic methods. An alternative is the generation of antibodies against ochratoxin A with superior performance to the existing ones that allow this toxin being recognized with high affinity and specificity. These immunoreagents can be easily implemented in various analytical platforms, from the simplest, such as competitive ELISAs and immunochromatographic strips, to more complex, like chips or biosensors of different types, which allows us to simultaneously analyze a large number of samples in low-resource settings such as warehouses, cellars and even farmlands. Main applications and advantages Ochratoxin A derivatives functionalized at new positions have been synthesized that faithfully preserve the structure and characteristics of this potent mycotoxin. These new compounds have proven to be extremely efficient as haptens to generate antibodies capable of recognizing ochratoxin A with an affinity and selectivity not previously described. Immunoassays developed using these immunoreagents have been shown to be very sensitive, allowing analysis of ochratoxin A at levels close to 10 parts per trillion. These new methods are faster than instrumental procedures, especially when analyzing complex samples such as wine and coffee. The generated immunoreagents are easily adaptable to portable methods, such as ELISA kits or immunochromatographic strips.

Different studies have demonstrated the strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagenic and anticancer properties of GA, and daily intake may reduce the risk of diseases and bring health benefits. More recently, Gallic Acid has also been studied for its beneficial effects on cardiovascular diseases. It inhibits dyslipidemia, hepatosteatosis and oxidative stress in high-fat diet fed rats, protects the myocardium against isoproterenol-induced oxidative stress in rats, ameliorates the heart-function defects of myocardial dysfunction associated with streptozotocin-induced type-1 diabetic rats and exhibits anti-hyperglycemic and lipid-lowering properties in high-fat diet mice. Gallic Acid is commonly used as antioxidant by the food industry. However, until now, it is not known that the gallic acid could block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is the innovative aspect discover for the Nutrigenomic Group for the Gallic Acid. The inhibition of the RAAS by Gallic Acid is considered to be of special relevance because RAAS overactivity is currently associated with not only hypertension but also vascular inflammation, the development of atherosclerosis, left ventricular hypertrophy, nephrosclerosis and cardiovascular events.

They are native to the Mediterranean region and have been cultivated for thousands of years for their culinary and medicinal uses. Olives are typically small and oval-shaped, with a hard pit in the center. They range in color from green to black and can have a variety of flavors depending on their ripeness and how they are cured or prepared. Olives are commonly used in Mediterranean cuisine, including dishes such as salads, pizzas, and pasta sauces. They are also used to produce olive oil, which is a staple in many Mediterranean diets.\nNutritional Value of Olives\nOlives are nutrient-dense fruit that are rich in healthy fats, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. They are low in calories but high in fiber, which makes them a great addition to a healthy diet. One serving of olives (about 10 small olives or 1 ounce) provides approximately 50 calories, 4 grams of fat, 2 grams of fiber, and 1 gram of protein. Olives are a good source of vitamin E, iron, copper, and calcium, and they also contain polyphenols, which have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, olives are high in sodium due to their curing and brining process, so it’s important to consume them in moderation.\nHealth Benefits of Olives\nOlives have several health benefits due to their nutrient and antioxidant content. Here are some of the key health benefits of olives:\nOlives are a great source of monounsaturated fats which can reduce the levels of LDL cholesterol (the “bad” cholesterol) and lower the risk of heart disease. The antioxidants in olives also play a role in reducing the risk of heart disease by reducing inflammation and improving blood vessel function.\nOlives contain several compounds that have anti-inflammatory properties, including oleocanthal, which has been shown to have similar effects to ibuprofen in reducing inflammation. This can potentially reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as arthritis and cancer.\nOlives are a good source of fiber, which is important for maintaining digestive health and regularity. The fiber in olives can help prevent constipation and promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.\nOlives are rich in antioxidants, which help protect the body from damage caused by free radicals. This can potentially reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and cardiovascular disease.\nOlives are a good source of several nutrients that are important for bone health, including calcium and vitamin K. These nutrients play a role in maintaining strong bones and reducing the risk of osteoporosis.\nMay Help Lower the Risk of Certain Cancers\nThe antioxidants in olives have been shown to have anti-cancer properties. Studies suggest that regular consumption of olives may help reduce the risk of certain cancers, such as breast cancer and colon cancer.\nMay Help Improve Brain Function\nOlives contain several nutrients that are important for brain health, including vitamin E and polyphenols. These nutrients have been shown to help improve memory and cognitive function.\nCan Help Lower Blood Pressure\nOlives contain compounds that can help lower blood pressure. This can be beneficial for those with hypertension and may help reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.\nSupports Healthy Skin\nOlives contain vitamin E, which is an important nutrient for skin health. Vitamin E helps protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals and can help keep the skin looking youthful and healthy.\nProvides Nutrients for Overall Health and Well-being\nOlives are a nutrient-dense food that contains several important vitamins and minerals, including iron, copper, and vitamin A. Including olives in your diet can provide you with the nutrients your body needs for overall health and well-being.\nOverall, olives can be a nutritious addition to a healthy diet, but it’s important to consume them in moderation as they are high in sodium.\nSide Effects of Olives\nHigh Sodium Content\nOlives are high in sodium, which can be problematic for people with high blood pressure, heart disease, or kidney disease. Excessive consumption of olives can increase sodium levels in the body, leading to fluid retention, swelling, and other health problems.\nSome people may be allergic to olives and experience symptoms such as hives, itching, and difficulty breathing. People with a history of allergies or asthma should be cautious when consuming olives or olive products.\nEating too many olives can cause digestive issues such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea. This is due to the high fiber content of olives and the fact that they are often consumed in large quantities.\nInterference with Medications\nOlives and olive products may interact with certain medications, including blood thinners and blood pressure medications. If you are taking medication, it is important to talk to your doctor before consuming olives or olive products.\nRisk of Botulism\nImproperly prepared or stored olives can be a breeding ground for botulism, a type of food poisoning that can be life-threatening. It is important to properly store and prepare olives to reduce the risk of contamination.\nIt is important to consume olives in moderation and follow proper food safety guidelines to avoid potential side effects.\nHere are some frequently asked questions about olives:\nAre olives good for weight loss?\nOlives are a high-fat food and should be consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet. While they are not necessarily a weight-loss food, the fiber in olives can help promote feelings of fullness and reduce overall calorie intake.\nCan olives help with constipation?\nOlives are a good source of fiber, which can help promote regularity and prevent constipation. However, consuming too many olives can also lead to digestive issues such as bloating and diarrhea.\nAre olives a good source of protein?\nOlives are not a significant source of protein. They are higher in fat than protein and are generally consumed for their flavor and nutritional benefits.\nCan olives help reduce cholesterol levels?\nOlives contain monounsaturated fats, which can help lower levels of LDL cholesterol in the body. Consuming olives as part of a balanced diet may help improve cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease.\nCan olives be harmful to dogs?\nOlives are not toxic to dogs, but they are high in sodium and fat and should be consumed in moderation. Eating too many olives can lead to digestive issues in dogs, and the pits can be a choking hazard.\nHow should olives be stored?\nOlives should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight. Once opened, olives should be stored in the refrigerator and consumed within a few weeks. Proper storage can help prevent spoilage and reduce the risk of foodborne illness.\nAre olives vegan?\nOlives are a vegan food, as they are made from the fruit of the olive tree and do not contain animal products. However, some olives may be processed using animal products or stuffed with non-vegan ingredients, so it is important to read labels carefully.']"	['<urn:uuid:e799d7bb-6fa1-41a8-a2d5-4b37c05d9fcd>', '<urn:uuid:292f925d-714e-414c-a8c1-e7fdc643454a>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	10	49	2969
64	How does the brain try to maintain good mental performance in elderly people despite age-related changes?	According to the Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition (STAC), compensatory brain processes are responsible for preserving cognitive performance in older adults despite accumulation of neural changes in the context of healthy aging. This compensatory function involves increased neural activity to support a high level of performance in older adults.	['Healthy aging is usually associated with cognitive declines typically accompanied by increased task-related brain activity in comparison to more youthful counterparts. can only be addressed using a longitudinal design. The current prospective 5 longitudinal study examined brain activation in APOE ε4 service providers (N=24) and non-carriers (N=21). All participants ages 65-85 and cognitively intact at SB-222200 study access underwent task-activated fMRI structural MRI and neuropsychological assessments at baseline 18 and 57 months. fMRI activation was measured in response to a semantic memory task requiring participants to discriminate famous from non-famous names. Results indicated that this trajectory of switch in brain activation while performing this semantic memory task differed between APOE ε4 service providers and non-carriers. The SB-222200 APOE ε4 group exhibited greater activation than the Low Risk group at RB baseline but they subsequently showed a progressive decline in activation during the follow-up periods with corresponding emergence of episodic memory loss and hippocampal atrophy. In contrast the noncarriers demonstrated a gradual increase in activation over the 5-12 months period. Our results are consistent with the STAC model by SB-222200 demonstrating that compensation varies with the severity of underlying neural damage and can be exhausted with the onset of cognitive symptoms and increased structural brain pathology. Our fMRI results could not be attributed to changes in task overall performance group differences in cerebral perfusion or regional cortical atrophy. regional brain activity in healthy elders relative to their more youthful counterparts during the overall performance of a cognitive task. This increased task-related brain activity in healthy elders typically occurs in brain regions also activated by more youthful participants but can also be observed in homologous regions in the opposite hemisphere (Cabeza et al. 2002 Nielson et al. 2002 2006 Some investigators have noted that age-related increases in brain activity occur most often in the frontal cortex; for reviews and discussion observe (Buckner 2004 Eyler et al. 2011 Nielson et al. 2002 This increased neural activity is usually thought to serve as a compensatory function to support a high level of overall performance in older adults (Bangen et al. 2012 Carp et al. 2010 Grady 2008 Han et al. 2009 Nielson et al. 2002 2006 Prvulovic et al. 2005 Reuter-Lorenz and SB-222200 Cappell 2008 Wierenga et al. 2008 One prominent theory the Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition (STAC) (Park and Reuter-Lorenz 2009 posits that compensatory brain processes are responsible for preserving cognitive overall performance in older adults despite accumulation of neural changes in the context of healthy aging (e.g. moderate white matter disease age-related atrophy). This theory identifies neural factors that contribute to maintenance of a specific level of cognitive function and does not address dynamic longitudinal changes occurring during the aging process. More recently these authors (Reuter-Lorenz and Park 2014 revised the STAC theory (STAC-r) to account for both positive (e.g. physical activity) and unfavorable (e.g. presence of brain amyloid) factors that contribute to the rate of change in cognitive function during aging. This revision provides a SB-222200 framework for tracking the trajectory of neural compensation (scaffolding) in response to rate of switch in cognitive processes but empirical validation of the theory is dependent on imaging data derived from extended longitudinal imaging studies. In the current prospective 5 longitudinal fMRI study we examined compensatory neural scaffolding processes in cognitively intact elders at varying genetic risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The most important genetic risk factor for the sporadic form of AD (onset occurring after age 65) is the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (APOE ε4) allele (Farrer et al. 1997 Cross-sectional fMRI studies from our group (Seidenberg et al. 2009 Smith et al. 2011 Woodard et al. 2009 2010 as well as others (Bookheimer et al. 2000 Borghesani et al. 2008 Filippini et al. 2011 Han et al. 2007 Trachtenberg et al. 2012 Wierenga and Bondi 2007 Wierenga et al. 2010 have consistently exhibited greater brain.']	['<urn:uuid:d90dadca-8b43-49fc-a51d-e1c35ac023a1>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	16	50	645
65	chemicals separation methods basic advanced uses	At a basic level, separation methods involve simple processes like using isopropanol to separate ink colors on paper towels through chromatography, demonstrating how molecules can be carried by a solvent through a stationary phase. At an advanced level, there are 12 main categories of separation techniques including ion exchange, mass spectrometry, membrane separations, and particle size separation, which are used in sophisticated applications across industries such as pharmaceutical, environmental, biomedical, petrochemical, and food industries. These techniques can be applied from micro to macro scales, from analytical laboratory work to large-scale industrial processes.	"['Get ready for all the rainbow heart eyes in this easy and gorgeous introduction to chromatography. 🌈😍 Recommended age 3.5+\nThis activity focuses on the concept of solubility and how an appropriate solvent can carry molecules along a stationary phase. Read on for some basic science and how to make some jaw dropping art!\n- Paper Towels\n- Sharpies in several colors\n- Rubbing alcohol/ isopropanol\n- Eye dropper (can also use a spoon in a pinch)\n- Baking sheet or something to protect your table\n- Safety glasses (to protect eyes from the isopropanol)\n- Cut squares from a paper towel (four from a large sheet or two from a select-a-size sheet).\n- Find the center of sheet and using different color Sharpies, heavily color in dots around the center point. Make sure the dots have a lot of ink in them, but don’t puncture the paper towel.\n- Using the eye dropper, drop isopropanol onto the center of the paper towel and watch as the ink radiates out from the center. Keep slowly adding isopropanol to grow your chromatograph.\n- Use your science art to make new crafts or hang it up to display!\nExtra Experiments and Questions\n- Try doing this with water instead of isopropanol. Does it work? What’s happening?\n- Try doing this with washable markers (like Crayola). Which works better- water or isopropanol?\n- Do you think this would work with crayons?\n- How does this relate to stain removal? Why can’t you wash Sharpie out of your clothes with water?\n- Try putting less ink on the dots and see if you can separate some of the colors within the ink. The success of this will vary on the markers/colors you use, but its worth a shot!\nChromatography is used frequently in labs to separate compounds in a mixture. There are many types of chromatography but they are all based on a similar concept: a mobile phase carries your molecules of interest through a stationary phase, and based on the different interactions with the mobile and stationary phase, the different compounds can be separated. This experiment illustrates how a solvent (the isopropanol) can carry soluble molecules (the ink) through a stationary phase (the paper towel). After kids grasp this concept, you can move on to more delicate examples of chromatography like separating the components of fall leaves or a bouquet of flowers. See below for some key definitions to go over.\nChromatography: A way to separate parts of a mixture by moving the mixture and a solvent (mobile phase) along a surface (stationary phase). Because the different parts of the mixture will “prefer” to be on the stationary phase or mobile phase differently, they travel at differing rates, causing the parts to separate.\nSolubility: A demonstration really helps to explain this to kids. They first must know that everything is made up of smaller parts, like molecules, ions, or atoms. Mix sugar or salt into warm water and show them that it seemingly disappears into the water. Explain that the smaller parts are being broken off from the larger crystal and surrounded by water molecules, which keeps them suspended in the liquid. They are still there, we just can’t see them. Then try doing this with chalk or something else that is not soluble in water. They will be able to see the bulk either floating or sinking to the bottom. Explain that these things are insoluble. The sugar or salt have properties that make them want to associate with water, kind of like magnets sticking to each other, while the chalk molecules do not.\nIn this experiment, the ink from Sharpies is soluble in isopropanol but not in water. The isopropanol is called a solvent, and the ink molecules are called the solute.\nMobile Phase: In this experiment, the mobile phase is the isopropanol. It carries the ink molecules along the paper towel through capillary action.\nStationary Phase: In this experiment, the stationary phase is the paper towel. If solute molecules interact strongly with the stationary phase, they will stick to it earlier than molecules with less attraction to it.\nShare the art you create with this project on Instagram and join our community!

67	I work in tech - how has computer security changed since the early days?	The evolution of computer security spans from early mechanical attempts at logical reasoning to today's sophisticated digital protection. In the 13th century, Ramon Llull made the first step towards mechanical computation by creating a paper-based logical machine that could combine elements of thinking. This primitive device influenced later developments in computation theory. Modern security has evolved dramatically, now incorporating advanced measures like biometric authentication, artificial intelligence for threat detection, and zero trust architecture. Additionally, cutting-edge technologies like blockchain provide tamper-proof security, while quantum-resistant cryptography is being developed to address future challenges from quantum computing.	['И рад бы в рай, да дверь то где?\nDoctor Illuminatus Ramon Llull is an amazing figure in the field of philosophy during the Middle Ages, and one of the first people who tried to make logical deductions in a mechanical, rather than a mental way. His method was an early attempt to use logical means to produce knowledge. He demonstrated in an extremely elementary (but nevertheless workable) way that human thought can be described and even imitated by a device. This was a small step towards the thinking machine. But every journey, even the longest, begins with a tiny step.\nAround 1275, Llull designed a method, based on something like a logical machine, which he first described in full in his Ars magna generalis ultima. Ars brevis (“The Ultimate General Art”, published in 1305). This was a method of combining religious and philosophical attributes selected from a number of lists. It was intended as a debating tool for winning Muslims to the Christian faith through logic and reason. Llull’s inspiration for the Ars magna is thought to have come from observing a device called a zairja, which was used by medieval Arab astrologers to calculate ideas by mechanical means. It used the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet to signify 28 categories of philosophic thought. By combining number values associated with the letters and categories, new paths of insight and thought were created.\nThe radical innovation Llull introduced in the realm of logic is, in fact, the construction and the use of a machine made of paper to combine elements of thinking, i.e. elements of language. With the help of connected geometrical figures, following a precisely defined framework of rules, Llull tried to produce all the possible declarations of which the human mind could think. These declarations or statements were nevertheless represented only by a series of signs, that is, chains of letters.\nLet’s take a look to the hardware of Llull’s machine:\nThis doesn’t look very impressive, does it!? It is just three circles and some kind of alphabet.\nThis hardware consists of three circular paper disks fixed on an axis on which they can be turned. The paper disks contain a limited number of letters—a special lullistic alphabet. When the circles are turned, step by step, all possible combinations of these letters are produced. So what is the trick of this machine? Let’s look at the next figure:\nEvery single letter, from B to K, represents not merely itself, but several strictly defined and placed meanings. By writing the letters from B to K as key-terms heading a table, a series of different sentences can be easily constructed. For example, B=Bonitas, C=Magnitudo, D=Duratio, E=Potestas, F=Sapientia, G=Voluntas, H=Virtus, I=Veritas and K=Gloria. This is, initially, the paper-circle called the Prima Figura. The next strictly defined table of words can be produced on the next circle, perhaps as seen on the Secunda Figura (shown below), where we find categories and relations of thinking.\nHence the machine allows all the words to be combined by turning the circles step by step. In this manner, it is possible to connect every word with every other word placed in a position of a table—depending only on the construction of the individual tables. Imagine how Llull could play this out: bearing in mind the inscribed words of the Prima Figura. These nine words are none other than the attributes of God. Combined with a table of nine questions, it is possible to construct the skeleton of the “Proofs of God.” The machine shows all possible statements and declarations about God.\nExamining the next design from the treatise, the so called Tabula Generalis, we can find a very interesting table. Behind these series of letters are the hidden words of the utilized tables. These columns of letters are supposed to represent, very precisely, neither more nor less than, the totality of human wisdom;-), but actually the letters of the lullistic alphabet contain a rich potential of meanings. The connection to a certain site in each table allows each letter to represent unlimited words of unlimited fields.\nSo, this Tabula Generalis must have been something like a subset of the truth table of the logic, described from the notions and defined in the circles. The logic itself consists of all possible reasonable combinations of the notions. While we have no rules, algorithms, or programs to tell which combination was right or wrong, we could have a truth table (One may just wonder “Who knows how to compose such a table, may be the God?”;-). And if we can include in the proper circle each human-defined notion, and we have a proper entry in the table, then we have what? Bingo! We have the Universal Wiseacre.\nLlull’s ideas would be developed further by Giovanni de la Fontana and Nicholas of Cusa in the 15th century (in his work De coniecturis Nicholas developed his method ars generalis coniecturandi, in which he describes a way of making conjectures, illustrated by wheel charts and symbols that much resemble those of Llull), Giordano Bruno in the 16th century (Bruno used the rotating figures of the Lullist system as instruments of a system of artificial memory, and attempted to apply Lullian mnemotechnics to different modes of rhetorical discourse), and by Athanasius Kircher and Gottfried Leibniz in 17th century. That’s why Llull is sometimes considered a pioneer of computation theory, especially given his influence on Leibniz.\nBiography of Ramon Llull\nRamon Llull was born in 1232 (or beginning of 1233) into a prosperous Catalan-Aragonese family in Palma, the capital of the just formed Kingdom of Majorca. He was the only son of Ramon Amat (sobriquet Llull), who had come from Catalonia with the conquering armies of James I three years before, and Isabel d’Erill, who came to Majorca in 1231. Ramon and Isabel were members of bourgeois middle-class families in Barcelona, who in 1229 encouraged and financed the efforts of King James I of Aragon to conquer the island of Majorca, at that time under Muslim dominion, in exchange for land and privileges. Following the triumph over the Moors, they received lands and moved to the island.\nVery little is known about his youth, but Ramon obviously was a restless and clever lad, who spent the first 3 decades of his life as a typical courtier, serving to the King James I and from middle 1250s as a seneschal (the administrative head of the royal household) to the future King James II of Majorca.\nIn 1257 Llull married Blanca Picany (several years younger wealthy relative of the King), and they soon had two children, Domènec (Domingo) and Magdalena. Although he formed a family, he continued licentious and wasteful life of a troubadour up to 1263, when he had a religious epiphany, and decided to dedicate his life to the God. He sold his possessions, reserving a small portion for his wife and children, and made a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Upon his return to Mallorca, he dedicated the rest of his life to learning, translating, teaching, writing, and travelling through Europe and North Africa.\nLlull was extremely prolific author, and starting from early 1270s he wrote a total of more than 250 works in Catalan, Latin, and Arabic, in a variety of styles and genres, and often translating from one language to the others. The romantic novel Blanquerna is widely considered the first major work of literature written in Catalan, and possibly the first European novel.\nIn 1314, at the age of 82, Llull traveled to North Africa to promote catechesis, but was stoned by an angry crowd of Muslims in Tunis. Genoese merchants took him back to Mallorca, where he died at home sometime in the first quarter of 1316.', 'Modern Security Measures: Protecting the Digital Frontier\nIn the digital age, where information is the most valuable currency, the need for robust security measures has never been greater. As technology evolves at an unprecedented pace, so do the methods and tactics of cybercriminals. To safeguard our data, privacy, and digital assets, modern security measures have emerged as our digital armor. In this blog post, we will delve into the cutting-edge security measures that are shaping the landscape of online protection.\n- Biometric Authentication: Beyond Passwords\nPasswords have long been the traditional gatekeepers of our digital realms. However, they have proven to be fallible, susceptible to hacking, and often challenging to remember. Modern security measures are shifting towards biometric authentication, utilizing unique physical or behavioral traits for identity verification. From fingerprint and facial recognition to voice and iris scans, biometric authentication adds an extra layer of security that is not easily replicable.\n- Zero Trust Architecture: Trust No One\nGone are the days when we could trust the security of our networks solely based on location or network boundaries. Zero Trust Architecture takes a skeptical approach, assuming that threats exist both outside and inside the network. This model enforces strict identity verification and access control, ensuring that no one – not even those within your organization – can access sensitive data without proper authorization.\n- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\nHarnessing the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning, security systems have become smarter and more adaptable. These technologies can analyze vast amounts of data in real-time, detecting anomalies and patterns that might elude human analysts. From identifying potential threats to preventing data breaches, AI and ML have become indispensable tools in the modern security arsenal.\n- Blockchain Technology: Immutable Security\nBlockchain, originally designed for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, has found its way into cybersecurity. Its decentralized, tamper-proof ledger system makes it ideal for securing sensitive data and transactions. By eliminating the need for a central authority, blockchain provides a level of transparency and security that was previously unattainable.\n- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): The New Norm\nTo reduce the risk of unauthorized access, multi-factor authentication (MFA) has become commonplace. MFA requires users to provide multiple forms of verification, typically something they know (password), something they have (smartphone or token), and something they are (biometric data). This multi-layered approach significantly enhances security.\n- Threat Hunting: Staying Ahead of the Game\nInstead of merely reacting to threats, modern security measures involve proactive threat hunting. Skilled cybersecurity professionals actively seek out potential threats, vulnerabilities, and anomalies within a network, identifying and mitigating risks before they can be exploited.\n- Cloud Security: Protecting the Virtual Realm\nWith the rapid migration to the cloud, cloud security has gained paramount importance. Advanced encryption, access controls, and continuous monitoring are now integral to securing data stored in cloud environments. Cloud providers themselves are also investing heavily in ensuring the security of their platforms.\n- Quantum-Resistant Cryptography\nAs quantum computing advances, it poses a potential threat to existing encryption algorithms. Modern security measures are preparing for this quantum era by developing quantum-resistant cryptography, which can withstand the computational power of quantum computers.\n- Employee Training and Awareness\nNo matter how advanced security measures become, the weakest link in any security chain is often the human element. Comprehensive employee training and awareness programs are crucial to educate individuals about cyber threats and safe online practices.\nIn conclusion, modern security measures are a dynamic response to the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats. By incorporating biometrics, zero trust architecture, AI and ML, blockchain, MFA, threat hunting, cloud security, quantum-resistant cryptography, and employee education, we are building a formidable defense against cybercriminals. As technology continues to advance, so too must our security measures, ensuring that we can confidently navigate the digital frontier without fear of compromise.']	['<urn:uuid:6c38f72a-3652-4efa-a142-307b75ae5536>', '<urn:uuid:0920d2d8-2540-4590-8e64-d0a37aa3e91c>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	14	94	1921
68	What were the similarities between Washington's personal role as a family man at Mount Vernon and his public duties in service of American independence?	As a family man, Washington showed deep commitment and responsibility, taking care of Martha's children Jacky and Patsy, and welcoming various nieces and nephews at Mount Vernon. Similarly, in his public service, he demonstrated strong dedication to duty and leadership, as evidenced in military conflicts and political roles. Both aspects of his life required sacrifice - at home he faced personal tragedy with Patsy's death, while in public service he faced the challenges of war and revolution. His attachment to Mount Vernon as a refuge paralleled his commitment to the broader cause of American independence, where documents show he valued both liberty and established government, believing in the right of people to establish and maintain their government while emphasizing duty and obligation.

Through his heroics in the French and Indian War (1754 - 1763), he established a reputation that made him a legend throughout the British Empire. But when the Royal Army refused to commission him as a British officer, he returned to civilian life at Mount Vernon, unhappy and deeply disappointed. He immediately threw himself into political life, winning a seat in the Virginia House of Burgesses. A few years later, he was appointed a justice of the peace. A new chapter in his life began in early 1758, when he was invited to the home of the recently widowed Martha Dandridge Custis. They married ten months later. Washington now focused on the farms of Mount Vernon, introducing wheat as a primary crop. These were happy years for the Washington family until the untimely death of Martha\'s daughter ""Patsy"" at the age of 17 in 1773.\nHow did Washington\'s earliest military experience shape his leadership?\nIn 1753, Great Britain and France were poised for conflict in the Ohio Territory, each nation viewing the other\'s encroachments as a threat to their interests there. George Washington, then just 21 years old, was one of a very few Virginians with knowledge of the northwest frontier, gleaned during his years as a surveyor. He volunteered for a special mission to inform the French of their ""eviction"" from British-claimed lands. Traveling 250 miles over difficult, if not impossible terrain, and through weeks of constant rain or snow, Washington delivered the message to the commander of Fort Le Boeuf. The trip back to Virginia was even more harrowing, with Washington nearly drowning when pitched from a raft into an ice-clogged river. Despite the hardship, the groundwork for what would become his legendary fearlessness and physical superiority was laid during this trip. But it was the publication of his journal of the mission that would immortalize his reputation for daring and extraordinary personal bravery, and provide the spark which would ignite the French and Indian War.\nWhat do we know of Washington\'s physical appearance and bearing?\nThe real George Washington has been a victim of the passage of time for most Americans. When we think of him at all, it is as a caricature or prop to decorate for the holidays or sell cars. What a tragedy that the distinctive qualities that made him an exceptional figure in history have been hollowed out of the Father of our Country. In every respect, Washington was a giant of a man, keenly aware of the effect his appearance and demeanor had on others. Sources cite his height as between 6\' and 6\'3"", weighing 175 pounds as a young man and 200 - 220 pounds by his 40s. He had large frame, wearing size 13 boots and gloves tailor-made to fit his large, expressive hands. Contemporaries describe him as supremely athletic and graceful, projecting great physical prowess. Washington had a fair complexion, with a tendency to sunburn, blue-gray eyes, and hair described as sandy-brown to a darker, reddish brown, which he powdered for effect. Washington had strong, masculine facial features with pockmarks from a case of smallpox as a teenager. He was both strategic and fastidious in his dress, possessing a sophisticated understanding of how to enhance his already formidable form. When George Washington walked into a room, his was a magnificent, unforgettable presence.\nWhat do we know about Washington\'s marriage and family life?\nThough marriage to Martha Custis made George Washington a very wealthy man, it appears to have been a love match in every respect. He was 26, and she, eight months older at 27. It does not take any stretch of the imagination to understand how a pretty and diminutive (five-feet tall) Martha was smitten by the tall, handsome, somewhat-reserved, young officer, as she greeted him at the Custis plantation in early 1758. George likely experienced the same physical attraction, with an instant appreciation for her warmth and her vivacious personality. Martha was a widow. She and first husband Daniel Parke Custis-twenty years her senior-had produced four children. Sadly, their firstborn daughter and son had died at ages four and three, respectively. When George and Martha married, her surviving children, John Parke Custis, ""Jacky,"" and Martha Parke Custis, ""Patsy,"" were just five and three years of age. George and Martha adored the children-arguably indulging them to excess, perhaps because they would have none of their own. In addition to raising Jacky and Patsy, the Washingtons took two grandchildren into their home. Nieces and nephews from both the Washington and Dandridge families were welcomed at Mount Vernon over the years. But this interlude of contentment ended when Patsy began having epileptic seizures at the age of 11. As her parents watched over her anxiously, the seizures became increasingly debilitating before her untimely death at 17. Martha Washington would outlive all four of her children.\nWhy are George Washington and Mount Vernon so closely associated?\nWashington inherited Mount Vernon outright upon the death of his sister-in-law, Ann Fairfax Washington, in 1761. He had leased the property since 1754, not long after Lawrence Washington\'s death. Anticipating his new family through marriage to Martha, George added a third story to Mount Vernon, the first of many improvements he would make over the years. George and Martha, along with Jacky and Patsy, moved into the home in April 1759, three months after their wedding. Here at Mount Vernon, George Washington channeled the same energy and passion into the role of planter as he had invested in his military career. He was a farmer at heart and an engaged steward of the land. Washington was an agricultural innovator. He was progressive in his approach to animal husbandry and forward-thinking in his introduction of wheat into what had been tobacco country for many generations. He chronicled the many improvements he made to the estate in his meticulous journals. Despite the dramatic transitions their lives would take over the next four decades, Mount Vernon remained the idyllic refuge to which George and Martha Washington always yearned to return.']"	['<urn:uuid:e2641810-b5e0-427d-b724-54343cd7ce55>', '<urn:uuid:0deef0cb-6efd-419b-8814-58705ca8b788>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	24	122	1742
69	deep roots tallgrass prairie water uptake	While tallgrass prairie species have deep roots, they primarily rely on surface roots (0-10cm) for water uptake. Deep roots have severely reduced stele/cortex ratio and exponentially less root biomass compared to surface soils, making them functionally unable to support the aboveground plant water demand.	"[""Growth and flux responses to environmental gradients in tallgrass prairie\nKonza Prairie Biological Station: Photo credit: Judd Patterson\nGenerally, ecologists have environmental data at the leaf scale, at the scale of the watershed using eddy covariance towers (100s of meters), and at regional scales (using satellite imagery). However, much of the within-watershed spatial variability in ecosystems (and tallgrass prairie in particular) occurs at length scales of 20 to 50 m. To assess this missing scale of water and energy flux, we have operated landscape sensor networks that can obtain continuous measurements of key environmental variables (including VPD, soil moisture, air/soil/canopy temperature, windspeed / direction, and irradiance) since 2008.\nWorking with Nate Brunsell (Geography - KU), our goals for this project are: (1) Increase our ability to predict the environmental drivers of energy / water flux in the community (dominant grasses and forbs) (2) document environmental variability and drivers of biological responses along topographic gradients, and (3) scale the physiological responses of these plant communities to the landscape energy and water balance\nWatershed 4B on Konza (Sept. 2011). Reddish patches are 'shrub islands' of Cornus drummondii\nOver the last 150 years, and the last 50 years in particular, woody plants have expanded into long-standing grasslands and savannas on every continent except Antarctica—a phenomenon known as woody encroachment. Woody encroachment has a negative impact on plant diversity in North America and in some cases, leads to desertification. We’re studying how internal dynamics of shrub-grass competition interact with the external forcing of global change, in order to understand tree-grass competition in general, and how the balance of trees vs. grasses will change in the future.\nTo guide our research, we use a conceptual framework built from aspects of theoretical savanna ecology, stable-state theory, and coexistence theory. We’re applying these perspectives to a diverse group of data-types, including long-term data-sets of grass/shrub cover, physiological measurements of plant form and function, and vital rates of shrubs (i.e. demography). Our first goal is to test whether the spatial and temporal patterns of woody encroachment fit the construct of bi-stability. If woody encroachment is governed by stable-state dynamics, what mechanisms (i.e. positive/negative feedbacks) result in bi-stability? Where and when do tipping points occur (i.e. what is the resilience to press and pulse pressures, solo and in tandem)? By answering these questions, we hope to develop generalizable models of shrub-grass bi-stability, which can be used to answer theoretical and applied questions.\nA few years ago, our own Teall Culbertson initiated a project on Konza Prairie to determine the drinking water sources of the captive bison herd. Her results showed a reliance by this herd on ephemeral water sources (puddles, wallows) and water from forage [published in Ecosphere in Feb. 2013]. Using this novel isotopic approach, we are now working with Tony Swemmer (SAEON - Ndlovu Node) and Michelle Henley (Save the Elephants .ORG). Michelle is one of the foremost experts of elephant ecology, and has many GPS-collared individuals. Working together, we hope to collect data for the next several years (2013-15) to create a detailed picture of resource availability, use, and patterns of movements for elephants in northeast South Africa.\nThe most under-studied aspect of ecology is the below-ground world of plant roots. While we all acknowledge the sweeping significance of roots on ecosystem processes, quantifying root abundance, form, and function is extremely difficult. Thus, we tend to ignore everything going on belowground!\nSince the research of Weaver in the 1930's-50's, we have known about the occurrence of deep roots in the mesic tallgrass prairies of North America. However, we now know that most of these grasses rely heavily on surface roots (0-10cm) for water uptake, regardless of deep roots. Thus, why do tallgrass species have deep roots, what is the distribution of roots across the soil profile, and how does root class (length / width) change by depth and according to managment activities (burning / grazing)?\nIn addition to asking questions of root type and distribution, we want to know how the types of roots produced impacts the potential hydraulic capacity of the whole plant. For example, what is the capacity of roots produced at great depths (over a meter deep) to deliver water to the surface plant? Our preliminary data suggests that deep roots have severely reduced stele / cortex ratio. Coupled with the fact that there is exponentionally less root biomass at depth than surface soils, most grasses in this system functionally cannot rely on deep soil moisture to support the aboveground plant water demand.\nIn Mapungubwe National Park, in northern South Africa, riparian forests along the Limpopo River have contracted, and extensive stands of closed-canopy forest once dominated by Acacia xanthophloea, Faidherbia albida, Ficus sycomorus have been replaced by savanna. Water availability for these forests has changed over time, with altered flow in the Limpopo River. Since 2012, we have worked with Tony Swemmer (SAEON - Ndlovu Node) and Tim O'Connor (SAEON) to understand the spatial and temporal patterns of water-use among these trees.\nOur results to date show that species most suseptible to mortality have a greater reliance on water from unsaturated soils and /or are more suseptible to elephant damage. In addition, we have preliminary data that suggests that expansion of the sub-canopy / small tree Croton megalobotrys (feverberry) may have a novel source-water strategy compared to coexisting tree species. Thus, multiple interacting factors are having species-specific impacts in the Mapungubwe riparian forests, with consequences for habitat availability, hydrology, and biodiversity in this system.\nClimate change, atmospheric chemistry changes, and invasive species are altering plant communities in natural areas of the Colorado Front Range, but more rapid and dramatic community transformations are believed underway as a result of native consumer activities interacting with these other change factors. Research proposed here addresses two important questions: 1) What are the mechanisms that allow for winter annual species to become a dominant life form along the Colorado Front Range, and 2) do these new plant species alter the role of prairie dogs from that of a keystone species to one of an ecosystem transformer?\nWorking with Tim Seastedt (CU- Boulder) and Laurel Hartley (CU-Denver), we are examining if if the combination of expanded growing season and wetter winter conditions favors the emergence of a ‘new’ group of dominant plants on the Front Range, the winter annuals, and manipulations will document the consequences and feedbacks of these plants on the native perennial species. The emergence of a new temporal niche, occupied by species new to the region, is hypothesized to cause a cascade of biogeochemical feedbacks that sustain the abundance of this new group.Thus, global changes result in a ‘keystone species’ functioning as an ‘ecosystem transformer’, with grasslands being converted to shrublands or other novel ecosystems. While effects to date appear strongest along the urban-wildlands corridor, the expansion of global change factors into the shortgrass steppe and mixed grass prairies may expand the region where ‘desertification effects’ of prairie dogs are anticipated.\nA fundamental challenge for ecology is to explain the apparently stable coexistence of trees and grasses in savannas and woodlands, which are poised in the continuum between forests (which are completely tree-dominated) and grasslands (which lack trees). Why do trees not displace grasses in these environments? Water availability is the likely factor constraining tree cover, but the mechanisms driving this constraint are still unknown. The goal of this proposal is to comprehensively tackle this problem from an ecohydrological perspective. This requires that we resolve how trees and grasses a) use and b) partition soil moisture as a function of depth across a wide range of environmental conditions.\nWe are working with Ricardo Holdo at the University of Missouri to address three primary research objectives: (1) characterize the spatiotemporal partitioning of soil moisture by trees and grasses across climatic and edaphic gradients, (2) quantify the strength of tree-grass competition in tropical savannas, and (3) identify key interspecific ecohydrological tradeoffs of tree and grass rooting niches.""]"	['<urn:uuid:fc8691a4-f3a2-4d17-a049-386942746621>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	6	44	1320

Notre Dame Law School, established in 1869, is the oldest Catholic law school in the United States. Its approach to legal education is distinctively shaped by faith, with students being trained to view law as a vocation in service to others. The school emphasizes exploring both the moral and ethical dimensions of law, and encourages students to discover their unique roles in advancing justice.

71	huangya mutianyu great wall renovation history	The Huangya Pass was originally built during the Northern Qi Dynasty (550-577 AD) and later rebuilt during the Ming Dynasty by general Qi Jiguang. It underwent major renovation in 1984 as part of Deng Xiaoping's initiative. Similarly, the Mutianyu section was built in the Northern Qi Dynasty and restored in the early Ming Dynasty under general Xu Da. Both sections represent important historical renovations of the Great Wall.	"['Winding its way through the mountains of Tianjin’s Ji County at an average altitude of 701 metres (2,300 ft.), Huangya or “Yellow Cliff” Pass represents one of the most integral yet overlooked sections of the Great Wall. Its unusual name is derived from the cliff rocks to the east of the pass, as they are mostly yellow in colour. At sunset, they are said to appear as though gilded in gold. The Huangya section actually stretches for a whopping 42 kilometres (26 mi), from Malan Pass in Hebei province to Jiangjun Pass in Beijing. As part of the Great Wall, it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987.\nIt was originally constructed sometime during the Northern Qi Dynasty (550-577 AD), but was rebuilt and reinforced with bricks and towers by a military general named Qi Jiguang during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). As if that wasn’t enough, it was heavily renovated in 1984 as part of an incentive proposed by politician Deng Xiaoping to “Love China, Restore the Great Wall”. This colossal renovation project meant that over 3 kilometres (2 mi) of the Huangya section, including 20 watchtowers, one pass fort, and one gatehouse, were given a much-needed facelift! Nowadays, although it may not appear as authentic or “wild” as other parts of the Great Wall, Huangya Pass is the ideal place for a challenging historical hike without having to battle the tourist crowds.\nNicknamed the Eight Trigrams Fortification City, the pass is known for the 40 crisscrossing streets within its walls, which were designed after the shape of the Bagua(1) or “Eight Trigrams” symbol. At the centre of this labyrinthine system lies the Great Wall Museum, which once served as the Dispatcher’s Office during the Ming Dynasty. With spectacular exhibits of the weapons and items used by soldiers patrolling the Great Wall, it offers a fascinating insight into what life was like during the height of the wall’s importance. The museum also highlights the strategic military significance that this stretch of the wall once held. Watchtowers form a focal part of this section. They are either solid or hollow and come in a variety of shapes, from round to square.\nWhile the watchtowers are a common feature throughout any part of the Great Wall, the Huangya Water Gate is reasonably unique to Huangya Pass. This giant bridge spanning the nearby river was built with five arches, which could be closed or opened in order to enable or impede the flow of water. During wartime, the arches would be closed and soldiers would settle gun barrels along the battlements of the bridge in order to defend against any enemy utilising the waterway. In short, Ming soldiers knew how to handle themselves during a water fight!\nAnother unusual feature of this section is the Huangya Sky Ladder, the steepest stairway along this stretch of wall. Its nickname derives from the fact that it appears to rise at an almost vertical slant and, from its base, it looks as though it leads straight to the sky! Once you’ve conquered this challenging climb, you’ll be treated to a panoramic view of a primitive stretch of the Great Wall that dates back to the Northern Qi Dynasty.\nOn the opposite end of the Huangya section, you’ll find Taipingzhai or the Taiping Mountain Stronghold. Spanning just 1,000 metres (3,281 ft.), it once played a focal role as a vital mountain fortress during the Ming Dynasty. A statue of Qi Jiguang marks the entrance, commemorating the general whose noble efforts helped to protect China’s northern borders. To the west of the main stronghold lies the Widow Tower, a two-storey square beacon tower that was built using funds donated by twelve widows whose husbands lost their lives while building the wall. If you look closely, you’ll notice intricate dragon’s head sculptures and statues of qilins (Chinese unicorns), phoenixes, and lions crouching on the eaves of its roof.\nAlthough you can enter the Huangya section at the Huangya Pass entrance, it’s usually recommended that you start your hike from the Taiping Mountain Stronghold entrance, since the downhill slant will provide you with some respite from the wall’s mercilessly steep stairways. Once you reach the pass, which typically takes between two to three hours, there are plenty of farmhouses dotted about serving up fresh, rustic meals for weary hikers. If a leisurely pace is too slow for your speedy sensibilities, you can always consider taking part in the Great Wall Marathon!\nEvery year in May, a marathon race is held along the Huangya section of the Great Wall, with thousands of runners taking part annually. While there are now numerous marathons being held on other sections of the Great Wall, the Huangya marathon is one of the oldest and has been held since 1999. Over time, its popularity around the world meant it developed into an international event that is now acknowledged by the Association of International Marathons and Distance Races (AIMS). The full marathon covers the entire 42 kilometres (26 mi) of the Huangya section, although there is an optional half marathon, 10-kilometre (6 mi) run, 5-kilometre (3 mi) run, and child-friendly 8.5 kilometre (5 mi) Fun Run. If you think the run is too difficult, just remember: this was all in a day’s work for a Ming Dynasty soldier!\n(1) Bagua: The eight trigrams used in Taoist philosophy to represent the fundamental principles of reality.

Today, the wall is considered one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. The wall ismade up of many sections built over time by the different ruling dynasties. Thebest preserved are just outside of Beijing, with many Steppes clients visitingthe Mutianyu or Jinshanling sections of the Great Wall. 1.\nFamed forits Ming-era guard towers and excellent views, the 3km-long section of wall at Mùtiányù, was built and restored in theearly Ming Dynasty (1368 – 1644) on the remnants of a Wall originally built inthe Northern Qi Dynasty (550-577). Reconstruction took place under thesupervision of Xu Da, one of the founding generals of the Ming Dynasty, who wasresponsible for building a Wall from Shanhaiguan in the east to as far asMutianyu. TheMutianyu section of the Great Wall of China offers an alternative Great Wallexperience to the popular Badaling section. This segment of China’s ancientengineering marvel features an optional cable car ride, or an opportunity toclimb more than 1, 400 steps to the top.\nThe Mutianyu Great Wall is much steeperthan the Badaling section, and offers a more challenging climb. This section isalso older than Badaling, and features outer and inner parapets and threewatchtowers. While notas ‘ pristine’ as other parts, it’s best for older travelers, families withsmall children, those who don’t love sheer drops and those short on time. Travelto the restored Mutianyu section and climb the Ming Dynasty watchtowers forincredible views of the Great Wall and the surrounding countryside. You candescend the wall by toboggan or take in the aerial view by cable car (at anadditional cost). You’ll then enjoy a traditional Chinese lunch and finish yourday back in Beijing.\nFrom thegargantuan ticket office at Mùtiányù, shuttle buses (¥15) run the 3km to themain entrance, from where three or four stepped pathways lead up to the wallitself. There’s also a cablecar, a chairlift, called a ‘ ropeway’ on the signshere, and a tobogganride, making this ideal for those who can’t manage too many steps, or who havekids in tow.

72	tooth cap maintenance recommendations potential alternatives	Dental crowns require regular maintenance including daily brushing and flossing, avoiding sticky foods and hard items like raw vegetables, and scheduling regular six-month cleanings. When flossing, the floss should be slid out rather than lifted. While alternatives exist, such as dental implants, dentures, and fillings, dental crowns are typically considered the least invasive procedure for resolving various oral health issues.	"[""Porcelain Caps or Crowns come in different variety. Porcelain is the most existing because it is most attractive and looks very natural, like metal crowns. Porcelain crown is a custom made artificial tooth cover that completely hide the scarred tooth, Porcelain also known as 'Dental Crown ' and 'Caps', Porcelain crowns can be made to match your teeth in color, size, and shape. This gives you a beautiful, natural looking and permanent smile on your face. In general, Porcelain crowns are used to protect the teeth that need more structural collaboration and protection for long-term vault fillings or inlays.....\nPorcelain Crowns comes in two parts: first is 'temporary' and the second is 'permanent'. A temporary crown can be made at the dentist's office, and it's typically constructed of acrylic or stainless steel. On the other way, the permanent crown is manufactured in a dental laboratory. Permanent crowns are mostly made of gold alloy, or Porcelain - both of which are extremely solid and long lasting. The Porcelain variety is being used more and more, as it is a beautiful choice, and will not affect people will allergies to certain types of metal.\nYour dentist will take an x-ray of your tooth before thinking on whether or not you need a crown or dental cap, and then will discuss all your options with you. If you have any questions regarding that, be sure to ask them before your process is on stream. A root canal may need to be performed prior to the crown to prevent the risk of infection. Your mouth is then knocking out and your tooth is gently filed down. Once your tooth is at the correct size and shape to properly fit the crown, putty is applied to make an impression. The impression is sent to be manufactured into a crown. If using Porcelain, your dentist will choose a shade that most closely matches the shade of your existing teeth. You will have to return to the office to have the crown put in place after it has been prepared.\nNow you need to special attention for first few days for you newly crown and caps, especially if you have had a temporary crown put in place. Don't chew sticky or chewy food or anything very hard (raw vegetables, apples, etc.). Avoid chewing gum, and be sure to floss daily. When you floss, don't lift out, but rather slide the floss out from between the crown. You may experience discomfort or sensitivity in the area at first, and this is completely normal. If you are experiencing sensitivity to heat or cold, try toothpaste designed for people with sensitive teeth. Your new crown will require regular maintenance and check-ups from your dentist, so be sure to schedule these along with your six-month cleanings. If you have a temporary crown put in, be sure to give it extra care, as these are not as sturdy as more permanent varieties.\nBenefits of Porcelain crowns\nToday porcelain, ceramic, and porcelain-metal mix dental crowns, offered at most aesthetic dental clinics, are custom matched to the color of your actual teeth and are designed specifically for your smile in order to provide the most accurate, aesthetically pleasing results.\nDental crowns are used to cover dental implant to comfortably work together with your existing natural teeth. Porcelain crowns to crowns made with other material. They look and feel like actual teeth. The translucent quality makes the most natural look. That will last about fifteen to twenty years if well care for with brushing and flossing. Modern Porcelain crowns are also designed to look more like natural enamel and the use of any metal that could spoil a bit the look of the new crown, despite being really hard."", 'Patients with cracked, broken, or damaged teeth might be advised by their oral health professional to get dental crowns. This procedure can dramatically help patients when it comes to easing pain and discomfort, protecting teeth from further damage, and completing smile restoration or enhancement. This guide will give patients the information they need to know if they are considering dental crowns.\nWhat are Dental Crowns?\nDental crowns are artificial teeth installed in the mouth. They can be used to complete a dental implant or can be bonded to the top of an existing tooth. Dental crowns work to protect the tooth by covering any damage to it and preventing worse damage from occurring. There are many different types of dental crowns, and they can be made from different materials to fit each patient’s needs and budget.\nDental Crowns Before and After 1\nHow Long do Dental Crowns Last?\nDental crowns usually last between five and 15 years. It is important to note that the way a dental crown is cared for will dramatically impact its lifespan. Patients looking to get the most time out of their dental crowns should minimize sticky foods and be sure to brush and floss regularly, as well as visiting the dentist at least every six months for an examination and cleaning. Additionally, habits like chewing ice or fingernails, or using teeth to open a package can also reduce the lifespan of dental crowns.\nCan Anyone Notice Dental Crowns?\nDental crowns are usually designed to not be noticed. Crowns that go in the back of the mouth might be made of gold or stainless steel, but crowns in the visible areas of the mouth will usually be made of porcelain or resin that closely resembles the appearance, color, and texture of a patient’s natural teeth. As a result, someone you know well could have dental crowns and you might not ever realize it.\nWhat Kind of Results Can Patients Expect?\nPatients should always ask to see pictures of past results when they are talking to their dentist about dental crowns. This will give patients a good idea of what to expect when it comes to their dental crown procedure. Most patients are happy with their dental crowns, and have reported less pain and discomfort, a better smile, more confidence, an easier time chewing food, and fewer complications with their oral hygiene as a result of their dental crowns.\nDental Crowns Before and After 1\nHow Are Dental Crowns Cared For?\nDental crowns are cared for just like regular teeth. Patients should brush and floss regularly, and see an oral health professional at least every six months for routine cleaning and examinations. Patients can increase the lifespan of their crowns by avoiding very hard foods, sticky foods, and destructive oral health habits like smoking, eating sticky foods, chewing on finger nails, or opening packaging with teeth.\nAre there Any Alternatives to Dental Crowns?\nThere are some alternatives to dental crowns for some patients, but, for the most part, dental crowns are the least invasive procedure that will resolve many oral health issues. Alternatives include dental implants, dentures, fillings, and other options that might not be as effective or may be much more involved when compared to dental crowns.\nAs you can see, dental crowns are a safe, effective option for many patients suffering from broken, cracked, discolored, stained, or otherwise damaged teeth. The result is less pain and discomfort and an easier time eating food. Patients also report feeling better about their smile, and an increased sense of overall well-being. The flexibility when it comes to materials and the procedure means that there is a dental crown solution for many patients.']"	['<urn:uuid:611f756b-9f2c-4d73-b325-e5cc82e7acb9>', '<urn:uuid:eab99c28-06eb-465c-80c3-6f9567cdbdf9>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	6	60	1238

The best viewing times are typically March through May. While visiting these areas, it's crucial to protect the environment by following strict rules: stay on designated trails, no removal of plants or historical artifacts, no feeding wildlife, maintain quiet, drive at moderate speeds, and pack out all litter. Campfires are only permitted in designated areas under appropriate conditions, and smoking is strictly prohibited. These regulations help preserve the natural heritage and protect local flora and fauna.	['Spring has sprung, and the wildflowers are here! Spectacular color displays are dotting hillsides and wilderness areas across the nation. It’s time to hop in the car and experience the blooms while they last.\nAlthough sightseers can spot wildflowers year-round, they’re most abundant during the spring due to the influx of sunlight after months of rain or snow. Road trips are a good way to get outside, see the sights, and cover a lot of ground.\nWhile there are plenty of options for locations to view the flowers, not all road trips are created equal. Here, we’ve rounded up five of the best U.S. road trips for viewing wildflowers as well as favorite places to stop, the types of flowers you can expect to see, and the best times to visit.\nKey Items to Bring\n- Camera for documenting your sightings (could be a smartphone camera or a DSLR)\n- Hiking boots for exploring on foot\n- Field guide for identifying flowers\n- Binoculars for birding and faraway views\n- Water bottle (gotta have the H2O)\n- Backpack for stashing all the essentials\nBest Spring Road Trips for Wildflower Viewing\nGeorge Washington Memorial Parkway: Virginia & Maryland\nSpanning approximately 27 miles across Virginia and Maryland, the Georgia Washington Memorial Parkway is a drive through history with scenic views along the way.\nThe drive follows the Potomac River and passes George Washington’s Mount Vernon home, the U.S. Capitol, the Arlington National Cemetery, Theodore Roosevelt Island, and many other historical locations.\nDuring the springtime, over 500 species of wildflowers have been documented along the highway, with the most spectacular showing in Turkey Run Park. In the park, the Potomac Heritage Trail offers a variety of popular hikes, with an assortment of flowers such as the Virginia bluebells, purple spring cress, and blue phlox along the way.\nFor the best chance of viewing the wildflowers, visit between mid-to-late March to mid-to-late April.\nNewfound Gap Road: North Carolina & Tennessee\nBeginning at the Sugarlands Visitor Center and finishing at the Mountain Farm Museum, the 34-mile road traverses through the famous Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\nThe drive takes anywhere from 60 to 90 minutes depending on how many detours you make. Popular stopping points include the Campbell Overlook, Chimney Tops Picnic Area, Newfound Gap, Clingmans Dome Road, Smokemont Campground, Mingus Mill, and Oconaluftee Visitor Center.\nIf you visit during the springtime, you’ll be treated to views of mountain laurels, catawba rhododendron, flame azalea, and an assortment of other wildflowers along the way.\nFlowers can be spotted anytime between February and September, but to maximize your chances, visit between early spring and early summer.\nJoshua Tree National Park: California\nLocated in Southern California, Joshua Tree National Park is known for its stark desert landscape, rugged rock formations, and the Joshua trees from which it gets its name.\nTo make the most of a day at the park, begin at the Cottonwood Visitor Center and drive the 50-mile road through the park to the town of Joshua Tree. Popular stopping points along the way include Cottonwood Spring, Ocotillo Patch, Chollo Cactus Garden, Arch Rock, Skull Rock, and Barker Dam. The timing and expanse of the wildflower blooms depend on fall and winter precipitation levels and spring temperatures.\nFlowers typically begin to bloom at lower elevations in February and at higher elevations in March and April. Popular sightings include the desert paintbrush, Utah firecracker, evening primrose, Mojave aster, grizzly bear prickly pear cactus, and many others.\nTexas Hill Country: Texas\nThe Texas Hill Country is home to a variety of landscapes such as rolling hills, rocky canyons, grasslands, woodlands, and savanna that is dotted with small towns, secluded swimming holes, and, of course, wildflowers.\nWhile there are many options for road trips in the Hill Country, a popular choice is to begin in Austin and work your way the 45 miles across the countryside to Gruene Hall in New Braunfels. Must-see stops along the way are the Hamilton Pool Preserve, LBJ State Park and Historic Site, Enchanted Rock State National Area, Cave Without a Name, and Guadalupe River State Park.\nAlthough wildflowers can be seen along the entire drive in the spring, the Willow City Loop is a big hit during the spring months, as there are wildflowers aplenty. On the hike, you’ll likely encounter bluebonnets, coreopsis, sunflowers, firewheels, and many more.\nPrimetime for blooms tends to be during March, April, and May.\nColumbia River Highway: Oregon\nCompleted in 1921, the Columbia River Highway was one of the first U.S. highways designed for scenic touring. The 350-mile highway begins in Astoria and ends in Pendleton, passing through temperate rainforest and by maples, conifers, ferns, and a collection of wildflowers.\nThere is much to see along the route, but highlights include a collection of jaw-dropping waterfalls: LaTourell Falls, Shepperd’s Dell Falls, Bridal Veil Falls, Wahkeena Falls, Multnomah Falls, Oneonta Falls, and Horsetail Falls.\nYou can spot flowers all along the route, but an especially good place to see them is in Hood River, specifically along the Mosier Plateau Trail.\nHundreds of species of wildflowers have made the Columbia River Gorge their home, including the Columbia kittentail, long-beard hawkweed, balsamroot, lupine, Howell’s daisy, northern wormwood, smooth desert parsley, and many more.', 'Rules and Recommendations\nWELCOME TO THE PROTECTED AREAS\nThe preservation and protection of the natural and cultural heritage of our country depends on our actions and consciousness.

74	What architectural features characterized the Iron Banking Company building?	The Iron Banking Company building, constructed in 1871, was built in the Italianate style of architecture that was popular in the mid to late-1800s. It featured a rectangular shape with a row of seven tall front windows that were rounded on top. The building had a cast iron front that was supplied by the Geddes & Pierce Foundry.	['PIERCE’S IRON BANKING BUILDING\nby Ann Angel Eberhardt\nPIERCE’S IRON BANKING BUILDING\nThere was a lot of trust in the hearts of small-town citizens in the 1950s. In fact, I don’t remember if we even thought much about it. Trust was something that was taken for granted when doors were left unlocked overnight or we children ran about the neighborhood unsupervised. In those days, there were no such things as identity theft, car alarms or security cameras.\nAn example of this was my father’s instinctive trust, not only in us kids but in small-town society in general, when he sent us to the bank each week to deposit cash and checks from his printing business. I can still picture my brother or myself, about 9 and 11 years old, carrying that yellow King Edward cigar box weighed down with rolls of coins and checks as we walked along the dirt path that ran between our Second Street house and the Erie Railroad tracks. When we reached North Walnut Street we would leave the path to turn left, cross the tracks, then take a right on East Shenango Street.\nAfter another block or two, we reached a row of buildings that included the three-story First National Bank on the corner of North Mercer and East Shenango streets, less than a half-mile from our home. There, barely able to reach the teller’s window, we would slide the contents of the box under the teller’s cage, the teller would tally the items in a little bank book, date-stamp and initial the entries and return the book to us.\nThere was a bit of irony in those regular deposits that were earned by my father’s business. In earlier years, Dad was turned down by a bank’s employee when he asked for a loan to start up his printing business. Now that Dad’s business was doing well, each deposit must have been very satisfying to him.\nJames Pierce’s Legacy\nThe Iron Banking Company building, built in 1871 by General James Pierce.\nCorner of Mercer and Shenango Streets, Sharpsville, PA.\n[Click on image for enlargement.]\nAs children, we weren’t aware that the bank building we visited, like the Pierce Mansion we passed along the way (before its demolition in 1952), was already four decades old and part of the James Pierce legacy.\nThe structure was constructed in 1871 by “General” James Pierce (1810-1874), president and principal owner of Sharpsville’s first bank, the Iron Banking Company. It was built to resemble the Italianate style of architecture popular nationwide in the mid- to late-1800s, with its rectangular shape and its row of seven tall front windows that were rounded on top. The Geddes & Pierce Foundry supplied the cast iron front of the building.\nJames Pierce’s presidency was followed by that of his son Frank (1852-1931). The Iron Banking Company was later converted to the First National Bank of Sharpsville in c. 1905. In 1964 it became a branch of the McDowell National Bank in Sharon. Later, the building housed other banking institutions, including a PNC branch until 2013. As of 2015, the first floor was occupied by Meadville Area ONE Federal Credit Union. The two brick buildings on North Mercer Avenue are now part of the Sharpsville Borough Historic District.\nThere was another reason we kids regularly visited Sharpsville’s First National Bank back in the 1950s. Hoping that we would develop a savings habit, Dad made sure we belonged to the Christmas Club, a program that banking institutions had developed to promote their services as well as holiday spending. He belonged to such a club when he was a young lad in Cleveland, Ohio, memories of which he recorded in his memoir, “Trivia & Me.” The setting was in the 1920s, a bit earlier than the Great Depression, the period Wikipedia indicates as the time the Club became widespread. Dad’s descriptions of the Christmas Club generally match those that I remember experiencing in the 1950s. He writes:\nIt was the era when banks sponsored Christmas Clubs. People — especially youth — were encouraged to deposit small amounts of money each week for 50 weeks. Banks solicited five cents or 10, 25 or 50 cents to do the double job of teaching people to save money and promoting Christmas sales for merchants. The banks would issue a passbook in which a teller would record the weekly deposits and then initial the entry. Two weeks before Christmas, one could withdraw the savings in cash (without interest) for a shopping spree. For several years I managed to join the 10 cents club and was awarded the joy of a cash harvest of $5 at Christmas time.\nEven though the interest rate was low or nonexistent and fees were charged for withdrawals, I had a feeling of accomplishment when I received that check in early December. And the Christmas Club may have contributed to the way we siblings handled our finances since then, leaning more toward careful than spendthrift. The Club exists to this day, although primarily run by credit unions.\nPierce Opera House\nFor 40 years after Pierce’s bank building was constructed the 3,000-square-foot third floor served as Sharpsville’s cultural center, having been home to the Pierce Opera House. There is limited information about the shows performed in those early days, but it is known that the organization offered a variety of musical events and featured speakers. Once motion pictures became popular, they were shown as well.\nIn addition, the two upper floors were used for high school graduations during the late 1800s until c. 1920, an occasional basketball game in the early 1900s and as a meeting place for the Order of the Eastern Star and the Masons. The building also housed the original offices of the town’s early newspaper, “The Sharpsville Advertiser,” started by Walter Pierce, James Pierce’s son. After the 1920s this floor remained unused for some time.\nIn the early 2000s, Michael G. Wilson and his family began restoring the opera house which had been left neglected behind a concealing wall for some eight or nine decades. Wilson, owner of the building since 1999, had been a longtime Borough Manager of Sharpsville who retired January 2017. The Wilson family found — and preserved — much of the opera stage’s original trappings and equipment once the wall was removed. For photos of old-time ticket booth posters and graffiti, go to Sharpsville Area Historical Society’s “Opera House Pictures.”\nWanting to see the restoration continue in good hands, Mr. Wilson sold the building to Dr. Francisco Cano, an allergist/immunologist from Greenville, PA, himself professionally trained in operatic voice. Cano’s love of opera and the arts was a driving force behind the ongoing phases of restoration designed to house theatrical, musical, and opera performances once again. The first performance of the Pierce Opera House’s revival was in 2009.\nAccording to the July 2013 SAHS Newsletter,\nThe Pierce Opera House itself is worth the visit. This historic venue features beautifully restored woodwork, excellent acoustics, and a warm intimacy between the audience and the stage. Modern climate control and conveniences have been introduced to this 142-year-old local treasure.\nThe Valley Lyric Opera, which now resides in the Pierce Opera House, provides an excellent level and variety of programs. Past performances include the operas Aida, La Traviata, La Boheme, Rigoletto; musicals [performed by the Area Community Theatre of Sharpsville — ACTS] South Pacific, Man of La Mancha, as well as ballets, musical tributes to Neil Simon and Andrew Lloyd Webber and a host of other outstanding offerings.\nPierce Opera House has once again taken its rightful place as Sharpsville’s center for the arts.

75	compare bacterial respiratory infection prevention strategies dogs humans immunization schedule	For dogs, prevention of respiratory infections relies on ventilation to dilute organisms, proper disinfection, and intranasal vaccination at 4-5 weeks old. For humans, prevention follows a standardized immunization schedule endorsed by CDC and other organizations, with DTaP vaccine recommended for protection against respiratory infections like whooping cough, with initial doses given in infancy and a booster after age 11.	"['Upper Respiratory Infections\nOut of all puppy problems, Upper Respiratory Infections (URI) is one of the most frustrating for both pet owners and veterinarians. There is no easy fix; the issue is likely to be clinical for three to six weeks with treatment, and relapses are common. To understand this disease, we must consider the conditions in which it occurs, its bacterial and viral sources, and our options for prevention and treatment.\nConditions Inside and Outside the Puppy\nURI– also called Canine Infectious Respiratory Disease (CIRD) or Infectious Respiratory Tract Disease (IRTD) - is primarily contracted in spaces occupied or visited by many dogs. Boarding houses, groomers, and dog parks, along with many other high traffic locations, provide many opportunities for exposure to URI-causing bacteria and viruses. Known commonly as ""Kennel Cough"" because of the honking, dry sound made by infected animals, URI is difficult to identify and diagnose because, while it can be caused by both bacteria and viruses independently, most cases involve multiple agents.\nUnderstanding the upper respiratory tract, where URI occurs, helps develop a more complete picture of the disease. The upper respiratory tracts of mammals contains cilia, which are finger-like projections lining the airway. These cilia have a mucus-layer surface that helps catch the ""junk"" in the air the mammal breathes in. The cilia move together, grabbing bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances from the air, and forcing them up and out the opening of the airway. This defense is often called the mucociliary escalator, as it constantly moves dirt and infection out of the respiratory area. Coughing and clearing the throat also help remove material from the respiratory surface. We will return to the cilia shortly as we consider the damage bacteria and viruses do to these internal defenses.\nBacterial Causes of URI\nBordetella is one of the few primary pathogens of respiratory tract, meaning it causes issues by itself! Related to Bordetella pertussis, which causes Whooping Cough in people, the Bordetella organism primarily spreads from dog to dog through coughing, but it can also be carried on clothing or shared in water bowls. The organism does not survive long outside the body, and exposure to most detergents, disinfectants, and sunlight kills it.\nBordetella bronchiseptica has several fibrillar appendages or spears that allow it to firmly attach to the surface lining of the nasal passage or respiratory tract after it is inhaled. Once it attaches, it releases a toxin that paralyses the cilia, neutralizing the body\'s number one defense: the mucociliary escalator. Without the mucociliary escalator, Bordetella can stay alive in the airway for as long as 14 weeks.\nA strong strain of Bordetella incubates for two to seven days and is followed by the sudden onset of an unproductive, honking, dry cough. The cough grows worse during exercise, and secondary bacteria including E-Coli, Staph, and Strep species can develop with delayed treatment or with improper antibiotic management. Without proper antibiotic and supportive care, stressed puppies often develop bronchopneumonia from Bordetella infections.\nViral Causes of URI\nAs we discussed earlier, viral and bacterial infections of the upper respiratory tract often occur together. Parainfluenza is the primary virus that causes URI, but Adeno Type II, Canine Influenza, and Distemper are also causes. After the virus enters the dog\'s body, it ""mows"" down patches of cilia, ruining the body\'s defenses. This now-raw tissue is vulnerable to other organisms, making it easy for bacteria to ""gang up"" on the puppy. The bacteria attach to the airway surface and reproduce on the damaged cilia layer. This over exposure to pathogens causes reoccurring respiratory problems and makes the infections even more difficult to treat.\nVaccinations provide insurance against disease, and keeping puppies healthy in the face of exposure is the goal. Puppies between four and five weeks old are vaccinated with the Intranasal (IN) vaccine for Kennel Cough. Once vaccinated, the immune system goes looking for the cause of respiratory irritation, even fighting off organisms not included in the vaccine. The IN vaccine for Kennel Cough creates antibodies on the lining of the respiratory tract to assist the mucociliary escalator. These antibodies help bind the bacteria and viruses, preventing them from attaching to wall of the airway. Binding the infectious organisms allows the mucociliary escalator to remove them.\nDogs recently vaccinated with IN Bordetella vaccine have less severe clinical signs when exposed to influenza virus, and this general immunity helps in an outbreak. Vaccination for URI raises the population\'s resistance and shortens the illness\'s lifespan if exposure does occur.\nPrevention is difficult, but when executed properly, URI can be a minor issue for kennels and other dog-heavy areas. Since we know high exposure to the organism is required to cause an outbreak of coughing, ventilation is the biggest defense for populations of dogs housed together. The concept is simple: dilute the organism with more air, ensuring minimal exposure when an affected dog coughs. Keeping the air moving also helps prevent additional bacteria and viruses from becoming concentrated in the area and making the existing infections difficult to clear.\nTreatmentThere is more to treatment than just antibiotics, but antibiotics are important in respiratory infections just like other infections. Effective antibiotics must pursue Bordetella and Mycoplasma.\n- Doxycycline is common and very effective against Mycoplasma and Bordetella. The once a day dose is easy to administer and does a good job protecting against the bacteria.\n- Azithromycin is the next logical move if Doxycyline doesn\'t work. This is a reserve measure, as we do not want the diseases to develop bacterial immunity to this very helpful antibiotic. Zithromax works well in severe cases.\n- Nose Drops, made with 10 cc saline solution and 100 mg Lincomycin, can be used several times a day to clean junk out of the airway and support the puppy\'s immune response. The mucus lining is mostly water, and therefore saline nose drops or nebulizers help prevent dehydration of this mucus layer and supports immune function.\n- Supportive care cannot be understated. If puppies are nutritionally challenged because they are not eating, they have little immune defense against the invading organism. Puppy Gatorade and high fat high protein baby food are good support for the tiny baby. Parasites will suppress the immune system and complicate prevention and treatment, so it is vital to make sure your puppy is parasite-free.\nRespiratory issues are a big concern between weaning and moving the puppies to their ""forever home""! Once a puppy is coughing, it can take three to six weeks to totally resolve the issue. Remember to start a prevention plan including ventilation, disinfection, and vaccination, and your care will successfully move a litter from nursing mom to their next best friend!\nIf you need help, call us at 800.786.4751.\nDon Bramlage, DVM, Former Director of Veterinary Services at Revival Animal Health\nThe materials, information and answers provided through this website are not intended to replace the medical advice or services of your personal veterinarian or other pet health care professional. Consult your own veterinarian for answers to specific medical questions, including diagnosis, treatment, therapy or medical attention.', 'What is the recommended vaccine schedule?\nOur clinic follows the standard immunization schedule endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control, American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Practice. These are available at AAP Immunization page.\nWe strongly recommend that your child receive vaccines according to the recommended schedule in order to provide your child with the strongest protections against these diseases at the earliest possible age. “Alternative” immunization schedules are non-standard have no basis in science and leave your child vulnerable to serious diseases for an extended period of time.\nDiphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine\nWhooping cough is a very dangerous disease, especially for infants. The risk of suffering and death caused by whooping cough is far greater than the possible side effects of the vaccine. A child who has not been immunized against pertussis has a chance of 1 in 3000 of getting whooping cough. In contrast, a child who got the vaccine has a chance of 1 in 2 million of having an serious adverse effect from the vaccine. The risk of children getting pertussis increases if fewer children in the community are immunized. A booster is recommend after age 11. Beginning in 2005 the booster (previously only containing tetanus and diphtheria) now contains a reduced dose of pertussis antigen to protect teenagers and those around them from whooping cough. Parents of young children should also make sure that they are vaccinated with this new booster, especially if a baby is on the way!\nMeasles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine\nMeasles continues to be a serious disease in other countries and easily imported into our country. Children should have the first shot when they are 12 to 15 months old and the second when they are 4 to 6 years old. These diseases are nearly gone from the U.S. However, they will come back if children are not fully vaccinated.\nHaemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine\nHaemophilus influenzae is a type of bacteria that causes several life-threatening diseases in young children (such as meningitis, epiglottitis, and pneumonia). Before the vaccine was available, over 10,000 children in the U.S. developed haemophilus meningitis each year. About 500 of them died and 3800 became mentally retarded, blind, or deaf, or got cerebral palsy as a result of the disease. Because of the vaccine, haemophilus influenzae type B is now uncommon in the U.S. The Hib vaccine does not protect against respiratory flu (influenza) and meningitis caused by viruses.\nHepatitis B vaccine (Hep B)\nVaccination against hepatitis B prevents this type of hepatitis and the severe liver damage that can occur 20 or 30 years after a person is first infected. More than 5000 adults die each year in the U.S. from hepatitis-related liver cancer or cirrhosis. The younger the age when the infection occurs, the greater the risk of serious problems.\nThe polio vaccine protects children from this now rare but crippling disease. The inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is now recommended for all polio doses.\nChickenpox (Varicella) vaccine\nThe chickenpox vaccine is usually given between the ages of 12 and 18 months, but it can be given to older children if they have not had the vaccine or the disease yet. Children age 13 or older should get 2 doses at least 4 weeks apart.\nThis vaccine is 70% to 90% effective in preventing chickenpox. If vaccinated children get chickenpox, they have a much milder form of the disease. By being vaccinated, you can reduce the chance of missed work and school, skin infections, medical costs, and getting shingles later in life.\nPneumococcal (PCV13) vaccine\nPneumococcal infections are serious bacterial infections that may cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and meningitis. The PCV13 vaccine protects against the 7 types of pneumococcal bacteria that cause most of these serious diseases. The vaccine also prevents a small percentage of ear infections caused by pneumococci.\nRoutine use of PCV13 is recommended for all infants and toddlers less than 2 years old. Some children (up to age 5) who have a serious illness may benefit from the vaccine.\nThe newest vaccine in the schedule is the rotavirus oral vaccine. Rotavirus is a viral cause of severe vomiting and diarrhea. It is not the only cause of viral “stomach flu” but it is the most severe. The use of the vaccine will reduce infections caused by rotavirus that often result in hospitalization and prolonged illness.\nThis is recommended for infants only. There is no catch-up recommended.\nHepatitis A vaccine (HAV)\nThe hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for children and adolescents in selected states and regions, and for certain people at high-risk. Talk to your health care provider or local public health department for more information.\nHealthy children age 6 to 23 months are recommended to get the influenza vaccine because they are at a greater risk of getting severely ill or needing to go to the hospital because of the flu. The influenza vaccine is also recommended each year for children ages 6 months and older if they have certain medical risk factors. The vaccine can also be given to anyone wanting immunity. Talk to your health care provider for more information.\nMeningococcal vaccine (MCV4)\nMeningococcal bacteriacauses “purple spots” on the skin, severe blood infections and meningitis. Vaccine has been available since 2005 that protects against 4 types of this bacteria. It is recommended beginning at 11 years old with a booster in the 16 to 18 year age group.\nHuman Papilloma Virus (HPV)\nThe latest addition to the schedule is a vaccine for the prevention of cervical cancer. The majority of cervical cancers are linked to infection by human papilloma virus. This is a sexually transmitted infection. The vaccine is a three dose series recommended for middle schoolers beginning at age 11. The initial recommendation was for girls only but in 2010 the recommendation was expanded to include boys. If the vaccine is given prior to the initiation of sexual activity it is very effective in preventing the majority of cervical cancers and genital warts.\nOther vaccinations required for international travel\nThere are many additional vaccines that are recommended for travel to certain countries that are not part of the routine vaccination schedule. An excellent resource is the CDC travel information.\nThe physicians of Childhood Health Associates are all strong believers in the benefits of vaccination in the prevention of serious infectious diseases.\nThimerisol (mercury containing preservative)\nIn 2000 the FDA reviewed all pharmaceuticals to evaluate for possible mercury exposures and calculated that with all vaccines currently recommended the possible exposure could exceed a level set for safety. An additional concern was also the potential increase in mercury in the environment from disposal of vaccine containers. No direct links with any diseases or developmental problems have ever been discovered; however, the decision was made to promptly reformulate vaccines to NOT contain that preservative any longer. All vaccines used by Childhood Health Associates, except for some forms of the influenza vaccine for older children, are free of thimerasol and have been so since 1998. However, long-term population studies continue to show no relationship between the old thimerosol-containing vaccines and any increase in neuro-developmental problems.\nMMR and Autism\nDr. Andrew Wakefield published an article in 1998 about a small series of patients he had studied. His researched purported to show a higher level of measles antibodies in the intestinal tract of children with autism and theorized a causal link between MMR and autism. Since then the journal that published the article (the Lancet) as well as all authors (except for Dr. Wakefield himself) on the original article have retracted the article as poor science and frankly fraudulent. Dr. Wakefield’s license to practice medicine in the UK has been revoked. Multiple studies since then looking at large populations of children have not found any association between MMR vaccine and autism. These are done by looking at changes in vaccination rates (either increase or decrease) and compare to changes in rates of autism. The Institute of Medicine as well as numerous medical organizations have reviewed all available studies and not found any link between MMR (or any other) vaccine and autism.\nWhat shots does my child need for school in Oregon?\nShots required are the same as recommended on the shot schedule for kids entering kindergarten. The newest vaccines including meningococcal and HPV are not yet required for school participation.\nWhere can I get more information about vaccinations?\nIn the office we are required to make available information sheets about all the vaccines given in the clinic. These can be viewed fromimmunize.org which has multiple languages available.']"	['<urn:uuid:99ffe183-73e0-4081-b4cf-1279c5dce25a>', '<urn:uuid:cbe19629-e667-489a-b63a-4b8800955d20>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	10	59	2606

On the positive side, music strengthens cognitive abilities, improves memory recall, and enhances social bonding through activities like choir singing and band playing. However, there are significant risks associated with unsafe listening practices. Studies show that over 1 billion young people worldwide are at risk of permanent hearing loss from exposure to loud music, particularly through personal listening devices and noisy venues. Sound levels above 85 decibels can cause hearing damage with prolonged exposure, and immediate harm can occur at levels above 120 decibels. This is particularly concerning as 24% of young people listen to music too loudly on their devices, and 48% attend potentially harmful noisy venues.	"[""Music is a part of daily life for many people, transcending personal circumstances, national borders, and even language. The oldest instruments discovered to date - flutes made of mammoth ivory and bird bone - are more than 40,000 years old, signifying that the human relationship to music has a long and storied past.\nThough there is no specific center of the brain where music is processed, its effects on the human mind are wide and varied. These effects extend beyond cognition to impact people of all ages in an array of surprising ways. Outlined below are seven of the most surprising, science-backed ways that music has an effect on people.\n1. Music strengthens cognitive abilities and motor skills.\nPeople who practice an instrument from an early age benefit significantly in the form of improved cognitive abilities. These benefits may include better visual and verbal skills, as well as advanced spatial processing.\nNot only that, but researchers have also established a connection between music and well-developed language skills. Additionally, overall better academic performance and IQ scores have been exhibited in school-aged children who practice instruments.\nThese cognitive benefits are not limited to children, however. Listening to music while completing tasks has been shown to improve memory recall and processing speed in adults who are older as well.\n2. Music is addictive in a way similar to food.\nScience shows that music has an addictive quality comparable to that of food and other addictive actions or items. When someone listens to a song, the brain’s reward system reacts, creating an emotional arousal and releasing a “pleasure chemical” known as dopamine from the striatum during peak moments.\nThose who find joy in music are likely familiar with a sensation of shivers or chills physically experienced in the body when a piece of music hits its most pleasurable bars. This sensation, known as frisson, occurs when dopamine is released from the brain’s ventral striatum, a neurological process similar to the one experienced by those who are addicted to certain chemical substances.\n3. Different music genres and types have different psychological impacts.\nDifferent genres of music actually provide people with different mental benefits. For example, the sultry downbeats of smooth jazz have a calming, relaxing effect on the mind, while the narrative themes often present in rap songs may help listeners deal with the effects of depression.\nIn addition, some studies indicate that a person’s taste in music may be a strong indicator of his or her personality type. One study from 2006 showed that an individual’s list of top 10 favorite songs could reasonably be used to determine that person’s level of openness to experience, agreeableness, extraversion, emotional stability, and conscientiousness.\n4. Music improves social bonding.\nIn addition to providing insight into people’s personalities, music can be a useful tool in facilitating bonds between them. Attempting to synchronize musically with others, whether through beat or harmony, has been shown to encourage positive feelings between people. Alternatively, playing instruments in a band or singing with others in a choir requires a cooperation that generates trust.\nResearch has also shown that the area of the brain linked to empathy is triggered by music. This allows people to be more understanding of, and sympathetic to, others. Within a social group, listening to music together has proven to be positively correlated with social cohesion, such as that which takes place in family or peer group settings. Appreciating the same song as another person also tends to increase the likelihood that we feel affection toward them. This may be because musical tastes are seen as communicating personal values which we may have in common with others.\n5. Music can improve your mental state.\nMusic is known to have psychotherapeutic benefits as well. Listening to particular songs can help reduce stress levels in people living with anxiety by triggering the release of biochemical stress reducers. Music also induces a therapeutic, hypnotic state that eases the symptoms of migraines.\nFor those who struggle with depression, certain genres of music - like meditative and classical - can instill uplifting feelings, leading to alleviation of the disorder’s symptoms. In general, music can also be used to elevate mood and connect people to emotions, regulating their moods and making them more self-aware.\n6. Music can boost a workout.\nIndividuals looking to add a little more power to their daily workouts can use music to boost endurance. One study showed that those who synchronized the movements of their fitness routines with music were able to perform for longer periods of time.\nCyclists who listen to fast-paced music were more likely to bike harder while riding stationary bicycle equipment. Runners were shown to run faster and feel a greater degree of motivation. Research suggests that this phenomenon is due, in part, to our mental distraction from the exercise while listening to an enjoyable song.\n7. Music can reduce the sensation of physical pain.\nPerhaps one of the most remarkable benefits that music has to offer is its ability to reduce the levels of pain felt by people who have conditions like osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and disc problems. Some people choose to use music as an assistive treatment for chronic pain. Additionally, some women are opting to use music therapy during childbirth as a way to reduce the use of pain-reducing drugs.\nScientists have not determined the exact cause behind music’s ability to soothe those in pain. However, some professionals suggest that these effects may stem from music's tendency to trigger the release of endorphins, relax the breath and slow the heartbeat, and provide patients with some semblance of control in difficult situations."", 'Statistics Show Nearly One Billion Young People at Risk for Hearing Loss\nWhether you blast music in your headphones or watch movies with spatial audio, you may want to reduce the volume. That’s because lowering the volume by a couple of notches could protect your ears and prevent hearing loss, according to a recent study published in the journal BMJ Global Health.1\nThe study found that more than 1 billion adolescents and young people worldwide could be at risk for developing permanent hearing loss from exposure to common and unsafe listening practices.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said more than 1.5 billion people worldwide currently live with hearing loss, and that number could reach over 2.5 billion by 2050.2\n“This supports the need to implement strategies to prevent hearing loss, which can occur by individuals making simple modifications to make their listening habits safe and through government and industry support in implementing policies focused on safe listening,” Lauren Dillard, AuD, PhD, lead author of the study and a WHO consultant, told Verywell in an email.\nDillard and her colleagues analyzed data from other studies published between 2000 and 2021 which examined personal listening devices and unsafe listening practices.\nThe analysis included 33 studies involving about 19,000 people between the ages of 12 to 34. About 24% of young people listened to music too loudly from their phones or music players, while 48% attended noisy venues that could impact their hearing. In addition, the researchers concluded that the number of young people at risk of hearing loss from exposure to these unsafe listening practices ranges between 0.67 to 1.35 billion.\nWhat Is Considered a Dangerous Noise Level?\nSound is measured in units called decibels (dB). The higher the decibel level, the louder the noise is.3 For example, normal conversations can range from 60 to 70 dB, whereas a motorcycle engine, sporting event, or concert can range from 95 to 110 dB.4\nThe National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders recommends keeping sounds at or below 70 dB. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds and noises at or above 85 dB could cause hearing loss.3 In addition, loud noise above 120 dB can cause immediate harm to your ears.4\nOver the course of an eight-hour day, the average noise level should not be more than 85 dB, per the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Additionally, sounds that are 100 dB should not be listened to for more than 15 minutes.\nWhy Are Younger People at Higher Risk of Hearing Loss?\nYounger people are particularly vulnerable to hearing loss because of their frequent use of personal listening devices, such as smartphones, headphones, and speakers, according to Viral Tejani, AuD, PhD, an audiologist and assistant professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.\nAdolescents and young adults are also more likely to visit entertainment venues, nightclubs, concerts, movies, and sporting events. Engaging in these activities places them at risk of developing hearing loss early in life.\n“What can occur as a result of attending these events is a temporary threshold shift,” Tejani told Verywell in an email. “There is a temporary decline in hearing that recovers. However, this recovery isn’t really a true recovery.”\nTejani explained that sounds are funneled to the sensory cells—also called hair cells—in the hearing system. These hair cells are responsible for sending to our brain through complex pathways. However, “our hair cells are not always going to be resilient—repeated noise exposure will eventually compromise our hair cell function and lead to diminished hearing ability,” he said.\nLoud noise exposure can also cause tinnitus—a ringing, humming, crackling, or roaring in the ears. It can occur along with hearing loss.5\nWhat Can You Do to Prevent Hearing Loss?\nYou can still enjoy listening to music while protecting your hearing, experts say. Here are some recommendations:\n- Keep the volume of devices down (a rough estimate is below 60% of the maximum volume).\n- Try noise-canceling headphones to reduce background noise, so there is less of a need to increase the volume of the device to overcome the background noise.\n- Use disposable earplugs in loud music venues, concerts, or sporting events, and position yourself further away from the speakers.\n- Limit the amount of time you spend doing noisy activities. For example, listen to music from your device for less time per day and take breaks away from loud sounds when at an entertainment venue.\n- Monitor your listening levels through built-in safe listening features on your phones or consider sound level meter apps that can quickly measure sound levels in your environment.\n- Pay attention to warning signs of hearing loss, including ringing or buzzing in your ears and difficulties hearing high-pitched sounds or following conversations.\nIf you’re concerned about hearing loss or want to know ways to reduce your risk of hearing loss, have a conversation with your healthcare provider.\nArticle originally appeared on VeryWell']"	['<urn:uuid:d8e430ac-ec33-46f0-b8f6-c84374dfe3f3>', '<urn:uuid:7bfc18f6-7853-46e1-bcb4-38dc1dfa0c21>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	5	118	1758
77	compare value impact damaged items antique porcelain vase condition	Both antique porcelain and vases are significantly affected by their condition, with damage reducing their value. For porcelain, broken or damaged items, or abraded decorations decrease value even if the item is rare, though some exceptions exist - particularly for Ming dynasty pieces where minor damage is more acceptable than in later periods. For antique vases, those that are whole and unbroken are worth more than pieces with cracks or that have been broken and repaired. The condition factor is crucial for both types, as collectors generally prefer items in good condition for display and investment purposes.	"[""The value of\nantiques is affected by several factors. Like any other\nmerchandise antique china value is subject to the demand and supply situation. Antiques that are\nhighly sought after but are scarce can usually command a better\nIn individual situations another\nfactor is the value attributed to a specific antique by its owner, and the\nprice other collectors are willing to pay for it to obtain it for their collection. In other words, this is dependent on the demand and supply situation on the antique market.\nTherefore, the actual value of an antique may never be the same at two points in time, or in two or more different sales locations.\nChinese Ceramics, Pottery, Porcelain\nThe following are\ndecisive factors applying to value of antiques in general and/or antique china. (See details below)\n* Can be relevant with Chinese ceramics. Items from mainstream kilns generally command a higher value.\nThis is especially important with the ceramics of the Song and Yuan dynasties.\nSelling/purchasing location affects price:\nThe type of location or business where antiques are traded also influences the antique china value. High-end or low-end antiques are usually only available in certain locations where their high respectively low prices and the related quality are acceptable to their respective customers. Antiques valued in the medium range might be available in both.\nMany of the larger auction houses now allow online bidding in addition\nto in-house bidding. With some it is also possible to watch the auction process live, online.\nAs of now 2020/2021 many auction houses shift to a greater online auction presence and bidding online is becoming more common.\nDetails of factors affecting the value of antiques:\nThe age of a porcelain item may affect price, but not the way some novice collectors may think.\nOften age is affecting price only with medium or high quality antiques. For example, crude porcelain used by the common folks five hundred or a thousand years ago mau sometimes even have less value than an item of better quality made in the 19th century. Pottery items from the Han dynasty or earlier, more than 2000 years ago, are suitable for a museum, but may not necessarily interest a private collector. They are a milestone of human history, but not of an app ealing appearance. An appealing appearance is one of the requirements porcelain collectors have.\nQuality of work and\nCollectors do prefer a nice appearance, an elaborate painted decoration or interesting glaze to a roughly painted or plain color item. After all, it shall be presented in vitrines or on shelves to visitors and other collectors, of just are for pleasing the collector him/herself. Imperial wares are the best of the times they were made in, both in view to quality and workmanship. Some private kilns also were able to produce such high-quality wares. Export porcelain made in the 17th to 19th centuries often ranges somewhere in between the common wares and imperial porcelain in this respect, but they are more affordable.\nRare porcelain items may command a higher price than more common wares, no matter how old they are, but they still are subject to quality requirements. Even rare items are only valuable if their workmanship is good enough to appeal to collectors. Items that are related to or once belonged to famous persons may be more valuable.\nIt is only natural that the condition of an item affects its value. Broken or damaged items, or an abraded on-glaze decoration will reduce value even if an item is rare. Severely damaged items may be normal in a museum, but should be the exception in a private collection.\nNotable is, however, that rare or very old items that are desirable to collectors may still have value, some are even auctioned. For example, items made in the Kangxi reign are considered highly collectable in China, and Chinese collectors will pay fairly high prices for genuine but slightly damaged Kangxi items.\nThe more demand there is for an item the higher its value rises; but this depends also on whether the supply is small or more than sufficient. In the latter case the value of an antique will likely remain low.\nManufacturer or kiln\nThis is more important with pre-Ming porcelain. Items of the more widely known kilns, or those which manufacturing for the imperial court, respectively, would command a higher price, depending on other circumstances above.\nIn the Ming and Qing dynasties items manufactured at the imperial kiln in Jingdezhen would be valued most, then the other kilns at Jingdezhen and Dehua kiln, probably. This does not exclude exceptional items of other, non-mainstream kilns.\nExport porcelain painted in Canton may be different. Those porcelains were first fired in Jingdezhen and the blanks then transported to Canton, where they were decorated and then exported.\nItem Condition, Rarity and Age:\nWith porcelain the value of antiques is also affected by their condition, the same way as with other antiques. However, age and rarity may lead to exceptional acceptance of minor damage by collectors.\nThis is especially the case with Chinese porcelain. Minor damage of Ming dynasty (1368~1644) porcelain, for example, is often more acceptable than if the same condition were found in late Qing dynasty (1644~1911) or republican porcelain.\nWhile minor damage also decreases the value of antique Ming items somewhat, if compared to similar Ming pieces in perfect state, slight damage appears to be more acceptable than with the much 'younger' Qing dynasty and later porcelains.\nDue to the scarcity of good Ming items the overall antique china value of slightly damaged Ming items is often perceived as higher than that of equivalent but more recent porcelain items in perfect state.\nBut, it is wrong to assume that the higher the age of an antique, the more it is worth. Age always goes hand in hand with quality when it comes to pricing.\nA finely worked or decorated antique that is only a hundred years old may be valued higher by collectors than a simple, utilitarian item with little decoration, that was made several hundred years ago. Sometimes, even if quality is approximately the same, the older item may have a lower collecting value than one that is less old, but rare.Sometimes collectors specialized on a certain category of antiques may will pass the opportunity of an older item in order to obtain that rare, difficult-to-find object still missing in his/her collection.\nCollectors in China have a tendency to collect Chinese taste porcelain (porcelain made primarily for use in China). They generally value export porcelain less, although in recent years demand for it has been rising, due to insufficient availability of quality domestic porcelain.\nWestern collectors, on the other hand, are readily collecting plates, which are usually the farthest down on the wish list of Chinese collectors. In China decorative items like vases, jars, pots, etc. are most sought after. Using plates for decoration purposes was relatively unknown until more recent times. There is a second reason to this: plates (dishes) and bowls are more plenty, as people have always needed such items for eating, etc., while decorative porcelain may not have been affordable by many, in the old times. This also reflects in its pricing - again, this situation appears to be changing slowly."", ""Antique vase collecting can be satisfying on a number of personal levels. Many people collect them simply because they are beautiful, and do not worry too much about whether they could be profitable from an investment standpoint. This may be the best reason of all to buy antique vases and other antique glassware: to enjoy it for its intrinsic beauty.\nOthers may collect antique vases because of an interest in a particular period of history, or for the fact that they are rare, providing a beautiful but fragile link with a specific time or place.\nAntique vase value: age\n- The appraised value of an antique vase depends on several factors, and age is not necessarily the dominant one.\n- One example of relatively newer glassware being potentially more valuable than older glassware is Depression-era glassware.\n- This type of glassware is valuable because it is fragile, and it isn't always easy to find pieces that have remained intact.\n- Conversely, there is older glassware that is sturdier and easier to find, and it is therefore less expensive than Depression-era antique vases.\nAge usually combines with other factors to influence the monetary value of an antique vase. One-of-a-kind, handmade vases that are old will generally be worth more than comparable-quality vases that are mass-produced and newer.\nAntique vase value: purpose and quantity\nThe purpose that an antique vase performed in its historical time period is one factor influencing its value. Was it used to hold flowers, or did it have a more unusual purpose (such as holding cremated ashes or functioning as a spittoon)? Was the vase mass produced by a manufacturer that is still producing glassware today? Or is it a product of a single artisan or of a manufacturer that is no longer in existence? Typically, the more limited the quantities that were produced, the more valuable an antique vase will be, though this is not an iron-clad rule.\nAntique vase value: condition\nAn antique vase that is whole and unbroken will be worth more than a piece with a crack, or a piece that has been broken and put back together. Many valuable pieces of antique glassware or antique vases will have a mark on them indicating the manufacturer. Some will have a year marked, or some other indicator that makes them easy to verify in terms of manufacturer and date of production.\nIf you are considering buying a piece of antique glassware, particularly if you are partly or wholly buying it as an investment that you hope will increase in monetary value, then you should have the piece of glassware appraised. Find out if there is any kind of market for it if you think you may want to sell it later. Use an independent appraiser who has experience and / or certification in appraising antique vases.\nAntique vases can be a wonderful type of antique to collect. Examples are available that are very beautiful and affordable to those who are interested in mid-priced antiques. Furthermore they are far easier to transport and display than enormous pieces of antique furniture. While most people who buy antique vases are interested in their investment value, they also have a real appreciation for the great intrinsic, aesthetic value that many an antique vase possesses.\nFind out about Boningtons glass antique vase auctions.""]"	['<urn:uuid:d4dade81-4a83-4f0b-8006-ef7af7be839c>', '<urn:uuid:0a2f4b36-6cfc-40b7-b197-522663045e81>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	9	97	1763
78	compare storing books temperature vs neptune core heat storage	Books are stored on bookshelves at normal room temperature, serving as decorative and functional storage units in homes. In contrast, Neptune's core exhibits remarkably high temperatures - hot enough to melt rock - and stores an enormous amount of internal heat. In fact, Neptune generates 2.6 times more energy than it receives from the Sun, causing it to glow even without solar input. While bookshelves serve as static storage units at constant temperatures, Neptune's heat storage drives dynamic processes, creating temperature differentials that result in extreme wind speeds of up to 2,100 km/hour across its surface layers.	"['© Luisa Brimble | Photography as noted.\nAges ago, the Greek philosopher Epictetus called books “the training weights of the mind.”\nAnd if books fulfill this role of weights that strengthen our minds, then bookshelves would be our literary home gyms that store and categorize our paperbacks and hardbacks. But in the twenty-first century, they do so much more.\nThis has been made evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many people began working from home more frequently. Whether you’ve been in meetings with coworkers or watching podcasts or interviews on TV, you likely noticed that many people positioned themselves in front of their home library or chose a bookshelf background filter. In no time, bookshelves had become a hot decor accessory.\nThese pieces of furniture have always told a story, but the story is very different today. The books and other items they hold reveal something about the person who owns them, whether it’s their literary chops or a glimpse into their personality.\nA Bookshelf Preface\nIf you’re considering adding a bookshelf to your home, it’s important to establish where you’ll utilize it, how you’ll do so, and what you’ll want your bookshelf to say. But first, you have to decide which type suits you and your space best.\nFlexibility is the primary benefit of standalone versions, as they are more affordable and can be moved around a room, within a home, and from home to home. The upside of built-ins is that they can give you a good return on investment (ROI) because they’re eye-catching and space-saving.\nAccording to experts, you should treat your bookshelf much like you would any other piece of furniture, so decide which room it will be in (if it’s a movable object), take a step back, look at the overall space with the empty bookshelf in it, and gauge how it would fit best.\nFor example, ask yourself if the bookshelf color matches the room’s overall palette. If it doesn’t, you may want to paint it to complement the rest of your decor. In addition, a hot trend is to maximize unused spaces, such as an understairs area, by adding built-in bookshelves to them.\nNow that you’ve determined where your shelving unit will be and how it will fit into the room, you need to ask yourself about form and function: what’s your purpose for this piece of furniture? It could simply be a place to store books and other items that would otherwise clutter your home, but it can also serve many other functions.\nThe key is being intentional with the objects that will go onto the shelves. Let’s start by discussing the star of this show, your books. Some fundamental questions will immediately pop into your head, such as Which should I select? How many are too many? and How\nshould I arrange them?\nKeep in mind that, through your choice of books, you’ll be making yourself, your interests, and even your beliefs somewhat of an open book. So perhaps you want to highlight your love of classics, books by your favorite author, or only books you’ve read. You could always do all three by dedicating a shelf to each.\nAnd, yes, people sometimes have nothing but books on their shelves. If your paperbacks and hardbacks are your sole decor tool, decide how you want them to look overall by considering your organization. For example, you could group your books by size, with smaller, lighter paperbacks on higher shelves and heavier hardbacks on lower shelves for practicality.\nYou may also wonder if they should be stacked vertically or horizontally. Why not both? When you have some areas with books upright and others laid down, it adds interest and prevents your furniture from looking like a library.\nYou could also choose to separate colors on different shelves, or you could opt to only display books that match the color surrounding the bookshelf: for example, blue books to match the blue wall paint behind it. Another trend is to reverse the books so that the pages are facing outward, thus guaranteeing a consistent white/neutral palette (but this tends to fall into the love-it-or-hate-it category).\nPerhaps most important is the focal point. Much like you should do with artwork, you should keep the books you want people to see first at eye level.\nIf your books are going to tell a story, what accompanies them on your shelves will as well. You could add any number of items to enhance your bookshelf aesthetic. Here are just a few examples of how to go about it.\n• Plants are a popular choice for bookshelves. Placing a small plant or two on shelves will add not only a natural touch but also a pop of color.\n• People often think that bookends are only for desks, but they can also be bookshelf statement pieces. For example, if you love reading about dogs, group your canine-themed books on one shelf with dog bookends.\n• Choose a basket that matches the bookshelf’s overall theme, which can serve as a convenient place to store blankets or your kids’ toys. Keep it on a low shelf for easy access.\n• Don’t forget about the books themselves. A few stacked books could hold a favorite knickknack; for example, you could have a family vacation photo resting atop a few travel books.\n• Utilize the inside back of your bookshelf as an accessory unto itself. You could add contact paper to this area so that your personal style is on display behind your books. Or, if you have white built-ins, you could paint this area a bright color for more pop.\n• Overall, balance is key to a good bookshelf, so you may want to be somewhat of a minimalist. Accessories can blend with your books to create an overall aesthetic, but they shouldn’t overwhelm them. That said, be you! It’s fine if you’re a maximalist at heart, as long as you’re organized about it.\nSomeone once pondered anonymously, “What is a bookshelf other than a treasure chest for a curious mind?” In 2022, this is even truer, both for bookshelf owners and their audiences. Whether you see a bookshelf as merely functional furniture or a personal literary or fashion statement, one thing is for sure: it’s a great way for people to read more about you.', ""As a gas giant (or ice giant), Neptune has no solid surface. In fact, the blue-green disc we have all seen in photographs over the years is actually a bit of an illusion. What we see is actually the tops of some very deep gas clouds, which in turn give way to water and other melted ices that lie over an approximately Earth-size core made of silicate rock and a nickel-iron mix. If a person were to attempt to stand on Neptune, they would sink through the gaseous layers.\nAs they descended, they would experience increased temperatures and pressures until they finally touched down on the solid core itself. That being said, Neptune does have a surface of sorts, (as with the other gas and ice giants) which is defined by astronomers as being the point in the atmosphere where the pressure reaches one bar. Because of this, Neptune’s surface is one of the most active and dynamic places in entire the Solar System.\nComposition and Structure:\nWith a mean radius of 24,622 ± 19 km, Neptune is the fourth largest planet in the Solar System. But with a mass of 1.0243 × 1026 kg – which is roughly 17 times that of Earth – it is the third most massive, outranking Uranus. Due to its smaller size and higher concentrations of volatiles relative to Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune (much like Uranus) is often referred to as an “ice giant” – a subclass of a giant planet.\nAs with Uranus, the absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane is part of what gives Neptune its blue hue, although Neptune’s is darker and more vivid. Because Neptune’s atmospheric methane content is similar to that of Uranus, some unknown atmospheric constituent is thought to contribute to Neptune’s more intense coloring.\nAlso like Uranus, Neptune’s internal structure is differentiated between a rocky core consisting of silicates and metals; a mantle consisting of water, ammonia and methane ices; and an atmosphere consisting of hydrogen, helium and methane gas. It’s atmosphere is also divided into four layers, consisting of (from innermost to outermost) the lower troposphere, the stratosphere, the thermosphere and the exosphere.\nThe two main regions of Neptune’s atmosphere are the two innermost ones: the lower troposhere, where temperatures decrease with altitude; and the stratosphere, where temperature increases with altitude. Within the troposphere, pressure levels range from one to five bars (100 and 500 kPa), hence the surface of Neptune is defined as being within this region.\nNeptune’s “surface” can therefore be said to be composed of about 80% hydrogen and 19% helium, with a trace amount of methane. The surface layer is also permeated by roving bands of clouds with varying compositions, depending on altitude and pressure. At the upper-level, temperatures are suitable for methane to condense, and the pressure conditions are such that clouds consisting of ammonia, ammonium sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and water can exist.\nAt lower levels, clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are thought to form. Deeper clouds of water ice should be also found in the lower regions of the troposphere, where pressures of about 50 bars (5.0 MPa) and temperature of 273 K (0 °C) are common.\nFor reasons that remain obscure, the planet’s thermosphere experiences unusually high temperatures of about 750 K (476.85 °C/890 °F). The planet is too far from the Sun for this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation, which means another heating mechanism is involved – which could be the atmosphere’s interaction with ion’s in the planet’s magnetic field, or gravity waves from the planet’s interior that dissipate in the atmosphere.\nBecause Neptune is not a solid body, its atmosphere undergoes differential rotation. The wide equatorial zone rotates with a period of about 18 hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet’s magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12 hours.\nThis differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System, and results in strong latitudinal wind shear and violent storms. The three most impressive were all spotted in 1989 by the Voyager 2 space probe, and then named based on their appearances.\nThe first to be spotted was a massive anticyclonic storm measuring 13,000 x 6,600 km and resembling the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. Known as the Great Dark Spot, this storm was not spotted five later (Nov. 2nd, 1994) when the Hubble Space Telescope looked for it. Instead, a new storm that was very similar in appearance was found in the planet’s northern hemisphere, suggesting that these storms have a shorter life span than Jupiter’s\nThe Scooter is another storm, a white cloud group located farther south than the Great Dark Spot. This nickname first arose during the months leading up to the Voyager 2 encounter in 1989, when the cloud group was observed moving at speeds faster than the Great Dark Spot. The Small Dark Spot, a southern cyclonic storm, was the second-most-intense storm observed during the 1989 encounter. It was initially completely dark; but as Voyager 2 approached the planet, a bright core developed and could be seen in most of the highest-resolution images.\nFor reasons that astronomers are still not clear on, the interior of Neptune is unusually hot. Even though Neptune is much further from the Sun than Uranus and receives 40% less sunlight, its surface temperature is about the same. In fact, Neptune gives off 2.6 times more energy than it takes in from the Sun. Even without the Sun, Neptune glows.\nThis high amount of interior heat matched with the coldness of space creates a huge temperature difference. And this sets the winds blasting around Neptune. Maximum wind speeds on Jupiter can be more than 500 km/hour. That’s twice the speed of the strongest hurricanes on Earth. But that’s nothing compared to Neptune. Astronomers have calculated winds blasting across the surface of Neptune at 2,100 km/hour.\nDeep down inside Neptune, the planet might have an actual solid surface. At the very core of the gas/ice giant is thought to be a region of rock with roughly the mass of the Earth. But temperatures at this region would be thousands of degrees; hot enough to melt rock. And the pressure from the weight of all the atmosphere would be crushing.\nIn short, there is simply no way one could stand on the “surface of Neptune”, let alone walk around on it.\natmosphere, atmosphere layers, atmosphere of neptune, core, gas giant, great dark spot, ice giant, Jupiter's great red spot, mantle, Neptune, scooter, small dark spot, surface, surface of Neptune, surface temperature of Neptune, Voyager 2""]"	['<urn:uuid:6cc61a2c-c4b6-43df-9698-052474e96ad2>', '<urn:uuid:150e5e94-8a31-43dc-975b-51e8b9274210>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	9	97	2162
79	What affects tomato health more: soil replacement or marigold protection?	Both methods contribute to tomato health in different ways. Soil replacement, done every other year with fresh garden soil, helps discourage the accumulation of diseases and pests, reduces the need for crop rotation, and can increase yields. Meanwhile, marigold protection works through multiple mechanisms - their roots produce nematode-killing substances, their pungent smell deters larger pests like bugs, whiteflies, birds, and rabbits, and they help with pollination by attracting bees. While soil replacement directly addresses the growing medium's health, marigolds provide ongoing active protection against various threats. Neither method alone is definitively superior, as they address different aspects of plant health.	['Raised Bed Rotation and Rejuvination\nBy: Maureen Gilmer\nMothers always admonish us “not to hang out the dirty laundry”, which is code speak for keeping unpleasant family secrets out of neighborhood gossip. This same problem is afflicting the raised bed garden world where nobody wants to hear the downside of these tiny plots of food plants. At the heart of it is the very old concept of crop rotation. Even the ancients knew that crops grown in the same place year after year developed big problems without rotation.\nWhy Rotate Crops?\nThe science is quite simple because diseases and pests can accumulate every year you cultivate a small vegetable garden. It may not be visible the first or even the second year, but by year three it can strike with a vengeance. This is how long it takes for your soil to foster a killer dose of pests and pathogens.\nImagine a 4-foot-by-8-foot planting area (the size of a typical raised bed) that you grow tomatoes in year after year. A mature tomato can occupy half that square footage, with its roots fanning out over the area underground. To properly rotate your crops, you must not grow tomatoes in the same place you did the previous year. In this case, the only choice is to plant on the opposite end of the raised bed. That leaves only two possible spots for the tomatoes.\nFarmers know to rotate their fields over four years to ensure healthy crops. That’s four entirely different growing areas for crops in the course of four years; three years with the crop being grown in a different spot and a fourth year for a given growing area to lay fallow to “rest”. But farmers have space for rotation. What about home gardeners working within the confines to small raised beds? Without sufficient space for rotation, the results can be devastating.\nFor example, a microscopic pest called root-knot nematode often strikes when tomatoes are grown in the same location or very close-by year after year. This pest is invisible to the eye and is common to most soils but present in such small numbers that it doesn’t cause serious problems. But when tomato crops are not rotated, these nematodes multiply to fatal proportions. As a result, tomato plants begin to turn yellow and die because too many nematodes have invaded their roots. No matter how much you water or fertilize, nothing will change this downward spiral.\nYou won’t know the cause until you pull up an ailing or recently deceased plant to see first hand what the roots look like. Root-knot-nematode-infected roots look bizarrely knotted and swollen and are obviously unable to support the plant. As tomato fruits mature and heat stimulates growth, the plants can’t keep up. There is no cure for badly infected plants, and fear of this organism is why gardeners often plant big African marigolds (Tagetes erecta) around food plants because it is known to discourages nematode populations.\nReplace Old Soil\nRotation is key, but soil replacement can also work wonders towards keeping raised bed problems at bay. Replacing your garden or potting soil with fresh every other year will help discourage the accumulation of diseases and pests, such as the root-knot nematode. Quality garden soil like Black Gold Garden Soil is rich, fertile, and fresh. It reduces the need to rotate crops, will fortify your garden to increase yields, and rid your raised bed of “dirty laundry” that could mean the downfall of your summer garden plantings.\nThe more cautious your are about ensuring healthy soil for your raised garden, the better. For example, if you move into a new home with an existing raised garden, it’s best to assume its potting soil is nutritionally exhausted and that crop rotation has not occurred. Plus, it’s just a good idea to replace the soil anyway because the removal process may give you clues to other problems, like drainage or the presence of aggressive underground grass roots. Excavation will help you discover if there are problems lurking below.\nSmall gardens don’t have to be hotbeds of pests and diseases, if you know how to compensate with rotation and garden soil replenishment. Rotate your crops liberally (preferably on a 4-year cycle), replace old, spent soil, and reap the harvest!\nThis site may contain content (including images and articles) as well as advice, opinions and statements presented by third parties.

I noticed that it had an impact on the health of the vegetables. This got me thinking; do marigolds really improve the way a tomato plant grows?\nSo what effect do marigolds have on tomato plants? As it turns out, they serve as great companions for a lot of plants including tomatoes. Marigolds and tomatoes share similar conditions for growth.\nMore importantly, marigolds protect tomato roots from harmful nematodes present in the soil. They also deter beetles from harming the fruit.\nVegetables and fruits are usually the hardest to grow in a garden. There are a number of things that you have to constantly ward against and even then it is difficult to know for sure if they will grow to resemble the produce we buy in the supermarket.\nThose who’ve tried will know. People are constantly on the lookout for tips and tricks to help them maintain a healthy and beautiful garden.\nThis article provides some interesting observations to help you do just that with your fruits and vegetables specifically tomatoes.\nHow marigolds help tomato plants grow better?\nMarigolds are one of the most beautiful varieties of flowers available. Ranging from bright yellow to orange and some shades of red, they are found growing in a number of green pastures from the beginning of summer until the start of autumn.\nWhile most of us are mesmerized by the beauty, only those with an avid interest in gardening know that the benefits of marigold go beyond just uplifting the colors in the field.\nMarigolds have been considered an amazing companion plant for many years now. Farmers around the world use them to protect their fruit and vegetable plants in particular from different pests and destructive micro-organisms.\nScientists have carried out numerous researches and it has been found that marigolds are effective at keeping root-knot nematodes at bay.\nRoot-knot nematodes are microscopic parasites which live in the soil and infect the parts of a plant buried in the ground. They commonly attach themselves to the roots of potato plants and cause inflammations which can be almost an inch wide.\nThis causes stunted growth, discoloration and gradual death of the plant. Marigolds are effective at preventing these micro-organisms from reaching the roots of the tomato plant.\nMarigolds act as trap crops for these nematodes. Their roots produce substances which can effectively limit the growth and infestation of these pests.\nPlanting marigolds as a cover for your tomato crops means that the worms will be attracted towards the roots of the former. The plant can then kill them using the chemicals which are produced by its roots.\nWhile this does not guarantee a completely pest-free environment, it goes a long way in limiting their spread to a great extent. Farmers and gardeners also believe that the pungent smell from these plants acts as a deterrent for bigger insects like bugs, whiteflies and even bigger creatures like birds or rabbits.\nRead also: Tips on Growing Tomatoes\nWhy do marigolds serve as good companion plants?\nThere is no doubt to the fact that marigolds work amazingly with tomatoes but there is evidence to suggest that they can provide the same level of protection to other crops too. If you are a keen gardener who grows fruits and vegetable regularly, there are chances that you will have witnessed this. If not, be sure to give it a careful try.\nThe French marigold is considered the best variety to accompany a number of plants like potatoes, kale, broccoli, eggplant and squash among numerous others. Mexican marigolds are also great companion plants but the French variation is the weapon of choice.\nGardeners believe that the strong smell of the marigold’s masks that of the vegetables that you are growing, therefore, keeping harmful animals at a safe distance.\nThere is no denying the fact that marigolds are beautiful. The vibrant and attractive colors they add to the garden is refreshing to the eyes especially during the spring. They are also very low on maintenance which means that they will last a long time without causing any severe problems.\nThey are one of the few plants which produce nematode killing substances in their roots. This coupled with the strong smells which are repulsive to animals means that they have a sound defense mechanism for themselves.\nAnother benefit of planting marigold as a companion plant is that they offer a helping hand in pollination too. How do they do that, you may ask? Well, the answer is that they attract bees which gardeners know are one of the most effective agents for spreading seeds from flowers and other plants over large areas.\nMarigolds have been in use as a companion plant for many years now. They have been practically proven to deliver results not only in uplifting the overall feel of the garden but well beyond that. The protection that they provide against a diverse range of threats is incredible. From beetles to rodents, there are little known harmful agents which can beat them.\nMarigold Tomato Variety\nMarigolds, belonging to the genus Tagetes, is a flower that comes in several different varieties. They are classified based on the regions they are native to, the colors in which they grow and other factors as well. The most common color that we have come across is obviously the yellow and orange varieties but it is hard to believe that there are red, pink and even white marigolds growing around the world.\nHowever, it is quite important to point out that not all of these varieties are suitable as companion plants, especially not for tomatoes. Not all the kinds of marigolds perform the same functions as those which come recommended to be planted alongside tomatoes or other vegetables. For instance, only one or two types of these flowers produce the necessary chemicals to kill and repel nematodes.\nFrench marigolds are one of the select few types which are known to produce these substances. While the Mexican variety of these flowers comes in as a close second choice, most gardeners prefer to go with the French. If you are new to the world of gardening and are considering planting marigolds next to your tomato plants, it is best that you start with the French too.\nThe French variety of this flower is part of the shorter family of marigolds. Not only are the spectacular when growing in a bunch, but they also bring along the enormous benefits in protection that have been highlighted throughout our earlier discussion.\nOne of the main reasons why gardeners believe they have found a truly amazing companion plant in French marigolds is because of the ease with which they grow.\nAll that has to be done in order to grow marigolds is to plant the seed and make sure it gets the adequate water as well as sunlight. Once they grow to their normal height, which is between 8 and 42 inches, these flowers become extremely sturdy and can survive harsh circumstances. Marigolds are believed to be able to withstand close to droughts like conditions and still blossom.\nWhat should not be planted with tomatoes?\nThis is one of the most interesting questions to answer. That’s partly because gardeners and farmers differ on the exact plants which don’t go well with tomatoes but more importantly because most vegetables which are good companions for marigold are bad neighbors to tomatoes. Cabbages and all their relatives like broccoli, kale, and cauliflower are a big no, no for tomatoes.\nOther plants which stunt the growth of tomatoes or cause other damages to include corn, eggplants, potatoes, and peppers. Corns are dangerous companions for tomatoes because the worm which infects them is the same as the tomato fruitworm, which has also been called the cotton bollworm. This means that if the plants are growing together, it means a feast has been laid out for these insects.\nMature dill plants also begin to hamper tomato growth. Brinjals, more commonly known as eggplant, potatoes, and peppers are nightshade crops. Although the origins of the name are unclear it is believed that since some of these plants grow in places with low sunlight and some flower at night, the name seems appropriate.\nThe fact of the matter is that they are vulnerable to blight if they are planted in the soil again and again for several years. Planting tomatoes near these plants can cause the disease to transfer and destroy the crop.\nWalnuts, specifically black walnuts are the ones which produce chemicals that are harmful to tomato growth. These also give rise to walnut wilt. Now you may be wondering what these crops are not compatible with each other but they are good companions for marigolds.\nSo, what if these plants are placed in sync? You plant tomatoes, marigolds and then potatoes or cabbages or any other vegetable that you like. Well, there are a few problems with this.\nFirstly, plant roots spread far and wide, it is difficult to control their growth because they will extend to the areas where they think the best concentration of nutrients available.\nThis means that if potatoes are planted close to a tomato plant, the roots can spread and still pose as a fungus threat to the tomato plant.\nSecondly, marigolds are not powerful enough to protect several plants from harmful impacts at the same time. Lastly, this type of plantation can destroy the soil by making it a breeding ground for pests and harmful for any type of fruit, vegetable or even flower in the future.\nDo marigolds repel tomato worms?\nYes, they do and are quite good at it too. We have seen in great detail how marigolds are amazing protection against nematodes but they offer the same type of cover against common worms which threaten tomato plants like thrips and hornworms. Marigolds use the secretion from their roots to protect the soil and the scent from the flowers to cover the air.\nHornworms and moths are considered one of the biggest threats to a tomato plant. They are given the name because they love to feed on the nectar of the fruit of the tomato plant. These pests in a small quantity can run havoc on your crops if they are not dealt with effectively.\nAlthough pesticides can also work at limiting their reach to the plants you are growing but we all know that these chemicals can have other detrimental consequences too.\nMarigolds and their strong repulsive odor are quite significant at keeping tomato worms away from not only the flowers but the vegetable crop too. This is also great for protection against other predators which might try and damage the plant.\nAgain, this scent is more commonly found in the two varieties of marigolds which come in recommended as companion plants to tomatoes i.e. French and Mexican.\nSome people also recommend keeping wasps in order to keep these harmful moths at bay but this can become a problem for someone maintaining a home garden. Moreover, when you have plants like marigolds to do the job for you, there is little else that might be required.\nOf course, there will be some care still required on your end but it will not be as extensive as it would be without the marigolds.\nHow to grow marigolds with tomato plants\nThere are a few things which you have to bear in mind while planting marigolds between or close to potato plants. The first is distance. It is recommended to plant the flowers at least 18 or 2 inches away from the tomato. This allows both the plants to have enough space to benefit from one another and not harm them in any way.\nYou can plant both of these simultaneously but make sure that initially, you water the seeds inside the soil. Marigolds are quick to spread so you can plant lots of them at closely calculated intervals.\nWhile they won’t call for that frequent maintenance but you will have to trim the bushes regularly. Otherwise, the marigold bush will grow out of control and overcrowd the tomato, restricting its growth.\nOne important aspect to bear in mind when growing marigolds is watering. These flavors, while they are popping out from the seeds, do not cope well with soggy soils.\nIf you water the ground too often, the flowers may not grow at all. Make sure that you keep an interval between watering which allows the ground to dry to a certain level. The beginning of the day is the best time to water the plants.\nMany people argue that marigolds and tomatoes being amazing companions is just a myth. Practical evidence proves otherwise. For many years, gardeners and farmers have used these flowers to protect their crops and there are studies which establish the scientific credibility of the phenomenon too.\nSo, if you are a person who is growing tomatoes in your garden, you can try planting marigolds to help you relieve some of the tension which might arise from caring for these plants. Just make sure that you don’t overdo it.']	['<urn:uuid:b925dc38-5249-4bb4-a90c-81172a8de1fe>', '<urn:uuid:1766ab91-85b2-4b2b-b6ff-1e0ff787d04e>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	10	101	3067
80	How did the East India Company's flag specifications change when the Bombay Marine was granted the privilege of wearing the Union Jack by the Duke of Clarence in 1827?	On June 12, 1827, the Bombay Marine was granted the privilege of wearing the Union Jack and a long Pendant with St George's Cross on a white field near the mast with a red fly, in addition to the Red Ensign which all ships belonging to His Majesty's subjects were legally required to wear.	"['Last modified: 2017-12-17 by rob raeside\nKeywords: east india company |\nLinks: FOTW homepage | search | disclaimer and copyright | write us | mirrors\nUntil about 1630 when the red, blue and white ensigns were introduced, nearly all English ships are thought to have flown striped ensigns with a St George\'s cross canton. It is unlikely that the East India Company used striped ensigns before 1660, and possibly not until 1673. The ensigns usually had nine, eleven or thirteen red and white stripes, with a small canton of St George\'s cross until c1707, a 1606 Union canton from c1707 until 1801, and an 1801 Union from then until 1830, when they were replaced by Red Ensigns. After 1801 some ensigns had a central vertical red stripe.\nby Phil Nelson\nJacks had nine stripes with no canton and continued to be used until 1863 by the Bombay Marine and 1877 by the Bengal Marine. As a signal flag it was still in use in 1895, when P. Downes referred to an \'Old Indian Navy Jack which will appear in every hoist except single flag signals and the numerical signal\' in his Code of Signals for Use in Connection with Lighthouses and Light-Vessels on the Burma Coast.\nSources: C.R. Low, History of the Indian Navy and A. Rowand, Naval and Maritime Flags of British India.\nDavid Prothero, 30 August 1999\nImage by Phil Nelson\nWhen the proclamation of 1674 authorized the red ensign for English merchant ships, the Honourable East India Company was restricted in 1676 to using their ensigns in eastern waters, and beyond St Helena in the Atlantic Ocean. Wilson in Flags at Sea (1999) shows several ensigns of the Honourable East India Company with proportions that are roughly 3:5 and varying numbers of stripes. The first of these is the East India Company ensign until 1707. This is a thirteen-stripe version with the St George\'s Cross in the canton.\nThe top image is similar to the illustration in B. Lens\'s chart A Good View of the Flags which most Nations bear at Sea of 1700, but the one in Lens has eleven stripes, as shown below.\nImage by Phil Nelson\nWilson also shows an image from an English signal book, dated 1711, that has nine stripes with a St George\'s Cross in the Canton. The colours of the stripes are reversed from the image by António Martins shown above.\nImage by Phil Nelson\nFrom 1707 to approximately 1800, Wilson shows the Honourable East India Company ensign with the British Union flag.\nImage by Phil Nelson\nThis in turn was replaced around 1801 with the newer Union flag.\nimage by Kim Rowden, 6 November 2016\nWilson shows an image from a black and white flag plate in Rees\'s Cyclopedia (1820). It is similar to the thirteen-stripe version shown above, except that the colours of the stripes are reversed. The proportions of the drawing are approximate.\nimage by Kim Rowden, 6 November 2016\nAnother variant is shown in the Laurie chart in Wilson. This is an Honourable East India Company nine-stripe ensign with a Union Flag in the canton.\nimage by Kim Rowden, 6 November 2016\nI was concerned that the countercharge, etc., didn\'t meet the red stripe and about the overlap, but in looking at Laurie\'s chart, this feature seems to be replicated there as well.\nPhil Nelson, 24 and 25 January 2000\nI think that you can\'t go wrong with East India Company flags, as long as there are horizontal red and white stripes. They seem to have made them up as they went along. Nine, ten, eleven or thirteen stripes; cantons of varying size, some sitting on stripes and some cutting through stripes. One variation is shown in a painting of the East India Company\'s Yard at Deptford, c.1660 with ensigns that have, one red stripe at the top of the fly, one lined up with the arm of the St George\'s Cross, and four red and three white stripes below the canton.\nAfter 1801 some jacks and ensigns had a vertical red stripe, slightly wider than the horizontal stripes, in the centre of the flag. On others the central horizontal red stripe of seven was widened to match the vertical stripe. In one example the Union Jack canton occupies the whole of the first quarter of the ensign, cutting into the surrounding\nThere\'s a lot of information in Naval and Maritime Flags of British India from 1600 by Captain A. Rowand, Royal Indian Marine. The original 1909 typescript, which used to be in the Records Department of the India Office, is probably now in the British Library. There is a type-written, hand-painted, 1935 copy, in the Library of the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.\nDavid Prothero, 27 January 2000\n""When the proclamation of 1674 authorized the red ensign for English merchant ships, the Honourable East India Company was restricted in 1676 to using their ensigns in eastern waters, and beyond St Helena in the Atlantic Ocean.""\nThis is somewhat misleading, as it implies that the East India Company had the right to sail under their own flag, and that this right was being restricted. They had no such right, and being allowed to wear their own flag in certain areas was a concession, arranged, as far as I know, without the warrant, that was required by the Royal Proclamation of 18 September 1674:\n""And His Majesty doth hereby further Command all His Loving Subjects, that without such Warrant as aforesaid, they presume not to wear on board their Ships or Vessels any Jacks made in imitation of His Majesties; or any other Flags, Jacks or Ensigns whatsoever, than those usually heretofore worn on Merchant Ships, viz: The Flag and Jack White, with a Red Cross (commonly called St George\'s Cross) passing quite through the same; and the Ensign Red, with the like Cross in a Canton White, at the upper corner thereof next to the Staff.""That the Company were not fully complying with this proclamation was apparently ignored until 1676, when, as Wilson puts it in \'Flags at Sea\', ""...the ever-busy Pepys took issue with the continued use on the Company\'s ships of the striped ensign ..."" Samuel Pepys, Secretary of the Admiralty, was a personal friend of Sir John Banks, a Kent businessman, who was Governor of the East India Company, and it appears that the concession to allow, in certain areas, use of the Company Flag instead of the English flags, may have been an arrangement between Pepys and Banks.\nPepys was apparently under some pressure from officers of the Royal Navy over this issue, and he wrote to Sir John in December of 1676 which I quote from Perrin P.313: ""...but forasmuch as it cannot be thought fit for me to remain under constant accountably for any behaviour of his Majesty\'s officers different from his pleasure signified by a proclamation, I desire that you will take an opportunity of mentioning this thing to my honoured friends of the Company, to the end that (in case their service be indeed concerned in the continuance of this their usage) they may\ntake some way of making their desires known to his Majesty...etc., etc.""\nLike David, as far as I am aware no such application was made nor required Warrant issued, but the fact remains that ships of the Honourable East India Company continued to fly the striped ensign despite its being illegal for them to do so.\nChristopher Southworth, 18 August 2004\nImage by Blas Delgado Ortiz\n""The Company\'s Jack was used as a Jack by the Company\'s regular traders, and by vessels of the Bombay Marine sometime prior to 1828, although the latter service appears to have frequently worn the Union Jack prior to 1828, it\nwas never used as a Jack by the Indian Navy, but was flown at the peak to denote a court martial sitting, and was also used in conjunction with, but superior to, signal flags showing the name of the vessel in the list of the Indian Navy. It was of course used on dressing ship etc, and also as a Jack by the pattimars-of-war commanded by natives.""\nSource: Naval and Maritime Flags of British India, written in about 1909, by Captain A. Rowand, Royal Indian Marine.\nDavid Prothero, 26 June 2002\nimage by Pete Loeser and Željko Heimer[Editorial Comment: Gridiron (no relationship to American Football) is a term, now obsolete, for the red and white striped flag of the Honourable East India Company. Although this particular version of Gridiron ensign seems to have existed, some of its design details remain unclear. There are also no indications that it was ever used as a war flag (as reported elsewhere); but it was possibly used as a jack by armed vessels of the HEIC in India between c1824-1864.]\nThe latest issue of Flagmaster has a short article about the flags of the British East India Company. One of the illustrations shows the EIC flag with the post-1800 union and the St. George\'s cross on top of the stripes. The text says that the St. George\'s cross version was adopted about 1801 when the Company established its force of armed cruisers, and was discontinued in 1824. Perrin (p. 131, fn 3) says that this flag was\nintroduced ""about 1820,"" and that it was not used as an ensign after 1824, although it was still used as a jack or signal flag. He does not indicate that it was used only by the armed vessels.\nThe EIC\'s ""Marine"" (maritime armed force) was actually established in the early 17th century, and was known variously as the ""Company Marine,"" and the ""Bombay Marine."" In 1830, it was renamed the ""Navy of India"" and partially integrated into the Royal Navy. Sutton\'s ""Lords of the East"" states that at this time the Navy of India was granted the privilege of flying ""the union jack."" A painting of the East Indiaman ""Waterloo,"" that appears on the cover of Sutton\'s book shows the vessel flying an EIC ensign with the St. George\'s cross. The ""Waterloo"" was not part of the Marine, and was in service between 1816 and 1832. (BTW, her ensign is shown with 21 stripes, including the horizontal bar of the cross). A color plate in the same book shows an unnamed East Indiaman at anchor in St. Helena, flying the same flag. The ships of the EIC Marine did not generally operate in the South Atlantic; they were based in Surat or Bombay and operated on the Indian west coast and adjacent seas.\nThe bottom line is that there seems to be some puzzlement about whether the St. Georges cross version of the EIC flag was used only by the Marine, or whether it was also flown by Company merchant ships. Also, did the discontinuance of the Company ensign in 1824 apply to the Marine, soon to become the Navy of India?\nPeter Ansoff, 24 June 2007\nInformation about this is conflicting, and it seems that it was probably used by the Bombay Marine, and by other Company vessels, both before and after 1801. The unnamed East Indiaman at anchor in St. Helena in the colour plate in Sutton\'s book that you refer to is flying an ensign with the overall St George\'s cross and a pre-1801 canton.\nConcerning the discontinuance of the Company ensign in 1824, it did apply to the Bombay Marine but was apparently ignored by the Bengal Marine. When the Bombay Marine were granted the privilege of wearing the Union Jack it was stated to be in addition to the Red Ensign. On 12 June 1827 the Duke of Clarence, Lord High Admiral, issued a Warrant granting, ""the privilege of wearing, in addition to the Red Ensign, which all ships belonging to His Majesty\'s subjects should legally wear, the Union Jack and a long Pendant having St George\'s Cross on a white field in the upper part next the mast with a red fly. I do therefore, by virtue of the power invested in me hereby warrant and authorise the Union Jack and Pendant above described being worn on board all ships of the Bombay Marine accordingly."" However, according to R.F.Barlow, a Hooghly River Pilot writing in 1896, the Bengal Marine flew the Company Jack, and a striped Ensign that had an overall St George\'s cross with three red and three white stripes in quarters two, three and four until 1861.\nDavid Prothero, 26 June 2007\nAn illustration in Perrin (Sheet X, No. 11) exactly mirrors this drawing, however, during some recent research (on rank flags of the RN) Martin Grieve and I have found that the illustrations in Perrin were sometimes incorrect (or incorrectly labelled), and whilst this flag is listed as being that of the East India Company in 1822, there is nothing in the text to explain it and I am not inclined to trust it without reservation.\nChristopher Southworth, 16 May 2013\nA drawing of this ensign is in ""Naval and Maritime Flags of British India from 1600"", a 1909 typescript by Captain A.Rowand, D.S.O., Royal Indian Marine. There are also two other drawings of the same flag. He presumes that only one is correct, but does not know which it is.\nWhampoa in China c1835\nAlthough the Committee of Shipping suggested in 1824 that, ""the Company’s Colours can used as a jack or signal flag"", is there any evidence that the ensign was ever used as a jack? A print of the a painting of the ""Waterloo"" at Whampoa was published in 1835, but the ""Waterloo"" ceased to be employed in the China trade in 1832. Theoretically the picture should have been painted before 1824.\nDavid Prothero, 17 May 2013\nA touch of caution here, it is entirely possible that the picture was painted before 1824 as David says (when the ensign was still in use as such), or that the ensign itself was not used as a jack in the years before the Indian Mutiny?\nChristopher Southworth, 17 May 201\nThe number of stripes on the EIC flag seems to have varied, but 13 was the most common. Apparently the number had no symbolic significance. Does anyone have any thoughts on why it was 13? Could it have had something to do with the\nstandard dimensions of British ensigns, and the width of the bunting that the stripes were made from?\nPeter Ansoff, 16 August 2007\nIt is known that in 1687 naval flags were made from fabric 22 inches wide and that the standard proportion of \'colours\' was 11:18. I don\'t think that leads anywhere. Perhaps more significant is that in some illustrations of pre-1707 EIC ensigns the stripes are the same width as the arms of the cross of St George in the canton. The arms of the cross are about 1/6th or 1/7th the width of the canton. There are thus either six or seven stripes in the upper fly. If the width of the canton is about half the width of the ensign, and the top and bottom stripes are to be of the same colour, there must then be either seven or six stripes in the lower hoist/fly, giving thirteen stripes in total.\nDavid Prothero, 19 August 2007\nImage by Martin Grieve\nThis East India Company 19th century masthead flag is from a black and white reproduction of a painting in the Science Museum of the East Indiaman ""Earl Balcarras"", which did nine voyages to China between 1815 and 1831. The colours are deduced from the corresponding shades of grey in the Red Ensign. My guess is that it is the flag of the Commodore of the Company\'s commercial fleet ?\nDavid Prothero, 24 May 2005\nI have two books, The Honourable Company: the East India Company by Brian Gardner (Dorset Press, 1971), and The Honourable Company: a History of the English East India Company by John Keay (Macmillan, 1991). Both feature the arms of the East India Company, which I\'ll attempt to describe. A white shield with a red St George\'s cross with a small shield with something I can\'t make out in the upper left quadrant. A rampant lion on either side as supporters, holding a flag pole with the Union Jack flying behind. Above the shield, a rampant lion holding a crown. The motto is Auspicio Regis et Senatus Angliae (by command of the king and parliament of England).\nDipesh Navsaria, 18 November 1995\nThe undescribed device in the canton is actually the royal arms of England, as introduced by Henry IV and used until the accession of James I. More about the arms of the company here:\nThe banner of arms seems to have been used as well.

81	curious about modern art history what makes mark rothko paintings special compared to regular art	Mark Rothko's paintings are notable for their large, figureless fields of paint that express mystical ambitions. While they might appear to compete with religious transcendence, they actually function as ambivalent icons. Though the exact nature of their iconic content is undetermined, they still participate in some way in the reality of religious icons. This makes them unique in how they bridge spiritual and artistic expression.	['In a recent book assessing the state of evangelical scholarship, Mark Noll refers to a boomlet in evangelical art history [that] rests squarely on the work of the Dutch Reformed scholar Hans Rookmaaker. Had Noll seen Daniel Siedells book God in the Gallery , he might have thought differently. Siedell is a long way from Rookmaaker, and his book¯whether or not it can be called evangelical¯is no boomlet. God in the Gallery is an impressive detonation in and of itself.\nThe Christianity-and-art conversation is gridlocked. The stalled traffic includes those who are profoundly suspicious of the art world, and those who are infuriated enough by this unforgivably conservative suspicion that they, in turn, write contemporary artists a theological blank check. A book capable of broaching this impasse has long needed to be written¯but who would have suspected it would be this good? What makes God in the Gallery noteworthy is that it addresses another gridlock as well, that of contemporary art. The traffic in this case involves those liberated by the end of modernity to explore spiritual directions, and those committed to keeping art a staunchly secular enterprise. The art world, insists Siedell, is growing increasingly uncomfortable with its collective unbelief.\nSiedells qualifications enable him to address both these dilemmas. He is a firmly ecclesial Lutheran with deep¯one might say overriding¯sympathies for the Orthodox Church. In addition, Siedell holds a Ph.D. in contemporary art (he studied with noted critic Donald Kuspit), and he is a seasoned curator with a decade of gallery experience.\nSimply put, God in the Gallery succeeds by dividing, that is, by clearly distinguishing the sanctuary from the salon . The author has no interest in churches aping galleries or galleries playing church. But what keeps Siedell from merely erecting a Jeffersonian wall of separation between church and gallery is his unflinching insistence that the churchs aesthetic framework, grounded in the ecumenical warrant for icons, is strong enough to inform, shape, and underwrite the practice of contemporary art. The churchs aesthetics and poetics . . . is the ground of all aesthetics and poetics. And the direction of influence goes from the church outward toward culture, not from culture to a passive, inert, irrelevant church.\nTo buttress his argument, Siedell quotes Christoph Cardinal Schönborn: A Church that in her liturgy, in her very life, draws vitality from the sense of awe in facing the mystery, will provide breathing space for any art whose primary purpose is not a breathless pursuit of outward success. In order for this vision to be realized, however, Protestant approaches are simply not expansive enough for Siedell. Only the economy of the icon can provide an important foundation on which to rethink modern and contemporary art. Byzantine insights from the eighth century are marshaled to fortify the twenty-first.\nAll these are serious claims, and Siedell has done the work necessary to back them up. The book offers a brief survey of modern art, an introduction to the condition of and key players in contemporary art, a summary of the academic¯populist divide in art criticism, a diagnosis of the Christianity-and-art conversation, and a primer on recent theological trends. Of course one book cant do all these completely, but this one does them all surprisingly well.\nMost interesting in my view is Siedells ambitious attempt to solve a major crisis in the discipline of art history¯the status of the term art . For Siedell, the development of art as a Western concept is something we should accept. Not all products of modernity are theologically and spiritually suspect. But, while Siedell accepts arts institutional reality, he does not accept the narrow range of activities the term art currently represents.\nInstead, Siedell borrows from the philosopher Paul Crowther and suggests defining art as common (universal) human practice of making and experiencing whose primary goal, Siedell adds, is to seek communion with God. The most effective example of this has been the Byzantine icon. Nicene Christianity does not merely tolerate images in the church. It requires them. While it certainly needs to be developed further, Siedell has suggested a Copernican revolution in the artistic solar system that makes the Christian icon the governing sun. Christianity, therefore, in all its myriad cultural and material manifestations is never absent from the modern artist.\nSiedell even manages to pull recent, stranger trends of contemporary art into this iconic orbit. In the shift from modern to postmodern art, Siedell sees a transcendence in transition from modernitys disembodied purity to one that is sought in and through embodiment, tradition, cultural practice, and the material world. This resonates with, without being equivalent to, the Christian sacramental tradition. High is the pile of sophisticated recent books on theological aesthetics. God in the Gallery might enable such labor to actually reach where it is needed most¯plunging from the ethereal heights of the seminaries deep into the streets (even the gutters) of contemporary art.\nThe modern artist Mark Rothko (1903“1970) provides an example of how Siedells vision plays out. Initially, the mystical ambition of Rothkos large, figureless fields of paint might be considered direct competition to Christian faith¯vying for the very transcendence that religion has already achieved. Siedell neither gives in to this suspicion, nor does he offer unqualified endorsement. Instead, he secures a complex middle ground: Mark Rothkos brooding paintings function ambivalently as icons; or rather, the content of their iconicity is underdetermined. But this does not mean that they do not participate in some way in the reality of the icon.\nNot all of Siedells interpretations, however, are as successful as his take on Rothko. Siedell is uncritical of Janine Antonis Gnaw , where the sculptor chews on massive cubes of chocolate and lard. This is similar, Antonini says, to receiving the host from the priest in the old-fashioned way. In defense of the sculptor, Siedell claims that the complex relationship between tasting and seeing can be expressed outside the divine liturgy only through the aesthetic complexities of art. (What about restaurants?) Siedell is celebratory of German artist Wolfgang Laib, who considers the attempt to create beauty a futile pursuit. He sees Robert Gobers headless Christ installation as an attempt for an alienated Catholic to create an alternative sacred space. Another artist writes directly on his work that his piece is in fact a meaningless failure. While Siedell suggest we look deeper, some might wish to take the artist at his word. At some points Siedells interpretations were convincing, at others, readers might share my sentiment: I believe, help my unbelief. Nevertheless, Siedell does not claim to offer the Christian explanation of these works of art, and he does not suggest¯as have some¯that they infiltrate the liturgy. Siedell errs on the side of charity because he aims to prompt the skeptic to take another look, and to critique the way Siedell carries out his vision is not to dismiss the vision itself.\nStill, at times Siedell is burdened by unhelpful terminology pulled straight from the paradigms he has done so much to overcome. He refers to the neoconservative captivity of art criticism, and is sharply critical of New Criterion editor Hilton Kramers conservative political agenda. Indeed, politics can affect art and art criticism for the worse. But Siedell breathes not a word of criticism for the leftist agenda that¯it takes willful effort not to see¯has overtaken so much contemporary art and art criticism. Because it is this agenda that Kramer is attempting to counter, one would have at least hoped for a pox on both your houses from Siedell. (His reference, albeit in a footnote, to Christian anarchism without critical distance is unsettling). Like it or not, a healthy art world may depend on a stable free world. There is a reason that Enrique Martínez Celaya, the Cuban-born artist whom Siedell lionizes, is flourishing here and not in, say, Cuba.\nIt is tempting to suggest that Siedell expends so much charity to the art world that he has little left for his Christian colleagues. Though he is never belittling or rude, Siedell hits his co-religionists hard. Gregory Wolfe, editor of the religion and art journal Image , is criticized for not differentiating clearly enough between the institutional framework of the church and the world of art. Cutting edge innovation does not belong in the liturgy, where recognition by the faithful is essential. On the other hand, Siedell is frustrated with those who have tried to establish an alternative, Christian art world through a network of Christian college art departments and organizations. Siedell berates what we might call this Hauerwasian model of Christian art enclaves. He prefers instead what could fairly be called a more Neuhausian engagement of Christians in arts public square.\nThe model for Siedells art criticism is no one less than the apostle Paul at Athens (Acts 17). Art can function as an altar to an unknown God, and the Christian art critic can say, with Paul, that which you worship as unknown, I proclaim to you (Acts 17:23). There is indeed a remarkable parallel between first-century Athenian pagans and the twenty-first-century art world, and Siedell could have perhaps taken it further. Both Athenians and art enthusiasts, for example, spend their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new (Acts 17:21). But there is also, of course, a great divide between then and now. The Athenians knew nothing of Christianity. Contemporary artists do, and remind us of that fact by intentionally mixing Christian imagery, often with deliberate offense, into their work. The point is important because Paul makes much of it. While God has overlooked the times of human ignorance, now he commands all people everywhere to repent (Acts 17:30). Siedell might avoid this criticism by suggesting that the contemporary artists alienation from traditional Christianity by either injury or ignorance functions as a second naiveté.\nBut Pauls vision goes further. The altar to an unknown God was not the only altar in Athens. In fact, we read that this was only one in a city packed with idols which greatly distressed the apostle (Acts 17:16). Engagement with contemporary art sometimes leads to this conclusion, which is equally Pauline. Noting that art has failed as a rival religion does not necessarily indicate neoconservative captivity (and if it does, then count Nietzsche a neocon). Is it necessarily philistine to point out the unfortunate condition of contemporary art? Take for example, the abortion art catastrophe at Yale, or Banks Violettes recent show at the Whitney that meditates on Satanic ritual murders, or Damian Hirsts sadistic stations of the cross. Sadly, there is only more evidence today to support the reformed art historian Hans Rookmaakers 1970 thesis, Modern Art and the Death of a Culture. (A thesis, it is important to note, that Rookmaker complemented with daringly positive reviews of countless avant-garde exhibitions as well.)\nStill, as Siedell explains, the art world is extremely complex, and wholesale dismissals are entirely unwarranted. Many of the artists Siedell has worked with are also frustrated with the art world, and Siedells iconic vision is a needed strategy for that worlds renewal. Christians who consider contemporary art an unpleasant mystery will find this book an effective primer to genuine engagement. God in the Gallery infuses the Protestant art historical tradition with the broader insights of the Seventh Ecumenical Council, and it appropriately segregates liturgical and contemporary art, with the former underwriting the latter. The church is not a religious sphere separated from the realities of the world but reveals the worlds true meaning and significance. Siedells vision of contemporary art inspired by the Christian icon is a compelling one. At least for now, it is a reality in Orthodox cultures much more than in our own.\nMatthew J.

Macrophages specifically develop from monocytes and specialize in different areas of the body, acting as 'sweepers' that dispose of worn-out cells. In contrast, primary immunodeficiency diseases (PI) represent over 150 inherited conditions where the immune system lacks one or more types of immune tissues, proteins, or cells. This leads to increased susceptibility to infections, longer recovery times even with antibiotics, and recurring infections since the normal immune functions are impaired.

It can often be seen early in a child\'s life. However, signs of immune deficiency may also occur in older children, teenagers, or adults.\nTypes of PI\nPrimary immunodeficiency (PI) diseases differ in many ways. Some types of PI are characterized by low levels of antibodies. Others involve defects in T cells, B cells, granulocytes or the complement system.

One of the most common therapies is intravenous immunoglobulin, or IVIG.\nIntravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy is helpful to some people with primary immunodeficiency (PI) because it temporarily replaces infection-fighting antibodies that some PI patients are missing.\nThis purified plasma treatment contains antibodies collected from the plasma of healthy donors and purified through a special process so that the therapy is safe and effective. Most of the antibodies are of the IgG class of antibodies, also called immunoglobulin G or gamma globulin.\nIVIG is given intravenously, which means through a needle directly into a vein. Your doctor will determine the correct dosage, based on a number of individual factors, including your weight, your condition, and how well the IVIG treats or prevents symptoms.\nIVIG can be administered in a hospital outpatient unit, infusion center, or your home. A typical infusion takes 2-4 hours, although some patients may require slower infusions to avoid side effects.\nIVIG replaces antibodies the body should be making, but does not help the patient\'s own immune system make more, so repeat doses are needed, usually every 3 to 4 weeks.\nSince primary immunodeficiency patients aren\'t ""cured"" by IVIG, they can still contract an infection, but infections have been shown to be less frequent and less severe.\nPI patients who rely on IVIG generally need infusions throughout their lives.\n1.

83	What factors affect cloud data control and service agreements?	Cloud data control is influenced by three key parties: the user, the cloud provider, and the region's jurisdiction. Service agreements are defined through terms of service that specify data usage rights, but these are restricted by regional governing principles like England's Copyright and Rights in Databases Regulations. Additionally, providers must establish clear Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that document required service levels, include measurement mechanisms, and specify financial penalties for non-compliance. The agreements must also address onward transfer of data, ensuring third-party suppliers maintain compliance with privacy standards.	['When trying to figure out who has rights to your data there are three things to consider: you, the cloud provider, and the region your data is held in. A lot of the issues become issues because of the varying laws; where your data is held might be in different country than the country you uploaded from. So, even after you figure out what your agreement is with a Cloud provider they can be subject to the particular laws of another country; fore instance America has a set of laws known as the Patriot Act which grants the US government access under certain conditions. So even after you figure out who owns the data, and what that means, you might not have control over who is accessing the data.\nWhen you decide on a Cloud provider there are a number of things that you want to look at. One of them being the terms of service that will, most likely, define how a provider views your data, and what they can do with it. The terms of service will be restricted by your regions governing principles. Fore-instance in England they have the ‘Copyright and Rights in Databases Regulations 1997’ to help clear up some of the vagaries of this new technological development. The law defines two types of data one that is protected by copyright law, and ones that aren’t but are still regulated in their way. The existence of the law is a step in the right direction towards clarifying ownership of the information that is being stored in the Cloud.\nAlthough to confuse this issue even further is the fact that some of your information may be stored in your own database but you are using a Cloud service to handle it from time to time. Or your Cloud provider is servicing out to another Cloud provider; so they may host your information in a storage unit that isn’t their own. Each of these situations has unique problems and each part of this chain of concerns depends on user agreements and the particular governing bodies. So there is no single solution to answer the question of who owns your data, and as this issue becomes generally understood hopefully we will see some best practices winning out. Although I wouldn’t necessarily say there is no way to find out. There are some things that can be done to better understand what is happening. Unfortunately one of those things is reading over all your relevant user agreements, and as one source claims it would take roughly 250 working hours to read all the user/privacy agreements most of us come across in one year. So you have to balance your need to know with your time, but be warned the details are important.\nUnderstanding governing rules of where your data is being held or processed is not insignificant either. Each region is going to have its own governing rules about what happens when data is processed and the processing of the data may influence who owns the data now that it has been changed. So each step and movement of your data becomes an important issue to consider when deciding on a Cloud provider.\nWho owns your data, then? It depends on the governing laws and user agreement made between you and the Cloud provider. It also depends upon the governing laws of where your data is being held, in addition to the agreements that your cloud provider may be making with their cloud provider. The Cloud has so much under the umbrella of Cloud services, that often one type of Cloud provider will outsource to another type of Cloud provider.', 'One of the main barriers to cloud adoption is data privacy. This is an issue because, for the majority of cloud providers, EU/EEA and US data privacy and Information Security standards are minefields which are very difficult to cross. And that is because their focus has been on the ease of use and functionality of their services rather than the all-important data privacy, information security, data integrity and reliability requirements around providing these services responsibly.\nBy submitting your personal information, you agree that TechTarget and its partners may contact you regarding relevant content, products and special offers.\nBut, when looking through the plethora of cloud service providers, you can immediately sort the ‘wheat from the chaff’ once you start drilling down into the data privacy, information security, data integrity and reliability capabilities offered to ensure the protection of your and your customers’ data.\nIn this guest blog post, Mike McAlpen, the executive director of security & compliance and data privacy officer at 8×8 Solutions outlines the questions cloud users must ask their providers before signing a contract.\nHave you chosen the right cloud services provider?\n– Mike McAlpen\nBy asking your cloud services provider the following questions you will be on the way to knowing whether you can entrust your data into its care.\n- Compliance with EU/EEA data privacy standards\nThe most important question is whether your provider can provide third-party verification/audit assurance of their compliance with EU/EEA and/or US data privacy standards? It is not enough for the provider to simply produce this verification/audit assurance, it must show that it has fully implemented the UK Top 20 Critical Security Controls For Cyber Defence and/or ISO 27001 and/or rigorous US standards such as the Federal Information Security Act (FISMA) and International Information PCI-DSS v3.0 security standards.\nIf this verification/audit assurance is not available then your business is at peril of not meeting EU/EEA and/or US standards.\nIn the US, many EU/EEA and other countries it can be a criminal offence if a breach of personal data privacy occurs and an individual employee or senior management, depending on the circumstances of the breach, is deemed to be responsible.\n- Onward Transfer of Data\nDoes your provider work with third-party suppliers in order to deliver the cloud services it offers? If so you must check that it has contracts in place with its third-party suppliers that provide assurance that they are, and will continue to be, compliant with EU/EEA and/or US standards.\n- Data Encryption\nDoes the cloud solutions vendor provide the capability to encrypt sensitive data when it is being transferred across the Internet and importantly again when it is ‘at rest’? (i.e. Stored by your cloud services provider, or in files on a computer, laptop USB flash drives or other electronic media?).\n- The Right to be Forgotten\nHas your provider’s solution been engineered to enable it to identify and associate each user’s personal information data? It must also provide the capability for each user to view and modify this personal data. In addition, if the user wishes this data to be deleted, the provider must then be able to completely erase all of that person’s personal data without affecting anyone else’s data.\n- Service Level Agreements (SLAs)\nOutside of compliance with data privacy standards, another key issue is asking your provider how you will determine and then document, within your services contract, the required service level agreements (SLAs). It’s no use whatsoever having the cloud services you have always wanted if you have no way of measuring or monitoring if they are actually being delivered to an acceptable level or if there are no financial penalties for non-compliance.\nIf your provider cannot answer “yes” to the above questions and you cannot agree to mutually acceptable SLAs – look for another provider!']	['<urn:uuid:1670378a-cd48-4531-9164-cdaa269023ee>', '<urn:uuid:23407dd1-0b20-4921-b3d0-b94fbfb1cb61>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	9	87	1243
84	need help with contract defense options if someone forced me to sign contract arizona	Duress is a valid defense against breach of contract accusations, which applies when a party was forced to enter into the contract against their will. Other possible defenses include fraud (where there was intentional misrepresentation), invalid contract, incapacity (like being a minor when signing), unclean hands (where both parties are at fault), mutual mistake, and illegality. It's recommended to speak with an experienced contract attorney to determine which defenses may apply to your specific situation.	"[""Breach of Contract and Non-Performance in Arizona\nA contract is a legally binding agreement between two parties, where one party offers to do something—for example, build a new house—and the other party accepts the offer and promises to do something in exchange—for example, pay money.\nIf one party fails to perform their obligations under an agreement without a reasonable excuse, the other party may be able to sue them for breach of contract.\nTo do this, the contract must be valid—it must be legal and both parties must have had the capacity to enter into it. A contract is also usually written, although a breach of contract can apply to an oral agreement in certain situations.\nWhere a party sues for breach of contract, the party that fails to perform their obligations is called the defendant and the wronged party is called the plaintiff.\nTypes of Breaches of Contract in Arizona\nNot all breaches are alike, and as such, not all breaches may be resolved through litigation. The law categorizes breaches of contracts based on their seriousness and timing.\nMaterial vs Minor Breach\nMaterial breaches occur when a defendant fails to perform an important obligation under the contract and that causes the contract to be “irreparably broken.” A material breach makes it impossible for the other party to perform their obligations under the contract.\nSome contracts explicitly define a material breach of the agreement. If the contract is silent on the issue, a court looks at factors like whether or not the defendant acted in bad faith and whether the plaintiff can be compensated for their loss. An example of a material breach is when a buyer fails to pay for a product they received.\nIn comparison, a minor breach does not materially disadvantage the other party and the contract can still be substantially performed. For example, the delivery of a product one day late does not go to the core of the agreement and is likely a minor breach.\nActual vs Anticipatory Breach\nAn actual breach occurs when one party fails to perform a term under the contract.\nAnticipatory breaches, on the other hand, occur when one party notifies the other that they will not comply with a term of the contract. This allows the other party to claim a breach of contract, even though it has not yet happened.\nRemedies in Arizona for Breaches of Contract\nRemedies exist to resolve contract breaches. What those remedies might be will depend on the facts and circumstances. More than one remedy may apply in your unique case. Potential remedies for a breach of contract include but are not necessarily limited to:\n- Compensatory damages, which are the most common type of remedy for breach of contract, covering the actual loss caused to the non-breaching party – these damages can be viewed in terms of (1) expectation damages where the non-breaching party recovers monetary damages based on the contract itself or the market value; and (2) consequential damages where the non-breaching party recovers indirect damages for reasonably foreseeable harm resulting from the breach\n- Punitive damages are the least common type of remedy for breach of contract but when awarded, are meant to punish the breaching party who acted fraudulently, maliciously, or willfully when breaching the contract and to prevent the same type of breaches in the future\n- Specific performance, which is the result of a court order requiring a defendant to perform an obligation under the contract\n- An injunction, which is a court order requiring a defendant not to do something, either temporarily or permanently\n- Rescission, which occurs when the court cancels the parties' obligations under the contract so that, theoretically at least, they are in the same position as before the contract was made\n- Restitution, which is a court order requiring the defendant to pay the plaintiff the amount agreed to in the contract – often involving the return of money or property\nAgain, the remedies available in your case depend on the jurisdiction, type of breach, specific terms of the contract, and circumstances in which the contract was made.\nPossible Defenses to Breaches of Contract\nIt is important to know the possible defenses a business or consumer may have when they breach a contract. If you are the party to breach the contract, make sure to speak with an attorney about how any one of these or other defenses may apply in your case.\nIf you are the non-breaching party, knowing these defenses can help you understand how the other party may argue their case. This knowledge will provide insight on how to move forward to uphold the terms and conditions of the contract or to come to another resolution, even if that means litigation.\nDefenses available to a party accused of breaching a contract include but are not limited to:\n- Fraud, where the plaintiff intentionally misrepresented material facts about the contract, making it fraudulent and therefore invalid\n- Invalid contract, where the contract does not meet the criteria of a valid contract\n- Duress, where the breaching party was forced to enter into the contract against their will\n- Incapacity, where the breaching party did not have the necessary capacity to enter into the contract in the first place – for example, because they were a minor at the time\n- Unclean hands, where both parties are at fault for the breach of contract\n- Mutual mistake, where the contract contains a mistake, different from what both parties intended\n- Illegality, where the contract was an agreement to do something illegal – for example, commit a murder\nRegardless of whether you are the breaching or non-breaching party, you should speak to an experienced contract attorney to see what remedies or defenses may apply to your unique situation.

86	water movement mixing methods compare	Fish ponds and wastewater lagoons employ different water movement methods for oxygenation. Fish ponds typically use pumps pushing water over waterfalls and bottom drains that draw water from the bottom, helping recirculate the total water column. Additional aeration can be achieved through air diffusers or air stones placed in various locations. Wastewater lagoons use more complex systems, including both coarse and fine bubble diffused aeration systems that create small bubbles to transfer oxygen, or mechanical aerators that create small water droplets propelled through the air. The mixing in lagoons is crucial for distributing pollutants throughout the entire volume and resuspending settled solids for proper treatment.	"['Pond aeration is one of the most important things you do for your pond! If you’ve ever asked the question of why exactly you have a pump pushing water over a waterfall, the answer is simply that it is keeping your fish alive. One can not have enough aeration. The Koi thrive better, bacteria in bio-filter are healthier! By increasing the ""Oxygen"" levels in the pond water, it will promote an overall healthier pond. One important area that higher levels of oxygen saturation help is in better promotion of good biological bacteria known as aerobic bacteria. Aerobic bacteria are the good bacteria in our pond that like oxygen. They grow and eat dead decaying plants, algae and pond muck up to 30 times faster than anaerobic bacteria (an-aerobic). Anaerobic bacteria live and grow in the absence of oxygen. Maintaining a constant supply of oxygen greatly improves the ability for the aerobic bacteria to thrive and keep your pond cleaner, the water clearer and fish healthier.\nIt is a common belief that having pond plants will aid in providing oxygen to the fish. This is true, however, during the night, the plants use oxygen too. If you have too many plants, you’re taking away the oxygen the fish are using. Although a pond aerator will help with this problem, it is good to manage how many plants you have feeding off the water.\nPonds that are designed with bottom drains permit better oxygen disbursement towards the bottom because water usually enters the pond\'s top surface and is drawn out from the bottom drain. This method recirculates the pond\'s total water column better than those that do not draw the water from the bottom. More oxygen content close to the bottom promotes the good bacteria which consumes waste that settles on the bottom, oxygen is a great oxidizer in itself!\nDecaying plants/debris/uneaten food in a very low oxygen level pond can create a toxic dissolved gas known as Hydrogen Sulfide. Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) is a gas that can form in aquatic gardens and ponds, when certain bacteria feed on organic debris in areas of the pond that are low or depleted in oxygen. The most common way to detect H2S is by a rotten egg odor that may bubble out of the water when bottom sediment is stirred-up while seining fish, planting, or conducting general maintenance. H2S may be more prevalent in ponds and aquatic gardens that have been established for several years and have been heavily stocked with aquatic plants and animals. This is because organic debris accumulates on the bottom sediment surface, preventing oxygen to diffuse into the pond bottom.\nAquatic gardens require that you drain and clean them on a yearly bases for the reason of removing dead decaying debris trapped in rocks, nooks and cranny\'s. As there is no bottom drain and as a rule only a skimmer unit with pump. This allows debris to settle to bottom and not be caught in a flowing water column to be removed from system. One way to improve this is to add a Air Diffuser to pond or air stones placed in various locations. You will need a outside air pump to perform these steps. This will cause a water column to start drawing bottom water to surface for gas exchange.\nThe above video show us a great example of how a aerated bottom drain works. You will notice how it lifts and then bursts to the surface for the exchange!', 'For years, wastewater lagoon systems have provided secondary treatment performance to many small to medium sized communities. The attributes of these processes have been attractive as cost effective options for the treatment of municipal wastewater. The aeration segment in these systems is the most critical component and is the core of their biological treatment process. A lagoon systems ability to aerate the incoming sewage has a direct impact on the level of wastewater treatment it achieves. This page will focus on the heart and soul of these systems - aeration.\nAn ample oxygen supply in a wastewater pond system is the key to rapid and effective wastewater treatment. Oxygen is needed by the bacteria to allow their respiration reactions to proceed rapidly. The oxygen is combined by the bacteria with carbon to form carbon dioxide. Without sufficient oxygen being present, bacteria are not able to quickly biodegrade the incoming organic matter. In the absence of dissolved oxygen, degradation must occur under septic conditions which are slow, odorous and yield incomplete conversions of pollutants. Under septic conditions, some of the carbon will react with hydrogen and sulfur to form sulfuric acid and methane. Other carbon will be converted to organic acids that create low pH conditions in the ponds and make the water more difficult to treat. For example, treated ponds designed to biodegrade wastewater pollutants without oxygen often must hold the incoming sewage for six months or longer to achieve acceptable levels of pollution removal. This is because the biodegradation of organic matter in the absence of oxygen is a very slow kinetic process.\nThe designers of wastewater lagoon systems must take into account the fate of the biological cells, called sludges, that would eventually settle to the pond’s bottom. One advantage to using an aeration system to treat wastewater is the lack of sludge volumes that require treatment. Unlike conventional wastewater treatment plants that must remove excess sludges daily, a pond type system can go from ten to twenty years without ever needing cleaning. This is because, in the presence of sufficient oxygen, bacterial cells that settle to the ponds bottom are eventually biodegraded into carbon dioxide and inert materials. Since a large portion of municipal wastewater consists of biodegradable organic carbon matter, much of the settled sludge in the lagoon can be quickly decomposed by the remaining active bacteria. If sufficient oxygen is not present in the ponds, the sludge layer will accumulate faster than it can be biodegraded. When this occurs, the sludges may build up to a point that it must be removed at a faster rate than would be expected for a pond. This effectively eliminates the main advantage of a lagoon system which is supposed to be an infrequent sludge removal need.\nAdequate aeration is also an important element in keeping the lagoons content mixed and in suspension. Even in a partially-mixed hydraulic regime, mixing is very important to the overall treatment process. With adequate mixing, incoming pollutants and wastewater are better distributed throughout the entire lagoon volume. This results in more uniform and efficient treatment. In addition, solids that settle can be resuspended by the aerator’s mixing action and brought back into contact with the microbial population floating throughout the pond. Poor mixing has the effect of creating thick solids deposits that fall to the lagoon floor before proper treatment has occurred. This causes improperly treated solids to fall away from the active, overhead treatment process. It also creates septic conditions on the lagoon bottom which, in themselves, pull available oxygen out of the upper layers of the pond and reduce the effectiveness of treatment in the upper zone.\nClearly the proper aeration and mixing of a lagoon is critical if the system is to properly treat the influent wastewater pollutants. A plant that has never had proper aeration and mixing will often result in a lot of money spent on electrical power for aeration purposes with little lagoon oxygen to show for this expenditure as well as deep accumulations of partially treated sludge on the lagoons floors which requires frequent removal.\nThe proper oxygenation of a treatment system also has important implications for an emerging wastewater treatment plant toxicity issue. Raw sewage contains large amounts of ammonia (N H3). The typical ammonia concentration of raw sewage is 30 ppm. This ammonia is present as a natural consequence of the degradation of protein-based compounds in wastewater. Nitrogen is a major building block of protein which is present in wastewater due to the discharge of protein based wastewater materials. As the organic compounds that contain protein are degraded, ammonia is released into the raw sewage stream. This is problematic because ammonia has been found to be toxic to aquatic organisms in the water body. In the presence of adequate oxygen, the nitrogen in ammonia can combine with the oxygen to form non-toxic nitrate compounds (NO3-). In order for this reaction to occur, the plant must have sufficient dissolved oxygen available.\nBoth coarse and fine bubble diffused aeration systems transfer oxygen into the water by creating small bubbles. As the bubbles travel through the water, oxygen is transferred across the bubble’s surface and into the water. Mechanical aerators work in the opposite way by creating small droplets of water using a mixer. These droplets are propelled through the atmosphere above the ponds surface. Oxygen in the air is transferred into the small water droplets which then fall back into the water.\nThere are many factors that will act to hinder the transfer of the oxygen load in a wastewater lagoon system. All of these factors must be considered to ensure that sufficient air is added to allow the necessary pounds of oxygen per day to be transferred. Some of these factors include:\nAll of the above factors must be considered collectively to properly size aeration equipment for any treatment system. These factors can be mathematically related to match the actual oxygen requirement (AOR) needed to meet field conditions, with the standard oxygen requirements (SOR), at which aeration equipment is rated in the laboratory. The relationship between AOR and SOR is very important in properly designing a pond’s aeration system. AOR represents the actual amount of oxygen that needs to be added to the ponds under full design loading, full ammonia conversion, and worst case temperature conditions. SOR represents the excess oxygen that must be added in order to make sure that the AOR will be met. Blowers and diffusers are sized on the basis of SOR which represents clean water conditions at 20 degrees Celsius and sea level air pressures. They are purchased on the basis of SOR after first relating the required AOR conditions to SOR conditions.\nHaving determined the standard oxygen requirement of a pond system, it is next important to consider how much air volume in SCFM (standard cubic feet per minute) will be needed to deliver that mass of oxygen. Each cubic foot of air added to the lagoon will contain about 0.0173 pounds of oxygen. The oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE) of a diffuser system is a function of its depth in the ponds. Typically, an OTE of about 1.6% per foot of depth is found for fine bubble diffusers in a pond setting. For a lagoon with ten feet of depth, a transfer efficiency of about 16% could be expected. This means that 16% of the air added at a depth of ten feet will actively be transferred into the water while eighty-four percent will be excess and will bubble to the surface. This seems like an excessive air loss rate, but it is the best now available with current technology.\nWould your wastewater treatment plant benefit by replacing an older aeration system such as coarse bubble diffusion with fine bubble technology? It’s well worth investigating. It is important to understand some critical terms, such as oxygen transfer efficiency and alpha, before beginning your evaluation. The oxygen transfer efficiency of an aeration system is the ratio of the amount of oxygen that actually dissolves into the water to the total amount of oxygen pumped into the water. Only the dissolved oxygen is available for treatment, and any portion of oxygen that does not dissolve is a waste of energy and, therefore, money.\nFinally, aeration basin and aerator layout geometry can dramatically alter oxygen transfer efficiency. Standard clean water transfer efficiency tests are usually based on full floor aerator coverage. This creates a nearly ideal situation for oxygen transfer. A turbulent counter-current flow regime is established with a volume of water being dragged upward with the rising bubbles, being opposed by an equal flow of water traveling downward. In large basins, such as lagoons, full floor coverage is not normally needed to meet the biological aeration demands. As a result of incomplete coverage, large scale currents can form a spiral roll in the basins. The air bubbles flow with the water, which significantly reduces the transfer efficiency. Compared with the full floor configuration, many more air bubbles short-circuit their way to the top of the aeration basin.\nAlthough it may be true that fine bubble systems can provide an appreciable savings in many situations, those who purchase and operate these systems without verification do so at the peril of their own bottom line cost. How can you avoid this pitfall? First, test the system proposed with your wastewater. Do not trust a vendor who does not recommend oxygen transfer testing. Second, make sure that oxygen transfer testing mimics the actual conditions, including the configuration of your basin. The cost of aeration system testing can be high and may not be affordable for many plants. Before testing, the potential cost savings of switching to fine bubble aeration should be evaluated. Literature, vendor, and EPA values for oxygen transfer efficiently and alpha can be used. Find plants with similar wastewater to refine from their experiences the values and contact plants to learn from their experience. If the investment in fine bubble diffusion appears favorable, consider testing before replacing the system.\nWhether it be a plant upgrade or a new facility, a lagoon system will not work well without proper aeration. As sludge disposal regulations become stricter and disposal sites become scarce, proper aeration will reduce the amount of solids that may have to be removed from the lagoons since more of the incoming pollutants will be oxidized.']"	['<urn:uuid:4d7e2dc2-c93c-4659-97a9-728525d13c94>', '<urn:uuid:41dd101a-b183-4d8a-8759-e3cb319dd78c>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	5	105	2305
87	how combine human wisdom artificial intelligence decision making risks benefits	The combination of human wisdom and artificial intelligence in decision-making presents both opportunities and challenges. From the wisdom perspective, wise people possess knowledge, deep understanding, and the flexibility to see issues from multiple perspectives - traits that are valuable in decision-making. However, wisdom requires proper development and can be hindered by overwhelming stress. On the AI side, while it can enhance productivity and improve services, organizations must manage specific risks. These include the explainability challenge (being able to understand how AI makes decisions), the need for independent security testing, and the importance of not expecting too much transformation from AI. Organizations should take a measured approach, applying AI gradually while leveraging human wisdom for oversight and judgment.	"['This release is available in French.\nMontreal, April 6, 2011 Revolution in Libya. Revolution in Egypt. Revolution in Tunisia. The Middle East and North Africa face unprecedented change as dictatorships crumble and people clamor for democracy.\nYet it remains unclear whether these nations will experience more equity under new regimes. The reshaping of societies raises fundamental questions that require monumental thought. ""What the world needs now, especially in these times, is more wisdom,"" observes Dolores Pushkar, a professor in Concordia\'s Department of Psychology and member of the Centre for Research in Human Development.\nWhile all nations need wise leaders, the Middle East and North Africa require sensible leaders with fresh outlooks who are in antithesis to self-serving dictators of the past. ""Since wisdom is defined as something that benefits society as a whole as well as the self,"" continues Pushkar.\nHuman wellbeing and life satisfaction\nCurrent events are on Pushkar\'s mind, since the bulk of her research has focused on human wellbeing and life satisfaction. And she\'s found wisdom plays a central role in both. ""Wisdom and intelligence aren\'t the same thing,"" she points out, estimating that only 5 percent of the population can be described as truly wise and that advanced insight begins after adolescence as the brain matures.\nPushkar recently coauthored an overview on the topic, What Philosophers Say Compared with What Psychologists Find in Discerning Values: How Wise People Interpret Life. Her coauthors include Andrew Burr, Sarah Etezadi and Tracy Lyster of the Concordia Department of Psychology and Sheila Mason of the Department of Philosophy.\nThe research team compiled data from several Concordia studies, as well as international findings, to assess how wisdom shapes life. The result? ""Wisdom has an impact on how people cope in situations and whether they are more or less satisfied with life,"" explains Etezadi, a PhD student under Pushkar\'s direction.\nNo single definition of wisdom exists, but hallmarks include knowledge, deep understanding of human nature, life contentment, empathy and the flexibility to see issues from others\' perspectives. ""Wise people can see the positive side of a negative situation,"" says Etezadi, adding the wise are open to new avenues. ""A practical aspect of wisdom is how it translates to street smarts.""\nInjustice can prevent people from garnering wisdom\nYet studies have shown that overwhelming and prolonged stress, in cases such as genocide or soul-crushing child abuse, are injustices that can prevent people from garnering wisdom. ""The more overwhelming the stress, the greater its magnitude, the less likely people are to develop wisdom from the experience,"" says Pushkar, citing research from peers undertaken after major calamities and wars. ""Chronic adversity can destroy wisdom.""\nPushkar stresses that wise people often espouse common sense but what makes them smarter than most is how they actually follow their own advice. And contrary to popular notions, gender does not influence wisdom. ""For centuries, males had access to education and that\'s how the stereotype of the wise old man came to be,"" says Etezadi.\nAge is another irrelevant factor in life smarts. ""Some people garner wisdom sooner than others,"" Pushkar suggests. ""That\'s why we call them old souls, since they are quicker to learn what leads to a better life.""\nEtezadi and Pushkar, who notably studied life contentment among seniors, also discovered that lifelong optimists are wiser than their pessimistic peers. ""We found that people who are wiser maintain a sense of happiness,"" says Etezadi. ""They are high on wisdom, which has a buffering effect.""\n""Bitterness,"" Pushkar counters, ""disqualifies a person from being considered as wise. It means they haven\'t learned any beneficial lessons from their experience.""\n|Contact: Sylvain-Jacques Desjardins|', 'Your company has started to use Artificial intelligence (AI), but are you effectively managing the risks involved? It’s a new growth channel with the potential to boost productivity and improve customer service. However, particular management risks need to be assessed in cybersecurity. Start by considering AI trends to put this risk in context.\nWhy Is AI an Emerging Cybersecurity Threat?\nArtificial intelligence is a booming industry right now with large corporations, researchers, and startups all scrambling to make the most of the trend. From a cybersecurity perspective, there are a few reasons to be concerned about AI. Your threat assessment models need to be updated based on the following developments.\nEarly Cybersecurity AI May Create a False Sense of Security\nMost machine learning methods currently in production require users to provide a training data set. With this data in place, the application can make better predictions. However, end-user judgment is a major factor in determining which data to include. This “supervised learning” approach is subject to compromise if hackers discover how the supervised process works. In effect, hackers could evade detection by machine learning by mimicking safe code.\nAI-based Cybersecurity Creates More Work for Humans\nFew companies are willing to trust their security to machines. As a result, machine learning in cybersecurity has the effect of creating more work. WIRED magazine summarized this capability as follows: “Machine learning’s most common role, then, is additive. It acts as a sentry, rather than a cure-all.” As AI and machine learning tools flag more and more problems for review, human analysts will need to review this data and make decisions about what to do next.\nHackers Are Starting to Use AI for Attacks\nLike any technology, AI can be used for defense or attack. Researchers at the Stevens Institute of Technology have demonstrated that fact. They used AI to guess 25% of LinkedIn passwords successfully after analyzing 43 million user profiles in 2017. In the hands of defenders, such a tool could help to educate end users on whether they’re using weak passwords. In the hands of attackers, this tool could be used to compromise security.\nThe Mistakes You Need to Know About\nAvoid the following mistakes, and you’re more likely to have success with AI in your organization.\n1. You Haven’t Thought Through the Explainability Challenge\nWhen you use AI, can you explain how it operates and makes recommendations? If not, you may be accepting (or rejecting!) recommendations without being able to assess them. This challenge can be mitigated by reverse engineering the recommendations made by AI.\n2. You Use Vendor-provided AI Without Understanding Their Models\nSome companies decide to buy or license AI from others rather than building the technology in house. As with any strategic decision, there’s a downside to this approach. You can’t trust the vendor’s suggestions that AI will be beneficial blindly. You need to ask tough questions about how the systems protect your data and what systems AI tools can access. Overcome this challenge by asking your vendors to explain their assumptions about data and machine learning.\n3. You Don’t Test AI Security Independently\nWhen you use an AI or machine learning tool, you need to entrust a significant amount of data to it. To trust the system, it must be tested from a cybersecurity perspective. For example, consider whether the system can be compromised by SQL injection or other hacking techniques. If a hacker can compromise the algorithm or data in an AI system, the quality of your company’s decision making will suffer.\n4. Your Organization Lacks AI Cybersecurity Skills\nTo carry out AI cybersecurity tests and evaluations, you need skilled staff. Unfortunately, there are relatively few cyber professionals who are competent in security and AI. Fortunately, this mistake can be overcome with a talent development program. Offer your cybersecurity professionals the opportunity to earn certificates, attend conferences, and use other resources to increase their AI knowledge.\n5. You Avoid Using AI Completely for Security Reasons\nBased on the previous mistakes, you might assume that avoiding AI and machine learning completely is a smart move. That might’ve been an option a decade ago, but AI and machine learning are now part of every tool you use at work. Attempting to minimize AI risk by ignoring this technology trend will only expose your organization to greater risk. It’s better to seek proactive solutions that leverage AI. For instance, you can use security chatbots such as Apollo to make security more convenient for your staff.\n6. You Expect too Much Transformation from AI\nGoing into an AI implementation with unreasonable expectations will cause security and productivity problems. Resist the urge to apply AI to every business problem in the organization. Such a broad implementation would be very difficult to monitor from a security point of view. Instead, take the low-risk approach: apply AI for one area at a time, such as automating routine security administration tasks, and then build from there.\n7. Holding Back Real Data from Your AI Solution\nMost developers and technologists like to reduce risk by setting up test environments. It’s a sound discipline and well worth using. However, when it comes to AI, this approach has its limits. To find out whether your AI system is truly secure, you need to feed it real data: customer information, financial data, or something else. If all this information is held back, you’ll never be able to assess the security risks or productivity benefits of embracing AI.\nAdopt AI with an Eyes Wide Open Perspective\nThere are certainly dangers and risks associated with using AI in your company. However, these risks can be monitored and managed through training, proactive management oversight, and avoiding these seven mistakes.']"	['<urn:uuid:79b2a8f1-0906-47a7-ae22-247a777c4991>', '<urn:uuid:75c20593-63bc-45e3-ac40-3a0820eb44e8>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	10	117	1550
88	historical religious buildings maritime provinces development importance	In Atlantic Canada's religious architectural history, two churches stand as significant landmarks. Saint George's Church in Halifax, completed in 1812, holds importance for its spiritual significance to the community and its unique status as Canada's oldest Lutheran Church and Nova Scotia's third oldest Anglican Church. It was built to accommodate a growing congregation that had outgrown the Little Dutch Church. The Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague Church in Richibucto, built in 1964-65, represents a more recent development, replacing an 1864 structure. It is considered one of the most remarkable churches of the Modern Movement in Atlantic Canada, demonstrating the continuation of the tradition of building impressive religious monuments. Both structures remain important to their communities' spiritual fabric and showcase the evolution of religious architecture in the Maritime provinces.	"[""Links and documents\n1964/01/01 to 1965/01/01\nListed on the Canadian Register:\nStatement of Significance\nDescription of Historic Place\nThe Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague Church is a modern circular building, covered in limestone, with an undulating concrete roof. It is located on Main Street in Richibucto.\nThe Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague Church is designated as a Local Historic Place for its architecture and for its use as a place of worship.\nThis architectural gem is representative of a long and ancient tradition of building impressive religious monuments. It is one of the most remarkable churches of the Modern Movement in Atlantic Canada and even in all of Canada. This ultra modern structure was built in 1964-65. Its elegant roof consists of twelve parabolic groin vaults of varying heights in gradation that contains stained glass windows. The form of the building is circular and the walls are covered in cut limestone. Its steeple consists of a separate concrete tower that is joined to the main building by a portico. One can imagine symbols of the sea reflected in the church’s architecture: the undulating form of the roof which resemble the waves of the sea (as well as a scallop shell) and its bell tower that resembles a lighthouse. However, these symbols weren’t the inspiration for the church’s architects. The influence of the Los Manantiales restaurant in Xochimiloc, Mexico, would not have been lost on the architects of the church. The restaurant, designed by Félix Candela and built in 1958, was one of the most publicized examples of modern architecture at the time. Nevertheless, the main stained glass window which rises behind the altar depicts a fishing scene. On the interior, the pews form semi-circles around the altar. They can accommodate 700 people.\nThe architectural firm responsible for the church was Bélanger et Roy of Moncton, with Arcade Albert as its design architect. The building contractor for the Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague church was Pelletier Construction Co. Ltée of Trois-Rivières, Québec.

The Church is a national landmark and is commonly known as the ‘Round Church.’ Its round construction makes it unique within the province. The municipal heritage designation applies to the Church, Hall and the land.\nSaint George’s Church is valued for its age and spiritual importance to the community. The construction of Saint George's Church was completed in 1812. It was built to accommodate a congregation that had outgrown its original church, the Little Dutch Church, which was formerly a Lutheran parish. The conversion from Lutheran to Anglican instantly made Saint George's Church the oldest Lutheran Church in Canada and the third oldest Anglican Church in Nova Scotia. The Church and Church Hall have been important to the spiritual fabric of society in Halifax in the building of religious communities.\nThe Church is also valued for its design, construction, and for its association with the British Royal Family. It is the only Church designed by a member of the Royal Family, Prince Edward, the Duke of Kent. The design of Saint George's Church follows the circular pattern of architecture that the Duke of Kent favoured at the time. The plans of Saint George's Church are said to have been prepared by William Hughes, a master builder and shipwright at the Halifax dockyards. The design is believed to have been the responsibility of many people, including John Merrick, the principal architect of Province House in Halifax. The cornerstone was laid by Sir John Wentworth, the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia on April 10, 1800. The original part of the Church was constructed between 1800 and 1812 and consisted of a simple two storey circular form with three domes. The weathervane was placed on top of the cupola in 1835 and is modelled after Halley's Comet which was viewed that year. The gallery was extended in 1841 to accommodate more people. The basic outline of the church has not changed since its construction, with the exception of repairs and maintenance on the structure, including repairs following the 1917 Halifax Explosion.\nArchitecturally, Saint George’s Church is valued for its unique Georgian style and design. The Church has been restored after a major fire in 1994 damaged the cupola, roof, and interior dome. The architectural character of this building is defined by its round shape with its staged roof structure, and by the round-ended chancel on the western side of the building. The wooden construction of the building is essential to its character. The round Palladian form of Saint George’s Church is pivotal to the meaning of this truly remarkable example of the Georgian style. There are grand entrance porticos, towers, and apsidal ends. The Church also features balustrades and a Palladian style window behind the altar. The storey articulation of the walls has low flat or segmental windows under tall round-headed windows. The Church Hall is also in the Georgian style, but of simple design. This simplicity further enhances the architectural importance of the Church.\nSource: HRM Heritage Property File 2222 Brunswick Street, Saint George's Church, found at HRM Planning and Development Services, Heritage Property Program, 6960 Mumford Road, Halifax, Nova Scotia.\nThe character-defining elements of Saint George's Church include:\n- Georgian style with round Palladian shape;\n- dominant central round two storey dome;\n- staged roof structure;\n- round-ended chancel with round headed windows;\n- rectangular vestry, organ loft, and entrance to either side of the chancel;\n- wooden construction and shingle siding;\n- cupola roofed in copper;\n- rounded headed windows;\n- dentils along the eaves;\n- arched openings at gallery level;\n- sash windows of twelve-over-twelve.\nThe character-defining elements of the Church Hall include:\n- simple Georgian form;\n- steeply pitched gable roof;\n- single cross gable;\n- timber frame;\n- wood shingle cladding.""]"	['<urn:uuid:7b5ace99-8648-4f99-85f6-6b38bd123a29>', '<urn:uuid:5d09359d-055f-4648-b5a1-95c43663f292>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	7	124	1175
89	agave plant water needs sweetener health effects	The Agave Salmiana is highly drought-resistant, requiring only infrequent watering, making it perfect for xeriscaping. However, while its derived sweetener (agave syrup) might seem like a natural alternative, it should be avoided due to its extremely high fructose content (up to 92%), which can cause health problems, particularly for people with fructose malabsorption.	['The Agave Salmiana is a very large growing succulent that may also be referred to as the Giant Agave. These plants can grow to heights of 6 feet and may have a total diameter of 12 feet, with large flat green leaves. They are tropical, tender perennials that grow rather well in any warm climate. Originally these plants were cultivated in central Mexico, but today they can be purchased and shipped to any part of the world. Agave plants prefer warm tropical growing environments with access to full sunlight or partial shade. They are listed between 8b and 11 on the USDA Hardiness scale meaning they are hardy from 15 degrees F to above 40 degrees F.\nIt is best to not allow these plants to be subjected to cold temperatures. Agave Salmiana plants grow well in relatively poor soil conditions provided that the soil has good drainage. The roots will not handle too much moisture. Because these plants grow to be large in size, they need the proper amount of spacing when planted near other plants, usually about 10-12 feet apart. While these plants have fewer spines than most types of Agave plants, they do have sharp points on the tips of their flat leaves, which may be dangerous. It is a good idea to cut off these points to avoid accidental stabbings.\nAgave Salmiana plants can be easily purchased from garden centers or online distribution stores. They can also be propagated by dividing the rhizomes, tubers, corms or bulbs.\nIf these plants are grown in pots they will often produce smaller agave plants at the bottom of the pot which may be easily increased in size when removed. In the garden the agave plant propagates through pup suckers and seeds. Seeds can also be collected by allowing the pods to dry and shaking off the seeds. Salmianas will only flower after they have reached about 15 years of age. The huge flower stalk will bloom in mid-summer and may grow to 20-40 feet in height. Its flowers are rather inconspicuous and the plant will die back after each bloom, leaving behind a vast array of suckers that will produce a replacement plant. This ability to be such a quality and large producing plant has made them a favorite with commercial growers.\nOne of the Agave Salmiana plants best attributes is its low water needs. It requires only infrequent watering and is a very drought hardy plant. This is one of the reasons that agaves are used in xeriscaping. This type of landscaping uses no supplemental irrigation and is perfect for areas with low access to water or areas that have been affected by climate change. The goal of xeriscaping to use specific plants and soil types that require little water and techniques to avoid losing water to evaporation or runoff. Because of their extreme resistance to drought conditions, agaves are often used in xeriscaping along with other low water plants like junipers, cactus, lavender and sedums.\nThe Giant Agave plant looks great in any landscape design. They are easy to care for and propagate and can handle some really tough environmental conditions. These plants help to create depth in the garden and have large a powerful appearance because of their size and shape. They can also be easily grown in less humid environments as long as they receive the proper amount of sunlight and have plenty of draining capacity for the roots. This makes them great for indoor pots and window gardens. Because of their size, shape and very sharp points, take care and be cautious when working near or handling these plants to avoid injury.', 'You would think that if you had fructose malabsorption that you should forsake sugar forever. Now that actually is a good idea and your health would be all the better for it. There is all sorts of information coming out now about the dangers of sugar – here, here and here. However, many of us are going to crave a little sweetness every now and then and, since fruit has to be restricted, we will turn to our own baking.\nBut not all sugars are equal. For many, honey is healthy and the only sweetener they will use. I used to think that too and used it in all my baking. Big mistake – honey is high in fructose. But let’s start at the beginning and analyze the main sugars from the point of view of those on a low FODMAP diet.\nSugars you can use – though always in moderation.\nSucrose – common table sugar\nA crystalline disaccharide of fructose and glucose, C12H22O11, found in many plants but extracted as ordinary sugar mainly from sugar cane and sugar beets, widely used as a sweetener. (Source)\nTable sugar (including raw sugar, caster sugar and icing sugar – though make sure it doesn’t contain any wheat flour) has equal amounts of fructose and glucose. Those with fructose malabsorption lack the enzyme which helps absorb fructose into the system but glucose can do the job instead. As long as there are equal quantities of fructose and glucose, the fructose will be absorbed. Glucose is our friend. But there is still a limit for us folk before the glucose gives up and lets the rest of the fructose go on down into the bowel where it ferments and causes all sorts of problems. So be judicious and eat a small piece of your baking. And definitely don’t eat baking from a supermarket or bakery. You have no idea what sugar they have used. If you don’t bake, then start now or stop eating sweet food. No other choices.\n1. A monosaccharide sugar, C6H12O6, occurring widely in most plant and animal tissue. It is the principal circulating sugar in the blood and the major energy source of the body.\n2. A colorless to yellowish syrupy mixture of dextrose, maltose, and dextrins containing about 20 percent water, used in confectionery and alcoholic fermentation. (Source)\nI have found it almost impossible to find glucose locally even at specialist shops and have given up but if you can find it, it is one of the safer sugars for you to use because it is a monosaccharide and contains no fructose.\n1. Unrefined or incompletely refined sugar that still retains some molasses, which gives it a brownish color.\n2. A commercial product made by the addition of molasses to white sugar. (Source)\nBrown sugar is basically like table sugar with the addition of a little molasses, which is a by-product of the refining of sugar. Molasses is a very little bit higher in fructose than glucose so go easy on brown sugar but the overflow of fructose is very tiny. It does add a lovely caramelly flavour to baking. By the way, use no. 1 in the above definition and not number two, which is far too processed.\nA light golden-coloured treacle produced by the evaporation of cane sugar juice, used to sweeten and flavour cakes, puddings, etc. (Source)\nGolden syrup is used extensively in New Zealand and Australia but less in the US. So this is readily available for me. Like brown sugar, it has a tiny fraction more fructose than glucose so go easy but it is lovely to use in baking and can be used as a substitute for honey in recipes.\n1. A sweet syrup made from the sap of the sugar maple.\n2. Syrup made from various sugars and flavored with maple syrup or artificial maple flavoring. (Source)\nPlease look at no.2 in the definition and never ever be fooled into buying it. Who knows what those various sugars are and why use something which is so processed. If you love the flavour of maple syrup, use the real stuff or abstain. It is rather expensive here in New Zealand so I don’t use a lot of it but it is a safe source of sweetness for us.\nWant an accurate Low Fodmap Diet Food Chart?\nFill in your details to access it\nI value your privacy and would never spam you\nSugars you should avoid like the plague.\nAgave syrup is a sweetener commercially produced from several species of agave, including Agave tequilana (blue agave) and Agave salmiana. Agave nectar is sweeter than honey and tends to be thinner and flow more freely than it. Most agave nectar comes from Mexico and South Africa. Agave nectar consists primarily of fructose and glucose. One source gives 92% fructose and 8% glucose; another gives 56% fructose and 20% glucose. These differences probably reflect variation from one vendor of agave nectar to another. (Source)\nLook at those percentages of fructose! Ouch!! Don’t get fooled into thinking that agave is a healthy sugar – it isn’t. Stay away from that stuff or you will regret it. Read this article on the Huffington post written by Dr Mercola on agave syrup and the dangers of fructose:\nHoney is a sweet food made by bees using nectar from flowers. The variety produced by honey bees is the one most commonly referred to, as it is the type of honey collected by beekeepers and consumed by humans. Honey produced by other bees and insects has distinctly different properties. Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, and has approximately the same relative sweetness as that of granulated sugar. (Source)\nTypical honey analysis:\nHigher sugars: 1.5%\nSo the fructose content is higher than the glucose. It’s simple – don’t eat honey, unless you want problems of the unpleasant kind.\nHigh-Fructose Corn Syrup\nHigh-fructose corn syrup (HFCS)—also called glucose/fructose in Canada,Isoglucose or Glucose-Fructose syrup and high-fructose maize syrup in other countries—comprises any of a group of corn syrups that has undergone enzymatic processing to convert some of its glucose into fructose to produce a desired sweetness.\nDue to US-imposed tariffs, in the United States sugar prices are two to three times higher than in the rest of the world, which makes HFCS significantly cheaper, so that it is the principal sweetener used in processed foods and beverages. It is commonly used in breads, cereals, breakfast bars, lunch meats, yogurts, soft drinks, soups, and condiments.\nHFCS consists of 24% water, and the rest sugars. The most widely used varieties of HFCS are: HFCS 55 (mostly used in soft drinks), approximately 55% fructose and 42% glucose; and HFCS 42 (used in beverages, processed foods, cereals and baked goods), approximately 42% fructose and 53% glucose. HFCS-90, approximately 90% fructose and 10% glucose, is used in small quantities for specialty applications, but primarily is used to blend with HFCS 42 to make HFCS 55. (Source)\nThat might have been long-winded but the bottom line is that HFCS is cheap and so food manufacturers use it extensively in processed food to give it flavour. This stuff is dynamite for us fructose malabsorbers in particular but also for people in general. This is dangerous for the health of the human race. Dramatic but true. Stay away from processed foods and therefore HFCS and you will be doing your body the biggest favour of your life. Read about it in this article written by Mark Hyman, MD.\nNow you can make the decision – are you strong and wise enough to give up sugar altogether or must you eat something sweet each day? I fall into the latter category although I am finding that I am baking more savoury goods and I am feeling quite satisfied with them and I don’t miss the sugar as much as I thought I would. But if you do want to bake something sweet, use only those mentioned above.']	['<urn:uuid:bfe0b988-4283-454d-956c-ba963ba1a306>', '<urn:uuid:95156716-d6f3-40d1-8a04-38fa0934ed7d>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	7	53	1937
90	undercarriage cost percentage purchase price	The undercarriage can make up almost 20% of a tracked machine's purchase price and nearly 50% of its maintenance costs over its service life.	"['Check track tension regularly. Running too tight or too loose can create problems.\nPhoto credit: Caterpillar\nOEM tracks are a better option than aftermarket replacement brands.\nPhoto credit: Takeuchi Mfg.\nThe undercarriage is the most costly part of any tracked machine and can make up almost 20% of its purchase price and nearly 50% of its maintenance costs over its service life.\nPhoto credit: Bobcat\nThe undercarriage life expectancy of a compact track loader is subject to too many variables to predict with any degree of accuracy. But you can measure its life against various baselines to get an idea if costs are running out of control.\nMike Fitzgerald, Bobcat loader product specialist, estimates the average life of rubber tracks to be between 1,200 and 1,600 hours. However, it depends on the operating conditions and the application.\n""Rental machines will have tracks last in the 800- to 1,200-hour range. Some severe-duty applications that are more abusive to tracks may get less than 800 hours,"" he points out, adding that contractors performing only earthwork might see track life in the 1,600- to 2,000-hour range. ""I recently looked at a machine that had just under 1,800 hours of use. The tracks were only 50% worn, but the loader had not done a significant amount of work on streets or parking lots. That machine is used for backfilling dirt around building sites.""\nAccording to Cameron Stejskal, product specialist, Terex Construction Americas, ""There are four main factors that affect undercarriage wear: application, underfoot condition, operating technique and maintenance practices. Wear and tear is directly affected by operator knowledge and the operating conditions.""\nThe undercarriage is the most costly part of any tracked machine; it can make up almost 20% of its purchase price and nearly 50% of maintenance costs over its service life. ""Such valuable components should never be neglected,"" Stejskal emphasizes. ""It is extremely important to keep the undercarriage clean. This helps ensure longevity of components and keeps operating costs down.""\nTrack maintenance - which includes proper tensioning, cleaning and inspection - should be done on a regular basis. ""Follow the schedule in the operator\'s manual,"" says David Steger, national product and training manager, Takeuchi, ""but undercarriage inspections should be more frequent when in muddy or abrasive conditions.""\nCheck for uneven wear. ""The components are designed to wear evenly,"" says Stejskal. ""If some components wear more quickly than others, it can affect the productivity and wear all of the components.""\nKeeping the machine clean will make it easier to identify potential problems, and decrease wear due to debris lodged between components. Cohesive and abrasive materials such as mud, clay and gravel should be cleaned out as often as possible.\n""At the end of the day, knock away any debris that\'s accumulated in the tracks, and then while the machine is still warm, wash it down to get rid of any remaining materials that could cause corrosion or contamination,"" says Stejskal. ""The end of the day wash-down process is a good time to remove embedded foreign objects from the tracks and lubricate all moving parts. The daily wash down is also an excellent time to look for any loose, worn, cracked, bent or missing components.""\nIt\'s also the perfect time to check the track for cuts, punctures or tears. ""Sprockets and rollers should be inspected to ensure they are in good condition with no damage, excessive wear or \'flat spotting,\' which may be an indication of material buildup or bearing seizure"" advises Steger. ""Any oil leakage from rollers, hoses or travel motors should be repaired immediately. It is recommended to replace the sprockets each time new tracks are installed.""\nCheck track tension regularly. Running too tight or too loose creates problems. ""If you run tracks too tight, you will use more power and cause premature wear because they are tighter and there is more friction,"" notes Fitzgerald. ""If you run in sand or small granular material, a tight track will force that material between the metal parts and wear on them.""\nIt is best to err a little on the loose side. ""If you want to run to one side or the other within the specification, our recommendation would be to run them slightly on the loose side, because running on the tight side really doesn\'t do much for you,"" says Fitzgerald. ""If they are loose, the material will shed better. However, if they are way too loose, the tracks will come off. You can go too far.""\nThe operating environment can be a contributing factor in premature component wear. ""For rubber tracks containing steel imbeds and cords, salty environments can contribute to accelerated track wear due to the corrosive nature of salt and airborne water vapor containing salt,"" says Kevin Coleman, senior marketing project engineer for Caterpillar\'s Building Construction Products Group. Remove salt deposits by washing at your earliest opportunity.\nJust by cleaning the tracks, maintaining the proper tension and inspecting on a regular basis, you can reduce operating costs significantly.\nNo matter how well you take care of your CTL\'s tracks, there will come a time when they need to be replaced. Several things should be considered when doing so. ""Improper tension, improper operation and/or derailment can all cause damage to the rubber carcass and the internal structure of the track,"" says Kevin Coleman, ""Once the track can no longer maintain proper tension and/or efficiently transfer power to the ground, it may be time for a replacement.""\nUse of aftermarket (non-OEM) tracks or undercarriage parts can contribute to track failure, as well. ""Some aftermarket tracks are not made with the same rigorous standards as OEM parts,"" says Coleman. ""Manufacturing processes and rubber compounds have a huge affect on the quality of the track being purchased. OEM parts have been designed and tested to work with your machine to produce maximum machine productivity and maximum track life. Aftermarket tracks may cost less, but you get what you pay for and the life you achieve will likely be proportional to the cost.""\nStejskal agrees, noting, ""I strongly advise our customers to stay with OEM tracks. Aftermarket tracks do not fit properly - the track is either too long and you are halfway out of track adjustment right away, or the tracks are too short and they are extremely hard to get on, if you can get them on at all. In addition, some aftermarket tracks do not mesh with the sprockets properly; when this happens, you start to damage that track.""\nSteger adds, ""Aftermarket replacement tracks can sometimes be cheaper to purchase, but be aware that the quality of tracks varies. When shopping, consider the total operating cost of the component. A cheaper initial purchase may add up to higher cost per hour over the OEM brand when factoring variables such as initial cost, life expectancy, machine downtime, replacement labor and warranty/support.""\nBobcat actually offers two different types of rubber tracks for its loaders. ""We have the OEM track that we send out of the factory,"" notes Fitzgerald. ""Through our parts operation we also offer a less-expensive alternative track, which meets original design specifications, but will not have the same life due to differences in the rubber content or compound. It is lower cost, but it is not going to last as long.""\nBobcat does caution users to beware of many aftermarket alternatives. ""It is very critical to have the right length and pitch of track so it matches properly with the sprockets,"" says Fitzgerald. ""If it doesn\'t match you will prematurely wear either the metal imbeds, the sprocket on the machine, or both."" It is also important to note that a less costly track will probably utilize lighter weight components. ""You may run into problems with either cables in the track or imbeds breaking prematurely."" In addition, they may be more prone to cracking, cutting and chunking.\nBobcat offers steel tracks as an option to the traditional rubber tracks fitted on most of today\'s compact track loaders. These tracks expand the capability of compact track loaders into applications where rubber track life is an issue.\n""The request came from people who were seeing premature wear or low hour life on rubber tracks,"" says Fitzgerald. For instance, demolition contractors like how compact track loaders perform, but jagged asphalt or concrete is better suited to steel tracks. Steel is also better for use in applications with jagged rock underfoot conditions.\nThe performance of steel tracks can make them a better choice for many earthmoving applications, as well. ""Rough site work is more conducive to steel tracks,"" says Fitzgerald. A rubber track machine can then be brought in for the finish work.\n""The steel track is somewhat heavier, although it is shorter in length and ground contact area,"" says Fitzgerald. ""You can push more with a steel track because you have more weight, as long as you are on a solid underfoot surface. If you are in soft underfoot conditions, there are more pounds per square inch, so the steel tracks may sink in more. A wider rubber track would allow you to float on top better.\n""In order to justify the additional cost of steel tracks, you basically have to figure they are going to last about two and a half times as long as a set of rubber tracks,"" says Fitzgerald. ""That is kind of a rule of thumb.""']"	['<urn:uuid:d68dec94-3a11-46ee-b71a-7fd19f7314fd>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	5	24	1555
91	I'm a dental educator and I'm curious about the specific distribution of teeth types on the bottom jaw - can you provide a detailed breakdown of how many incisors, canines, and premolars adults typically have on their lower jaw?	On the bottom jaw, adults have 16 teeth in total. This includes eight incisors which are the front teeth used for cutting and biting into food, four canines which are the sharp, pointed teeth used for tearing and grasping food, and four premolars (also known as bicuspids) which are located behind the canines and have flat surfaces with two points called cusps for chewing and grinding food.	['How Many Teeth Do Adults Have on the Bottom?\nThe adult human mouth is home to a total of 32 teeth, which are evenly distributed on the top and bottom jaws. Specifically, on the bottom jaw, adults have 16 teeth. These include eight incisors, four canines, and four premolars.\n1. What are incisors?\nIncisors are the four front teeth on the bottom jaw. They are used for cutting and biting into food.\n2. What are canines?\nThe canines are the sharp, pointed teeth located on either side of the incisors. They are used for tearing and grasping food.\n3. What are premolars?\nPremolars, also known as bicuspids, are the teeth located behind the canines. They have a flat surface with two points called cusps, which aid in chewing and grinding food.\n4. Are there any molars on the bottom jaw?\nNo, molars are located at the back of the mouth and are found on both the top and bottom jaws. They are used for crushing and grinding food.\n5. Can adults have more or fewer teeth on the bottom jaw?\nThe number of teeth in the adult mouth is consistent, with 16 teeth on the bottom jaw and 16 on the top jaw, bringing the total to 32 teeth.\n6. Are wisdom teeth included in the count?\nNo, the count of adult teeth does not include wisdom teeth. Wisdom teeth, also known as third molars, typically erupt in late adolescence or early adulthood. However, not everyone develops wisdom teeth, and some may require extraction due to complications.\n7. Can missing teeth be replaced?\nYes, missing teeth can be replaced with various options such as dental implants, bridges, or dentures. It is important to consult with a dentist to determine the most suitable option for each individual case.\n8. What is the purpose of having different types of teeth?\nThe different types of teeth serve specific functions in the chewing process. Incisors are essential for cutting food, canines aid in tearing, premolars assist in chewing, and molars are responsible for grinding food into smaller particles for digestion.\n9. What happens if a tooth is lost and not replaced?\nIf a tooth is lost and not replaced, several complications may arise. Adjacent teeth may shift, causing misalignment and bite issues. The jawbone can also deteriorate over time due to lack of stimulation from the missing tooth root.\n10. How can I maintain good oral health for my bottom teeth?\nMaintaining good oral hygiene is crucial for the health of your bottom teeth. Brushing twice daily with a fluoride toothpaste, flossing regularly, and visiting your dentist for check-ups and cleanings are key to preventing dental issues.\n11. What causes tooth loss in adults?\nTooth loss in adults can be caused by various factors, including tooth decay, gum disease, trauma, and poor oral hygiene. Other factors such as smoking, certain medical conditions, and genetic predisposition can also contribute to tooth loss.\n12. Can adults get braces to correct alignment issues with their bottom teeth?\nYes, adults can get braces to correct alignment issues with their bottom teeth. There are various orthodontic options available, including traditional metal braces, clear aligners, and lingual braces. However, it is essential to consult with an orthodontist to determine the most suitable treatment plan.\nIn conclusion, adults have 16 teeth on the bottom jaw, including incisors, canines, and premolars. Maintaining good oral hygiene, regular dental check-ups, and addressing tooth loss promptly are vital for a healthy smile. If you have any concerns about your bottom teeth, it is advisable to consult with a dentist or orthodontist for professional advice and treatment.']	['<urn:uuid:13c88b25-637b-471b-b743-debfecbc8eca>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	39	67	601
92	hurricane damage caribbean coastal economies impact	The recent Category 5 hurricanes caused major disruptions to Caribbean coastal economies, particularly affecting fishing and tourism sectors. In the Turks and Caicos Islands, almost 90 percent of infrastructure and housing stock in Providenciales was compromised, while coral reefs, which are integral to the economies of many Caribbean small island states through tourism and fisheries, were also affected.	"['(Pictured above) Damage to homes in the Turks and Caicos Islands following the passage of two Category 5 hurricanes. (S. St. Hill/BGIS)\nWhen an RSS2 aircraft touched down at the Providenciales International Airport in the Turks and Caicos Islands a few weeks ago, it was the continuation of a series of visits to the various islands severely impacted by the recent passing of two Category 5 hurricanes.\nOn board was Prime Minister of Grenada and Chairman of CARICOM, Dr. Keith Mitchell; CARICOM Secretary General, Ambassador Irwin LaRocque; Executive Director of the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA), Ronald Jackson; Attorney General of Barbados and Minister of Home Affairs, Adriel Brathwaite; and Executive Director of the Regional Security System (RSS) Captain Errington Shurland.\nA British territory, the Turks and Caicos is an associate member state of CARICOM.\nThe delegation was met by the Premier of Turks and Caicos, Sharlene Cartwright-Robinson, who briefed the officials on the situation on the ground. She disclosed that although there was severe damage throughout the territory, and, in particular, the island of South Caicos, there was no loss of life or major public health challenges.\nThe Premier also reassured the region and international community that her country was “resilient”, and that there was law and order.\nMrs. Cartwright-Robinson further explained that almost 90 percent of the infrastructure and housing stock in Providenciales had been compromised. The team, along with local media personnel, visited an elementary school, one of many which served as shelter for local residents. Although the school was damaged, it provided a place of refuge for those who lost almost everything.\nThe next stop on the tour was The Bahamas. Of particular interest was Ragged Island, a quaint lobster and conch fishing community of approximately 80 persons, located about 50 minutes by plane from the main island of New Providence.\nThe entire island was decimated by the unforgiving winds of Hurricane Irma. All the power lines were down, a reality made even more poignant by the fact that the country only received electrical services 15 years ago. Only 13 persons chose to remain on the island to pick up the pieces of their lives and rebuild the community.\nFollowing the tours, Mr. Jackson noted that all of the islands affected have had major disruptions to the mainstays of their local economies, namely fishing and tourism. However, he stated that the recovery and reconstruction process was ongoing and efforts by the regional agencies were proving successful.\nIn his remarks to the media, Ambassador LaRocque reiterated CARICOM’s firm commitment to supporting the rebuilding of the nations affected by the recent hurricanes. He said that CARICOM was “fully behind them” and would continue to advocate in the international community on their behalf through the implementation of the Donors Conference – a group of international donors that would help raise funds to assist the affected countries.\nCARICOM’s Chairman, Dr. Mitchell, also gave his commitment to the continued support of the regional agencies and praised CDEMA and the RSS for their hard work and dedication to the services rendered to these nations.\nCDEMA and the RSS collaborated to mobilise the CARICOM Disaster Relief Unit (CDRU). The CDRU is a recce team which comprises regional military, police and fire personnel to access the impacted areas and make recommendations on how best to coordinate and commence the relief efforts. The RSS aircraft and team play an instrumental role in transporting the regional high-level ministerial staff along with the CDRU to the affected areas.\nBarbados’ Attorney General, Adriel Brathwaite, also reaffirmed his country’s support to the region during these times of difficulties. Barbados continues to play a major role in the deployment of teams from the Barbados Defence Force, the Department of Emergency Management, medical and other technical personnel to assist in the continuing relief efforts. The Barbados Coast Guard vessel, HMBS Rudyard Lewis, currently makes relief trips to the islands.', ""Coral reefs are a vital part of the Caribbean’s marine environment, and are integral to the economies of many of the region’s small island states. WRI's economic valuation methodology can help decision-makers in the region better understand the enormous economic value the reef provides and use this data to make better-informed coastal policy.\nClick here to view the full results.\nTourists flock to the region to see the beautiful beaches and marine life these biologically rich habitats support. Local fishermen rely on healthy reefs as a source of food and livelihood. In addition, reefs act as natural barriers to protect the islands from the worst ravages of tropical storms.\nThe proper management of the Caribbean’s Coastal Capital is essential for the region’s economic and environmental health.\nYet government officials, developers and the public often overlook or do not fully appreciate the harmful effects coral reef degradation, resulting in short-sighted decisions about coastal investment, development and land use. Knowledge of the economic values stemming from coral reefs supports sustainable planning which maximizes the long-term economic potential of coastal areas.\nBut a clear presentation of the economic value derived from coral reefs can guide the sustainable use of these resources.\nThe World Resources Institute, in collaboration with government and NGO partners in St. Lucia, Tobago and Belize, has developed an economic valuation methodology to quantify the value of coral reefs in the Caribbean more accurately. The methodology supports the evaluation of trade-offs, thereby highlighting the management and development paths which protect coral reefs, and maximize the economic contribution of coral reefs to the economy.\nOur Excel-based Economic Valuation Tool guides users through a simple method that does not assess Total Economic Value (TEV), but instead focuses on three key goods and services: coral reef-associated tourism, fisheries, and shoreline protection services. Read more about the methodology\nThe tool evaluates the economic impact of both coral reef-associated tourism and fisheries with a financial analysis method that tracks the financial flows and wider economic impact these two industries generate.\nShoreline protection is the third aspect of the Economic Valuation Tool. WRI developed an innovative method for evaluating the role of coral reefs in protecting the shoreline. Using a modified avoided damages approach, the tool estimates the total value of reduction in wave-induced erosion and property damage due to coral reefs.\nCountries across the Caribbean can use the methodology; and the hope is that its widespread use will support wise, forward-looking coastal policy throughout the region.\nWRI has made lower bound (partial) estimates of the economic contribution of coral reefs to the economy of two pilot sites in the Eastern Caribbean: Tobago and St. Lucia. On these two small islands, coral reef tourism alone accounted for direct and indirect economic impact totaling US$101–130 million in Tobago and US$ 160–194 million in St. Lucia.\nUltimately, WRI hopes the project will:\n- Increase local capacity to perform ecosystem valuation and use the valuation results in planning and decision-making;\n- Make the economic case for better coastal and land management, as well as for increased investment in Marine Protected Areas, so that these are viewed as investments for the economic and societal benefits of the country;\n- Arm NGOs and marginalized resource users with powerful information, giving them a greater voice in local decision-making.\nFor a quick summary of the results, click here.

93	what buddha say about happiness benefit many	The Buddha directed his first awakened disciples to spread his teachings 'for the welfare and benefit of the many, for the happiness and bliss of the many' (bahujana hitāya, bahujana sukhāya).	['The blessed Buddha came into our world and, realizing awakening, taught for our long-term benefit and happiness (Pāli: amhākaṃ digharattaṃ hitāya sukhāya.)* These words of the Buddha were not a new idea; they are an ancient quote. But the depth of understanding that could lead to such human experience was new in his time; or as he himself put it, it was ancient buddha-knowledge that had been lost to humanity, which he rediscovered. We are in need of such a rediscovery now—to regain clarity about what is to be done for our individual and collective human welfare, as it is deeply interrelated with the welfare of all of life. This is at the heart of the dispensation of the Buddha’s teachings, which he directed his first awakened disciples to spread “for the welfare and benefit of the many, for the happiness and bliss of the many”—bahujana hitāya, bahujana sukhāya.**\nAs a young person growing up in the United States, I felt a deep concern for what I perceived as a tendency to be in “the rat race,” with most everyone running after something unattainable and likely to run us over the cliff. This mad race of ever-increasing consumption, and with it, ever-increasing waste, seemed dangerous and destructive (well illustrated in this video). Greed and exploitation seem to be being valorized and given increasing moral value.\nWith it came what felt like a degenerate idea of us as human beings, with our human value defined in terms of being ideal “producers” and “consumers.” But what was really the ideal was very unclear other than that it involved perpetual striving after something that seemed illusory (like a rat running in a wheel), thus creating and perpetuating endless seeking and dissatisfaction driven by a corrupt thirst for consumer power and consumption. The other thing that seemed clear was that this behavior and these dynamics were destructive—toxic to our environment and to us humans.\nThese concerns led me to seek wisdom and understanding, and engendered a keenly felt need to bring forth that wisdom again into our modern world.\nInsight into conditional causation and cessation\nOne of the key elements of the Buddha’s crucial insight and one of the great strengths of the Buddha’s teachings lies at the heart of the Dhamma. This is the teaching on conditional causation.\nYe dhammā hetuppabhavā,\ntesaṃ hetuṃ Tathāgato āha;\nTesañ ca yo nirodho—\nWhatever phenomena arise from a cause,\nThese causes have been taught by the Tathāgatha;\nThese, and also their cessation—\nThus taught the great Sage.***\nThrough the lens of such insight, we can see causes and conditions as they develop together over time and lead to effects, including the entirety of our current experience.\nThe teaching on insight into conditional causation answers the big questions of “Why?” Where did such obsessive, compulsive, destructive behavior come from? Have human beings always been like this? And if not, what happened to us? It also has the potential to show us clearly what we can change and do differently that will lead to a different relationship, a different experience, and different effects. This is Wise Action, leading to a different experiential reality, not only in our mind, but also in our environment, in our relationships, and in our physical world.\nThe relationship between gender theologies and environmental destruction\nIn the past several hundred years, powerful new technologies have combined with underlying philosophies and religious teachings in unprecedented ways, allowing for the enormous and rapid expansion of cultures that were motivated by, and have perpetuated, these underlying ideas of self, relationship, and world.\nSome of these religious teachings included the idea of a humanity, “cast out from the garden,” essentially sinful and broken. We were separated from the garden, and ideas of redemption were separated from our human actions and behavior, such that whatever we did we could still be saved, and that salvation was going to come from outside, from someone and somewhere else, from the heavens above, from supernatural grace.\nThese ideas included a mandate translated and interpreted as a masculine divine right to subjugate the Earth in a justified quest and imperative for dominion over the planet and her creatures. The Earth, long known as Mother and the Mother Goddess was related to woman and all of what was to be subjugated, while man was related to the sky god Father. Salvation meant to leave this Earthly base, characterized as corrupt, depraved, base—the sky god thus toppling and gaining ascendancy over, dominating, and destroying the Earth Goddess. In some ideologies, the Earth even needed to be practically razed for the ascendency of man to the state of divine, ultimate salvation.\nHow powerful are these underlying stories and ideas of selfhood and destiny! Of course, there are myriad variations to these myths, but also common threads. When seen clearly in context, they can illuminate knowledge and understanding of just how such violent, toxic gender theologies—continually feeding back into ideas of selfhood with a mandate or “manifest destiny” to spread and dominate, combined with powerful technological developments—have led to enormous environmental destruction.\nSuch understanding is powerful. It begins to awaken us from our stupor to the recognition of the harm that such ideas and behaviors do to us, to the Earth, to the ground of our life; to the waters, air, and skies of this biosphere upon which all of our lives have arisen and depend.\nLove and care for ourselves and each other, and compassion coupled with the precepts of non-harm (ahiṃsa), lead us to a new awareness of our actions, a wish to turn around and do better. Such a healthy awakening of awareness and determination in the Pāli canon are well named as “grounds of the path” and “guardians of the world.”\nAt their root, Buddhist karmic teachings are empowering and liberating. Recognizing conditional causation, they highlight the effective and transformational importance of our actions. There is a clear understanding that conscious and intentional actions as related to both self and others, as well as to the world at large, have effects; and that we are experiencing those effects and will experience those effects, whether for good or for ill.\nCalling out the karma of waste\nIn light of the environmental impact of our individual and societal-level actions, I find it helpful to look carefully at the karma of waste. What does it mean, from a karmic perspective, to engage with our planet, with all its species and peoples, as short-term consumers creating enormous waste, largely unconcerned or oblivious to its effects? In light of karma and the teachings on conditional causation, what does it mean to become aware that we are taking myriad pristine resources and forms of life and turning them into garbage? What is the karma of this? And what is the reverse?\nFor the reverse, the turning back of negative and destructive cycles, is the manifest intention of the Buddhist teachings on conditional causation that lie at the heart of the ennobling teachings of the Four Noble Truths.\nTurning it around: “as clean as or cleaner”\nTo find the Buddha’s teachings related specifically to the topic of human waste, we can go to the first collection of the canonical three-fold Tipitaka, the Vinaya. The Buddha, when teaching, commonly conjoined the words Dhamma and Vinaya; in this case meaning the complete teaching and path of practice. In the Vinaya teachings we find monastic discipline, and in the monastic discipline we find very earthy and practical teachings on human waste. Not to throw our waste onto the green, not to pollute the soil, not to pollute the waters so that beings living in stream or downstream come to harm or feel offended.\nAnd then there is the teaching I’d like to focus on here. A teaching in which I find a clear vision of what we should be aiming for, in our hearts and minds. A most proper Buddhist environmental paradigm for our times: the Vinaya teaching on toileting.\nIn this teaching, the Buddhist monk of example goes to the toilet. (Did you know that long ago, Buddhists were international groundbreakers in the spread of hygienic toileting practices?) The monk of the story uses the toilet and then departs. The one who enters the toilet afterwards is offended by the state in which the toilet was left. Surely all of us can relate to this! Of course, that leaves a very bad impression. How could a mindful disciple of the Buddha behave so? So, the Vinaya teaching arises with regard to applied mindfulness in engaging with our human waste processes. How are disciples of the Buddha asked to leave the toilet?\nAs clean as or cleaner than when they arrived.\nThis teaching is then extended by the Vinaya-dhammā teachers to not only in-monastery toilets, but also those outside. And also to the use of other monastic dwellings and facilities. And, furthermore, to other dwellings and facilities used by disciples of the Buddha outside the monasteries. We can see here, in the Buddha’s signature style, the flushing out of a principle. Through this example, when brought to light with awakened wisdom shining on it, the much larger, salient principle, pattern, and way of being the Buddha is guiding his disciples toward is illuminated.\nWe have learned that for dedicated practitioners who would put the wisdom of the Buddha into practice at the level of the mind and heart, we should strive to end each day with our minds and hearts as clean as or cleaner than when we began the day. Not to mentally live our lives in the karmic pattern of the accumulation of unhealthy, unwholesome mental and emotional karmic waste, but to consciously turn back and reverse that process. So that each day we at least do not add anew, and that we further clean up the old remainder as much as we are able. Here we see this same basic pattern applied consciously and intentionally at the bodily, physical, worldly level, for our own health and welfare, and also that of others.\nExtending this teaching to the level of our minds and hearts, and also to the way we as individuals in society are physically living on our planet (to the Dharma as Buddhist culture), what does the intention of “as clean as or cleaner” look like in a human day? In a year, or a decade? How much can we turn around our negative and unwise habits at the personal, social, and global level toward what will be for our long-term benefit and happiness. Such action would be a truly great gift to ourselves, to each other, to humanity, and to all living beings.\nWhen we recite the popular mettā chants:\nSabbe sattā, sukhitā hontu . . . sukha jivino . . . sukhi attānaṃ pārihārāntu: “May all living beings be happy . . . live happily . . . and look after themselves happily,” we should not keep these blessed and bright wishes at the mental and verbal levels alone. Our beautiful thoughts and words should be followed by our beautiful, bright, and wise behaviors into the realm where moral virtue and ethics connect with our meditation through right and wise action: Sammā Kammanto, Sammā Ajivo, Sammā Vāyāmo, Sammā Sāti: “Right and Wise Action, Right and Wise Livelihood, with Right and Wise Effort, and Right and Wise Mindfulness.” ****\nThen we truly walk the Buddha’s Way. We too awaken after the Awakened One, setting the Dhamma wheel into motion in body, speech, heart, and mind, together in our world. There is no better Buddha vāndana, no more sublime Bodhi puja.\nImāya Dhammānudhamma pātipātiya Buddhaṃ pujemi: “By this practice in accordance with the Dhamma, I honor the Buddha.” Idam no puññaṃ Nibbāna pāccayo hotu: “May this merit and virtue of ours be condition for the realization on Nibbāna.”\nWith thanks and gratitude to Buddhistdoor Global for featuring articles on this most important and timely topic, and to Li-ming Lee and friends of Singapore for their kind support of the time and space to write this article.\nAbout the Author: Ven.

94	Which condition has clearer diagnostic tests - fibromyalgia or bronchitis?	Bronchitis has clearer diagnostic indicators than fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia requires a complex scoring system and ruling out other conditions since there's no specific test or scan that can diagnose it. It uses a widespread pain index (WPI) and symptom severity (SS) scale for diagnosis. In contrast, bronchitis can be identified through its distinct respiratory symptoms like coughing with mucus, wheezing, and inflammation of the bronchial tubes, though the specific type (acute vs chronic) is determined by the duration of symptoms.	"['You could call fibromyalgia a copycat condition. Its main symptoms -- widespread pain and fatigue -- are a lot like those of other health problems. And there’s no test or scan that can diagnose fibromyalgia, so it can be hard for your doctor to nail down what’s causing your aches and pains.\nIf you think you could have it, pack your patience. You may need to see several doctors to get the right diagnosis. Once you do, the right treatments can help you feel better.\nYour family doctor may be able to tell you have fibromyalgia if he’s familiar with the condition. But you’ll probably want to see a rheumatologist, a doctor who’s an expert in problems with joints, muscles, and bones.\nYour rheumatologist will ask you about your health and family history -- you’re more likely to have fibromyalgia if other people in your family have it.\nShe’ll give you a physical exam and may check for tender points. People who have fibromyalgia often feel tenderness when pressure is put on certain spots, generally around the back of your head, your neck, shoulders, elbows, knees, and hips.\nShe’ll also ask about your symptoms, so it’s a good idea to keep a detailed record of where and when you hurt. Is the pain dull or sharp? Does it come and go, or is it constant? Are you tired a lot or not thinking clearly? Write down any other problems you have, even if you don’t think they’re related.\nFibromyalgia or Something Else?\nSeveral conditions cause pain, muscle aches, and fatigue, just like fibromyalgia:\n- Hypothyroidism: Your thyroid gland doesn’t make enough of a certain hormone.\n- Rheumatoid arthritis or lupus: Problems with your immune system cause swelling and pain.\n- Osteoarthritis: This is the “wear and tear” type of arthritis.\n- Ankylosing spondylitis: This is a specific type of arthritis that causes pain and inflammation in your spine.\n- Polymyalgia rheumatica: This disorder causes widespread pain and stiffness that come on quickly.\nYour doctor will want to rule out any of these other problems. She may take a sample of your blood to check your hormone levels or look for signs of inflammation. You may also get X-rays so she can look at your bones.\nFibromyalgia Scoring System\nIf your doctor can’t find another reason for your symptoms, she’ll use a two-part process to help figure out if you have fibromyalgia. One part involves the trademark widespread pain on both sides of your body and above and below your waist. The other part measures how bad your symptoms are.\nShe’ll ask if you’ve had pain in 19 specific places in the past week, including your arms, legs, back, jaw, and neck. This is called the widespread pain index (WPI), and scores range from 0 to 19.\nThe symptom severity (SS) scale measures three key symptoms during the past week:\n- Waking up still tired\n- Thinking problems\nThe SS scale ranges from 0 to 3:\n- 0 -- No problems\n- 1 -- Mild: It comes and goes.\n- 2 -- Moderate: You usually have or feel it.\n- 3 -- Severe: It seriously affects your daily life.\nYour doctor also will ask if you’ve had about 40 other symptoms that can affect people who have fibromyalgia. These include depression and anxiety, bellyaches, itching, taste changes, numbness, and dizziness. This score ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (a lot of problems).\nYour doctor will add all the SS numbers together to get a score. It will be between 0 and 12.\nYour doctor may tell you that you fibromyalgia if you:\n- Have a WPI score of 7 or more and SS score of 5 or more\n- Have WPI of 3 to 6 and an SS score of 9 or more\n- Have had symptoms at the same level for at least 3 months\n- Don’t have any other condition that can cause these symptoms\nFrom there, you’ll talk about a plan to manage it. With the right treatment, most people who have it live a normal, active life.', 'Symptoms And Causes Of Bronchitis: What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Bronchitis?\nAfter you already have the flu or a cold acute bronchitis due to an illness generally develops. The main symptom of acute bronchitis is a constant cough, that might last 10 to 20 days. Other symptoms of acute bronchitis include wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe), low fever, and chest tightness or pain. If your acute bronchitis is serious, in addition you may have shortness of breath, particularly with physical action. The signs or symptoms of chronic bronchitis include coughing, wheezing, and chest discomfort.\nChronic Bronchitis Symptoms, Treatment and Contagious\nBronchitis is considered chronic when a cough with mucus continues for at least two years in a row, and at least three months, for most days of the month. Bronchitis occurs when the trachea (windpipe) and the big and small bronchi (airways) within the lungs become inflamed due to disease or annoyance from other causes. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are types of a condition defined by progressive lung disorder termed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nBronchitis and asthma are two inflammatory airway illnesses. The illness is called asthmatic bronchitis when and acute bronchitis happen together. Common asthmatic bronchitis triggers include: The symptoms of asthmatic bronchitis are a blend of the symptoms of asthma and bronchitis. You may experience some or all the following symptoms: You might wonder, is asthmatic bronchitis contagious? Yet, persistent asthmatic bronchitis commonly is just not contagious.\nBronchitis is a Familiar Infection Causing Irritation and Inflammation\nIf you suffer from chronic bronchitis, you might be vulnerable to developing more serious lung disorders as well as heart problems and infections, so you should be tracked by a physician. Acute bronchitis is generally due to lung infections, 90% of which are viral in origin. Repeated attacks of acute bronchitis, which weaken and irritate bronchial airways can lead to chronic bronchitis.\nBoth adults and children can get acute bronchitis. Most healthy individuals who get acute bronchitis get better without any issues. After having an upper respiratory tract illness like the flu or a cold frequently someone gets acute bronchitis a day or two. Breathing in things that irritate the bronchial tubes, including smoke can also causes acute bronchitis. The most common symptom of acute bronchitis is a cough that generally is not wet and hacking at first.\nBronchitis (Acute) Symptoms, Treatment, Causes\nWhat\'s, and what are the causes of acute bronchitis? Acute bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchial tubes, and acute bronchitis is suggested by a cough lasting 5 or more days as a cause. Chronic bronchitis may be developed by people who have persistent acute bronchitis. The most common causes of acute bronchitis are viruses. Bacterial causes of the disorder contain: Other irritants (for instance, tobacco smoking, chemicals, etc.) may irritate the bronchi and cause acute bronchitis.\nCoughing Up Green Mucus Contrary to what many think, mucus secretion is important for the body. This sticky secretion lubricates our respiratory organs and protects their membranes against infectious bacteria, fungi, and other environmental pollutants. An average human...\nYou can Find Two Types of Bronchitis: Acute (Short-Term) and Chronic (Long-Term)\nWhile smokers and people over 45 years of age are most likely to develop chronic bronchitis, babies, young kids, and the elderly have a heightened risk of developing acute bronchitis. Smoking is the most common cause of chronic bronchitis and may also result in acute bronchitis. Treatment for chronic bronchitis includes bronchodilators, anti-inflammatory drugs, and chest physical therapy for loosening mucus in the lungs. Seek prompt medical care if you\'re being treated for moderate although bronchitis symptoms recur or are persistent.\nBronchitis Symptoms, Treatments & Causes Merck Manuals\nInfectious bronchitis typically begins with the symptoms of a common cold: runny nose, sore throat, fatigue, and chilliness. When bronchitis is intense, fever may be slightly higher at 101 to 102 F (38 to 39 C) and may last for 3 to 5 days, but higher fevers are unusual unless bronchitis is brought on by influenza. Airway hyperreactivity, which is a short term narrowing of the airways with restriction or damage of the quantity of air flowing into and out of the lungs, is common in acute bronchitis. The damage of airflow may be activated by common exposures, such as inhaling light irritants (for instance, cologne, strong scents, or exhaust fumes) or cold atmosphere. Older individuals may have unusual bronchits symptoms, like confusion or accelerated respiration, rather than temperature and cough.\nThe study - led by Cardiff University in the UK - shows for the very first time the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) plays a key part in causing the airway disorder. Daniela Riccardi, principal investigator and a professor in Cardiff\'s School of Biosciences, describes their findings as ""unbelievably exciting,"" because for the first time they\'ve linked airway inflammation - that may be activated for example by cigarette smoke and car fumes - with airway twitchiness. She adds: ""Our paper shows how these triggers release substances that activate CaSR in airway tissue and drive asthma symptoms like airway twitchiness, inflammation, and narrowing.\nWhat Does Chronic Bronchitis Sound Like RECORDING (Wheezing symptoms emphysema Need Help Acute Cough\nAudio Recording of how chronic Bronchitis cough sounds like while laying down. The difference between bronchitis & pneumonia is that bronchitis causes an ...\nProf. Riccardi reasons: The researchers believe their findings about the purpose of CaSR in airway tissue could have significant consequences for other respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis. The researchers, from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, consider their findings will lead to treatments for a variety of diseases including asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis and even certain cancers.']"	['<urn:uuid:b9ad7508-af39-4f6d-99ab-b3556cdd0fdc>', '<urn:uuid:70ac49db-3c3e-4094-a20d-edd719169897>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	10	79	1627

96	difference monthly payment copay insurance costs	There are important differences between monthly payments (premiums) and copays in health insurance. Premiums are fixed amounts paid monthly to maintain coverage, regardless of whether you use services. They vary based on factors like plan type, coverage level, age, and location. Copays, on the other hand, are set fees you pay at the time of receiving specific medical services, like doctor visits. Copays are standardized by your plan - for example, you might pay the same $30 each time you see a physician or $50 for specialists. Copays are required regardless of whether you've met your deductible.	"[""Understanding deductibles is an important part of choosing the right insurance plan. When selecting health insurance, it’s important to understand how a deductible works and how it can affect your total cost over time. The average individual deductible in 2023 is around $2500-$3000, so having a good grasp on this concept is essential for making informed decisions when shopping for coverage. In this article, we’ll discuss why understanding deductibles is important and how you can make the most of them when looking for health insurance.\nWhat Is A Deductible & How Does It Work?\nA deductible is a set amount of money that you must pay for medical-related services and treatments before your health insurance plan kicks in. After the deductible has been met, usually your insurance coverage will help to cover the majority of your healthcare costs. Deductibles can vary quite a bit between different types of health insurance plans, so it’s important to read up on how much you need to pay out-of-pocket before benefits kick in when choosing a plan.\nCommon deductible payment options include monthly payments, quarterly payments, and annual payments. Depending on your insurance plan, you may also have the option to pay a one-time lump sum or set up automatic payments with a credit or debit card. It’s important to make sure you understand exactly how and when your deductible needs to be paid in order to make the most of your coverage.\nAn example of how a health insurance deductible might work in practice is if your policy has a $2,000 deductible and you go to the doctor for a checkup, you may still have to pay the full cost of the visit out-of-pocket until you reach the deductible amount. Once you reach the $2,000, then your health insurance will cover any additional costs.\nHere are some key facts about insurance deductibles:\n- Deductibles usually reset at the start of every calendar year.\n- Your out-of-pocket costs (such as copayments and coinsurance) count towards meeting your deductible.\n- Once you meet your deductible, your insurance plan will generally cover a larger portion of your medical expenses.\n- Different plans have different deductible requirements, so it's important to read your policy carefully to understand what you will need to pay before coverage kicks in.\nPremium vs Deductible: Differences & Correlation\nPremiums and deductibles are both important factors to consider when looking at different health insurance plans. The premium is the amount of money you pay each month for coverage, regardless of whether or not you use it. A deductible, on the other hand, is the amount that you must pay out-of-pocket before your insurance coverage kicks in—you effectively have to spend this much in order to get any benefit from your plan. In general, plans with higher premiums will have lower deductibles and vice versa, so it’s important to compare all elements when deciding which plan is best for you.\nA fixed amount that must be paid to maintain coverage. Varies based on factors such as type of health plan, level of coverage, age, and location, and is paid monthly.\nThe amount of money you need to pay before your insurance kicks in, and varies depending on the plan selected and how much money will be spent out-of-pocket before your insurance covers the remaining costs. Only applies when services are rendered.\nHow Much Will I Have To Pay After Reaching My Deductible?\nAfter you have reached your deductible, you may need to pay a copay, coinsurance or both for services and treatments. Copays are a set fee that you will be required to pay for medical treatments and services, while coinsurance is a percentage of costs that you may need to cover depending on your health insurance plan. You should read up on the specifics of your plan in order to determine how much you will have to pay out-of-pocket after reaching your deductible. Some plans also have an out-of-pocket maximum which caps the amount of money you’ll have to pay before your policy coverage kicks in.\nFor example, if your deductible is $2,000 and you have a copayment of $20 for doctor’s visits and a coinsurance of 20%, you will need to pay the first $2,000 of your medical expenses before the insurance company begins covering the costs. After that, you will have to pay the $20 copay each time you visit the doctor, as well as 20% of any other medical expenses until you reach your out-of-pocket maximum. Once that amount is reached, all covered services are usually paid in full by the insurance company.\nStill confused? Let’s dive into different terms that will help you understand all the costs:\n- An insurance premium is the amount of money that you pay for your health insurance each month. It is typically dependent on factors such as the type of coverage, your age and where you live. It may also vary between plans in the same area. The premium includes both the cost of insurance services and administrative costs associated with managing an insurance policy. It does not include any out-of-pocket expenses that you may incur, such as copays or coinsurance.\n- An insurance deductible is the amount of money you are required to pay towards your health care expenses before your insurance company will start covering the remaining costs. Generally, deductibles must be met annually, although some plans may offer a separate deductible amount for each individual covered by the plan. Deductibles can vary widely and are typically based on factors such as type of coverage, age and location.\n- A copay is a set fee that you pay for specific types of health care services at the time of your visit. Copay amounts are typically listed in your insurance plan's Summary of Benefits and Coverage and can vary depending on factors such as the type of service (e.g., doctors visits, lab tests) and whether or not you have met any applicable deductibles. Copays do not count towards meeting a deductible amount and are usually required to be paid regardless of any remaining balance.\n- Coinsurance is a type of cost sharing that requires you to pay a certain percentage of your health care costs after meeting your deductible. Coinsurance is typically listed in your insurance policy and can vary depending on the type of service and/or covered item. For example, coinsurance might require you to pay 20% of the total cost of a medical procedure, while the insurance company pays the remaining 80%.\n- The out-of-pocket maximum is the most you pay for covered services in a plan year. Once you reach this amount, your health insurance company will cover 100% of the allowed amount for covered services. Your out-of-pocket maximum includes deductibles, copays, coinsurance, and other cost-sharing amounts but not premiums. This limit helps to protect you from high medical costs in a plan year.\nDifferent Types of Deductibles\nInsurance deductibles are the amount of money you pay out-of-pocket before your insurance company begins to cover your medical expenses. There are two types of deductible:individual and family. An individual deductible applies when one person has a health plan, while a family deductible applies when more than one person is covered under a single plan. Additionally, deductibles can be either high or low depending on the type of coverage you have and your healthcare provider. High deductibles will require you to pay more up front for services before insurance coverage kicks in, while low deductibles provide more immediate coverage at a higher cost.\nIndividual vs Family Deductible\nAn individual deductible is an amount of money that must be paid out-of-pocket by a person with a health insurance plan before their insurance coverage begins. This applies when only one person has an individual health plan, not when multiple people are covered under a family plan. The individual deductible amount may vary depending on the type of coverage and medical provider selected. Once the deductible is met, the insurance company will cover expenses up to its allowed amount.\nA family deductible is an amount of money that must be paid out-of-pocket by a group of people with a health insurance plan before their insurance coverage begins. This applies when multiple people are covered under a single policy, such as a family plan. The family deductible amount may vary depending on the type of coverage and medical provider selected. Once the deductible is met, the insurance company will cover expenses up to its allowed amount.\nThere are two types of deductibles for family plans: embedded and aggregate deductibles. An embedded deductible applies when each person in the family is responsible for paying their individual share of the deductible before coverage kicks in, while an aggregate deductible applies when all members of the family are responsible for collectively meeting the total deductible before any coverage begins.\nHigh Deductible vs Low Deductible\nHigh deductibles are typically higher than low deductibles and result in lower monthly premiums for the policyholder. A high deductible insurance plan may require the policyholder to pay $2,000 or more up-front out-of-pocket for medical expenses annually before the coverage kicks in, while a low deductible plan may have an annual minimum of just $500. The amount of the deductible can significantly affect the total cost of a healthcare policy over time, so it’s important to consider what works best for your budget and healthcare needs.\nFor example, if you anticipate only minor medical issues throughout the year, a low deductible plan may be much easier to manage financially. On the other hand, if you plan on having major surgeries or other costly treatments, it may be better to opt for a high deductible plan that offers lower monthly payments but will cover a higher percentage of your costs when you actually need them.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow to Calculate Deductible For Health Insurance?\nCalculating your deductible for health insurance is a process that involves understanding the details of your policy and the costs associated with medical treatments covered by the plan. Start by gathering information on the type and amount of coverage you have, including any copays or coinsurance amounts that may apply. Once you know what is covered, figure out what expenses are not included in your plan, such as prescription drugs or chiropractic care. Then add up all of these costs to determine what your deductible will be. From there, you can adjust your plan or shop around for different coverage as needed to find a deductible that fits within your budget.\nWhat happens if you don’t meet your deductible?\nIf you don’t meet your deductible, then you will not be eligible for any of the benefits covered by your insurance policy. Depending on the specifics of your plan, this could mean that you’ll have to pay out-of-pocket for all medical treatments and prescriptions until you reach your deductible. Your insurance company may also charge higher premiums in order to make up for the cost of offering coverage without a deductible. Make sure to understand exactly what will happen in the event that you don’t meet your deductible before signing up for a policy.\nCan Deductible Be Waived?\nDepending on your insurance policy, it may be possible to waive your deductible. Some policies may offer a waiver if you are able to pay your premium in full at the beginning of the policy period or if you meet certain income requirements. Other plans may offer a waiver if you purchase additional coverage such as vision or dental insurance. It’s important to read through the details of your policy before signing up and make sure that you understand any conditions or restrictions that could apply to a deductible waiver.\nCan I Get Insurance to Cover My Deductible?\nYes, you can purchase insurance to cover your deductible. Some companies offer plans that provide coverage up to a certain amount, or you may be able to buy an additional policy through the same company that offers coverage beyond your plan’s limit. It’s important to read through the details before signing up and make sure you understand any conditions or restrictions that could apply before making a commitment.\nWhy Should You Never Make A Claim That Is Lower Than Your Deductible?\nMaking a claim that is lower than your deductible can be very costly in the long run, as it could lead to an increase in your premium rates. This is because insurance companies assume that if you make a claim for an amount less than your deductible, then you are more likely to make other claims that exceed your deductible. Therefore, by making these smaller claims you may be unable to get discounts or benefits based on being a low-risk customer. Additionally, making multiple small claims can have a negative impact on your overall credit score.\nWhat Is The Key Purpose of Having A Deductible?\nThe key purpose of having a deductible is to lower the overall cost of your insurance. A deductible is an amount you must pay out-of-pocket before your insurance company will cover any additional costs. By increasing your deductible, you can reduce your monthly premiums by decreasing the amount of coverage you receive. However, it is important to remember that if an accident occurs, it will be up to you to pay for the first part of any damages or medical costs that occur before your insurance kicks in.\nIn summary, a deductible is an amount of money you must pay out-of-pocket before your insurance company will cover any additional costs. It is important to carefully consider the amount of your deductible so that you can find an affordable plan that meets your needs.

Deductibles are usually set at rounded amounts (such as $500 or $1,000). Typically, the lower the premium, the higher the deductible.\nCoinsurance: The amount of money you owe to a medical provider once the deductible has been paid. Coinsurance is usually a predetermined percentage of the total bill. If the policy’s co-insurance is set at 15% and the bill comes to $100, the policy-holder owes $15 in co-insurance.\nCo-pay: This type of insurance plan is similar to co-insurance, but with one key exception: rather than waiting until the deductible has been paid out, you must make their copayment at the time of service. Most often, copayments are standardized by your plan, meaning you’ll pay the same $30 each time you see a physician, or the same $50 each time you see a specialist.\nOut-of-pocket maximum: The amount of money you pay for deductibles and coinsurance charges within a given year before the insurance company starts paying for all covered expenses.\nIn-network: This term refers to physicians and medical establishments that deliver patient services covered under the insurance plan. In-network providers are generally the cheapest option for policyholders. Insurance companies typically have negotiated lower rates with in-network providers.\nOut-of-network: This term refers to physicians and medical establishments not covered under your insurance plan. Services from out-of-network providers are usually more expensive than those rendered by in-network providers. This is because out-of-network providers have not negotiated lower rates with your insurer.\nPre-existing condition: Any chronic disease, disability, or other condition you have at the time of application. In some cases, symptoms or ongoing treatments related to pre-existing conditions cause premiums to be higher than usual.\nWaiting period: Many employer-sponsored insurance plans mandate a period of 90 days before employees can enroll in their insurance plans.\nEnrollment period / open enrollment: The window of time during which you can apply for health insurance or modify a plan to include your spouse and/or children. Policy-holders are unable to adjust their plan until the next open enrollment unless they experience a qualifying life event. These include a marriage, divorce, birth of a child, changes to individual/household income, or interstate residence relocation.\nDual coverage: The act of maintaining a health plan with more than one insurer. For example, many married people receive coverage from both their employers and their spouse’s employer. Others may opt to receive individual coverage from more than one insurer.\nCoordination of benefits: This process is applied by individuals who have two or more existing policies to ensure that their beneficiaries do not receive more than the combined maximum payout for the plans.\nContinuation of coverage: This is essentially an extension of insurance coverage offered to individuals no longer covered under a particular plan; it most often applies to former employees and retirees of companies that offer employee coverage. COBRA benefits qualify as continuation coverage.\nReferral: An official notice from a qualified physician to an insurer that recommends specialist treatment for a current policy-holder.']"	['<urn:uuid:1bad33b1-7b37-45bf-9996-db8a7b524128>', '<urn:uuid:54091892-349d-4854-b17b-5f314d55c557>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	6	97	2866
97	How has satellite imaging evolved to capture human activity at night, and what role does family interaction play in managing screen-related stress?	NASA's satellite imaging has advanced to potentially provide daily updates of nighttime imagery, improving upon the previous decade-long intervals, with new methods to account for moonlight and atmospheric conditions. Regarding screen use and stress management, psychologists and experts indicate that family time can reduce depression and anxiety, but this benefit is compromised when families spend their time together on devices instead of engaging in real communication.	"['The images compare the composite night-time view of India in 2016 with that of 2012\nthanks: Business standard\ndedicated by: Kavignar Thanigai.\nNASA on Thursday released new global nighttime images of the Earth – including a detailed view of India and its surroundings that show how patterns of human settlement changed across the country between 2012 and 2016.\nThe new images compare the composite night-time view of India and its surrounding areas in 2016 with that of 2012.\nThe two images show how cities have grown and patterns of human settlements have changed across the country during those years, NASA said.\nSatellite images of Earth at night – often referred to as “night lights” – have been a source of curiosity for public and a tool for fundamental research for nearly 25 years.\nThey provide a broad, beautiful view, showing how humans have shaped the planet.\nProduced every decade or so, such maps have spawned hundreds of pop-culture uses and dozens of economic, social science and environmental research projects.\nA research team led by Earth scientist Miguel Roman of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Centre in the US plans to find out if night lights imagery could be updated yearly, monthly or even daily.\nIn the years since the 2011 launch of the NASA-NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite, researchers have been analysing night lights data and developing new software and algorithms to make night lights imagery clearer, more accurate and readily available.\nThey are now on the verge of providing daily, high- definition views of Earth at night, and are targeting the release of such data to the science community later this year\nSince researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA released a new Earth at night map in 2012, Roman and teammates at NASA’s Earth Observing Satellite Data and Information System (EOSDIS) have been working to integrate nighttime data into NASA’s Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) and Worldview mapping tools.\nThe new global composite map of night lights was observed in 2016. The NASA group has examined the different ways that light is radiated, scattered and reflected by land, atmospheric and ocean surfaces.\nThe principal challenge in nighttime satellite imaging is accounting for the phases of the Moon, which constantly varies the amount of light shining on Earth, though in predictable ways.\nLikewise, seasonal vegetation, clouds, aerosols, snow and ice cover, and even faint atmospheric emissions (such as airglow and auroras) change the way light is observed in different parts of the world.\nThe new maps were produced with data from all months of each year. The team wrote code that picked the clearest night views each month, ultimately combining moonlight-free and moonlight-corrected data.\nSuomi NPP observes nearly every location on Earth at roughly 1:30 pm and 1:30 am (local time) each day, observing the planet in vertical 3,000-kilometre strips from pole to pole. Suomi NPP data is freely available to scientists within minutes to hours of acquisition.\nArmed with more accurate nighttime environmental products, the NASA team is now automating the processing so that users will be able to view nighttime imagery within hours of acquisition.\nThis has the potential to aid short-term weather forecasting and disaster response.', ""Hansa Bhargava MD FAAP\nStaff Physician, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta\nMedical Editor, WebMD\nPediatricians are seeing more and more teens suffering from stress. Whether they are complaining of it or having somatic symptoms such as headaches and stomach aches, it seems that stress and anxiety are on the rise. We know that over scheduling, homework, and the pressures of getting into college can contribute to this. But can media also affect it? Is screen time and media a stressor or a remedy for stress?\nIn a recent WebMD survey published in their Teens and Stress report, 54% of teens were stressed according to parents. Interestingly, 40% of parents turned to the screen for family stress relief while 58% of teens did. Social media and texting was used as stress relief by almost half the teens. This is on the heels of the Common Sense Media survey reporting that US teens were using media for 9 hours a day. Other recent reports have shown that 94% of teens with mobile devices are online daily with many online constantly.\nSo it seems that stress is on the rise and media use is on the rise. Although there may not be a direct relationship, some real issues impact stress and anxiety. Consider this: 23 % of teens report cyberbullying, especially girls. There have been reports of “Facebook depression” and loneliness, as kids who aren’t in social media conversations may feel left out. Other negative consequences can also have an impact: many teens are in front of a screen late at night or ‘sleep text’, both of which can contribute to lack of sleep, which in turn can decrease focus and potentially cause irritability and depression. And last but certainly not least, what about the time media consumes?\nTime spent on media is time often not spent communicating with family. Lately, when I’ve gone into a restaurant, I’ve observed that as soon as a family sits down, everyone pulls out a mobile device. No one is really talking. So even the short amount of time not doing homework, playing soccer, or at school is being compromised. Psychologists, community leaders and experts have long reported that family time can contribute to less depression, less anxiety, better academic performance and generally happier kids. But what if that family time is on media??\nAs the AAP reviews our screen time recommendations, I feel that we, as pediatricians should continue to advise parents about basic principles.\nParents need to lay down some parameters about when and how media is used. Media is a centerpiece of teens’ lives and is not going away, but just as we don’t give our kids a set of keys to our car and say “just drive”, we need to enforce appropriate media use. And good modeling is also critical: parents need to put down their mobile devices and simply communicate with their kids. Old fashioned parenting and just talking to your kids can build the foundation to a less stressful childhood and hopefully a happier life.""]"	['<urn:uuid:106d3a03-4696-4535-856c-4f33a527bf65>', '<urn:uuid:9ee5a44c-ac0e-4471-bc2a-f3b31e423c46>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	22	66	1037
98	What's the bug size and how fast does it destroy trees?	The emerald ash borer is small, about the size of Abraham Lincoln's head on a penny. Tree mortality rises within a few years of an infestation, though symptoms are often not seen until a couple of years after initial infestation.	"[""An invasive beetle is expected to move west in Iowa, prompting one city to look into how to deal with it.\nSioux City council members on Monday heard a presentation from the city parks and recreation department about the invasive emerald ash borer – an insect known for killing millions of ash trees across the country. Sioux City Parks Maintenance Field Supervisor Kelly Bach said tree mortality rises within a few years of an infestation.\n“That’s if you do absolutely nothing at that point and just leave it be,” Bach said.\nThe city is looking at several ways to manage the emerald ash borer: It could simply remove trees once they die, remove all ash trees before the insect arrives and replace them with another species, treat the trees with chemicals that will kill the insect, or combine all three approaches together. Ash trees make up more than a quarter of Sioux City’s trees.\nBach’s staff is recommending the city implement the combined approach. Treatment would have to be done every two to three years, he said.\nThe destructive beetle’s larvae snack on tissue under tree bark, cutting off nutrients and water from moving through, ultimately killing trees. The insect has so far been spotted in two-thirds of Iowa’s 99 counties, mostly in the east and south. Other than Buena Vista County, 19 counties in northwest Iowa are likely untouched.\nA map from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Iowa Department of Ag., Iowa DNR and Iowa State University also shows where the emerald ash borer has been detected and the recommended treatment areas, which includes a 15 mile buffer of where to treat.\nState environmental officials are expecting it to creep further west over time, following where people transport firewood and even latching onto railway systems, said Emma Hanigan, the urban and community forestry coordinator for the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.\n“On railways, emerald ash borer can just attach, and, instead of flying, be carried across the state that way,” Hanigan said.\nHanigan noted U.S. Highway 34 and a nearby railroad system in southern Iowa have been hotspots for the spread.\nThe reason they’re expecting it to move west in Iowa, Hanigan said, is because that has been the pattern across the U.S. The emerald ash borer was first discovered in Michigan in 2002 and has “spread outward from there” she said.\nAccording to a map of emerald ash borer sightings from Iowa Department of Agriculture’s Entomology and Plant Science Bureau, the beetle first surfaced in Iowa in 2010. From 2010 to 2017, it primarily hit southern, central and eastern Iowa.\nIn 2018, the beetle reached Carroll, Crawford and Pottawattamie counties in western Iowa. It was confirmed in Cass County in February, the only new detection in the state this year. It has also reached Alta in Buena Vista County and was found in 2018 in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, 90 miles to the northwest of Sioux City.\n“It is within 90 miles of Sioux City, both to the east and to the northwest, so we need to have this in place so that we have a plan rather than, ‘it’s here, now what do we do?’” Bach said.\nSioux City Mayor Pro-Tem Dan Moore said the city will need to educate people about the insect. The city is planning to hire a dedicated staff member.\n“We’ve built that into our budget to add someone, to take on the issues that will be coming up that we predicted, and [Bach's] predicted, that will happen and occur in the next three years,” Moore said.\nThe symptoms of emerald ash borer are often not seen until a couple of years after an initial infestation, Hanigan said. She said communities in western Iowa should anticipate that it will come and “start planning for their ash.”\n“Without symptoms, we’re unsure of the spread. We continue to monitor,” Hanigan said. “But for western Iowa communities, it could be that they may have emerald ash borer found this year. It could be another seven years. We just don’t know how that spread will look across northwest Iowa.”"", 'Emerald Ash Borer Response Plan. Emerald Ash Borer (EAB), an invasive beetle that kills all species of ash trees, has been confirmed in Story County. With EAB confirmed in nearby communities, the future for ash trees looks uncertain. To be prepared for the arrival and to slow the spread of this destructive insect, the City of Ames is pursuing an Emerald Ash Borer Response Plan that balances public safety with a commitment to replanting trees on public land.\nThere are more than 2,300 public ash trees in City right-of-way, in maintained areas of City parks (including along paved trails), and at City-owned facilities. Ash trees represent 16 percent of all public trees in Ames, which is higher than the 10 percent recommended for optimum diversity. Map of Ash Trees on Public Property\nThe Ames City Council approved the EAB Response Plan to extend the environmental, social, and economic benefits of ash trees, and to increase the diversity of the urban forest, while being fiscally responsible to Ames citizens. The plan pursues a phased treatment and removal process for public ash trees. In the first five years, a predetermined number of ash trees would be removed based on public safety, tree defects, size, and costs. The annual removal process would spread costs over a longer time period, allow staff to reevaluate the plan regularly, and limit the visual impact on streets lined with ash trees. Some ash trees will be treated, but only to keep EAB from killing the tree before it can be removed.\nAlthough EAB will have a major detrimental impact on our community over the next several years, this challenge also presents Ames with an unexpected opportunity to bring greater diversity to the public trees in our urban forest. Through the one-to-one replacement program, a variety of saplings will be planted at a size of 1-1/2 inch, which is optimal for establishment and survival of new trees. Since most tree removals will occur during the winter, there will be a time gap between removals and the replanting of new trees. Care and Watering Guidelines for Newly-Planted Trees\nWhat is Emerald Ash Borer? EAB is native to Asia and was likely introduced into North America via cargo ships or planes. The beetle is bright metallic green in color and is visible to the naked eye, but small—about the size of Abraham Lincoln’s head on a penny. The adult beetles eat ash foliage but cause little damage to the tree. It is the larvae that cause destruction. Larvae feed on the inner bark of ash trees, preventing delivery of water and nutrients to the tree, causing it to die.\nWhat Can Property Owners Do? The EAB strategy is primarily geared toward trees on publicly-owned property; however, homeowners can also help prevent the spread of the insect on their property by observing the following suggestions:\n- Do not move firewood across county or state lines. According to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, the spread of Emerald Ash Borer into uninfected areas has been done primarily through the movement of firewood.\n- Identify ash trees on your property and watch for signs of Emerald Ash Borer. EAB, to date, has been found only on ash trees. Only those trees in the genus Fraxinus are ash trees. A common misconception, due to its name, is that a mountain ash is an ash tree. However, the mountain ash is in the genus Sorbus, and therefore is not an ash tree.\nAsh: 5 to 7 leaflets on a compoundleaf (bud at the base of the stem)NOT an Ash\nAfter identifying an ash tree, watch it for signs of decline, such as the top of the tree dying off, spindly sprouts growing from the trunk or roots, “D” shaped exit holes, and increased woodpecker activity. To confirm the presence of EAB in a tree, peel back the bark and look for the larvae, which is whitish in color with no prolegs and bell-shaped segments.\n- Contact your local extension office or professional tree service to discuss options for treating, removing or replacing your ash trees. If your ash tree is healthy, in a good location, and provides useful shade, there are chemical treatments available. However, to prevent ground contamination these chemical treatments have per-acre limits on the amount that can be used. Hiring a professional tree service is the best way to ensure the proper amount of chemical is used. Treatments that involve spraying a tree will not work, as they only kill the adult beetles and not the larvae, which cause the damage.\nAdditional Emerald Ash Borer Resources']"	['<urn:uuid:676f378b-b2c7-44b3-b76a-a4c870b90e53>', '<urn:uuid:4fa7ef4c-4eae-4063-8f4e-2833708aaaff>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T10:58:44.993934	11	40	1446
99	What unique linguistic techniques did Hopkins employ in his poetry to create new effects beyond his rhythmic innovations?	Hopkins placed familiar words into new and surprising contexts, employed compound and unusual word combinations, and used interjections, assonance and alliteration to give his poems counterpoint in musical terms. He drew musical inspiration from Irish and Welsh speech, nursery rhymes, and Old English manuscripts.	['When approaching forms, it’s always surprising to find how old some of them are. When considering modern poetry, it’s surprising also to know that poems we consider modern even revolutionary are over one hundred years old. I think the period after World War II must have curtailed the move toward “modernism”. And as I’m often reminded by one of our dVerse poets Arron Shilling, the most fertile modern movements in art, literature, philosophy, theater, music and dance was the period between the two world wars. Even though this type of poetry was conceived before that era, it has impacted and continues to impact the prosody of modern poets since its creation. The sound of it is new, different and exciting to a poet.\nGerard Manley Hopkins who is credited with the invention of Sprung Rhythm was born in 1844. He was the son of a poet and apparently could have been almost anything he wanted. One of those gifted young men, the oldest of nine children he attended grammar school in Highgate and won a scholarship to Bailliol College, Oxford. He graduated as its star. Having been tutored in drawing and painting as well as music, at university he opted for poetry. He was almost surely a manic/depressive personality with a strong Anglican faith. Seeking for “authenticity”, he converted to Roman Catholicism under the influence of Cardinal Newman who had famously converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism.\nBecoming very devout, he took Holy Orders, and became a Jesuit Priest. Early on Hopkins (having read Thomas Acquinas) decided that it was distracting, and possibly sinful to carry on with his poetry. He burned all his early poetry and didn’t write again for seven years. After reading Dun Scotus in 1872, he changed his mind and began writing again. He studied Old English and having moved to Wales learned Welsh.\nIn 1874, he wrote a poem, The Wreck of the Deutschland, about a shipwreck that had killed five German nuns who had been persecuted. This was the initial use of his new theory about poetry, Sprung Rhythm. By not limiting the number of “slack” or unaccented syllables, Hopkins allowed for more flexibility in his lines and created new acoustic possibilities. In this meter of poetry, rhythm is based on the number of stressed syllables in a verse without regard to the number of unstressed syllables.\nPut another way, sprung rhythm may be said to designate the meter of a verse which contains feet of varying number of syllables, with the first syllable accented in each case. The feet possible are the monosyllabic (a single stressed syllable), the trochee, the dactyl, and the spondee. The obvious result of a line composed of combinations of such varying feet is extreme metrical irregularity. The scansion of such poetry is, as W. B. Yeats noted, difficult because “it may not be certain at first glance where the stress falls”. The Poetic foot may continue to the beginning of the next line is noted in almost all the information concerning this technique.\nWhen considering how to write it for myself, I more or less disregarded the concept of foot altogether. I believe the way to approach sprung rhythm is to consider only the number of stressed syllables per line. Choosing a number like four or five (both of which are common to English speech patterns) and employing that many per line seems to work. For the most part, I think lines begin and end with stressed syllables; however Hopkins liked the idea of enjambment rather than end-stopped lines. In such cases if the end syllable is stressed the following syllables at the beginning of the next line may be unstressed to keep the “spring” in the text continuing.\nThe Encyclopedia Britannica defines sprung rhythm as “an irregular system of prosody developed by the 19th-century English poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. It is based on the number of stressed syllables in a line and permits an indeterminate number of unstressed syllables. In sprung rhythm, a foot may be composed of from one to four syllables. (In regular English metres, a foot consists of two or three syllables.) Because stressed syllables often occur sequentially in this patterning rather than in alternation with unstressed syllables, the rhythm is said to be “sprung.” Hopkins claimed to be only the theoretician, not the inventor, of sprung rhythm.”\nIn addition to developing new rhythmic effects, Hopkins was also very interested in ways of rejuvenating poetic language. He regularly placed familiar words into new and surprising contexts. He also often employed compound and unusual word combinations, interjections, assonance and alliteration giving his poems counterpoint in musical terms. As he was both an artist and a musician as well as a poet, his poetry has color, texture and musicality that he would likely argue was present in English from its inception. He found that music in the rhythms of Irish and Welsh speech, in nursery rhymes, and the texts of Old English manuscripts.\nI think to write using this technique is to listen to one’s own personal music. As it’s difficult to scan, there is no “right or wrong” in using this technique. It’s another tool in finding one’s personal voice using English words and rhythms as the music of poetry. I am including Pied Beauty, one of his more famous poems in a proposed scansion.\n|Glory|be to|God for|dappled|things—\nFor|skies of|couple-|colour as a|brinded|cow;\nFor|rose-moles|all in|stipple upon|trout that|swim;\n|Landscape|plotted and|pieced—fold,|fallow, and|plough;\nAnd|all|trades, their|gear and|tackle and|trim.\n|All things|counter, o|riginal,|spare,|strange;\nWhat|ever is|fickle,|freckled|(who knows|how?)\nWith|swift,|slow; sweet,|sour; a|dazzle,|dim;\nHe|fathers-|forth whose|beauty is|past|change:\nIf there is a “challenge” today, it is to take this springing of stresses and use it in a poem of your own.

['Trees are one of the most important assets that Carnfunnock Country Park has to offer as an educational resource.\nTree planting can be arranged for school or youth groups or other interested parties. Each winter we invite local schools to visit Carnfunnock and help us plant native trees in the grounds of the Park.\nWe are very proud that local schools have helped us plant a native orchard on our biodiversity trail as part of National Tree Week. Species planted included crab apple, wild cherry and blackthorn, as well as downy birch, goat willow and alder.\nWorld of Trees\nThis new educational material encourages teachers to take their Key Stage 2/3 pupils on a woodland exploration to discover the world of trees using activity based worksheets.\nTeacher guidance notes are also provided outlining general background information and additional activities. Our publication called ‘Tree Spotting at Carnfunnock Country Park’ is also complementary to this material and is available directly from the Park. The programme is available all year round - although certain activities are seasonal and can only be carried out at particular times of the year. There are 2 core elements to this educational material:\nThe worksheets and teacher guidance notes are in PDF format and can be downloaded free of charge below. Equipment needs are outlined in the guidance notes and will depend on the activity which you choose to carry out. This project was assisted by the Causeway Coast and Glens Heritage Trust as part of the Natural Resource Rural Tourism Initiative under the EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.\nCosts and booking\nThis material is free to download provided it is not reproduced for commercial purposes. Please remember to book your visit in advance.\nCurriculum area: The World Around Us (Science, Geography, Maths, Art and Design, English, History, ICT)\nEach worksheet involves experiments or activities which can be carried out in the Park to identify:\n- How old is that tree?\nLearn how to measure the age of both growing trees and felled trees. There is also the opportunity for comparisons to be made amongst the class.\n- How tall is my tree?\nChildren can establish the height of a tree using two methods of calculation, which can be compared for accuracy.\nPlease download teacher guidance notes and student worksheets below:\n- Environmental Maths - Teacher Guidance Notes (Colour version)\n- Environmental Maths - Worksheets (Colour version)\n- Environmental Maths - Teacher Guidance Notes (Mono version)\n- Environmental Maths - Worksheets (Mono version)\nThis consists of the following activity based worksheets:\n- Know the parts of a tree: What kind of tree is it?
