1	diabetic food blood sugar spikes compare orange juice versus grape vinegar effects	Orange juice and grape vinegar have opposite effects on blood sugar levels in diabetics. Orange juice can cause problematic blood sugar spikes - a 16-ounce glass of unsweetened orange juice contains 52 grams of carbohydrates, which is equivalent to an entire meal's recommended carbohydrate allowance for a diabetic. The lack of fiber and liquid form makes it easy to consume too much too quickly. In contrast, grape vinegar actually helps lower blood glucose and insulin levels. Studies have shown that consuming vinegar with meals reduces post-meal blood glucose levels, and taking it at bedtime can even help moderate morning blood sugar levels in Type 2 diabetics. Therefore, while orange juice should be avoided, grape vinegar can be beneficial for managing blood sugar in diabetes.	"[""Can People With Type 2 Diabetes Eat Oranges?\nPeople with Type 2 diabetes need to choose foods that allow them to maintain a good blood sugar control while providing the most nutrition to protect them against the complications associated with the disease. An average-size orange can provide more than three-quarters of your daily vitamin C, in addition to many other important nutrients and antioxidants. Most Type 2 diabetics can safely incorporate small servings of fresh oranges, but not orange juice, into their diet.\nThe American Diabetes Association recommends people with Type 2 diabetes get no more than 45 to 60 grams of carbohydrates per meal. The exact amount of carbohydrates you can handle will vary depending on your gender, age, physical activity level, weight goals and degree of diabetes control. Consult a registered dietitian specializing in diabetes for help determining your personal carbohydrate target. Oranges, as well as all other fruits, provide carbohydrates. You can choose to use your carbohydrate budget at each meal by eating either oranges or other fruits, pasta, rice, bread or potatoes, as long as you don't get too many carbohydrates at once, which would elevate your blood sugar levels.\nAn average orange contains about 15 grams of carbohydrates, while a large one can provide as many as double that amount. Choose smaller oranges to keep your diabetes and blood sugar levels under control. For example, you could have a small orange, which provides 15 grams of carbohydrates, along with a serving of yogurt, nuts and a small amount of granola for a total of 45 grams of carbohydrates, which would be acceptable for most people with Type 2 diabetes. You can also stay within your carbohydrate budget by eating chicken or fish with a medium sweet potato and broccoli for lunch or dinner and complete your meal with an orange.\nThe main problems with orange juice are its lack of fiber and its liquid form, which makes it easy to drink too much in a very short amount of time. For example, you can easily get 52 grams of carbohydrates in a 16-ounce glass of unsweetened orange juice, which is the equivalent of all the carbohydrates you should have in your whole meal. The carbohydrate content of orange-flavored punches and beverages is even higher. Stick to fresh oranges to prevent health-damaging spikes in your blood sugar levels and better control your Type 2 diabetes.\nMonitoring Your Blood Sugars\nSome people with Type 2 diabetes can control their condition simply by eating healthily and exercising, while others require diabetes medications or even insulin injection. Your diabetes treatment plan will influence your ability to handle carbohydrates, whether they come from sugars, grains or fruits. Ask your doctor for a prescription to obtain a blood glucose meter to check your own blood sugar levels at home. Check your blood sugar before your meal containing an orange and then two hours after. Your blood sugar levels should not go beyond 180 mg/dL. If they do, cut down on the amount of carbohydrates you eat until you manage to prevent an excessive increase in your blood sugar levels following your meal."", ""What Are the Health Benefits of Grape Vinegar?\nVinegar is made through fermentation of sugars into acetic acid by microorganisms. It can be made from any fruit or any material containing sugar. Grape vinegar is synonymous with wine vinegar and is made by further fermentation of wine. It's used as a condiment, for pickling and to prepare some sauces. It is also strongly bactericidal and is used in traditional medicine to cure infections. Grape vinegar is low in calories and consumption is associated with a number of health benefits.\nThe August 2009 issue of “Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry” reported that acetic acid -- the main component of grape vinegar -- can suppress body fat accumulation. The study, which was carried out among obese Japanese subjects, involved the participants drinking 0 milliliters, 15 milliliters, or 30 milliliters of vinegar daily for 12 weeks. Following treatment, the two groups drinking vinegar exhibited lower body weights, waist circumferences and blood triglyceride levels than the group not drinking vinegar.\nGlucose and Insulin\nCan Vinegar Hurt Your Digestive System?\nResearch reported in the September 2005 issue of the “European Journal of Clinical Nutrition” investigated whether addition of vinegar to a bread meal impacted on the postprandial glucose and insulin responses. The study found that the addition of vinegar resulted in lower blood glucose and insulin levels following consumption of the meal. The participants also reported increased satiety after the addition of vinegar. The higher the amount of vinegar used, the more pronounced these responses. These altered metabolic responses are also expected to be seen after consuming pickled products.\n- Research reported in the September 2005 issue of the “European Journal of Clinical Nutrition” investigated whether addition of vinegar to a bread meal impacted on the postprandial glucose and insulin responses.\n- The study found that the addition of vinegar resulted in lower blood glucose and insulin levels following consumption of the meal.\nType 2 Diabetes\nConsumption of vinegar is beneficial to type 2 diabetics, reported the November 2007 issue of “Diabetes Care.” The researchers found that subjects taking vinegar at bedtime had lower blood glucose levels in the morning compared to subjects taking a placebo. This was the first study to describe a hypoglycemic effect of vinegar apart from mealtime. The authors attributed this to the effects of acetic acid on glucose metabolism in the liver, and note that vinegar may be beneficial to diabetic individuals to suffer from a pre-breakfast spike in fasting glucose, an event known as the dawn phenomenon.\nMalt Vinegar Diet\nGrape vinegar, like red wine, is rich in polyphenols. These substances are powerful antioxidants that can help to protect you against damage by free radical molecules. Free radicals have been implicated in a number of chronic conditions including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and inflammatory conditions.

2	I've been hearing about supplement contamination in sports, and I'd like to understand both how anti-doping violations are handled administratively and what specific risks exist with different supplement types. Could you explain the process and risks?	For administrative handling, anti-doping violations are managed through a structured system where organizations like Sport Integrity Australia handle testing, results management, and sanctions. They work with national sporting organizations and follow procedures that include automatic investigations of support personnel in cases involving minors. Violations can result in multi-year sanctions, as evidenced by cases like Kristy-Lee Swadling's four-year ban. Regarding supplement risks, studies show different types carry varying levels of risk - capsules and tablets are highest risk with 10 out of 13 contaminated products in one European study being in these forms. This is because they're often manufactured in facilities that also produce prescription medications. Liquid products like sports drinks showed the lowest contamination risk. Cross-contamination can occur during manufacturing and distribution, and some products contain 'proprietary blends' that don't fully disclose ingredients.	['Please refer to this link:\nAPU Anti-Doping Milestones\nLoU between IPF and APU re. Responsibilities for TUEs, Testing and Result Management.\nAPU has engaged the services of PWC to conduct tests (both in-competition and out-of-competition) on behalf of the International Powerlifting Federation (IPF) who strictly adhere to all WADA regulations and guidelines.\nDear APU Members,\nAs the Australian Powerlifting Union Ltd. (APU) continues to grow in membership, number of competitions (local through to international) as well as structure (ie: introduction of state bodies), it is important to highlight the stringent anti-doping policies and procedures that are being implemented.\nAs a recent example, at the 2018 APU WA State Championship, a number of “in-competition“ tests were conducted by Professional Worldwide Controls (PWC) who are an independent ISO certified Anti Doping service provider.\nAPU has engaged the services of PWC to conduct tests (both in-competition and out-of-competition) on behalf of the International Powerlifting Federation (IPF) who strictly adhere to all WADA regulations and guidelines. APU has zero tolerance for athletes who wish to engage in doping activities to gain an unfair advantage. As such, APU remains steadfast in its rigorous approach to ensuring all members, whether they be local competitors through to elite international lifters, enjoy the sport of Powerlfiting in a fair environment.\nWe would like to thank the International Powerlifting Federation for the tremendous support they have provided in building the relationship between APU, IPF and PWC. We look forward to a continuing the agreement together for a long and effective future.\nThe APU Anti-Doping Policy has been approved by the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA). It takes effect on 25 September 2019.\nDear APU Members,\nASADA and the Australian Powerlifting Union (APU) have been working closely together to develop a relationship to ensure that the sport of powerlifting can provide the opportunities for all our athletes to compete in a sport with the best available anti-doping systems available.\nWe are extremely pleased to announce that the ASADA has approved the APU’s anti-doping policy and has thereby engaged in an agreement to work together and provide anti-doping services for all APU members within.\nWhat does this now mean for APU members?\nAPU will see ASADA at events held under the APU banner. This will provide the sport with more scope as the cost for testers in some areas will be reduced.\nAll members will be required to familiarise themselves with the new APU anti-doping policy, which are now on the APU website:\nAPU members can download the ASADA app. The app will allow you to “check a medication”, ”report doping”, “check a supplement” and “give feedback”.\nMore details can be found here: https://www.asada.gov.au/tech\nWhat does this mean for ASADA?\nASADA has a number of responsibilities including:\n- planning, coordinating, implementing, monitoring and advocating improvements in Doping Control\n- cooperating with relevant national organisations, agencies and other Anti-Doping Organisations\n- encouraging reciprocal Testing between National Anti-Doping Organisations\n- planning, implementing and monitoring anti-doping information, education and prevention programs\n- pursuing potential anti-doping rule violations within its jurisdiction, including investigating whether Athletes, Athlete Support Personnel or other Persons may have been involved in each case of doping, and ensuring proper enforcement of Consequences\n- conducting an automatic investigation of Athlete Support Personnel within its jurisdiction in the case of any anti-doping rule violation by a Minor and of any Athlete Support Personnel who has provided support to more than one Athlete found to have committed an anti-doping rule violation\n- cooperating fully with WADA in connection with investigations conducted by WADA pursuant to Article 20.7.10 of the Code\n- where funding is provided, working with the relevant body to ensure that relevant funding is withheld to an Athlete or Athlete Support Personnel while he or she is serving a period of Ineligibility for violation of anti-doping rules.\nWhat does this mean for APU?\nThe objectives of the Anti-Doping Policy is to:\n- comply with the Code, ASADA Act, ASADA Regulations (including the NAD scheme) as amended from time to time\n- promote the integrity of our sport by deterring doping in our sport.\nThe engagement of ASADA for APU is an important step forward for the APU to provide confidence amongst the members, community and potential stakeholders. The relationship between APU and ASADA will provide us with tools needed for the governance of a highly functional sporting organisation.\nASADA provide a number of educational courses online. Some of these will become necessary to complete for eligibility for selection into State and National teams. Others may be necessary for persons taking on certain roles or returning from Sanction. The Club Affiliate manager, Coaches and officials will be required to complete courses for eligibility into roles. APU will also engage ASADA to conduct presentations and workshops for APU’s State branches and club affiliates.\nWhile each APU member is ultimately responsible to comply with APU Anti-doping policy, APU will provide measures to prevent the “avoidable” violations of anti-doping policies of members by providing Education and Awareness.\nOverall, the incredible results that have been achieved by APU in such a very short time are due to the relentless efforts of many, and the confidence in us from you, the members. This is another achievement that has been developed by the hard work put in by many.\nOn behalf of the APU Board, thank you for your continued support.\nWe will continue to work towards growth and move our sport forward.\nYours in Strength\nPresident APU Ltd\nDear APU Members,\nAustralian Powerlifting Union Ltd. Anti-Doping Policy has been amended and is effective 10 August 2020.\nThe changes bring our sport in line with the establishment of Sport Integrity Australia which will replace the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) as the National Anti-Doping Organisation (NADO) in Australia from 1 July 2020.\nThe changes which come into effect on 10 August 2020 are:\n• Replacing the words Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) with Sport Integrity Australia (SIA);\n• Replacing CAS with the National Sports Tribunal (NST) as the first-instance hearing body for all athletes and the Appeals Division of the NST for appeals for ‘non-international level’ athletes.\n• Amending the definition of ‘National Level Athlete’ to introduce the Lower-Level Athlete category to allow greater flexibility in dealing with and sanctioning athletes below International or National level; and\n• Removing the Anti-Doping Rule Violation Panel.\nFor more details on the changes, please click here\nYou can stay educated about Anti-Doping by downloading the ASADA Clean Sport App, available through the Apple App Store and Google Play.\nThe App is a one stop shop for Anti-Doping which includes tools to find low risk supplements, check if a medication is banned in sport, complete a virtual reality testing mission, give ASADA feedback, report doping and more.\nDear APU Members,\nAs per 1 January 2021, a single Australian National Anti-Doping Policy for sports is officially adopted.\nThe Australian National Anti-Doping Policy reflects the 2021 World Anti-Doping Code and amendments to Australian anti-doping legislation. The purpose of the Australian National Anti-Doping Policy is to have a single and consistent set of anti-doping rules across all sports in Australia.\nSome of the key changes include:\n· A new Anti-Doping Rule Violation (ADRV): it is an offence to discourage or retaliate against someone from reporting possible doping activities\n· Protected Persons: a new category of athletes who will be afforded flexibility in consequences and no mandatory public disclosure\n· Substances of Abuse: reduced sanctions for athletes who test positive for ‘Substances of Abuse’ i.e. some social drugs such as cocaine and cannabis.\n· Education: a stronger emphasis on education for all cohorts, as outlined in the new International Standard for Education.\nReference: David Sharpe (CEO Sport Integrity Australia) emailed by Sport Integrity Australia\nPlease familiarize yourself with AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL ANTI-DOPING POLICY via content.cfm (powerlifting.org.au) OR Australian National Anti-Doping Policy | Sport Integrity Australia\nLifter : Kristy-Lee Swadling\nViolation Date : 2-Jun-19\nSubstance(s) : Dehydrochloromethyl-testosterone (DHCMT)\nStart : 24-Sep-20\nEnd : 25-Sep-24\nLifter : Alicia Bloom\nViolation Date : 27-03-2021\nSubstance(s) : Ostarine\nStart : 27-Mar-2021\nEnd : 27-Mar-2025', 'The vast majority of professional cyclists take nutritional supplements of some kind and they certainly aren’t alone – many amateur riders do as well. But according to several riders that have been accused of doping in recent years, nutrition supplements can often be to blame for a positive test.\nSo is that the case, or are these simply excuses in the wake of being caught out? How likely is it that taking nutritional supplements could lead to a positive test? And what can amateur cyclists (and indeed the pros) do to avoid an inadvertent positive test? Sports dietitian Alan McCubbin investigates.\nIn 2014 Orica-GreenEdge rider Daryl Impey tested positive for the banned substance Probenecid at the South African Road National Championships. Impey claimed that the substance had entered his system due to cross-contamination of gelatine capsules he purchased to fill with sodium bicarbonate (a legal supplement used to enhance high-intensity exercise performance).\nThe capsules, he argued, were bought from a local pharmacy in South Africa, where the pharmacist had recently handled Probenecid for a non-athletic customer (Probenecid is a medication used to treat gout). After providing sales records from the pharmacy to demonstrate the sequence of events, it was deemed likely that the pharmacist had traces of the substance on his hands, and Impey was not sanctioned.\nOf course this is one of many stories that have arisen in the wake of a doping positive, and the “contaminated supplements” defence has been used by many athletes over the years, with varying degrees of success. When Tom Danielson revealed he’d tested positive for synthetic testosterone on the eve of this year’s Tour of Utah he suggested that supplements might be to blame.\nI would never ever take anything like this especially after everything I have gone through the last years. This makes absolutely no sense\n— tom danielson (@tomdanielson) August 3, 2015\nI will now, as I wait for the B test, have the supplements I take, tested to see if this is what caused it.\n— tom danielson (@tomdanielson) August 3, 2015\nGiven that the majority (over 90% in some studies) of elite athletes use some form of dietary supplements, it’s not a surprise that this is often the reason cited when someone tests positive. And when you look at the supplement regimes employed by some WorldTour teams, it’s not just one or two products they’re taking.\nCheck out the catalogue of products used by Orica-GreenEdge, as seen during CyclingTips’ visit to the team’s service course in 2013.\nAnd it’s not just the pros that need to consider supplements and the potential doping risk they pose. With national anti-doping agencies testing at non-UCI-classified events – such as St. Kilda Cycling Club’s Supercrit in Melbourne or at Gran Fondo New York, say – amateur racers and those not competing at elite professional level still need to be aware of the risks.\nSo how big are those risks? That is, given how prevalent the use of nutritional supplements is, how likely is it that such supplements could be to blame for a positive test?\nDoping positives and supplement use\nIt’s impossible to say exactly how often positive doping tests (known by WADA as Adverse Analytical Findings, or AAFs) are caused by dietary supplements, either inadvertently or deliberately. But a look at AAF records and the substances in question can give us some insight.\nThe WADA website provides comprehensive stats on doping positives, the relevant sport and the nature of the substance(s) used. In the Australian lab in 2014 there were 62 AAFs, none of which came from cyclists. Not all AAFs result in an Anti-Doping Rule Violation (ADRV), as some of these may have come from athletes with a therapuetic use exemption (TUE) for the substance detected.\nLooking more closely, 22 (36%) of the Australian AAFs were for stimulants and 22 AAFs were for anabolic agents. The next highest category of substances was diuretics and masking agents, accounting for just six AAFs for the whole year.\nThis pattern of equal AAFs for stimulants and anabolic agents in Australia is in stark contrast to other countries – anabolic agents accounted for 49% of all AAFs worldwide in 2014, with just 15% coming from stimulants. Which raises the question – why is the Australian pattern skewed towards stimulants?\nAt a Sports Dietitians Australia Supplements Symposium in 2014, Dr Susan White (who sits on several anti-doping tribunals as well as having anti-doping roles with the International Swimming Federation FINA, and WADA), gave her thoughts on this unusual pattern. She believes it’s at least in part because ASADA (Australia’s anti-doping agency) is thought to test down to less elite levels of sport compared to many countries.\nThe AAFs for stimulants often occur in younger, less-educated athletes who inadvertently ingest them in dietary supplements in the days before competition. At the same time it appears Australian athletes are less likely to use (or at least less likely to be caught using) anabolic agents.\nA ASADA list shows that Methylhexanamine, a stimulant added to some pre-workout supplements, was a cause of the AAF in four of the 47 currently sanctioned Australian athletes. Five sanctions were for Oxilofrine, an ingredient found in some “fat burner” capsules, and one sanction resulted from sibutramine, an appetite suppressant which has turned up in some weight loss supplements.\nSo how likely is it that a supplement contains banned substances?\nThere are a few consumer surveys and published studies that investigate this issue. The most recent survey, conducted by LGC and published in 2013, involved the random selection and purchase of supplements available in the European market.\nThe products were then tested for the presence of banned substances. Of the 114 products tested, 13 contained at least one banned substance. This and other surveys have resulted in a commonly thrown-around figure that 10% of supplements are contaminated, implying that sports foods and supplements are inherently risky for athletes.\nBut that’s the overall figure. It turns out that some types of products are much higher risk than others. After speaking to those behind the survey, it turns out that 10 of the 13 contaminated products were either capsules (four) or tablets (six). The remaining three were powder-based products, while none of the liquid products (primarily sports drinks and ready-to-drink protein drinks) were contaminated.\nI spoke to LGC earlier this week and they confirmed the results of a similar survey in the Australian marketplace will be available in early 2016.\nWhy do supplements contain banned substances?\nThere are four ways that dietary supplements could lead to a positive test. Firstly and most obviously, the athlete may have taken a supplement knowing that it contains a banned substance, thinking they wouldn’t be tested or the substance would no longer be in their system by the time of the test.\nSecondly, there are countless stories (sadly many of them juniors) of athletes taking a supplement and testing positive, with no idea that the supplement contained a banned substance despite it being listed on the label. They make the assumption that if it can be bought at the health food store then it must be OK. But dietary supplements are made for a wide range of consumers, most of whom never compete in sports that comply with the WADA code.\nThese are particularly sad stories – often teenagers taking a supplement that well-meaning parents or friends provided for them, none of them having any idea that they contained banned substances. The kid is banned from sport, their reputation permanently tarnished. However there are ways for athletes to check the ingredients list of their supplements online (see below), so this situation is for the most part preventable.\nThirdly, an athlete may take a supplement that contains a banned substance that was not listed on the label. This can happen particularly for multi-ingredient supplements, many of which contain “proprietary blends” – code for “we’re not telling you exactly what’s in it and in what quantities”. But other supplements have been found in testing to contain ingredients that were not included on the label at all. In these cases the athlete may have inadvertently ingested a banned substance due to cross contamination somewhere in the manufacturing and distribution process.\nThis is the reason that capsules and tablets are the highest risk supplements. Liquids and many powdered products are often produced in food manufacturing facilities. In contrast, capsules and tablets are frequently made in the same facilities that produce prescription medications, increasing the likelihood of cross-contamination with traces of pharmaceuticals left on machinery.\nWhat should I do about it?\nWhile there are a few strategies you can employ, the only 100% guaranteed way to avoid a positive test is to not take dietary supplements at all. This is the line taken by ASADA in their athlete education sessions with athletes. This approach can be over-the-top though – I’ve heard stories of traumatised young athletes coming out of “the talk” from ASADA, too scared to buy a Gatorade from the local service station for fear of going positive.\nFor those who don’t get face-to-face ASADA education, there are some excellent free online learning modules on the ASADA website (minus the heavy-handed attitude of some of the educators) that cover all aspects of the WADA code, the drug testing process, and a section about supplements.\nBecause the high risk supplements are often the multi-ingredient products, go for supplements in pure form. This might mean buying multiple products instead of one, but it does allow more certainty about what you’re getting.\nIf you’ve got a supplement with an ingredients list that requires a biochemistry degree to interpret, ASADA also has a “Check Your Substances” website that allows you to check the individual ingredients listed on the label. Just plug in the ingredient name and it will tell you whether or not it’s a banned substance. But of course this only tells you about substances that appear on the label.\nTo minimise the risk of cross-contamination, third-party testing businesses have gained momentum in recent years. These companies test samples of every batch of a supplement for banned substances, certifying the batch that’s tested. The supplement companies pay for the testing and certification, with the cost either absorbed or passed onto the consumer.\nThe most well-known batch testing company in Australia, the UK and the US is Informed-Sport/Informed-Choice. Products that have been tested will display a certification label on the packaging, and this certification is now used as a key marketing strategy for several brands.\nSome of the brands more familiar to readers might include BodyScience, Etixx, Lucozade, Swisse, Science in Sport (SiS) and Beet It. Bear in mind that not all of a brand’s products (or all batches of a product) are tested, so only certain products will contain the certification logo.\nFinally, the small number of athletes funded through Cycling Australia’s High Performance Unit (HPU) are required to comply with CA’s sports supplement policy. Almost every National Sporting Organisation (NSO) developed similar policies in the wake of the “supplement scandal” at the Essendon AFL club in 2012 (which ironically had nothing to do with dietary supplements, but that’s another story).\nThe CA policy requires all HPU athletes to consult their program’s sports dietitian prior to commencing any supplements, to ensure the product is both appropriate and necessary. They are also required to provide a list of all sports foods and supplements they use or intend to use (yes, even the brand of gels and sports drinks) and have them approved by the CA Supplements Standards and Policy Committee every six months. This list of supplements is then recorded in a central register. This is designed to ensure appropriate professionals are checking off the supplements an athlete uses to minimise the risk of supplement misuse and anti-doping violations.\nSo yes, there is a serious risk of inadvertent doping when using dietary supplements. And yes, there’s a chance that you could be tested, even if you’re not taking part in a professional race. Some types of supplements are higher risk than others. But by reading labels, checking ingredients against the ASADA website, being cautious about capsules and tablets (and potentially buying those certified by a third-party tester), cyclists at all levels of the sport can minimise their risk of a nasty surprise following a doping control.']	['<urn:uuid:adc43615-3cd4-43f3-a33d-4342f0ceeb82>', '<urn:uuid:3acfdb0e-deab-4a8a-8bb1-49a4f7ae2cb6>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	36	133	3390
3	What treatments are available for colon cancer and lymphoma, and what are their side effects?	For colon cancer, treatments include surgery (like polypectomy, colectomy), chemotherapy (given as pills or injections), targeted therapies, and various radiation treatments including brachytherapy, 3D-conformal radiation, IMRT, and proton therapy. For lymphoma, treatments include chemotherapy (like R-CHOP), radiation therapy, and immunotherapy. Both cancers' treatments can cause side effects like fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Some side effects may appear during treatment, while others can develop months or years later as 'late effects'. Long-term effects can include heart disease, especially after chest radiation for lymphoma, and other complications that require ongoing monitoring and follow-up care.	"['Your colon cancer treatment at MD Anderson may include one or more of the following therapies:\nSurgery is the most common treatment for colon cancer, especially if it has not spread. As for many cancers, surgery for colon cancer is most successful when done by a surgeon with a great deal of experience in the procedure.\nColon cancer may be treated with surgery alone, surgery and chemotherapy, and/or other treatments. Chemotherapy or radiation may be given:\n- Before surgery to make the cancer smaller. This is called neoadjuvant therapy.\n- After surgery to help keep you cancer-free. This is called adjuvant therapy.\nThe type of surgery depends on the stage and location of the tumor:\nPolypectomy: A colonoscope, which is a long tube with a camera on the end, is inserted into the rectum and guided to the polyp. A tiny, scissor-like tool or wire loop removes the polyp.\nColectomy: The area of the colon where the cancer is, along with some healthy surrounding tissue, is removed. The associated lymph nodes are removed (biopsied) and looked at under a microscope. Usually the surgeon then rejoins the parts of the colon. This surgery also is called a hemicolectomy or partial colectomy.\nYour doctor will decide whether it is best to perform traditional open surgery or minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery.\nWith minimally invasive surgery, small cuts are made in the abdomen. A tiny camera and surgical instruments are inserted. The surgeon then uses video imaging to perform the surgery. MD Anderson surgeons are among the most experienced in the nation in minimally invasive colon cancer surgery.\nEndoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) may be used if the cancer is small and only on the surface of the colon.

In lymphoma treatment and after effects general, the type of side effects seen with radiotherapy depends on the area of the body which has been treated. Like any cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) can result in physical and emotional challenges during treatment, particularly if chemotherapy and radiation—the treatments used most often—have.\nSide effects can be an uncomfortable part of treating cancer and can vary depending on the length and type of treatment you undergo. But some cancers do fall back out of remission after treatment. The good news is that there are medications available to combat these illnesses. Therefore, it is important for people to receive follow-up care to watch for the following late effects. Treatments have improved in the last 30 years, and now people who are treated for lymphoma recently are less likely to experience late effects. They are probably asking what to do next. Felipe Samaniego, M.\nFor other patients, side effects can be more severe, sometimes requiring hospitalization. Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting are all products of chemotherapy. After 35 years or more, patients still had a 4- to 6-fold increased standardized incidence ratio of CHD or HF compared with the general population, corresponding to 857 excess events per 10,000 person-years.

Osteoporosis can be caused by the cancer itself, cortisone-type drugs, treatment-induced menopause, cancer cells in the bone marrow and treatments that affect testosterone levels. The goal of treatment is to kill the cancer cells, but cancer treatments can damage normal cells too which causes side effects.\nAfter surviving lymphoma treatments, patients should be on the lookout for late effects. After finishing lymphoma treatments and entering remission, a patient can be left with a lot of questions. Patients react to treatments in lymphoma treatment and after effects different ways. When 25-year-old Alex Hawkins was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin&39;s lymphoma 4 years ago, she wasn&39;t prepared for the treatment side effects that lay lymphoma treatment and after effects ahead.

4	I'm doing research on how feminist criticism has evolved over time - what was one of the main problems with early feminist literary theory according to critics?	According to critics, early feminist theory had a significant problem with its narrow focus on white middle-class women, excluding many marginalized groups. As Susan Lanser points out, it only considered 'a small group of women whose politics may be no less conservative than those of the men with whom they sit on corporate and collegiate boards of trustees,' while ignoring women who worked as domestics for these feminists.	['RAPIDLY CHANGING PARADIGMS\nOne of the difficulties of simply defining one or two theories for my focus is that Feminist Literary Theory is a combination of a wide variety of theoretical lenses, including Gender Theory, Reader-Response Theory, Close Reading, and Deconstruction among others, and the feminist approach to literature is currently in a state of change. In 1985, Susan S. Lanser notes that “[f]eminist criticism ha[d] been challenged and enriched in turn by new theories and practices whose possibilities it helped to create” (4). These were common methodologies at the start of the twenty-first century, but this is changing. Keeping in mind the changing nature of the field, I would consider women’s poetry and how women poets define themselves and other women through their poetry, through close-reading, linguistics, and likely, the theoretical position of philosophers like Derrida or Barthes.\nDIVERSITY AND PROMISE\nThe field of Feminist Literary Criticism seems a field of diverse theories and methodologies that has exploded in myriad directions. Feminist Literary scholars are pulling from all criticisms and drawing on many methodologies. The original feminist theorists have genuine staying power, and their theories are being fused with new theoretical and methodological approaches This makes the prevailing theories in Feminist Literary Criticism elusive. Trying to pin down particular favored theory is like trying to catch a greased pig—I think I’ve gotten it, but as soon as I think I do, it’s taken off again. In my interview with Dr. Alison Reed from ODU’s English Department, she mentioned that her current project focused on a performative social justice study, which is not based on a traditional text and is far from the traditional research paradigms of the twentieth-century.\nTHE THEORISTS (SOME OF THEM)\nEarly Feminist Theory that relied on Freud and Lacan, Byam points out, is based on psychoanalytic approaches that are inherently misogynistic, implying that women desire to be men. Even the feminist’s initial dichotomy of gender becomes problematic (102). While discussing feminist approaches to earlier eras, Byam states that feminist criticism has never been formalist, “if formalism means being preoccupied or even more than superficially interested in technique” (108). The critical conversations about methodology and theory drop off at the end of the twentieth-century, and then, the focus becomes applying various theories to different literary works. As for method, the tried and true research, collecting and examining secondary sources and Close Reading of the material, is still widely practiced, but even that seems to be giving way to experiment as scholars explore philosophical theories like Derrida‘s Deconstruction, and his assertion, “Everything is a text” (Rawlings).\nWHO’S WHO? AND MIXING THINGS UP\nThe authoritative works, the works that appear significantly in present critical theory, go back to the original feminist theorists: Adrienne Rich, Audre Lorde, Kate Millet, Elaine Showalter, and Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar and to gender theorist Judith Butler figure heavily in contemporary scholarly criticism.\nMoving into Reader-Response, retaining Close Reading, experimenting and applying many theories alone and in combination to literature old and new, and often that which the scholar deems significant enough for inclusion in the canon. Even Shira Wolosky considers women’s poetry through a variety of theoretical frameworks: including but not limited to feminist psychological, feminist political, and feminist poetics and aesthetic theories.\nINTERSECTIONALITY TO POLITICAL ECOLOGY\nLanser points out the narrowly defined woman of early feminism, “only a small group of women whose politics may be no less conservative than those of the men with whom they sit on corporate and collegiate boards of trustees” and quotes Audre Lorde in pointing out that the women omitted from consideration were those who worked as domestics for these feminists “while [the feminists] were attending conferences on feminist theory” (5). The same trap that lead scholars to “the Utopian expectation that all works by women would be ideological correct in all particulars,” but were then faced with the dilemmas of classist and lesbian authors (Byam 114). Feminism has shifted its focus from white middle-class women to Intersectionality (recognizing the many ways women can be and are marginalized) and now toward political ecology, recognizing the real needs of marginalized women in other, particularly third-world, countries (Sunila Abeyskera 7). Scholars need to define themselves in terms of how their “own lived experiences reflect [their] literary commitments and affinities” and consider what other feminisms “look like” (Reed). Ihab Hassan quotes Steven Best and Douglas Kellner’s The Postmodern Turn, “Yet we must all heed politics because it structures our theoretical consents, literary evasions, critical rescuancies” (125). In these ways, scholars, including me, can avoid the unfortunate “you can’t speak for me”—“what about us” dichotomy and the vulnerabilities of early feminism and gynocritics that excluded and erased large populations of marginalized women.\nAbeysekera, Sunila. “Shifting Feminisms: From Intersectionality to Political Ecology.” Talking Points.

5	hercules aircraft history how did number of propeller blades change with newer models	The C-130A Hercules initially used a three-bladed propeller for its 4050 shp Allison T56-9 turboprops. Later models used four blades when power increased to 4590 shp with Allison T56-A-15 turboprops. The C-130J Super Hercules now uses 6 blades to handle the 4,637 shp from Rolls-Royce AE 2100D3 turboprop.	"[""I have heard that propellers with more than four blades are not as efficient as 4 or less blades because of lower thrust which may result from interfering prop-streams. But I see the ATR-42/72 and they have 6 blades. What is the reasoning and the advantages to that prop layout?\nYou are right, more blades are bad for efficiency (follow the link for the definition). Ideally, a propeller should have only one blade. Every additional blade will cause disturbances which interfere with the flow on the other blades.\nWhen engine power increases, the propeller disc area should also grow, but this growth is limited by the resulting speed of the blade tips. Once the flow speed there becomes supersonic, the drag at this section of the blade increases without a corresponding increase in thrust. To avoid that, the next best option is to increase the solidity ratio of the propeller, called also the activity ratio. This is done by either increasing blade chord or the number of blades.\nMake no mistake, this is bad for efficiency. But if there is enough power available, adding more blades is the best way to transform that engine power into thrust.\nTake the Supermarine Spitfire:\n- The prototype, powered by the 1,030 hp Rolls-Royce PV-12, had a two-bladed propeller\n- From the Mk II, a three-bladed propeller was fitted to accommodate the increasing power of the RR Merlin (1,470 hp for the Spitfire Mk V).\n- With the Mk IX, a four-bladed propeller was needed for the 1,575 hp of the supercharged Merlin 61.\n- From the Mk XII, the more powerful Rolls-Royce Griffon made a five-bladed propeller necessary. Engine power was raised from 1,735 hp to 2,300 hp for the last variant, the Mk XXIV.\nRolls-Royce Griffon-powered Supermarine Spitfire (picture source)\nA lower prop speed allows to increase its diameter, but while tip speed will drop by less than the reduction in prop speed (after all, flight speed should not change), the available thrust from this propeller will drop by the square of the speed reduction, since thrust is proportional to the dynamic pressure on the blades. And thrust you get only from the circumferential fraction of the local speed at the blade; flight speed does not count here and does not help to mitigate the reduction. Consequence: You cannot make the propeller bigger and spin it more slowly for a given power.\nSV-27 propellers on the An-70 (picture source). Eight blades in the forward disc and six in the rear, running at only 1200 RPM. In order to reduce Mach effects, all blades have a swept tip and deep chord.\nThis can only be topped by something like an ungeared turbofan with a ducted propeller. A turbofan, in other words.\nFirst, we have to define what is efficiency. In case of propeller, we can define efficiency as the ratio of output power (ability of the propeller to produce a given thrust at a given airspeed) and input power (i.e. the shaft power of the engine).\nAll else held constant, the efficiency the propeller decreases as the number of blades increase due to aerodynamic reasons (like interference). However, if the engine power is increased, the propeller should be able to 'absorb' that; i.e. transmit engine power to the air flow passing through the propeller disk, adding energy and generating thrust.\nIf the engine power is increased, there are a number of ways to make the propellers absorb it, each with is own share of issues:\nIncrease angle of attack i.e. blade pitch- The pitch angle is usually set at a value where the aerodynamic efficiency is optimal. Changing it may make the blade inefficient.\nIncrease the blade diameter The causes two major problems- Longer blades means more tip speed, which increases drag once it reaches transonic speeds; also, the longer blades means longer landing gear for tip clearance or more clearance between two propellers and/or fuselage. This increased structural weight is unacceptable as leads to a vicious cycle. An extreme case of this is the F4U Corsair, which had an inverted gull wing to accommodate the huge three bladed propeller required for the extremely powerful engine.\nIncrease the rpm The problem is again the tip speed, which can increase drag significantly at high speeds.\nRedesign the blade with more camber Again, the blades are usually at their optimal aerodynamic efficiency; increasing the camber may lead to less efficient blades.\nIncrease the chord This increases the solidity, improving efficiency; however, this leads to increased interference between the blades, which is again bad.\nIncrease the number of blades This is usually the solution adopted for reasons above. The blades may become inefficient, but the system is able to produce more thrust with minimum impact (like maintenance etc.). As Hartzell says,\n...efficiency doesn’t propel the airplane, thrust does\nA good example of the effect of the engine power on the number of propeller blades can be seen in the case of Lockheed Martin C130 Hercules.\nThe initial model, the C-130A used a three bladed propeller to absorb the 4050 shp of Allison T56-9 turboprops.\nLater models used a four bladed propeller as the engine power was increased to 4590 shp in Allison T56-A-15 turboprops.\nThe C-130J Super Hercules uses a 6 bladed propeller to absorb the 4,637 shp from Rolls-Royce AE 2100D3 turboprop.\nIn extreme cases like the Tu-95, contra rotating propellers had to be used to absorb the power from the engines.""]"	['<urn:uuid:21243600-a454-421c-8f09-29cb8f707fb2>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	13	48	907
6	What's the difference between using GarageBand and using swing settings when trying to make music sound more natural?	GarageBand and swing settings serve different purposes for making music sound natural. GarageBand is a pre-installed Mac software that provides an easy way to create music through recording live instruments or assembling loops, particularly useful for beginners. Swing settings, on the other hand, are a specific feature in DAWs that make rhythms sound more organic by pushing certain notes slightly off the timing grid, similar to how a real drummer might play. Swing dates back to the 1930s jazz era and can be adjusted to various degrees to create looser, more lively grooves.	"['What is groove, exactly? As music producers we talk about groove all the time, but it can be difficult to explain in great detail. Groove is a feeling, a vibe, a special quality that makes music sound good.\nEven though the concept of groove seems elusive, it can be broken down into concrete terms using two key DAW features: swing and syncopation.\nA brief history of groove\nIn electronic music production, swing has to do with how far a sequence deviates from the metronomic grid. The further you push a sequence off grid, the more swung it is. Without any swing, a sequence is considered “straight”—the individual notes are evenly spaced and quantized. In some musical styles, like Detroit electro, this kind of machine-like accuracy is helpful, whereas others seem to work better with rhythmic variation.\nSwing dates back to the 1930s, when it was originally considered a jazz genre and playing style that emphasized slightly delayed 1/8 notes. Bandleader and American pianist Duke Ellington championed swing, on full display in his song “Skin Deep” (skip to 30 seconds for the drums). By the 1980s, drum machines featured swing settings that could produce loose and lively grooves. The Linn LM-1 was the first drum machines to incorporate swing (called ‘shuffle mode’) proving that machines can groove too.\nSwing and syncopation in practice\nToday, all DAWs come with editable swing parameters used to approximate organic sounding, unquantized music. Although swing can be applied to any instrument, it is mainly used in reference to drums, which will be the focus of the following audio examples.\nLet’s start with a drum loop without any swing, i.e. a “straight” groove.\nBasic 4/4 drum pattern with a kick, snare and hi hat.\nHere we have a 1/4 note kick drum pattern that produces a note on each beat, met by a snare on the second and fourth beat, also called the backbeat. There’s a 1/16 note closed and open hi-hat pattern too. No swing has been applied yet. For some extra aesthetic richness and warmth, I used Vintage Tape.\nOpening up Groove Pool in Ableton Live\nI’ve chosen a swing value based on a 1/16 note pattern—it pushes the second and fourth 1/16 note forward in time, making them sound late while everything else remains quantized to the grid. This somewhat mimics the slight timing delays that a drummer introduces when they perform. Swung patterns (as opposed to straight) are generally more effective at getting people to move and dance. Here goes:\nThe swing frees up space for the sequence to breathe and a skipping groove becomes noticeable. In Ableton Live, hit Commit to apply the swing to your clip permanently. This will move your drum pattern depending on the swing settings, making the timing differences clear.\nCommiting to a groove in Ableton Live\nYou can also separate the individual sounds of your drum rack to different tracks. Rather than a global swing value, each sound will have it’s own, offering more rhythmic possibilities. The intensity, velocity, timing and randomness of a swing file can be adjusted to your liking.\nFind your own groove\nThe swing settings offered by modern DAWs can quickly inject sequences with sophisticated rhythmic energy and feel. If the music you make demands quantization, find other ways to spice up your programmed patterns—either through syncopation or placement of drum sounds.\nWhenever you can, let your own natural groove into your production. Instead of inputting notes via step-time, try to play them out on your MIDI keyboard or sampler. If your recordings are too loose, apply quantization at 25–50%. This will tighten things up while keeping some personality from the original.\nAnother way to approach groove is by extracting the template from live recorded drums or other instrument parts. If you recorded a great keyboard section, for example, you can use that as the template for your drums or bass patterns. You can also extract a groove files from samples. In Ableton, the groove will appear in Groove Pool menu under the same name as the clip.\nExtracting a groove in Ableton Live\nWhatever you choose to do, focus on being rhythmically creative. Quantization and preset groove files have their place in electronic music production, but letting your own groove flow through you will lead to results no one else can produce.', ""Join Garrick Chow for an in-depth discussion in this video Choosing a digital audio workstation (DAW), part of Audio and Music Production Careers: First Steps.\n- One of the most daunting aspects of getting started in audio is deciding which digital audio workstation, or DAW, to choose for the work you'll be doing. Your DAW's going to be the central location where you'll record, create, edit and mix your audio files. So it's essential to find the one that works best for you. But as you dig around, you'll quickly find that there are dozens of options out there. Sometimes there are even multiple versions of the same DAW, each designed for a specific needs. But generally, most professional-level DAWs these days are capable of the same things that their competitors are capable of. All DAWs allow you to take recordings or electronically-generated music and edit, mix and manipulate them into a final project.\nYou'll find that some DAWs are more suited for recording live audio, while others are geared more towards electronic musicians who work more with audio loops, sequencers and synthesizers. Some DAWs come packed with tons of plugins and effects, while others have less robust processing features. But the feature set of a DAW is not going to be the only determining factor. Other factors that may affect your decision include the platforms the DAW is available on, whether or not you need specialized hardware to run the DAW, and of course the price. Fortunately, almost all publishers of DAW software offer free demo versions of their software that usually either function for a limited time or with limited features.\nBut a demo should be enough to get you an accurate idea of whether or not you'll be able to use a particular program for your working projects. Let's take a look at some of the most popular options that are available at the moment. If you're just starting out, the best all may be the one you already have. For example if you're using a Mac, an obvious jumping-off point would be Apple GarageBand which comes pre-installed on all new Macs. GarageBand is a great all-purpose tool for anyone who wants an easy way to create music, either by recording it live through real or built-in instruments or by assembling loops into complete projects. Which can be especially useful for people who aren't musically-inclined.\nIt also excels for producing non-music-related projects like podcasts or other spoken word pieces. GarageBand provides an easy entry into multi-track recording and producing, and if you're a hobbyist, it might be the only DAW you ever need. But if you want to perform more sophisticated edits, or you begin to find its features lacking, you'll want to eventually step things up to a more professional-level DAW. A natural progression from GarageBand would be to Apple Logic Pro. Logic Pro takes the concepts and workflows from GarageBand and extends them to the next level. And it also throws in an incredible number of plugins and an enormous library of sounds.\nNow of course, both GarageBand and Logic Pro are Mac-only. One cross-platform digital audio workstation you've most likely heard of is Pro Tools. Pro Tools is considered by many to be the industry standard software for recording, editing, and mixing audio. And it's used heavily in professional recording studios and post-production facilities because of the quality of its editing tools and audio summing. This brings up another fact you could consider when choosing a DAW. If there's a chance you might be working on your project partly on your own, and partly in a studio, you'll want to consider using the same software the studio uses.\nNow there are always way to export or port audio from one DAW to work in another, but it's always easier when you're using the same DAW. While Pro Tools may be used in many professional studios these days, you'll find that it may not be preferred in others or by other people you collaborate with. Especially since many other DAWs had brought their feature sets up to par over the past few years. One of Pro Tools' downsides is its price, which can be prohibitive if you're just starting out. A nice alternative DAW that gives you many of the same features and functionality as Pro Tools is Reaper. Reaper is another professional-level DAW that's available on both Mac and Windows but with a considerably smaller price tag.\nAnd it's also one of the most customizable DAWs out there today. In addition to providing you with the ability to record, edit, and mix your audio projects, it also allows you to adjust the look and contents of nearly all of its windows and menus so that you can create a workspace that's completely tailored to the way you prefer to work. Other DAWs that fall into relatively the same category as Logic Pro, Pro Tools, and Reaper include Cubase, Studio One, Sonar, and Digital Performer. Cubase, Studio One, and Digital Performer are available for both Macs and Windows while Sonar is Windows-only.\nBut all four have impressive feature sets and options and are great tools for recording, editing, and mixing audio. However if you're more into programming virtual instruments rather than recording live instruments, you might find tools more suited to you in a DAW like Ableton Live. Ableton Live is another cross-platform app. But it focuses on the needs of electronic musicians, providing thousands of loops, samples, and virtual instruments. It's especially useful if you need a DAW for live performances, and in fact, some performers and DJs use Ableton Live as a musical instrument.\nAnother DAW in this category is Bitwig Studio. Bitwig is a flexible, multi-platform music-creation system that's great for both music production and live performances as well as DJ-ing. It also includes a technology called Open Controller API that allows anyone to create custom controller scripts for hardware controllers like keyboards and drum pads. So if external hardware controllers are important to you, Bitwig is especially worth a look. Along the same lines, another DAW that excels for electronic music production is Reason.\nA loop-based music-creation application with a focus on MIDI sequencing, sampling and sense. It has a unique interface design which can be a little bit daunting at first. But if you want to produce electronic music, you have to at least give reason to try it. Another DAW that employs a unique design but is Windows-only is FL Studio. FL Studio makes it easy to combine loops, samples, and recording music into a complete project. And it's hugely popular among hip hop musicians and producers. Another cross-platform DAW you may already have access to is Adobe Audition, which comes as part of the Adobe Creative Cloud suite of application packages.\nAdobe Audition is a powerful audio editor that's especially useful when working with audio from other Creative Cloud apps like Premiere Pro and After Effects. Although it also operates just fine on its own. Audition allows you to work with single audio files or multi-track projects. It has a great selection audio restoration and correction tools. And it can also play back video which is useful when you're editing or scoring through a video. If you're currently an Adobe customer, Audition may already be installed on your Mac or PC. If you don't have the Adobe suite and you're looking for an application that also excels at audio restoration, as well as fall conversion and mastering tasks, Sound Forge might be good choice.\nNow if you're sitting there thinking that all these programs are too daunting or too powerful for what you need to do, maybe just need to edit down a recording or a lecture, record or edit a radio broadcast, or record a quick voiceover for a PowerPoint Presentation you're putting together, there are still other options available. For instance you might want to look into Audacity. Audacity is a free and open-source audio editor for both Mac, Windows, and even Linux. And it gives you the ability to record and edit audio in a simple but powerful interface. It comes with a large collection of effects you can apply to your recordings, and it's able to export your audio in a variety of formats.\nIf you're looking for a simple audio editor to start out with, Audacity is a great choice. Or maybe you're looking for something more portable. While all of the DAWs I've mentioned so far can be run on a Mac or Windows laptop, many people these days are turning to devices like the iPad to act as the recording race. There are a variety of audio interfaces that allow you to plug in mics, guitars and other instruments to your iPad. And you'll find dozens of apps designed specifically for recording, editing and mixing audio on the iPad. For example, Auria Pro is an app that allows you to record up to 24 tracks simultaneously and offers a virtually unlimited number of tracks to record onto.\nYou can then edit, mix, and export directly from your iPad without ever having to connect to a computer. In contrast, the iPad version of GarageBand is a fully-functioning DAW that allows you to record audio tracks as well as utilize entire collections of smart instruments which enable you to easily play or program drums, keyboard, guitar, bass, and string instruments into your project right from the iPad touch interface. An alternative to the iPad for music production is the Microsoft Surface.\nMost DAWs that run on Windows run on the Surface. And you can even use the Surface for writing music notation. As you can see, there's an entire world of options available when it comes to selecting a DAW. If you're just starting out, download and trial several DAWs to see which has the best feature set that suits you and which one feels the best to use.""]"	['<urn:uuid:fa6d647b-2a0e-4404-92cc-d83d46547f0d>', '<urn:uuid:23a603de-fb00-42c3-bc10-320f35bb640c>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	18	93	2376
7	What is the relationship between the Census of Marine Life project's findings and the current challenges of ocean acidification for marine species?	The Census of Marine Life project identified more than 1 million ocean species, with less than a quarter currently described in scientific literature. This baseline of marine biodiversity is now facing significant threats from ocean acidification. Since the Industrial Revolution, ocean pH has decreased from 8.2 to 8.1, representing a 26 percent increase in acidity over roughly 250 years - a rate 100 times faster than anything ocean inhabitants have experienced in tens of millions of years. This rapid acidification particularly threatens the survival of the numerous marine calcifiers discovered in the census, including corals, shellfish, and plankton, which form the base of marine food webs. The census's baseline will be crucial for monitoring how these identified species respond to increasing acidification, as many are already showing slower calcification rates and increased larval mortality.	"[""Loriciferans can live their entire lives hidden in sediment on the seafloor without oxygen (Image: Roberto Danovaro/COML)\nStudy identifies more than 1 million ocean species\nAlok Jha, Guardian science and environment correspondent\n5th October, 2010\nThe Census of Marine Life is finally complete after a decade of work by 2,700 scientists from 80 countries\nIt is the culmination of a decade of work by 2,700 scientists from 80 countries, who went on more than 540 expeditions into the farthest reaches of the most mysterious realm on the planet – the world's oceans.\nToday, the US$650 million Census of Marine Life (COML) project announced the culmination of its work, concluding that the deep is home to more than a million species – of which less than a quarter are described in the scientific literature.\nSince the project started in 2000, around 16,000 species have been added to the COML databases and more than 5,000 are still being worked on by scientists. In total, around 2,600 scientific papers have been published as part of the project.\nJesse Ausubel, environmental scientist at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and co-founder of the COML project said that the results had far exceeded any vision he had started with.\n'On the one hand we feel like the people in London and Paris who, 250 years ago, were creating the first dictionaries and encyclopaedias. In 2000, there was a chaos with regards the information about marine life. Now we have a valid list of species, 201,000 as of yesterday. 90,000 of these species have web pages in the Encyclopaedia of Life. 35,000 of these have DNA sequences. It's not your grandfather's census: this census is this wonderful, living, interactive set of databases on the internet with hyperlinks to images, sounds, the ability to create maps.'\nThe COML will form a baseline against which scientists will be able to monitor biodiversity changes as they are affected by a range of environmental factors. 'We live in a world of very rapid change,' said Ausubel. 'Increasing illumination and sound in the ocean, the removal of sea life, acidification, changes in temperature and currents. We want to monitor and evaluate the effects of these and other activities. We can't do any of these in the absence of baselines. We hope what the census has done is create the first baseline and create a framework in which it is easy to add more information about marine plants or other newly-discovered animals.'\nTo mark the end of the COML project, scientists at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) showed off the results of the Census of Antarctic Marine Life, an inventory of more than 16,000 marine species and the culmination of more than 19 trips into Antarctic waters.\nHuw Griffiths, a marine biologist at the BAS said that identifying new species sometimes required specialist techniques. With the help of a team from New Zealand, BAS identified a a new species of amphipod crustacean, which looks a bit like a shrimp. 'Natural variation in the shape and colour of this creature makes it difficult to tell if the ones we found were the same type of species, or not. Using DNA barcoding it was possible to identify this animal as a different species that was new to science.'\nUnderstanding what lives in the Southern Ocean has helped scientists to identify a benchmark against which they can measure the effects of climate change, he added. 'The marine life we study in Antarctica is, naturally, vulnerable to these effects including warming sea surface temperatures, rising ocean acidification and decreasing winter sea ice. But we've also seen just how resilient some of these creatures can be, surviving and thriving in some of the most challenging conditions on the planet.'\nDespite a decade of work and 9,000 days at sea, however, there is much still to be done. COML scientists estimate that 10 per cent of the species in European oceans have yet to be described. Around South Africa that figure is 38 per cent, in Antarctica it is 39 to 58 per cent, for Japan it is 70 per cent, the Mediterranean deep-sea 75 per cent and Australia 80 per cent.\nIan Poiner, chair of the COML steering committee, said: 'All surface life depends on life inside and beneath the oceans. Sea life provides half of our oxygen and a lot of our food and regulates climate. We are all citizens of the sea. And while much remains unknown, including at least 750,000 undiscovered species and their roles, we are better acquainted now with our fellow travellers and their vast habitat on this globe.'\nCensus of Marine Life (COML) project\nThis article is reproduced courtesy of the Guardian Environment Network\nSeagrass may be 'uncharismatic' but it still needs protecting\nIt may be not be as visible as tropical rainforests or wetlands but seagrass plays a vital role in the global ecosystem, says Richard Unsworth, filtering pollution and providing food to fish\nSuffocating seas: how climate change is reducing ocean oxygen levels\nThe main impacts of climate change - changing weather patterns, melting glaciers, sea level rise - are well known. But its ability to reduce oxygen levels in the deep ocean is little reported...\nToxic dispersants in Gulf oil spill creating hidden marine crisis\nMore than 200 million tons of crude oil have gushed into the Gulf of Mexico since the rupture of Deepwater Horizon.

Like global warming, this phenomenon, which is known as ocean acidification, is a direct consequence of increasing levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in Earth’s atmosphere.\nPrior to industrialization, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 280 parts per million (ppm). With increased use of fossil fuels, that number is now approaching 400 ppm and the growth rate is accelerating. Scientists calculate that the ocean is currently absorbing about one quarter of the carbon dioxide that humans are emitting. When carbon dioxide combines with seawater, chemical reactions occur that reduce the seawater pH, hence the term ocean acidification.\nCurrently, about half of the anthropogenic (human-caused) carbon dioxide in the ocean is found in the upper 400 meters (1,200 feet) of the water column, while the other half has penetrated into the lower thermocline and deep ocean. Density- and wind-driven circulation help mix the surface and deep waters in some high latitude and coastal regions, but for much of the open ocean, deep pH changes are expected to lag surface pH changes by a few centuries.\nOcean acidification and global warming are different problems, but are closely linked because they share the same root cause—human emissions of carbon dioxide. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide is now higher than it has been for the last 800,000 years and possibly higher than any time in the last 20 million years. Humans have thus far benefited from the ocean’s capacity to hold enormous amounts of carbon, including a large portion of this excess carbon dioxide. Had the ocean not absorbed such vast quantities of carbon dioxide, the atmospheric concentration would be even higher, and the environmental consequences of global warming (sea level rise, shifting weather patterns, more extreme weather events, etc.) and their associated socioeconomic impacts would likely be even more pronounced. However, the oceans cannot continue to absorb carbon dioxide at the current rate without undergoing significant changes in chemistry, biology, and ecosystem structure.\nMeasuring ocean acidification: Past and present\nScientists know that the oceans are absorbing carbon dioxide and subsequently becoming more acidic from measurements made on seawater collected during research cruises, which provide wide spatial coverage over a short time period, and from automated ocean carbon measurements on stationary moorings, which provide long-term, high-resolution data from a single location.\nThese records can be extended back through time using what are known as chemical proxies to provide an indirect measurement of seawater carbonate chemistry. A proxy is a measurement from a natural archive (ice cores, corals, tree rings, marine sediments, etc.) that is used to infer past environmental conditions. For example, by analyzing the chemical composition of tiny fossil shells found in deep ocean sediments, scientists have developed ocean pH records from ancient times when there were no pH meters. Furthermore, because the ocean surface water is in approximate chemical balance, or equilibrium, with the atmosphere above it, a record of historical ocean pH can be inferred from atmospheric carbon dioxide records derived from Greenland and Antarctic ice cores, which contain air bubbles from the ancient atmosphere. Such evidence indicates that current atmospheric carbon dioxideconcentrations and ocean pH levels are at unprecedented for at least the last 800,000 years.\nGoing back deeper in Earth history to the Paleocene-Eocene boundary about 55 million years ago, scientists have found geochemical evidence of a massive release of carbon dioxide accompanied by substantial warming and dissolution of shallow carbonate sediments in the ocean. Although somewhat analogous to what we are observing today, this carbon dioxide release occurred over several thousand years, much more slowly than what we are witnessing today, thus providing time for the oceans partially to buffer the change. In the geologic record, during periods of rapid environmental change, species have acclimated, adapted or gone extinct. Corals have undergone large extinction events in the past (such the Permian extinction 250 million years ago), and new coral species evolved to take their place, but it took millions of years to recover previous levels of biodiversity.\nHow is ocean acidification affecting ocean chemistry?\nSeawater has a pH of 8.2 on average because it contains naturally occurring alkaline ions that come primarily from weathering of continental rocks. When seawater absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, carbonic acid is produced (see Box 1), reducing the water’s pH. Since the dawn of industrialization, average surface ocean pH has decreased to about 8.1.\nBecause the pH scale is logarithmic (a change of 1 pH unit represents a tenfold change in acidity), this change represents a 26 percent increase in acidity over roughly 250 years, a rate that is 100 times faster than anything the ocean and its inhabitants have experienced in tens of millions of years.\nAcidification can affect many marine organisms, but especially those that build their shells and skeletons from calcium carbonate, such as corals, oysters, clams, mussels, snails, and phytoplankton and zooplankton, the tiny plants and animals that form the base of the marine food web.\nThese “marine calcifiers” face two potential threats associated with ocean acidification: 1) Their shells and skeletons may dissolve more readily as ocean pH decreases and seawater becomes more corrosive; and 2) When CO2 dissolves in seawater, the water chemistry changes such that fewer carbonate ions, the primary building blocks for shells and skeletons, are available for uptake by marine organisms. Marine organisms that build shells or skeletons usually do so through an internal chemical process that converts bicarbonate to carbonate in order to form calcium carbonate.\nExactly how ocean acidification slows calcification rates, or shell formation, is not yet fully understood, but several mechanisms are being studied. Most hypotheses focus on the additional energy an organism must expend to build and maintain its calcium carbonate shells and skeletons in an increasingly corrosive environment. In the face of this extra energy expenditure, exposure to additional environmental stressors (increasing ocean temperatures, decreasing oxygen availability, disease, loss of habitat, etc.) will likely compound the problem.\nThese effects are already being documented in many marine organisms, particularly in tropical and deep-sea corals, which exhibit slower calcification rates under more acidic conditions. The impact on corals is of great concern because they produce massive calcium carbonate structures called reefs that provide habitat for many marine animals, including commercially important fish and shellfish species that use the reefs as nursery grounds. Coral reefs are vital to humans as sources of food and medicine, protection from storms, and the focus of eco-tourism. In addition to corals, studies have shown that acidification impairs the ability of some calcifying plankton, tiny floating plants and animals at the base of the food web, to build and maintain their shells. Scientists have also observed increased larval mortality rates of several commercially important fish and shellfish.\nWhat can we expect in the future?\nOcean acidification is occurring at a rate 30 to100 times faster than at any time during the last several million years driven by the rapid growth rate atmospheric CO2 that is almost unprecedented over geologic history. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), economic and population scenarios predict that atmospheric CO2 levels could reach 500 ppm by 2050 and 800 ppm or more by the end of the century. This will not only lead to significant temperature increases in the atmosphere and ocean, but will further acidify ocean water, reducing the pH an estimated 0.3 to 0.4 units by 2100, a 150 percent increase in acidity over preindustrial times. Assuming a “business-as-usual” IPCC CO2 emission scenario, predictive models of ocean biogeochemistry project that surface waters of the Arctic and Southern Oceans will become undersaturated with aragonite (a more soluble form of calcium carbonate) within a few decades, meaning that these waters will become highly corrosive to the shells and skeletons of aragonite-producing marine calcifiers like planktonic marine snails known as pteropods.\nAlthough ocean acidification has only recently emerged as a scientific issue, it has quickly raised serious concerns about the short-term impacts on marine organisms and the long-term health of the ocean. Scientists estimate that over the next few thousand years, 90 percent of anthropogenic CO2 emissions will be absorbed by the ocean. This may potentially affect biological and geochemical processes such as photosynthesis and nutrient cycling that are vital to marine ecosystems on which human society and many natural systems rely. At the same time, marine organisms will face the enormous challenge of adapting to ocean acidification, warming water, and declining subsurface-ocean oxygen concentrations.\nNews & Insights\nWHOI working to address ocean acidification; protect region’s vital shellfish industry\nA new report addresses the impacts of ocean acidification in Massachusetts and New England coastal waters on the region’s vital seafood industry.\nOcean acidification gets a watchful eye in New England aquaculture ‘hot spot’\nShellfish aquaculture is thriving in New England, but future growth in the industry could be stunted as coastal waters in the region become more acidic.

8	How does future warming affect monsoons and deserts differently?	While future warming may lead to above average monsoonal moisture, the extra moisture is likely to be counterbalanced by increased evaporative loss in desert regions. In humid regions, increases in precipitation may lead to increases in effective moisture, following a pattern where 'the poor get poorer while the rich get richer'.	"['(Phys.org) —New research by scientists at the University of New Mexico suggests that future warming may lead to above average monsoonal moisture. While that sounds like a ray of sunshine especially to farmers in arid regions, the extra moisture is likely to be counterbalanced by increased evaporative loss.\nIn a paper published today by Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) the scientists, including UNM\'s Yemane Asmerom and Victor Polyak, and Jessica Rasmussen, Leander (Texas) Independent School District; Stephen Burns, University of Massachusetts; and Matthew Lachinet, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, document extended drought and pluvial (wet) cycles over the past 1,500 years.\nTheir findings, in contrast to previously held views, suggest that colder than normal Northern Hemisphere temperatures and North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are correlated with this extended Northern Hemisphere monsoon drought episodes, while warmer than normal temperatures are correlated with wetter than usual climate.\nThey used annual band thickness and stable isotope speleothem data originating from Bat Cave, a room in New Mexico\'s Carlsbad Caverns. The ages were derived from counting annual layers and confirmed by radiometric dating using short-lived isotope daughters of uranium. In this study, similar to tree ring layers, increases in precipitation result in increases in growth thickness. The observations are further supported by the stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen data.\n""During the late Holocene, climate in western North America was highlighted by periods of extended aridity intervals called megadroughts,"" Asmerom, the lead author, said in the paper. ""The droughts, we have found, are linked to cool Northern Hemisphere temperatures and North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs).\n""During the past millennium several megadroughts were evident, including a multi-century drought, called a Super Drought, which lasted more than 300 years from 1350–1650. That time period also corresponds to the coldest period of the Little Ice Age. The coherent timing in changes in precipitation between southwestern North American, Chinese and West African monsoon suggests the megadroughts were hemispheric in scale.""\nThe scientists compared their records to records from cave formations from China that record changes in the Asian monsoon and lake sediments from west Africa, which records changes in the west African monsoon.\n""Our analysis shows that the summer monsoons in North America, Asia and North Africa were all behaving the same way during these large-scales climatic changes, including the extended drought during the early Little Ice Age,"" Asmerom said.\nThe past 1,500 years, including the Medieval Climate Anomaly and Little Ice Age, are of particular interest because this period contains significant natural climate variability before the large addition of green house gases from human burning of fossil fuels. These natural fluctuations in climate represent important points of validation for models of future climate change.\nAsmerom said that they looked at any possible external forcing to the observed changes in Northern Hemisphere temperature and North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST). There seems to be a statistically significant positive correlation between these observed temperature changes and changes in solar radiation. Droughts seem to be associated with solar minima, while increases in solar radiation correlate with warmer and wetter monsoons.\nAccording to Asmerom, the magnitude in the changes in solar insolation, at least in the visible spectrum is small. ""There are large changes in the upper atmosphere ultra-violet solar radiation budget, however, and may have influence in atmospheric circulation and sea surface temperatures,"" Asmerom said.\nAt shorter time-scales, the various monsoons don\'t act in unison. For example, decadal scale changes in North Atlantic SST, indexed by Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), have opposite effects on our (North American) monsoon and west African monsoon, including the drought-prone Sahel region of Africa.\nDuring warm (positive) phases of the AMO, similar to the current condition, summer monsoon rainfall in our region decreases from normal, while increases in west African monsoon are observed. While during the negative phase of the AMO, similar to conditions that prevailed during the 1970s to the 1990s, our monsoon moisture increases while the opposite happens in the Sahel region of Africa.\nThe hemispherical scale changes observed by Asmerom and co-investigators are of longer time-scales, imposed on the short-scale variability related to the AMO and even the shorter cycle El Niño-La Niña cycle (5–7 years).\nThe research is important in helping scientists develop past climate models and their associated atmospheric climate anomalies while building a unified global understanding of future climate change. Given future warming due to increases in greenhouse gases, for our region, any increases in moisture from increase in summer precipitation may be wiped out by increase in evaporation, while increases in precipitation in more humid regions may lead to increases in effective moisture. Some have referred to this scenario as ""the poor will get poorer while the rich will get richer.""\n""But, it could have been worse,"" said Asmerom. ""We could have had a worse scenario, by which warmer climate leads to diminished monsoon precipitation, as some have speculated previously. But that does not seem to be the case, based on our study.""\nExplore further: Natural climate swings contribute more to increased monsoon rainfall than global warming\nMultidecadal to multicentury scale collapses of Northern Hemisphere monsoons over the past millennium, www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1214870110', 'Properties, goods and services\nOne of the largest terrestrial biomes, deserts cover 27.7 Mkm2, comprising extra-polar regions with mean annual precipitation <250 mm and an unfavourable precipitation to potential evaporation ratio (Nicholson, 2002; Warner, 2004; Reid et al., 2005). Deserts support on the order of 10 people per km2, in sparse populations with among the lowest gross domestic product (GDP) of all ecoregions (Reid et al., 2005). Recent estimates suggest that between 10 and 20% of deserts and drylands are degraded due to an imbalance between demand for and supply of ecosystem services (Adeel et al., 2005). Critical provisioning goods and services include wild food sources, forage and rangeland grazing, fuel, building materials, and water for humans and livestock, for irrigation and for sanitation, and genetic resources, especially of arid-adapted species (Adeel et al., 2005; Hassan et al., 2005). Regulating services include air quality, atmosphere composition and climate regulation (Hassan et al., 2005), especially through wind-blown dust and desert albedo influences on regional rainfall, and biogeochemistry of remote terrestrial and marine ecosystems (Warner, 2004).\nThe TAR noted several vulnerabilities in drylands (Gitay et al., 2001, p. 239) but chiefly that human overuse and land degradation, exacerbated by an overall lack of infrastructure and investment in resource management, would be very likely to overwhelm climate change impacts, with the exception of impacts of increased dry and wet extremes due to ENSO frequency increase, and negative impacts of projected warming and drying in high biodiversity regions. On the other hand, evidence for region-specific increases in productivity and even community compositional change due to rising atmospheric CO2 was reported, with associated increased biomass and soil organic matter. Overall impacts of elevated CO2 were reported as comparable, though usually opposite in sign, to climate change projections. Since the TAR, further work shows that desert biodiversity is likely to be vulnerable to climate change (Reid et al., 2005), with winter-rainfall desert vegetation and plant and animal species especially vulnerable to drier and warmer conditions (Lenihan et al., 2003; Simmons et al., 2004; Musil et al., 2005; Malcolm et al., 2006), and continental deserts vulnerable to desiccation and even soil mobilisation, especially with human land-use pressures (Thomas and Leason, 2005). However, the potentially positive impact of rising atmospheric CO2 remains a significant uncertainty, especially because it is likely to increase plant productivity, particularly of C3 plants (Thuiller et al., 2006b) and, together with rainfall change, could even induce wildfires (Bachelet et al., 2001; Hardy, 2003; Duraiappah et al., 2005). The uncertain impact of elevated CO2 on vegetation productivity and biogeochemical cycling in deserts is an important source of contrasting projections of impacts and vulnerability for different desert regions and vegetation types. Climate change and direct human land-use pressure are likely to have synergistic impacts on desert ecosystems and species that may be offset, at least partly, by vegetation productivity and carbon sequestration gains due to rising atmospheric CO2. The net effect of these trends is very likely to be region-specific.\nDeserts are likely to experience more episodic climate events, and interannual variability may increase in future, though there is substantial disagreement between GCM projections and across different regions (Smith et al., 2000; Duraiappah et al., 2005). Continental deserts could experience more severe, persistent droughts (Lioubimtseva and Adams, 2004; Schwinning and Sala, 2004). Vulnerability to desertification will be enhanced due to the indicated increase in the incidence of severe drought globally (Burke et al., 2006). In the Americas, temperate deserts are projected to expand substantially under doubled CO2 climate scenarios (Lauenroth et al., 2004). However, dry-spell duration and warming trend effects on vegetation productivity may be at least partly offset by rising atmospheric CO2 effects on plants (Bachelet et al., 2001; Thuiller et al., 2006b), leading to sometimes contrasting projections for deserts that are based on different modelling techniques that either incorporate or ignore CO2-fertilisation effects.\nElevated CO2 has been projected to have significant potential impacts on plant growth and productivity in drylands (Lioubimtseva and Adams, 2004). This projection has been confirmed for cool desert shrub species (Hamerlynck et al., 2002), and both desert shrubs and invasive (but not indigenous) grasses in wet years only (Smith et al., 2000). On the whole, evidence for CO2-fertilisation effects in deserts is conflicting, and species-specific (Lioubimtseva and Adams, 2004; Morgan et al., 2004). In the south-western USA the total area covered by deserts may decline by up to 60% if CO2-fertilisation effects are realised (Bachelet et al., 2001). Limited direct impacts of atmospheric CO2 on nitrogen-fixation have been found in soil biological crusts (Billings et al., 2003), but soil microbial activity beneath shrubs has been observed to increase, thus reducing plant-available nitrogen (Billings et al., 2002).\nSoil vulnerability to climate change is indicated by shallow desert substrates with high soluble salts and the slow recolonisation of disturbed soil surfaces by different algae components (Evans and Belnap, 1999; Johansen, 2001; Duraiappah et al., 2005). Very low biomass (a drop below a 14% cover threshold) is very likely to make the Kalahari desert dune system in southern Africa susceptible to aeolian erosion (Thomas and Leason, 2005) and, with regional warming of between 2.5 and 3.5°C, most dune fields could be reactivated by 2100 (Thomas and Leason, 2005). Increased dust flux may increase aridity and suppress rainfall outside deserts, with opposite effects under wetting scenarios (Bachelet et al., 2001; Hardy, 2003; Prospero and Lamb, 2003; Lioubimtseva and Adams, 2004), leading to indirect effects on the vulnerability of remote regions to climate change. About one-third of the Sahel was projected to aridify with warming of 1.5 to 2°C by about 2050, with a general equatorward shift of vegetation zones (van den Born et al., 2004; Box 4.2). Alternative climate scenarios show less pronounced changes (van den Born et al., 2004).\nBox 4.2. Vegetation response to rainfall variability in the Sahel\nThe Sahel falls roughly between the 100-200 mm/year (northern boundary) and 400-600 mm/year rainfall isohyets (southern boundary), and supports dry savanna vegetation forming transition zones with the Sahara and humid tropical savanna (Nicholson, 2000; Hiernaux and Turner, 2002; Anyamba and Tucker, 2005). These transition zones have historically fluctuated in response to rainfall changes (Hiernaux and Turner, 2002), in the clearest example of multi-decadal variability measured during the past century (Hulme, 2001). Ecosystem responses to past rainfall variability in the Sahel are potentially useful as an analogue of future climate change impacts, in the light of projections that extreme drought-affected terrestrial areas will increase from 1% to about 30% globally by the 2090s (Burke et al., 2006).\nDuring the mid-Holocene, conditions supporting mesic vegetation and abundant wildlife deteriorated rapidly (ECF, 2004; Foley et al., 2003), highlighting the Sahel’s sensitivity to forcing effects. The Sahel has shown the largest negative trends in annual rainfall observed globally in the past century, though these reversed somewhat after the late 1970s (Trenberth et al., 2007). Since about 1900, multi-decadal-scale rainfall variability persisted, with drying trends between around 1930-1950 and 1960-1985 (Hulme, 2001; Nicholson, 2001). Conditions apparently improved between 1950 and 1960, with limited evidence suggesting increased human and livestock numbers (Reij et al., 2005). Severe drought prevailed in the early 1980s (Hulme, 2001; Trenberth et al., 2007), and groundwater levels declined, species-specific woody plant mortality increased (mainly of smaller plants), and even dominant perennial C4 grasses with high water-use efficiency declined. Exposed soil caused increased atmospheric dust loads (Nicholson, 2000, 2001). These events stimulated the concept of desertification and subsequent debates on its causes (Herrmann and Hutchinson, 2005).\nThe persistence of drought during the latter part of the 20th century prompted suggestions that land-cover change had exerted a positive feedback to reinforce drought conditions, but the modelled vegetation change necessary to induce this effect does not reflect reality (Hulme, 2001). During relatively wet periods (Nicholson et al., 2000; Anyamba and Tucker, 2005; Trenberth et al., 2007) spatially variable regeneration in both the herbaceous and the woody layer have been observed (Gonzalez, 2001; Rasmussen et al., 2001; Hiernaux and Turner, 2002). Remote sensing shows the resilience of Sahelian vegetation to drought, with no directional change in either desert transition zone position or vegetation cover (Nicholson et al., 1998). Sahel green-up between the years 1982 and 1998 (Prince et al., 1998; Hickler et al., 2005) and between 1994 and 2003 (Anyamba and Tucker, 2005) has been noted, but this interpretation has recently been challenged (Hein and Ridder, 2006).\nDrivers of Sahel vegetation change remain uncertain (Hutchinson et al., 2005), especially because the correlation between rainfall and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) appear weak, signalling that greening cannot be fully explained by increasing rainfall (Olsson et al., 2005), and greening may not comprise a return to the initial species composition, cover and surface soil conditions (Warren, 2005). Inconclusive interpretations of vegetation dynamics in the Sahel may reflect complex combined effects of human land use and climate variability on arid environments (Rasmussen et al., 2001). It is far from clear how the interactive effect of climate change, land-use activities and rising CO2 will influence the Sahel in future. Green-up, or desert amelioration (Figure 4.3, vegetation class 4) due to rising CO2 and enhanced water-use efficiency (as observed by Herrmann et al., 2005) may accrue only in wet years (Morgan et al., 2004).\nEpisodic wet periods may increase vulnerability to invasive alien species and subsequent fire outbreaks and this, combined with land overuse, will increase vulnerability to degradation and desertification (Dukes and Mooney, 1999; Dube and Pickup, 2001; Holmgren and Scheffer, 2001; Brooks et al., 2004; Geist and Lambin, 2004; Lioubimtseva and Adams, 2004). Wet spells with elevated humidity and warmer temperatures will increase the prevalence of plant diseases (Harvell et al., 2002).\nDesert biodiversity is likely to be vulnerable to climate change (Reid et al., 2005), especially in so-called ‘biodiversity hotspots’ (Myers et al., 2000). In the Succulent Karoo biome of South Africa, 2,800 plant species face potential extinction as bioclimatically suitable habitat is reduced by 80% with a global warming of 1.5-2.7°C above pre-industrial levels (see Table 4.1). Daytime in situ warming experiments suggest high vulnerability of endemic succulent (see Glossary) growth forms of the Succulent Karoo to high-end warming scenarios for 2100 (mean 5.5°C above current ambient temperatures), inducing appreciable mortality in some (but not all) succulent species tested within only a few months (Musil et al., 2005). Desert species that depend on rainfall events to initiate breeding, such as resident birds, and migratory birds whose routes cross deserts, will be severely affected (Dukes and Mooney, 1999; Hardy, 2003; Box 4.5). The Mountain Wheatear in South Africa was projected to lose 51% of its bioclimatic range by 2050 under an SRES A2 emissions scenario (Simmons et al., 2004). In contrast, desert reptile species could be favoured by warming, depending on rainfall scenario (Currie, 2001).']"	['<urn:uuid:14147ecd-a204-49e5-b9c8-21ab53c5e8e1>', '<urn:uuid:8185a6da-55ac-4e39-a7da-b7b5a7d7642a>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	9	51	2641
9	How do traditional craftsmanship and modern marine science combine?	Traditional craftsmanship involved specialized workers like master carpenter Shin Eung-soo leading 1,000 craftsmen using historical tools and methods for Namdaemun's restoration, while modern marine science uses UV-Vis spectrophotometry and geochemical analysis of coral cores to study ocean acidification and temperature changes over time.	['Tuesday, April 30th, 2013\nThe Namdaemun, or Great South Gate, a wooden pagoda-style gate built in 1398 to serve as the main southern entrance to the walled city of Seoul, will officially reopen on Saturday, May 4th, after five years of painstaking restoration following a devastating fire.\nOn 8:40 PM on Sunday, February 11th, 2008, a man climbed a ladder to the second floor of the gate, poured paint thinner on the floor and set it on fire with a disposable lighter. He quickly climbed back down and fled, leaving behind unused bottles of paint thinner, a backpack, disposable lighters and the ladder. Firefighters were on the scene promptly, but there was some confusion about whether the fire was still burning and the Cultural Heritage Administration had warned the crews to proceed with caution so as not to damage the ancient structure. When the conflagration blew up again, it was too large to put out immediately. By the end of the five hour battle to put out the blaze, the gate had collapsed and was a smoldering pile of wreckage.\nA suspect was apprehended the next day. A search of his home found a can of paint thinner and leather gloves used in the arson and he confessed immediately, pleading the public’s forgiveness. Apparently he destroyed this ancient and beautiful monument because he was mad at the government for ignoring a petition he filed complaining that property developers had not paid him proper compensation for land that had been expropriated to build an apartment complex. A four page screed on the topic was also found at his home by police.\nHe was 69 when he committed this crime, hardly an impetuous youth, and it wasn’t the first he set fire to a historical monument. He was convicted in April of 2006 for setting a fire that burned down part of UNESCO World Heritage site Changgyeong Palace in Seoul. In an example of justice gone very wrong indeed, he was given a suspended 18-month jail sentence and a fine of a few thousand dollars. He was convicted of the arson of Namdaemun in October of 2008. The law learned too late from its mistake, but at least this time he got 10 years in jail, none of them suspended. Let’s hope he’s too old to climb ladders when he gets out.\nThe destruction of the Namdaemun, officially named Sungnyemun, or The Gate of Exalted Ceremonies, was a devastating blow to the country. Seoul has lost a great many of its historic monuments to modernization, occupation and war. This ancient gate, one of four built along the walls protecting Seoul just six years after the city became the capital of the then-new Joseon Dynasty (1392 -1910), was the oldest wooden structure in the city. It was given the formal designation of National Treasure Number One in 1962 during a previous restoration to repair damage from the Korean War (1950-1953) and the Japanese Occupation (1910-1945). It was only opened to the public for the first time since the occupation in 2006.\nAs horrific as the devastation was, there was still a fair amount of recoverable material from the site, enough to support a restoration. Authorities thankfully had made detailed architectural plans 182 pages long of the gate before opening it to the public in 2006, so restorers had accurate measurements and construction details to go on. However, given the opportunity to start from scratch, the government decided to restore the gate to its original form, rebuilding walls destroyed by the Japanese during the occupation and using only traditional construction methods. Instead of the modern paint and tiles employed during the restoration of the 1960s, this restoration would use only hand-made roof tiles fired in traditional kilns and natural paints, which had to be imported from Japan because there are no traditional paint manufacturers left in Korea, for the dancheong, the gloriously colorful decorative painting. Carpenters and stonemasons would use no power tools. It was hammers and chisels all the way.\nBefore the first hammer could strike, historians spent two years researching how the gate had looked originally. Surviving workers from the 1961 restoration were consulted for their memories of what had been changed. Craftsmen worked painstakingly to salvage every last part of the burned structure. Bent nails were heated and straightened one at a time at a rate of 50 to 70 a day. One team identified and tagged each piece of burned wood using radio frequency identification to find whatever could be reused and to collect more information about how they had once been put together. They recovered an incredible total of more than 60,000 original wooden pieces to reuse during the restoration. The 68 stone animals on the roof were pieced back together from fragments.\nWhat could not be reused was recreated using materials as close to the original as possible. Pine wood from old growth trees, very rare in Korea today, was located so there would be time to fell the trees and cure them properly before using them. People flocked to donate pines from their property, so many that experts had their pick of the most noble pines left in the country. They ultimately chose 167 trees from 12 locations, including 20 trees from the Jungyeong Tomb in the city of Samcheok, the source of the pines used by the royal family during the Joseon Period. The total weight tally for the project was 26 tons of pinewood.\nThe roof tiles were almost obliterated by the fire, but 95% of them were factory-made versions installed during the 1961 restoration. All 23,369 of the new clay roof tiles were produced using traditional methods which result in a lighter weight, unique tile. This was no mean feat. According to traditional tile maker Han Hyung-joon of Jaewajang, who bears the outstanding title of Intangible Cultural Asset No. 91, there are only three kilns left in South Korea that produce traditional tiles. Making thousands and then shipping them to Seoul was tricky because the tiles can easily be cracked by temperature changes and damaged during transportation.\nMaster carpenter Shin Eung-soo (71) led the project, overseeing a team of 1,000 top woodworkers, stonemasons, blacksmiths and others craftsmen who had to work as their ancestors had. Even the tools themselves required research to find.\nLee Eui-sang, a 72-year-old mason who participated in the project, said the government’s plan to restore Sungnyemun in a traditional way perplexed him at first.\n“I didn’t know what to do because all the tools used by the nation’s traditional masons disappeared in the middle of 1970s,” he said. So, he had to travel around the country in search of old tools.\n“The past three years that I participated in the Sungnyemun restoration project were the most unforgettable experiences in my 55 years as a mason,” he said.\nThe project was initially estimated to take three years to complete at a cost of $21 million. It took five years and $24.4 million, which really is impressively close to the estimate considering the kind of detailed handcrafting that went into recreating the gate in all its glory.\nOn Saturday the gate will be reopened with a traditional cheondo ceremony to eliminate all bad luck and with a performance of traditional folk Korean folk song Arirang. The signboard on the front of the gate, repaired from surviving pieces of the old tablet with some new patching and now covered by a tarp, will be unveiled. Given the revival of traditional customs that this restoration has engendered, it’s eminently fitting that the reopening should feature the same ceremonies traditionally used to inaugurate new homes.', 'CEA research engineer Eric Douville recently spent 10 days aboard Tara, working in the laboratory and collecting samples at sea. Back at home base — the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences (LSCE) on the Paris-Saclay campus — Eric is studying the core samples of coral collected in the Pacific Ocean since the beginning of the expedition. Interview with a geochemist.\nCan you tell us more about your mission with Tara Pacific?\nIn collaboration with the Scientific Center of Monaco (MSC), I proposed to set up precise pH measurements of surface seawater from the schooner by installing on board a UV-Vis spectrophotometer with fiber optics. The pH is the key indicator of ocean acidification resulting from the ongoing absorption into the sea of carbon dioxide massively released into the atmosphere by human activities. We study this parameter to characterize and quantify the current acidification of water masses and better assess its impact on the life of corals.\nYou have received all the coral cores collected during Tara’s expeditions.\nI lead a research team at the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences (LSCE). We carry out work in both geochronology and geochemistry. In geochronology, we develop tools to precisely date climate records or archaeological remains. For example, certain techniques were used during an earlier expedition to date the deep fossil corals collected in the North Atlantic. Currently, we’re using these same tools to confirm the growth pattern of surface coral we sampled in the Pacific Ocean. In a second step, we will develop our work in geochemistry to establish and quantify the evolution over time (especially over the last 100 years) of the temperature and pH of the Pacific Ocean.\nCoral reefs studied by the scientists on board Tara © Eric Rottinger / Tara Expeditions Foundation\nWhat are the established protocols to study these growth models?\nThe first step, before studying the geochemistry of Tara’s coral samples, is to establish an age model, to understand how the drilled and studied colonies developed over time. There are 2 methods to establish the growth rate of coral colonies. The first is simply to track and count the annual density bands after core analysis by medical scanner or x-ray. Each year, the coral forms a particular density band linked to the succession of seasons. If necessary, to confirm the counting of tropical coral growth bands, we use dating methods based on the radioactive decay of certain isotopes.\nHave you started working on the cores taken by the Tara Pacific teams?\nOf the 20 or so cores recently received since the beginning of the expedition, we’ve begun the analysis of about 10 cores of the species Porites. We were able to establish the growth patterns of the concerned colonies while beginning the first geochemical analyses. The first cores taken in the eastern Pacific were a bit short and only covered the last 50 years, but in agreement with the Tara Pacific consortium, we decided to drill a new species of massive coral of the genus Diploastrea heliopora. Since then, we’ve received new cores taken from different sites in the western Pacific, enabling us today to cover the last 200 years or even beyond.\nGroup of polyps in a colony of Diploastrea helioporae © Noëlie Pansiot / Tara Expeditions Foundation\nWhat happens after the dating of the samples?\nAfter establishing the colony growth model, we analyze their geochemistry, in other words the chemical composition of the coral skeleton, which allows us to reconstruct the evolution of the ocean temperature and pH in the past.\nWhat information is provided by these Tara coral samples?\nIt’s too early to tell! But there’s one important thing to do: we have to compare the evolution of the ocean’s characteristics here in relation with the parameters of coral growth and physiology, in other words their capacity to develop and grow over time. This is to study the impact of ongoing global changes on the development of coral reefs in the Pacific. What does stand out from this research is that the major changes in pH and temperature since the beginning of the industrial era have already changed the rate of coral growth.\nToday, all our recordings systematically show a drop in the pH of the oceans over the last 150 years, which corresponds to the industrial era. We note that since the beginning of the industrial era, ocean acidification has accelerated at a rate never seen since 300 million years. And its impact on marine life, which will be more and more pressing in future years, remains unknown.\nOcean acidification and observations – ITW Alexander Venn\nThe oceans absorb a fourth of anthropic CO2 emissions released every day into ...Read more\nTara Oceans: discovery of over 100 million genes from the marine world\nPress release – January 25, 2018 The Tara Oceans expedition (2009-2013) ...Read more\nVideo: Studying coral adaptation to climate change\nA team of researchers from the Monaco Scientific Center, the University of Nice ...Read more']	['<urn:uuid:925ee305-bc49-452e-87f2-24319b1b76c5>', '<urn:uuid:5ef7139f-8893-493c-9980-0290bbddf700>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	9	43	2097
10	What steps should manufacturers take to determine if their pharmaceutical products can withstand the high temperatures involved in steam sterilization procedures?	Generally, pilot plant or bench top laboratory studies are conducted where the formulated product in the intended container/closure system is exposed to maximum anticipated thermal and time conditions. After thermal exposure, the drug product is tested to ensure it remains within specification limits. The thermally exposed products should also be placed on accelerated 40°C stability studies for at least three months.

At this point, one would have to speculate on what the maximum conditions of the sterilization process would be. Following thermal exposure per the maximum sterilization cycle conditions, the drug product is tested to ensure that the product remains within the specification limits.\nMore than one set of cycle parameters may be evaluated, such as variable times and temperature conditions, to determine whether a heat sensitive product is compatible with a terminal sterilization process. These evaluations could be classified as initial R&D stability studies. Further, thermally exposed products should be placed on accelerated 40°C stability studies for at least three months. If the product stability data demonstrate that the initial product specification release limits cannot be maintained, a case exists for aseptically processing the product. These data would have to be included in the NDA or European regulatory submission.\nDuring the review process, questions may arise regarding whether extractables from the container/closure system influenced the drug or product data.

11	What's the difference between conventional wastewater treatment plants and MBR Mitsubishi technology when it comes to handling toxic materials and bacteria filtration?	MBR Mitsubishi technology is superior at handling toxic materials and bacteria due to its 0.4 micrometre filtration holes, which prevent bacteria from escaping even when toxic substances disrupt flake formation. In conventional plants, toxic materials can cause nitrifying bacteria to stop producing settleable flakes, allowing them to flow out of the system. This makes MBR particularly effective for treating industrial wastewaters and removing substances like pharmaceutical residues.	"['This technical guide explains what biological wastewater treatment is, how it works, and how it’s used to improve the quality of industrial waste water streams prior to discharge. The guide looks at the main types of treatment including aerobic, anaerobic and anoxic; the importance of Biological Oxygen Demand or BOD, and the different types of waste water treatment technologies currently including various types of bioreactor.\nWhy should you treat wastewater?\nAny company producing industrial waste typically has to incorporate some sort of wastewater treatment system to ensure compliance with their local environmental and waste discharge regulations.\nThe ideal wastewater treatment system will take into account the potential for environmental harm, the health of staff and the general public, the process or products which the facility is making or processing, and both upfront capital and ongoing operating costs.\nThinking about treating waste products before discharging any wastewater into the local drainage system will also keep operations on the right side of the law, and avoid the hefty fines often associated with breaching environmental legislation.\nBiological wastewater treatment\nBiological wastewater treatment is usually the second stage in the cleaning process and comes after larger particles have been removed through the filtering or settlement stages.\nBiological wastewater treatment is an effective way of breaking down and eliminating organic waste, typical of the waste products produced in the food and drink, chemical, oil and gas industries.\nBiological treatment is complex and has many different aspects to it.\nRead on for a brief run-through of the most common methods of biological wastewater treatment methods.\nWhat is biological wastewater treatment?\nThe simple version of the answer to this is that a typical biological wastewater treatment system uses bacteria and other microbes to clean contaminated water so that it passes predetermined standards.\nThe bacteria used in the processes uses the pollutants found in the wastewater as food.\nAs it consumes the pollutants it begins to create particles which start to stick together to create larger clumps.\nThis process allows the organic matter to eventually settle out of the wastewater solution, producing a sludge which can be easily disposed of as a solid waste.\nTypes of biological treatment\nThere are three main types of biological wastewater treatment:\nBiological Oxygen Demand\nBiological Oxygen Demand, or BOD, is the name of the measurement used to quantify the amount of dissolved oxygen needed by the anaerobic bacteria in the system to break down organic matter.\nA high level of BOD means that there is a high level of biodegradable material in the water.\nThis can be caused by several things including industrial discharge pollutants, domestic sewage, or run-off from fertilisers.\nIf pollutant levels are very high, BOD can also remove the oxygen required by other aquatic lifeforms.\nThis can cause the death of fish and other aquatic life, accelerate the growth of blooms of harmful algae and result in serious damage to the ecosystem in the area where the untreated or poorly treated wastewater is discharged.\nThis potential for environmental damage is what drives the requirements to treat waste before final discharge.\nSelecting the best wastewater treatment system\nThe type of wastewater produced by your operation, coupled with the discharge requirements in your particular area will determine which type of biological treatment is needed, and in which order the treatments should be sequenced.\nBiological treatment systems therefore take an existing biological process, and optimise this to make it easier to remove contamination in industrial wastewater.\nThe best systems can replace, or be used alongside, other physical and chemical wastewater treatment processes.\nMicroorganisms and wastewater\nThe exact composition of a biological wastewater treatment system will depend on the chemical composition of the raw wastewater and might be made up several different steps.\nThe system will also include procedures which can keep biomass growth in check.\nFor example, engineers will often keep an eye on and adjust aeration to keep dissolved oxygen levels constant and at the correct rates to keep the system running efficiently.\nAs well as monitoring dissolved oxygen levels, operators have to balance other aspects of the system such as nutrients, temperature, flow and pH levels.\nTrying to balance a wide range of factors in a biological treatment process can become very complex, very quickly.\nThere are several key technologies in used in the treatment of wastewater and these are explored below.\nAerobic wastewater treatment technologies\nCommon types of aerobic treatment technologies.\nActivated sludge is a system that has been around since the start of the 20th century.\nIt’s the most common biological treatment used in large utility type water treatment plants but also has a place in other industrial settings.\nWastewater first flows into an aeration tank, where oxygen is pumped into the water to feed the freely-floating bacteria and other microorganisms.\nThese then break the organic material down to form biological solids which form clumps known as flocs.\nFlocs can then be removed from the wastewater through the sedimentation process.\nThe disadvantage of activated sludge processes is that they require a lot of space, and can produce large amounts of sludge.\nOn the plus side, they are cheap to build and maintain when compared with other options.\nFixed-bed bioreactors (FBBRs)\nFixed-bed bioreactors or FBBRs are a technology that was developed in the 1970s and 80s.\nFBBRs comprise a series of tanks with multiple chambers, packed with a porous material such as ceramic, foam or plastic.\nThe wastewater flows through the various chambers, with contaminants being eaten by microbes along the way.\nThe design of the chambers and porous material allows FBBRs to hold more microbes in the same space, making this a space-saving technology when compared with other options.\nIt’s also energy efficient, and ideal for treating wastewater at all BOD levels.\nSludge disposal costs are low and FBBRs have a long lifespan too.\nWater can flow through the system without plugging or channeling.\nThere’s also the option to add other biological processes such as nitrification or desalination into the chambers, and the set-up of the system can be tailored for your specific requirements.\nMoving-bed bioreactors or MBBRs are a Norwegian invention which came into use in the late 1980s.\nThis technology is now being used in many countries for treating both domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater.\nA typical MBBR set-up comprises aeration tanks filled with small biofilm carriers of different shapes and sizes.\nAs the biofilm carriers are MBBRs are suspended and moving, this allows high BOD wastewater to be treated in a smaller area.\nThere’s usually a second stage in the process after a MBBR is used.\nExcess sludge settles into a slurry which can be removed by vacuum, or solids can be pressed into solids for removal and disposal.\nMBBRs are typically used in the first step of the treatment process, or used in situations where the quality of the effluent is of lesser importance.\nMBBRs are typically used to treat wastewater from food and drink factories, meat processing or packing plants, oil refineries or petrochemical sites.\nMembrane bioreactors (MBRs)\nMembrane bioreactors or MBRs were developed in the 1990s.\nMembrane modules are submerged into the aeration tank, and air is used to scour the submerged membrane to keep them clear.\nThis is an advanced treatment method which combines conventional activated sludge and membrane filtering to remove solids rather than depending on sedimentation.\nMBRs produce a higher quality of effluent when compared with conventional activated sludge plants, and take up far less space.\nThe design of the system will depend on the type of wastewater produced and what type of end result is required.\nA typical MBR will have both aerobic and anaerobic treatment tanks, a system for aeration, a tank with a membrane, and an ultrafiltration membrane.\nAlthough effective, the downside of a MBR system is that it is expensive to build initially, and also involves higher operating and maintenance costs.\nBiological trickling filters\nBiological trickling filters can be used to remove organic contamination from either wastewater or air.\nThe air or water is passed through some type of medium which will allow biofilm to collect on its surface.\nThis biofilm, composed of both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria, will break down organic contamination.\nGravel, foam, sand or ceramics might be used to create these systems.\nThese filters are more commonly found in water treatment plants but can be very effective in any situation where keeping smells to a minimum is essential.\nAnaerobic wastewater treatment technologies\nWith up-flow anaerobic sludge blankets, or UASBs, the theory is that wastewater enters at the base of the system and up through a blanket of sludge before into a upper gas separator, where biogas is sucked away.\nSuspended solids settle and return to the lower levels of the system, as cleaned effluent flows away from the top.\nThe biogas, a mix of methane and carbon dioxide, is burned off, or can be used to generate electricity for using elsewhere in the plant.\nUASB creates less sludge than an aerobic system, requiring less frequent cleaning and emptying of sludge.\nHowever, maintaining this type of plant is skilled work and experienced engineers must keep on top of conditions to ensure it works properly.\nAnaerobic digesters can break down organic waste without the need for oxygen.\nThis process is most commonly used in sewage treatment, and frequently found digesters include covered lagoons, suspended or submerged media, stirred tank reactors and

Mitsubishi\nGeneral advantages of Mitsubishi membrane separation:\n• Concentration of sediment in the activation is up to 15 kg/m3, this allows to reduce technological volumes of biological WWTP for about 70% compared with the traditional WWTP. This greatly reduces the area of land used for construction – about 50%.\n• Treated water is filtrated – content NL = 0.\n• A size of filtration holes is 0,4 micro metre. This ensures filtration of size of bacteria. Therefore, even if there is a decomposition of flakes by action of for instance toxic matters (heavy metals, ect.) contained in flowing waste water, bacteria can not drain from the system as it is with conventional WWTP. In the conventional WWTP is common that if something acts toxic on nitrifying bacteria, these bacteria do not produce sufficient flakes able to settle and are therefore no caught by sedimentation in settlement tank and flow out of the system. This is especially true for a long time growing bacteria which is necessary to sustain in the system for biologically difficult decomposed substances. For example an effectiveness of MBR WWTP on biological decomposition of drugs is many time higher that in conventional wastewater treatment plants. This is the basic difference in quality between the conventional activated WWTP and membrane WWTP. This technological effect has an importance especially in industrial wastewaters. Many industrial wastewaters, which are not biologically cleanable by conventional technology with separation of sediment by sedimentation, can be very well biologically treated with use of MBR Mitsubishi technology.\nMitsubishi membranes have been long proven in the toughest industrial environments. For urban waste water is the quality of purified water (except NL) on the level of about 30 % of classic technology with the same chemical-technological parameters of activation.\n• Especially very convenient technology for biological phosphorus removal –incomparably greater efficiency and hassle-free technology of entire biological WWTP.\n• System is also advantageous for the intensification of the existing WWTP due to the fact that on the same land and construction part can be increased substance performance of WWTP at 200 to 300 %.\n• Operation is fully automatic and therefore an operator does not need to understand the process of biological treatment. This has the advantage mainly for small WWTP in ownership and operation of communities of less then 4000 PE (population equivalent).\n• The whole technological device is commonly used (domestic) – only membrane modules are Japanese.\n• Lifetime of membranes in municipal wastewater treatment plants is estimated (based on over 40 years of operating experiences) for about 15 to 20 years. Because municipal wastewater treatment plants in Slovakia are dimensioned to Q max daily, and therefore, there is a big reserve in a hydraulic system compared to actual total annual flow through a WWTP.\n• The costs of a membrane replacement (stainless steel construction of module remains) are with lifespan of 15 years and sewer rate of 0,6 € per 1 m3 of treated water approx. 4 % of this sewer rate.\n• Occasional chemical treatment runs while WWTP is in operation and takes up to 2 hours.\n• Warranty on membranes is 5 years.\n• Very advantageous also for a singular sewer system – with an inflow from the rain, the substantial amount of waste water runs through conventional line with feeding tanks, but with normal sewage (rainless) inflow, the substantial part of sewage water runs through MBR Mitsubishi and therefore especially in dry seasons – ecologically the most serious – the MBR Mitsubishi technology radically ensures an extreme quality of treated water.\n• Significantly lower total capital costs of sewerage system:\n- The size of less than 1500 PE, the costs for MBR Mitsubishi are higher than in conventional continuous technology.\n- For size of 1500 to 2000 PE are the costs about the same.\n- For WWTP the size of approx. 5000 PE are costs for MBR Mitsubishi lower by about 10-20%.\n- For WWTP the size of approx.15 000 PE are costs for MBR Mitsubishi lower by about 15-25%.\n- For WWTP the size of 100 000 PE are costs for MBR Mitsubishi lower by about 20-40%.\n- For WWTP the size of 500 000 PE are costs for MBR Mitsubishi lower by about 30-50%.\nDisadvantages of the MBR Mitsubishi:\nLike any other technology (and all human) has the MBR Mitsubishi apart from the advantages also some disadvantages. The MBR Mitsubishi disadvantages compared to conventional technology are.\n- The electricity consumption is about 15 % higher\n- Chemical cleaning of membranes is necessary and the costs of sodium hypochlorite (or citric acid) for chemical cleaning of any size of WWTP are approx. 0.04 Euro (max. 0.06 Euro) for 1 PE per year.\n- Longer lasting fatal operating error (weeks or months), or rather said “sabotage” may damage the membranes in the way that they will need to be replaced prematurely. Therefore, to avoid this, our company via the internet on daily basis checks the operation of the WWTP free of charge during the warranty period of 5 years. In the case of interest, after warranty period, we are able to monitor the operation of the particular WWTP on daily or weekly basis.\nIn fact, monitoring of all the technological parameters of the MBR Mitsubishi is for an average proficient worker of M + R and RS simple.\n- Substantially higher capital costs for technological devices, and therefore, the total instalments (price of construction and technological device) are higher.\n- Higher costs for elaboration of project documentation.\nThe largest WWTP with this technology is for the part of Beijing in China at capacity of 1 000 000 PE (1 million PE). The second largest WWTP is for the part of Singapore city at capacity 68 000 m3/per day. South Korea, which in a long term half operating and operating in full capacity monitored various membrane systems, decided that only for Mitsubishi membranes, this Korean state, provides grants on a nationwide program for rebuilding the conventional WWTP to the membrane WWTP. It is also certain indication of quality of these Japanese membranes.\nThe EU begins construction of a WWTP at capacity approx.150 000 PE and the flow of approx. 18 000 m3/per day for the city of Tilburg in the Netherlands. It is a mixture of sewage and industrial waste waters. As the construction is financed by private investors the only criterion of tender was total costs for realization of this WWTP plus the cost for 10 years operation. The winner of this tender for this WWTP will be operation for 10 years. The German companies which offered the conventional technologies together with anaerobic stabilization of excess sediment and with use of biogas were “dramatically” more expensive. The MBR Mitsubishi technology was significantly the cheapest! It is obvious that illogical EU subsidies significantly distort the market! Not only with the municipal waste water treatment plants. We do not believe that in Beijing, Singapore, Japan or South Korea would be build WWTP with MBR Mitsubishi technology, if such technology does not have significant, particularly economic advantages compared to conventional technologies.\nIn the present day it is estimated that the number of WTTP with MBR Mitsubishi technology is approx. 4000. Mitsubishi declares of itself that it is the world's largest manufacturer of membrane modules to the total flow capacity. The total performance capacity of MBR Mitsubishi also in time of crisis increases exponentially. It is quite possible that this increase in capacity of MBR Mitsubishi is not despite of the economic crisis but because of this crisis….ha, ha.\nIn France, it has been shown that some species of fish in the rivers started to significantly fast change gender. It has been found that it is only because in the rivers were found contraceptive agents that are used by women to prevent pregnancy. Residual concentrations of biologically active substances can the MBR technology eliminate significantly (several times) and more effectively than the conventional technologies. The substantial negative effect of commonly used medications in wastewaters has been conclusively demonstrated in the EU. The problem is so critical that a serious health effect on population in the western EU has been unambiguously demonstrated. Therefore, in the near future, the EU is preparing fundamental changes in legislation in this important matter. Simply, do not construct a WWTP with the technology of 20th century, but implement the technology of 21th century even with disadvantages that this technology has. Health of our children and our grandchildren is after all more important than saving 10 to 15 % on electricity consumption??!!\nIn the present time, until February 1, 2013, in the Slovak republic, in the town of Hurbanovo is operating already approx. for 10 months the municipal WWTP with the MBR Mitsubishi technology on flow of waste water through membrane line of approx. 2300 m3/per day. Based on current operating experiences, within this WTTP, it is estimates that the chemical lifespan of Mitsubishi membranes will be certainly over 20 years\nWe would be pleased to arrange a visit – tour- of the WTTP Hurbanovo in Slovakia for a serious investor who will prepare a new WTTP or enhance capacity of existing municipal WTTP of a capacity more that 1 000 m3/per day.\nWe provide a warranty of 5 years on the Mitsubishi membranes.\nAt the end of the year of 2012, the company ALVEST MONT s.r.o., with the MBR Mitsubishi technology, won the international tender for the implementation of the municipal WWTP for the part of the city of St. Petersburg in Russia for the capacity approx. 80 000 inhabitants. The private investor of this construction had to make a decision, and therefore, this investor had viewed more than 20 wastewater treatment plants in the western EU as well as in Czech and Slovak republic. After visiting the WWTP Hurbanovo, the investor had decided, “easily” and unambiguously, for this Japanese technology.\nIn no way is a conventional technology unpromising! No! The conventional technology had and will have permanently its advantages.\nBut in addition to the above, the MBR Mitsubishi technologies have also a great potential with relatively minimal capital and operating costs to significantly improve the quality of treated water at critical stages (dry summer seasons) and thereby substantially improve the long term environment.\nWe look forward to possible future cooperation.\n›››Contajner list Mitsubishi\nLeaflets for downloading (PDF)\n> Membrane biological reactors\nBiological treatment of industrial wastewater\nMitsubishi membrane module""]"	['<urn:uuid:25cfed4f-1589-4d73-8d2d-53d24e810b22>', '<urn:uuid:5ce21cbd-2fca-4086-9c56-62052c72ecf2>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	22	67	3447
12	What role did political power play in historical analysis and civilization studies?	Political power was viewed as the principal agent in history, with focus placed on deeds of kings and leaders while largely ignoring economic and social forces. This approach was evident in studies of civilizations' rise and decline, which analyzed how moral and religious challenges affected political robustness. Historical patterns showed cycles of growth, dissolution, universal state formation, and collapse, though some historians believed these cycles could be broken. The analysis of political power extended to examining great power rivalry and state-citizen relationships, though this emphasis on political history sometimes came at the expense of broader societal forces.	"['Study of History\nArnold Joseph Toynbee (April 14, 1889 - October 22, 1975), British historian\nwhose twelve-volume analysis of the rise and fall of civilizations, A Study of\nHistory, 1934 - 1961, (also known as History of the World) was very popular in its time.\nToynbee, a prolific author, was the nephew of a great economic historian, Arnold\nToynbee, with whom he is sometimes confused. Born in London, Arnold J was educated\nat Winchester College and Balliol College, Oxford. He worked for the Foreign Office\nduring both World War I and World War II. He was Director of Studies at the Royal\nInstitute of International Affairs (1925-1955) and Research Professor of International\nHistory at the University of London.\nToynbee was interested in the seeming\nrepetition of patterns in history and, later, in the origins of civilisation.\nIt was in this context that he read Spengler’s Decline of the West and although\nthere is some superficial similarity, both men describe the rise, flowering\nand decline of civilisations, their work moved in different directions.\nToynbee agreed with Spengler that there were strong parallels between their\nsituation in Europe and the ancient Greco-Roman civilization. Toynbee saw his own\nviews as being\nmore scientific and empirical than Spengler\'s, he described himself as a\n""metahistorian"" whose ""intelligible field of study"" was civilization.\nIn his Study of History Toynbee\ndescribes the rise and decline of 23 civilisations. His over-arching analysis\nwas the place of moral and religious challenge, and response to such challenge, as the\nreason for the\nrobustness or decline of a civilisation. He described parallel life cycles of growth,\ndissolution, a ""time of troubles,"" a universal state, and a final collapse leading\nto a new genesis. Although he found the uniformity of the patterns, particularly\nof disintegration, sufficiently regular to reduce to graphs, and even though he\nformulated definite laws of development such as ""challenge and response,""\nToynbee insisted that the cyclical pattern could, and should, be broken.\nToynbee’s books, huge in scale,\nachieved wide prominence but he was more admired by the History reading\npublic than by fellow historians, who criticised him for contorting\ninformation to fit his alleged patterns of history.\nThe ideas he promoted had some vogue (Toynbee actually appeared on the Cover\nof Time magazine in 1947). They have not however proved to be\nof decisive influence on other historians. Toynbee\'s work was subject to an effective\ncritique by Pieter Geyl and an article written by Hugh Trevor-Roper, ""Arnold\nToynbee\'s Millenium"" - descibing Toynbee\'s work as a ""Philosophy of Mish-Mash"" -\ndramatically undermined Toynbee\'s reputation.\nPopular European History pages\nThe preparation of these pages was influenced to some degree by a particular ""Philosophy\nof History"" as suggested by this quote from the famous Essay ""History"" by Ralph Waldo Emerson:-\nThere is one mind common to all individual men...\nOf the works of this mind history is the record.

The present\nattempt does not yield to that high office. It will merely tell\nhow it really was.""\nThe son of an attorney, and a scion of an old Luther\ntheological family, Leopold von Ranke was born in Wiehe,\nThuringia, in December 1795 and later became a famous German\nhistorian and educator. Thuringia was then part of the Kingdom of\nSaxony but was awarded to Prussia by the peace terms of 1815 at\nthe close of the Napoleonic wars.\nRanke attended the famous Pforta private school and, after\nfurther study at the Universities of Leipzig and Halle, he worked\nas a schoolmaster teaching Greek and Roman classics at the\nGymnasium in Frankfort-on-the-oder; this post being one held\nwithin the Prussian system. It was only whilst employed as a\nschoolmaster at Frankfurt that he began to consider attempting to\nbecome seriously involved in historical studies initially with\nthe view to improving his knowledge of the classical ages in\norder to be a better teacher.\nHis first book, History of the Latin and Teutonic Nations,\n1494-1514 (1824) written at Frankfort, included an appended\nsection entitled Zur Kritik neuerer Geschictschreiber\n(critique of modern historical writing) that presented a\nconvincing criticism of contemporary historiography condemning\nits reliance on tradition and proposed, instead, Ranke\'s own more\nobjective method. Ranke\'s aim was to reconstruct the unique\nperiods of the past as they actually were and to avoid injecting\nthe history of former times with the spirit of the present; this\napproach to historiography is known as historicism.\nRanke intended that his method would be applicable to modern\nhistory - Barthold Niebuhr had already pioneered a scientific\nmethod of historical investigation to be applied to ancient\nhistory. As a student Ranke had studied, and been greatly\nimpressed by Niebuhr\'s Roman History - he acknowledged a\ndebt to Niebuhr whose approach had been a source of backround\nRanke distrusted historical textbooks and turned, at every\nconvenient opportunity, to the study of more original sources.\nThis method Ranke later developed to feature a primarily reliance\non the ""narratives of eye-witnesses and the most genuine\nimmediate documents."" He considered that ""the strict presentation\nof the facts, contingent and unattractive though they may be, is\nundoubtedly the supreme law.""\nRanke\'s Zur Kritik neuerer Geschictschreiber was\nfavourably noticed by the Prussian minister of education and, in\n1825, he was rewarded with a supernumerary professorship at the\nUniversity of Berlin that initiated what were to become more than\nfifty years of association between Ranke and that\nThis appointment brought with it opportunities of access to\nthe Prussian royal library.\nFurther studies resulted in Ranke\'s second book on the\nOttomans and the Spanish monarchy and the quality of this work\ninvited the continued favour of the Prussian authority which\nagreed to facilitate Ranke\'s studies being further undertaken in\narchives in Vienna. From these times (1827) Ranke was enabled, by\nthe support of Gentz, to gain the protection of the powerful\nAustrian minister Metternich and this was to allow him very wide\naccess to archived materials and thereby to gain very valuable\ninformation from Venetian and other sources located in\nBetween 1828-31 Ranke pursued his lonely, sincere, and\npath-breaking studies, in the Italian peninsula where\nMetternich\'s influence had the power to open every door except\nthose in the Vatican.\nMost of these archived sources had not been seriously accessed\nby any historical scholar in the past and Ranke\'s researches in\nVienna and the Italian peninsula provided the material for some\nof the most respected historical writing of the age.\nThe Prussian authority sought to employ Ranke\'s talents, for a\ntime, in the editorship of the\nHistorische-Politische-Zeitschrift, a periodical that was\nintended to help to defend the Prussian Government against the\nrising tide of liberal and democratic opinion. In this role,\nwhich lasted some four years, Ranke produced some of the best\npolitical thought that had appeared in the Germanies for a long\ntime. Two famous essays The Great Powers, which surveys\ngreat power rivalry, and A Political Conversation, which\ntreats with the nature of the state and its relationship with the\ncitizen, date from this period.\nA talent for historical and political scholarship proved,\nhowever, to be somewhat ill matched to the intended task of\nimpairing the effectiveness of the expression of democratic\nRanke was thus able to return to historical study and\nHis subsequent works cover the histories of the major European\ncountries and include the History of the Popes During the 16th\nand 17th Centuries (1834-36), History of the Reformation in\nGermany (1839-47), Civil Wars and Monarchy in France in the 16th\nand 17th Centuries (1852).\nHe was awarded the security, and much enhanced salary, of a\nfull professorship in Berlin in 1837 and was appointed as\nPrussian historiographer by King Frederick William IV in\nHe died in May, 1886 at the age of 91; the last ten years of\nhis life having been given over to a Weltgeschichte\n(universal history) that Ranke had been able to bring, over nine\nvolumes, to the end of the 15th century at the time of\nAs a historian, Ranke attempted to put aside prevailing\ntheories and prejudices and by the scrupulous use of primary\nsources to present an unvarnished picture of the facts.\nNevertheless, because he viewed political power as the principal\nagent in history he tended to emphasize political history,\ndwelling upon the deeds of kings and leaders and ignoring\neconomic and social forces.\nA famous educator, he introduced the seminar as a method of\nteaching history and trained a generation of influential\nscholars. Since Ranke\'s time the seminar method of teaching\nhistory has become very widely adopted.\nAt the time of his death Ranke was regarded as the foremost\nhistorian in the world. Ranke\'s method of historicism has largely\npioneered the modern insistence on rigorously analyzing firsthand\ndocumentation. He has variously been described as ""The greatest\nGerman historian"", ""The father of the objective writing of\nhistory"", and ""The founder of the science of history.""\nRanke does occasionally adopt a literary approach in his\nwriting of history that tends to build up to a presentation of\nhistorical climaxes and also to build up certain historical\nfigures whose contributions are deemed to be particularly\nsignificant. This adds to the readability and the drama of\nRanke\'s works but it may not be strictly true that such literary\neffectiveness is fully in line with history ""as it had really\nRanke aimed at an universal or world view of history, but his\nbasic mood was nationalistic and conservative, accepting of\nmonarchy and sincerely religious, the massive changes after the\nFrench Revolution are hardly discussed. Ranke seems to have seen\nthe role of liberalism as being perhaps confined to the calling\nof the attention of statesmen to wrongs that needed\nHis books on Prussian history contained, with no intention for\nit to be used for propaganda purposes, the seeds for a Prussian\nnational German picture of history. This legacy compels one to\ncritical reflection, but at the same time it points to a\nflourishing time in historical research at the Berlin University,\nstarted by Ranke, which above all Max Lenz and Friedrich Meinecke\nwere able to continue.\n""From the particular, one can carefully and boldly move up\nto the general; from general theories, there is no way of looking\nat the particular.""\nPopular European History pages\nThe preparation of these pages was influenced to some degree by a particular ""Philosophy\nof History"" as suggested by this quote from the famous Essay ""History"" by Ralph Waldo Emerson:-\nThere is one mind common to all individual men...\nOf the works of this mind history is the record.

13	management practices forest ecosystem protection monitoring	Multiple management practices are employed to protect forest ecosystems. Best Management Practices and monitoring systems are implemented to assess environmental impacts and maintain ecosystem health. This includes regular monitoring through Forest Level Management Indicator Assemblage reports, which track habitat status and trends at the National Forest scale. The management approach also involves protecting water resources, as watersheds show that runoff patterns are influenced by landscape metrics and land use changes. Specific strategies include implementing riparian buffers, preserving open spaces, and restricting urban development in critical areas. These practices are regularly evaluated through monitoring and evaluation reports to ensure their effectiveness in protecting both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

Finn\nEcohydrology, Hydrograph, Land use, Watershed\nEnvironmental Sciences | Hydrology | Other Environmental Sciences\nMaintaining flows and quality of water resources is critical to support ecosystem services and consumptive needs. Understanding impacts of changes in climate and land use on ecohydrologic processes in a watershed is vital to sustaining water resources for multiple uses. This study completes a continental and regional scale assessment using statistical and simulation modeling to investigate ecohydrologic impacts within watershed systems.\nWatersheds across the continental United States have diverse hydrogeomorphic characters, mean temperatures, soil moistures, precipitation and evaporation patterns that influence runoff processes. Changes in climate affect runoff by impacting available soil moisture, evaporation, precipitation and vegetative patterns. A one percent increase in annual soil moisture may cause a five percent increase in runoff in watersheds across the continent. Low soil moisture and high temperatures influence runoff patterns in specific regions. Spring runoff is increased by the influence Spring soil moisture, Winter and Spring evaporation, and Winter and Spring evaporation. Spring runoff is decreased by increases in Winter and Spring temperatures and increases in the vegetation index. Winter runoff is affected by maximum vegetative index, temperature, soil moisture, evaporation and precipitation. Contributing factors to runoff are influenced by geomorphic and seasonal variations requiring strategies that are site-specific and use system-wide information.\nRegional scale watershed analysis investigates the influence of landscape metrics on temporal streamflow processes in multiple gauged watersheds in Massachusetts, U.S.A. Time of concentration, recession coefficient, base flow index, and peak flow are hydrologic metrics used to relate to landscape metrics derived using FRAGSTAT software. Peak flow increases with increasing perimeter-area fractal dimensions, and Contagion index and decreases as Landscape Shape Index increases. There was an increasing trend in the fractal dimension over time indicative of more complex shape of patches in watershed. Base flow index and recession coefficient fluctuated from low to high decreasing recently. This could be indicative of open space legislation, conservation efforts and reforestation within the state in the last ten years.\nCoastal systems provide valuable ecosystem services and are vulnerable to impacts of changes in climate and continental land use patterns. Effects of land use and climate change on runoff, suspended sediments, total nitrogen and total phosphorus are simulated for coastal watersheds around the Boston Bay ecosystem. The SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model, a continuous-time, semi distributed, process-based model, is used to simulate the watershed ecohydrologic process affecting coastal bodies. Urbanization in watersheds increased runoff by as much as 80% from the baseline. Land use change poses a major threat to water quality impacts affecting coastal ecosystems. Total nitrogen increased average of 53.8% with conservative changes in climate and land use. Total phosphorus increased an average of 57.3% with conservative changes in land use and climate change. Climate change alone causes up to 40% increase in runoff and when combined with a 3.25% increase in urban development runoff increased an average of 114%. Coastal ecosystems are impacted by nutrient runoff from watersheds. Continued urbanization and changes in climate will increase total nitrogen, total phosphorus and suspended sediments in coastal ecosystems.\nContinental scale runoff is affected by soil moisture and vegetative cover. Cover crops, low tillage farm practices and natural vegetation contribute to less runoff. Developing policies that encourage protection of soil structure could minimize runoff and aid in maintaining sustainable water resources. Best Management Practices and Low impact development at the national level with continued stormwater legislation directed towards sustainable land use policy will improve water quantity and quality. Fragmentation observed in Massachusetts increases the number of urban parcels and decreases the size of forested areas. Faster runoff patterns are observed but recent land management may be changing this runoff pattern. Municipal and state zoning ordinance to preserve open space and large forest patches will restrict urban growth to specific regions of a watershed. This could improve quantities of water available to ecosystems. Increases in total nitrogen, phosphorus and suspended sediments to coastal ecosystems can be minimized with use of riparian buffers and Best Management Practices within coastal watersheds. Urbanization and climate change threatens coastal ecosystems and national policy to preserve and restrict development of coastal areas will preserve coastal ecosystem services.\nEkness, Paul A., ""Ecohydrologic Impacts of Climate and Land Use Changes on Watershed Systems: A Multi-Scale Assessment for Policy"" (2013).

The northern spotted owl inhabits Oregon, Washington, and northern California; all national forests and BLM units within this range are managed to meet Northwest Forest Plan direction. The management of these public lands must meet dual needs: the need for forest habitat and the need for forest products. The NWFP also dictated adoption of complementary approaches by other Federal agencies, such as the National Park Service, within the owl’s range. Access the NWFP fact sheet.\nApart from the conservation direction for the northern spotted owl, the NWFP also created other important conservation guidelines for aquatic systems and old-growth associated species. These are called:\nForest Wide Late Successional Reserve (LSR) Assessment - August 26, 1999\nThe Record of Decision on Management of Habitat for Late-Successional and Old-growth Forest Related Species Within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl (ROD) established a network of Late Successional Reserves (LSRs), accompanied this by a set of management standards and guidelines. The network of reserves are intended to provide old-growth forest habitat, provide for populations of species that are associated with late-successional forests, and to help ensure that late-successional species diversity will be conserved. The management objective within LSRs is to protect and enhance conditions of late-successional forest ecosystems, which serve as habitat for late-successional and old-growth related species including the northern spotted owl (USDA, USDI 1994b). Protection includes reducing the risk of large-scale disturbance, including stand-replacing fire, insect and disease epidemic, and major human caused impacts. The purpose of this Forest-wide assessment is to develop management strategies for the LSRs, determine their sustainability, and provide information to decision makers for managing LSRs to meets Forest Plan goals and objectives.\nHayfork Adaptive Management Area Guide - 10-12-2004\nAppeals and Litigation Information\nShasta-Trinity National Forest managers make many resource management decisions, which may be subject to appeal (request to a higher authority for administrative review of a decision).

14	educational activities math counting children preschool workshop hands on manipulatives	There are several educational approaches to teach counting to young children. Children's books like 'How Many Feet In The Bed' allow children to practice counting and one-to-one correspondence. Workshop 4 'Tinkering with Manipulatives' specifically focuses on using manipulatives as tools for developing counting understanding in PreK and TK children through hands-on activities.	['Where is the Math in Children’s Books? – by Al Stewart\nNoted Early Childhood Consultant/Advocate, Al Stewart has generously agreed to Guest Blog for us from time to time. We are happy to share with you his first installment.\nMany professionals believe and understand that “math is everywhere”. We use math throughout the day beginning with setting alarms, to measuring the ingredients for making coffee, to following the speed limit, as well as purchasing meals, gas, etc. We cannot get away from math.\nThe American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language defines math as “The study of number, form, arrangement, and associated relationships, using rigorously defined literal, numerical, and operational symbols.” The broad topic of “mathematics” includes, but is not limited to; arithmetic, geometry, algebra, trigonometry and calculus. We can break those down to appropriate topics in mathematics for young children such as classification, seriation, numeration, geometry, measurement, parts/whole, and color, just to mention a few. A critical aspect of math for young children is the vocabulary. If our expectation is for children to learn math concepts, we must be sure that they comprehend the meaning of the math terms – i.e., vocabulary.\nThe use of children’s books to enhance the learning math of concepts is just one strategy that has been effective in settings for young children. There are books for counting, shapes and color, as well as other areas of math. A few of the books that were written with a mathematics “focus” are:\n- “Over in the Meadow” by Paul Galdone\n- “The Cheerios Counting Book – 1, 2, 3” by Barbara Barbieri McGrath\n- “Ten Little Fish” by Audrey Wood\n- “Chicka, Chicka 1, 2, 3” by Bill Martin, Jr.\n- “Big, Bigger, Biggest!” by Nancy Coffelt,\nand there are many, many more.\nThere are also many books written for young children addressing other areas, but which have math concepts embedded in the story. One of those is the familiar “Goldilocks and the Three Bears”. There are several versions of this story, but the characters are similar and familiar to all of us. The obvious math connections are that there are “3” bears and that they are different “sizes” – large, medium, and small. Other items mentioned in the story also appear in three sizes, corresponding to the bear family members. The order is more complicated than one would first realize: Mama Bear is both bigger than Baby Bear and smaller than Papa Bear. There is a direct correlation between the sizes of the bears and the sizes of the bowls, chairs, and beds; the bigger the bear; the bigger the bowl, chair, and/or bed. When asked which item belongs to which bear, and why, children are able to distinguish the size differences of the bears and the items. They can match the appropriate item to the correct bear family member. Young children are also able to identify other items that might be in the bears’ house, and to explain how they would know which one belongs to Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear. Just ask them.\n“How Many Feet In The Bed” by Diane Johnston Hamm is a book that allows the children to practice counting. The number of feet increases as family members gather in the parents’ bed. First, the father is alone in bed; then he is joined by the big sister, then the middle son, then the baby, and last, the mother. Counting after each person gets in the bed allows the children to practice one-to-one correspondence, as well as emphasizing that there are two more feet added each time. Suddenly, the mother must leave the bed (now how many are left in the bed?); then the father has to leave the bed (now how many are left in the bed?). Eventually no one is left in the bed – there are “zero” feet in the bed. Using a mat, a large towel, or a blanket, the children would be able to re-enact this story in the classroom. How much fun would that be? This story may be adapted by asking “How many feet are in the barn?”. Using cutouts of a barn, a variety of farm animals, the farmer, and the farmer’s son would lend itself to practicing counting the feet in the barn. Allowing the children to group farm animals by the number of feet they have would extend their understanding of quantity. This classification activity may be extended to discussing animals with two feet, four feet, and more than four feet, as well as animals with zero feet. Can you name any animals with more than six feet, or zero feet? Think “outside the box”.\nHere is a short list of other books that have mathematics concepts embedded in them:\n- “Today is Monday” by Eric Carle\n- “We’re Going on a Bear Hunt” by Michael Rosen and Helen Oxenbury\n- “I Went Walking” by Sue Williams\n- “Rosie’s Walk” by Pat Hutchins\n- “Sitting in My Box” by De Liffegard\n- “Ma Dear’s Apron” by Patricia C. McKissack\n- “Cookie’s Week” by Cindy Ward and Tomie dePaola.\nThese books provide opportunities for young children to better understand concepts in the mathematics topics of Time, Spatial Relationships, Size, Measurement, Ordinal Numbers, and more.\nJust remember that reading math storybooks, and storybooks with embedded math concepts, can stimulate children’s thinking, language, and enjoyment. Keep searching for the math. Enjoy!\nWith 45 years devoted to Early Childhood Education, Al Stewart has certainly made an impact on the lives of children and teachers alike.

15	how do redwoods and bristlecone pine trees respond differently to climate change effects	Redwoods and bristlecone pines face different challenges from climate change. Redwoods are threatened by the progressive loss of coastal fog, which has declined over 30%. Scientists are studying their growth patterns and responses to environmental changes to develop survival strategies, including protecting cooler and moister habitats. Bristlecone pines, on the other hand, are struggling because as temperatures warm, they need to move to higher elevations, but these areas are being populated by faster-growing limber pines that outcompete them for resources like light and water.	"['As the planet warms, will the progressive loss of coastal fog, which has declined over 30%, doom these beauties? KQED follows a team of UC Berekely researchers as they climb up into the crown of a huge old-growth redwood in Montgomery Woods to install monitoring equipment.\nRecent advances enable Save the Redwoods League and a team of pioneering scientists to unlock the record of environmental changes stored in redwood tree rings. From individual trees to whole forests, we will study redwood growth, vulnerabilities, early indicators of stress and how these trees might respond to predicted climate changes.\nSave the Redwoods League has united leading scientists Stephen C. Sillett and Robert Van Pelt of Humboldt State University and Todd Dawson and Anthony Ambrose of the University of California, Berkeley, to launch the Initiative. Their studies will yield results that quantify redwoods’ vulnerabilities to climatic changes and their capacities to mitigate these changes via photosynthesis, fog interception, wood production and carbon sequestration. They are uniquely qualified, in part, because they have developed many of the methods to obtain the study’s data.\nThe scientists are:\n- studying whole-tree and whole-forest rates of annual wood production back 1,000 years in forest plots throughout the redwood ranges. These measurements will help the team predict tree and forest growth in response to changing climates\n- reconstructing past climates to learn how redwoods responded to environmental conditions\n- assessing how redwoods are responding to current conditions\n- planning to manipulate temperature, carbon dioxide and water in greenhouse experiments to examine how redwood seedlings and saplings from different parts of the ranges might react to climatic changes\nStrategies for Survival\nPossible ways the Initiative findings could help redwoods survive in the future include\n- Protecting cooler and moister habitats so the trees will have a place to grow if their current range becomes too warm or dry\n- Guiding economic incentives for sustainable logging practices\n- Developing more sophisticated water and buffer management in the forecasted redwood range, in partnership with redwood forest landowners\n- Informing new public policy\nOutcomes of the Initiative\n- Gain the critical data necessary to develop strategies for helping redwoods adapt to rapid environmental changes, thereby protecting the diverse ecosystems they define\n- Understand how restoration techniques can utilize carbon storage potential in the redwoods\n- Focus our conservation work in the places that need it most\n- Preserve watersheds to benefit redwood ecosystems, wildlife and people\n- Restore forests for the future\n- Gather data to inform sound public policy and conservation management strategies\n- Create a model for studying and protecting other forest ecosystems in California, the Pacific Northwest and the world\n- Inspire renewed hope for future generations to experience the wonder of ancient redwood forests\nIntegrity, Power & Passion\nThe Integrity of the Initiative lies in the integrated nature of the collaboration. The best redwood scientists in the world will develop and use established protocols and cutting-edge technology, linking ground based data, watershed plots and airplane based LiDAR data to scale up the findings.\nThe Power of the Initiative is that the data will inform models to understand the past, analyze impacts of current environmental changes, and help develop adaptive strategies for the future.\nThe Passion for the Initiative is reflected in the League’s more than 90-year history of success in protecting the redwoods. We must protect the existing redwood forests and work to ensure the future of the species.\nWith your help, the Redwoods and Climate Change Initiative will succeed!', ""- Bristlecone pine, the world's oldest species of tree, may go extinct due to changing temperatures caused by climate change in the frigid mountains where they used to thrive.\n- Some of these trees are almost 5,000 years old, so their loss would be another devastating blow to the environment brought on by manmade climate change.\nAt 4,845 years old, Methuselah, a Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) in the White Mountains of California, is one of the oldest trees on Earth. It’s so old, in fact, that it was only a seedling when the Egyptian pyramids were being constructed. Since it first broke ground, the pine tree has survived wars, cultural upheavals, extreme weather conditions, and whatever else this world threw at it. Now, after more than 48 centuries of life and history, this tree is facing its toughest challenge yet: climate change.\nAround the world, giant, old trees like Methuselah stand as a living history of this planet, but a new study suggests that climate change could lead to their extinction. “I think what’s going to happen — at least in some areas — is that we’re going to lose bristlecone,” said Brian Smithers, an ecologist at the University of California and co-author of a recent study of the iconic forest giants.\nBristlecone pine have historically thrived in the upper elevations of California’s White Mountains because they have adapted to survive the temperatures found just below the tree line. As temperatures warm and the tree line moves higher up the mountains, it’s expected that this particular species would simply begin to seek out higher elevations as well. However, those higher areas are being populated more heavily by a different species, limber pines, thanks to the help of a bird species that spreads its seeds. “Whoever can get there first wins,” Smithers said. “And it looks like limber pine is just better able to get there quicker.”\nAs these limber pine trees grow, they could use up the light and water supplies that the slower-growing bristlecone pines that do sprout in the higher elevations need to survive, eventually taking over those higher elevations completely. The bristlecone pines left in the lower elevations could then succumb to the warmer, less desirable conditions brought on by climate change.\nThe loss of our planet’s oldest tree species isn’t exclusive to the bristlecone pine. According to an article published by ThinkProgress back in 2012, leading ecologists have already “documented an alarming increase in the death rate of trees between 100 and 300 years old in many of the world’s forests, woodlands, savannahs, farming areas, and even in cities.” As a response, researchers are urging an increased focus on efforts that can help us identify the cause of this rapid loss of historic trees so that strategies can be immediately implemented to manage its effects.\nA more recent study published in Nature World News looked into how the growth rate of trees changed historically under previous climate conditions. Those researchers projected that the United States will see a 75 percent decrease in its growth rate of trees in the southwest, and as the planet gets warmer, this will push numerous forests into critical levels as early as 2050. When that happens, our forests will be unable to help protect us from the effects of climate change by offsetting carbon emissions.\nCombine this negative impact on the planet’s tree species with the ever-increasing number of other plants and animals facing extinction, and you can see that humans are far from the only species battling the devastating consequences of manmade climate change.""]"	['<urn:uuid:ec634f65-8d3f-4dc8-b2ed-09368a569984>', '<urn:uuid:e23a195f-eefe-404d-8f39-4c8456d45b67>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	13	84	1178
16	best time catch snook night fishing	Night snook fishing can be productive around lighted docks and bridges in the ICW. The best spots are underwater lights from Longboat Key to Anna Maria, lighted bridge fenders at passes, and areas around sand and oyster bars, points of islands, and bridges close to passes. Small white flies like the Grassett Snook Minnow fly are particularly effective for night snook fishing.	['Spring is definitely in the air. It’s one of my favorite times of the year and one of the most productive for all anglers, whether they fish with fly, artificial lures or live bait. This week and next I will share some tips on getting the most out of spring, something I like to think of as spring training. First and foremost, anglers should realize that the major factors influencing fishing in April and early May will be weather and water temperature. Having said that, here are some suggestions from my friend Capt. Rick Grassett and me that we hope will lead to you maximizing the potential of spring.\nGrassett has specialized in night snook fishing for 30 years and suggests exploring lighted docks and bridges in the ICW at night. According to Grassett, night snook fishing should be productive with small white flies, like his Grassett Snook Minnow fly. He also recommends the flats, around sand and oyster bars, on points of islands and around docks and bridges close to passes in the ICW.\nI would suggest looking for the underwater lights that have been sprouting up from Longboat Key to Anna Maria. The lighted bridge fenders at the passes would also be a good option. I suggest you also look for snook in potholes near the mouth of the Manatee River and on the flats in Terra Ceia, Miguel and Tampa Bays.\nBefore rains cloud the water, explore the edges of the Manatee River from Tampa Bay to Bradenton. Grassett suggests trying lures like CAL jigs and a variety of plastic tails including the new 4-inch CAL Shad, DOA Baitbusters and Airheads or surface walking top water plugs. I like top water plugs and flies, including crease flies and gurglers, as well as old standbys like the Lefty’s Deceiver and the seaducer.\nTarpon are a passion of both of us, and Grassett says that, depending on the weather and water temperatures, tarpon will become more plentiful this month as resident fish make their way out of rivers and creeks and early arriving migratory fish begin to show along beaches. Water temperature in the Gulf is a key factor with 80 degrees being an optimum temperature.\nBut that doesn’t mean you won’t encounter a tarpon before that, so our advice is to be ready at all times. Grassett expects resident fish can be found rolling on deep grass flats, laid up on edges of shallow grass flats or along sand bars. Almost 10 years ago, Capt. Randy Fowler showed me laid up tarpon on a deep grass edge in Anna Maria Sound, and I’ve found them there on numerous occasions in April.\nReds and trout will also be more active as the water warms and baitfish become more plentiful. It might not be for everyone, but I occasionally like to target bonnethead sharks and houndfish on the fly. Both bonnethead sharks and houndfish are seasonal visitors to local waters and are best targeted on the sand bars and shoals from Egmont Key to Bean Point. Sight fish them using a small white baitfish pattern for the houndfish and a red and/or orange Clouser or seaducer for bonnet heads. Bend down your barbs (recommended for all fish) so you can remove your hook without coming into contact with either species’ sharp teeth.\nAnother species that provides anglers with some great action are Jack crevalle. Jacks aren’t good to eat and most anglers consider them a nuisance. Large Jacks can be a formidable adversary, and I’ve found top water plugs and flies to be the most effective. Most any species of bait from shiners to small pinfish will be attacked by foraging Jacks. I like top water whether I’m fishing spin tackle or fly. The noise and commotion attracts and is effective on most every fish that swims local waters and the visual reward of an explosion on the surface is “priceless.”\nGrassett suggests looking for Spanish mackerel, blues and pompano in the local passes or on the deep grass flats of Sarasota Bay. The same applies to the approaches to Tampa Bay. False albacore (little tunny), cobia and tripletail will all be present in the coastal Gulf this month from Egmont Key to Big Pass and beyond. The bottom line is that you should get out on the water whenever possible and enjoy the opportunities the season offers. Just think of it as spring training!']	['<urn:uuid:8dcaca55-7e46-4c6b-b183-af729e51a959>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	6	62	735

One key reason: the blood-brain barrier, which protects the brain from tissue-specific drug delivery. Methods such as an injection or a pill aren\'t as precise or immediate as doctors might prefer, and ensuring delivery right to the brain often requires invasive, risky techniques.\nA team of engineers from Washington University in St. Louis has developed a new nanoparticle generation-delivery method that could someday vastly improve drug delivery to the brain, making it as simple as a sniff.\n""This would be a nanoparticle nasal spray, and the delivery system could allow a therapeutic dose of medicine to reach the brain within 30 minutes to one hour,"" said Ramesh Raliya, research scientist at the School of Engineering & Applied Science.\n""The blood-brain barrier protects the brain from foreign substances in the blood that may injure the brain,"" Raliya said. ""But when we need to deliver something there, getting through that barrier is difficult and invasive. Our non-invasive technique can deliver drugs via nanoparticles, so there\'s less risk and better response times.""\nThe novel approach is based on aerosol science and engineering principles that allow the generation of monodisperse nanoparticles, which can deposit on upper regions of the nasal cavity via diffusion. Working with Assistant Vice Chancellor Pratim Biswas, chair of the Department of Energy, Environmental & Chemical Engineering and the Lucy & Stanley Lopata Professor, Raliya developed an aerosol consisting of gold nanoparticles of controlled size, shape and surface charge. The nanoparticles were tagged with fluorescent markers, allowing the researchers to track their movement.\nNext, Raliya and biomedical engineering postdoctoral fellow Debajit Saha exposed locusts\' antennae to the aerosol, and observed the nanoparticles travel from the antennas up through the olfactory nerves. Due to their tiny size, the nanoparticles passed through the brain-blood barrier, reaching the brain and suffusing it in a matter of minutes.\nThe team tested the concept in locusts because the blood-brain barriers in the insects and humans have anatomical similarities, and the researchers consider going through the nasal regions to neural pathways as the optimal way to access the brain.\n""The shortest and possibly the easiest path to the brain is through your nose,"" said Barani Raman, associate professor of biomedical engineering. ""Your nose, the olfactory bulb and then olfactory cortex: two relays and you\'ve reached the cortex. The same is true for invertebrate olfactory circuitry, although the latter is a relatively simpler system, with supraesophageal ganglion instead of an olfactory bulb and cortex.""\nTo determine whether or not the foreign nanoparticles disrupted normal brain function, Saha examined the physiological response of olfactory neurons in the locusts before and after the nanoparticle delivery. Several hours after the nanoparticle uptake, no noticeable change in the electrophysiological responses was detected.\n""This is only a beginning of a cool set of studies that can be performed to make nanoparticle-based drug delivery approaches more principled,"" Raman said.\nThe next phase of research involves fusing the gold nanoparticles with various medicines, and using ultrasound to target a more precise dose to specific areas of the brain, which would be especially beneficial in brain-tumor cases.\n""We want to drug target delivery within the brain using this non-invasive approach,"" Raliya said. ""In the case of a brain tumor, we hope to use focused ultrasound so we can guide the particles to collect at that particular point.""\nExplore further: Gelatin nanoparticles could deliver drugs to the brain\nRamesh Raliya et al, Non-invasive aerosol delivery and transport of gold nanoparticles to the brain, Scientific Reports (2017).

You can share poems on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, or via email, using websites such as Poets.org, The Poetry Foundation, Poem Hunter, and Old Poetry.	['Put a Poem in Your Pocket – Or on Your Feed\nPoets.org suggests participating in Poem in Your Pocket Day on April 18; visit their page for more details and to access links to poems you can carry with you throughout the day. But rather than simply sharing your pocket poem with co-workers, family, and friends as the site suggests, why not put a modern twist on this fun idea? Many websites, including Poets.org., The Poetry Foundation, Poem Hunter, Old Poetry (oldpoetry.com) and more will allow you to share poems with the click of an icon. Post your favorite poems to Facebook or share them via Twitter or email.\nTake a Poet to Lunch\nOf course, if you know any poets, buying them lunch would be a great way to celebrate poetry month. But for those of us without connections, a fun alternative is to tuck a poem into someone’s lunchbox for them to find when they sit down to eat that afternoon. Or pack yourself a favorite poem, or a whole book of them, to nourish your body and your soul come lunchtime. For a child, why not use Magnetic Poetry as an inspiration and include a bag of poetic words next to the bag of apple slices? Your child and his/her friends can create their own poems while they eat!\nEnjoy Poetry-Inspired Media\nThe Outsiders was inspired, in part, by Robert Frost’s Nothing Gold Can Stay. What would Dead Poets Society be without “O Captain, my Captain”? Plenty of books and movies center around poetry, and there are also a number of wonderful movies about the lives of famous poets. Poets.org hosts a long list of great films to enjoy. Or, challenge your family to think of as many books as they can which are focused on poetry. One of our recent favorites is Matched by Ally Condie, which centers around themes in Dylan Thomas’s Do Not Go Gentle.\nRead Poetry – as a Novel\nThere are many wonderful novels available for young people that are written in verse. These can be great options for unsteady readers because verse looks much less intimidating than dense paragraphs on a page. Try titles like Love that Dog by Sharon Creech (also, look for Hate that Cat), What My Mother Doesn’t Know by Sonya Somes, Out of the Dust and Aleutian Sparrow by Karen Hesse, The Surrender Tree by Margarita Engle, Crashboomlove by Juan Felipe Herrera, and The First Part Last by Angela Johnson.\nTrade Your Bedtime Story for a Poetry Reading\nInstead of reading a traditional picture book to your children as you tuck them in, opt for fun, child-friendly poems like those of Jack Prelutzky or Shel Silverstein, or reach for classics like A Child’s Garden of Verses by Robert Louis Stevenson, When We Were Very Young by A.A. Milne, or Appley Dapply’s Nursery Rhymes by Beatrix Potter.

19	What is the main purpose of environmental impact assessments?	Environmental impact assessments aim to identify potentially adverse impacts on people and the environment at an early stage, achieve transparency, and ensure mitigation measures are integrated into project development. They are required for certain projects like hazardous waste incineration plants or nuclear power plant dismantling, and involve local residents, nature conservation organizations, and public authorities.	['Tools for environmental protection: Environmental impact assessments and strategic environmental assessments\nRoads, business parks, refineries, large-scale incineration plants: constructing infrastructure and industrial sites has a significant impact on the environment. It is the task of the public authorities to assess how these schemes will affect people, flora and fauna in particular, but also soil, water, air quality and the climate.\nIn order to identify potentially adverse impacts on the environment at an early stage and protect public health, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) or strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is conducted ahead of certain types of projects or construction schemes. So when is it necessary to apply these tools? This is regulated by Germany’s Environmental Impact Assessment Act (Gesetz über die Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung – UVPG).\nEnvironmental impact assessments (EIAs) for licensing procedures\nThe construction and operation of a hazardous waste incineration plant or the dismantling of a nuclear power plant require an EIA. Local residents, nature conservation organisations and the public authorities are involved in this process. The aim is to achieve transparency, identify potentially negative impacts on people and the environment and ensure that mitigation measures are integrated into project development.\nStrategic environmental assessments (SEAs) for infrastructure programmes\nAn SEA is conducted in federal transport infrastructure planning, regional and area development planning, water resources and waste management, air pollution control and noise protection, for example. It is a systematic process which aims to ensure that environmental aspects are considered in strategic planning. It is therefore applied at an earlier stage, namely during project planning.\nInterdisciplinary methods and many years of experience\nThe Oeko-Institut supports the competent federal and regional-state authorities in conducting environmental impact assessments and strategic environmental assessments. The Oeko-Institut’s team of scientists, engineers and lawyers applies interdisciplinary methods which have proved their worth over decades. The main areas of work are:\n- conducting environmental impact assessments for the decommissioning and dismantling of nuclear power plants, research reactors, interim storage facilities and other nuclear installations,\n- screening of nuclear facilities’ environmental impacts,\n- strategic environmental assessments of nuclear facilities,\n- expert opinions on the transboundary environmental impacts of other countries’ nuclear facilities on Germany.\nThe Oeko-Institut experts\n- make a preliminary assessment to determine whether an EIA is needed (screening),\n- provide support for the project application conference (scoping),\n- make recommendations on the parameters and methodology for the assessment,\n- verify that documentation is complete and suitable for public consultation,\n- provide support for technical meetings and public consultations,\n- review and evaluate possible objections and expert opinions,\n- draft a synopsis and a recommendation for assessment by the authorities, generally including proposed conditions and advice on impact mitigation, and\n- produce the environmental report as the basis for public participation in the SEA.\nThe Oeko-Institut has access to a comprehensive professional network and can draw on many years of experience in conducting stakeholder and public consultations. This is particularly useful for controversial projects such as the construction of interim storage facilities for radioactive waste. Legal restrictions may apply to precautionary environmental assessments; in such cases, the Oeko-Institut’s researchers make use of any discretionary scope that may be available in order to maximise the protection afforded to people and the environment.\nExample: environmental impact assessment of nuclear power plant dismantling\nA key challenge arising in connection with the phase-out of nuclear energy is the dismantling of nuclear power plants, which requires the assessment of a wide range of potential environmental impacts. In addition to the dismantling itself, it is often necessary to build and operate various new facilities, mainly for the conditioning and interim storage of radioactive waste. The Oeko-Institut’s experts identify the factors which are likely to impact on the environment, such as noise, air pollution, contamination of soil and water or the release of ionising radiation, and\n- analyse the factors with potentially adverse environmental impacts,\n- characterise their direct and indirect environmental impacts,\n- conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses,\n- produce recommendations on how these impacts can be avoided or mitigated.\nMost nuclear power plants are located along large rivers in order to ensure an adequate supply of cooling water. Although they are generally sited away from major cities, there may be small clusters of housing in their immediate vicinity – perhaps just a few hundred metres away. There may also be floodplain landscapes and nature conservation areas nearby. It can therefore be necessary to appraise the impacts of noise on birds and bats, for example; in many cases, special measures must be taken to protect them. However, no legal limit values apply to such appraisals; instead, a case-by-case approach is adopted to determine whether serious adverse impacts can be ruled out.\nAs regards the impacts of radioactive substances, the evaluations by the Oeko-Institut’s experts start well below the dose limits set in the German Radiation Protection Ordinance (Strahlenschutzverordnung). This approach is intended to fulfil the EIA’s precautionary function and reflects the fact that no minimum threshold level can be set for radiation exposure.']	['<urn:uuid:06856aaa-ff76-4cab-96a2-6526fb444de9>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	9	55	828
20	I need to make some precise cuts for a door frame project - can you explain what bevel and miter cuts are, and what kind of saw blade would work best for this?	A bevel cut is made obliquely relative to the sheet width or length, created by turning the saw head left or right from the axis. A miter cut is performed at an angle relative to the workpiece thickness, done by adjusting the blade tilt. For door frame projects that require precise cuts, you'd want a blade specifically designed for fine crosscutting in wood. Look for blades with more teeth for smoother cuts - for example, a 60-tooth fine blade would provide precise cuts in wood and wood composites. The blade should have features like tungsten carbide tips for durability and sharpness retention. For best results, choose a blade with a thin kerf (the width of the cut) as this provides even and quick incisions with minimum debris.	['There are so many different types of saws on the market today that figuring out what you need exactly might be tricky. To choose a truly suitable tool, you have to understand the characteristics of each kind.\nIn this article, I’ll talk about devices with a double bevel feature. Why are these tools effective? Are they irreplaceable in a workshop?\nI’m sure that after reading it, you’ll be able to make an informed decision and understand whether you need such a tool, or you can get by with a classic model.\n- 1 Double Bevel Compound Miter Saw Guide\n- 1.1 What is a dual bevel miter saw?\n- 1.2 Difference between dual bevel and compound miter saws\n- 1.3 Single bevel vs. double bevel\n- 1.4 Reasons to use a dual bevel miter saw\n- 1.5 Do I need a double bevel miter saw?\n- 1.6 Definition of a bevel cut and a miter cut\n- 1.7 What is a compound miter saw?\n- 1.8 Get Dual Bevel Miter Saw for Pro Tasks\nDouble Bevel Compound Miter Saw Guide\nA dual bevel saw is an indispensable machine in carpentry. Unlike standard models and even more so circular saws, it allows you to make an ultra-precise double bevel cut. With it, you can build door and window frames, cut parquet boards and laminates, process aluminum, and plastic C-channels, and much more.\nWhat is a dual bevel miter saw?\nWith miter saws, you can cut a wide variety of materials (provided you have the right blade), but they are primarily designed for woodworking. The existing subtypes of these tools greatly facilitate the processing of workpieces, which can be really convenient for large-scale work. Double bevel instruments are no exception.\nIn this type of device, you can turn and tilt both a disk and a head itself in the direction you want. It greatly expands the possibilities of using the device. Besides, if you need to do several different cuts on one workpiece, you do not have to turn the material over, as it should be done with standard models.\nSimply move boards and change the blade and/or head angles. Technically, you can make such cuts with a compound saw, but the need to constantly turn workpieces (especially if there are really a lot of them) on the other side slows down the workflow.\nDifference between dual bevel and compound miter saws\nIt is not difficult to understand the difference between these types. The term ‘compound’ is applied to those tools in which a head with an attached blade can be tilted.\nYou can do bevel and miter cuts with it, but only in one direction. It distinguishes these devices from standard ones, which can rip material only at right angles.\nAlthough compared to classical models, compound miter saws are more versatile; they still do not offer the same flexibility as dual bevel miter saws. In the latter, a head with a disk tilts to both sides.\nIf necessary, it allows you to make cuts at different angles without turning your workpiece, but by adjusting the head at once to rip the material as you need.\nSingle bevel vs. double bevel\nAs you have probably understood from the previous part of my article, compound and single bevel saws are different names for the same tool. Its head with a blade can be tilted to one side (usually to the left), hence the word “single” in the title.\nA double bevel saw is an improved version of the previous device, the head of which you can turn both left and right. Despite this seemingly insignificant difference, it comes with higher usability, increased productivity, and the ability to complete complex projects quickly.\nThe opportunity to cut without flipping the workpiece is extremely useful when working with challenging materials such as plywood. Chips might form on it where a blade enters a sheet.\nThat is why it is convenient that you can cut at different ends of a workpiece but at the same time on one side of a sheet. You can rotate plywood so that chips appear on the side that will not be visible.\nReasons to use a dual bevel miter saw\nThe advantage of all types of miter saws is their incredible cutting accuracy. The devices considered in this article are good because they can perform the so-called compound cuts.\nThey are a combination of the bevel (tilt relative to material thickness) and miter (tilt relative to material width) cuts. Some kinds of projects like doorstops and photo frames simply cannot do without these kinds of rips.\nWhat is the main difference between a single and a dual bevel mitre saw if both of these tools can do complex cuts? The second option allows you to make mirror rips without having to turn wood.\nFor example, you need two cuts in the opposite direction at both ends of the board if you build a door frame. With a double bevel saw, you can cut one end, change the tilt of a disk, and cut the other. Remember that you should calibrate your instrument for the work result to be perfect.\nSomeone might think that all this is too easy. However, this feature is really handy if you work on a large-scale project where you have to do such symmetrical cuts several times a day.\nDo I need a double bevel miter saw?\nIf you’re asking yourself whether you need a saw that can tilt to both sides, then carefully consider your tasks. Suppose you regularly make cuts in different directions and at various angles, as professional carpenters do, and you are tired of constantly turning boards.\nIn that case, you definitely cannot do without a dual bevel tool. Opt for simpler models if the need to do cuts in different directions arises from time to time.\nOf course, the double bevel feature saves a lot of time if you regularly handle many boards. However, this versatility tends to be worth the extra money.\nComparing a single vs. a double bevel miter saw, the second one is much more expensive. From my experience, I can say that all these “fancy” features pay off only when they are constantly used. Otherwise, I think it won’t be that tiresome for you to turn a workpiece and cut the other side.\nIn addition to the higher cost of a double version, I also draw your attention to its more complex design, and, therefore, more bulky construction. It is less mobile and takes up slightly more space than single bevel saws.\nBesides, given its great capabilities, you will need to spend some time getting used to working with it and learning how to cut in different directions.\nAfter deciding which type of device you want, you can choose a specific model. As with any saw, you should pay attention to power, speed, RPM control, cutting depth and width, soft start, automatic shutdown, and so on.\nIf you want even more freedom of action while working, check out a dual bevel sliding mitre saw, which moves along the work surface.\nDefinition of a bevel cut and a miter cut\nThe simplest and most commonly required cut that conventional tools can make is a 90° straight one. However, in addition to it, other options might be needed in woodworking.\nA bevel cut is made obliquely relative to the sheet width (or length). The angle can be any other than the right one. To do it, turn the head of your device to the left or right from the axis. Typically it is used to create windows, boxes, doors, frames, etc.\nIn contrast, a miter cut is performed at an angle relative to the workpiece thickness (depth). In this case, the angle can also be any that you need, except for a straight one. To create this cut, adjust the tilt of a blade. You can often see it used by professionals in joinery or welding jobs.\nThere is also a third cut type that combines the features of these two. It’s called a compound cut. You will need to adjust both the saw head and the disk to get the angle you want in relation to the board width and depth.\nIf you have any difficulty with estimations, use a specialized calculator. As you can imagine, it is almost impossible to do such high-quality cuts with hand-held tools. That is why miter saws with a solid and stable base are used.\n- Radial Arm Saw vs Miter Saw\n- 7 Best Cordless Miter Saws\n- 7 Best Budget Miter Saws\n- Miter Saw vs Table Saw\n- 7 Best Miter Saw Stands\n- Sliding vs Non-Sliding Miter Saw\n- How to Cut a 22.5 Degree Angle on a Miter Saw\n- How to Cut Baseboards With a Miter Saw\n- How to Cut Crown Molding With a Miter Saw\nWhat is a compound miter saw?\nCompared with standard models, compound machines have slightly improved functionality and, therefore, are more versatile. Modern devices cut workpieces at various angles, even in two planes. Powerful motors built into them help cut wood, plastic, thin metal profiles and pipes, and wood-based composite materials.\nCompound miter saws are also called single bevels because they can generally tilt in only one way. You need a dual bevel saw if you want the head and blade to turn both left and right. If your work is commercial, you cannot do without such a device.\nThanks to its versatility, it performs well in small carpentry businesses, construction sites, and even in-home workshops. Regardless of the purpose of using a device, do not forget about the standard safety measures.\nGet Dual Bevel Miter Saw for Pro Tasks\nThis type of saw is a handy tool in certain situations. If you plan to work with wood and other materials for commercial purposes, you should definitely buy one.\nIf your intention is to use the functionality offered by double bevel saws once or twice a month, I recommend you not waste your money and choose a standard or single bevel option. However, it is up to you to decide.\nPlease share your opinion on a dual bevel miter saw. Do you have any experience using it? Do you think that every DIYer should have such a model?', 'The smoothness and fineness of cuts are determined by the blade you use on your miter saw. To get the best miter saw blade for use in cutting materials in your project, you need to analyze the specifications of the blades. However, this might be difficult, because the market has different blades from different manufacturers. Different blades have different designs and are used on different miter saws. Some blades serve specific purposes, while others are designed to serve general purposes. Here is a buying guide of miter blades to help you in choosing a blade that suits your purpose.\nLast update on 2018-08-13 PST - Details\nFactors To Consider When Buying Miter Saw Blade\nPurpose of the blade\nYou should consider the purpose of your mite saw, to choose the appropriate miter saw blade. In short, to select a good miter blade make you know the materials you will be cutting using the blade. Some blades are multi-purpose while others specifically designed to cut specific types of materials.\nBefore you start any project, ensure the blade you want to purchase can cut the materials you will be using. To easily identify the blade, check the manufacturer, since they have different configurations.\nNevertheless, if your projects are flexible, buy more than one blade, since changing blades in most saws is easier. It is a good option instead of depending on a single blade to cut different types of materials.\nThe diameter of the miter saw\nMiter saw blades are of different sizes, and fits in different miter saws. Therefore, make sure you consider the diameter of your miter saw, to avoid using the wrong the blade. The use of a wrong saw leads to problems when trying to cut using the saw.\nThe regular sizes of miter saws are four, 12inches, 10 inches, 8.5 inches and 7.5 inches. Thus a miter saw blade of 10 inches cannot fit a 12 inches miter blade. If you choose the wrong the blade, it might not fit appropriately in the blade slots, as well as accommodating the cutting range of the saw.\nHowever, many miter saws feature a built-in defense from the use of wrong blades. To avoid wastage of your money on the blade, consider the diameter of the saw.\nDifferent blades have different specifications, with some having a design that can be used on various saws like radial arms, table saws and miter saws. To ensure the blade you choose has specifications that suits your saw; make sure you check the manual. The specifications of the blade you need use are determined by the make of your saw.\nGeneral Features To Consider in Miter Saw Blades\nThe design of the teeth\nThe shape of the teeth determines the design of blades of different miter saws. Among the teeth to find on miter saw blades are intricate designed teeth and simple triangular teeth featuring negative or positive rakes. Simple teeth are considered to be effective in wood work, as well as easier to sharpen and maintain.\nSome of the common designs of blades to find in miter saws are triple chid grind, alternating top bevel, flat top gringo, steep and high alternating top bevel and alternating face and top.\nNumber of teeth\nThe effectiveness of the cutting blade is determined by the number of teeth. Many teeth give a fine and smoother cut, while fewer teeth on a blade make it easier to cut thick materials. Also, medium numbers of teeth are effective for cutting plastic, to avoid the melting of the plastic. However, you should not that the tooth count increases with the increase in blade size.\nTop 5 Miter Saw Blades\nThe kerf saw blade is ultra-thin, and it can be used in table and miter saws. The combo pack has two blades that are both 10’’ in diameter, .097’’ kerf; .071’’plate an alternate top bevel and a +5 degree hook angle.

21	curious about ancient air bubbles trapped in ice what they reveal	Analysis of air trapped in ancient ice cores reveals information about trace gases such as carbon dioxide and methane in Earth's past atmosphere. Scientists in laboratories in France and Switzerland found that these gases' concentrations closely followed temperature patterns - when temperatures were cold, carbon dioxide and methane levels were low, and when temperatures were warm, both gases were present in high concentrations.

From high up, the frozen white endless desert in the interior seems utterly hostile to the observer; the eye wanders in search of markers to fasten on but fails to penetrate the cold haze. The margins, on the other hand, are spectacular, with dramatic crags and steep-walled ice-filled valleys where the glacier tongues leave the main body and seek their way to the ocean, feeding it with icebergs. A geologist can readily sense the relentless motion of these ice streams running down into the fjords, at an imperceptibly slow speed, but powerful in purpose, removing what is in their way and carving ever deeper ravines into the hard host rock.\nCartoon of water molecules\n, with and without deuterium\n. Remember that the oxygen atom\nin each of these can also vary its isotope value as well, either as O-16 or O-18. Since the coldest snow is the lightest (containing the least D and O-18), analysis of these isotopes\nin polar ice allows for the reconstruction of past temperatures\nThe icy wastelands of Greenland and Antarctica have something extremely precious to offer, which makes some scientists want to spend months at a time there, even while enduring hard labor: the memories of the ice. As was described in Lesson 4, year after year the layers of snow turn to ice, as new layers are added on top. The frozen water contains a record of the conditions under which the snow fell, in the form of the isotopic composition of the ice. The isotopes of interest are hydrogen (H) and its heavy sibling deuterium (D), as well as oxygen-16 and oxygen-18, which have been described previously in connection with the deep-sea record in foraminifers. Water vapor turns to precipitation over the polar ice sheet more readily when it has the composition HOD and H18OH than if it is normal water, H16OH. As air cools upon climbing up an ice shield, water changes phase from vapor to liquid, thus losing D and 18O preferentially. This means that the coldest snow has the least D and 18O in it.\nWith this basic information (and some statistics and isotope chemistry) we can extract a temperature record from the ice on Greenland for the last 100,000 years. For Antarctica, a record going back 400,000 years has been reconstructed. To this end, scientists employ heated drills, which penetrate the ice layers one after one from the surface on down, and recover cylindrical cores of ice one after another until the bottom of the ice is reached. The ice cores are then sampled, and the composition of the water is measured in the laboratory using mass spectrometers. Then, when plotting the ratio of D/H or 18O/16O, a record of temperature change emerges. (Actually, as described in Section 7.0, what is plotted is the percent deviation of the isotope ratio from the value of a standard, which simplifies the relationship to temperature.)\nAncient Glacial Ice Composition\nThe founding event of ice-core science may be taken as the publication of several articles in 1969 by the Danish chemist Willi Dansgaard, professor in Kopenhagen, Denmark, and his collaborators. Their first important result was the determination of the composition of Greenland ice for the last 100,000 years. Assuming that glacial-age ice had a similar ratio of O-18 to O-16, this is a much better guess than Emiliani's Chicago snowfall model, and the composition of the glacial ocean could now be guessed with much greater confidence. It turned out that the deviation from present-day conditions was really twice greater during the glacial period than had been postulated by Emiliani, so that much of the variation of the oxygen isotope signal detected by Emiliani had to be ascribed to the effects of ice-buildup and decay rather than to temperature.Just as important was the second finding that the oxygen isotope composition of glacial ice varies with time, and that it faithfully reflects glacial and interglacial conditions. To bring out this pattern, Dansgaard and his co-workers had to date the raw ice record with simple flow model based on the movement of large glaciers. As the ice sheet maintains the balance between thickening on top, and moving horizontally toward the sea, the patterns of flow are such as to maintain thick layers in the upper half of the glacier (which gets carried along by the flow below) and greatly thinning the layers in the more mobile lower half, and especially on approaching bedrock.\nThe third important result is that the temperature variations are much larger for glacial time than for interglacial time. This suggests that the climate was much more fickle when large ice sheets covered Canada and Scandinavia, compared with periods when these areas were free of ice. The presence of ice sheets did not stabilize climate (as one might expect) but introduced instability. Many geologists believe that this instability came from the ice itself. From time to time small changes in climate led to sudden surging of large glaciers which covered much of the North Atlantic with icebergs. Such events, presumably, came suddenly and unannounced. They produced severe winters and poor summers, which was bad for growing things, and resulted in starving mammoths and other large mammals. If this is so, the herds of the large mammals in North America and in Eurasia were in worse shape than ever at the end of the last ice age, around 15,000 years ago.\nA record of temperature change in Greenland, based on isotopes\nOther Information from Ice Cores\nBesides temperature, many other types of information can be extracted from ice cores by analyzing wind-blown dust, volcanic matter, and trapped air. The dust content of glacial ice in Greenland is more than ten times greater than that in ice made during warm intervals. This suggests that glacial periods tended to have dry weather and strong winds, in the regions south of the ice shields. (Cold air holds much less water vapor than warm, so this is not surprising.) During a cold dust storm in the plains, the thick matted hair of mammoth must have been a real life-saver.\nA record of volcanic activity is preserved in the amount of acid found in the ice. Some layers are very rich in acid, presumably from the sulfuric matter entrained by the snow at the time, in the atmosphere, after an eruption. These intervals also tend to show low temperature! This relationship strongly suggests that volcanism influences climate. More volcanism means cooler summers and more severe winters. The resulting catastrophic weather, following such eruptions, must have greatly stressed the populations of mammoth and other large mammals that need much food and cannot hide in burrows and caves. (In light of this data it cannot be entirely excluded that Icelandic sagas refer to such events in a legend about the end of the world, which includes a terrible winter lasting three years. If they do, their tribal tradition would have to reach back 11,000 years! However, the legend could easily refer to more recent events such as the eruption of Santorini, 3500 years ago.)\nIn addition, the air trapped in the ice can be analyzed for trace gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. This was done in laboratories in France (in Grenoble, by the physicist Claude Lorius and his co-workers) and in Switzerland (in Bern, by the physicist Hans Oeschger and his team). Results show that the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere closely follows the ups and downs of temperature. Whenever it was cold, carbon dioxide and methane were low in concentration, whenever it was warm, they were both high.""]"	['<urn:uuid:78eec99d-48a3-4dd4-8d66-4d139f9062d5>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	11	63	1425
22	what problems chimney maintenance winter safety guidelines	Regular chimney maintenance and safety guidelines are crucial, especially in winter. According to the NFPA, chimneys should be inspected by a professional before every heating season and cleaned if necessary. Creosote, a chemical substance that forms when wood burns, builds up in chimneys and can cause chimney fires if not removed. Professional cleaning removes dangerous substances like soot (a black flaky substance from incomplete burning), creosote (smoke and vapor residue), and glaze (a shiny, tar-like substance). The flue lining should also be checked for cracks to prevent house fires. Additionally, when using fireplaces, always use a sturdy fireplace screen, burn only wood (never paper or pine boughs), and avoid using flammable liquids.	"[""December, January and February are the leading months for U.S. home fires and home fire deaths, according to the National Fire Protection Association.\nOn average, more than one-third of home fire deaths in the United States occur during the winter months.\nSafer Home Heating\nThe NFPA's latest report on U.S. home heating fire patterns indicates that heating equipment fires are the third-leading cause of fire deaths in American homes and the biggest fire culprit from December through January.\nNFPA experts say that most U.S. home fires caused by heating equipment could be prevented by taking simple safety precautions.\nAccording to the report, the major causes of U.S. home heating fires are:\n- Lack of regular cleaning of chimneys in fireplaces and woodstoves\n- Placing things that can burn too close to space and portable heaters\n- Flaws in design, installation or use\n- Fueling errors involving liquid- or gas-fueled heaters\n- Leaving portable or space heaters unattended\nTips for Preventing Heating Equipment Fires\nWhen purchasing new heating equipment, the NFPA advises selecting equipment that bears the mark of an independent testing laboratory.\nInstall and maintain heating equipment correctly, and be sure that it complies with local fire and building codes.\nWhere possible, have local building or fire officials check the installation and maintenance.\nHere are some specific fire prevention tips from the NFPA to keep in mind when heating your home:\nPortable and Other Space Heaters\n- Portable and space heaters can be either electric-powered or fueled by gas, liquid fuel (usually kerosene) or solid fuel (usually wood).\n- All types must be kept at least 36 inches (1 meter) from anything that can burn, including furniture, bedding, clothing, pets and people.\n- Space heaters must not be left operating when you are not in the room or when you go to sleep.\n- Children and pets should be supervised at all times when space heaters are in use.\n- Ensure that everyone is aware of the high fire hazard associated with drying clothing or placing combustibles over heaters.\n- If you have an electric space heater, check each season for fraying or splitting wires or overheating.\n- Have all problems repaired by a professional before operating the space heater.\nPortable Kerosene Heaters\n- If you have a liquid-fueled space heater, use only the fuel recommended by the manufacturer. Never use gasoline or any other substitute fuel, because the wrong fuel could burn hotter than the equipment's design limits and cause a serious fire.\n- When refueling, always turn off the heater and let it cool down completely before adding fuel. Wipe up any spills promptly.\n- If you are considering buying a kerosene heater, be sure to check with your local fire department first to find out if it is legal in your community.\n- Store the kerosene away from heat or open flame in a container approved by the local fire department, and be sure that it is clearly marked with the fuel name.\n- Have your chimney inspected by a professional before the start of every heating season and cleaned if necessary.\n- Creosote, a chemical substance that forms when wood burns, builds up in chimneys and can cause a chimney fire if not removed through cleaning.\n- Always protect your home and your family by using a sturdy fireplace screen when burning fires.\n- Remember to burn only wood. Never burn paper or pine boughs, which can float out the chimney and ignite your roof or a neighboring home.\n- Do not use flammable liquids in a fireplace.\n- If you are purchasing a factory-built fireplace, select one listed by a testing laboratory, and have it installed according to local codes.\n- If you decorate your fireplace with Christmas stockings or other seasonal decorations, don't burn fires in it.\n- Be sure that your wood stove bears the mark of an independent testing laboratory and meets local fire codes.\n- Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for proper installation, use and maintenance.\n- Chimney connections and chimney flues should be inspected at the beginning of each heating season and cleaned when necessary.\n- Follow the same safety rules for wood stoves as you would for space heaters.\n- Burn only wood, and be sure that the wood stove is placed on an approved stove board to protect the floor from heat and hot coals.\n- Check with your local fire department and local code officials before having your wood stove installed.\nPortable LP Gas (propane) heaters with self-contained fuel supplies (cabinet heaters) are prohibited for home use by NFPA fire safety standards.\nSource: National Fire Protection Association"", 'Fireplace Safety During the Winter Holidays\nThe winter holiday season is the most joyous time of the year for many families. Bright decorations on the mantle make warming by the fireplace even more special than usual. But before enjoying your fireplace during the wintertime, it’s important to get your annual chimney cleaning and inspection. In addition to that, there are special fire prevention steps to take especially during the holidays.\nCleaning and Inspection\nThe National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) recommends getting your chimney cleaned and inspected annually. There are several hazards which are eliminated when a professional chimney sweep cleans your chimney, including the removal of soot, creosote, and glaze.\nSoot is a black flaky or powdery substance that is created by the incomplete burning of logs. Soot consists primarily of amorphous carbon but also contains some ash. The less ash is in the mix, the more dangerous soot is, since carbon is highly flammable and creates a greater risk of a chimney fire.\nCreosote is a substance that builds up in your chimney and can create chimney fires, as well. Creosote is smoke and vapor residue from wood that doesn’t burn completely. A highly flammable material, creosote leaves hard, flaky deposits in your chimney liner. Get your chimney cleaned anytime creosote or soot builds up to a layer thicker than ¼ inch.\nGlaze is a shiny, tar-like substance which creates black puddles in your chimney. Glaze is more difficult to remove than soot or creosote, and it’s a more dangerous fire hazard because it’s dense. Glaze also sometimes creates icicle-like deposits which hang above your fireplace. Remove glaze if it gets 1/8 of an inch thick or more.\nA chimney inspection could reveal that your flue lining is cracked. When there is a crack, it means that the heat from the fireplace could enter your home and create a house fire. A flue lining crack should be repaired before using the fireplace.\nChimney Cleaning Procedures\nThere’s no need to worry that a chimney sweep will make a mess of your home. Advanced methods of chimney cleaning combined with the special care we take in your home mean that you can be confidence that your chimney will be cleaned without leaving sooty residue behind.\nOur chimney sweeps have brushes and high-powered vacuums which run along the walls of your chimney and prevent the substances from the chimney from entering your home.\nWe also use brushes, wire cables, and chains which are twisted and turned by a motor at a rapid speed to clear the chimney shaft of creosote, soot, and glaze deposits. Chemicals can also be used to give the chimney liner a thorough cleaning.\nOther Fire Prevention Tips\n• Install smoke alarms on every level of your home; check the batteries regularly to make sure the alarms are working properly.\n• Get a carbon dioxide alarm which will alert you if carbon dioxide poisoning becomes a threat. This is an important precautionary step, since you can’t smell this deadly gas.\n• Dispose of ashes with great care to make sure that an unexpected fire will not start due to hot ashes.\n• Burn only seasoned firewood in your fireplace or wood stove. The less moisture there is in your firewood, the less soot and creosote buildup there will be.\nSome tips specifically for the holidays include:\n• Because they are highly combustible, don’t place wrapped packages or gift boxes near the fireplace. Keep all combustible materials at least 3 feet away from heat sources such as candles, portable heaters, fireplaces, and wood stoves.\n• Wrapping paper contains additives which make it burn at extremely high temperatures; don’t burn wrapping paper in your fireplace.\n• Do not dispose of wrapping paper, boxes, or other types of garbage in your fireplace.\n• After the holiday season, do not dispose of your Christmas tree by burning it in the fire. The Christmas tree wood has not been properly dried out for burning and may become a fire hazard.\n• Keep a fire extinguisher handy.\nEnjoying the holidays begins with the peace of mind of knowing that your fireplace is safe for your family to use.

23	I'm studying microbiology and I'm confused - can both P. multocida and undefined growth media be considered 'complex'? What's the connection?	Yes, both can be considered complex. An undefined (also called complex) growth medium contains ingredients of unknown exact composition, such as yeast extract or casein hydrolysate. Similarly, P. multocida infections are considered complex due to their polymicrobial nature, requiring treatments that target both aerobic and anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria.	"['Pasteurella multocida is a Gram-negative, nonmotile, penicillin-sensitive coccobacillus belonging to the Pasteurellaceae family. Strains belonging to the species are currently classified into 5 serogroups (A, B, D, E, F) based on capsular composition and 16 somatic serovars (1-16). Pasteurella multocida is the cause of a range of diseases in mammals and birds including fowl cholera in poultry, atrophic rhinitis in pigs and bovine hemorrhagic septicemia in cattle and buffalo. It can also cause a zoonotic infection in humans, which typically is a result of bites or scratches from domestic pets. Many mammals and birds harbor it as part of their normal respiratory microbiota including domestic cats and dogs.\n- See: Pasteurellosis\nP. multocida causes a range of diseases in wild and domesticated animals, as well as humans. The bacterium can be found in birds, cats, dogs, rabbits, cattle and pigs. In birds, P. multocida causes avian or fowl cholera disease;a significant disease present in commercial and domestic poultry flocks worldwide, particularly layer flocks and parent breeder flocks. P. multocida strains that cause fowl cholera in poultry typically belong to the serovars 1, 3 and 4. In the wild, fowl cholera has been shown to follow bird migration routes, especially of snow geese. The P. multocida serotype-1 is most associated with avian cholera in North America, but the bacterium does not linger in wetlands for extended periods of time. P. multocida causes atrophic rhinitis in pigs; it also can cause pneumonia or bovine respiratory disease in cattle. In humans, P. multocida is the most common cause of infection from wound infections after dog/cat-bites. The infection usually shows as soft tissue inflammation within 24 hours. High leukocyte and neutrophil counts are typically observed, leading to an inflammatory reaction at the infection site (generally a diffuse, localized cellulitis). It can also infect other locales, such as the respiratory tract, and is known to cause regional lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph nodes). In more serious cases, a bacteremia can result, causing an osteomyelitis or endocarditis. The bacteria may also cross the blood–brain barrier and cause meningitis.\nVirulence, culturing, and metabolism\nP. multocida expresses a range of virulence factors including a polysaccharide capsule and the variable carbohydrate surface molecule, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The capsule has been shown in strains belonging to serogroups A and B to help resist phagocytosis by host immune cells and capsule type A has also been shown to help resist complement-mediated lysis. The LPS produced by P. multocida consists of a hydrophobic lipid A molecule (that anchors the LPS to the outer membrane), an inner core and an outer core, both consisting of a series of sugars linked in a specific way. There is no O-antigen on the LPS and the molecule is similar to LPS produced by ""Haemophilus influenzae"" and the lipooligosaccharide of ""Neisseria meningitidis"". A study in a serovar 1 strain showed that a full length LPS molecule was essential for the bacteria to be fully virulent in chickens. Strains that cause atrophic rhinitis in pigs are unique as they also have Pasteurella Multocida Toxin (PMT)residing on a bacteriophage. PMT is a toxin that is responsible for the twisted snouts observed in pigs infected with the bacteria. This toxin activates Rho GTPases, which bind and hydrolyze GTP, and are important in actin stress fiber formation. Formation of stress fibers may aid in the endocytosis of P. multocida. The host cell cycle is also modulated by the toxin, which can act as an intracellular mitogen. P. multocida has been observed invading and replicating inside host amoebae, causing lysis in the host. P. multocida will grow at 37°C on blood or chocolate agar, but will not grow on MacConkey agar. Colony growth is accompanied by a characteristic ""mousy"" odor due to metabolic products.\nBeing a facultative anaerobe, it is oxidase-positive and catalase-positive, and can also ferment a large number carbohydrates in anaerobic conditions. The survival of P. multocida bacteria has also been shown to be increased by the addition of salt into their environment. Levels of sucrose and pH also have been shown to have minor effects on bacterial survival.\nDiagnosis and treatment\nDiagnosis of the bacterium in humans was traditionally based on clinical findings, and culture and seriological testing, but false negatives have been a problem due to easy death of P. multocida, and serology cannot differentiate between current infection and previous exposure. The quickest and most accurate method for confirming an active P. multocida infection is molecular detection using PCR. This bacterium can be effectively treated with beta-lactam antibiotics, which inhibit cell wall synthesis. It can also be treated with fluoroquinolones or tetracyclines; fluoroquinolones inhibit bacterial DNA synthesis and tetracyclines interfere with protein synthesis by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. Despite poor in vitro susceptibility results, macrolides (binding to the ribosome) also can be applied, certainly in the case of pulmonary complications. Due to the polymicrobial etiology of P. multocida infections, treatment requires the use of antimicrobials targeted at the elimination of both aerobic and anaerobic, Gram-negative bacteria. As a result, amoxicillin-clavulanate (a beta-lactamase inhibitor/penicillin combination) is seen as the treatment of choice.\nP. multocida mutants are being researched for their ability to cause diseases. In vitro experiments show the bacteria respond to low iron. Vaccination against progressive atrophic rhinitis was developed by using a recombinant derivative of P. multocida toxin. The vaccination was tested on pregnant gilts (female swine without previous litters). The piglets born to treated gilts were inoculated, while the piglets born to unvaccinated mothers developed atrophic rhinitis. Other research is being done on the effects of protein, pH, temperature, NaCl and sucrose on P. multocida development and survival in water. The research seems to show the bacteria survive better in 18°C water compared to 2°C water. The addition of 0.5% salt (NaCl) also aided bacterial survival, while the sucrose and pH levels had minor effects, as well. Ongoing research has also been done on the response of P. multocida to the host environment. These tests use DNA microarrays and proteomics techniques. P. multocida-directed mutants have been tested for their ability to produce disease. Findings seem to indicate the bacteria occupy host niches that force them to change their gene expression for energy metabolism, uptake of iron, amino acids and other nutrients. In vitro experiments show the responses of the bacteria to low iron and different iron sources, such as transferrin and hemoglobin. P. multocida genes that are upregulated in times of infection are usually involved in nutrient uptake and metabolism. This shows true virulence genes may only be expressed during the early stages of infection.\n- Kuhnert P; Christensen H (editors). (2008). Pasteurellaceae: Biology, Genomics and Molecular Aspects.

Different types of media are used for growing different types of cells.\nThe two major types of growth media are those used for cell culture, which use specific cell types derived from plants or animals, and microbiological culture, which are used for growing microorganisms, such as bacteria or fungi. The most common growth media for microorganisms are nutrient broths and agar plates; specialized media are sometimes required for microorganism and cell culture growth. Some organisms, termed fastidious organisms, require specialized environments due to complex nutritional requirements. Viruses, for example, are obligate intracellular parasites and require a growth medium containing living cells.\nThe most common growth media for microorganisms are nutrient broths (liquid nutrient medium) or LB medium (lysogeny broth). Liquid media are often mixed with agar and poured via a sterile media dispenser into Petri dishes to solidify. These agar plates provide a solid medium on which microbes may be cultured. They remain solid, as very few bacteria are able to decompose agar (the exception being some species in the genera: Cytophaga, Flavobacterium, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Alcaligenes). Bacteria grown in liquid cultures often form colloidal suspensions.\nThe difference between growth media used for cell culture and those used for microbiological culture is that cells derived from whole organisms and grown in culture often cannot grow without the addition of, for instance, hormones or growth factors which usually occur in vivo. In the case of animal cells, this difficulty is often addressed by the addition of blood serum or a synthetic serum replacement to the medium. In the case of microorganisms, no such limitations exist, as they are often unicellular organisms. One other major difference is that animal cells in culture are often grown on a flat surface to which they attach, and the medium is provided in a liquid form, which covers the cells. In contrast, bacteria such as Escherichia coli may be grown on solid or in liquid media.\nAn important distinction between growth media types is that of defined versus undefined media. A defined medium will have known quantities of all ingredients. For microorganisms, they consist of providing trace elements and vitamins required by the microbe and especially defined carbon and nitrogen sources. Glucose or glycerol are often used as carbon sources, and ammonium salts or nitrates as inorganic nitrogen sources. An undefined medium has some complex ingredients, such as yeast extract or casein hydrolysate, which consist of a mixture of many chemical species in unknown proportions. Undefined media are sometimes chosen based on price and sometimes by necessity – some microorganisms have never been cultured on defined media.\nA good example of a growth medium is the wort used to make beer. The wort contains all the nutrients required for yeast growth, and under anaerobic conditions, alcohol is produced. When the fermentation process is complete, the combination of medium and dormant microbes, now beer, is ready for consumption. The main types are\n- Cultural media\n- Minimal media\n- Selective media\n- Differential media\n- Transport media\n- Indicator media\nCulture media contain all the elements that most bacteria need for growth and are not selective, so they are used for the general cultivation and maintenance of bacteria kept in laboratory culture collections.\nAn undefined medium (also known as a basal or complex medium) contains:\n- a carbon source such as Glucose\n- various salts\n- a source of amino acids and nitrogen (e.g., beef, yeast extract)\n- This is an undefined medium because the amino-acid source contains a variety of compounds with the exact composition being unknown.\nA defined medium (also known as chemically defined medium or synthetic medium) is a medium in which\n- all the chemicals used are known\n- no yeast, animal, or plant tissue is present\nSome examples of nutrient media include:\nA defined medium that has just enough ingredients to support growth is called a Minimal Medium. The number of ingredients that must be added to a minimal medium varies enormously depending on which microorganism is being grown.Minimal media are those that contain the minimum nutrients possible for colony growth, generally without the presence of amino acids, and are often used by microbiologists and geneticists to grow ""wild-type"" microorganisms. Minimal media can also be used to select for or against recombinants or exconjugants.\nMinimal medium typically contains:\n- a carbon source, which may be a sugar such as glucose, or a less energy-rich source such as succinate\n- various salts, which may vary among bacteria species and growing conditions; these generally provide essential elements such as magnesium, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur to allow the bacteria to synthesize protein and nucleic acids\nSupplementary minimal media are minimal media that also contains a single selected agent, usually an amino acid or a sugar. This supplementation allows for the culturing of specific lines of auxotrophic recombinants.\nSelective media are used for the growth of only selected microorganisms. For example, if a microorganism is resistant to a certain antibiotic, such as ampicillin or tetracycline, then that antibiotic can be added to the medium to prevent other cells, which do not possess the resistance, from growing. Media lacking an amino acid such as proline in conjunction with E. coli unable to synthesize it were commonly used by geneticists before the emergence of genomics to map bacterial chromosomes.\nSelective growth media are also used in cell culture to ensure the survival or proliferation of cells with certain properties, such as antibiotic resistance or the ability to synthesize a certain metabolite. Normally, the presence of a specific gene or an allele of a gene confers upon the cell the ability to grow in the selective medium. In such cases, the gene is termed a marker.\nSelective growth media for eukaryotic cells commonly contain neomycin to select cells that have been successfully transfected with a plasmid carrying the neomycin resistance gene as a marker. Gancyclovir is an exception to the rule, as it is used to specifically kill cells that carry its respective marker, the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV TK).\nExamples of selective media include:\n- Eosin methylene blue contains dyes that are toxic for Gram-positive bacteria. It is the selective and differential medium for coliforms.\n- YM (yeast extract, malt extract agar) has a low pH, deterring bacterial growth.\n- MacConkey agar is for Gram-negative bacteria.\n- Hektoen enteric agar is selective for Gram-negative bacteria.\n- HIS-selective medium is a type cell culture medium that lacks the amino acid histidine.\n- Mannitol salt agar is selective for Gram-positive bacteria and differential for mannitol.\n- Xylose lysine deoxycholate is selective for Gram-negative bacteria.\n- Buffered charcoal yeast extract agar is selective for certain Gram-negative bacteria, especially Legionella pneumophila.\n- Baird–Parker agar is for Gram-positive staphylococci.\n- Sabouraud\'s agar is selective to certain fungi due to its low pH(5.6) and high glucose concentration(3-4%)\nDifferential or indicator media distinguish one microorganism type from another growing on the same medium. This type of media uses the biochemical characteristics of a microorganism growing in the presence of specific nutrients or indicators (such as neutral red, phenol red, eosin y, or methylene blue) added to the medium to visibly indicate the defining characteristics of a microorganism. These media are used for the detection of microorganisms and by molecular biologists to detect recombinant strains of bacteria.\nExamples of differential media include:\n- Blood agar (used in strep tests) contains bovine heart blood that becomes transparent in the presence of β-hemolytic organisms such as Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus.\n- Eosin methylene blue is differential for lactose fermentation.\n- Granada medium is selective and differential for Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) which grows as distinctive red colonies in this medium.\n- MacConkey agar is differential for lactose fermentation.\n- Mannitol salt agar is differential for mannitol fermentation.\n- X-gal plates are differential for lac operon mutants.\nTransport media should fulfill these criteria:\n- Temporary storage of specimens being transported to the laboratory for cultivation\n- Maintain the viability of all organisms in the specimen without altering their concentration\n- Contain only buffers and salt\n- Lack of carbon, nitrogen, and organic growth factors so as to prevent microbial multiplication\n- Transport media used in the isolation of anaerobes must be free of molecular oxygen.\nExamples of transport media include:\n- Thioglycolate broth is for strict anaerobes.\n- Stuart transport medium is a non-nutrient soft agar gel containing a reducing agent to prevent oxidation, and charcoal to neutralize.\n- Certain bacterial inhibitors are used for gonococci, and buffered glycerol saline for enteric bacilli.\n- Venkataraman Ramakrishna (VR) medium is used for V. cholerae\nEnriched media contain the nutrients required to support the growth of a wide variety of organisms, including some of the more fastidious ones. They are commonly used to harvest as many different types of microbes as are present in the specimen. Blood agar is an enriched medium in which nutritionally rich whole blood supplements the basic nutrients. Chocolate agar is enriched with heat-treated blood (40–45 °C), which turns brown and gives the medium the color for which it is named.\n- Cell culture\n- Impedance microbiology\n- Modified Chee\'s medium\n- Madigan M, Martinko J, eds.

24	How does the MMSEV simulate spacewalks and what cargo did Cygnus deliver?	The MMSEV uses a virtual reality lab with head-mounted display and special gloves for EVA simulation, plus the ARGOS facility with crane and winch system for microgravity simulation. The Cygnus spacecraft delivered 7,600 pounds of supplies and scientific experiments to the ISS.	['|Crewmates José Hurtado and Alvin Drew conduct an MMSEV flying simulation.|\nTest-driving a spaceship. That is essentially the mission this week for me and my crewmate, astronaut Alvin Drew. As crew of the new prototype Mult-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle (MMSEV), we are test subjects in an important study of how well the MMSEV serves as a home and as a vehicle for exporing a near-Earth asteroid (NEA). To do that we are living and working in the MMSEV for three days during a simulated mission to a NEA.\nDuring the day, we are kept busy with various tasks such as flying the vehicle, making simulated “spacewalks” or EVAs (extravehicluar activities), and other mission-oriented tasks. These are meant to test the various methods humans might use to explore a NEA. For example, today I did an EVA in the virtual reality lab. With a head-mounted display and special gloves, the lab allows me to experience the first-person view one would have in a spacesuit during a spacewalk. On this EVA, Alvin piloted the MMSEV in the simulation with me on the outside attached to a robotic arm. Our task was to visit a set of six points on the surface of the spinning asteroid using one of several possible stategies. These points could be sites for making scientific observations or for collecting samples. We chose to approach the targets at close range (a few meters) with me on the arm, at which point I would detach, acquire the target, and return to the MMSEV for a ride to the next point. Another EVA I did today was in the ARGOS facility where I practiced some of the types of tasks an astronaut might be doing at a study point on an asteroid. The ARGOS is a crane and winch system designed to suspend a human subject wearing a harness in such a precise manner as to offset their weight, simulating microgravity. In this simulation, I tried various concepts for collecting samples while floating about, including scooping loose material into a bag with a claw, picking up rock fragments with a gloved hand, and hammering pieces of rock off an outcrop. I also tested the use of tethers and lines vs. a rigid arm for anchoring and stability. These are just two of the various scenarios our three days of simulations is testing. The engineers, scientists, and mission planners at NASA are interested in which methods are the most efficient in terms of fuel and time (and hence consumables such as air) and which ones may be best for achieving science and mission objectives.\nWhile we are conducting the mission and evaluating the performance of the vehicle for the exploration tasks, we are also paying close attention to the comfort and usability of the spacecraft as a mobile home. This includes the sleeping quarters, facilities for preparation of food, storage space, hygenie, and even the Waste Collection System (WCS) — our MMSEV toilet. Sleeping in the MMSEV is comfortable, and, with the whirring sounds of electronics and the air handling system, it sounds like the inside of an airliner. You have a little more room to spread out in here than you do on a plane, though! At night we can divide MMSSEV into two private sleep stations separated by the central aisle (and the WCS) and isloated from the cockpit and the suitports. The MMSEV can carry all the food we need on board, and it has a water dispenser/heater for drinking and rehydrating meals. Our mission this week is to live in here for three days (and so far I have few complaints!), but the vehicle is designed to support a two-person crew on missions of two weeks or longer. NASA will use the lessons we are learning this week to make those missions a reality.', 'The Cygnus spacecraft successfully departed the International Space Station three months after arriving at the space station to deliver 7,600 pounds of supplies and scientific experiments to the orbiting laboratory.\nThe Cygnus spacecraft will now remain in orbit until mid-December and coincide with a second Cygnus spacecraft scheduled for launch to the space station in October. This will be the first extended duration flight to demonstrate spacecraft’s capability to fly two Cygnus vehicles simultaneously and support hosted payloads for longer periods of time.\nA U.S. resupply ship is packed and ready to depart the International Space Station on Tuesday. The Expedition 60 crew is also testing the viability of printing organ-like tissue and exploring the impact of microgravity on time perception today.\nNASA astronauts Nick Hague and Christina Koch finished loading and closed the hatches to the Cygnus space freighter from Northrop Grumman today. Hague will lead the robotics activities and command its release from the Canadarm2 on Tuesday at 12:15 p.m. EDT. NASA TV begins its live broadcast of Cygnus’ departure at noon after 109 days at the station.\nThe crew outfitted Cygnus with the SlingShot Deployer that will eject a series of nanosatellites once the spacecraft reaches a safe distance and a higher altitude from the station. Cygnus will continue orbiting Earth for a few more months of systems tests before it reenters the atmosphere above the Pacific Ocean for a fiery demise.\n3-D bioprinting has proven a challenge for scientists on Earth seeking to replicate complex cellular structures. NASA astronaut Andrew Morgan is researching today whether the weightless environment of space may support the fabrication of human organs in space. He set up the station’s new BioFabrication Facility to begin test-printing tissues today. An incubator houses the tissue samples to promote cohesive cellular growth over several weeks.\nFlight Engineer Luca Parmitano of the European Space Agency started Monday collecting his blood samples and stowing them in a science freezer for later analysis. Next, he wore virtual reality goggles for an experiment testing his ability to judge the duration of time. Results are collected before, during and after a spaceflight to understand how time perception is affected in space. The impacts could potentially affect space navigation and other mission-oriented tasks.\nCommander Alexey Ovchinin tested Russian smoke detectors, conducted a fit check of the Soyuz MS-12 crew ship seats and worked on space biology gear. Cosmonaut Alexander Skvortsov checked out video gear then studied how microgravity affects pain sensation.\nThe International Space Station is hosting five spaceships today as August ramps up for more orbital traffic activity. Six Expedition 60 crewmembers are also unloading U.S. and Russian cargo, activating new science experiments and stocking the station’s galley.\nRussia’s Progress 73 (73P) cargo craft completed a fast-track delivery mission early Wednesday docking to the Pirs Docking Compartment just three hours and nineteen minutes after launching from Kazakhstan. Cosmonaut Alexander Skvortsov opened the 73P hatch shortly afterward starting its four-month stay. He and station Commander Alexey Ovchinin then began unloading nearly three tons of new consumables, fuel and supplies.\nTwo U.S. space freighters occupy the station’s Earth-facing Harmony and Unity module ports. Harmony will open up Tuesday when Northrop Grumman’s Cygnus resupply ship departs after 109 days in space. The Canadarm2 robotic arm installed the SpaceX Dragon to Unity on Saturday after its arrival and capture beginning a month of cargo operations.\nNASA astronauts Christina Koch and Nick Hague are tending to mice today shipped aboard Dragon for ongoing biological research. The reusable vehicle will return the mice back to Earth at the end of the month, including other cargo, so scientists can analyze a variety of changes that only occur in microgravity.\nDragon also delivered a new commercial crew vehicle port, the International Docking Adapter-3 (IDA-3), in its unpressurized trunk. Robotics controllers will soon extract the IDA-3 before two spacewalkers install it to Unity’s space-facing port a few days later.\nA few days before Dragon departs, Russia will launch an unpiloted Soyuz MS-14 crew ship to the orbiting lab for a test of its upgraded 2.1a Soyuz booster. It will dock to the Poisk module for a two-week stay before parachuting back to Earth in the vast steppe of Kazakhstan.\nThree Expedition 59 crewmembers are beginning their final week aboard the International Space Station and readying their spacesuits and Soyuz crew ship for the return to Earth. The orbital residents also continued a variety of human research activities amidst the deployment of tiny satellites today.\nFlight Engineers Anne McClain and David Saint-Jacques are set to return to Earth June 24 with Commander Oleg Kononenko at the helm of the Soyuz MS-11 crew craft. The homebound residents checked their Sokol launch and entry suits for leaks today. The trio also tested sensors that will monitor the crew’s blood pressure during reentry into Earth’s atmosphere.\nMcClain also packed personal items she will take back to Earth with her. Kononenko and Saint-Jacques practiced Soyuz descent procedures the crew will use on its way to a landing in Kazakhstan. The threesome have been living aboard the space lab since Dec. 3 and will have accumulated 204 days on orbit when they complete their mission next week.\nScience continues unabated aboard the orbital lab with the crew exploring a wide variety of phenomena to help NASA plan missions to the Moon, Mars and beyond. Payload specialists on the ground also remotely operate many of the hundreds of experiments taking place aboard the orbiting lab.\nFour small satellites, or CubeSats, were ejected this morning outside of Japan’s Kibo laboratory module. Flight Engineer Nick Hague of NASA monitored and photographed the CubeSats deployed for technology demonstrations. The first set of CubeSats deployed were from Nepal, Sri Lanka and Japan as part of the BIRDS-3 mission. The last CubeSat was from Singapore. All four arrived at the station April 19 aboard the Northrop Grumman Cygnus space freighter.\nThree Expedition 59 crewmembers are getting ready to end their stay at the International Space Station after six and a half months in space. Meanwhile, mission scientists continue exploring how microgravity impacts the human body.\nSaint-Jacques and Kononenko began gathering items to take back home inside their Soyuz crew ship. The duo collected personal items such as shoes and clothes as well as tools and trash that will be soon be stowed aboard the Soyuz for the ride to Earth.\nSaint-Jacques also researched ways to supplement crew nutrition during future long-term space missions, such as missions to the Moon and Mars. Food stowed for long periods can lose nutritional value. The BioNutrients-1 study is exploring manufacturing nutritional compounds in space to maintain healthy crews for successful missions.\nNASA astronauts Christina Koch and Nick Hague started Monday morning by drawing blood samples and spinning them in a centrifuge before stowing them in science freezer. Doctors on the ground will analyze the samples to detect critical changes to a crewmember’s physiology while living in space. The pair also participated in visual acuity tests using an eye chart in the afternoon.\nThe Expedition 59 crew is unloading one U.S. cargo ship today and preparing for the arrival of another after it launches from Florida next week. The orbital residents also continued exploring how microgravity impacts the human body and a variety of terrestrial materials.\nAstronauts Christina Koch and David Saint-Jacques worked Wednesday afternoon to offload some of the 7,600 pounds of cargo the Cygnus space freighter delivered last week. Saint-Jacques is also training today to capture the SpaceX resupply ship with the Canadarm2 robotic arm when it arrives next Thursday. Dragon will be the sixth spaceship parked at the station and occupy the Harmony module’s Earth-facing port.\nThe duo also split the day working with a variety of biomedical hardware and research gear to ensure healthy astronauts and successful space research. Koch and Saint-Jacques participated in ultrasound scans for ongoing health checks. Koch then explored the feasibility of manufacturing fiber optic cables in space. Saint-Jacques set up Kubik incubator hardware inside Europe’s Columbus lab module.\nNASA Flight Engineers Anne McClain and Nick Hague were back collecting more blood, urine and saliva samples today. The samples are spun in a centrifuge, stowed in a science freezer then analyzed for the long-running Fluid Shifts study. The experiment seeks to understand and prevent the upward flow of body fluids in space that cause head and eye pressure in astronauts.\nThe Expedition 59 crew spent the majority of Tuesday conducting space experiments and setting up research hardware. The International Space Station residents are also continuing to unpack a pair of recently arrived cargo ships while training for the next U.S. cargo mission.\nThe weightless conditions of microgravity pull fluids towards an astronaut’s head causing a common space phenomenon sometimes called “puffy-face.” Flight Engineer Nick Hague of NASA spent the morning collecting and stowing his blood, urine and saliva samples for the long-running Fluid Shifts study. The research observes and seeks to reverse the upward flow of fluids causing increased head and eye pressure that concerns flight surgeons.\nA new materials exposure experiment is ready for deployment outside Japan’s Kibo lab module. NASA astronaut Anne McClain installed the MISSE-FF gear inside Kibo’s airlock before depressurizing the unit. Robotics controllers will deploy the exposed sample trays outside the airlock. The study will help scientists understand how radiation, the vacuum of space and micrometeoroids affect a variety of materials.\nCanadian Space Agency astronaut David Saint-Jacques is training for his role to capture the next SpaceX Dragon cargo craft. Hague joined him today for the robotics training and will back him up in the cupola. Dragon is scheduled to launch April 30 from Florida and take a two-day trip to the station where it will be grappled with the Canadarm2 robotic arm and installed to the Harmony module.\nCommander Oleg Kononenko helped attach sensors to Flight Engineer Alexey Ovchinin as the duo researched cardiovascular activity during exercise in space. Kononenko went on to replace smoke detectors as Ovchinin worked on life support maintenance.\nThe SpaceX Dragon cargo craft is due to join the five other spacecraft parked at the station after it launches from Florida April 30. Dragon is scheduled to arrive May 2 and Saint-Jacques will command the Canadarm2 robotic arm to reach out and capture the cargo vessel. Dragon will deliver over 5,000 pounds of new science, supplies and hardware to the orbital lab.\nCosmonauts Oleg Kononenko and Alexey Ovchinin stayed focused on the Russian side of the station with their complement of orbital science and lab maintenance. Commander Kononenko updated communications gear, cleaned fans and filters and explored enzyme behaviors. Flight Engineer Ovchinin offloaded cargo from the new Progress 72 resupply ship and studied radiation exposure.\nAfter its capture this morning at 5:28 a.m. EDT, the Northrop Grumman Cygnus spacecraft was bolted into place on the International Space Station’s Earth-facing port of the Unity module at 7:31 a.m. At the time of installation, Cygnus was flying 255 miles above the Indian Ocean just south of Singapore.\nCygnus will remain at the space station until July 23, when the spacecraft will depart the station, deploy NanoRacks customer CubeSats, then have an extended mission of nine months before it will dispose of several tons of trash during a fiery reentry into Earth’s atmosphere.\nThe spacecraft’s arrival brings close to 7,600 pounds of research and supplies to space station. Highlights of NASA-sponsored research to advance exploration goals and enable future missions to the Moon and Mars include:\nModels for growing increasingly complex materials\nAdvanced Colloids Experiment-Temperature-10 (ACE-T-10) will test gels in a microgravity environment. This research could aid in the development of increasingly complex materials that may serve as the building blocks for a range of applications on Earth including foods, drugs, and electronic devices. The process also may provide an efficient method to build new materials and equipment in space.\nBetter life science research in a few drops\nAlthough the space station is well equipped for health and life sciences research, the equipment available for cellular and molecular biology still is limited compared to capabilities found in laboratories on Earth. To address this limitation, CSA designed Bio-Analyzer, a new tool the size of a video game console that astronauts on station easily can use to test body fluids such as blood, saliva, and urine, with just a few drops. It returns key analyses, such as blood cell counts, in just two to three hours, eliminating the need to freeze and store samples.\nAnalyzing aging of the arteries in astronauts\nThe Vascular Aging investigation uses ultrasounds, blood samples, oral glucose tolerance tests, and wearable sensors to study aging-like changes that occur in many astronauts during their stay on the space station. It’s one of three Canadian experiments exploring the effects of weightlessness on the blood vessels and heart, and the links between these effects and bone health, blood biomarkers, insulin resistance, and radiation exposure. Increased understanding of these mechanisms can be used to address vascular aging in both astronauts and the aging Earth population.\nTesting immune response in space\nSpaceflight is known to have a dramatic influence on an astronaut’s immune response, but there is little research on its effect following an actual challenge to the body’s immune system. The rodent immune system closely parallels that of humans, and Rodent Research-12: Tetanus Antibody Response by B cells in Space (TARBIS) will examine the effects of spaceflight on the function of antibody production and immune memory. This investigation aims to advance the development of measures to counter these effects and help maintain crew health during future long-duration space missions. On Earth, it could advance research to improve the effectiveness of vaccines and therapies for treating diseases and cancers.\nBig buzz for new robot\nA fleet of small robots is set to take on big jobs aboard the space station. Building on the success of SPHERES, NASA will test Astrobee, a robotic system comprised of three cube-shaped robots and a docking station for recharging; the first two are aboard Cygnus. The free-flying robots use electric fans for propulsion and cameras and sensors help them navigate their surroundings. The robots also have an arm to grasp station handrails or grab and hold items. Astrobee can operate in automated mode or under remote control from the ground as it assists with routine chores on station, and requires no supervision from the crew. This has the potential to free up astronauts to conduct more research.\nAt 5:28 a.m. EDT, Expedition 59 Flight Engineer Anne McClain of NASA used the International Space Station’s robotic Canadarm2 to grapple the Northrop Grumman Cygnus spacecraft as David Saint-Jacques of the Canadian Space Agency monitored Cygnus systems during its approach. Next, ground controllers will command the station’s arm to rotate and install Cygnus, dubbed the S.S. Roger Chaffee, on the bottom of the station’s Unity module.\nThe station was flying over northeast France at an altitude of 254 miles when it was captured.\nNASA Television coverage of installation will begin at 7 a.m., and installation of the Cygnus spacecraft to the space station is expected to be completed later this morning. Cygnus will remain at the orbiting laboratory for a three-month stay.']	['<urn:uuid:44b9699d-03a6-44bf-b52e-5dcaa4326d7e>', '<urn:uuid:bf30a4d2-3d42-48ee-939a-dec57a5ab504>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	12	42	3156
25	Is Bacillus thuringiensis safe for beneficial insects?	Yes, Bt doesn't harm bees, ladybugs or other beneficial insects and isn't toxic to humans or mammals.	['Producing fragrant blooms and mouth-puckering fruit, lemon trees grow in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 9 through 11. As with other citrus, lemon trees are susceptible to pest problems that can severely reduce fruit production. Starting a pest management program, using various control methods in conjunction with each other, will keep pests from attacking the lemon tree.\nVarious chemical pesticides control infestations of insects and fungal diseases. Acetamiprid is a broad-spectrum insecticide used to control various species of sap-sucking insects that attack fruit trees, vegetables and ornamental plants. Imidacloprid controls both the adult and larval stages of various sap-sucking insects and beetles that attack fruit trees and works by disrupting the insect’s nervous system. Malathion controls sap-sucking and chewing insects, including beetles and moths, and is safe to use on citrus trees such as lemon. Although these chemical pesticides help control insects and disease, they can cause more harm than good. For example, most chemical pesticides will also kill beneficial insects that naturally control unwanted insects. This can lead to more serious pest infestations. Before using chemicals, consider treating the pests with biological and cultural methods, and less toxic pesticides.\nBacillus thuringiensis, known as Bt, is a safer option for controlling the larval stage of moths and butterflies that attack a lemon tree. This includes tent caterpillars, leaf-eating caterpillars, hornworms, leaf rollers, bagworms, webworms and loopers. The larvae must consume the bacteria for Bt to kill them. Once consumed, the larvae cannot feed on the lemon tree and -- within two to four days -- they die of starvation. Bt doesn’t harm bees, ladybugs or other beneficial insects and isn’t toxic to humans or mammals. Like Bt, Spinosad is a bacterium that occurs naturally in the soil. It can kill various insects by either contact or ingestion and is safe to use on citrus trees. Spinosad is used to control caterpillars, thrips, beetles, moths, borers and leaf miners without harming beneficial predators. Even though Spinosad is not toxic to humans or mammals, it can harm bees and shouldn’t be used when bees are active.\nOils and Soaps\nHorticultural oils and insecticidal soaps are generally considered less toxic than chemical pesticides while still providing control and protection from pests. Horticultural oil is typically used as a dormant oil to control overwintering pests and their eggs during the winter, when lemon trees are dormant. Horticultural oil works by smothering the pests and must completely cove the insects to provide proper control. Aphids, mites, mealybugs, scale insects and leafhoppers are a few insects horticultural oil will kill. Containing fatty acids, insecticidal soap is another less toxic pesticide that controls soft-bodied insects that attack lemon trees. Once this insecticide dries, it is no longer effective. This means insecticidal soap won’t leave toxic residue on tree but also might not be as effective as chemical pesticides.\nCultural control consists of properly caring for lemon trees and ensuring you practice good sanitation measures when gardening. Never allow the lemon tree to become water stressed because this will make the fruit tree more susceptible to pests and problems. You should also avoid over-watering a lemon tree because too much water encourages fungal growth and invites insects to the citrus plant. Weeds growing near the tree provide a breeding, hiding and overwintering location for insects. By keeping the area free of weeds, you reduce the possibility of pest infestations. Pests also hide and overwinter under fallen plant debris and leaf litter, so keep the ground free of debris. With due diligence and multiple control methods, you can protect the lemon tree from pest attacks.\n- Purdue University Extension: Using Organic Fungicides\n- Oklahoma State University Cooperative Extension: Home Tree Fruit Production and Pest Management\n- United States Environmental Protection Agency: Acetamiprid Fact Sheet\n- Cornell University Cooperative Extension: Imidacloprid\n- Bonide: Malathion Insect Control Concentrate\n- Missouri Botanical Garden: Bacillus Thuringiensis (Bt) Kurstaki and Israelensis Strains\n- Missouri Botanical Garden: Spinosad\n- Colorado State University Extension: Insect Control: Horticultural Oils\n- Penn State College of Agricultural Sciences: Safer Insecticidal Soap\n- Oklahoma State University Cooperative Extension: Cultural Control Practices\n- Photos.com/Photos.com/Getty Images']	['<urn:uuid:0faf151b-ea66-4abd-bca8-fc96e21cc5ba>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	7	17	686
26	What does the new Army medical device do for injured patients?	The intrathoracic pressure regulation therapy (IPRT) device increases blood pressure and circulation to tissues of the body in ventilated patients who have low blood volumes. It noninvasively decreases intrathoracic pressure leading to an increase in blood circulation, and is beneficial for patients with compromised blood flow from shock, high pressure in the brain, and other low-perfusion conditions.	"['By Jose E. Rodriguez, AMEDDC&S HRCoENovember 19, 2018\nCAMP BULLIS, Texas -- The U.S. Army continuously look to new technologies and test new devices to increase battlefield survival rates. Recently the U.S. Army Medical Department Board conducted a test on an intrathoracic pressure regulation therapy (IPRT) device that researches hope will help save lives of the critically injured.\nThe IPRT device increases blood pressure and circulation to tissues of the body in ventilated patients who have low blood volumes. Cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, the IPRT noninvasively decreases intrathoracic pressure leading to an increase in blood circulation. It is beneficial for patients who have compromised blood flow from shock, high pressure in the brain, and other low-perfusion conditions. The IPRT appartus is connected to the breathing circuit of a ventilated patient, and it is beneficial for patients who have compromised blood flow from shock, high pressure in the brain, and other low-perfusion conditions.\nSgt. 1st Class Jacob Horspool assigned to the AMEDD Center and School, Health Readiness Center of Excellence in the AMEDD Board, served as thenoncommissioned officer in charge of the test. ""The device draws blood back into the heart and lungs while at the same time decreasing pressure in the brain that caused swelling,"" said Horspool. ""If a patient has a good pair of lungs we can use this device to bring blood back without having to add additional fluids that can water down the blood,"" He continued.\nSoldiers from various Army medical units served as test players during the operational test in a simulated real world deployment scenario. For the test, the AMEDD board brought in potential IPRT users; a pulmonary disease officer, emergency medicine physician, physician assistant, nurses, combat medics, operating room specialists, paramedic/aero MEDEVAC specialists, and respiratory specialists. Conducting the test at Camp Bullis allowed the team to use the device on various power sources within a combat support hospital and aboard field ambulances.\nChief Warrant Officer 2 Goldie Cooper assisted with the tests and is also assigned to the AMEDD Board. Cooper said that getting the mechanism field tested is an important first step to getting them purchased and added to the Army inventory. He stressed that operational testing is where the Army identifies whether the device is suitable for use in an operational environment. It is estimated that 90 percent of potentially survivable deaths (approximately 1,080) in Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom were caused by hemorrhage and hemorrhagic shock. Spanning all documented wars, hemorrhage and hemorrhagic shock have been the leading causes of service personnel killed in action. Cooper said, ""Ultimately it\'s about survival rates, and restoring lives on the battlefield. Every minute is valuable when we\'re trying to save lives.""\nOnce the testing is complete, the AMEDD Board test team prepares a summary report that assesses the IPRT\'s suitability and effectiveness. The device will go through several reviews to ensure it will meet the Army\'s needs prior to approval and deployment.\nTo learn more about the AMEDD Board or other HRCoE initiaves visit http://www.cs.amedd.army.mil/.']"	['<urn:uuid:6dd9aaad-d75c-43aa-8f27-9582751a3cf1>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	11	57	504
27	yellow fever vaccine requirements international travel	Yellow fever vaccine is crucial for international travel to both South America and Africa. The vaccine provides protection from this mosquito-transmitted viral disease that occurs in tropical regions. Travelers receive an international certificate of vaccination valid for 10 years, and some countries require proof of yellow fever vaccination for entry, particularly when entering from countries where yellow fever frequently occurs.	['Health Tips for Travel in South America\nSouth America presents unique health challenges to travelers from North America and Europe. In addition to unfamiliar diseases travelers also have to deal with a number of other health concerns such as food and water safety, different climate conditions and altitude sickness. While it is easy to become overly concerned about your health when traveling in South America, it is accurate information and not exaggerated precautions that will help you stay healthy on your trip.\nPrepare Before You Go\nThe more you learn about the health risks at your destination, the better you will be prepared to stay healthy. Find out about illnesses and health threats in the South American countries you plan to visit. Most health risks for travelers come from a number of diseases we are unfamiliar with and therefore have no experience of how to prevent them.\nBring an updated international immunization record that also lists health conditions and allergies, which can help you get the right medical treatment, if necessary. If you take prescription medication, bring a supply large enough to last you for your trip. If you wear glasses or contact lenses, bring a spare pair, or write down the prescription to be able to get a replacement easily. You should also consider bringing your favorite brands of non-prescription medications, since you might not be able to find them in South America.\nThe best way to prepare medically for a trip is to arrive in good health. Seeing a doctor in a foreign country can be a challenge because of the language barrier and the uncertainty that comes with seeking medical help abroad. See a doctor or a visit a travel clinic at least one month before your departure in order to determine what boosters or immunizations you will need.\nCommon Health Problems\nIt usually takes some time for your body to adapt to the different bacteria in food and initial digestive problems such as diarrhea or constipation are fairly common. These symptoms should go away after a few days. Infections caused by insect bites, small cuts and wounds are also quite common. It is best to treat such small injuries with much more care than you would at home. If your wound does get infected most are easily treated with antibiotics. Below I have listed the most common diseases travelers should beware of in South America:\nTraveler’s Diarrhea is common among foreigners who are just getting used to the different bacteria contained in food. However travelers’ diarrhea usually subsides by itself after a few days. If the condition persists longer than a few days or worsens, you should see a doctor.\nMalaria is a parasitic disease that affects the liver. It is transmitted by the bite of the infected female anopheles mosquito. For short-term stays in areas with a malaria threat it is recommended that you take prophylactic drugs. It is best to bring a supply large enough to last for the period of potential exposure. But keep in mind that malaria is only present in tropical South America and is very rare in urban areas. The best malaria protection is to prevent mosquito bites. Use mosquito netting and wear long-sleeve clothing in the evenings and early mornings, in addition to mosquito repellent.\nDengue Fever is a viral disease, common in tropical areas across South America, and it is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Dengue occurs most commonly in urban areas, especially during the rainy season. Since there is no vaccine, the only way to lower your risk is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes during the day.\nYellow Fever is a viral disease that can cause liver problems. It is transmitted by mosquitoes and occurs mainly in the Amazon region. Since a vaccine is available, you should not take any risks and get an immunization. You will be issued an international certificate of vaccination, which is valid for 10 years. Make sure you take it with you. Free yellow fever immunization is available in Brazil at local vaccination posts throughout the Amazon, at vaccination posts along bus routes to the Amazon, and at airports with flights to the Amazon region. Some countries require a Yellow Fever vaccination when entering from a neighboring country where Yellow Fever is know to frequently occur.\nChagas Disease is a serious disease present in most of South America. It is caused by a parasite transmitted by contact with the feces of a reduviid beetle (also known as kissing bug), a brown oval-shaped beetle. The beetle occurs mostly in rural areas. Bed netting can help prevent infection.\nRabies is a viral disease transmitted by bites from infected animals. Rabies cases from dog bites are decreasing in South America, but there is growing rabies risk from the bites of vampire bats. If you plan on staying in remote rural areas you might want to consider getting a pre-exposure rabies vaccination.\nHepatitis is a viral disease that affects the liver. Hepatitis A is transmitted by consuming contaminated food and water, or by person-to person contact. Be especially aware of unsanitary conditions, where the transmission of the disease is much more likely. An active vaccine is now available. Hepatitis B is transmitted by bodily fluids, and an immunization is also available, Hepatitis C, which is transmitted by blood and through sexual contact, is the most serious type of hepatitis. It is often only diagnosed in the advanced stage, when it causes liver cancer and cirrhosis.\nTuberculosis is a bacterial infection that most frequently affects the lungs. It is transmitted through the air by coughing, or through unpasteurized milk or milk products. Tuberculosis is on the rise worldwide and treatment-resistant strains have recently emerged. If you suspect that you might have been exposed you should get a tuberculin skin test to determine if you have been infected.\nTyphoid Fever is a serious bacterial disease transmitted through contaminated food and water. Although typhoid vaccination is not completely effective, you should add it to your immunization list, especially if you intend to travel in rural and remote areas.\nAIDS is caused by the HIV virus and is transmitted through blood and sexual intercourse. It is estimated that nearly two million people in South America are currently infected with HIV. The highest number of HIV infections is among men who have sex with other men, but heterosexual women are also increasingly affected. Female sex workers also have a higher risk of contracting the virus, and since prostitution and sex tourism are present in South America, foreign travelers should take special precautions.\nWhile this list of common diseases may sound discouraging, keep in mind that most visitors to South America have few health problems. If you take common precautions and are aware of the most common health risks, you will most likely not have any serious health problems.\nSanitary conditions vary drastically from country to country, but it is a good idea to be concerned about water and food safety throughout South America. Numerous diseases and germs are food-borne, and it is important to adapt your sanitary practices to the tropics where germs are more abundant. Wash your hands often and always before you eat. Hygiene standards at restaurants vary a lot, and a more expensive restaurant is not automatically a guarantee for food safety. Pick a restaurant with a high turnover, which is the best assurance that the food is safe. You should be especially careful with street vendors and roadside food stalls. If you eat raw fruits or vegetables, make sure they are peeled or washed in purified water. Be careful with seafood, especially shellfish, and with lightly cooked meat dishes. Food should be cooked thoroughly and served hot. Avoid unpasteurized dairy products.\nThe most common health problem I have had in South America is food poisoning. At one time in La Paz, Bolivia, I was in bed for a week, and I was ready to call a doctor when my condition finally improved. It is mostly in rural areas, where sanitation is not always up to standard, and the chances of catching a food-borne disease are greater. If you drink unfiltered water in rural areas you should get tested for intestinal parasites after you return home. You might want to bring water purification tablets, or a portable water filter, in case you travel to areas where no purified water is available. Tap water in cities and towns is usually treated, but you should avoid drinking unfiltered tap water. Avoid ice cubes as well, unless you know that they are made from purified water.\nThere are also several environmental factors that can impact travelers’ health and it is important to correctly assess your own health. Are you sensitive to intense sunlight, humidity, or certain allergens? Does a rapid change in altitude affect you? You should keep these factors in mind when planning a trip to South America.\nIf you arrive in tropical South America from a temperate climate zone, be prepared to make adjustments to the heat. Seasons are reversed in the southern hemisphere, which intensives the effect of the heat and sun, if you travel there during the northern winter. Give your body time to adjust to the different climate, and drink a lot of water. Use sunglasses, sunscreen, as well as a hat to protect yourself from the effects of the tropical sun. It is best to use a sunscreen lotion with sun protection factor 30 or above. Remember to drink a lot of fluids.\nMany low-lying areas of tropical South America are very humid, which also takes some time to get used to. Let your body gradually adjust to the humidity and stay in a hotel with air conditioning. A sudden change in altitude from the lowlands up to the Andean high plateau often causes altitude sickness, due to the lower oxygen levels in high-altitude air. Although prescription drugs for altitude sickness are available, I have found that slowly traveling up the Andes works equally well, if you have extra time. If possible choose a destination halfway up the mountains and spend a few days there before ascending to your final destination. Coca tea, widely available and legal in Peru and Bolivia, is said to reduce the effects of altitude sickness.\nTo give you an idea of the elevation gain, if you arrive from either the Pacific coast (Lima, Peru’s capital is at sea level) or the Amazon basin (average elevation: 300 ft.) I have listed several destinations in the Andes and their altitude:\n- Cuzco (Peru):11,152 feet.\n- Arequipa (Peru):7,550 ft.\n- Puno (Peru, Lake Titicaca): 12,549 ft.\n- Copacabana (Lake Titicaca, Bolivia): 12,500 ft.\n- La Paz (Bolivia): 13,250 ft.\n- Cochabamba (Bolivia): 8,432 ft.\n- Quito (Ecuador): 9,350 ft.\nGetting Medical Help Abroad\nIf you develop a minor health problem keep in mind that across South America you can buy many prescription medications over the counter, and pharmacists often give health advice. If you decide to see a doctor, it is worth finding out about the local public health system. South American countries have a basic public health system where the locals as well as foreigners can see a doctor or nurse at a very low cost. If you prefer a private doctor or hospital, your consulate should be able to make recommendations, or you could ask at a pharmacy, your hotel, or the tourist information. It is a good idea to learn a few phrases in the local language about your health condition beforehand so you can tell the doctor about your problem. Payment is usually expected at the time of the consultation, even if doctor’s visits are included in your health insurance at home or your travel health insurance. Make sure you get an invoice or proof of payment listing the health condition and treatment, so you can be reimbursed after your return home.\nTo learn more about health concerns in South America, please visit our Health, Safety, and Insurance for Travelers and Expatriates Abroad section.', 'What Vaccines Do You Need to Travel to Africa?\nIf you are planning a trip to Africa, it is crucial to take necessary precautions to ensure your health and safety. One of the most important steps is to get the required vaccines before your departure. Africa is a diverse continent with various regions, each presenting unique health risks.

28	What are some ways to use soundproof curtains for reducing noise from industrial equipment, and how much noise reduction can each method achieve?	There are four main ways to use soundproof curtains for industrial noise reduction: 1) Treating the room by hanging curtains around it, which can reduce noise by 6-9 decibels (30-40% decrease in loudness), 2) Treating the wall behind the equipment, which can reduce noise by 1-2 decibels for general noise or 4-6 decibels if noise is directed at the wall, 3) Building a barrier wall or partial enclosure, which can achieve 6-15 decibels reduction, and 4) Building a complete noise enclosure with four walls and a roof, which can reduce noise by up to 15-20 decibels.	['High noise levels can cause many problems such as poor communication, unhealthy work environment, hearing loss, unhappy employees, OSHA violations. Whether you work in an office or the shop floor, there are always some type of unwanted noise that disrupts the workplace. That’s where soundproof curtains can help.\nUsing soundproof curtains can reduce the noise from noisy equipment and processes. The term “soundproof curtains” is a laymen’s term for the product. The technical name is “sound curtains” or “sound blankets.” HVAC equipment, air compressors, vacuum pumps and process noise can be improved by using these curtains.\n“Soundproof” Curtains – Do They Actually Work?\nMany types of equipment or processes make extremely loud noise like plastic grinders, Positive displacement blowers, stamping presses. Because of the sound frequency on high sound levels this equipment emits, sound curtains will not completely eliminate all the noise being generated, but they can certainly make the environment better with the installation.\nHow Noise Reducing Curtains Work\nSoundproofing curtains are also called Acoustic Drapes, Acoustic Curtains, Soundproof Blankets, Sound Blankets, Sound Screens, Acoustic Barriers, Acoustic Drapes, Acoustic Screens.\nThe curtains are designed and made with materials specifically used for sound control. The curtains are sound absorbers that reduce the reflected sound bouncing around a room. Also, the Soundproofing curtains are sound barrier s cutting down the noise from entering a space.\nAcoustic curtains have shown to reduce the transmission of sound by up to 29db. The performance may vary based on the quality of materials used and your specific application. The reduction in noise is useful in many locations, like theaters, churches, offices, and even as an enclosure for loud industrial machinery. Acoustical curtains are made with difference facings and internal components depending on what environment they will be used in.\nTypically 1 to 4 inches thick, the Soundproofing blankets are manufactured of acoustical grade quilted fiberglass absorber in one or multiple layers with a sewn facing diamond stitched. The curtains may included a ½ to 2 pound sound barrier that is reinforced or non-reinforced. The blankets have all edges bound with industrial grade Velcro on the vertical edges and grommets across the top for suspension.\nMass or weight blocks noise, so thick and heavy materials are used to enhance the performance of the blankets.\nIndustrial Soundproofing Curtains\nThis type of soundproofing curtains are made from very rugged materials to stand up to heavy abuse of the industrial or construction environments. A heavy vinyl or VCP are used for the blanket facings and loaded vinyl sound barriers that replaced lead sheets add superior sound blocking to the blankets. The acoustic soundproof curtains can be made into enclosures around noisy equipment or separate an entire noisy area of the industrial plant.\nInstalling a soundproof curtain enclosures around loud equipment like pumps, generators, compressors vacuum pumps, and dust collectors will make the workplace more tolerable for employees.\nAlso, where heavy commercial construction site is located near residential neighborhoods or in a densely populated city, noise of earth-moving equipment, jackhammers, and heavy trucks. The construction site is will be surrounded by soundproof curtain fence. This will greatly reduce the noise reaching the nearby homes.\nHow to Use Soundproofing Curtains to Quiet Noisy Industrial Equipment\nTreat the Room with Sound Proofing Curtains\nThis is done by hanging a specific amount of soundproof curtains around the room to reduce reflected noise. The maximum noise reduction is 6-9 decibels (30-40% decrease in loudness). The advantages are no inconvenience to workers. The disadvantages is that almost all of the room must be treated regardless of the size of the noise source.\nTreat the Wall Behind the Noisy Industrial Equipment with Sound Proofing Curtains\nThis is down by hanging sound proofing curtains on the wall behind the equipment The maximum noise reduction is 1-2 decibels if noise source sprays noise out into room, 4-6 decibels if noise is sprayed directly onto wall (such as noisy vent on the back of a machine). The advantages are no inconvenience to workers. The recommended amount of Sound proofing curtain to add to the wall behind the machine is approximately twice the square footage of the “noise shadow” of the machine on the wall.\nBuild a Barrier Wall or Partial Enclosure with Sound Proofing Curtains\nThis is done by installing a ceiling hung or floor mounted frame with sound proofing curtains. The maximum noise reduction is 6-15 decibels. Advantages are a very good reduction of noise. You may need to incorporate view windows for visibility and/or sliding panels for access. What Size do I make the soundproof curtain wall? At a minimum, 8′ high. Typically, the barrier should be double the height of the noise source.\nBuild a Complete Noise Enclosure with Sound Proofing Curtains.\nThis is done by erecting a ceiling suspended or floor mounted frame with four walls and a roof constructed of sound curtains. Typical noise reduction of up to 15- 20 decibels. The advantages are to achieve the maximum noise reduction possible. You may be required to incorporate view windows for visibility and/or sliding panels for access as well as ventilation baffle(s) for air flow for cooling the motor.\nThe Pros and Cons of Soundproof Curtains\nSoundproof curtains offer several benefits to industrial and construction sites that can help control the noise, however, there are a few things to consider before you make a purchase. If you are unsure if they can help you, then let’s look at both the pros and cons.\n- They reduce exterior and interior sound transmission and reverberation.\n- They provide a thermal barrier keeping heat or air conditioning inside.\n- They provide a light barrier\n- Soundproof curtains are durable\n- The sound proof curtains are heavy and will require adequate structure for support.\n- They are industrial looking with the quilted facings and though they are functional, are not pleasing to the eye.']	['<urn:uuid:73c45f5b-8958-4dd8-906e-f6ea2bae3b64>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	23	96	975
29	What methods exist for herbicide application and incorporation?	Herbicides can be applied as early preplant (EPP), preplant incorporated (PPI), or preemergence (PRE) surface applications, requiring 1/2 to 1 inch of precipitation within 7-10 days. They can also be applied pre-sowing, pre-emergence, post-emergence, directed application between crop rows, or as band application only over crop rows.	"[""Issue No. 6, Article 4/May 4, 2007\nEffectiveness of Soil-Applied Herbicides\nSoil-applied herbicides remain an important part of weed management programs in corn and soybean production systems. Early preplant (EPP), preplant incorporated (PPI), and preemergence (PRE) surface are the most common types of herbicide applications to soil. EPP applications are typically made several weeks prior to planting and are more common in corn fields than soybean fields. PPI applications were once very common, but they have declined in recent years with the adoption of conservation tillage systems. PRE applications are generally made within 1 week of crop planting. Regardless of when or how a herbicide is applied to the soil, the effectiveness of soil-applied herbicides is influenced by several factors.\nIn order for a soil-applied herbicide to be effective, the herbicide needs to be available for uptake by the weed seedling (usually before the seedling emerges, but some soil-applied herbicides can control small emerged weeds under certain conditions). Processes such as herbicide adsorption to soil colloids or organic matter can reduce the amount of herbicide available for weed absorption. Soil-applied herbicides do not prevent weed seed germination; rather, they are first absorbed by the root or shoot of the seedling and then exert their phytotoxic effect. Generally, this happens before the seedling emerges from the soil. For a herbicide to be absorbed by weed seedlings, the herbicide must be in the soil solution or vapor phase (i.e., an available form).\nHow is this achieved? The most common methods for herbicides to become dissolved into the soil solution are by mechanical incorporation or precipitation. EPP applications in no-till systems attempt to increase the likelihood that sufficient precipitation will be received before planting to incorporate the herbicide. If, however, no precipitation is received between application and planting, mechanical incorporation (where feasible) will in most instances adequately move the herbicide into the soil solution. Herbicide that remains on a dry soil surface following application may not provide much effective weed control and is subject to various dissipation processes, some of which are described in subsequent paragraphs.\nMany weed species, in particular small-seeded species, germinate from fairly shallow depths in the soil. The top 1 to 2 inches of soil is the primary zone of weed seed germination and should thus be the target area for herbicide placement. Shallow incorporation can be achieved by mechanical methods or precipitation. Which method is more consistent? Precipitation provides for a fairly uniform incorporation, but mechanical incorporation reduces the absolute dependence on receiving timely precipitation. How much precipitation is needed and how soon after application it should be received for optimal herbicide performance depends on many factors, but generally ½ to 1 inch of precipitation within 7 to 10 days after application is sufficient.\nHerbicides remaining on the soil surface, or those placed too deeply in the soil, may not be intercepted by the emerging weed seedlings. Herbicides on the soil surface are subjected to several processes that reduce their availability. Volatility (the change from a liquid to gaseous state) and photolysis (degradation due to absorption of sunlight) are two common processes that can reduce the availability of herbicides remaining on the soil surface. Volatility potential is determined by several soil properties and properties of the herbicide formulation, while photolysis is dependent primarily on herbicide properties.\nDry soil conditions are conducive for planting but may also reduce the effectiveness of soil-applied herbicides. If herbicide applications are made prior to planting and no precipitation is received between application and planting, a shallow mechanical incorporation before planting may help preserve much of the herbicide's effectiveness.--Aaron Hager"", 'Damages caused by Weeds\n|Previous Page||Home Page||Next Page|\nDamages caused by weeds\nWeeds are harmful in many ways. The damages caused by them are as under: 1. Reduction in crop yield:- Weeds compete with crops for water, nutrients and light. Being hardy and vigorous in growth habit, they grow faster then crops and consume large amount of water and nutrients, thus causing heavy losses in yields.\n2. Increase in the cost of cultivation:- Tillage operations are done to control weeds and it is generally estimated that on an average about 30 percent of the total expenditure for crop production is on tillage operations and more labour is employed for weeding. This results in increasing cost of cultivation and reducing the margin of net profit. 3. The quality of field produce is reduced:- When the crop is harvested from a weedy field the seeds of weeds get mixed with the main crop which results in lowering the quality of the produce .e.g. seeds of weeds in wheat, gram etc. Similarly, bundles of many leafy vegetables like methi or palak contain green plants of weeds. They fetch lower prices in the market. 4. The quality of the livestock products is reduced. Certain weeds eg. Hulhul when eaten by milch cattle impart an undesirable flavour to milk. Similarly weeds like gokhru get attached to the body of the sheep and impair the quality of wool. Certain poisonous weeds like Datura may cause death of cattle if they are unknowingly eaten by cattle. 5. Weeds harbour insect, pests and diseases:- Weeds either give shelter to various insects, pests and diseases or serve as alternate hosts. 6. Weeds check the flow of water:- Weeds block drainage and check the flow of water in irrigation channels and field channels thereby increasing the seepage losses as well as losses through overflowing. The irrigation efficiency is also reduced. 7. Weed secretions are harmful:- Heavy growth of certain weeds like quack grass or motha lower the germination and reduce the growth of many crop plants. This is said to be due to the presence of certain phytotoxins in these weeds. 8. Weeds are harmful to human beings:- certain weeds cause irritation of skin, allergy and poisoning in human beings. 9. Weeds cause quicker wear and tear of farm implements; they get worn out early and cannot work efficiently unless they are properly sharpened or mended. 10. Weeds reduce the value of the land:- Agricultural lands which are heavily infested with perennial weeds like kans always fetch less price, because such lands can not be brought under cultivation without incurring heavy expenditure on labour and machinery.\nWeed control Methods\nBefore adopting an appropriate method for effective control of weeds, it is essential to know about the weed seeds dispersal, mode of propagation, crop-weed competition. Nature has provided weeds either a number of devices that help them to be disseminated widely. The agents which help the dispersal of weed seeds far and wide are water, wind and animals including man. Other means are impure seeds, sewage, sludge, organic manures, agricultural implements, birds, drainage water. The weed control methods can be broadly classified as preventive and control methods. Preventive measures include all such measures through which the introduction of weeds into the crop fields could be avoided. Control methods include ways of their control and eradication after they have grown in the crop field.\nSince weeds multiply at a much faster rate and are hardier than crop plants, they always have an upper hand if they are allowed to establish in the field. Therefore, it is difficult and costly to eradicate them. The preventive measures are: i) Use clean seeds which free from weed seeds. ii) Use-well decomposed cow-dung or compost. iii) Cut weeds before seeding. iv) Remove weed growth.\nThey are classified as: 1. Mechanical methods 2. Cropping or cultural methods 3. Biological methods 4. Chemicals methods\n1 Mechanical Method\nThe most common ones are hand pulling, hand weeding, burning, flooding, ploughing, and harrowing etc. Pulling the weeds by hand or with the help of sickle is the oldest and most efficient method. Weeds can be easily uprooted after a good soaking irrigation or rain. This method is costly and time consuming.\n2 Cropping or cultural methods\nThese include proper crop rotations so that neither annual nor perennial weeds have a free growth. Continuous cropping with the same cropping system leads to greater infestation of fallow helps in controlling the weeds effectively. Intertilled crops like cotton and crops like potato / groundnut which necessarily require digging of soil help in reducing the infestation of weeds. Growing crops like sannhemp which have a very vigorous and leafy growth help in smothering the weeds. A suitable combination of mechanical methods and crop rotation is very effective method of weed control.\n3.Biological Methods of weed control\nPlant or animal enemies of the weeds maybe used for their destruction. The most notable example is control of prickly pear by using cochineal insects. The Kans grass is controlled by growing basket grass, the roots of which are supposed to excrete substances inhibitory to Kans. Presently, the biological control of weed is including the use of plant pathogens, nematodes, parasitic plants and other organisms. Biological methods have been found to be very efficient and economical provided right type of predators, which even under starvation conditions will not feed upon cultivated crop are found out and introduced.\n4. Chemical method of weed control\nAny chemical that kills the plants or inhibits their growth is known as herbicide and the method of its application is called chemical method of weed control. Such chemicals may be classified as:) selective herbicides, and ii) Non-Selective herbicides. Each group is further divided into two groups viz. foliage applied herbicides are again grouped into two categories viz. contact & Tran located herbicides. Non-selective herbicides are those chemicals which kill the entire vegetation of the treated area and hence they are applied only on waste lands like canal banks, roadsides etc. Selective herbicides:- such chemicals kill only those plants for whom they have selectivity. They are as under:\nA) Foliage applied herbicides:-\nThese chemical are applied over the leaves or green foliage. They are: a) Contact herbicides: - They kill the plant parts which come in contact with the applied chemical. Weed killing efficiency depends upon their concentration, uniformity in coverage of spraying, stage of weed, weather conditions eg. Dicryl, potassium cynate, sodium arsenite. b) Translocated herbicides:- Such chemicals are absorbed by the treated foliage. When sprayed, they are translocated to the roots which are later destroyed. These are best for perennial weeds. They are also known as systemic herbicides eg. 2-4 D.\nB) Soil applied herbicides:-\nThey are used to keep the field completely free from plant growth. a) Soil fumigants:- They form vapour or gas and diffuse through soils. When applied, they kill all the plant growth. They have relatively short stability of few weeks after which the crop seed may be sown or planted in the treated field eg. Carbon-disulphide, methyl bromide. b) Soil Sterilants:- Such chemicals sterilize the soil and make it unfit for any vegetation for varying period of time depending on the nature and dose of the chemical used, soil type, organic matter content of the soil, rainfall etc. eg. Simazine and Atrazine.\nC) Aquatic Applications:-\nSuch chemicals are used by dissolving or emulsifying in water bodies viz canals, ditches, ponds, lakes etc. to control submerged aquatic weeds. eg. Aqualin, Endothal. Methods of herbicide application i) Pre-sowing treatment:- Application of herbicide before sowing or planting of the crop. ii) Pre-emergence treatment:- In this method, the herbicide is applied after sowing or planting of the crop but before the emergence of the crop. iii) Post emergence treatment:- In this method herbicide is applied after full emergence of crop plants. iv) Directed application:- In widely spaced row crop, the herbicides are sprayed over the space left between the rows without treating the crop foliage or crop shoots. Non selective herbicides are applied in this method. v) Band application:- In this method the herbicides are sprayed only over the crop rows and the inter row spaces can be given. Mechanical treatment. This method is adopted for expensive herbicides, which may not be used for overall application due to high costs. Normally soil applied herbicides are applied in this case.\nMatch the followings: A B i) Mechanical Method a) Form vapour or gas in soil ii) Biological b) Systemic Herbicides iii) Contact Herbicide c) hand Pulling iv) Translocated Herbicide d) Kill all the plants part v) Soil Fumigants e) Cochineal Insects\nWhat you have learnt\nA weed is a plant growing where it is not desired. They not only compete with crop plants for plant nutrients, moisture, space and sunlight but also interfere with agricultural operations increasing the cost of labour and tillage. And ultimately affect the yields and quality of farm produce adversely. Weed control methods are classified as preventive and control methods. Control methods are further classified as Mechanical, cropping or cultural method, Biological methods and chemical methods. Any chemical that kills the plants or inhibits their growth is called herbicide. These herbicides are classified as selective and non selective herbicides.\ni) Define weed and write the characteristics of weeds. ii) Write the damages caused by the weeds. ii) Write the control methods of weeds iv) Write the methods of application of herbicides. v) Write about the selective and non-selective herbicides for Weed Control\nAnswer to intext Questions\n7.1 1) One season to complete life cycle 2) Two season to complete life cycle 3) More than two years 4) Doob 7.2 i) Hand pulling ii) Cochineal insects iii) Kill all the plant parts iv) Systemic herbicides v) Form vapour or gas in soil Suggested activity Prepare weed album of different weeds occurring in crop plants.\n|Previous Page||Home Page||Next Page|']"	['<urn:uuid:1239b453-1792-4720-8ee8-e9d7baba3f97>', '<urn:uuid:6db9a4bc-eca9-4a21-bcba-bcbbdb23efd9>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	8	47	2234
30	fisheries expert seeking net sensor capabilities environmental effects	Modern trawl nets use sensors along the headrope to monitor net depth, shape, tangles, bottom distance, and fish entry. However, this technology's environmental impact is significant - studies show that intensive trawling severely reduces organic matter by 52% in seafloor sediments, decreases organic carbon consumption by 37%, and destroys delicate deep-sea ecosystems, with recovery potentially taking years or decades, particularly in depths below 500 meters.	"['NOAA Teacher at Sea\nAboard NOAA ship Oscar Dyson\nJuly 23 – August 10\nMission: Pollock research cruise\nGeographical area of the cruise: Bering Sea\nDate: Sunday, August 5, 2012\nLatitude: 61º 10′ N\nLongitude: 179º 28’W\nShip speed: 4.3 knots ( 4.9 mph)\nWeather Data from the Bridge\nAir temperature: 11.1ºC (52ºF)\nSurface water temperature: 8.1ºC (46.6ºF)\nWind speed: 5.4 knots ( 6.2 mph)\nWind direction: 270ºT\nBarometric pressure: 1013 millibar ( 1.0 atm)\nScience and Technology Log:\nSo far, you have learned a lot about the pollock research we conduct on board. You have learned:\n- How to age fish (with otoliths)\n- How to measure fish (with the Ichthystick)\n- How to identify fish gender (with your eyes!)\nNow, we are going to backtrack a bit to the two big-picture topics that remain:\n- How do we CATCH the pollock (hint hint, that is today’s topics… NETS!)\n- How do we even find pollock in the Bering Sea (that is the next blog’s focus: acoustics!)\nSo, to begin, there are several types of nets we are carrying on board. Remember, when a net is dragged behind a ship in the water it is called trawling, and the net can be considered a trawl. The most-used is the Aleutian Wing Trawl, or AWT, which we use to sample the mid-water column (called a midwater trawl). We are also using a net called the 83-112, which is designed to be dragged along the ocean floor as a bottom trawl, but we are testing it for midwater fishing instead. In fact, sometimes during my shift we do one AWT trawl, and immediately turn around and go over the same area again with the 83-112 to see differences in the fish sizes we catch!\nIf the 83-112, which is a smaller net, proves to be adequate for midwater sampling, NOAA hopes it can be used off of smaller vessels for more frequent sampling, especially in the years the NOAA does not conduct the AWT (NOAA currently does AWT surveys biennially).\nNow, for each type of net, there is some new vocabulary you should know:\nThe codend is the bottom of the net. A closed codend keeps the fish inside the net and an open cod end allows them to swim through. It may seem odd, but yes, sometimes scientists do keep the codend open on purpose! They do this with a camera attached to the net, and they simply record the numbers of fish traveling through a certain area in a certain time period, without actually collecting them! Here on the Dyson, the NOAA team is testing that exact type of technology with a new underwater camera called the Cam-Trawl, and you will learn about it in a later post.\nThe headrope is the top of the opening of the net.\nThe footrope is the bottom of the opening of the net.\n(The 83-112 is called such because it has an 83 ft headrope and an 112 ft footrope.)\nThe trawl doors are in front of the headrope and help keep the net open. Water pressure against the trawl doors pushes them apart in the water column during both setting of the net and while trawling, and this helps spread out the net so it maintains a wide mouth opening to catch fish.\nThere are floats on the top of the net and there can be weights on the bottom of the net to also help keep it open.\nLastly, the mesh size of the net changes: the size at the mouth of the net is 3 meters (128in.), and it decreases to 64in., 32in., 16in.., 8in., etc. until it is only ½ inch by the time you are holding the codend!\nHere is a diagram to put it all together:\nIf you think about the opening of the net in terms of school buses, it will help! It turns out that the AWT’s opening height, from footrope to headrope, is 25m, which is 2 school buses high! The AWT’s opening width, is 40m across, about 3.5 school buses across! Now, you can see why positioning and maneuvering the net takes so much care– and how we can catch a lot of pollock!\nNow, when the scientists decide it is “time to go fishing” (from acoustic data, which will be the topic of the next blog) they call the officers up on the Bridge, who orient the ship into its optimal position and slow it down for the upcoming trawl. Meanwhile, the deck crew is preparing the net. The scientists then move from their lab up to the Bridge to join the officers– and they work together to monitor the location and size of the nearby pollock population and oversee the release and retrieval of the net.\nAlong the headrope, there are sensors to relay information to the Bridge, such as:\n- The depth of the net\n- The shape of the net\n- If the net is tangled or not\n- How far the net is off the bottom and\n- If fish are actually swimming into the net!\nThe fish and the net are tracked on this array of computer screens. As the officers and scientists view them, adjustments to the net and its depth can be made:\nThe start of the trawl is called “EQ” – Equilibrium and the end of the trawl is called “HB” – haul back. The net can be in the water anywhere from 5-60 minutes, depending on how many fish are in the area.\nNow, sometimes an AWT catches so many fish that there are simply too many for us to measure and process in a timely fashion, so it is deemed a “splitter”! In a splitter, there’s an extra step between hauling in the net from the ocean and emptying it to be sorted and processed. The codend of the AWT is opened over a splitting crate, and half of the pollock go into a new net (that we will keep and sort through) and the rest of the pollock are returned to the water.\nLet’s continue our tour aboard the Oscar Dyson! Follow me, back to the bridge, where the OOD (Officer on Duty) is at the helm. As you already know, the first thing you notice on the bridge is the vast collection of computer screens at their disposal, ready to track information of all kinds. You will learn more about these in an upcoming blog.\nIn addition to these high-tech instruments, I was very happy to see good old-fashioned plotting on a nautical chart. In class, students, you will have a special project where you get to track the changing position of the Oscar Dyson!\nHere is a sample of the hour-by-hour plotting, done by divider, triangle, and pencil:\nI will end here with a sea specimen VERY different from pollock, but always a fan favorite— jellyfish! Interestingly, there are a large number of jellyfish in the Bering Sea- something I never would have assumed. The one that we catch in almost every net is the Northern Sea Nettle (Chrysaora melanaster). In one net, we collected 22 individuals!\nWhen we collect non-pollock species such as these, we count, weigh, and record them in the computerized database and then release them back into the ocean. Here they are coming down the conveyor belt after the net has been emptied:\nThe so-called bell, or the medusa, can be quite large- some are the diameter of large dinner plates (45cm)! Their tentacles can extend to over 3m in length. They consume mostly zooplankton, small fish (including juvenile pollock), and other jellies. How so, exactly? Well, when the tentacles touch prey, the nematocysts (stinging cells) paralyze it. From there, the prey is moved to the mouth-arms and finally to the mouth, where it’s digested.\nThis same mechanism is used by sea nettle when it encounters danger like a large predator. It stings the predator with its nematocysts and injects its toxins into its flesh. In the case of smaller predators, this venom is strong enough to cause death. In larger animals, however, it usually produces a paralyzing effect, which gives the sea nettle enough time to escape.\nNow in the case of me handling them… and other humans…their sting is considered moderate to severe. In most cases, it produces a rash, and in some cases, an allergic reaction. However, we wear gloves on board and none of the scientists have ever had an issue holding them. In fact, they offered to put one on my head and take a picture… but I declined! If a few students email me, begging for such a picture, maybe I will oblige…', 'May 28, 2014\nTrawling dates back to the 1300s, and it became widespread in coastal areas around the world after the industrialization of commercial fishing in the late-1800s. Bottom trawling targets commercially valuable species that live near the sea floor, such as cod, rockfish, and various kinds of squid and shrimp. Gear varies depending on the fishing outfit, but nets can be nearly as large as a city block and scoop thousands of fish and other marine animals in a single drag.\nIn bottom trawling, a large net is dragged by a boat along the seafloor.\nBottom trawling has one of the highest bycatch rates of all commercial fishing practices. In the North Pacific, the practice accounts for 18 percent of annual groundfish harvests, and 82 percent of the region’s discarded by-catch. At times, bycatch accounts for upwards of 90 percent of a net’s total catch.\nIn addition to directly killing many fish and other marine species, studies have shown that bottom trawling is very destructive to the seabed. It dislodges sediment, which destroys the habitat of ground-dwelling organisms, makes the water more opaque and unsuitable for many species, and releases pollutants and carbon that had been trapped below the seafloor.\nAs populations of many fish species dwindle due to intensive commercial fishing effort, bottom trawling outfits are searching for new fishing grounds in ever-deeper regions of oceans around the world. However, this new study indicates that deeper ocean bottoms are also being affected by trawling, as the nets destroy delicate seafloor ecosystems at a level akin to desertification.\nA trawling net with its catch before it is dumped out on deck.\n“Thus, ultimately, intensive and chronic bottom trawling is deemed to transform large portions of the deep continental slop into faunal deserts and highly degraded seascapes.”\nBenthic, or ocean-bottom, ecosystems in the deep sea may need an even longer time to recover than near-shore environments, and may be impacted in ways that echo beyond the confines of their depths – and beyond the oceans, themselves.\n“Although we have investigated only one site in a certain time of the year, our results highlight the dramatic impact of trawling below 500-meter (1,600-foot) depths: we do not have information on the time of recovery in our study area because it is trawled all the year round on weekdays, two times per day since about 30 years!” Antonio Pusceddu, of Italy’s Marche Polytechnic University and lead author of the study, told mongabay.com.\n“Nevertheless, since deep-sea fauna have longer life spans than the shallower counterparts, we can reliably hypothesize that the time needed to recover after an eventual cessation of trawling activities could be sensibly longer (maybe years or decades) than the time needed for shallow benthic communities,” Pusceddu said. “So, the major difference in the time of recovery from trawling impact is clearly linked with the depth at which trawling is carried out.”\nThe researchers compared sediment samples from trawled and non-trawled areas off the coast of Spain, and found that bottom trawling severely reduced the overall amount of very small animals living in deep-sea sediments. Particularly affected were nematodes, tiny worms that make up the dominant group in these environments, and which are very important for ecosystem processes.\nNematodes are tiny worms that form a vital component of many aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Some species are parasites of other animals. Photo by William Wergin and Richard Sayre. Colorized by Stephen Ausmus.\nOverall, the researchers found that sediment from chronically trawled areas had 80 percent fewer tiny benthic organisms, called “meiofauna,” and 50 percent less biodiversity than areas that were not trawled. They also found trawling was linked to a 52 percent reduction in organic matter, and a 37 percent reduction in organic carbon consumption.\nCarbon consumption by deep-sea meiofauna is an important part of the carbon cycle, by which carbon is exchanged between the land, sea, and air. The researchers believe that the ubiquity of bottom trawling along the world’s coasts may be affecting carbon cycling in significant ways.\n“Deep-sea trawling is currently carried out along large sectors of the oceans,” write the authors, “and it appears to have severe consequences on deep-sea sediment dynamics at a global scale.”\nThese consequences may be echoed up marine food chains, as many organisms are ultimately dependent on meiofauna for energy and nutrients. In addition, some meiofauna are actually the larvae of bigger, or macrofaunal, species. Damage to deep-sea beds by trawling may mean both depletion of an important food source and destruction of nurseries for many species.\nOcean sediments are an important player in the global carbon cycle.\nTrawling not only destroys meiofauna outright, but also disrupts the layer of carbon-rich material that is their primary energy source. This material then hangs suspended in the water where it either takes a long time to re-descend, or is moved by ocean currents to even deeper parts of the ocean and away from the organisms that depend on it.\n“In our study we hypothesize that what happens at 500-meter depths probably influences the communities at 2,000-meter (6,500-foot) depth: sediments re-suspended at 500-meter depths can reach the deepest part of the canyon,” Pusceddu said.\nSeveral nations have imposed restrictions on bottom trawling. For instance, the U.S. banned bottom trawling off most of its Pacific coast in 2006, and Palau has both banned it throughout its jurisdiction as well as prohibited any Palauan citizen or corporation from participating elsewhere in the world. A few multinational fisheries commissions have also imposed regulations on bottom trawling in two of the most affected regions – the mid-Atlantic Ridge and the South Pacific. However, a bid by Palau to ban unregulated bottom trawling beyond the national level was blocked during United Nations negotiations by Iceland and other opposing countries.\n- Pusceddu, A., Bianchelli, S., Martín, J., Puig, P., Palanques, A., Masqué, P., & Danovaro, R.

31	maine lake science center research facilities resources available researchers	The Maine Lake Science Center provides housing for researchers, meeting space, storage space, lab facilities, and a sixty-seat conference room that is available to conservation organizations and civic groups.	['The mission of the Maine Lake Science Center is to foster and sustain initiatives that will assure the long-term resilience of freshwater systems and communities. The Center will use an interdisciplinary solutions-oriented science approach, known as sustainability science, to link science with decision maker and policy development needs at municipal, state, and federal scales.\nThe Maine Lake Science Center was established by the Lakes Environmental Association (LEA) in 2015 to help initiate and support a new generation of lake protection. The Center facilitates partnerships between academic researchers, lake associations, decision makers, educators, citizens and land use professionals, incorporating an interdisciplinary approach to promote policy upgrades and build communities that can effectively advance lake sustainability.\nThirty-six years ago, the Maine Legislature made a dramatic commitment to Maine’s lakes when it mandated shoreland zoning. This far-sighted act was generally well-accepted by citizens because Mainers could see their lakes were being damaged and cared enough to accept zoning.\nIt was not until 1990 that the next generation of lake protection came along. The Maine DEP developed a method to estimate the phosphorus pollution impact that a specific development would have on a lake. This was a significant breakthrough since it allowed for consideration of cumulative impact from all land uses in a lake’s watershed. LEA wrote a companion handbook for the DEP that outlined a process for producing a watershed inventory.\nMaine lakes are degrading and we have no comprehensive method of determining their rate of decline. Lake Auburn’s unexpected algae bloom is the latest example of a lake’s abrupt and unexpected decline in water quality. Judging from oxygen and nutrient levels in the 40 lakes LEA monitors, there is the potential for this pattern to be repeated throughout the state. Lakes are the backbone for the economy of hundreds of Maine towns, but monitoring standards have not kept pace with science and we have done an inadequate job of educating decision makers, interest groups and landowners. Protecting lakes means fully understanding what is going on in their watersheds and their waters in order to make the case through research and education for the public to support the types of management tools that are needed to avoid the “Lake Auburn Syndrome”. We have an opportunity to take the type of bold initiative that Maine legislators took in 1973 to protect a priceless and increasingly-endangered resource. LEA believes the science of lake protection needs to be harnessed to allow us to protect water quality for future generations and our economy. And, education and a positive experience in the natural world complement scientific knowledge in promoting the changes that will be needed.\nHow the objectives will be accomplished\nLEA has established the Maine Lake Science Center (MLSC) to attract world-class researchers and to support and empower those already doing research in Maine. We have formed a Lake Science Advisory Board with researchers from Maine to Lake Tahoe to guide the Center’s work, representing a full range of disciplines. At the Board’s first meeting in 2013, it was clear that much more could be done to network those who were working in the field. That year LEA hired its first researcher to expand traditional testing parameters and help with the networking challenge.\nLEA staff spent five years visiting lake centers around the country to learn their methods and establish relationships. This valuable experience helped us shape our vision for the Maine Lake Science Center. Each place we visited added dimension to the vision and everyone we met was excited about the project and its importance.\nOne of the basic needs for researchers is housing. Meeting space, storage space and lab facilities are other essential requirements. The Center offers all of these resources and a sixty-seat conference room available to conservation organizations and civic groups.\nLEA has a rich and long history of natural resource education, beginning 25 years ago. Education at all levels is essential for accomplishing project objectives since we ultimately seek to modify behaviors, policy and methodologies. Before any of these changes can effectively be made, there must be a clear showing of the practicality and scientific basis for the changes. We will need to rely on the same support-through-understanding and knowledge-to-action that helped the legislature pass shoreland zoning laws in the 1970’s.\nWhile research is the pinnacle of the educational process, LEA has built a complex education program that reflects our belief that each interest group and age level has a stake in water quality and should be addressed in a separate and unique way. We have two full-time educators who oversee our program, but all staff members are engaged in some form of education. Target audiences are diverse but are part of a holistic effort to gain broad-based understanding and support:\nOutdoor Learning and Recreation\nThe book Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children From Nature-Deficit Disorder was a sentinel for those involved in environmental education. LEA’s emphasis on conservation lands is based on the belief that getting kids and even adults into the natural world is the first step in instilling an appreciation for our natural resources. Most of our educational programs combine fun in the natural world and learning. The 700-acre Holt Pond Preserve epitomizes the union between recreation and education. It provides a marvelous outdoor classroom for hundreds of kids each year. The preserve also allows hunting, fishing, trapping, canoeing, and snowmobiling. Hiking and cross-country skiing are popular as well.\nThe 66-acre Pondicherry Park offers a rare opportunity to get into the woods right in downtown Bridgton. The park mirrors the Holt Pond recreation-education model and is receiving heavy use because of its convenient location. The MLSC property is adjacent to the park and effectively expands the park’s acreage by 18 acres. LEA allows the park to utilize a parking area as an entryway from Willett Road, just off Route 302. Trail extensions link the Center with Pondicherry Park. This year we will build a forest interpretive trail on Center property as the first outdoor education resource of several planned.\nEvidence of Urgency and Need\nThe urgency for the monitoring and research component of the Maine Lake Science Center project are highlighted by the experience at Lake Auburn and the vulnerability of hundreds of other Maine lakes. Prevention of water quality degradation is the goal. Remediation is enormously expensive and can never achieve a return to historic water quality. There was no focal point for lake research in Maine. Much of the research went unnoticed. It was only after we began to examine the research that we learned about the three new and vital parameters we have adopted into our testing protocol. They are directed at assessing the vulnerability of a lake to algal blooms. The Maine Lake Science Center now serves as a mechanism for collaborations and communications to help stem the tide of water quality decline.\nOutdoor and natural resource education is becoming a rare entity, especially for public school systems. LEA is welcomed in dozens of classrooms on a regular basis because field trips and hands-on experiences are in decline. We use the nation’s Next Generation Science Standards to design our curriculum. These materials are readily shared with other groups and schools throughout Maine. Our programs are free, allowing schools to use their limited funds for such necessities as program transportation. In a state as rich as Maine is in natural resources, it is ironic that so few schools have this opportunity.\nThe best outcome would be a breakthrough in our understanding of “tipping points” for lake water quality and thus the ability to predict and avert problems. While this may seem optimistic, we need to consider the impact of combining the knowledge base that currently exists but is not shared. As our advisory board has already demonstrated, sharing this knowledge and developing strategic research questions will lead to an escalation of understanding. This, in turn, will allow us to better focus the next generation of work to re-structure lake testing protocols, upgrade standards and change behaviors.']	['<urn:uuid:0639db40-7006-4d40-84a9-c6ba2d3b1f10>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	9	29	1332
32	character design technical performance evolution	Children's TV character design involves careful consideration of both creative and practical elements. For names, creators emphasize easy pronunciation and good rhythm, as seen with Teletubbies' 'Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa and Po.' Technical aspects also affect character development - as demonstrated by Mr. Snuffleupagus, whose massive costume requires two performers and special operation techniques, including a stick for eye movements, strings for eyelids, and a handle for mouth control. The puppet is so large it must be stored above the studio soundstage, and during performances, camera operators help cool the puppeteers with fans between takes.	"['Who is the most popular builder in the world? Easy. He’s eight inches tall and made out of foam and silicone. His best friend is a dipper called Scoop. And his fans have no doubt at all over whether he can repair things satisfactorily.\nCan he fix it? Yes he can!\nYet Bob the Builder – a children’s show created in Britain that went on to conquer the planet – was very nearly “Bill the Builder”. Stranger still, there was serious talk he should be “Bob the Construction Worker”.\nBob’s creator, Keith Chapman, explains: “It was a toss-up between Bill the Builder and Bob the Builder. But Bill didn’t sound quite right.”\nAnd “Bob the Construction Worker”? Well, Chapman was advised that the term “builder” isn’t often used in America, and if he was considering selling the programme overseas... “but, thankfully, in the end they let us keep the name.”\nBeing a bog-standard builder doesn’t seem to have held Bob back. He’s been translated into 45 languages and shown in almost every country on the planet. Chapman says that Bob has raked in worldwide revenues – from TV sales, merchandising and so on – of more than $5 billion. Incredibly, that’s nearly twice the amount earned by Avatar, the biggest movie of all time.\nOf course, when we remember the children’s characters that mean the most to us, we’re not interested in how much money they made. (For a start, when the likes of Muffin the Mule or Noggin the Nog were doing their stuff on screen, the merchandising industry was barely out of nappies.)\nWhether we’re from the generation that harks back to Andy Pandy, The Magic Roundabout or The Tweenies, we know the emotional power of these shows. Why? Because they were what we watched when we first started watching TV.\nHow can you not feel warm when you think of Mr Benn, Festive Road and “as if by magic, the shoekeeper appeared”?\nIs there anything more enchanting than Basil Brush’s “Boom! Boom!”, the “underground, overground” Wombles of Wimbledon or Bagpuss’s satisfied yawn?\nWhich is probably why it’s so rewarding to watch our own children watching their own programmes. Because when they’re in front of Iggle Piggle, Fireman Sam or Charlie and Lola, they’re investing in their own future nostalgia.\nBut for every show that hits the spot, there are dozens that rightly drift into obscurity. So what’s the secret of a successful children’s TV character?\nWhen RT consulted experts in the field, they all agreed on one thing: getting the name right is crucial. It has to be easy for a child to pronounce, it has to have the correct rhythm and, if you’re looking to sell lots of games and toys (and everyone is), it has to look good when printed on a box (another reason why “Bob the Builder” triumphs over “Bob the Construction Worker”).\nAnna Wood, co-creator of Teletubbies, says the name Tinky Winky “just came to me. Then we sat down and worked out the other names so it went in a nice rhythm: Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa and Po. It took about half an hour.”\nLauren Child, who came up\nwith Charlie and Lola, agrees\nthat the cadence was important:\n“I liked the sing-song sound of\nCharlie and Lola, they work well together and are easy to say.” Back in 1999 when she created the lovable brother and sister, few little girls were called Lola, “but\nI sensed that there was something in the air and that this name would become popular. This has proved to be the case – I now meet countless Lolas.” (Whether this would have been the case without Child’s own characters is difficult to say, of course.)\nTiming can be important, too. The Teletubbies – all of whom have hi-tech screens in their bellies – came at the start of the digital revolution.\nBob the Builder launched when DIY was becoming intensely fashionable (remember Changing Rooms and the 101 variations that followed?). Quite why this should affect an audience that wouldn’t be allowed to pick up a power drill, one doesn’t know. But Keith Chapman is convinced it helps explain his success: “The show hit at the right time.” Humour is the next key ingredient. On this, everyone is pretty much agreed. Physical comedy will never go out of fashion.\n“Falling over is the best joke of all time,” says Anne Wood, the woman behind Iggle Piggle and Roland Rat as well as Teletubbies. “It’s funny to a pre-school audience because you’re at the age where you fall over and you’ve just learnt how to get up again.” If you fall over more than once, it’s even funnier.\nRichard Starzak who devised Shaun the Sheep, agrees. “Slapstick is a universal language.” This can, however, pose a problem when you’re making a show aimed at very young people. “There’s a lot of comedy in other people’s pain, of course. But there are things you can’t do on children’s shows. We can’t really have characters being hit on the head.\n“I understand why. We don’t want to be responsible for kids hitting each other with frying pans. But I sometimes think children’s TV can be overly safe. I don’t think cartoon-style violence affects kids. I think it’s a bit of escapism.”\nHe recalls with fondness an edition of ITV’s Tiswas from his own childhood. “They used to lift children out of tea chests by their ears. Then, one Saturday, one of the kids cut himself on the edge of the chest, and was bleeding on live TV. Chris Tarrant lifted him out, put him to one side and said: ‘Could you pass me another one that’s not bleeding?’ And they carried on with the show. Can you imagine the front pages of the newspapers if that happened today?” (Tiswas also featured a man repeatedly hitting himself over the head with a metal tray while singing Mule Train.)\nCharlie and Lola, too, have been reined in. Lauren Child says that a proposed episode in which Lola caught head-lice was rejected by a squeamish Disney corporation, which had partially financed the show. Meanwhile, in the original books, Lola eats biscuits and crisps and sometimes stands on chairs. Not in the BBC version – where she snacks on fruit and never, ever climbs on furniture. (Though there will be plenty of parents who applaud the show’s anti-crisp stance.)\n“And we almost had a problem with Lola doing forward rolls,” adds Child. “The BBC got terribly worried she could have a dreadful accident and break her neck. It doesn’t matter that she and Charlie are fictional, and they’re made of paper. The designers had to draw a very squishy mattress for her to do her forward roll on.”\nThen there are the things that don’t matter. Look at an episode of Clangers or Trumpton and the quality of animation looks quite amateur by today’s standards – whether you compare it with the smooth stop-motion animation of Shaun the Sheep or the computer-generated Mike the Knight. Yet what difference did it make that the action was a little juddery?\nNick Park, creator of Wallace & Gromit, says his favourite show as a child was Clangers. “There was always something a little quirky about it, unpredictable.\n“I liked the crude way it was done. It made you think you could do it at home. I started animating as a 13-year-old. I was emulating Clangers.”\nHe is currently part of the team making a new Shaun the Sheep movie. A prequel to the TV series, it’s due for release early next year and will feature all the characters from the TV show and explain how they got to know each other.\nAs editor of Blue Peter from 1965 to 1988, Biddy Baxter had her finger on the pulse of children’s TV – and was another Clangers fan: “It was wonderful... the animation and the groans and the squeaks and the grunts. It was so surreal. You could use your imagination.”\nBut she doesn’t envy readers having to choose a favourite in our children’s character poll. “How awful to have to choose between Basil Brush, The Magic Roundabout and Clangers!\n“And then, of course, there was Paddington. I had a huge affection for Paddington because it was created by Michael Bond, a lovely man who was a cameraman on Blue Peter. Paddington was such a sympathetic character – and children, on the whole, are pretty keen on bears.”\nLauren Child is another Paddington advocate: “I was watching it on DVD with my four-year- old daughter yesterday, and I don’t think it’s dated: it’s got a snappy pace, it’s very funny and the jokes are very sophisticated.”\nThe point is you need to watch the programmes with the eye of a child and leave your adult preconceptions at home.\nNever was this more apparent than in 1999 when the Teletubbies found themselves at the centre of a bizarre international furore. American TV evangelist Jerry Falwell denounced the BBC show for secretly “role modelling a gay lifestyle” – which, he said, was “damaging to the moral lives of children”. His evidence? Tinky Winky – “whose voice is obviously that of a boy” – carried a handbag, and “he is purple – the gay pride colour; and his antenna is shaped like a triangle – the gay pride symbol.” Even after all these years, Anne Wood is irked. “Jerry Falwell had his own agenda and before he died he admitted to that. But his comments stopped all the sales of Teletubbies merchandise in the southern states of America because everybody thought Tinky Winky was a homosexual.\n“It was so insulting. The fact is that children’s television is about love, it’s got nothing to do with sex at all. And all children – boys and girls – love to look in your handbag. I haven’t known a child who didn’t.”\nMeanwhile, Bob the Builder seems to have been sending out strange messages, too, albeit of a different kind. For he is rather more philanthropic than your average odd-job man.\n“You’ll notice,” says Keith Chapman, “that he never seems to take money off anyone. Not even a deposit. So he’s doing all this work for nothing!”\nChoose your favourite and vote in our poll right here', '|PERFORMER||Jerry Nelson 1971-1978|\n|Michael Earl 1978-1981|\n|Martin P. Robinson 1981-present|\nAlthough his friends call him Snuffy, his full name is Aloysius Snuffleupagus. He is eternally four and a half years old, and celebrates his birthday on August 19. Snuffy\'s best friend is Big Bird, whom he affectionately calls ""Bird.""\nHis favorite foods are cabbage and spaghetti, and in the fifth season premiere, he revealed that he also drinks sassafras tea. In one episode during his debut season, it is revealed that Snuffy is afraid of fruit. He dislikes apples because he fears they might fall from the tree and hit him on the head, and he dislikes bananas out of fear that he might slip on the peels.\nSnuffy is a big fan of opera music, and at one point attended daily rehearsals at Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. He even performed a light-opera rendition of the alphabet with Judy Collins. In one episode, Snuffy tap danced with Maurice and Gregory Hines, known as the Hines Brothers (who were appearing in the Broadway musical Eubie! at the time).\nMr. Snuffleupagus first appeared on Sesame Street in Episode 0276, the third season premiere. When he first appeared, many of the adults assumed that he was Big Bird\'s imaginary friend, due to a series of coincidences and near-miss encounters that continually kept Snuffleupaguses and humans apart. Big Bird would often try to find ways for Snuffy to meet the adults, but something would always cause Snuffy to leave before the humans could see him. Sometimes, all it would take for the adults to see Mr. Snuffleupagus would be to turn their heads, yet they usually wouldn\'t do so until Snuffy had already gone.\nWhile Snuffy served as the show\'s resident incredulous figure for years, other characters had alleged imaginary friends of their own. Mr. Hooper reminisces about ""Mr. Meshuggenah"" in Episode 0513. Big Bird accuses David of manufacturing his childhood friend Bill in Episode 1940, and similarly doesn\'t believe in David\'s juggler friend Michael Davis (who also does not believe in Big Bird) in Episode 1959. Snuffy describes his friend the Wheelermonster in Episode 0806 (whom Big Bird believes to be made-up), in Episode 2014 Uncle Wally made up the very similar Mrs. Snortleoutagus, or ""Snorty"" for short, and, until she met him in Episode 1494, Mommy Snuffleupagus originally thought Big Bird to be Snuffy\'s imaginary friend. In fact, on at least two occasions (in episodes 0361 and 0731) the adults manage to — temporarily — convince Big Bird that his friend Snuffy isn\'t real.\nFrom 1971 to 1985, various kids could see Mr. Snuffleupagus, some Muppets saw him, and even a few celebrities (including Judy Collins in a fantasy sequence), but the major human characters never believed his existence until Episode 2096, the season 17 premiere. In fact, many appearances of Snuffy on the show during the fourteen years in which he was ""imaginary"" (allegedly), involved some scenario in which the adults would be very close to meeting Snuffy, but then just miss him in the last moment. This was often due to Snuffy being called by his mommy or otherwise needing to go home in the time it took Big Bird to gather his friends. Snuffy can be heard in some tracks on the 1972 album Havin\' Fun with Ernie and Bert, yet none of the other Muppets acknowledge his presence. By the seventh season, Snuffy is so used to people not seeing him that in Episode 0796 he counts everyone who doesn\'t notice him.\nOne year earlier, in Episode 1966 (the season 16 premiere), Big Bird made an impassioned plea to the adults resulting in Maria, Gordon, and Linda deciding to believe that Snuffy was real despite the lack of evidence. (Maria had periodically shown signs of believing as early as Episode 1800 when she saw Snuffy\'s giant toaster.) As far back as Episode 1028, Buffy decided to believe Snuffy was real as long as Big Bird did, while in Episode 1546, Snuffy thought Buffy was Big Bird\'s imaginary friend, the ""Buffle-Upagus"", though later decided to also believe in her without meeting. On both occasions Buffy sang different songs about believing in Mr. Snuffleupagus. In Episode 2042, while Gordon made plans to meet Snuffy, Oscar instead ended up seeing Snuffy for the first time, and later that season, Oscar let Snuffy join the Grouchketeers.\nMr. Snuffleupagus became real to the entire cast for a few reasons. One was because the writers were running out of new ways to have Snuffy just barely miss meeting them. Another factor was increased concerns that the adults\' refusal to believe Big Bird\'s claims of his friend\'s existence would discourage children from sharing important things with their parents.\nMany years later, the writers played at Snuffy\'s original imaginary role in episodes 4069 and 4070 for a plot in which Snuffy became invisible. Martin Robinson once said about Snuffy, ""He\'s not invisible, he just has bad timing!""\nMr. Snuffleupagus lives with his family in a cave located at 456 Snuffle Circle. His little sister Alice was featured as a main character for several years, and he has a Snuffleupagus friend at school named Rosalyn. Sometimes he can be seen playing with his puppet Gus or his stuffed toy Mr. Anteloper.\n- Mommy Snuffleupagus\n- Daddy Snuffle\n- Alice Snuffleupagus (younger sister)\n- Aunt Agnes Snuffleupagus\n- Granny Snuffle\n- Abigail Snuffleupagus (cousin)\n- Señor Esnofelopago (cousin)\n- Uncle Abe\nIn 1992, the producers of Sesame Street tested an episode in which Snuffy\'s parents get a divorce. After a series of arguments, Daddy Snuffle moved out of the cave, and Snuffy and Alice had to deal with the emotional fallout of a breakup. The episode didn\'t test well with children, and the producers decided to shelve it. In the context of the show, Mommy and Daddy Snuffleupagus are still married.

The script for Episode 0278 includes the internal note ""Galopogus is known as Snuffle-upagus now.""\nIt takes two people to perform Mr. Snuffleupagus. The person who performs the front also performs the voice. Jerry Nelson was the first to play the character. Most sources (including Sesame Street Unpaved and 40 Years of Life on the Street) state that back problems caused by the physical stress of the performance forced him to bow out, but in a 2009 interview, Jerry Nelson gave a different explanation for giving up the role: ""I was not loath to give that character up. But the reasons for giving it up were because at that time we were doing The Muppet Show and he was a real part of the show, and they needed his presence. So they asked if I’d mind giving it up."" Michael Earl Davis took over for three seasons from 1978 to 1981, and then Marty Robinson became the permanent voice and face of Snuffy. The back of Mr. Snuffleupagus has been performed by Richard Hunt, Brian Muehl, Frank Kane, and Peter Friedman, but since 1979, the regular back-end has been Bryant Young.\nJerry Nelson recalled in the film Muppet Guys Talking that in casting for Snuffleupagus, Jon Stone described the character as ""Eeyore-like."" Hence, Snuffy originally spoke in a low, sad-sounding tone of voice, which was gradually lightened over time, and his catchphrase was ""Ohhh, dear.""\nIn the early years of Snuffy\'s Sesame Street appearances, his entrances were scored by a low-range brass musical cue (composed by Joe Raposo) which could be heard by those who could see him (Big Bird explains to Mrs. Sharp in Episode 0965 that when Snuffy walks, he makes a musical sound). A modified version of this theme appeared on various Sesame Street albums, and was the basis for Snuffy\'s song-and-dance ""Doin\' the Snuffleupagus.""\nBecause the Snuffy costume is so enormous, the suit is stored above the studio soundstage, with a pink blanket wrapped over it, when not in use. During the filming of the Hawaii episodes, the costume was maneuvered to different locations using a helicopter.\nThe Snuffy puppet and his facial movements are operated entirely from within the puppet. There is a long stick that moves his eyes around, a long string to pull down his eyelids, and a handle to pull down the lower part of his mouth, as the size of his mouth makes it practically impossible for a puppeteer to operate it like a normal puppet. The interior was first publicly shown in the Sesame Family Robinson blog post ""HandyMan in Snuffleupagus"". In another post, Marty Robinson explained that in between takes, one of the camera operators will fan air through the mouth of the puppet to cool off the puppeteers. Robinson also explained it was a lot easier to perform the puppet when it was warm as he was less likely to pull muscles, although on some days he would sweat through three or four t-shirts.\n- Similar to how Big Bird often mispronounced Mr. Hooper\'s name as Mr. Looper, Snuffy would mispronounce Mr. Handford\'s name as Mr. Handfoot.\n- His shoe size (or at least his roller skate size) is 65 triple G, as said in Big Bird\'s Birthday or Let Me Eat Cake.\n- Snuffy gets weighed in Episode 1606 and discovers he weighs 1,000 pounds.\n- According to Snuffy\'s baby book in Episode 2267, Snuffy\'s first words were ""Ohhh, dear.""\n- Sesame Street\n- Julie on Sesame Street\n- Christmas Eve on Sesame Street\n- Don\'t Eat the Pictures\n- Follow that Bird\n- Sesame Street: 20 and Still Counting\n- Sesame Street Stays Up Late\n- Elmo Saves Christmas\n- The Rosie O\'Donnell Show (November 11, 1998)\n- Elmo\'s Christmas Countdown\n- Sesame Workshop Benefit Gala (June 2, 2010)\n- Spaghetti Space Chase\n- Late Night with Jimmy Fallon (September 25, 2013)\n- Good Morning America (September 12, 2014)\n- Saturday Night Live (April 11, 2015)\n- The Rachael Ray Show (October 30, 2015)\n- Sesame Street\'s 50th Anniversary Celebration\n- Macy\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade (2019)\n- Havin\' Fun with Ernie & Bert\n- Sesame Street LIVE!\n- Big Bird Sings!\n- Merry Christmas from Sesame Street\n- Sleepytime Bird\n- Sing: Songs of Joe Raposo\n- Kids\' Favorite Songs\n- Elmo Saves Christmas: Holiday Favorites\n- Kids\' Favorite Songs 2\nBooks that focus on Snuffy include:\n- Don\'t Be Shy (1987)\n- Meet Mr. Snuffle-upagus (1988)\n- The Day Snuffy Had the Sniffles (1988)\n- Bert and the Magic Lamp (1989): ""Life-Styles of the Large and Furry""\n- See You Later, Mashed Potater!

It is also known as whooping cough. It is caused by bacteria in the mouth, nose and throat of an infected person.\nWhat are the symptoms of pertussis?\nSymptoms usually appear 7 to 10 days after infection, but may also appear up to 21 days later:\n- Initially, symptoms resemble those of a common cold (sneezing, runny nose, low-grade fever and a mild cough).\n- Within two weeks, the cough becomes more severe and is characterized by episodes of numerous rapid coughs, followed by a crowing or high-pitched ‘whoop’. These episodes frequently end with the expulsion of a thick, clear mucous, often followed by vomiting. They initially occur at night and then become more frequent during the day and may recur for one to two months.\n- In young infants the typical 'whoop' may never develop, and the coughing fits may be followed by brief periods when breathing stops. After this phase, the coughing fits become less frequent and less severe, and the infant gradually gets better (this can take up to three months).\nAdolescents, adults, or children partially immunised generally have milder or somewhat different symptoms. In these groups, and in very young infants, pertussis is harder to diagnose.\nWhat are the complications of pertussis?\nThe most severe forms of pertussis are in infants. Pertussis in unvaccinated infants or infants whose mother was unvaccinated can be particularly severe. Complications include pneumonia, encephalopathy (a disease of the brain), seizures and even death.\nIn adults and older children, complications include inability to breathe for short periods, broken ribs, rectal prolapse and hernias.\nHow is pertussis spread?\nPertussis is spread via airborne droplets produced when the infected person coughs. Pertussis can also be spread by an individual who has only a mild form of the disease, or by an infected individual who has no symptoms at all. Frequently, older siblings and parents who may be carrying the bacteria bring the disease home and infect an infant in the household.\nWho is at risk of pertussis?\nAnyone who is not vaccinated with the pertussis vaccine, or whose vaccination status is not up-to-date, is at risk of contracting the disease.\nHow can pertussis be prevented?\nThe most important way to prevent pertussis is through complete immunisation. The vaccine for pertussis is usually given in combination with diphtheria and tetanus vaccination (often in combination also with poliomyelitis, Haemophilus influenzae and hepatitis B vaccination). A primary course of 2-3 doses is usually given between two and twelve months of age, in accordance with the national vaccination schedule. A third or fourth dose is recommended at 11-24 months of age, and another dose between three and seven years of age.\nSome EU/EEA countries recommend boosters for adolescents, adults, and/or women during pregnancy, which also temporarily protects the baby once it is born. Some countries also recommend a booster to unprotected women soon after they have delivered, to reduce the risk of transmission of the disease to the baby.\nHow is pertussis treated?\nAntibiotics can be used to treat pertussis and prevent further spread of the disease. However, in order to be most effective, treatment must begin early in the course of disease, during the first one to two weeks before the episodes of numerous rapid coughs occur.\nFor more information check the ECDC website: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/pertussis/facts\nNote: The information contained in this factsheet is intended for the purpose of general information and should not be used as a substitute for the individual expertise and judgement of a healthcare professional.""]"	['<urn:uuid:042c3d49-7175-44b2-8a77-3b4cb6b5ef98>', '<urn:uuid:00a3e673-fe4e-41b8-a3ef-617ef6f34924>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	9	46	1489

Sports psychology focuses on helping athletes improve performance and motivation in sports contexts, while psychotherapy is broader, treating various mental disorders and helping people cope with life crises. Sports psychologists work specifically with athletes and coaches, while psychotherapists work with anyone experiencing psychological difficulties.	['It seems that every time a person flips through the television channels they are likely to see a psychologist talking about something or other. Sport psychology is the scientific study of people and their behaviors in sport contexts and the practical application of that knowledge.\nSport psychologists teach cognitive and behavioral strategies to athletes in.\nSports psychology definition short. The study of how psychology influences sport and exercise: The study of how psychology…. Some sports psychologists work with professional athletes and coaches to improve performance and increase motivation.\nThis specialty incorporates the science of physiology, kinesiology, and biomechanics to assist sports psychologists in treating a range of mental health. Sport psychology is commonly referred to as sport and exercise psychology, as it is used for team sports as well as individual fitness endeavors 1. Introduction this sports psychology short course will include reflective and practical activities.\nSport psychology has a relatively short past, and in recent years is it becoming far more accepted and utilized as a valuable competitive edge among athletes and coaches. Based on this definition, sports psychologists can participate in various activities, mostly focused on working to understand what motivates athletes and how athletes can improve their performance. In june of 2010, the los angeles lakers beat the boston celtics in the nba finals.\nStrictly speaking, sports psychology and exercise psychology are two separate areas but they are often referred to jointly. Their work is centred on how psychology influences sport and how it can improve performance.

This paper is intended to be a starting point for further developments regarding the training and certification of future practitioners. Sports psychology is essentially the study of how the mind affects physical activity and athletic performance.\nSetting goals is an important starting point. For each individual, there are core personality components that are quite stable and unchanging. Sport psychology is an interdisciplinary science that draws on knowledge from many related fields including biomechanics, physiology, kinesiology and psychology.it involves the study of how psychological factors affect performance and how participation in sport and exercise affect psychological and physical factors.\nTop sports psychology resources to improve performance! Sports psychology is the study of how psychology influences sports, athletic performance, exercise, and physical activity. All good athletes set goals and develop targets and plans to achieve their goals.\nPersonality has been defined as the relatively stable organization of an individual’s character, temperament, intellect, and physique, which shapes the individual’s behavior and his or her actions in a given situation. 47 recently completed a paper (pdf, 86kb) that more thoroughly defines the practice of sport psychology. The practice committee of div.\nThe term “psychology” can be an asset in the application of psychological principles to sport because psychology as a field has become much more acceptable to the public. A goal is simply something you are trying to accomplish; Sport psychology interventions are designed to assist athletes and other sports participants (e.g., coaches, administrators, parents) from a wide array of settings, levels of competition and ages, ranging from recreational youth participants to professional and olympic athletes to master’s level performers.\nHowever, when one observes patterns of behavior in an individual …', 'Psychotherapy is a method of treatment in which various psychotherapeutic techniques are used, namely, behavioral, cognitive, etc. The psychotherapist works on painful manifestations (neurotic and other disorders), as well as negative experiences that are caused by difficult life situations.\nToday psychotherapy is gaining immense popularity and is in great demand. It is necessary not only for people with mental illness, but also useful for those who are faced with life crises. Modern tempo , workload, personal and social problems often lead a person to the need to receive psychotherapeutic help.\nThere is a misconception that psychotherapy is used exclusively by those who have serious mental disorders, but this is far from the case. Even the strongest, most successful, healthy people are not immune to stressful situations. Many have difficult periods when the help of a psychologist or psychotherapist may be needed.\nMany people hesitate to seek help from specialists, try to overcome difficulties on their own, but in the case of neurotic disorders, this is lost time, and under the pressure of life circumstances, this may not be enough internal resources.\nPeople with mental illnesses (schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, etc.), patients of psychiatrists who have undergone treatment and entered a state of stable remission, often need psychotherapy to understand and accept the disease and their experience of being in it. They need support in getting rid of difficult experiences and in gaining new, useful communication skills. Psychotherapy helps during the rehabilitation period of such patients and is aimed at adaptation and adaptation to a new life situation, that is, their resocialization. Naturally, in these cases, a prerequisite is interaction, cooperation of a psychotherapist and psychologist with a psychiatrist, since psychotherapy can only complement drug treatment, but cannot replace it.\nPsychotherapy is a joint work of a psychotherapist with a patient, aimed at identifying conscious and unconscious painful experiences in order to eliminate them. Translated from Greek, psychotherapy means healing the soul.\nThe treatment process is based on psychotherapeutic techniques; it necessarily has its own rules and characteristics of the conduct.\nIs engaged in psychotherapeutic help, using various psychotherapeutic techniques, a psychotherapist or psychologist trained in psychotherapeutic work. The psychotherapist can also prescribe medications, since he is a doctor.\nThe main directions of psychotherapy\nThe main directions of psychotherapy, which we will consider in this article:\n- Behavioral (or behavioral )\nFundamental in behavioral psychotherapy is the idea that it is the wrong, incorrectly formed patterns of behavior, skills that are the cause of some mental disorders. That is why the main goal of behavioral psychotherapy is considered to change ingrained and undesirable forms of behavior in order to create the necessary, useful ones for the client. This direction of psychotherapy is especially successfully used in the treatment of phobias, behavioral disorders, addictions. In such a situation, the symptom can be considered a kind of “target” for therapy.\nExistential-humanistic psychotherapy sets itself the task of leading the patient to a conscious rethinking of his own life, understanding the fundamental life values, priorities and changing the life scenario based on these values, with the obligatory acceptance of responsibility for his life, decisions, choices.\nFor dynamic psychotherapy, the basic concept is the understanding of the dynamics of the patient’s mental life, which is based on the concept of the unconscious . Attention is focused precisely on the fact that the impact of experience from a stranger affects the formation of a style of behavior through cognitive methods, interpersonal interactions and the perception of communication partners that a person follows in life.\nEach of the listed areas of psychotherapy has completely different mechanisms of influence on the patient, but they are united by one essential quality – an orientation not towards symptoms, but towards the personality of a person who needs help.\nPsychotherapy can have different goals, and, accordingly, is as follows:\n- Retraining. Conducts the reconstruction of destructive skills that negatively affect the life and adaptation of a person in society. During a psychotherapy session, results are achieved by supporting and encouraging positive behaviors in the patient.\n- Supportive. The idea is to strengthen the defense mechanisms available in patients, as well as the development of new patterns of behavior that will help restore and stabilize the emotional state.\nThe main types of psychotherapy\nThe main types of psychotherapy are:\nThe basis of this type of psychotherapy is the idea that mental disorders arise from the patient’s illogical beliefs, his dysfunctional thinking stereotypes.\nFounder – Aaron Beck – American psychotherapist, professor of psychiatry.\nThis type of psychotherapy is effective in treating neurotic disorders and gradually changes patterns of thinking, habitual stereotypes of perception, and behavior. The patient gradually learns to find ways out of various situations that seemed too difficult to him, he rethinks what is happening in his life and deliberately corrects it. The therapist helps you think and act more adaptively .\nPsychoanalysis is a theory created by the Austrian psychoanalyst and psychiatrist Sigmund Freud, as well as a system of the same name for the treatment of mental – neurotic disorders. With the help of psychoanalysis, you can study the unconscious. This enables the patient to understand the causes and manifestations of internal conflicts and thus get rid of some mental disorders, since, according to the supporters of the psychoanalytic approach, it is the conflicts of the conscious and unconscious that are expressed in anxiety, depression, fears and other mental disorders.\nDuring the psychotherapeutic process, they use the method of free associations, analysis of actions, interpretation of dreams, etc. The analyst listens to everything the patient shares, asks questions and, understanding the flow of free associations, comes to the definition and solution of the patient’s problem.\nThe founder – Carl Gustav Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist and educator, believed that the main task was to interpret the archetypal images that arise in patients. Therefore, the goal of the psychoanalyst is to discuss with the patient his experiences using symbols, metaphors, images. Thanks to the analysis, complexes are eliminated and the vital energy of a person is released, which can be directed to the elimination of psychological problems and development.\nThe founder of psychodrama is the Romanian psychiatrist, Jacob Moreno. Thanks to playing, like acting, various life situations in a psychotherapeutic group, emotions are lived and actions are performed that are not always possible to manifest in real life. Thus, the skills of solving personal problems with the reproduction of fears, fantasies and conflict situations are acquired. Psychodrama is the first emerging form of psychotherapy for group sessions.\n- Gestalt therapy\nThe basic ideas were developed by the German psychiatrist Fritz Perls . If we compare this method with psychoanalysis, in gestalt therapy, the psychotherapist does not interpret the patient’s unconscious, but helps him in the development of self-awareness. The doctor is not a passive observer, but participates in the process, interacting with the patient in a dialogue. With the help of gestalt therapy, a holistic perception of oneself appears, a person begins to live not in the world of the past and fantasies, but “here and now.”\nIn addition to the above types of psychotherapy, there are also many others: symbol drama , family, client-centered therapy, etc. You can try to work with your inner world using various psychotherapeutic techniques and choose the one that suits you.\nPsychotherapist and patient. Relations\nThe psychotherapist and the patient should be in a trusting relationship, that is, their interaction should be based on mutual trust.\nThere are times when, when seeking help from a psychotherapist, a patient expects that his painful manifestations will resolve very quickly, and all that is necessary is not to miss psychotherapy sessions, but this is completely wrong. Indeed, a doctor can prescribe medication, but in addition to taking medications, you will have to work hard. If the patient comes with the thought that everything will be done for him, there is no need to expect positive dynamics. Here it is necessary to cooperate with the highest possible level of readiness on the part of the person who applied for psychotherapeutic help to work with their internal and external problems. This is the only way to achieve sustainable results in overcoming neurotic symptoms and improvements in life spheres. The short-term nature of this type of work is a rare occurrence, since the problems and defense mechanisms that have to be corrected have most often accumulated over the years. Naturally, simply “throwing” them out of life will not work. Lasting change means serious and long-term work.\nThe result of psychotherapy\nThe positive results of psychotherapy are undeniable, since during treatment and rehabilitation a stable effect is achieved, not only with the possibility of acquiring new behaviors, skills, support for the patient, but also in the case of working in a group – improving communication in society, since the group is its small section … With the help of psychotherapy, you can cope with crises, mental disorders of the neurotic spectrum. In many cases, it is possible to further overcome neurotic symptoms without taking medications using psychotherapeutic techniques and techniques that have been developed during psychotherapy sessions.']	['<urn:uuid:182cb2e9-e79b-4399-a246-feaa0fc50108>', '<urn:uuid:da66c7e4-f871-4901-ba00-e0e76a2daa52>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	7	57	2224
35	What is the main advantage of having longer 60-nucleotide probes in the Agilent microarray platform compared to other systems?	The Agilent system with 60 nt-long probes tends to be more specific compared to the Affymetrix microarrays, which is an advantage of their design.	['Oligonucleotide microarrays participate in the basic equipment of molecular biology and invite for simultaneous evaluation from the expression degree of a large number of genes. Hanin, and Dr. I Ruler Jordan. transcription), we.e. HG-U133_Plus_2 or HG-U133A, which is constructed as 11 pieces of ideal match (PM) probes comprising 25?nt sequences, which generally were chosen away of 600?nt series fragments located close to the 3 end of a particular transcript. For each PM probe over the microarray, a MM (mismatch) probe is available where all nucleotides but one are similar to those over the corresponding PM probe however the primary 13th nucleotide is certainly replaced with a noncomplementary one. The explanation behind the MM probes would be to measure the known degree of nonspecific hybridization , however the usefulness of the concept continues to be doubted (find further on). The newest era of Affymetrix microarrays, like the HuGene 1.0ST, is constructed using probes like the regular DNQX IC50 PM probes but with affinity never to the noncoding area of the 3 end but instead to the average person exons in confirmed transcript. Within this style the MM probes are changed by the backdrop Strength Probes (BGP), which are made to evaluate background strength amounts for probes of different series characteristics. BGP certainly are a group of about 1000 probes, noncomplementary to any individual gene series, with a adjustable proportion of GC nucleotides within the series. This approach allows an improved evaluation of nonspecific hybridization over the microarray weighed against MM probes, that the transmission exceeds the PM transmission because of probe-specific results  often. Additionally, lowering the amount of probes which assess nonspecific hybridization enables inserting of the much higher variety of PM probes. The probe occur the new era of entire transcript microarrays is certainly designed with two amounts, gene and exon level. The exon probe established contains 4 probes typically, which are customized for person exons, and they are clustered after that, in sets of around 25 generally, creating pieces for person genes. Using this process you’ll be able to determine degrees of person differently-spliced transcripts. Another well-known system may be the Agilent microarray system that was built utilizing the SurePrint technology which allows using a lot longer, 60?nt-long probes. While probes are than in the Affymetrix program longer, the amount of probes per gene is leaner significantly, 8 typically within the most expensive group of exon microarrays (2??400?k) or 2 whatsoever expensive system (8??60?k). As the Agilent probes are than those within the Affymetrix microarrays longer, the functional program DNQX IC50 is commonly more particular which can be an apparent benefit, but alternatively the lower variety of probes per gene makes Agilent microarrays more delicate to one nucleotide variations. These last mentioned ought never to have an effect on the transmission if indeed they derive from amplification mistakes , however they might influence the expression quotes caused by feature top features of the test analyzed. Regarding DNQX IC50 the Affymetrix microarray program these resources of mistake DNQX IC50 shall just have a influence, as they impact transmission only within an person probe for the transcript or even a transcript-specific probe-set. One nucleotide polymorphisms usually do not obstruct the hybridization but lower its performance, which may be interpreted as a substantial loss of gene appearance, an attribute which S1PR2 can be used to calculate the amount of non-specific hybridization using mismatch probes [54, 55] or even to assess allelic frequencies using SNP microarrays . Within the Affymetrix systems the transmission in one designed probe terribly, which might be predicated on inaccurate data from a series database, could be quickly eliminated from additional evaluation  without significant reduction in the accuracy of gene appearance estimate, while in the Agilent systems the same design glitch might cause.']	['<urn:uuid:28f3482f-6a5c-4508-bbfb-b219e40e499f>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	19	24	624
36	As an astrophysicist focused on galaxy evolution, I'm curious how scientists plan to track the development of magnetic fields in faraway galaxies since their direct observation is quite challenging?	While polarized emission from intermediate-redshift galaxies is often too faint for direct detection, their magnetic fields can be studied through rotation measures (RMs) they produce in the polarized background grid. This enables detailed studies of magnetic field configurations in earlier epochs, which can be compared with local galaxies to understand how magnetized structures evolve as galaxies mature.	['Understanding Cosmic Magnetism\nUnderstanding the Universe is impossible without understanding magnetic fields. They fill interstellar space, affect the evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters, contribute significantly to the total pressure of interstellar gas, are essential for the onset of star formation, and control the density and distribution of cosmic rays in the interstellar medium (ISM).\nIn spite of their importance, the origin of magnetic fields is still an open problem in fundamental physics and astrophysics. Did significant primordial fields exist before the first stars and galaxies? If not, when and how were magnetic fields subsequently generated? What maintains the present-day magnetic fields of galaxies, stars and planets?\nThe Faraday rotation in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) has a negative sign on the northeastern side (on the left in the image) but is positive on the opposite side. This proves that the magnetic field in M31 is highly ordered and forms a ring, pointing away from us in the northeast and towards us on the southwest side. This demonstrates the capacity of Faraday rotation to detect fields and determine their strength and direction. The SKA will be able to apply this technique out to high redshifts, encompassing millions of galaxies and even the intergalactic medium.\nThe most powerful probes of astrophysical magnetic fields are radio waves.\nSynchrotron emission measures the field strength, while its polarisation yields the field’s orientation in the sky plane and also gives the field’s degree of ordering. Faraday rotation yields a full three-dimensional view by providing information on the field component along the line of sight, while the Zeeman effect provides an independent measure of field strength in cold gas clouds.\nHowever, measuring cosmic magnetic fields is a difficult topic still in its infancy, restricted to nearby or bright objects.\nThrough the unique sensitivity and resolution of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), the window to The Magnetic Universe can finally be fully opened. Apart from the questions we can pose today, it is important to bear in mind that the SKA will certainly discover new magnetic phenomena beyond what we can currently predict or even imagine.\nFor the Milky Way and for nearby galaxies and clusters, high-sensitivity mapping with the SKA of polarized synchrotron emission, combined with determinations of rotation measures (RM) for extended emission, for pulsars and for the background RM grid mentioned above will allow us to derive detailed three-dimensional maps of the strength, structure and turbulent properties of the magnetic field in these sources, which can be compared carefully with the predictions of various models for magnetic field generation.\nAt intermediate redshifts , polarised emission from galaxies will often be too faint to detect directly, but the magnetic fields of these sources can be traced by the RMs they produce in the polarised background grid.\nThis will allow detailed studies of the magnetic field configuration of individual objects at earlier epochs; comparison with studies of local galaxies will allow us to understand how magnetized structures evolve and amplify as galaxies mature.\nFurthermore, from a statistical standpoint, the large number of RMs obtained from intervening galaxies and Ly-alpha absorbers will allow us to distinguish between competing models for galaxy and magnetic field evolution as a function of redshift.\nAt yet higher redshifts, we will take advantage of the sensitivity of the deepest SKA fields, in which we expect to detect the synchrotron emission from the youngest galaxies and proto-galaxies. RMs of the most distant polarised objects (e.g., gamma-ray bursts and quasars beyond the epoch of re-ionisation) can constrain magnetic field strengths at the earliest epoch of galaxy formation, and help distinguish between primordial and seed origins for present-day magnetic fields. Using the unique sensitivity of the SKA, it may even be feasible to measure Faraday rotation against the Cosmic Microwave Background produced by primordial magnetic fields.\nThe main platform on which the SKA’s studies of cosmic magnetism will be based will be an All-Sky SKA Rotation Measure Survey, in which a year of observing time will yield Faraday rotation measures (RMs) for compact polarized extragalactic sources, an increase by five orders of magnitude over current data sets, and by three orders of magnitude over what could be accomplished with the Extended Very Large Array (EVLA).\nThis data-set will provide an all-sky grid of RMs at a spacing of just 20–30 arcsec between sources; many these sources will have redshifts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and its successors.\nThis RM grid will be a powerful probe for studying foreground magnetic fields at all redshifts.\nFundamental to all these issues is the search for magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium (IGM). All of empty space may be magnetised, either by outflows from galaxies, by relic lobes of radio galaxies,\nor as part of the cosmic web structure. Such a field has not yet been detected, but its role as the likely seed field for galaxies and clusters, plus the prospect that the IGM field might trace and regulate structure formation in the early Universe, places considerable importance on its discovery.\nThis all-pervading cosmic magnetic field can finally be identified through the all-sky RM survey proposed above. Just as the correlation function of galaxies yields the power spectrum of matter, the analogous correlation function of this RM distribution can then provide the magnetic power spectrum of the IGM as a function of cosmic epoch and over a wide range of spatial scales. Such measurements will allow us to develop a detailed model of the magnetic field geometry of the IGM and of the overall Universe.\nIn summary, the sheer weight of RM statistics from the SKA, combined with deep polarimetric observations of individual sources, will allow us to characterize the geometry and evolution of magnetic fields in galaxies, clusters and the IGM from high redshifts through to the present, to determine whether there is a connection between the formation of magnetic fields and the formation of structure in the early Universe, and to provide solid constraints on when and how the first magnetic fields in the Universe were generated.\nFind out more: The origin and evolution of cosmic magnetism B.

37	what happens crayfish drug repeated exposure	When crayfish received repeated drug injections, they showed psychostimulation (increased activity) that lasted for longer durations compared to initial exposure, where increased locomotion was only seen for a brief period during the infusion itself.	['Behavioral characterization of substituted amphetamines and their synthetic cathinone analogues in the rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus)\nThe functional and evolutionary conservation of neural circuits of reward is an essential component of survival. Drugs of abuse are known to “hijack” natural reward systems to produce their euphoric and reinforcing effects. Recently, synthetic cathinones have gained popularity among the drug users due to low cost, potency and widespread availability resulting from unclear legal regulatory status. Sharing a chemical structure with amphetamines, synthetic cathinones are likely to pose a significant public health threat. Even though synthetic cathinones have been in use for over a decade, the neuropharmacology, behavioral and physiological effects still remain obscure. This gap in knowledge needs to be urgently addressed in order to understand the basic pharmacological effects, development of treatment/therapy against synthetic cathinone addiction and to define a consistent legal framework to assure regulatory control. Due to the ease of experimental manipulations, modularly organized nervous system, absence of blood-brain barrier and well-characterized behavioral paradigms for drug addiction-like behaviors, crayfish continues to be an ideal model to study the addictive potential of any drug. With highly stereotyped behaviors, and a modularly organized nervous system, crustaceans offer productive research models to study proximate mechanisms of a wide range of behavioral phenomena. The current project has harnessed the advantages of this model system to investigate the behavioral effects of synthetic cathinone in comparison to known stimulants: 4-methylmethamphetamine (4-MMA) vs. mephedrone and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) vs. methylone. We explored the unconditioned behavioral effects, locomotor activity, sensitization of locomotor response, reward potential and termination effects of the above mentioned drugs at doses of 1, 3, and 10 µg/g. Our results show that all the drugs generate significant locomotor effects in crayfish. When crayfish were exposed to these drugs for the first time, increase in locomotion was seen over a brief period of time which faded eventually over the course of trial. Our study indicates that apart from already known exploratory behaviors, unique unconditioned behaviors such as claw waving and circling are observed following drug injections. Typically, these drugs were able to produce psychostimulation at lower doses (1 µg/g) where as depression of locomotion was seen at higher doses (10 µg/g). Initial exposure of these drugs increased locomotion during the infusion itself while repeated drug injections produced psychostimulation that lasted for longer durations. Using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm, we demonstrated that crayfish seek out a particular tactile environment that had previously been paired with the drug. All the drugs at 10 µg/g show preference for the substrate which was paired with the drug. Furthermore, the preference for drug-paired environment persists even after the extinction pairing sessions (when the initially drug-paired compartment was paired with saline). We also investigated the termination effects of the drug to pinpoint withdrawal like behaviors. Termination of drug resulted in production of withdrawal-like behaviors and significant differences in locomotion. This study demonstrates that crayfish offer a comparative and complementary approach in addiction research. The current study contributes an evolutionary context to our understanding of a key component in learning and of natural reward as an important life-sustaining process.']	['<urn:uuid:bdf562f7-6ef2-4e0c-a6cb-6872047f73a1>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	6	34	518
38	religious cultural impacts end of life care	Religious and cultural beliefs significantly influence end-of-life care decisions and practices. While death is universal, every culture shares a hesitancy to discuss end-of-life matters. Beliefs about end-of-life issues are deeply rooted in religious and cultural backgrounds and vary widely within socio-cultural contexts and generations. For instance, some religious communities may have specific requirements for burial timing, as seen in Islamic customs requiring burial within a day of death. Healthcare services vary in their ability to accommodate these needs - while some hospitals train staff on religious requirements for death paperwork completion, others lack facilities for large family gatherings that are common in certain cultures. This intersection of medical ethics, religious beliefs, and healthcare regulations affects treatment choices and end-of-life planning.	['Although end-of-life planning is often associated with older adults, the information applies to all individuals over 18 years of age. In many cases, especially with young adults, patients are not aware of the function or importance of advanced directives and have not given any thought to the concept.\nAn advance directive is an affirmation made by a person, who is competent to make their own decisions, describing how they wish to be medically treated or not treated in the event they lose the capacity to communicate those wishes. This can include withholding or withdrawing life sustaining treatment, decisions regarding resuscitation, and can give authority to others to make these decisions on a patient’s behalf when they are not able. (Salins, N., Gursahani, R., Mathur, R., Iyer, S., Macaden, S., Simha, N., Mani, R.K., & Rajagopal, M.R., 2018)\nThe Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA) is a federal law that obligates nearly all health care facilities to furnish patients with a written statement of their rights and to document the advance directives of patients when provided. The PSDA also mandates these health care facilities to educate their employees regarding advance directives. Under the PSDA it is unlawful to necessitate advance directives or deny patients who have them. (Campbell, J., 2020)\nThe PSDA has had a substantial impact of the end-of-life decision making process. Because of the presumption that extending life, with rare exception, is in a person’s best interest, the law is built with this as a default. When a person has an advanced directive in place that refuses treatment that may ultimately shorten their lives, health care providers now have an understanding of the treatment that may or may not be provided, instead of starting with the assumption of extending life. These decisions do not have to be defended or explained. (Shepherd, L., 2014)\nState laws also impacts advance directives and end-of-life decisions. The law varies state by state. Some states may legally remove a patient from life support in the event it is decided to benefit the patient, but that discretion is limited. The general rule is that a person should be terminally ill or in an unconscious state that is believed to be permanent. However, some states allow the withdrawal of life support in patient’s with end-stage diseases or conditions and advanced dementia, and a few states do not restrict the jurisdiction to withdraw life-support to any specific medical condition. (Shepherd, L., 2014)\nState laws differ significantly on an individual’s right to die and pain management, as well. When we talk about a person’s right to die, it is referring to a person’s right to end their life when and in a way they see fit. There are several methods and terms that are used when discussing this, including ‘aid in dying’, ‘physician-assisted suicide’, and ‘VSED’ (voluntarily stopping eating and drinking).\nPain management, in the setting of end-of-life decisions, include high-dose medications, medical marijuana, and palliative/total sedation. Palliative/total sedation, also known as terminal sedation, is used to alleviate extreme pain that is not helped by other medications, by keeping a dying person in a sedated state until death. (Glossary of terms, 2019) And, I’m sure we have all heard about the most recent debate regarding medical marijuana. While medical marijuana is now legal in almost three-quarters of the country, not all medical facilities will prescribe or even recommend this as a pain management option. (Hanson, K., nd) So, while the state laws regarding these issues can impact your end-of-life decisions, it is important to research your own state laws.\nEnd of life decisions are part of advanced care planning. Advanced care planning and advanced directives are related, but not the same thing. Advanced directives are legal documents expressing your wishes regarding medical treatment, but advanced care planning is more than this. A significant step in advanced care planning is discussions with family members and any other person who would be involved in decisions regarding your health in the case of a critical illness or injury. The person(s) that you choose as your ‘Durable’ Power of Attorney (POA), will need to understand your wishes and be willing to take responsibility to ensure proper action is taken. (Advance Care Planning, 2018). The Power of Attorney is one of the documents considered to be an advanced directive, this gives legal authority to a person(s) to make decisions on your behalf when you are no longer able to do so. Another part of an advanced directive is a living will, which expresses specifically which medical treatment you want or do not want in the event of critical illness or injury.\nEven though the PSDA makes it unlawful for healthcare facilities to require advance directives or deny patients who have them, there are implications of missing directives for dying patients. It can cause misunderstanding and conflict between family members who are attempting to determine what the patient would want. (Advance Care Planning, 2018) There is also research that shows a substantial difference in the medical care that is given to, or not given to patients with advanced directives versus patients without advanced directives. In patients without advanced directives, skilled nursing facilities see an increase of feeding tube placements and more difficult transfers to hospitals in patients with dementia. In the Veterans Affairs (VA) system, senior adults who have an advanced directive are less likely to die in a hospital setting versus community living centers. (Kossman, D. A., 2014)\nCertain treatments and courses of action are impacted by a person’s religious and cultural beliefs. This is where medical ethics, religion/cultural beliefs, and regulations in healthcare intersect. Although death is an event that happens to everyone, regardless of background, one thing that every culture has in common is the hesitancy to discuss the end of one’s life. (Moss, K. O., Deutsch, N. L., Hollen, P. J., Rovnyak, V. G., Williams, I. C., & Rose, K. M., 2018) This is why it is so important to consider advanced planning early. One might ask if it is ethically responsible to remove a person from life support or assist them in dying. But beliefs in end-of-life issues are profoundly rooted in religion and cultural background and vary widely within socio-cultural contexts, and even generations. (Schweda, M., Schicktanz, S., Raz, A., & Silvers, A., 2017) This is why the laws vary from state-to-state, and are changing constantly. There are no right answers to these complex questions regarding end-of-life decisions. We can only do what is right for ourselves and our families.', 'Mashal Iftikhar argues that we need culturally sensitive services that do not fall into the trap of making assumptions based on the religious or cultural background of patients\n“You’re Muslim right?” The Consultant turned to me “Perhaps you can explain to the rest of us how dying in Islam works?”\nIt was an incredibly hot summer afternoon, it was the middle of Ramadan and there were still too many hours to go until the day’s fast broke. I was tired, dehydrated and had been hoping (naively) to be undisturbed during my lunch break so I could sit quietly in the corner of the office with my head down. I considered making a joke about how dying in Islam is pretty much the same as it is outside of Islam – your heart stops, you stop breathing, you keel over and your body stiffens. Not having eaten since before sunrise however had knocked my sarcasm for six.\n“What would you like to know?” I responded. Every staff member at the hospice apart from myself and one other doctor was white, an extremely unusual situation in the NHS, which is why I wasn’t surprised that I was being asked this question. In the previous hospitals where I had worked, the ubiquity of minority NHS staff meant dying Muslims and their funerary practices were hardly a mystery.\nThe Consultant explained difficulties with engaging Muslim families to use regional palliative services and applying to use the hospice as a preferred place of dying, and how this reflected the dearth of palliative referrals from minority groups in general across the country. Everyone in the office looked expectantly at me as though I, the Oracle of all practices Islamic, would be able to give The Answer to why this was the case. I was glad they were curious and cared about accommodating patients of all backgrounds, but my concern was that they would consider any answer given by myself to be sufficient and representative of all knowledge regarding the beliefs and practices of Muslim death rites.\nThe truth was that I had only attended one funeral in my entire life, in Pakistan, when I was six years old; and my comprehension of what had occurred was limited. All I understood was that my Aunt, only 26 years old (an age that seemed beyond the reach of my imagination at the time) had been suddenly snatched from the midst of our family, like a fierce wind knocks the breath out of your lungs, leaving us gasping and barely able to stand.\nWithin hours of her death being announced, she was brought home, bathed, wrapped in five plain white, unstitched sheets and a garland of roses placed around her neck, She was placed on a charpoi for everyone to pay their last respects. Family and friends urgently left their workplaces, their homes, whatever prior commitments they were engaged in to hurriedly gather from all over the globe for the burial, which would happen within the day of death – in keeping with Islamic custom. There were no speeches, no refreshments, no playing of favourite songs, no black dress code or anything that would remotely constitute a memorial service that is familiar to English funerals. We continued to wear what we were wearing when we first heard of the road traffic collision, as the crowd of family grew and spread across the house. Amongst the women where I sat, listening to their staccato sighs and muted wailing, I wondered why everyone was so upset if, as I had been told, my Aunt had indeed “gone to a better place”. Before any significant time had elapsed, the charpoi on which my Aunt lay was lifted by the men of the household and carried away to the graveyard where the women would not follow. I still did not understand that I would not see her again.\nIn the coming weeks and months I have vague recollections of the shifting countenance of grief in my family. My father, who has always been incredibly stoic and steadfast in difficult times, threw himself into his work. My mother arranged a khatm-e-Quran– where Muslims gather to complete a reading of the Quran in one sitting, in the hope that the blessings of such an act of worship will be attributed to the departed in the afterlife and increase their likelihood of attaining a station in heaven. I now know that various individuals had informed us such an expression of faith was a damned innovation. Others informed us that to grieve beyond a few days was an indication of disbelief given my Aunt’s union with God. There was no unanimous consensus on what was the most dignified and appropriate way to grieve, even among our circle of family and friends. In the bereavements that have followed since then, there still isn’t.\n“Anyone who has worked in a hospital has seen death, but working in a hospice meant I got to know death”\nTwenty years later I was working in a hospice in South Staffordshire. This part of my medical training has proven to be one of the most profound learning experiences of my life. Anyone who has worked in a hospital has seen death, but working in a hospice meant I got to know death. There is no other predicament like death, which will as intimately expose the frailty of human schema, the shape of family ties and relations, or the health of social and cultural mores underpinning our communal existence. Grief manifests with many faces. Grief will pull you together and break you up again in waves. For minorities, barriers that are entrenched at the community-palliative service interface can unfortunately further complicate the entire bereavement process.\nThere are a plethora of reasons as to why minority groups do not access palliative services or use hospices to the same extent as white British population. Lack of knowledge regarding availability of such services, what palliation constitutes – a common misperception being that palliative doctors help end lives, and uncertainty over whether palliation is compatible with religious and cultural beliefs are significant factors. Language barriers to communication between health professionals and minority patients, and perceptions of discrimination and unjust treatment based on previous encounters lead to distrust of health professionals, further contributing to inequity in accessing services.\nDue to various cultural and religious beliefs amongst many minority communities, there is also generally a preference to persist with life sustaining/lengthening treatment above opting for palliative routes of care aimed at preserving quality of life. This often means that by the time life-sustaining treatment is withdrawn, it is often too late to plan a death at home or in a hospice. Patients from minority backgrounds are less likely to have or even know about advanced care plans, advanced (legally binding) decisions to refuse life saving treatment and are more likely to refuse do-not-resuscitate orders. If we factor in language and cultural barriers, these conversations are all the more difficult to have when the time comes. The complexity of planning end of life care is further compounded by collective rather than individual decision making in many minority communities and further disempowerment of the individual by communicating through various family members either due to lack of available translator services or assuming this is a cultural norm which should prevail over other ethical considerations.\nFrom personal experience, health services are hit and miss at accommodating ethnic and religious minority deaths. One of the hospitals I worked for trained their doctors on the importance of punctually completing death paperwork to facilitate Muslim timelines for funeral arrangements, and also how to complete paperwork for patients wishing to be repatriated after death. Some city councils with large Muslim populations have also arranged emergency services for registering deaths out of office hours to prevent delays in burial. Other hospitals, given the enormous pressures on resources, have no quiet rooms on many wards to accommodate the large influx of extended family members that often arrive when a South Asian patient dies.\nOne experience in particular still haunts me, when a pre-arranged translator for a rapidly deteriorating Romanian patient failed to turn up for the third day in a row, forcing me to use (the very poorly adapted) Google Translate to try and record his wishes while he still had mental capacity, and discuss his preference for cremation or burial after death. Through broken, grammatically incorrect and linguistically insensitive phrases, I had to explain we could not cover the costs of repatriation and hope he understood. I wish I could say this was the exception, I wish I could say these experiences were becoming more infrequent, I wish as health professionals we weren’t growing accustomed to failing our patients from minority backgrounds on a regular basis.\nCulturally sensitive bereavement services that do not fall into the trap of making assumptions based on the religious or cultural background of the grieving families are practically unheard of. Despite coming from a fairly homogenously white, Anglican, quasi-rural background, the patients I admitted to the hospice on a daily basis wildly differed in their preferences for end of life care. From spiritual beliefs and rituals, their hopes and fears, the extent of desire for family involvement in decision making, use of alternative medicine, relationship with palliative care medications, to what extent they had come to terms with dying, their beliefs about death and wishes regarding their legacy, to whether they wanted psychological or spiritual input, every lengthy conversation I had was different. Even the same patient, throughout their inpatient admission, would undergo a 180-degree turn regarding a particular belief or decision and it was only through constant discussion that as a medical team we were able to ascertain this.\nIgnoring for a moment class, gender, disability and sexuality (which are unfortunately replete with the same institutionalised inequality), the white British patient is treated as a clean canvas upon whom we do not impress our prejudices or limited assumptions of what we presume to be that individual’s cultural, religious or personal beliefs and practices. Similarly, while it is important to have some knowledge of the cultural and religious frameworks in which various minority groups are embedded, this knowledge should only go as far ensuring our conversations are conducted with tact and sensitivity and help to empower the individual through the planning and treatment process by effectively removing impediments in communication. It should not form further stereotypes and assumptions about minority communities and inadvertently drown out the individual’s voice, which unfortunately I, and many others have experienced during our careers.\nIt can be a difficult line to tread and with lack of cultural knowledge training at medical schools across UK, with little implicit bias training for NHS staff and limited research into palliative care provision for patients of minority backgrounds, the blueprints needed to build such conversations and accommodate the needs of minority patients, are scant. Until then, palliative care services will continue to struggle to provide good end of life care to minorities in this country.\nMashal Iftikhar is a junior doctor training in NHS.

39	What is the Kessler Syndrome and why is it dangerous?	The Kessler Syndrome is a scenario where the volume of space debris in Low Earth orbit becomes so high that objects in orbit are frequently struck by debris, creating even more debris and greater risk of further impacts. It is especially dangerous due to its 'domino effect' - any collision creates shrapnel that can cause further damage, potentially making Low Earth Orbit impassable and rendering space exploration and satellite use unfeasible for many generations.	"['The Kessler Syndrome is a scenario, proposed by NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler in a 1978 publication, where the volume of space debris in Low Earth orbit is so high that objects in orbit are frequently struck by debris, creating even more debris and a greater risk of further impacts. The implication of this scenario is that the escalating amount of debris in orbit could eventually render space exploration, and even the use of satellites, unfeasible for many generations.\nDebris generation and destruction\nEvery satellite, space probe and manned mission has the potential to create space debris. As the number of satellites in orbit grows and old satellites become obsolete, the risk of a cascading Kessler Syndrome becomes greater.\nFortunately, at the most commonly used Low Earth Orbits residual air drag helps keep the zones clear. Collisions that occur under this altitude are also less of an issue, since the energy lost in the collision results in fragment orbits having perigee below this altitude.\nAt altitudes above the levels where atmospheric drag is significant, lifetimes before orbital decay are much greater. Slight atmospheric drag, lunar perturbations, and solar-wind drag can gradually bring debris down to lower altitudes where fragments finally re-enter, but at very high altitudes this can take millennia.\nThe Kessler Syndrome is especially insidious because of the ""domino effect"" and ""feedback runaway"". Any impact between two objects of sizable mass spalls off shrapnel debris from the force of collision. Each piece of shrapnel now has the potential to cause further damage, creating even more space debris. With a large enough collision (such as one between a space station and a defunct satellite), the amount of cascading debris could be enough to render Low Earth Orbit essentially impassable.\nThe Kessler Syndrome presents a unique problem to human space travel. Space debris are very difficult to deal with directly, as the small size and high velocities of most debris would make retrieval and disposal impractically difficult. Given thousands of years, most debris in Low Earth Orbit would eventually succumb to air resistance in the rarefied atmosphere and plunge to the Earth.\nAvoidance and reduction\nTo minimize the chances of damage to other vehicles, designers of a new vehicle or satellite are frequently required to demonstrate that it can be safely disposed of at the end of its life, for example by use of a controlled atmospheric reentry system or a boost into a graveyard orbit.\nOne technology for the bigger fragments that can be tracked is the laser broom, a multimegawatt land-based laser that could be used to target fragments. When the laser light hits a fragment, one side of the fragment would ablate, creating a thrust that would change the eccentricity of the remains of the fragment until it would re-enter harmlessly.\nKessler Syndrome in popular culture\nGeneration of space debris to the point where space travel is impacted has been a subject of several works of science fiction, including various movies and novels.\nPublished - July 2009\nPlease see some ads intermixed with other content from this site:\nCopyright 2004-2018 © by Airports-Worldwide.com']"	['<urn:uuid:cc1f6f89-a2a0-4a29-84eb-47b723ac2175>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	10	74	515
40	uae vertical farming production sustainability	Vertical farming in UAE has shown significant production benefits, producing 5-10 times more crop quantity, with Abu Dhabi achieving agricultural production worth Dh13.7 billion in 2020, a 12% increase from 2019. From a sustainability perspective, Masdar City's urban farming initiatives are addressing food security while using 72% less power and 35% less water than typical villas, displacing an estimated 63 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually.	"[""Masdar City's steel urban allotments could help solve food security crisis\nVertical farms and eco-villas to be profiled at Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week could help UAE grow more of its own crops\nAbu Dhabi’s Masdar City is piloting a project that could see urban communities growing their own food in an allotment, but with a very modern day twist.\nA pilot future farming facility built from recycled shipping containers could solve the region’s food production crisis by allowing communities to grow produce, despite the harsh desert climate.\nMasdar City, which was built to be one of the world's most sustainable communities, is collaborating with Madar Farms, who try to find sustainable solutions to the GCC's food security issues, to develop vertical farming inside shipping containers. They are equipped with hydroponic systems that can operate using minimal water.\n“With the world’s population expected to exceed 9 billion by 2050, efficient and sustainable production and distribution of food is becoming increasingly important,” said Yousef Baselaib, executive director of Masdar City.\n“This is particularly true for countries with arid climates and harsh environmental conditions like ours.”\nThe 1.5 acre plots inside each 12-metre container have the capability to grow crops using less than 40 litres of water a day.\nThe crops are constantly monitored by the latest technology within a sealed environment, shortening the growing cycle.\nTemperature and carbon dioxide levels can be regulated via a mobile phone app, with an automated nutrient delivery system to produce the best possible results.\n“We have begun investing in technologies and partnerships focused on sustainable agriculture with the aim of commercialising farming techniques,” said Mr Baselaib.\n“These systems can be applied to urban areas to encourage people in the UAE to eat home grown produce.”\nFood security and sustainable farming will be one of the key focuses of Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW), which begins on Saturday.\nThe technology and methods used by Madar Farms use approximately 95 per cent less water and land than conventional farming, making the company one of the most efficient and sustainable growers in the GCC.\nThe initiative joins other similar schemes such as one run by Agricool in Sustainable City in Dubai, where they are growing fresh strawberries for the local community in hydroponic grow room inside shipping containers.\nMasdar City first engineered ideas of productive landscapes in 2008 to address food security issues.\nSince then, community gardening plots have been developed to allow for plant research, agricultural education and to encourage people to grow their own food.\nMasdar’s agricultural strategy hopes to encourage traditional farming methods and the growth of indigenous plants.\nAn eco-villa has been built in the eco-friendly city to show how green living could be used in the home on a wider scale.\n“The villa is an example of Masdar’s commitment to sustainability and is a pilot project conceived as a template for affordable, energy- and water-efficient residential villas,” said Mr Baselaib.\nBy this month, they also hope to have implemented home farming technologies and they will be showcasing the project at ADSW.\nThe eco-villa uses about 72 per cent less power and 35 per cent less water than a typical villa in Abu Dhabi, displacing an estimated 63 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually.\nDuring ADSW, Masdar will also show other projects focused on vegetable and livestock farming, water harvesting and recycling, waste recycling and how to use energy for cooking.\nLess than 1 per cent of the region is arable and permanent crop land, and more than 40 per cent of the UAE’s food is imported.\nImporting that volume of food will cost more than US$100 billion (Dh367b) by 2030.\nMore than 40 per cent of natural water sources have been lost in the past 20 years through overuse and despite water scarcity, 84 per cent of water is used for agriculture and irrigation, which contributes less than 1 per cent to GDP.\nThat has left conventional farming unsustainable in the UAE, forcing the development of alternative models.\nMasdar has paired up with the UAE Office for Future Food Security to rubber stamp its commitment to addressing the most important environmental issues likely to impact the nation.\nOther sustainable farming methods are being developed in a Central Park project, using vertical farming techniques, solar-powered greenhouses, a self-contained farmers’ market and edible maze.\n“Tackling the challenge of food security is a priority for Masdar and one that we are addressing in a holistic manner by looking at solutions in energy, food and water,” said Mr Baselaib.\nUpdated: January 11, 2019 11:07 AM"", 'The agriculture sector is not predominant in UAE due to its geographical location. Moreover, the country is characterized by very little rainfall, extremely high temperatures, poor quality of soil, less arable land, and unavailability of satisfactory natural waterways, all of which justify the non-prevalence of the agricultural sector. The Government is taking various measures to improve the food security for its people.\nAgriculture sector analysis of the United Arab Emirates\nThe agricultural produce of the United Arab Emirates\nThe total arable land in UAE is only approximately 1600 square kilometers, out of the total land area of around 71,023 square kilometers. The majority of the land in the UAE is utilized for the production of dates. The country is among the top ten dates producer in the world and contributes to around 6% of the world’s date production (the climatic conditions of UAE support the production of dates in large quantities).\nThe other crops grown in UAE are tomatoes, cabbage, bougainvillea, tropical hibiscus, eggplant, mangoes, citrus fruits, etc. The key areas where plantation activities are carried out are Ras-Al-Khaimah emirate, coastal areas of Fujairah emirate, Al Ain and Liwa Oasis, and Abu Dhabi emirate.\nThe country depends heavily on the imports of goods\nApproximately 80% of food in the UAE is imported from other countries. In 2020, UAE imported roughly $11.8 billion worth of edible products. The commodities which are majorly imported by UAE are rice, nuts, wheat, along with numerous other products. Some key countries that provide agricultural products to the UAE are India, the United States, Canada, China, Saudi Arabia, etc.\nExport of the agricultural commodities\nIn 2020, UAE exported approximately $10.6 billion worth of agricultural products, of which raw tobacco, raw sugar, nuts, chocolates, and dried legumes form the significant part of total agricultural exports. In 2020 the major countries to which the UAE exports agricultural products were Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Oman, Somalia, and Iran.\nChallenges in the Agriculture Sector of the UAE\nDue to the country’s geographic location, more than one-third of the land is covered with sand. Deserts, along with it, bring plentiful factors that detriment to the agriculture sector’s growth and sustainability.\nChallenges related to soil\nLow quality of soil\ngood quality soil is essential for agriculture. There are around 13 varieties of soil found across the country’s seven emirates; however, the soil quality is very low compared to other nations. Due to heavy winds in the country, the soil gets easily transferred from one region to another, because of which no one soil can be specific to a particular region.\nFor instance, the winds blowing from the coast, sometimes carry with them White Calcareous Sand, which results in white soil being found in numerous regions of the country. Similarly, iron-rich red sand gets deposited as red soil. Grey soil can also be found in the country, formed by igneous rock. The degraded material of the sea also forms soil which is cream-colored calcareous/sea-shell rich soil.\nA unique category of soil found in the United Arab Emirates\nA new category of soil was found in the Al Dabaya region of Abu Dhabi. This soil found in the country’s coastal areas is exclusive to the country and is rich in anhydrite (CaSO4). The soil type was incorporated in the year 2014 in the 12th addition of US Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nChallenges related to the availability of natural water\nNon-availability of water for irrigation poses a severe threat to agriculture\nThe non-availability of sufficient water for growing plants has always been a topic of discussion in the UAE when considering the challenges in the agricultural sector. The country faces a lot of difficulties producing food with limited water resources. The availability of water in the region is continuously falling because of the increasing population, resulting in increased water consumption. Since the country’s economy is heavily dependent on tourism for revenue, an increase in the number of tourists directly impacts the consumption and availability of water.\nGiven the fact that UAE has very little rainfall, the exhausted groundwater used for farming is not replenished with rainwater. As a result, according to a survey, freshwater availability decreased from 238 trillion liters of water to only 10 trillion liters between 1969 and 2015.\nExtraction of fresh water from the ground\nhuge amount of groundwater is drawn out, because of which saltwater intrusion occurs. Many crops are very sensitive to saline water, due to which their production is hampered. To find less saline water for irrigation, the farmers have to dig deeper wells and use stronger pumps that use a lot of energy. This acts as a huge cost to the farmers and puts a big question on sustainable agriculture.\nUse of water that is treated in water treatment plants\nIn order to fulfill the water demand in agriculture, large-scale farmers use water that has been treated in water treatment plants to reduce the salinity. However, such water has a substantial long-term impact on soil quality and productivity. The treated water has gigantic amounts of chemicals that when used for irrigation contaminates the soil and the entire food chain. Micropollutants and pathogens can enter the soil and cause plant diseases.\nUse of wrong methods of irrigation\nMost of the farmers in the region use the traditional irrigation method. Due to high temperate, half of the water evaporates while watering the farms and reduces the amount of water for irrigation. The wrong way of irrigation increases causes a huge amount of wastage of water. Farmers should be taught to use sub-surface irrigation to reduce water loss through irrigation.\nMethods took by the Government to resolve the challenges\nDespite the various agricultural challenges faced by the country, the sector is still showing a growing trend since 1971 because of numerous efforts put in by the Government. The late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan gave an immense contribution and put in a huge amount of effort to develop the agricultural sector in the country. The Government is since then continuously taken significant steps to ensure food security for its people and make the country more sustainable. A few steps taken by the Government are:\n- Making and adopting various policies to address agricultural issues.\n- Promoting and encouraging the farmers to use sustainable and climate-smart agriculture or “AgTec”.\n- Increasing the production of local food items which are adapted to high and humid conditions.\n- Providing training to farmers regarding the adaptation of smart agricultural practices.\n- Providing funds, etc.\nIn case you missed it: Growing Tomatoes Organically, Cultivation Practices\nLaunch of the ‘National Food Security Strategy 2051’\nThe ‘National Food Security Strategy 2051’ was launched in November 2018 with the chief aim of- using such agricultural practices which increase the quantity of food produced sustainably, thereby ensuring food security for the country’s people. The strategy consists of 38 both long-term and short-term initiatives. The main aims of the strategy include:\n- Enhancing the local production of food\n- Entering into international partnerships with other countries to diversify sources of food,\n- Making policies that help to enhance the nutritious content of food\n- Making legislation to reduce the amount of waste\n- Making UAE the best in “Global Food Security Index” by 2051, and (vi) developing an all-inclusive national system to enable sustainable food production.\nUse of Hydroponics in UAE\nHydroponic is a method of farming where the soil is not required for growing plants, instead, mineral and nutrient-rich water is used for growing and cultivating crops. This farming method is quite beneficial for plant growers in UAE because it uses less water compared to the traditional way of farming and helps in conserving a huge amount of water (around 70% less water is used for cultivation).\nAdditionally, by using this method, the plant growers in UAE can use crop-specific nutrients since, each crop requires different types and levels of nutrition. To support the use of the hydroponic system, the government has launched several training programs and workshops to educate the farmers. UAE also has huge portable hydroponic shipping containers which are insulated and provide the required environment for growing crops.\nVertical farming is a plant cultivating technique where the different crops are grown vertically in stacked layers. Vertical farming is popular among UAE farmers since the country has very little arable land. Several firms are involved in vertical farming activity and they provide all the necessary resources required to make vertical farming successful in the country.\nThese firms have better planting facilities and trained experts. The UAE government is also supporting this farming technique and continuously providing huge funds for its growth. The largest indoor vertical farm is located in Abu Dhabi, which proves the support of the UAE Government. Vertical farming has numerous other benefits which facilitate the growth of plants in the UAE. This method is not affected by the climate in the region (the temperatures and humidity in the vertical farms are controlled), thereby reducing crop failure or crop loss.\nAdditionally, this method can be used all year round because of which the production of crops increases, and the problem of food security is also addressed. Vertical farming has been known to produce 5 to 10 times more crop quantity. In 2020, Abu Dhabi, a major agricultural area, achieved agricultural production worth Dh13.7 billion, around 12% more than the previous year, 2019.\nIn case you missed it: Vertical Vegetable Gardening Ideas, Models, Set Up\nThere are various other environmental benefits of vertical farming as well: (i) vertical farming technique reduces the use of fossil fuels because farm machinery, which causes pollution and depletes the natural resources, is not used, and (ii) the vertical farms in UAE are located near residential and commercial areas, thereby reducing the cost of transportation and reducing the pollution caused by vehicles, (iii) in vertical farms mostly led lights are used which use solar energy to generate electricity.\nThe Government provides incentives and funding for the development of agricultural technology\nThe government is providing enormous amounts of funds for the development of agriculture technology and as well as for supporting the ‘Ag-Tech’ firms. As a result, various private firms have launched digital platforms to address some of the agriculture sector’s issues. For instance, some ag-tech firms help in identifying & addressing the loopholes in the food supply chain.\nSuch firms aid in making the food supply chain simple and sustainable through the use of digital technology. Such technology helps in reducing food wastage and supports the local firms. Mobile apps have also been developed which help the farmers identify the plant disease and provide instant solutions.\nThe number of organic farms in the country is very less, because of which the Government is focusing on the growth of organic farms. As a result, only 34 organic firms in UAE cover an area of around 3905 hectares. The food produced on organic farms is of fine quality and chemical free.\nMajorly, the organic farms in the UAE use inter-cropping methods to resolve the problem of pest attacks. The food produced through organic farming tastes better, and such farming techniques also provide support to the local farmers. Government officials make frequent visits to the farms to identify the challenges faced in carrying out organic farming so that they can provide solutions to make organic farming a success.\nIn case you missed it: Organic Grapes Farming, Growing Practices\nFood Technology Valley has been launched in Dubai:\nThe Food Technology Valley was opened in May 2021 to achieve the aims of the “National Food Security Strategy 2051”. The food technology valley will help in addressing the agricultural challenges faced by the country by opening:\n- Technology and engineering labs related to agriculture\n- Research and Development center\n- Smart food logistics hub\n- Food innovation center. The Food technology valley will also consist of food factories, and start-ups, and will also provide training to specialists and help conduct research.\nEase in setting up business in UAE:\nThe UAE Government supports investment in the agriculture sector by providing several advantages to investors, such as\n- A large number of premises\n- Many free-zone areas such as DMCC, Jebel Ali Free Zone, etc.\n- No corporate tax\n- Simple business laws and regulations, and many more other benefits.\nIn the UAE, two types of licenses are issued to the business owners\n- Commercial license\n- Professional license\nThe commercial licenses are provided to those businessmen who are engaged in the trading of agricultural products such as\n- Trading of seeds\n- Trading of flowers and ornamental plants\n- Trading of tree seedlings\n- trading of pesticides, and many more trading activities\nThe professional license is provided to those businessmen who perform various agricultural activities and practices such as\n- Growing crops and gardening\n- Growing fruit and palm trees\n- Land preparation & irrigation system works & maintenance\n- Tree removal and planting services, and many more.\nThe rulers of different emirates regularly take several initiatives to plant a specific number of trees. The main aim of such initiatives is to prevent soil erosion. The UAE Government has also entered into various agreements and treaties relating to agriculture with other countries, such as\n- Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with India\n- Memorandum of Understanding with Irelands Department of Agriculture, Food, and Marine,\n- International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture with Italy, and many more\nIn case you missed it: Organic Dates Farming, And Cultivation Practices\nDespite various challenges and issues, UAE faces in the agriculture sector, the country has shown a growing trend. UAE has become one of the most technologically advanced agriculture countries due to numerous measures taken by the Government and authorities to promote the agricultural sector.\nArticle by: Vasudha Bhushan\n- Agriculture Sector Analysis of the United Arab Emirates: Overview of the Sector, Challenges Faced by the Sector, and the Methods Taken to Resolve the Challenges\n- How to Start Duck Farming from Scratch: A Detailed Guide for Beginners\n- 17 Key Rules for Effective Organic Farm Management: From Planning to Reduce Production Cost\n- Pineapple Farming/Production in USA: How to Start, A Step-by-Step Guide to Planting to Harvesting\n- 14 Key Rules for Effective Rabit Farm Management: From Planning to Reducing Production Cost\n- How to Start Pig Farming from Scratch: A Complete Guide for Beginners\n- 19 Key Rules for Effective Goat Farm Management: From Planning to Reducing Production Cost\n- How to Start Dairy Farming From Scratch: A Complete Guide for Beginners\n- 16 Key Rules for Effective Sheep Farm Management: From Planning to Reduce Production Cost\n- Home Hydroponic Farming for Beginners: Check How This Guide Helps to Start and Set up Soilless Garden from Scratch\n- How to Start Country Chicken Farming from Scratch in Andhra Pradesh: A Step-By-Step Guide for Beginners\n- How to Start Cucumber Farming in USA: A Step-by-Step Guide to Planting to Harvesting\n- How to Start Broccoli Farming in USA: A Step-by-Step Guide to Planting to Harvesting\n- How to Start Honey Bee Farming/Beekeeping from Scratch: A Complete Guide for Beginners\n- How to Start Poultry Farming from Scratch: A Detailed Guide for Beginners\n- Texas Agriculture: Soil, Farmland Facts, and Department of Agriculture in Texas\n- Homemade Fertilizer for Vegetable Garden – A Detailed Guide for Beginners\n- How to Start Bell Pepper Farming in the USA: Production, and A Step-by-Step Growing Guide for Beginners\n- Almond Farming/Production in the USA: How to Start, A Step-by-step Guide to Planting to Harvesting for Beginners\n- How to Control Aphids on Plants Naturally and Organically: In Vegetables, Fruits, Herbs, and Flowers\n- Indian Gardening in the USA: For Home, Containers, Backyard, Vegetables, Flowers, Herbs, and Fruits\n- How to Start Grapes Farming in the USA: Production, and A Step-by-Step Growing Guide for Beginners\n- 19 Key Rules for Effective Dairy Farm Management: From Planning to Reduce Production Cost\n- How to Water Your Garden with Solar Power: For Home Gardening, Greenhouse, Polyhouse, and Outdoor\n- How to Start Goat Farming from Scratch: A Complete Guide for Beginners\n- 16 Key Rules for Effective Shrimp/Prawn Farm Management: From Planning to Reduce Production Cost\n- How to Grow Okra from Seed to Harvest: In Pots, On the Ground, A Full Detailed Guide for Beginners\n- Goshala Registration and Preparation of a Project Report: For Seeking Government Assistance for Subsidy and Procurement of Land for Goshala\n- How to Start Rose Farming in the USA: A Step-by-Step Production Guide for Planting to Harvesting\n- 17 Key Rules for Effective Piggery Management: From Planning to Reduce Production Cost\n- Best Season to Grow Onions at Home in India: in Pots, Terrace, Apartment Balcony, and Backyards\n- 12 Key Rules for Effective Poultry Farm Management: From Planning to Reducing Production Cost\n- How to Start Fish Farming on Terrace at Home: in Tanks on Small Scale, and a Guide for Rooftop Fish Farming\n- Top 19 Steps/Ways/Methods to Boost Lettuce Yield: How to Increase Production, and Quality\n- How to Start Tomato Farming in the USA: A Step-by-Step Production Guide to Planting to Harvesting\n- Top 15 Steps/Ways/Methods to Boost Hazelnut Yield: How to Increase Production, Size, and Quality\nThis information Agriculture Sector Analysis of the United Arab Emirates: Overview of the Sector, Challenges Faced by the Sector, and the Methods Taken to Resolve the Challenges appeared first on AgriFarming']"	['<urn:uuid:772be99b-d892-4a8b-a116-ec33a2c83827>', '<urn:uuid:9d09dbfd-463d-4850-93a0-98a4119c4954>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	5	65	3650
41	what clouds found near 30 doradus c	Five CO (molecular) clouds were found distributed along the western shell of 30 Doradus C, and three HI (atomic) clouds were located at the northwest, southwest and southeast of the superbubble.	"['(Phys.org)—An international team of astronomers has uncovered molecular and atomic gas clouds associated with the superbubble known as 30 Doradus C, which is located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The findings were presented Jan. 8 on the arXiv pre-print repository.\nCalled superbubble or supershell, 30 Doradus C is a bright X-ray cavity in the LMC with a diameter of approximately 300 light years. Although it was well studied at different wavelengths that revealed its shell-like morphology and the presence of six stellar clusters, the interstellar gas associated with this superbubble has not been thoroughly investigated yet.\nDue to its proximity and face-on inclination to Earth, LMC serves as an excellent laboratory for studying various types of shells and their environments. This galaxy offers a great opportunity to observe interactions between shockwaves and the ambient interstellar gas, which could help scientists to better understand the origins of high energy radiation and cosmic-ray acceleration in supernova remnants.\nAn observational campaign to investigate these interactions was carried out between July 2014 and April 2015 by a team of researchers led by Hidetoshi Sano of the Nagoya University in Japan. The scientists used the Mopra 22-m radio telescope of the Australia Telescope National Facility to observe the 2.6-mm CO line emission at 115 GHz, and analyzed the 21-cm HI lines toward 30 Doradus C.\n""We analyzed the 2.6 mm CO and 21 cm HI lines toward the Magellanic superbubble 30 Doradus C, in order to reveal the associated molecular and atomic gas,"" the paper reads.\nIn result, the researchers found five CO clouds distributed along the non-thermal X-ray shell in the west and three HI clouds located at the northwest, southwest and southeast. They also noted that thermal X-rays are brighter in the eastern shell, where there are no dense CO and HI clouds, while the western shell has these dense clouds and no evidence for thermal X-rays.\nThe team assumes that it is likely that the non-thermal shell was created by multiple supernova remnants during the last few thousand years. Moreover, the observations revealed that the non-thermal X-rays are clearly enhanced around the molecular clouds, what allowed the researchers to draw conclusion that it is a possible evidence for magnetic field amplification via the shock-cloud interaction.\n""The large velocity difference between the CO cloud surroundings and the inter-cloud space will enhance turbulence and magnetic field strength via the shock-cloud interaction. According to the three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, the magnetic field strength will be amplified up to mG,"" the scientists wrote in the paper.\nThe researchers hope that further radio observations will reveal the interstellar molecular and atomic gas distributions at higher resolution as well as the details of the shock-cloud interaction. They also noted that future studies of 30 Doradus C with the Cherenkov Telescope Array will detect and resolve gamma-ray flux associated with the molecular cloud what should enable probing the allow diffusion of cosmic-rays into the associated dense interstellar medium.\nExplore further: Image: The Magellanic Clouds and an interstellar filament\nMore information: Discovery of Molecular and Atomic Clouds Associated with the Magellanic Superbubble 30 Doradus C, arXiv:1701.01962 [astro-ph.GA] arxiv.org/abs/1701.01962\nWe analyzed the 2.6-mm CO and 21-cm HI lines toward the Magellanic superbubble 30 Doradus C, in order to reveal the associated molecular and atomic gas. We uncovered five molecular clouds in a velocity range from 251 to 276 km s−1 toward the western shell. The non-thermal X-rays are clearly enhanced around the molecular clouds on a pc scale, suggesting possible evidence for magnetic field amplification via shock-cloud interaction. The thermal X-rays are brighter in the eastern shell, where there are no dense molecular or atomic clouds, opposite to the western shell. The TeV γ-ray distribution may spatially match the total interstellar proton column density as well as the non-thermal X-rays. If the hadronic γ-ray is dominant, the total energy of the cosmic-ray protons is at least ∼1.2×1050 erg with the estimated mean interstellar proton density ∼60 cm−3. In addition the γ-ray flux associated with the molecular cloud (e.g., MC3) could be detected and resolved by the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). This should permit CTA to probe the allow diffusion of cosmic-rays into the associated dense ISM.']"	['<urn:uuid:04698bd1-6ef1-4531-bcb3-ff4ede42ab5e>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	7	31	695
42	counseling addiction treatment certification requirements	For addiction treatment professionals, there are two main pathways: Peer recovery specialists must have personal recovery experience and complete certification through Ohio Mental Health services with 40 hours of training. Licensed Professional Counselors require more extensive credentials including a master's degree in counseling with 60 graduate semester hours, 2 years/3,000 hours of supervised experience, and passing the NCE, CRCE, or NCMHCE exam. Both roles can provide addiction treatment services, but LPCs have a broader scope including assessment, diagnosis, and treatment planning, while peer specialists focus on support through shared experiences and helping clients maintain sobriety.	['A huge part of addiction recovery is finding a connection and building relationships with people based on shared experiences. That is exactly what clients at Community Assessment and Treatment Services (CATS) can find within its new Peer Recovery Support Specialist Program.\nPeer recovery support specialists can offer unique insight because they know exactly what the clients at CATS are going through – because they’ve been through it themselves. For CATS, a requirement of the position is “lived experience with a mental health and/or substance use disorder and (the support specialist must be) both actively engaged in their own recovery and in a position to engage in a supportive relationship with others who are embarking on their recovery journeys.” Additionally, the peer support specialist must be able to take from their own experience and use it to “instill hope that recovery is achievable and to assist the person in discovering and directing their own unique path to recovery.”\nEugene Platt is currently on his 12th year in recovery, and Lizzette Jordan has been in recovery for 27 years. They use the knowledge, experience and expertise they’ve garnered through their years of sobriety to help the clients at CATS as the program’s first peer recovery support specialists.\nAt CATS, Eugene and Lizzette work with clients in the intensive outpatient or sober living program to keep them on track with their recovery. While part of their job is to offer encouragement and support, they also help their clients to engage in all activities that promote recovery, self-determination, self-advocacy, well-being and independence, which includes transporting clients to meetings, jobs, doctor’s appointments and more.\nBenefits of the Peery Recovery Support Specialist Program\nBecause they are able to connect with clients on a personal level, Eugene and Lizzette are able to form a strong connection to the people whom they support. They provide one-on-one counseling and service, but the most important thing they can offer is a trusting ear and shoulder to lean on.\n“Out of everything we can offer, the biggest thing is someone to talk with,” Eugene said. “What we’ve gone through with our addiction and where we are at makes the biggest impact. I can share myself, my thinking, my feelings and my actions, and they know we’re on equal footing.”\n“What I do is encourage and offer hope, they’ve told me that I sometimes go into mama mode, because I make them feel loved, respected and make them have a sense of self worth, which they’ve never had before. It is important to have a listening ear to let them know that someone is listening.”\nAnother important aspect of the peer recovery support program is helping clients become self-sufficient. Lizzette and Eugene work to help their mentees see that there is hope, accountability and fun on the other side of addiction. They do that by taking them to meetings and recovery outings, but also by teaching them how to use the bus or public transportation system so that they can get themselves to work or meetings without relying on their peer support specialist or sponsor.\n“After building a relationship with my peers, I, like a mother bird, will kick them out of the nest so they can fly on their own, in the hope that they will put their recovery first.”\nPaying It Forward in Recovery\nFor Lizzette and Eugene, they say their role is also therapy for them. It allows them to give back. They both realize they would not be here today if it wasn’t for someone giving them a second chance, and they now relish the opportunity to give that hope to the people just starting their recovery journey.\n“Our work is like therapy for me too,” Lizzette said. “Because I see myself in my peers, it is still an eye-opener of how far God has brought me as well as where I have no desire to go back too. So my greatest reward beside helping others is witnessing my peers blossom into beautiful butterflies, being an extension cord in a sense to keep them connected to a new and different way of life. What joy it brings!”\n“If I can see one man or one woman get through one day without using drugs or alcohols, that’s my reward for doing this,” Eugene said. “I don’t look at this as a job, but based on my life experience, I am on assignment. I try to be better than what I was yesterday, so this assignment is to share my experience, strength and hope with another struggling addict. I want the struggling addict and their family who is going through it with them to know that there is hope at CATS. Because if I didn’t have hope or my people had given up hope on me, I don’t believe I would be here without it. Hope is necessary, and it is here!”\nMore About Peer Recovery Support Specialists\nIn addition to being recovering addicts, peer recovery support specialists are also professionally trained and certified. They must pass testing and a certification process through the Ohio Mental Health and Addiction Services. There is online training and 40 hours of in-person training that must be documented and observed. The certification also needs to be renewed every two years.

43	silk yarn versus cotton fabric processing steps	Silk yarn processing involves multiple steps: starting with cocoon formation by silkworms, followed by reeling where cocoons are dipped in boiling water to extract filaments, then dyeing the yarn in various hues, and finally weaving into finished products like sarees. Cotton fabric processing, on the other hand, focuses on the scouring stage which requires specialized agents like silicates, linear alkyl benzene sulphonates, and phosphates to remove impurities. The scouring process is carried out in iron vessels called kiers through three steps: saponification, emulsification and detergency, with careful consideration of properties like foaming tendency and viscosity.	['A journey to the land of silk-makers in and around Bangalore threw up a whole lot of surprises. The trip organised by Carnelian, a company that organizes heritage tours and walks, revived memories of my class X Economics project which co-incidentally was on sericulture.\nIf you thought the story behind the making of exquisite silk is as fascinating as the fabric, you couldn’t be more wrong. Behind every silk saree is the sacrifice of thousands of silkworms and the sweat and toil of hundreds of men and women.\nInside a grainage\nStack of baskets containing cocoons\nAn indigenous method of controlling temperature – An earthen pot containing water suspended from the roof.\nWe set off on a bright Saturday morning to Vijayapura, a town outside Bangalore. Our first stop was at a grainage. Grainages are temperature-controlled facilities where cocoons are kept under controlled temperature conditions till the pupa emerges from them as moths after about a week. The Bombyx mori moth is the key player in the making of silk in Karnataka.\nYellow and white cocoons\nFemale moths with eggs kept in a dark room.\nThe grainage had cocoons of two hues – cream and white. Male and female moths are allowed to mate. Mr Manjunath, the owner of the grainage mentioned that from the two varieties of cocoon they only pick the males from one and the females from another. A female lays around 400-500 eggs usually 48 hours after mating.\nEggs hatch after 8 days. In case the demand for silk is less, the eggs are stored in a refrigerator to postpone hatching.\nA mulberry cultivation\nYoung silkworms feeding on mulberry leaves\nLittle worms that hatch from the eggs are then shifted to a larger facility called the chawki where they are fed tender mulberry leaves. Cultivation of mulberry leaves and rearing of silkworms go hand in hand. The mulberry leaves are the only food of the silkworms. Worms have to be nurtured with utmost care. Feeding is done thrice a day – morning, afternoon and night. During their life-cycle, silkworms go through four moulting phases or instars. During a moulting phase, the worms shed old skin and acquire a new one. When in the moulting stage, which lasts for almost a day, the worms should not be fed.\n18- day-old silkworms feeding on mulberry leaves. Only the leaves are eaten and not the stems.\nRearing silkworms is no easy task!\nCows feed on mulberry stems\nAww! Chomp chomp chomp after a heavy lunch\nWhen they are about 18 days old, the worms are shifted to a larger facility and are fed mature leaves. Stems of the leaves are fed to cattle.\nSilkworms in a chakri\nCocoons in the chakri\nWhen the worms are around a month old, they are shifted to chakhris that are housed in a spacious facility. In the chakris the worms, which are considerably bigger in size now, spin fine silk cocoons around them. A day after the cocoons are formed they are transported to the cocoon market.\nCocoon market at Sidlaghata\nWe visited the cocoon market at Sidlaghata which we were told is open throughout the year except on Independence and Republic Day.\nA worker carrying a huge bundle of cocoons to the reeling unit.\nMore cocoons on their way to the reeling units:\nThe cocoons were vanishing from the market at a steady rate. The buyers, most of them cycle-bound, were carrying huge bundles of them to the reeling units.\nInside a reeling unit\nCocoons being dipped in boiling water\nThe machine at the reeling unit is operated manually\nThe reeling units that we were shown into at Sidlaghata had hand-operated machines. In the reeling units, the cocoons are dipped in boiling water to facilitate easy extraction of silk filament. During this process the worms, which have now entered the pupa stage, perish. Many would be wondering why the pupae have to meet with such a gruesome end. The idea is to produce exceptionally high-quality silk. If the pupae turn into moths and emerge from the cocoon, the silk strand breaks resulting in multiple segments. Silk yarn spun after the moth emerges from the cocoon is known as Ahimsa silk. During his time, Mahatma Gandhi vehemently opposed killing silkworm pupae for silk. It was he who suggested production of silk from empty cocoons.\nSilk yarn produced at the reeling unit\nA certain amount of wastage occurs when silk is spun from the cocoons. Strands of wasted yarn are also used to weave fabric popularly called spun silk. Dead pupae are used as a source of protein. Consignments of them are also exported to South Korea where they are a popular delicacy.\nAfter doing a recce of the reeling unit we lunched at the sprawling Silver Oak Farm on the foothills of Nandi Hills. It felt awesome dining amidst the marvelous surroundings drowned in the chirps of birds. A little tortoise here was the centre of attraction. There were a lot of Alsatians too who were enjoying their afternoon siesta.\nSilk yarn being dyed at the dyeing unit\nSilk yarn dyed in various hues being left to dry.\nA hearty lunch later we drove off to a dyeing unit. From the reeling units, bundles of silk yarn are sent to the dyeing units (see picture above). Dyed yarn is left to dry in the open and later packed off to various weaving units.\nInside a weaving unit\nA weaver at work\nSilk yarn of brilliant hues wound around an axle in the loom.\nThe final stage in the making of silk is at the weaving units. Men and women operate complicated machinery to create spectacular sarees in diverse designs and hues. When you look at the looms you can’t help but admire the men behind the innovation. Weavers take around a day to set up each loom for a saree.\nFinished sarees on display\nIntricate work on a saree\nLooking back at the entire process I couldn’t help but feel sorry for the poor silkworms and the men and women who labour so hard. The only consolation is that sericulture is big business in Karnataka and feed millions of families of our rural brethren.\n1. Owing to their immense benefits, the mulberry plant and silkworm are fondly referred to as Kalpavriksha and Kamadhenu, respectively.\n2. A mulberry plant once planted lasts for nearly 25 years.\n3. 30,000 tonnes of cocoons are required to produce 2200 tonnes of raw silk.\n4. The length of a silk filament from a single cocoon is about 500 metres.\n5. Mulberry can be cultivated throughout the year.', 'Scouring is the chemical cleansing process which is either carried out at room or at a suitable high temperature with the addition of suitable wetting agents. The scouring process helps in removal of the waxes, oils, gums, and other impurities from the textile material and makes it water absorbent or hydrophilic. As the raw material for fabrics such as cotton contain 5% to 15% impurities natural or added, pre-treatment of the raw material is necessary before textile dyeing process. The scouring process mainly depends on the type of cotton, the cleanliness of cotton or textile fiber, the color of cotton and the twist of the yarn.\nAs scouring agents are used in cleansing action of fabrics these are in wide demand in textile industry. The growth of textile sector would act as a major driver for scouring agents market. The current market of scouring agents is mainly concentrated in developed regions of Europe and the U.S. and to a large extent in China. The current share of Asia Pacific is expected to increase with high potential demand from countries especially India and Bangladesh and several countries in Middle East showing high prospective growth in textile industry.\nScouring Agents Market: Key End Users and Applications\nScouring agents have numerous enviable characteristics such as excellent cleansing ability of natural fibers such as cotton and wool. The scouring agents contain abrasive powders of uniform size which make the refinement process faster. Scouring process involves three steps carried out in iron vessels called kiers. The three processes are saponification, emulsification and detergency.\nUsually scouring agent such as sodium hydroxide is used for scouring cotton fabric, however due to potential damage of cotton fabric by sodium hydroxide; biological agent such as enzyme is preferred. Scouring agents show low foaming and high performance nonionic detergent properties making them suitable for the preparation of cotton and synthetic fabrics. There are several scouring agents used for scouring purposes such as silicates, linear alkyl benzene sulphonates, alkyl phenol ethoxylates, phosphates, ethoxylated alcohols, fatty alcohol sulfates etc. As every scouring agent does not reflect optimum properties in every regard choice of scouring agents matters a lot for each fabric. The different properties that are reflected mainly include that of foaming tendency, viscosity, ability to work with enzymes and acids.\nScouring Agents Market: Region-wise Outlook\nThe emerging economies of Asia Pacific are expected to witness the fastest growth for scouring agents in the next few years. The chief reason for this is the growing demand for scouring agents in textile industry for pre-treatment of fabrics. The ever increasing population with high growth in demand for superior cleaning and better properties of the textiles will add the necessary demand for this market.\nAs the current market for scouring agents is concentrated in developed regions such as the U.S. and European countries, the gradual recovery from the sluggish growth will help this market to show a positive trend in coming few years. The major shift in production of textile fabrics from developed to developing nations considering the cost parameter has led to the shift of the requirement of these chemicals to emerging economies.\nScouring Agents Market: Competition Landscape\nThe key players operating in the scouring agents market are companies like BASF SE, DuPont, Sasol, Cytec Industries, Whewell Chemical Manufacturers, Fineotex Chemical Ltd., Croda International, Clariant Corporation, Huntsman Corporation, Stepan Company, Galaxy Surfactants Ltd., The Dow Chemical Company, Ineos, Kimyagaran Emrooz Chemical Industries, and Cavalier Woolscourers.\nThe report offers a comprehensive evaluation of the market.

44	How has digital technology influenced artistic expression in photography, and what role does artificial intelligence play in modern creative processes?	In photography, digital technology has enabled new creative possibilities, allowing artists to combine techniques like digital collages, post-production editing, and manipulation of photo-files to achieve desired artistic effects that go beyond what cameras can record. This evolution extends to the broader creative landscape, where artificial intelligence has become particularly impactful in music creation - for example, artists like Taryn Southern have produced entire albums using AI, becoming the first pop star to compose and produce an album entirely through artificial intelligence called 'I Am AI'.	['…is not hoping in a better world,\nit is more a trip in the hidden side of reality.\nNot really trying to change things,\nto make them appear what they’re not,\nbut more giving them back the poetry that belongs to them\nand that some kind of forma-mentis has taken them off…\n…maybe is trying to reestablish a short look on things,\nexactly like when we’re in a crowd looking for someone\nwe look always too far away…\n…maybe is a floating-in-the-mud sensation\nwhere actions are in slow motion…\nI have always heard that once the public recognizes the artist for a style, it must be adopted as a trademark and never abandoned in order to continue to be recognized.\nI am a photographer artist and photography, from its birth, is technology in the making where each change leads to different stylistic and narrative results.\nMan and his habitat in a broad sense are the object of my studio and it is through these that I express my art. I observe them and then reproduce them according to my sensitivity using the technique that most inspires me at that moment. Color, black and white, infrared, digital or analog, are all techniques that I have always used then combined with post production, that is a resumption of the creative process after the shot also by means of collages or pictorial interventions to produce images that go beyond that. that the camera was able to record in order to bring the result as close as possible to the reality perceived by the heart rather than that observed by the eye.\nSince I started photographing I have always been clear that the technique is there to help me express myself and not to set limits, hence my tendency to contaminate, add or subtract elements from the image to make it incisive in the desired manner. Because there is the image in its entirety and then there are the details, those highlighted by accentuating the definition and contrast to guide the eye; those details that once seen you can no longer do without them because they are discovered as essential protagonists of the image. In general, my subjects revolve around the landscape, be it urban or rural, the faces of people and the product of their inventiveness. I look for the imperfection to show its poetry.\nI was born in Roma in 1964 from Haitian father and Italian mother, lived in Roma (Italy), Aleppo (Syria), Amman (Jordan), New York (USA), Ahmedabad (India), London (UK) and Port au Prince (Haiti) where I lived for the last 21 years. Now I am back in Rome.\nI started working as an interiors professional photographer around 1988. I was working mainly with architects and magazines. In 1996 I moved to New York for 6 months and worked in a professional printing lab. There I learned some black and white printing techniques which I then used in 1998 when in Rome I had my first exhibition as an artist with « casalbruciatopiazzavittorio« , a photo-promenade along roman suburbian via Tiburtina. Those images were taken on 4×5 » black and white infrared film with a view camera.\nUrban landscape was very seducing to me, especially through the images of Gabriele Basilico. Then, when I moved to Haiti where was extremely complicated to use film in a professional way and digital was coming along, inspired by David Hockney’s photo collages, I was able to use the first digital reflex cameras obtaining a huge gain in quality and definition putting together several photo-files as digital collages, to get panoramic views. It was using that technique that I worked on Haitian interior design’s best seller book: Intérieurs d’Haïti and soon after on Port-au-Prince urban landscape project. In this latter I also added random out-of-scale people from other scenes to the city views. This work was exhibited several times and awarded in Bamako’s 5th photo biennial in 2005.\nThis digital seamless photo collage technique was then used to create portraits where facial features were taken from different people. These portraits were exhibited several times and eventually awarded at the Salon d’Art Contemporain de Montrouge in 2005 with the jury’s special prize.\nIn those years, as digital cameras technique was getting better and collages were no longer needed to obtain good « negative » files I gradually left behind the collage procedure and challenging myself, I started working on natural haitian scenery, a subject that I considered unworthy as widely employed in cheap postcards. After about ten years working on this subject, covering most of the haitian country, I was able to put together and print the book Peyizaj.\nThen happened that one of Richard Avedon‘s portraits, seen in a book years before, never ceased to work inside me. How to achieve that kind of powerful result? I so started to portrait people around me in Haiti. Sticking to The Master‘s technique, just the face and always on a white background. This work, partially shown in my 2012 Lugano exhibition, counts now more than 500 portraits of people I came across throughout my 21 years in Haiti.\nNext was the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.\nI was there. It hit me and my family and my friends and the city and the country. It was a very difficult moment. Magazines and art galleries immediately contacted me to have photos of the tragedy but it was impossible for me the idea to make money or even just success on the back of my own people showing and selling pitiful images to the world. I was so shocked that it took me several days to go and take photos of the disaster. Eventually I did, trying to be as silent as I could. No experimentalism had to be applied. I owed those scenes of death a maximum of respect.\nSo, as all buildings were lying as corpses or too weak and unreliable to live in, people found alternative ways to house themselves. Each little piece of flat green in the city became a displaced tent camp. Those camps stroke me immediately for their grace, lightness and dignity.\nIn 2011 I started to work on Made in Ayiti portraying objects and tools used by people for their street business, made out of recycled material. This work became a book in 2016.\nIn 2019, with the help of Prince Claus Fund I started a project on the mystics in natural medicine in Haiti.\nThis project unfortunately ended prematurely due to the very complicated and dangerous socio-political situation in Haiti which forced me and my family to leave the country. Back in Italy I am once again fascinated by the dynamics of urban developments and presently experimenting and trying to understand what these spaces have to tell about themselves.\nExhibitions, Publications and Awards', 'How Artists Are Embracing Digital Technology\nIt goes without saying, but we’ll say it anyway: We are in the digital age, a time when an (overwhelming) amount of information is available to many people, largely due to computer technology. This current wave of change, marked by the proliferation of technology and digital devices in everyday life, has had a profound impact on our individual lives and is visible in every aspect of human endeavor, including the arts, transforming creative economies across the world.\nArt history shows that artists have always sought new art forms and unusual means to express their artistic principles, and technology has over the years provided artists with new ways to express themselves. For without the invention of painting tubes, Impressionists like Claude Monet would not have painted such iconic art as Impression, Sunrise (1872). And without the silk-screen printing technology (invented by the little-known American portrait painter John G. Rand), would Andy Warhol’s Oeuvre collection have developed in the same rapid fashion? We think not.\nOver time, since the first digital art was created in 1967 by Kenneth Knowlton and Leon Harmonart, art and technology have become more and more intertwined, with many contemporary artists adopting new types of media to create their work. From laser-printed ceramics to code-generated paintings to music created by AI technology, creatives are using technology to push the boundaries of traditional practices.\nNowadays, artists don’t use digital devices merely as aids in their creative process; many art professionals are transforming the art world by leveraging cutting-edge technologies and tools as an art and design medium, allowing them to create striking, immersive, and highly engaging art pieces. From virtual reality, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence to digital designs and 3D printers, technologies have indeed disrupted the contemporary art and art market in so many different ways, changing how art is created, consumed, and shared in our connected world. With Assemblace, created by Umbrellium, an award-winning pioneer in urban design and technology, users can create light structures and floor drawings by moving through colored laser beams and smoke. Another impressively innovative digital art creation is Rising Colorspace, an abstract artwork painted on the wall of a Berlin gallery. This iconic painting, created by artists Julian Adenauer and Michael Haas, is always changing, thanks to a wall-climbing robot called a Vertwalker armed with a paint pen and a software program instructing it to follow a certain pattern. The robot is constantly overwriting its own work, cycling through eight colors as it glides up vertical walls for two to three hours at a time before it needs a battery change. “The process of creation is ideally endless,” Haas, one of the creators, explains. And, finally, there is Tilt Brush, Google’s VR painting technology, which is now at the Discovery Museum and currently blowing the minds of visitors. With Tilt Brush, visitors to the Discovery Museum can unleash their creativity with three-dimensional strokes, stars, and even fire in a 3D space, where your palette is your imagination and the possibilities are endless.\nThis digital revolution isn’t limited to painting. Creatives in the music industry also have been experimenting with modern technology, including artificial intelligence, to compose and perform music in ways that humans simply cannot. Bryan Eno, an English musician, released a generative version of his 26th studio album, Reflection, on an app that plays infinitely and changes the music depending on the time of day. Break Free is an AI-composed album by Taryn Southern, an American singer and songwriter. Southern was the first pop star to compose and produce an album entirely through AI, called I Am AI. We could go on, but you get the idea now. These fascinating stories of creative genius prove how technology is transforming the creative world and the perception of art (in all its forms).\nTechnology brings masterpieces closer to the audience, helping us understand the artistic vision and its history. We are excited to see where the application of advanced technology in art is going to take us next. Whatever the future holds, we are sure that it will continue to transform how artists express and share their creative force to inspire and influence the best of humanity. And Art Tech District, a haven for creatives and tech heads, will be here, providing the enabling environment for art and technology to flourish.']	['<urn:uuid:3168b1ea-f3f6-4e58-8031-b714694b9642>', '<urn:uuid:d31f7191-9e42-4af9-ba82-e356e7a09ea1>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	20	85	1856
45	How do power grids and natural ecosystems compare in terms of their resilience to disturbances and breakdowns?	Power grids and natural ecosystems share important similarities in how they respond to disturbances. Both systems can exist in different states (functioning or breakdown) and have critical tipping points. In power grids, system integration helps move power efficiently and provides redundancy, but makes the system more complex and vulnerable to breakdowns, especially during serious system stresses. Similarly, ecosystems can exist in desirable states (like thriving bee populations that pollinate flowers) or undesirable states (like declining bee populations). Both types of systems require mathematical modeling to predict their resilience and potential collapse points. For power grids, this helps anticipate blackouts, while for ecosystems, it helps understand how they might respond to disturbances like species extinction or global warming. In both cases, once they cross a critical tipping point, the breakdown can propagate through the entire system, though there is usually time for intervention before complete collapse.	"['Guaranteeing the Security of an Increasingly Stressed Grid\n- Written by Massoud Amin\nGrid communications and control systems are often thought to be much more securely firewalled than is actually the case. An effective remedial program begins with a thorough and clear-eyed assessment of all vulnerabilities; especially to intrusion via the Internet. Creation of an adequate security system requires a management culture that demands and respects attentiveness to security among all employees.\nBoth the importance and difficulty of protecting power systems have long been recognized, as noted in the January 2011 issue of this newsletter. The critical assets that must be accounted for include thousands of transformers, line reactors, series capacitors, and transmission lines. Physical protection of these widely diverse and dispersed assets is impractical and command control layers yield new benefits only if designed correctly and securely, posing additional challenges.\nAs a practical matter, electrical systems must be structured to withstand temporary loss of physical components, just as they must operate through spontaneous local outages; but that depends on defending control and communications against cyber attacks, be they terroristic, military, or criminal.\nAt the end of the 1990s, partly in reaction to cyber attacks in Brazil’s power system and partly in anticipation of Y2K, the Electric Power Research Institute launched a two-year Infrastructure Security Initiative. Before and after 9/11 (when I became responsible for research and development on infrastructure security at EPRI), we reached out to utilities and their vendors to share relevant information and develop action plans. We conducted ""red team"" studies of simulated cyber attacks on a variety of grid assets and developed protocols for secure communications between control centers, substations, and power plants.\nElectric power utilities typically own and operate at least parts of their own telecommunications system—oftentimes backbone fiber optic or microwave networks connecting major substations with spurs to smaller sites. We found that this can give rise to a false sense of security. PCs, for example, can be a vulnerable point when they link dedicated communications with operations control. And sometimes modem access could be readily attained using obvious passwords. Yet we saw reports and files claiming that systems were bulletproof.\nConsider the following conversation with two operators at a typical, multi-screen layout we had a couple of years ago concerning a five-year-old, gas-fired combined cycle power plant of 200–250 MW:\nDo you worry about cyber threats?\nNo, we are completely disconnected from the Internet.\nThat’s great! But this is a peaking unit. How do you know how much power to make?\nThe office receives an order from the ISO, then sends it over to us. We get the message here on this screen.\nIsn’t that message coming in over the Internet?\nSure, we can see all the ISO to company traffic… Oh! That’s not good, is it?\nAny telecommunications link that is even partly outside the control of the organization that owns and operates power plants, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, or energy management systems represents a potential pathway into the business operations of the company and a threat to the larger transmission grid. And as the number of documented intrusions and their level of sophistication continue to rise, it has become apparent that human response is often neither fast enough nor smart enough to effectively counter malicious code and denial-of-service attacks.\nA vivid example of just how insidious such attacks can be came last year with the Stuxnet malware, which evidently targeted Iran’s uranium enrichment operations. It did so by infiltrating standard SCADA and industrial control systems widely used in power systems and manufacturing facilities. Constructed in nested shells like a Russian doll, Stuxnet’s innermost ""payload"" ultimately took over logic controllers, so as to modify the way equipment ran, while remaining completely invisible to system operators. Control room screens would indicate normal operations, while machines spun wildly out of control and self-destructed.\nBefore Stuxnet had been fully analyzed, first by German cyber security experts, then by others who largely confirmed their conclusions, its outer shells had showed up in power systems and plants around the world. Though it appears to have done no damage (as intended), it showed just how vulnerable widely used control systems can be to highly sophisticated malware.\nLike any complex, dynamic infrastructure system, the electricity grid has many layers and is vulnerable to many different types of disturbances. While strong centralized control is essential to reliable operations, this requires multiple, high-data-rate, two-way communication links, a powerful central computing facility and an elaborate operations control center, all of which are especially vulnerable when they are needed most—during serious system stresses or power disruptions. For deeper protection, intelligent, distributed, secure control is also required, which would enable parts of the network to remain operational and even automatically reconfigure in the event of local failures or threats of failure.\nAccordingly, protection of the system requires a multi-layered effort. At the highest level of generality there needs to be a corporate culture that insists on adherence to procedures, visibly promotes better security, and sees that management is well informed. The security program must be up-to-date, complete, closely supervised, and must include vulnerability and risk assessments. Of course, employees must be screened and trained and emergency procedures must be rehearsed and drilled.\nPhysical assets need to be evaluated in terms of criticality and vulnerability to intrusion. IT security must include protection of wired and wireless networks and assessment of firewalls and process control systems, among other things. Very high-level mathematical modeling is required to guard against false data injection, detection of stealth attacks, risk estimation and impact analysis.\nAt the same time, as security programs are built and protections put into place, difficult choices will have to be made about how to handle a number of trade-offs.\n- Security versus efficiency. The specter of future sophisticated terrorist attacks raises a profound dilemma for the electric power industry, which must make the electricity infrastructure more secure, while being careful not to compromise productivity. Resolving this dilemma will require both short-term and long-term technology development and deployment that will affect fundamental power system characteristics.\n- Centralization versus decentralization of control. For several years, there has been a trend toward centralizing control of electric power systems. The emergence of regional transmission organizations, for example, promises to greatly increase efficiency and improve customer service. But we also know that terrorists can exploit the weaknesses of centralized control; therefore, smaller and local would seem to be the system configuration of choice. In fact, strength and resilience in the face of attack will increasingly require the ability to bridge simultaneous top-down and bottom-up decision-making in real time—fast-acting and totally distributed at the local level, coordinated at the mid-level.\n- Wider grid integration and increasing complexity. System integration helps move power more efficiently over long distances and provides redundancy to ensure reliable service but it also makes the system more complex and harder to operate. We will need new mathematical approaches to simplify the operation of complex power systems and make them more robust in the face of natural or manmade interruptions.\n- Dependence on Internet communications. Today’s power systems could not operate without tightly knit communications capabilities—ranging from high-speed data transfer among control centers to the interpretation of intermittent signals from remote sensors. But due to the vulnerability of Internet-linked communications, protecting the electricity supply system will require new technology to improve the security of power-system command, control and communications, including both hardware and software.\n- Investments in security. Although hardening some key components—such as power plants and critical substations—is highly desirable, providing comprehensive physical protection for all components is simply not feasible or economical. Dynamic, probabilistic risk assessments have provided strategic guidance on allocating security resources to greatest advantage.\nFortunately, the same core technologies that were developed to address other system vulnerabilities can strategically improve system security as well. But the electricity infrastructure will also require power system-specific advanced technology. Assuming that individual utilities are already taking prudent steps to improve their physical security, technology can help by increasing the inherent resilience and flexibility of power systems to withstand terrorist attacks as well as natural disasters.', 'While preparing soup, have you ever wondered at what point does a pot of boiling water start evaporating?\nNow, we know from basic physics that water can be of two states- liquid or gas.\nBut is it possible to determine the exact interaction and energy between the billions of water molecules that converts liquid to vapor?\nCentury-old theoretical physics dictates that we can reduce these billions of interactions and parameters to a very few observables. In this case basically just one -temperature. We can at all times, figure out the state of water when we measure the temperature.\nBut what about other complex systems such as the weather patterns, ecology, disease states etc.? These systems interact via complicated networks, with many members in each system intricately linked through one another. Is it possible to quantify the state of such complicated systems?\nThat is precisely the focus of a new study by a team of researchers, including an Israeli applied mathematician at the Bar-Ilan University, Dr. Baruch Barzel, one of the lead authors.\nDrawing comparisons [to other systems] similar to water\'s \'desired\' state of the liquid form versus an \'undesired state\' of an evaporated form, Barzel says, ""A system can be in a desirable state, such as bees for example which pollinate flowers and thrive. Or that bees could be in an undesirable state as is happening over the past decade with the decline in bee population.""\nAlthough we are presented with examples of systems residing in either of two states, sometimes the number of states could exceed two. How to reconcile the observations then?\n""In order to quantify which one of the states the system is going to be in- meaning either on it\'s way to extinction or thriving, you need to measure many parameters,"" remarks Barzel.\nThe team of researchers led by senior scientist, Dr. Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, at the Northeastern University has investigated a central tenet of any complex system behavior- how does a system with inherently many parameters respond to perturbation?\nThere are several forms of perturbation. For instance, weather patterns are disturbed in light of global warming. In another instance, an ecosystem may be affected if a particular species faces extinction or a new species is introduced in it.\nGiven such versatile scenarios with a rich repertoire of interaction within systems, in this study, the researchers have addressed a very pertinent problem- Can the systems withstand such perturbations or are they vulnerable? In other words, how \'resilient\' is a system and at what stage does it breakdown?\n""Metaphorically speaking, what we were looking for is an analogy for \'temperature\' in these systems; Basically what are the relevant number(s) that can quantify the state of an complex system and take the millions of parameters that we would need to know and crush them all down into a single parameter that determines- is this system going to be liquid? That\'s good. Or is it going to be gas?"" remarks Barzel.\nBut real life systems are seldom as straightforward as the two physical states of water. The bigger challenge here is not just analyzing the states of such multi-dimensional systems but also quantifying it. That\'s where mathematics comes to the rescue! The researchers used mathematical equations to construct models and map the original complex system onto a single dimensional system to accurately predict the system\'s resilience.\nIndependent experts have hailed the work of Dr. Barabasi and his team as a very important and useful discovery within and outside the exciting new field of network science. The current work has defied popular belief that differences between biochemical, ecological and other networks (modeled using certain equations) are too large for any single solution to fit so many types.\nDr. Robert May, former Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK government and currently a professor of Zoology at the Oxford University emphasizes the broad impact of such predictive studies, ""There has, over the past several decades, been much research on the way natural ecosystems can be threatened by human disturbances. Likewise, the recent bad behaviour of some major banking systems raises important questions about stability and complexity. Although not explicitly addressed by these authors, their work is in many ways paralleled by efforts to understand how banking systems might be made more resilient and thus better able to handle the kinds of problems we have seen over the past few years in that area.""\n""Barzel\'s work claims to bridge these differences by providing an incredibly broad solution to a very important and difficult problem. If experiments back up Barzel\'s theory, it will be recognized as one of the most important and useful discoveries,"" says Dr. Neo Martinez, Associate Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at University of Arizona, not directly associated with this study.\nTo illustrate the practical adaptability of their theoretical model, the researchers used it to study the resilience of multidimensional technological system- power grids.\nThe scientists used the loss of power in the Northeastern United States, in the wake of snowstorms every year as a motivation to test their results on the resilience of transformers.\nDr. Jianxi Gao, another lead author at Northeastern University expresses his amazement on the versatility of their model, ""That this theory can be applied to AC power systems to predict blackouts, surprises me very much, because AC power system is more complex than the ecological and biological systems.""\nAn independent expert, Dr. Shlomo Havlin, Professor of Physics at Bar Ilan University and not a part of this study, highlights the benefits of such predictive studies for complex systems, which could be highly resilient yet quite fragile, ""This paper helps us understand three crucial aspects: 1. What are the different states or phases of a complex system? For instance, the power grid can be at a functioning state or at blackout. 2. What are the precise transition points? e.g., what is the critical load beyond which the power system risks collapse. 3. What structural characteristics enhance a system\'s resilience, namely what changes in design would make the power grid more reliable? These are very important findings, for which we lacked a theoretical understanding until now.""\nThe scientists posit that systems could be very similar. The moment that they cross the tipping point (in the water example, when water ceases to be in its liquid state and transforms into the vaporized state), it might take some time for the system to die out.\n""For instance, it might take an epidemic a year to spread to a global scale or about 24 hours before a cell becomes pathogenic,"" says Barzel.\nBut there is always time for intervention and the current study is a call for it!\nNow, what comes next? As Barzel puts it, ""In the pot of water, it\'s clear. You turn down the gas. But how do you do it in the case of Zika or Ebola?""\nIn other words, \'how\' to efficiently intervene so as to stem a disease from spreading, cross the tipping point and develop into a global epidemic?\nIn order to address such pressing issues several research teams are trying to identify and study early warning signals for systems - in the case of boiling water those are the bubbles.\nSuch studies should serve as a wake up call in identifying emerging problems across various platforms from biology to infrastructure and formulating intervention strategies to create resilient systems.\nHowever, resilience could be a double-edged sword. ""Cancer is a resilient condition able to withstand many pressures. In such cases, we need to impact resilience in the negative direction!"" remarks Barzel.\nThe scientists are optimistic however that sometime in the near future, the stock market or flu forecast will be done accurately with the aid of mathematical models akin to the one used in this study. And there will come a day, when such predictions will not be futuristic events any more! We will depend heavily on those similar to our absolute reliance on weather forecast nowadays.\nSo what\'s next as far as some of the exciting real life applications of this model is concerned? ""Network science and applications to brain- that\'s the upcoming decade. If I am allowed to be a prophet and not a scientist for a second,"" remarks Barzel and adds that there are some caveats to it.\nEcosystems for instance, can benefit tremendously from similar studies. Martinez expresses the importance of ecology and its studies on networks that determine whether ecosystems continue to support human life with the food and oxygen we need, ""These networks range from the networks of pollinating insects that fertilize our crops to networks of feeding interactions among species that move carbon in our atmosphere and store it in soils and fossil fuels.""\nEcologists are always keen to explore the dynamic behavior of these networks. And the only way to \'predict\' the success or the failure of these networks and their impact on the environment such as global warming is via theoretical models and statistical methods.\n""If it passes the tests, Barzel\'s theory would have significantly advanced ecology and have helped us predict and hopefully better manage the resilience of ecosystems ranging from orchards to fisheries,"" adds Martinez.\nAccording to May, an understanding of the network characteristics is becoming increasingly important as humanity\'s impacts on natural systems grow- such as ocean acidity and/or global warming.\nAs evidenced from this study a theoretical model seems to be a successful predictor of a system\'s resilience and collapse, yet sometimes its implications could be quite profound.\n""Infrastructure just as much it seems to be a matter of lifestyle, in many cases it is life or death. There are fatalities in the Northeast every year due to power outage during harsh winter storms.

['Credit: Composite image by Jayanne English of the University of Manitoba, with NRAO VLA radio data from Silvia Carolina Mora-Partiarroyo and Marita Krause of the Max-Planck Institute for Radioastronomy. The observations are part of the project Continuum HAlos in Nearby Galaxies -- an EVLA Survey (CHANG-ES). The optical data were from the Mayall 4-meter telescope, collected by Maria Patterson and Rene Walterbos of New Mexico State University. Arpad Miskolczi of the University of Bochum provided the software code for tracing the magnetic field lines.\nThis image of the “Whale Galaxy” (NGC 4631), made with the National Science Foundation’s Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), reveals hair-like filaments of the galaxy’s magnetic field protruding above and below the galaxy’s disk.\nThe spiral galaxy is seen edge-on, with its disk of stars shown in pink. The filaments, shown in green and blue, extend beyond the disk into the galaxy’s extended halo. Green indicates filaments with their magnetic field pointing roughly toward us and blue with the field pointing away. This phenomenon, with the field alternating in direction, has never before been seen in the halo of a galaxy.\n“This is the first time that we have clearly detected what astronomers call large-scale, coherent, magnetic fields far in the halo of a spiral galaxy, with the field lines aligned in the same direction over distances of a thousand light-years. We even see a regular pattern of this organized field changing direction,” said Marita Krause, of the Max-Planck Institute for Radioastronomy in Bonn, Germany.\nAn international team of astronomers who are part of a project called the Continuum HAlos in Nearby Galaxies — an EVLA Survey (CHANG-ES), led by Judith Irwin of Queen’s University in Ontario, said the image indicates a large-scale, coherent magnetic field that is generated by dynamo action within the galaxy and spirals far outward in the form of giant magnetic ropes perpendicular to the disk.\n“We are a little bit like the blind men and the elephant, since each time we look at the galaxy in a different way we reach a different conclusion about its nature! However, we seem to have one of those rare occasions where a classical theory, about magnetic generators called dynamos, predicted the observations of NGC 4631 quite well. Our dynamo model produces spiralling magnetic fields in the halo that are a continuation of the normal spiral arms in the galaxy’s disc,” said Richard Henriksen, of Queen’s University.\nThe scientists are continuing their work to further refine their understanding of the galaxy’s full magnetic structure.\nThe image was made by combining data from multiple observations with the VLA’s giant dish antennas arranged in different configurations to show both large structures and finer details within the galaxy. The naturally-emitted radio waves from the galaxy were analyzed to reveal the magnetic fields, including their directions.\nThe scientists said the techniques used to determine the direction of the magnetic field lines, illustrated by this image, now can be used on this and other galaxies to answer important questions about whether coherent magnetic fields are common in galactic halos and what their shapes are.\nBuilding such a picture, they said, can answer important questions such as how galaxies acquire magnetic fields, and whether all such fields are produced by a dynamo effect. Can these galaxy halo fields illuminate the mysterious origin of the even larger intergalactic magnetic fields that have been observed?\nNGC 4631, 25 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Canes Venatici, is about 80,000 light-years across, slightly smaller than our own Milky Way. It was discovered by the famous British astronomer Sir William Herschel in 1787. This image also shows a companion, NGC 4627, a small elliptical galaxy, just above NGC 4631.\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National Science Foundation, operated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.\nThe results were reported in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.\nQuelle: The National Radio Astronomy Observatory', 'Are galaxies different from each other? Yes. They are as various as snowflakes. Consider this beautiful collection of just nine galaxies from NASA’s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer mission, aka WISE. Notice some galaxies’ round centers, and others’ elongated central bars. Notice we see some straight on, and others at an angle. In the image below, the infrared light collected in the WISE mission has been translated into visible colors. The shortest wavelengths are blue and the longest are red. The oldest stars appear blue, while pockets of newly formed stars have yellow or reddish hues. Meet these nine galaxies individually after the jump. The WISE mission – which was launched in December 2009 – has scanned the whole sky in infrared light. Check out this story about the complete WISE catalog, released in March, 2012.\nThe Whirpool Galaxy, or Messier 51 (M51)\nM51 is well known to amateur astronomers as a face-on spiral with a smaller companion, a dwarf galaxy called NGC 5195. Both can be seen through amateur telescopes. The companion is thought to have helped define and shape M51’s spiral arms. M51 is located 25 million light-years away in the direction of the constellation Canes Venatici. It is 81,000 light-years across, in contrast to an estimated 100,000 light-years for the distance across our home galaxy, the Milky Way.\nMessier 81 (M81)\nM81 is another galaxy well known to those who gaze skyward with telescopes. Its pronounced arms spiral into its core. WISE highlights areas where gas and dust have been compressed in the arms, leading to the formation of new stars. M81 is 12 million light-years away in the direction of the constellation Ursa Major, and 94,000 light-years across.\nSouthern Pinwheel Galaxy, or Messier 83 (M83)\nM83 is s a bit more than half the size of our Milky Way: 55,500 light-years across. Its overall structure is the Milky Way, with most of M83’s stars, dust, and gas in a flat disk ornamented by winding spiral arms. This galaxy is classified as a barred spiral because, in addition to a central bulge of stars, it has a central bar-shaped region of stars. It is 15 million light-years away in the direction of the constellation Hydra.\nNGC 628, or Messier 74 (M74)\nM74 has been called the perfect spiral for its exceptional symmetry. It’s also known for the lightweight black hole at its core. Most galaxies, including our Milky Way, have supermassive black holes at their cores – millions of solar masses collected in a small area – but the black hole in the center of M74 is thought to have a mass equal to only 10,000 suns. M74 is located between 24.5 and 36 million light-years away in the direction of the constellation Pisces, and is 100,000 light-years across.\nNGC 1398 is a barred spiral with a dense inner ring that surrounds a bright, central core. The ring is actually two spiral arms that are closed in on each other. In contrast to its well-defined center, this galaxy’s arms are patchy, or flocculent. It is inclined about 43 degrees away from an edge-on orientation, and has a diameter of 135,000 light-years. NGC 1398 is 65 million light-years away in the direction of the constellation Fornax.\nNGC 2403 is another flocculent, or patchy, spiral. It looks fuzzy in this image, and, indeed, this galaxy is veiled by gas and dust at visible-light wavelengths. But – because it sees in the infrared – WISE was able to reveal its spiral arms. In 2004, NGC 2403 was host to one of the largest supernova in recent decades — SN 2004dj was first observed in 2004 in Japan and was visible for 8 months. NGC 2403 is located 11.4 million-light years away in the direction of the constellation Camelopardalis, and is about 73,000 light-years across.\nSplinter or Knife Edge Galaxy, or NGC 5907\nNGC 5907’s face is angled at about 90 degrees from our view, so it appears edge-on and thin as a splinter, or knife. The faint green hue seen in the WISE composite is due to the halo of old stars that encircles the central region of the galaxy. The Splinter Galaxy is about 53 million light-years away in the directio of the constellation Draco, and is nearly 200,000 light-years across.\nBarnard’s Galaxy, or IC 4895 or NGC 6822\nBarnard’s Galaxy has only about one percent of the mass of the Milky Way. The galaxy’s irregular shape is dominated by a central bar of stars, whose appearance resembles that of the nearby satellite galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud. The prominent yellow blobs seen against the blue stellar background are sites of recent star formation. Barnard’s Galaxy is 1.6 million light-years away in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, and is only about 7,000 light-years across.\nHidden Galaxy, or IC342\nIC342 is difficult to see because it is behind our own Milky Way galaxy. WISE’s infrared vision reveals it, though. This galaxy’s nucleus, or core, is very bright at infrared wavelengths, due to a burst of new stars forming there. IC342 is located about 10 million light-years away in the direction of the constellation Camelopardalis, and is 62,000 light-years across.\nBottom line: The galaxies in our universe come in several basic types, but otherwise they are as different from each other as snowflakes. This post has photos and descriptions of nine different galaxies, from NASA’s Wise mission. The mission released its whole-sky catalog in spring 2012.']	['<urn:uuid:5f138ab9-5a4c-4e0a-92b7-11c3ff41de70>', '<urn:uuid:b9409d42-7f28-49d3-b0aa-2ddca6aeedd0>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	7	30	1559
47	boat harbour cleanup federal funding 2019	In May 2019, the federal government committed $100 million to fund a remediation project at Boat Harbour.	['A chronological history of Boat Harbour, Nova Scotia\nNorthern Pulp is going to shut down on Jan. 31, putting a stop to the flow of industrial wastewater into Boat Harbour\nJanuary 29, 2020, 5:45 pm ASTLast Updated: May 8, 2020, 10:41 am\nThe Northern Pulp mill in Boat Harbour is scheduled to shut down at the end of the month amid concerns about pollution and environmental racism after decades of effluent treatment.\nBut before 1960, Boat Harbour was an unpolluted tidal estuary on the Northumberland Strait in Pictou County, Nova Scotia. The estuary covered about 142 hectares and was used by the local Pictou Landing First Nation community for fishing, food and recreational purposes. Now, it is used as a waste treatment lagoon for a pulp mill. This began in the 1960s and has provided thousands of jobs.\nNow that the mill is close to shutting down, here’s the series of events that led to this point:\n- In 1964, the Scott Paper Company announces it wants to build a pulp mill at Abercrombie Point, Nova Scotia. It says the mill will discharge about 25 million gallons of effluent daily. The province agrees to supply clean water to the mill, adding it will provide a place for the mill to discharge its effluent.\n- In 1965, John Seaman Bates, chairman of both the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick water authorities, proposes Boat Harbour be used as a waste treatment plant. He claims it will protect Pictou County from further pollution. Pictou Landing First Nation is told the impact will be minimal and was persuaded to accept $60,000 for the loss of their rights to Boat Harbour. That amount is estimated as equal to $480,357.14 in 2019.\n- In 1966, a Truro engineer estimates a cost of $95,000 to switch Boat Harbour from a natural lagoon into a waste treatment lagoon.\n- In 1967, the Scott Paper mill is up and operating. It receives millions of litres of waste daily.\n- In 1968, Pictou Landing occupants make complaints about pollution from the effluent plant. They say it affects their health.\n- Two years later, in 1970, the provincial water commission hires the Montreal-based company Rust Consultants to investigate the Boat Harbour complaints. They say the Scott Paper mill needs to be upgraded, and that it needs to add aerators. The province signs a 25-year supply and waste treatment agreement with Scott Paper.\n- In 1986, Pictou Landing’s chief files a lawsuit against the federal government for using Boat Harbour for waste and neglecting the health of their people.\n- In 1990, several dead fish are reported below waste outfall from Boat Harbour.\n- In the early 1990s, the province was pressured by complaints from Pictou Landing occupants to fix Boat Harbour. It employs Jacques Whitford and Beak Consultants to research ideas around how to handle the mill’s waste.\n- In July 1993, the federal government signs a $35 million out-of-court settlement with Pictou Landing First Nation. A month later, the consultants propose five options to fix Boat Harbour’s problem. One was opening Boat Harbour to the strait for $30,000 and another was constructing a new treatment facility at an estimated cost of $82 million. The province chose to pipe treated waste from the first lagoon two kilometres into the Northumberland Strait, where it would be mixed into the seawater.\n- In 1995, Kimberly-Clark Corporation acquires the mill. The province promises to shut down Boat Harbour by 2005. The province also promises it would pay the environmental liability cost for the lagoon.\n- In 2001, Pictou Landing signs a memorandum of understanding with Kimberly-Clark allowing the company to continue using the lagoon while Pictou Landing is financially compensated.\n- In 2002, the province extends the lease of Boat Harbour until 2030.\n- In 2003, the Nova Scotia government submits an assessment of plans documents to the federal government to reopen Boat Harbour to the strait. In 2004, Neenah Paper takes over ownership of the mill.\n- In 2005, consultants say reopening Boat Harbour could make the lagoon eutrophic, a term used to describe a body of water experiencing a significant increase in algae growth.\n- In 2006, Pictou Landing First Nation and Neenah Paper modify the memorandum of understanding and set 2008 as a new cleanup deadline.\n- In June 2008, Northern Pulp takes ownership of the mill. The license for Northern Pulp to discharge waste to Boat Harbour expires but is renewed on a monthly basis. Province promises not to extend it beyond Dec. 31, 2008 without consulting Pictou Landing.\n- In March 2009, the First Nation cautions the province about further discharge without their approval. It says the action will be perceived as a violation of its constitutional rights. First Nation council members begin negotiating with the province and Northern Pulp.\n- Meetings are placed on hold because of a June 2009 provincial election. Meetings don’t resume until September 2009.\n- In March, the Nova Scotia government loans $75 million to Northern Pulp to purchase 475,000 acres of forest land from previous owner Neenah Paper. The government states the deal was made to protect jobs and support the Pictou County economy.\n- In April, Pictou Landing First Nation requests the government end Northern Pulp’s licence by June. June passes without the termination.\n- In September, Pictou Landing First Nation launches a lawsuit against the provincial government and Northern Pulp, demanding they build a new effluent treatment facility and clean Boat Harbour.\n- In October, the Halifax Media Co-op reports the Nova Scotia government drafted an offer called the “capacity building agreement” of $3 million to Pictou Landing to postpone their lawsuit, with the stipulation that they do not obstruct wastewater dumping for two years, and that the money not be used to fund their lawsuit.\n- In January, the federal government grants $28 million to Northern Pulp to fund better environmental practices at the mill.\n- In March, B.C.-based company Paper Excellence buys Northern Resources, Northern Pulp’s parent company.\n- In January, Pictou Landing community members vote 90 per cent against the $3 million capacity building agreement, as reported in a master’s thesis by Ella Bennett.\n- Northern Pulp receives orders from the Nova Scotia Department of Environment in March and November to cut air pollution and the smell of sulfur.\n- In April, the province lends Northern Pulp a $14.7 million repayable loan and a $2.5 million forgivable loan to improve air quality and create jobs.\n- In June, The Chronicle Herald reports a pipeline has been leaking untreated effluent into a wetland. Later that day, Northern Pulp releases a statement acknowledging the leak. The mill shuts down and Pictou Landing First Nation creates a blockade to the damaged pipeline. The protest ends after the Nova Scotia government issues an order stating that if Northern Pulp does not cut their emissions to the mandated standards, they will be shut down in May 2015.\n- In May, the Boat Harbour Act is passed by Nova Scotia. This states the facility must cease the reception and treatment of effluent by Jan. 31, 2020, shortening their previous lease which ran until 2030.\n- In September, Northern Pulp qualifies for an environmental assessment of their proposed plans for a new wastewater treatment facility. These plans can be approved, denied, or have more information requested by the provincial environment minister. The proposed facility will process mill wastewater with a sludge treatment facility, then send effluent through an underwater pipeline into the Northumberland Strait.\n- In July, hundreds gather in Pictou County for an air and land protest against the newly proposed pipeline.\n- In October, a survey boat mapping Northern Pulp’s potential pipeline is blocked by fishermen and forced back to shore.\n- In October, Northern Pulp confirms to media that a pipe has been leaking effluent into a wetland. It’s the same pipeline that broke in 2014. They claim that the leak was small and due to outdated technology.\n- In March, provincial Environment Minister Margaret Miller does not approve new effluent treatment facility, requesting more information on the environmental impact.\n- In May, the federal government commits $100 million to fund a remediation project at Boat Harbour.\n- In October, Northern Pulp’s focus report detailing more information requested by the government is made available to the public.\n- In December, federal Environment and Climate Change Minister Jonathan Wilkinson decides not to give the Northern Pulp project a federal impact assessment, leaving the decision on a new facility to the Nova Scotia government.\n- Later that month, Nova Scotia’s environment minister Gordon Wilson says the government needs more information than the focus report provided, again withholding approval on a new facility. Wilson says scientific evidence of the potential impact is unsatisfactory, and the project will require an environmental assessment report. Northern Pulp has up to two years to submit this report, and after that, the provincial government has up to 285 days to evaluate it and make a decision.\n- Days later, Premier Stephen McNeil announces there will be no extension to the Jan. 31, 2020 closure date set in the Boat Harbour Act. He also announces a $50 million transition fund to aid industry workers affected by the closure.\n- In January, Northern Pulp says it intends to proceed with the environmental impact assessment of its proposed treatment facility. That day, McNeil announces boiler wastewater will continue to flow into Boat Harbour until April 30 in order to heat pipes through the winter to prevent them from freezing and bursting, which could cause more damage.\nHave a story idea?

48	artist rights vs buyer rights creative works	The rights between artists and buyers of creative works are distinctly different. The buyer only owns the physical manifestation of the work and has the right to display it in the same physical location or even destroy it, but cannot make or sell reproductions or create derivative works without permission. This was demonstrated in the Wallace tattoo case where he owned the physical tattoo but couldn't use it in advertisements. Meanwhile, the creator retains all intellectual property rights by default, including reproduction and derivative work rights, unless there's a specific work for hire agreement or copyright transfer in place. Even if the buyer conceived the idea for the work, they don't own the copyright since copyright protects the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves.	['Here is an oldie but goodie from the worlds of sports licensing, which again reminds us that IP assignment agreements are not just for the rarefied world of lab researchers, but for the nitty gritty worlds of tattoo artists and technical foul prone power fowards as well.\nBack when he was playing for the Portland Trail Blazers, basketball star Rasheed Wallace got an elaborate tattoo on his upper right arm depicting an ancient Egyptian royal family with the sun in the background (see photos here and here). For a fee of $450, Portland tattoo artist Matthew Reed created preliminary sketches of the tattoo for Wallace’s approval, then applied ink and needle to skin. Reed and Wallace signed a one page contract, but it was silent on who owned the intellectual property in the tattoo.\nWallace appeared in a Nike television commercial which focused on the tattoo in close up, and included an animation simulating the tattoo’s creation, with voiceover from Wallace explaining the meaning of the symbols.\nReed, surprised that his $450 creation was the focus of a multimillion dollar advertising campaign, sued Wallace, Nike, and its advertising agency for infringement of his copyright.\nA person who creates intellectual property as an independent contractor generally owns that IP, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary. As mentioned, the contract between Reed and Wallace was silent on the issue of copyright ownership, so it could not be considered an assignment of copyright, and the tattoo did not fit one of the work made for hire categories, so it could not be considered a work made for hire. Since Reed was an independent contractor, the ownership of the copyright in the tattoo remained with him. Which meant that anyone who reproduced the tattoo without a license from Reed was infringing his copyright.\nThe lawsuit was settled confidentially, but it is likely that Reed walked away with a lot more than the original $450 fee.\nSo what rights did Wallace get for his $450? Wallace owns the physical manifestation of the tattoo, and has the right to display it to people in the same physical location, but has no right to make or sell reproductions, such as photographs or video, or to create derivative works, such as animations based on the tattoo. Similarly, the purchaser of a painting who does not obtain an assignment of copyright from the painter owns the canvas, and implicitly has the right to sell the original canvas or even destroy it, but does not have the right to make or sell copies of the painting on the canvas.\nAnd it probably would not have helped Wallace’s case even if he proved that he conceived of the “idea” for the tattoo, because copyright does not protect ideas or concepts (e.g. the concept of an Egyptian royal family and a sun), only the expression of those ideas (e.g. an actual image of an Egyptian royal family and a sun).\nTakeaway: when purchasing artwork, video, text, or other creative works that you may wish to make available to a broader audience, make sure that you have a written agreement with the seller/licensor either transferring ownership of the copyright to you, or licensing reproduction rights to you (coupled with a guarantee that he is indeed authorized to license those rights to you). Otherwise, you could get “tattooed” like Rasheed Wallace.', 'What is a Work for Hire Contract?\nA Work for Hire Contract is a legally binding contract between the client (the owner) and the service provider (hired talent) detailing the terms and conditions of the work. It defines the rights and responsibilities between an owner who commissions work and the artist who creates it.\nA Work for Hire Agreement helps ensure that both you and the service provider understand what the project entails and what is to be expected of both parties. This agreement will not only protect your interests as a client, but the interests of the service provider as well. Because it protects both parties, service providers may also use this type of agreement when working with clients.\nWork for hire refers to any work performed by an individual for the benefit of another individual or company. This kind of work product is called intellectual property, something of value that has no tangible form. It is any creative work that’s copyrightable including songs, stories, films, television, and music videos where two parties agree the employer remains the copyright owner. The term “work for hire” came from the copyright law and is a shorthand version of “work made for hire” which was coined in the U.S. Copyright Act of 1976 applied towards work created by an independent contractor or during the course of someone’s job as an employee.\nAs soon as a work is in fixed form (like a book that has been printed or an artistic work that has been completed) the copyright of the work becomes the property of the person who developed it. However, work for hire is an exception to this rule. If a work is made for hire, the owner becomes the employer who hired the person to create the work.\nA Contract Work for Hire is used to ensure that the service provider doesn’t own ownership over the product or the work created. Without a formal agreement in place, rights may not be transferred to the client who purchased the work. For this reason, work for hire agreements are often used when hiring writers and artists for projects.\nIf you are hiring a temporary contractor, you may have concerns over who owns the work you commission. The work for hire doctrine helps clarify this issue.\nGenerally, unless you have a particular written agreement in place before any work begins, anyone who contributes to the project can hypothetically sell the same material to someone else without your permission. This becomes particularly problematic with writing projects. Because under copyright law, authors are presumed to own the copyright to any works they create.\nUnder the work for hire doctrine, work for hire can only exist under two circumstances:\n- Work created by independent contractors. In this case, the work must be specially ordered, which means the service provider must be compensated for creating something new. Prior to creating the work, both parties must enter into a signed and written agreement that the work will be considered a work for hire. The work must also fall under one of the nine statutory categories of commissioned works under the Copyright Act.\n- Work prepared by an employee that is within their scope of employment. Any work created by an employee that is within their scope of employment is considered work for hire.\nMost people are under the assumption that they own the rights to any work they have paid for. Without a written work for hire agreement in place, you may not necessarily own the rights to the work. In the absence of a work for hire contract, there may be confusion about how each party can use the work that was created. This confusion can create significant legal and financial problems for both parties. Therefore, it is important to enter a valid and enforceable work for hire agreement prior to commissioning or specially ordering work to be performed on your behalf.\nFor service providers, signing a work for hire agreement with your client will put their minds at ease and assure them that they own the work they have paid for.\nA Work for Hire Contract Template should include the following:\n- A timeline for the project\n- A detailed work schedule\n- Project milestones\n- Terms of payment\nHow to fill out a Work for Hire Contract?\nUsing PDFRun, you can electronically fill out and download a PDF copy of a Work for Hire Contract PDF in minutes. Fill it out by following the instructions below.\nEnter the date when the agreement was made, following the format: Month, Day, Year.\nEnter the client’s full name.\nEnter the service provider’s full name.\nTerms and Conditions\nEnter the type of services the service provider will provide to the client.\nEnter the date the requested services must be delivered to the client, following the format: Month, Day, Year.\nBy filling in this part, the service provider agrees to provide the services in a competent and workmanlike fashion in accordance with applicable standards of the profession.

49	What happens to proteins that fail quality checks?	Proteins that are unfit during quality checks in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen are broken down into their components and stored in the lumen until they can be recycled.	"[""The endoplasmic reticulum is found almost all eukaryotic cells. It comprises two distinct components: rough endoplasmic reticulum (rough ER or RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (smooth ER or SER).\nThe two types of endoplasmic reticulum have different structures, but they are two parts of the same organelle. They have distinct functions but also work together to process and distribute molecules to other organelles within the cell and to export molecules outside the cell.\nTL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)\nThe two types of endoplasmic reticulum in cells are rough ER and smooth ER. They have separate functions but work together to process protein molecules in the cell.\nEndoplasmic Reticulum Structure\nRough endoplasmic reticulum is made of a long, folded membrane that forms a series of narrow pockets. The pockets run parallel to each other and are formed from one continuous membrane. The space between the rows of pockets is called the lumen.\nThe “rough” texture of rough ER comes from the ribosomes attached to its folds, giving the membrane a nubby surface.\nSmooth endoplasmic reticulum consists of a set of interconnecting narrow tubes that are connected to the outer fold of the rough ER. The tubes are open at one end. The network of the smooth ER takes up less volume in the cell than the rough ER. As its name implies, it has a smooth surface because it is not covered in ribosomes.\nRole in Protein Synthesis and Processing\nProtein synthesis occurs in the ribosomes attached to the rough ER. Messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules in the nucleus contain the code for making proteins. The membrane of the rough ER is connected to the nuclear membrane and acts as a conduit for mRNA between the nucleus and the ribosomes.\nThe main rough ER functions are to process the newly synthesized proteins and package them so they can be carried in vesicles to other organelles or transported to the cell membrane where they will be excreted outside the cell. Many of the proteins are conveyed in vesicles produced by the smooth ER.\nProteins must be folded to be used effectively by the organelles. Before they are transported out of the ER, proteins receive a quality check in the lumen. Unfit molecules are broken down into their components and stored in the lumen until they can be recycled.\nFat Synthesis, Metabolism and Detoxification\nThe chief function of smooth ER is the production of lipids aka fats. Two types of fat molecules made in the smooth ER are steroids and phospholipids. Steroids are made in the cells of the adrenal and endocrine glands.\nSmooth endoplasmic reticulum has varied roles depending on the type of cells it is found in. In brain and muscle cells, it plays a role in carbohydrate metabolism. Calcium ions necessary for muscle contraction are released from the smooth ER in muscle cells.\nIn liver cells, it aids in processing toxins such as poisonous substances and drugs by breaking down the chemicals into water-soluble molecules. The smooth ER can expand to temporarily increase its surface area when necessary to process large loads of toxins more efficiently.\nThe Golgi complex, or Golgi apparatus, is another cell organelle that works in conjunction with the ER and ribosomes in the production of proteins. It is often located in proximity to the endoplasmic reticulum, which allows molecules to be transported easily between the two organelles.\nAfter the endoplasmic reticulum processes and packages proteins, the molecules move to the Golgi complex for finalization where they are further modified to be ready for use within or outside the cell.\nAbout the Author\nA.P.

50	I'm researching urban art scenes globally, and I'd like to compare the support systems for street artists in Tel Aviv versus Los Angeles - how do the institutional attitudes towards street art differ between these cities?	In Tel Aviv, according to artist Nitzan Mintz, street artists work without institutional support, as 'the municipality does not support us' and artists have 'no money coming from anyone,' making it a grassroots movement 'still from the heart.' In contrast, Los Angeles shows a more complex institutional relationship with street art, where there's significant spending on control - as Stecyk notes, the country spends over $5 billion yearly on graffiti abatement and prevention, while questioning 'What's the difference between the Sistine Chapel and the side of an underpass? Not much. So why do we criminalize beauty?'	"['If you happen to be walking down the street and you notice a funny little character giving you the finger, it might just be one of Adi Sened’s box people, the kufsonim. Sened’s box people can be found in countless places all over the city. Adi Sened was born in Israel and had been painting since he was a child. While studying architecture at Bezalel and learning to use more complex techniques that enhanced his ability to express himself, his passion for art erupted and he began to pursue art as a career. Sened is a one of the pioneers of the street art movement, as he has been painting his kufsonim all over the city since 2000. He began putting his art on the street without thinking. He says that he just created a cool character, put it on some wood-cuts, and decided to post them in public places. He says, “It’s like the best gallery in town.” His advice to you is to “have fun in the open space because you can be intimate in a crowded space.”\nIn the presence of Know Hope’s public work, you become a part of the art itself. His use of imagery and symbolism in his pieces causes an interference with its context and the dialogue that is created by this interaction is the art. Hope was born in California and moved to Tel Aviv when he was ten. His parents are artists, and while he never formally studied art he was always making and creating art in different capacities and methods. In 2004, he began putting his art in public places and it changed his cognitive perception of the creative process in terms of what kind of dialogue could be created through art. Know Hope’s work is based on translating his own observations of human interactions that he sees in everyday life into a universal representation. “I think that the only difference between an artist and somebody that doesn’t make art is that the artist consciously interferes and creates these situations, whereas people that aren’t artists are as much a part of it, just it’s not necessarily on such a conscious level.”\nSignor Gi’s art focuses on the theme of understanding identity within a dynamic social-historical perspective. His pieces enlighten you to the irony that is created when there exists a dichotomy between your inner-self and the self that you present to the world. Signor Gis is from Milan, where he studied history and philosophy. There, he started doing street art by painting over advertisements things like moustaches and glasses. He didn’t really think it was art, but did it more to rebel against the way that advertising imposes a societal pressure to live up to certain lifestyles. After moving to Israel, he studied graphic design and visual communication at Bezalel. His studies encouraged him to take on art as a career and helped him develop a style that includes unique typography and graphics. If you want to get to know more about street art in Tel Aviv, he recommends you to “just walk around the streets, especially South Tel Aviv, Florentin, but not only Florentin, but south Florentin, Kiryat Melcha…that’s an area where a lot of street street-artists paint or practice their style.”\nWhen your mind begins to wander towards the problems of life don’t fear because Dede has a band-aid for you. He originally began experimenting with the symbol as a way to express and heal his wounds. The band-aid then became a symbol for all kinds of difficulties – personal and social – seeking remedies. Dede was born in Israel and began creating art at very young age. He carried that passion onto the street about ten years ago. Due to his longevity in the public art scene, you can see many variations of his style sprinkled all over Tel Aviv. Sometimes you will find variations of his bird stencils, and more recently you would be likely to find much larger pieces of two-headed animals. If you see the band-aid, you can be sure that Dede had something to do with the piece’s creation. His latest work included a redesign of the iconic Dolphinarium on the Tel Aviv beachfront to include a set of teeth.\nIf from the shadows of some alleyway appears a poem that reaches out and delivers you a message, the message likely came from Nitzan Mintz. Nitzan was born in Tel Aviv and while she was in the army and she began writing poetry. She wanted to get her messages out, but was unsure how to go about publishing her work. In the publishing world, you need to be connected, and because she didn’t know how to access the relevant people, she started putting her art onto wooden boards and nailing them to electrical posts. Her work approaches a wide range of topics because, Nitzan says, she has “a million things to say, so every time it’s a different thing. Sometimes its like selfish poetry, sometimes its political poetry, sometimes its more philosophical.” Nitzan’s poems usually have a deep connection with the locations she chooses. Today Nitzan is a student of art and writing at Minshar. She has yet to formally publish her work in a book but continues to broadcast her message on the Tel Aviv’s streets. “People here in the street art scene work hard. They don’t have any money coming from anyone. The municipality does not support us. It’s still fresh. It’s still kicking. People really take their paint and do what they want so it is still from really from the heart, really artistic, and smart.”', 'PUNK PUSH: Craig Stecyk helped set the tone for the surfer and skater aesthetics… (Liz O. Baylen / Los Angeles…)\nAhead of MOCA\'s sweeping ""Art in the Streets"" exhibition, opening April 17 at the Geffen Contemporary, The Times interviewed three street art pioneers from the show: Chaz Bojórquez, Craig Stecyk and Risk. A Q&A with Stecyk follows below; read the rest of the story here and here.\nCraig Stecyk helped define the surf-skate-punk-graffiti aesthetic of Venice and Santa Monica in the 1970s by publishing his photographs of Dogtown and Z-Boys skaters in various magazines. (He also co-wrote the 2001 documentary with Stacy Peralta.) The Geffen will have his posters and sculptures, with a monitor showing archival images.\nHis first skateboard\nWhen I was 12 or 13 I made my own skateboards by finding oak drawer fronts — I\'d ride around to forage, very much like I still do. And if you went overboard, you would take the wheels from Union ball-bearing steel roller skates. I stole my cousin\'s skates, and she\'s still angry about it.\nThe role of the 10 Freeway\nWhen the Santa Monica Freeway was built, they condemned a bunch of houses with eminent domain. It created a rift down the spine of Los Angeles, suddenly a whole block through the city — gone. But if you were a roving kid, this was free material and no supervision: garages full of paint, houses full of furniture. We\'d take parts from cars to make ad-hoc sculptures. I should have been taking pictures then.\nI was always around cameras. My dad was an early documenter of Hiroshima during World War II, though he would never talk about the nature of that assignment. I started shooting surfers in 1962 or \'63 — I was interested in documenting what I was seeing, and magazines weren\'t doing it yet. The skate shots came later — just like there was demand for Miki Dora in surfing magazines, there was soon demand for Tony Alva. But I shot everything for no particular reason, which is what I still do today.\nStreet art that inspires him\nStreet art is the original form of art, if you go back to Lascaux [cave paintings] or look around this town. I think the first great painting in L.A. is by [David Alfaro] Siqueiros on Olvera Street: ""Tropical America"" [now under restoration.] It\'s a piece that rivals ""Guernica,"" an incredibly significant piece that was censored almost immediately.\nIn this country we spend over $5 billion a year on graffiti abatement and prevention. It\'s strange to me. What\'s the difference between the Sistine Chapel and the side of an underpass? Not much. So why do we criminalize beauty?\nI still make these posters — some are etchings, some are hand-painted. I mount them on telephone poles, wherever I am. I\'ve done them in Indonesia, Japan, Brazil, Africa, all over. I like to make incidental images — things that you don\'t even realize you\'ve seen.\nWhere to see his work on the streets today\nThere might be a couple posters in Ludlow, Calif., outside Route 66. Though I don\'t know if they are still there. Put them up and they disappear in 60 minutes, even in places where you don\'t see a single person all day.\nProfile: Street artist Chaz Bojórquez\nProfile: Street artist Risk']"	['<urn:uuid:c6d4f091-d532-4481-a96e-4ff3664ad956>', '<urn:uuid:6d47a4d0-1ed4-4117-9c4c-a6ea5c7846af>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	36	96	1489
51	What causes leukemia, and how long does radiation treatment take?	Leukemia develops from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including genetic disorders, chemical exposure, smoking, and previous cancer treatments. For radiation treatment, external therapy typically lasts 5 days a week for 5 weeks, while internal radiation can take 48-72 hours for low-dose or a few hours for high-dose therapy.	"[""Leukemia is cancer of the body's blood-forming tissues, including the bone marrow and the lymphatic system.\nMany types of leukemia exist. Some forms of leukemia are more common in children. Other forms of leukemia occur mostly in adults.\nLeukemia usually involves the white blood cells. Your white blood cells are potent infection fighters — they normally grow and divide in an orderly way, as your body needs them. But in people with leukemia, the bone marrow produces an excessive amount of abnormal white blood cells, which don't function properly.\nTreatment for leukemia can be complex — depending on the type of leukemia and other factors. But there are strategies and resources that can help make your treatment successful.\nProducts & Services\nLeukemia symptoms vary, depending on the type of leukemia. Common leukemia signs and symptoms include:\n- Fever or chills\n- Persistent fatigue, weakness\n- Frequent or severe infections\n- Losing weight without trying\n- Swollen lymph nodes, enlarged liver or spleen\n- Easy bleeding or bruising\n- Recurrent nosebleeds\n- Tiny red spots in your skin (petechiae)\n- Excessive sweating, especially at night\n- Bone pain or tenderness\nWhen to see a doctor\nMake an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs or symptoms that worry you.\nLeukemia symptoms are often vague and not specific. You may overlook early leukemia symptoms because they may resemble symptoms of the flu and other common illnesses.\nSometimes leukemia is discovered during blood tests for some other condition.\nYour body's lymphatic system is part of your immune system, which protects you against infection and disease. The lymphatic system includes your spleen, thymus, lymph nodes and lymph channels, as well as your tonsils and adenoids.\nScientists don't understand the exact causes of leukemia. It seems to develop from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\nHow leukemia forms\nIn general, leukemia is thought to occur when some blood cells acquire changes (mutations) in their genetic material or DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. Normally, the DNA tells the cell to grow at a set rate and to die at a set time. In leukemia, the mutations tell the blood cells to continue growing and dividing.\nWhen this happens, blood cell production becomes out of control. Over time, these abnormal cells can crowd out healthy blood cells in the bone marrow, leading to fewer healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets, causing the signs and symptoms of leukemia.\nHow leukemia is classified\nDoctors classify leukemia based on its speed of progression and the type of cells involved.\nThe first type of classification is by how fast the leukemia progresses:\n- Acute leukemia. In acute leukemia, the abnormal blood cells are immature blood cells (blasts). They can't carry out their normal functions, and they multiply rapidly, so the disease worsens quickly. Acute leukemia requires aggressive, timely treatment.\n- Chronic leukemia. There are many types of chronic leukemias. Some produce too many cells and some cause too few cells to be produced. Chronic leukemia involves more-mature blood cells. These blood cells replicate or accumulate more slowly and can function normally for a period of time. Some forms of chronic leukemia initially produce no early symptoms and can go unnoticed or undiagnosed for years.\nThe second type of classification is by type of white blood cell affected:\n- Lymphocytic leukemia. This type of leukemia affects the lymphoid cells (lymphocytes), which form lymphoid or lymphatic tissue. Lymphatic tissue makes up your immune system.\n- Myelogenous (my-uh-LOHJ-uh-nus) leukemia. This type of leukemia affects the myeloid cells. Myeloid cells give rise to red blood cells, white blood cells and platelet-producing cells.\nTypes of leukemia\nThe major types of leukemia are:\n- Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). This is the most common type of leukemia in young children. ALL can also occur in adults.\n- Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). AML is a common type of leukemia. It occurs in children and adults. AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults.\n- Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). With CLL, the most common chronic adult leukemia, you may feel well for years without needing treatment.\n- Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). This type of leukemia mainly affects adults. A person with CML may have few or no symptoms for months or years before entering a phase in which the leukemia cells grow more quickly.\n- Other types. Other, rarer types of leukemia exist, including hairy cell leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative disorders.\nFactors that may increase your risk of developing some types of leukemia include:\n- Previous cancer treatment. People who've had certain types of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for other cancers have an increased risk of developing certain types of leukemia.\n- Genetic disorders. Genetic abnormalities seem to play a role in the development of leukemia. Certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, are associated with an increased risk of leukemia.\n- Exposure to certain chemicals. Exposure to certain chemicals, such as benzene — which is found in gasoline and is used by the chemical industry — is linked to an increased risk of some kinds of leukemia.\n- Smoking. Smoking cigarettes increases the risk of acute myelogenous leukemia.\n- Family history of leukemia. If members of your family have been diagnosed with leukemia, your risk of the disease may be increased.\nHowever, most people with known risk factors don't get leukemia. And many people with leukemia have none of these risk factors.\nJan. 13, 2021"", ""Serving all people by providing personalized health and wellness through exemplary care, education and research.\nExplore health content from A to Z.\nI need information about...\nRadiation therapy is a treatment for cancer that uses rays of energy. A machine directs the rays of energy to the area of cancer. Radiation therapy is also called radiotherapy. Its goal is to kill or shrink cancer cells.\nTypes of radiation therapy\nThere are two main types of radiation therapy:\nExternal radiation. The radiation comes from a machine and is pointed at the skin over the tumor.\nInternal radiation (brachytherapy). This is the most common type of radiation therapy for endometrial cancer. It is usually done after surgery. Radioactive material is placed inside the vagina, near the tumor. This therapy can help lower the risk of the cancer returning with fewer risks than external beam radiation to the whole pelvis.\nIn many cases, both external and internal radiation are used together to treat vaginal cancer.\nYou will talk with a radiation oncologist. This is a doctor who specializes in both cancer and radiation. You’ll work with your doctor to decide what your treatment will be and how long it will last. During your visit, ask what you can expect to feel during and after the treatment.\nThis type of radiation therapy is also called brachytherapy. Low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy is done in the hospital over a period of 48 to 72 hours. High-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy is done over a few hours and you can go home that day. There are two types of internal radiation therapy:\nIntracavitary radiation. This uses radioactive material that is inside a cylindrical container or tube that is put in the vagina.\nInterstitial radiation. This uses needles that contain radioactive material and are placed directly into the tumor and nearby tissues.\nDuring internal radiation:\nYou may have tests ahead of time to see where the radioactive material should be placed. Then, the oncologist places radioactive material inside your vagina.\nThe material stays in place for a period of time to kill the abnormal cells. How long it stays in place varies. This depends on the stage and location of your cancer.\nThe doctor removes the radioactive material before you go home.\nRadiation does not stay in your body after the treatment is done. You are not radioactive, so you do not pose a risk to those around you. But during treatment, your doctor may want you to remain a certain distance from visitors and pregnant women and children. Talk with your healthcare provider about these safety steps before your treatment.\nExternal radiation therapy is done in a hospital or a clinic. You go home that day. The standard treatment lasts 5 days a week for 5 weeks. This type of radiation may come from a machine called a linear accelerator.\nBefore your first treatment, you will have a session to find exactly where on your body the radiation beam needs to be directed. The process is called simulation. This session may take up to 2 hours. You’ll lie still on a table while a radiation therapist uses a machine to define your treatment field. The field is the exact area on your body where the radiation will be aimed. You may have more than one treatment field if you have cancer in more than one place. The therapist marks your skin with tiny dots of colored permanent ink so that the radiation will be aimed at the exact same place each time.\nYou may also have imaging scans, such as computed tomography (CT) scans. These are to help doctors know the exact location of your tumor to better aim the radiation. Also at this session, you may have body molds made to help keep you from moving during the treatment.\nDuring the treatment sessions:\nThe experience is like getting an X-ray. It takes about 15 minutes to complete. You should plan on being there for about an hour.\nYou’ll lie on a table while the machine is placed over you. You may have to wear a hospital gown.\nYou may see lights from the machine lined up with the marks on your skin. These help the therapist know you are in the right position. The machine will not touch you.\nWhen you are in the right position, the therapist will leave the room and turn the machine on. You may hear whirring or clicking noises while the radiation is being given. When the machine sends radiation to your tumor, you will need to be very still. You do not have to hold your breath. You can’t feel radiation, so the process will be painless.\nDuring the session, you will be able to talk to the therapist over an intercom.\nYou will not be radioactive afterward.\nTalk to your doctor about what you might feel like during and after radiation therapy. All cancer treatments have side effects. Side effects often get worse as treatment goes on, but can be treated. Side effects often get better or go away over time after treatment ends. The side effects of radiation therapy include:\nSkin in the treated area that is irritated, dry, red, and blistered like a sunburn, including inside your vagina\nHair loss in the area being treated\nFeeling tired or weak\nNausea or diarrhea\nSide effects depend on the part of your body that's being treated. Talk to your doctor about what side effects you can expect and what can be done to prevent or ease them. Ask your doctor what symptoms to watch out for. In some cases, you should call your healthcare team. Your doctor may want you to call if you have signs of infection, such as fever or pain that gets worse.\nSome long-term side effects of radiation may not show up for many years after you finish treatment. These depend on the dose and location of the radiation. These also depend on how many times you had the treatment. Ask your doctor what you may expect.\nCopyright © 2016 Baylor Scott & White Health.

52	interested in social benefits in bhutan what does government provide citizens free	In Bhutan, the government provides free education and free healthcare to its citizens, along with infrastructure development, as part of their development policies.	['Ambassador Wangdi, I was in Bhutan two weeks ago. It was beautiful. And of course I asked everybody, ‘What is happiness?’, because Bhutan has told the whole world that the measurement of success is not only GNP, or GDP but also GNH, Gross National Happiness. How would you define happiness for the Bhutan people?\nWell, I would start by quoting His Majesty the King of Bhutan, the fifth King. He very succinctly captured it all by saying that it’s the development of human values. To expound a little, it means it is sustainability-based, wellbeing-centric and inclusive economic growth, where we don’t reject economic development. But at the same time, there are other intangibles that need to be looked into, including good-governance promotion and the enhancement of culture and conservation of nature. So there’s a holistic approach.\nSo it doesn’t reject the economic model but adds to it. In fact the economic aspect is our basic means to achieving the ultimate objective, which is that of happiness. So in a sense, [it is] an equilibrium, balancing the needs of the body with that of mind, in a secure and stable environment. And the objective of the government is, through public policy, to create an enabling environment for the pursuit of happiness. This is in essence what we believe.\nIs it working?\nVery good question. Many people have certain misconceptions about what this is all about. First, we don’t claim at this moment to have achieved happiness. What is different is that in Bhutan we are serious about the pursuit of happiness. So have we achieved it? Not yet. But we’re serious about it and [are] approaching it holistically. [Another] misconception is that this is about happiness on its own. Happiness cannot happen in isolation or in a bubble. In fact it is goes with Buddhist philosophy that everything is interdependent, especially in a globalised world. It’s much more relevant that happiness has to be inclusive and global, because it impacts one another: climate change, economic upheaval, security, peace – it’s all interdependent.\nThere’s a strong recognition that development has to be holistic.\nBut you also face a challenge of modern-day capitalism, global warming, poverty – and all these could threaten your goal of happiness.\nBecause there are such emerging new challenges [like] climate change, for example, and poverty, especially abject poverty, GNH or the concept of GNH is more relevant. It should be more holistic because of the interdependence of everything. I think the challenge lies in how we can implement GNH according to one’s own situation. This is not “one-size-fits-all”.\nSo for the average citizen of Bhutan, how would you explain the Bhutan model? What would be described as success for GNH on a day-to-day basis? What kind of quality of life would they have if they were today to say “this is GNH and it is working for me personally”?\nVarious aspects. For example, we all know that Bhutan is a very old country, but in the modern context we only have about 100 years of being under the present dynasty. Development started only, say, less than 50 years ago. We had many things intact – culture, environment, social stability – [but] our development infrastructures were behind. And then the third king [of the current House of Wangchuk] started the process of modern development, building on the socio-economic development, foundation of democracy. And the fourth king completely devolved power to the people. And the fifth king is nurturing democracy.\nNow the question is, is this working? On many fronts it is working, as people are content. We have poverty. It is a reality, but not in terms of abject poverty. There are social inequities, but inequities that are modern in nature because of economic growth. How I say it is working in Bhutan for average people is [in terms of] access to health, education, infrastructure. All these are tremendous changes from [the situation over] the past 40 years.\nSo, free education, free healthcare?\nYes, free education, free healthcare, infrastructures … and we’ve made huge progress following that concept. And in GNH we talk about interdependence and so one of our priorities is having friendly relations with all countries, all entities, particularly all our neighbours. We expanded diplomatic relations with Thailand, for example. We have tremendous goodwill. Cooperation is growing. So these are evidence of GNH working.\nAs part of our GNH environmental policy, our forest has increased from about 60 per cent to almost 80 per cent. More than half the country is now declared a [national] park.\nWill you see more Thai investors in Bhutan, especially in hospitality services?\nWe hope to see, especially investors from Thailand, take interest in investing in Bhutan, especially in the hospitality and tourism sector, because Thailand has a rich tradition [there]. Given your own innate culture of hospitality and courtesy, you have advanced experience and knowledge about this.\nOpportunities are there and the government has a very liberal, very welcoming foreign direct investment policy.']	['<urn:uuid:f72fe182-49ad-4149-a9d3-7967dd307c00>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	12	23	832
53	hardwood installation professional seeking nailed glued down method differences problems avoid	Direct glue installation requires applying flooring adhesive to the subfloor and is the most stable method as the elastic adhesive allows for expansion. For nailed installations, use a Porta Nailer to drive nails at 30 degrees through the tongue into the subfloor, but this cannot be done on chipboard floors as they're too weak to hold nails. To prevent problems, a glue assist method is highly recommended with any nail-down application for floors that are thin, wide, or in environments with humidity swings.	['It’s the moment we’ve been waiting for since that first triple digit day – fall! That glorious time when there’s a nip in the air, we pull out the jackets, keep the coffee pot running, and use inordinate amounts of nutmeg and cloves in our treats. And.. sometimes begin to hear a squeaky wood floor in our homes.\nAs temperatures start to cool, humidity levels outside and inside also shift from balmy to dry. When you turn on the heater, even more air moisture is lost and if not replaced, your floors can start to tell you about it in a very audible fashion.\nSo, grab your pumpkin spice latte and find out what your floors are telling you when they start squeaking.\n1: Something is Moving\nThe easiest fix for a squeaky wood floor is to stop walking on it. That isn’t realistic but it indicates the root problem with this issue is there is movement somewhere. Once you figure out where the movement is coming from, you will be able to quiet down your floors again. Find out why your floor is moving here.\n2: I Need Some Attention\nSqueaks and creaks are a normal part of having hardwood flooring. But when you notice that squeaky wood floor, take a few moments to listen to what your floor is saying.\nAlways know your home’s RH levels. Hygrometers are an easy tool to use for keeping track and knowing when humidity levels start to drop. Gaps can be another indicator of decreased RH levels.\n3: The Weather Has Changed\nIf you are noticing noisy wood floors during the extreme points in summer or winter, then the movement is related to the environment. In the dead of winter, floors will naturally be drier – your home can be drier than the Sahara at times.\nAnd dry air = shrinking and gaps.\nOnce the weather shifts, it should resolve. The inverse is true for summer when wood swells. To keep this from being problematic, you should have a humidifier to add moisture back into the air and maintain the 35-55% RH that your floor needs to be happy.\nA squeaky wood floor is a good reminder to turn on your humidifier and do any necessary maintenance to the unit. Don’t have a humidifier? Learn more about humidifiers here.\n4: My Board-to-Board Noise is Annoying\nThis happens when two boards are loose enough to rub together in the tongue and groove. This type of squeak is localized to one area or to only two boards perhaps a result of insufficient fasteners. You may also observe individual board movement with this type of squeak.\n5: The Subfloor is a Problem\nIf you can take a step away from one squeaky area to another, your problem may be with the subfloor. These squeaks will cover a larger area than just two boards and if you were to see movement, it will be over a larger section of the floor. Dig a little deeper and read this on noisy floors.\nSeasonal Change Not the Problem?\nIf you have a squeaky wood floor that lasts beyond seasonal changes, it may be time to look into what other issues might be happening by calling a flooring professional.\nWe would be happy to answer any questions you have about your floor as well. Find the nearest RW Supply+Design location here.\nPlease Fix My Squeaky Wood Floor!\nIf your squeaky wood floor is driving you crazy, you may be able to fix them with these solutions:\n- Screws from underneath to seat the flooring to the subfloor in problem areas.\n- Hollow spot repair: drilling a hole in the flooring and filling the void with epoxy is a possible solution: http://www.dritac.com/productsRS.php\n- Squeak No More: http://www.oberry-enterprises.com this method will allow for top screwing boards, but counter sinking the screws.\n- Squeak Ender: http://www.squeakender.com this cures the issue of voids between subfloor and flooring joists. (Shimming the voids can also help here, but might cause squeaks in other areas)\n- Lubricants: This may sound a little hokey, but talcum powder (*no longer recommended due to adverse health affects), graphite, and WD-40 are all solutions that have helped squeaking floors. This is usually somewhat temporary. One NWFA certified inspector swears by WD-40 as a solution. In these cases, the movement is causing friction between the flooring boards. When this is the case, lubricating the friction points will eliminate the sound. *Always consult your flooring manufacturer before using non-standard fixes as there could be warranty implications.\nThe Best Way to Stop Squeaks…\nPrevent them before they start. We highly recommend using a glue assist method with any nail-down application for floors that are thin, wide, or being installed in an environment with swings in humidity.\nGet all the details and learn 2 glue assist methods in the video below:', 'Expansion & Contraction of Hardwood Floors\n“The flooring shop stated to depart 10mm for wood floor expansion in the walls…the boards are lifting started.” Ill informed advice such as this frequently results in floor problems. Many flooring sales agents not really acquainted with wood flooring assume expansion is equivalent to laminate floors. The truth is that 10mm isn’t enough for wood flooring.\nWhat’s An Expansion Area? So Why Do We Want It?\nExpansion areas are spaces left round the perimeter of rooms, against fixed objects for example posts, thresholds, hearths, skirting boards, along with other stationary products built or guaranteed in to the framing structure of the house. Despite the fact that Hardwood floors used is not living and breathing still it reacts to moisture alterations in the atmosphere. Cells within the wood will require on or absorb moisture once the relative humidity is high, or when uncovered to water. Expansion happens, and also the hardwood grows, for insufficient a clearer term, over the grain (width) from the plank (see below, not every will react by doing this). On the other hand when air moisture levels decrease, moisture content evaporates, shrinking from the wood will occur.\nWhenever we say spaces, they’re understood to be installing the hardwood floors as much as and from the fixed objects. For instance “we advise a minimum of 15mm promising small to medium area-18mm expansion on bigger areas in the skirting board or wall if new skirting to become fitted.”\nHardwood floors can respond to the existence of moisture. Within the dry winter heating several weeks, moisture can leave the wooden flooring resulting in the floor to contract slightly in dimensions, which could leave slight gaps in between each floor board. Within the summer time several weeks once the humidity is greater, the hardwood floors will expand and also the gaps will appear reduced. If there’s an excessive amount of moisture within the subfloor it’ll make the wood planks to cup, or buckle. Almost all problems associated with hardwood floors result from improper installation and sub floor preparation. For this reason it’s important when installing hardwood floors that you simply stick to the correct suggested installation methods through the manufacturer.\nDirect Glue Installations\nAn immediate glue installation requires using a flooring adhesive applied directly to the subfloor (never directly affect it’s). This process may be used on concrete and wooden subfloors. When done properly this is actually the most stable way of fitting wood flooring because the elastic flooring adhesive enables the ground to grow and hire no problems.\nIf you’re lounging more than a concrete subfloor you’ll first need checked the concrete moisture, when the floor includes a moisture content well over 4% then either hold back until the sub floor dries to satisfy this level or make use of an appropriate moisture barrier, we advise Sika Mb Primer to make sure no moist increases up to your new floor.\nAlso observe that new concrete slabs require no less than two months drying time before covering all of them with a wood floor.\nAll Concrete sub-floors should be dry, smooth, level and free from structural defects. When the concrete sub floor is uneven we advise using sika latex self leveling compound to level the subfloor. The concrete should also be free from contaminants i.e. paint, oil, wax grease, dirt and curing compounds (the reason behind this is you require the self leveling compound to bond towards the sub floor).These could be removed chemically or robotically as the local home improvement store and they’ll sell the correct floor cleaner, but don’t use solvent-based strippers under any conditions. Using residual solvents can make issues with the connecting of flooring glues. You should ensure an effective bond between your glues and concrete and wood panels.\nFor those who have a wood subfloor you will have to lay a plywood base within the existing floor boards (we advise using 4mm -6mm exterior grade plywood and screw lower every 15cm across the edges and also at 20cm times throughout all of those other board while using 1 ” deck screws) before installation, this can then provide you with a smooth and level surface that you should install you hardwood floors onto.\nYou will have to leave a 15mm expansion gap round the perimeter from the room for big areas over 6 meters long we advise 18mm expansion gap. To keep this gap during installation spacers are supplied within the kits. Once you have installed the hardwood floor you are able to cover this expansion gap with scotia or new skirting boards The 15mm expansion gap must also remain in doorways in which the hardwood floor follows through in one room to a different we sell on this web site a complete selection of door profiles available to fit your floor.\nNailed Lower Installations\nNailed lower installation may be the traditional method to install hardwood flooring and could be done either directly onto wooden subfloor or on the concrete subfloor by using battens. When fixing battens onto concrete you may need a power-actuated nailer they are driving with the battens and connect into the concrete, first of all construct polyethylene moisture sheet then plywood within the battens to produce a new sub floor. We advise 12mm exterior grade plywood and 2inch x 4inch battens. Lay battens around perimeter at ½ inch in the wall, leave ¼ inch gap each and every finish. Squeeze first batten so its center is 16 inches in the outdoors fringe of the perimeter batten. Construct the rest of the battens over the area 16 inch times. Check you battens are level using an amount gauge you may want to use cedar plank shims to even out dips within the concrete, slide the shims underneath the battens until level. (If uncertain we advise talking to an expert fitter with this method).\nHardwood flooring could be nailed into existing wooden subfloors for example floorboards or plywood although not into chipboard floors as these aren’t sufficiently strong to carry their nails. The floorboards should be in good shape and level otherwise you should lay 6mm exterior grade plywood lower first.\nTo prevent creaking, check within the subfloor and safely fasten any loose floorboards. For additional soundproofing it’s also advisable to utilize a standard foam underlay.\nWhenever you nail lower a good wood floor you utilize a Porta Nailer they are driving a nail in a 30 degree position with the tongue and in to the subfloor. Porta Nailers could be hired from the good hire shop but they are costly to purchase.\nAgain you will have to leave a 15mm expansion gap round the perimeter from the room. To keep this gap during installation spacers are supplied within the installation kits.']	['<urn:uuid:d1881474-658a-4de4-b319-f265ac2354b0>', '<urn:uuid:baaf2937-e227-490c-a71e-fb7131d26644>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	11	83	1930
54	What are the business benefits and environmental impacts of mining?	Mining operations can bring significant business value, as demonstrated by projects like Filo del Sol which discovered high-grade copper, gold and silver deposits with expanding potential of 1.2-1.6 billion tonnes. However, mining causes severe environmental damage including removal of vegetation, loss of biodiversity, disruption of water systems, and permanent ecosystem destruction. The process creates noise, dust, and pollution affecting nearby communities and wildlife. Specifically for aggregate mining, it can impair water quality, harm aquifers, fragment natural habitats, and threaten endangered species like the Jefferson Salamander.	['Filo Mining Corp. (TSX-V: FIL) (Nasdaq First North Growth Market: FIL) (OTCQX: FLMMF) is pleased to announce the discovery of a significant new zone of high-grade copper, gold and silver mineralization at the Filo del Sol project in San Juan province, Argentina.\nHighlights are listed below, along with accompanying figures:\nCommenting on the results, President and CEO Jamie Beck said “Hole 41 is a game-changer for the project and by far the best hole ever drilled at Filo del Sol. We believe it will rank as one of the best holes drilled globally this year. It represents the first intersection of the long-sought feeder zone for the high-sulphidation mineralization at Filo. These results reset our expectations of what is possible at Filo. Our drilling over the past three years has confirmed the vast size potential of this deposit and with hole 41 we have demonstrated this system can also produce exceptional grades. This results in a compelling combination of values and provides us with the evidence we need to justify expanding our exploration efforts. We remain convinced that Filo del Sol will turn out to be one of the most important copper-gold-silver discoveries in recent years and we see strong potential for additional high-grade zones as we drill out the deposit. We look forward to sharing exploration results from our remaining holes, culminating in a resource update by year end. Planning has already begun for our next field campaign, and following a short break, we anticipate continuous, year-round activities leading to our most ambitious field program ever.”\nA total of nine holes have now been completed during the current program, with five in progress. Assay results for seven of the holes have been released, with the remainder to come. The program has been successful in expanding the deposit by 1 kilometre to the north, 250m to the east, and it remains open in both these directions as well as at depth.\n|HOLE-ID||From (m)||To (m)||Length (m)||Cu %||Au g/t||Ag g/t||CuEq %|\nHole FSDH037 was started during the past season at an angle of -70 degrees towards the west and was curtailed as that program ended due to the pandemic. The hole was deepened this season to a final depth of 882m where it was stopped due to drilling problems. The hole ended in strong mineralization, with the last 20m averaging 0.84% CuEq (0.68% Cu; 0.20g/t Au; 2.3g/t Ag). This hole is 400m north of FSDH041 and bottoms 360m south of FSDH043. Similar to FSDH043, copper values increased towards the bottom of the hole. Mineralization in this hole is visually subtle and is contained in a very homogeneous section of rhyolite which contains disseminated sulphides and is cut by a weak stockwork of quartz veinlets.\nHole FSDH041 was collared 200m north of FSDH032 and drilled at an angle of -75 degrees towards the west to a final depth of 1,046m. The hole was abandoned due to drilling difficulties, but ended in strong mineralization, with the final 20m averaging 1.20% CuEq (0.65% Cu; 0.72g/t Au; 2.3g/t Ag). The hole was planned to test the northern extension to the strong mineralization encountered in FSDH032 and was drilled below an historical reverse circulation hole (VRC071) which was 406m long and intersected 20m at 1.51% CuEq (1.10%Cu; 0.63g/t Au; 1.1g/t Ag) towards the bottom.\nFSDH041 intersected various hydrothermal breccias between 360 and 502m, followed by a strongly altered rhyolite, which is cut by several porphyry intervals towards the bottom of the hole. This rhyolite is overprinted, starting at a depth of 780m, by an intense residual silica alteration with abundant sulphides, which is interpreted to be a feeder structure and contains very high copper, gold and silver values. Mineralization in this interval is similar to the extensive overlying silver zone which was intersected between 376 and 496m and is characterized by a typical HSE assemblage of very high copper, gold and silver values with associated arsenic. This deep zone in hole FSDH041 is the only place outside of the well-defined, flat-lying tabular silver zone where high-grade silver values are seen, suggesting that it represents a feeder to the silver zone. The intersection lies some 400m below the overlying silver zone, implying substantial vertical continuity if they are connected.\nAdditional drilling is required to determine the geometry and orientation of the high-grade mineralization intersected in this hole, and its true width is currently uncertain.\nThe breccia bodies and porphyry intrusives in FSDH041 correlate well with those in hole FSDH032. The alteration and mineralization patterns are consistent with a high sulphidation system, with advanced argillic alteration accompanied by copper sulphides such as tennantite-covellite-chalcocite, overprinting a porphyry system with abundant “A” veins and remanent potassic alteration containing chalcopyrite and bornite. Holes FSDH041 and FSDH037 strongly suggest that mineralization is continuous between holes FSDH032 and FSDH043, opening an extensive area of very high mineral potential.\nHole FSDH045 was collared 200m north of FSDH041 and 200m south of FSDH037 and drilled towards the west at -76 degrees. The hole was abandoned at a depth of 359m in strongly altered and leached rock which created difficult drilling conditions. The hole ended above the projection of the silver zone and underlying sulphide mineralization, encountering two short, mineralized intervals as shown in the accompanying table.\nDrilling results continue to support our interpretation of Filo del Sol as a telescoped HSE / porphyry copper-gold system which has created a very large, diverse mineral system with variations in deposit geometry, grade distribution and mineralogy. All of these will have important implications for ongoing exploration and conceptual development scenarios. Mineralization can be generally grouped into three zones based on mineralogy. The shallowest zone is the oxide/sulphate zone, which is amenable to heap leach processing, and forms the design basis of the PFS project. This mineralization is the product of weathering, oxidation, and supergene enrichment of the underlying primary sulphide mineralization (comprised of both HSE mineralization and porphyry mineralization). Due to the telescoped nature of the deposit, the HSE and porphyry mineralization are generally overlapping or adjacent, with a general trend of HSE transitioning to porphyry at depth and to the east.\nHSE mineralization post-dates and overprints the earlier porphyry mineralization, increasing the copper, gold, silver, and arsenic grades as the mineralogy changes. Copper mineralization in the HSE zone generally consists of covellite/tennantite/chalcocite/bornite while the porphyry mineralization is more typically chalcopyrite/bornite/covellite.\nResults from this season’s program have exceeded expectations and provide strong evidence that the Company is beginning to outline a major mineral deposit, of which the reserve underpinning the January 2019 Pre-Feasibility Study is just a small part. With these latest results, the Company believes that the exploration target (see News Release dated June 25, 2020) of between 1.2 and 1.6 billion tonnes at 0.7% to 1.0% CuEq (in addition to the current mineral resource) will not only be realized but has obvious potential to be expanded. We also expect that the mining project scoped in the PFS could ultimately provide the initial stage of a much larger project. Additional exploration drilling, resource definition drilling, and metallurgical testwork planned for the upcoming field campaign will begin the process of investigating what that operation might look like.\nDrilling will continue until the end of May 2021, contingent on continued successful management of COVID-19 and weather conditions at the project site. Field operations will be paused for 6-8 weeks while the Company prepares the drills and camp facilities for continuous, year-round field operations. A program of comprehensive sulphide metallurgical testwork will also be initiated, with samples comprised of drill core from the ongoing program.\nAbout Filo del Sol\nFilo del Sol is a high-sulphidation epithermal copper-gold-silver deposit associated with one or more large porphyry copper-gold systems. Overlapping mineralizing events combined with weathering effects, including supergene enrichment, have created several different styles of mineralization, including structurally-controlled and breccia-hosted gold, manto-style high-grade silver (+/- copper) and high-grade supergene enriched copper within a broader envelope of disseminated, stockwork and breccia-hosted sulphide copper and gold mineralization. This complex geological history has created a heterogeneous orebody which is characterized by zones of very high-grade copper +/- gold +/- silver mineralization within a large envelope of more homogeneous, lower-grade mineralization.\nQualified Persons and Technical Notes\nThe scientific and technical disclosure for the Filo del Sol Project included in this news release have been reviewed and approved by Bob Carmichael, B.A.Sc., P.Eng. who is the Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101. Mr. Carmichael is Vice President, Exploration for the Company. Samples were cut at Filo Mining’s operations base near the town of Guañizuil, Argentina by Company personnel. Diamond drill core was sampled in 2 metre intervals (except where shortened by geological contacts) using a rock saw for sulphide mineralization. Oxide mineralization was cut with a core splitter in order to prevent dissolution of water-soluble copper minerals during the wet sawing process. Core diameter is a mix of PQ, HQ and NQ depending on the depth of the drill hole. Samples were bagged and tagged and packaged for shipment by truck to the ALS preparation laboratory in Mendoza, Argentina where they were crushed and a 500g split was pulverized to 85% passing 200 mesh. The prepared samples were sent to the ALS assay laboratories in either Lima, Peru or Santiago, Chile for copper, gold and silver assays, and multi-element ICP and sequential copper analyses. ALS is an accredited laboratory which is independent of the Company. Gold assays were by fire assay fusion with AAS finish on a 30g sample. Copper and silver were assayed by atomic absorption following a 4 acid digestion. Samples were also analyzed for a suite of 36 elements with ICP-ES and a sequential copper leach analysis was completed on each sample with copper greater than 500ppm (0.05%). Copper and gold standards as well as blanks and duplicates (field, preparation and analysis) were randomly inserted into the sampling sequence for Quality Control. On average, 9% of the submitted samples are Quality Control samples. No data quality problems were indicated by the QA/QC program.\nMineralized zones within the Filo del Sol deposit are typically flat-lying, or bulk porphyry-style zones and drilled widths in holes FSDH037 and FSDH045 are interpreted to be very close to true widths. The true width of the high-grade silicified zone in FSDH041 is unknown, and additional drilling is planned in order to understand its geometry.\nCopper Equivalent (CuEq) for drill intersections is calculated based on US$ 3.00/lb Cu, US$ 1,500/oz Au and US$ 18/oz Ag, with 80% metallurgical recoveries assumed for all metals. The formula is: CuEq % = Cu % + (0.7292 * Au g/t) + (0.0088 * Ag g/t).\nAbout Filo Mining\nFilo Mining is a Canadian exploration and development company focused on advancing its 100% owned Filo del Sol copper-gold-silver deposit located in Chile’s Region III and adjacent San Juan Province, Argentina. The Company’s shares are listed on the TSXV and Nasdaq First North Growth Market under and on the OTCQX.

The Environmental Impacts of Aggregate Extraction\nWith the exception of those who work in the building trades, the closest most of us ever come to “virgin” aggregate (that is, aggregate that comes straight from an aggregate mine and has not been reclaimed from rubble or other debris) is at home building stores. While a bag of stones or gravel may look fairly benign, the process of getting it to us is anything but benign. Aggregate is mined from the earth, either dug out of pits or blasted out of quarries. This process has many significant environmental impacts.\nCreating the pits or quarries requires the removal of virtually all natural vegetation, top soil and subsoil to reach the aggregate underneath. Not only does this lead to a loss of existing animal wildlife, it also leads to a huge loss of biodiversity as plants and aquatic habitats are destroyed. Moreover, adjacent eco-systems are affected by noise, dust, pollution and contaminated water.\nPits and quarries disrupt the existing movement of surface water and groundwater; they interrupt natural water recharge and can lead to reduced quantity and quality of drinking water for residents and wildlife near or downstream from a quarry site.\nMost old pits and quarries are not being properly rehabilitated. As noted in one study “less than half of the land disturbed for aggregate production between 1992 and 2001 has actually been rehabilitated.” The province classifies pits and quarries as “interim uses of the land” and requires 100% rehabilitation of pits and quarries. Clearly this requirement is not being met. Destroyed ecosystems and source water aquifers are irreplaceable. This is not an interim land use. The landscape is blotted with destructive pits and quarries, and species of all kinds endure permanent negative impacts.\nA more detailed picture of the environmental impact of aggregate mining is outlined in a 2005 legal challenge to the expansion of an existing quarry in the Niagara Escarpment. The report focuses on the following potential environmental impacts:\n- Potential impairment of water quality on the site, including harm to the aquifer\n- The water quality of residential wells close by could be harmed\n- The water level of on-site lakes could be reduced, detrimentally affecting provincially specific wetlands\n- Heightened summer water temperature in an on-site lake could have a detrimental impact on the\nviability of cold water fish in an adjacent stream\nPotential harm to on-site and off-site wetlands\n- Loss of habitat for the Jefferson Salamander, which is designated as threatened under the federal Species at Risk Act\n- Potential loss and fragmentation of continuous natural environment\nOf course, each pit or quarry has unique characteristics and impacts, but every pit or quarry will degrade the natural environment. For pits or quarries situated on lands designated as ecologically significant, this degradation has an even greater adverse impact.\nFor communities, the displacement of water resources is one of the biggest concerns pits and quarries pose. However, there are many other concerns. Beyond the physical changes to the landscape, the daily barrage of noise, dust and exhaust produced by hundreds of dump trucks hauling aggregate can have serious effects on the health of people living nearby.\nWinfield, M and A.

55	What are the basic requirements for a range hood to be considered high-efficiency in terms of noise level?	To be considered high-efficiency, the hood must be certified by the Home Ventilating Institute (HVI) or the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) to provide at least one speed setting that can deliver 100 cfm at less than 3 sones. However, range hoods with a minimum airflow setting of 400 cfm or more are exempt from this noise requirement.	['2022 Kitchen Exhaust Requirements\nIndoor air quality (IAQ) is an important part of today’s Gas vs Electric appliance debate. The 2022 energy code proposes additional steps to improve indoor air quality.\nIndoor Air Quality\nGas furnaces and water heaters are designed to vent pollution outside. But stoves are often inefficiently vented; in many cases, they’re entirely unvented. Recent studies conducted or referenced by the EPA, Rocky Mountain Institute, Sierra Club and Harvard University have shown that on average, most kitchens’ indoor air quality falls within harmful levels.\nBurning fossil fuels in your house is an obvious pollutant, but cooking itself creates IAQ issues, so it’s important to vent a stove, no matter what the fuel source is.\nCooking creates pollutants from heated oil, fat and spices, so choosing a cleaner -burning fuel source does not eliminate the need for local ventilation. The variety of pollutants released during cooking have been linked to health concerns including asthma, fatigue and headaches (see the Physicians for Social Responsibility for information and resources).\nRange Hood Code Requirements\nGood news: The most effective way to create a healthier kitchen environment is to install a high-efficiency range hood! To be considered high efficiency, the hood needs a high cubic feet per minute (cfm) rating for air changes and a low sones (noise) rating.\nThe 2022 Single Family Residential and Multi-Family code further defines the required Capture Efficiency Ratings (CE) per Dwelling unit floor area for both Electric and Gas ranges as the fraction of emitted tracer gas that is directly exhausted by a range hood.\nTwo items of note in the code:\n- Hoods over natural gas ranges require a higher CE or CFM than those over electric ranges, and\n- Homes with a smaller floor area have less opportunity to dilute cooking contaminants and therefore also require a higher CE or CFM.\nRequirements are listed in Table 150.0-G\nTable 150.0-G Kitchen Range Hood Airflow Rates (cfm) and ASTM E3087 Capture Efficiency (CE) Ratings According to Dwelling Unit Floor Area and Kitchen Range Fuel Type\n|Dwelling Unit Floor Area (ft2)||Hood Over Electric Range||Hood Over Natural Gas|\n|>1500||50% CE or 110 cfm||70% CE or 180 cfm|\n|>1000 - 1500||50% CE or 110 cfm||80% CE or 250 cfm|\n|750 - 1000||55% CE or 130 cfm||85% CE or 280 cfm|\n|<750||65% CE or 160 cfm||85% CE or 280 cfm|\nOther Considerations for Kitchen Ventilation\nOther exhaust fans, including downdraft fans, must meet a minimum of 300 cfm. For Enclosed Kitchens, a capacity of 5 Air Changes per Hour (ACH) would need to be calculated for the project.\nAdditionally, the energy code requires a HERS verification, stating that the hood is certified by the Home Ventilating Institute (HVI) or the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM), to provide at least one speed setting that can deliver 100 cfm at less than 3 sones. If the range hood has a minimum airflow setting of 400 cfm or more, they are exempt from the noise requirement. Interested in becoming a HERS Rater?

56	digital vs analog delay pedal differences	Digital delay pedals offer clearer reproduction of repeats and longer delay times, while analog delay pedals have warmer echo repeats but shorter delay times of around 600ms.	['Best Delay Pedals\nWhen you think of delay pedals, for most guitarists U2’s the Edge instantly comes to mind. Known for being a sonic architect rather than a guitar virtuoso, his instantly recognizable wall of sound is due largely to the modest delay pedal. A delay pedal is a great addition to your pedal board and some of the best delay pedals should add astounding depth to your playing.\nDelay pedal effects have been around since the 50’s and through the decades legends such as Hendrix, Clapton, David Gilmour, and Eddie Van Halen have all used some form of delay. It wasn’t until the 80’s with both the introduction of the inexpensive Boss DD-2 digital delay and Irish rockers U2 that the delay pedal was brought to the mainstream guitarist. Now there are a multitude of modern delays. Delay pedals come in all shapes and sizes but can be broken down into three choices: analog, digital and a multi effects unit. And of those there are boutique or mass produced pedals.\nNote for Newbies\nIf you’re absolutely new to delay pedals, the delay effect is one that echoes what you’ve just played e.g. delay, delay, delay… to fade. This is not to be confused with reverb commonly built into the amp. This effect is like singing in the bathroom (I know you do) with your voice reflecting off the walls.\nThe man, the myth, the delay pedal.\nMass Production Delay Pedals\nMass production pedals tend to be, more often than not, digital. Most are commonly priced around $150, however high end ranges can get expensive like the at $249. Of the mass produced pedals you’re most likely to come across brands like DigiTech, Boss, DigiTech HardWire, Marshall, Vox, Electro-Harmonix, Maxon, Ibanez, Line 6, MXR and many of the cheaper brands like Behringer, Guyatone and Belcat. One of the best delay pedals that are built in large quantities is the MXR Carbon Copy which is analog. Dunlop has also acquired Way Huge so the Aqua Puss Analog Delay should count now as a mass produced pedal.\nBoutique Delay Pedals\nBoutique makers are known for creating some of the best delay pedals on the market. However this comes at a cost. Due to smaller runs and limited resources, a boutique delay pedal usually starts from $150 and up, with most costing over the $200 mark. But it’s almost guaranteed that a boutique pedal will be true bypass, to circumvent any tone suckage. Some of the most well known boutique delay pedal makers are: Fulltone, Plush, Diamond, Mad Professor, Subdecay, Pigtronix, Wampler, T-Rex, Homebrew, Empress, Red Witch, Lovepedal, Malekko and Tortuga to name just a few.\nDigital Delay Pedals\nBoss DD-7 Digital Delay Pedal\nA digital delay pedal is known for its clarity in reproduction of the repeats. Digital delays also have longer delay times than their analog counterparts. But don’t get caught up on long delays being better, as they can sound out of place and can even confuse your own playing. Short 15 ms to 1 second delays are the most useable. Long delays with 2 to 8 second times are probably not that practical, not even the Edge has them that long! Mass produced digital delay pedals tend to be a bit “smarter” than their boutique counterparts having functions like looper, tap tempo or different modelling features. The and HardWire Delay Looper DL-8 are two such pedals. Cheaper pedals may have lower quality sampling rate due to less onboard memory. Looper pedals will definitely have more RAM onboard. Boutique digital delays are less frequent, but they do exist, such as the oddly name Wampler Faux AnalogEcho, which is actually a digital stompbox based on the Princeton Technology’s PT2399 Echo Processor IC.\nAnalog Delay Pedals\nMalekko Ekko 616 Analog Delay Boutique Pedal\nAnalog delay pedals are likely to have warmer echo repeats, though their delay times are much shorter at somewhere around 600ms. Most true analog delays will use bucket brigade technology “the stored analogue signal is moved along the line of capacitors, one step at each clock cycle.” – Wiki. Some also have a modulation effect where the sounds are doubled, the same as a chorus. Several digital pedals can emulate this as well. There are some inherent problems associated with analog delays such as clock noise - a whine on longer repeats. The Malekko Ekko 616 Analog Delay ($149.99) is said to eliminate this problem and it’s inexpensive too for a boutique pedal.\nMany pro guitarists even have two or more delays on their pedal board. One set to long repeats while the other does the short ones for quicker changes. So you can have the best of both worlds and get an analog pedal to do the short repeats while a digital does the longer.\nMulti Effects Units\nDigiTech RP1000 Mulit-Effects Unit\nMulti Effects units are digital modelling effects with one of the features usually being a delay. The big brands have cornered this market such as Boss GT and ME series, DigiTech RP series and Line 6 POD’s. Each unit also models hundreds of amps, cabinets and effects. The RP355 ($199.99) has several delay pedal models including the DigiTech Analog Delay, Boss DM-2, DigiTech Digital Delay, DigiTech Pong Delay and an EP-2 Echoplex Tape Echo. The price is quite economical in comparison to a dedicated stompbox. A DigiTech RP90 Multi-Effects Pedal costs $99.99 compared to DigiTech’s own DigiDelay at $99.95, which only does delay. Both are digital and the RP90 Multi-Effects will also have a more powerful processor. The down sides could be the quality of the samples, cheap DACs and also their ease of use.\nAmpliTube iRig on an iPad\nLastly there is one other way to get a delay effect - using computer modelling software such as Guitar Rig, AmpliTube or GarageBand for Macs.

57	historic train stations art deco mosaic murals architecture restoration projects details	Both historic train stations feature notable Art Deco architectural elements and have undergone significant restoration. Cincinnati's Union Terminal contains unique mosaic murals with industrial themes that took over two years to design and build, with some relocated to the Duke Energy Convention Center. The Buffalo Central Terminal has received multiple restoration grants, including $61 million through the Regional Revitalization Partnership and $5 million from Empire State Development Corporation for improvements to its historic entry lobby and passenger concourse.	"['MOVED BY HISTORY\nThe Buffalo Central Terminal has long been the people’s palace. Opened in 1929 to serve more than 200 trains and 10,000 passengers daily. An Art Deco icon integral to Buffalo’s architectural legacy, the Buffalo Central Terminal was placed on both the National and State Registers of Historical Places in 1984. Despite the last train having left the station in 1979, the Terminal’s importance as both a major piece of transportation infrastructure and a cultural asset in the greater Broadway-Fillmore neighborhood make its restoration a singular opportunity for the region.\nIn 1997, the 12.5-acre Buffalo Central Terminal site was acquired by the non-profit Central Terminal Restoration Corporation (CTRC). For 25 years the CTRC has been an active steward of the building, relentlessly advocating for the Terminal.\nOur priorities are both simple and monumental. The Terminal will be a hub of activity – a beacon and a destination that attracts people and investment. Together, we will celebrate and foster community voice and connections that shape broader revitalization efforts in Broadway-Fillmore. The Terminal will join and elevate the strong future of the city and region.\nBuilding Our Future Era\nThe Next Chapter Begins with the Master Plan\nA Request for Expression of Interest (RFEI) is released to solicit Development Partner(s) for the reuse of the Buffalo Central Terminal.\nThe CTRC is awarded $61 million through the Regional Revitalization Partnership, a major public and philanthropic initiative to spur economic growth on Buffalo’s East Side and across Western New York.\nThe Central Terminal is award $1.5 million through the Broadway-Fillmore Downtown Revitalization Initiative to support enhancements to the Great Lawn.\nThe Central Terminal receives a Community Placemaking Grant from the Project for Public Spaces to transform the Terminal’s Great Lawn from an under-designed, grassy lawn into a highly activated green space for the sharing of civic experiences.\nThe Master Plan is completed after an extensive community engagement effort.

The building underwent two and a half years of major building renovations (including a full structural restoration) in order to save it for future generations, and visitors are back to enjoying this historic venue!\nTreasured history and architecture\nDoes this remind you of anything? The building’s unique façade has found its way into television. Union Terminal was the inspiration behind The Hall of Justice, the headquarters for the Justice League in the 1970s cartoon Super Friends. It's also been seen in the television shows “Invasion” and “The Flash” and the 1996 comic book series, Terminal City.\nThe building itself has quite a story to tell. Built from 1929-1933, the Art Deco-style Union Terminal building was originally home to a busy train station. City council voted to name Union Terminal a National Historic Landmark in 1973 after Southern Railway purchased the property and wanted to tear it down to make more room for their operations. The rich history and the standout architecture was too significant of a contribution to the city to lose. From 1968-1970, it was redeveloped as the Cincinnati Science Museum. Next, in 1980, the building was purchased by the city and developed into a shopping mall. The mall lasted 2 years, then was vacant until 1990 when the Cincinnati Museum Center opened.\nCincinnati Union Terminal was a huge accomplishment when it was built and contains intricate design features making it stand out as a landmark structure. Talented artists were commissioned to create the one-of-a-kind mosaics and ceiling murals inside the building. Larger-than-life mosaic murals featuring different industrial themes used to be located throughout the building. Some of these murals were moved to the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport when parts of the building were demolished and can now be seen along the western wall of Duke Energy Convention Center. These impressive mosaics alone took over two years to design and build. The ceiling murals are oil on canvas and after countless years of smoke, dirt and dust had dulled them, they have been restored to their original glory. On the front of the building are two bas relief carvings from 1932. The carvings took months to create and represent transportation and commerce.\nThis historic building is one that Cincinnati treasures. It's home to the largest half-dome in the Western Hemisphere. Soldiers were welcomed back from World War II within its walls. Over three million troops passed through Union Terminal over the course of the war, and the USO used the building as a lounge. During a time of great segregation, it should be noted that the USO did not discriminate against the soldiers based on race or religion. Union Terminal also played an important role in allowing African Americans to gain employment during segregation. They were often hired as porters on the trains, allowing them to travel easily and spread their ideas and gain employment across the country. This iconic building stands out on the horizon and is recognizable as a piece of Cincinnati and American history.\nThe Duke Energy Children’s Museum is a favorite spot for visitors ages 12 and under. This area is where kids can explore, build, see live animals, splash, dress-up, learn and play.\nThe permanent exhibit called Inside the Grin contains a giant-sized set of teeth. With an enormous tooth brush and six feet of floss, kids have fun learning how to take care of this huge set of chompers.\nBe sure to check out some of the other special features found in the Children’s Museum.\n- Kidspace is a playlab encouraging learning in areas like science, technology, engineering, art and math. It's filled with creative materials like yarn, beads, papers, lights, shadows, puppets and more. They have guided workshops and time for free exploration when visitors learn about topics like painting, ceramics, sewing, light and shadows, assembly processes and 3D printing.\n- Children five and under try out their creativity at The Super Sprouts arts and crafts program. They explore different artists, cultures, movement and artistic styles.\n- The Dance Party encourages kids to stay healthy while they dance, move, and burn energy in the Corbett Theater.\n- During Story Tree Time, museum storytellers share a story with guests. Special celebrities like Cinderella or Shrek sometimes make an appearance as the featured story teller.\nDon't miss a chance to see five rare dinosaur specimens and enjoy interactive exhibits in Dinosaur Hall in the Museum of Natural History and Science; or walk the cobblestone streets of 1850's Cincinnati riverfront in the reimagined Public Landing in the Cincinnati History Museum. Visit the Science Interactives Gallery STEM inspired exhibit, which is part of the Museum of Natural History & Science, and travel to space with the Neil Armstrong Space Exploration Gallery.

58	how authors pitch social media websites media what strategies work	Authors can use multiple strategies for pitching across different channels. For social media, they should focus on being authentic and service-oriented, avoiding hard sells while establishing connections through helpful contributions and comments on other websites and blogs. They can tweet with links or content snippets, and engage with book bloggers who have influence in particular genres. For websites, authors should include essential elements like book information, author bios, excerpts, media coverage, testimonials, and contact information. When pitching to traditional media, authors should prepare press kits with releases, bios, and interview questions, targeting both book reviewers and off-the-book-page media 4 months before publication. Video pitches can be simple and authentic, showing the author discussing their work and its importance.	['Authors today need a whole new attitude toward the all-important pitch.\nUntil now, the author pitch was defined as a hard-sell verbal punch to persuade agents and editors to take on their book. It was typically brief, high-concept, often hyperbolic and was designed to convince the agent standing there that the book was fabulous and so was the author.\nBut as with everything else in the book business, pitching too has changed, evolving with the times into something different and actually much more interesting.\nChoosing the right pitch for the job\nLike all good pitchers on the mound, authors today need a few tricks up their sleeves. They need to choose the right pitch for the job, taking aim directly at readers, retailers, social networks and media. Unlike the old arm-twisting approach, the new pitch doesn’t try to persuade these folks they’re going to love your book.\nInstead you let them know what you’ve written in a way that makes them want to read it. Your goal is to hear back: “Sounds interesting. How do I get a copy?”\nThe new approach\nThe new pitch isn’t a hard sell or painful duty, but rather an extension of your creative process. This is a very different approach. It’s all about using the right words to represent your work. The oldest adage about good writing also applies here: Show, don’t tell. And by extension: Show, don’t sell.\nThree new developments — the etiquette of the softer sell, online connectivity and independent self-publishing — have revolutionized pitching. These have opened up a whole new world of alternative ways to craft different types of pitches, depending on your specific book and what it needs. The new pitch may be delivered or written directly to potential readers, reviewers, book bloggers, feature writers, interviewers – and it may be in person or online.\nIn many cases, the author has no intention of seeking either an agent or a conventional publisher. For those writers seeking a traditional book deal, however, pitches may still be directed at an agent or acquisitions editor, either in writing or at face-to-face writers conferences with blind-date or ask-the-pro sessions.\nThe new author pitch in action\nPitching directly to readers\nFeature a short description of your book on your website. In this case, I recommend a one-paragraph straightforward description. No excessive adjectives or adverbs. Just very well-crafted essential information about the book’s story and characters, whether it’s a novel, romance, mystery, YA, memoir or nonfiction how-to book.\nYou can also pitch on your blog, but in a different manner. The interactive features built into blogs provide the opportunity to discuss the process of your writing, offer sample chunks or chapters, and invite feedback. You can establish a dialogue with your readers to captivate their interest and increases the potential for ultimate sales.\nIn both cases the reader gets to know you without your having to deliver a rapid-fire biography, including credits, education, track record, and other forms of visibility, media and otherwise. That traditional platform pitch can appear elsewhere on your website under an “author” tab, and it can be as long as necessary.\nPitching to a social network\nThis kind of pitch involves reaching out to comment on other websites and blogs where you can be helpful and offer a contribution. It can include tweeting, with either links or referrals, or by distilling selections of your content into 140-character haikus.\nSocial networking is like entering a cafe or front-porch conversation, and adding your two cents about the topic under discussion. This is the most subtle form of pitching and requires a keen sense of online etiquette. Don’t begin by saying you’re an expert, and expect everyone to sit up and listen. Be altruistic, service- oriented, and keep yourself out of it on a personal level until you’ve established some ongoing connections.\nA variation on this approach is a pitch to book bloggers who build powerful websites with dialogue that usually focuses on a particular genre. They discuss, review, interview and generally chat up a storm about a book or author they like. These days traditional publishers are courting book bloggers who have tremendous influence in a particular field. We’ve known for years, for example, that Mommy bloggers are well organized and have created many bestsellers in parenting and baby care categories. And the legendary self-publishing phenom Amanda Hocking reached her multimillion sales level only after going viral with book bloggers who specialized in YA vampire romances.\nPitching to retailers\nIt takes courage to walk into a bookstore and talk about your book. Reading or memorizing isn’t natural and can appear canned, so the best technique is old-fashioned sincerity. This means telling the truth – you’ve worked hard, you care about this book, you want them to read it and give it a chance on their shelves, or better yet on the front table if they will agree to a reading and author signing. It can help if it’s your neighborhood bookstore, where you browse and shop regularly. But ultimately the proof will be in the pudding: will the buyer believe in you enough to sample the content and will they like it. Bookstores will be especially interested if you can guarantee crowd of local friends who’ll fill seats and buy a stack of copies.\nPitching to the media\nLocal print and broadcast media are always looking for material about local authors and their work. They have space to fill with material to attract advertisers. Offering them a sample of your book or interview may be done with a carefully written press release, or, if their internal process is more informal and easily accessed, you can call them up or go into their offices. In either case, they’ll want to hear a short description of who you are, since there may be a strong local personality hook, and also what you’ve written, particularly if you’re known in the community or the content has a local angle.\nPitching to the virtual media takes less dressing up. There are many websites that feature book reviews, interviews, and samples of new books, usually self-published but occasionally from traditional houses. Here, as always, the drill is to be authentic, brief, and provide either content or service that fits their purpose.\nThe video pitch\nIn the YouTube era, your visually delivered pitch doesn’t have to be slick, heavily scripted, or shot with fancy cameras and lights. Put your digital camera on a tripod or ask a member of your family to shoot you at your desk or walking outside. Again, don’t read, just be yourself. Tell us the story, how and why you wrote the book, and why it’s important to you. Enough said. This variety of pitch can be directed at your readers, or as a link when approaching busy retailers, book bloggers, and media professionals.\nWhat about you?\nHave a few tricks up your sleeve? We look forward to hearing about your experiences in the age of the new author pitch.', 'PUBLISHED JULY/AUGUST 2019\nby Brian Feinblum, CMO and Senior Vice President, Media Connect —\nBook publishers of all genres and sizes need a lot of help with branding-and it can come from working more productively with their authors.\nSo, what is branding for a publisher?\nI had the opportunity to speak at IBPA’s annual conference in Chicago on this very topic. Here is what I shared: A brand is your name, image, and voice. It’s how others discover and perceive you. It shows in all that you do, say, and publish.\nIt is also your:\n- Look and feel of your books\n- Company website content and appearance\n- Social media profiles and level of activity and engagement\n- Business cards\n- Letterhead (digital and print)\n- Press releases\n- Email signature\n- In your news media coverage\n- When you speak to groups\n- Interact with industry professionals\nMost publishers stink at branding. Many consumers couldn’t distinguish the brand of one publisher from another. But some publishers do it right.\nWiley puts its name on the front cover of all of its books. There’s a uniform look to their books, and a certain caliber of author and content is provided.\nMorgan James, a leading hybrid publisher, distinguishes its books with its charitable ways. On the back of every book cover is a reference to Habitat for Humanity, to which it donates a certain percentage of proceeds.\nSome authors and book series are also good at branding-and have a recognizable image.\nPublishers must define their brand first by knowing their why. Why do you publish books? What’s your mission? What standards do you employ for the books that you publish? In what voice do you speak in?Publishers need to ask of themselves: What’s unique, fresh, different, better, or first about the books I publish? You need to identify what your books promise to do for readers. What ties your books together? A good publishing brand sells more books, earns you media coverage, helps recruit quality authors to publish with you, and gets you noticed in the book industry.\nRule No. 1: Brand your books!\n- Develop a consistent look for your books.\n- Put in an introductory message into every book.\n- Place an ad in each book to highlight your website.\n- Publish a certain caliber of author.\nNext, develop a tagline for your company. What do you promise to offer readers? What makes your book distinguishable? Post the tagline everywhere. It becomes your mantra.\nBranding on Social Media\nTo brand via social media makes a lot of sense, but choose your platforms wisely. You can’t be everywhere all the time, so don’t try to be.\nProfessionally, a publisher’s president/owner should be on LinkedIn. The publishing company should have a Facebook page, Twitter handle, and YouTube channel. If you or your books are visual and attractive, consider using Instagram or Pinterest.\nHave a posting schedule. It can’t be random, haphazard, or infrequent. Consistency is key. Frequency should follow industry norms and what benefits you, but don’t obsess and live online 24/7.\nAuthors must do the same with social media. You, as the publisher, should be connected online with all of your authors. Repost each other’s stuff. Don’t be too salesy in your posts. Use visuals, like graphs, photos, or drawings, to get attention.\nWhen it comes to blogs, publishers should:\n- Have one\n- Let authors contribute to your blog\n- Interview people for your blog\n- Set an editorial calendar of one to two posts per week\n- Use it on your social media\nWhat can a publisher blog about?\n- What’s new or coming out soon\n- Authors in the news\n- Comments on book industry\n- Spotting trends on books\n- Celebrating backlist milestones or anniversaries\n- They should be easy to read and navigate\n- Updated regularly\n- Have author websites link to your site\nWhat should a publisher’s site include?\n- Catalog of books\n- Book covers\n- Descriptions of books\n- Book reviews\n- Media coverage about books\n- Testimonials for each title\n- Chapter examples\n- Price/order info/buy button\n- About the company\n- Contact page with social media links\n- Highlight successes\n- Share vision and philosophy\n- News about you\n- Your bio\n- Q&A with you\n- List of upcoming events for company/authors\n- Link to a charity if you support one\n- A page outlining your manuscript submission guidelines and policies\nDon’t just use words. Focus on fonts, colors, images, audio, and video.\nAuthor websites should be created six months prior to a publication date and have:\n- About the book\n- About the author\n- Summary of past books\n- Short excerpts for upcoming book\n- Free downloadable chapter and table of contents\n- Media scheduled or links to past media\n- Scheduled or list of past speaker appearances\n- Press releases\n- Author Q&A\n- Blog or newsletter\n- Something free people can sign up for\n- Charity connection page\n- Facts/stats related to the book\n- Buy button/preorders\n- Contact page and social media links\nHow can authors market and promote themselves?\n- Schedule speaking appearances and bookstore signings\n- Social media activity\n- Book giveaways\n- Paid reviews\n- Getting traditional media exposure\n- Securing digital media coverage\n- Setting up affiliate sales\nAuthors must put together a press kit for the media, which should include a press release, author bio, suggested interview questions, excerpts, testimonials, and several story-ready pieces that touch on themes from your book.\nContact Targeted Media\nAuthors will need to send out advance review copies of their book to book reviewers and long-lead media four months prior to publication date.\nTwo months prior to pub date, and continuing for three to four months post-publication date, authors must contact off-the-book-page media (people who will do something other than a book review).\n- Local and national TV shows\n- Local and national radio shows\n- Daily and weekly newspapers\n- Trade publications\n- Major media websites\n- Online book reviews\nYou should seek out:\n- Feature stories\n- Quotes in a story\n- Guest posts\n- Byline articles\n- Book excerpts\nPublishers need media coverage. They should contact writer magazines, book industry trades, and digital media that covers books and publishing. Contact media that covers an industry, too. For instance, contact parenting publications if you publish children’s books, or contact business media if you publish business books-not just book reviewers or those who cover books.\nPublishers can seek out stories that:\n- Center on controversial books or topics\n- Discuss free speech, literacy, or reading trends\n- Cover the business of book publishing\n- Tackle a specific genre\nFind your biggest allies. An author’s list of contacts has a few whales-those who have large social media followings, big email lists, and influencer status. These people are your gold. Call them, send them an email, woo them. Beg for a favor or trade something of value-or even pay them-to help you.\nAsk them for:\n- A bulk buy of your book (they can give as gifts or resell)\n- Their help in sharing a sales letter to their lists\n- An introduction to a handful of key people\n- A free gift to provide your readers\nPublishers, ask all of your authors to help one another and to send sales letter offers to each other’s lists.\nAdditional steps publishers should take:\n- Provide authors with resources and helpful information about marketing and publicity.\n- Set expectations for each of them of what you want them to do.\n- Follow up with them regularly and ask then to email a weekly update of outreach and results (create a template for them).\n- Introduce your authors to each other-maybe have backlist authors mentor the new ones.\nBook sales require crafting ideas, planning to execute, knowledge of how to market, skills training to market books, awareness of what could be done, and connections to media, bookstores, libraries, and organizations. But, mostly, it demands time and money. Authors must invest in themselves and really work at getting sales. Encourage your authors to hire a PR consultant or, even better, a book publicist. They should team up to make sure everything that’s needed gets addressed.\nThere should be time to brainstorm, dream, and plan-but then it’s time to focus on execution.\nWorking With Authors\nConsider what and who you publish:\n- Recruit authors who support your brand and mission.\n- Take on promotable books.\n- Work with authors who are committed to help and be active.\n- Find authors willing to invest funds into a PR campaign.\n- Seek out marketing-minded authors.\n- Look for writers with a decent platform.\n- They must be qualified to write on the topic of their book.\n- They need to have a relevant book that is well written.\n- They should have a built-in way to tie the book into a holiday, season, anniversary, honorary day, upcoming event, the news cycle, or something popular.\nYour brand grows when you publish:\n- Books people want or need\n- Established authors\n- Books by promotable authors\nPush your authors. Formulate materials that will help your authors, including:\n- Checklists of dos and dont’s\n- Timeline of activity\n- Media coaching\n- Website models\n- Set deadlines and monitor activities\n- Address their challenges, fears, needs\n- Schedule brainstorming calls\n- Lists of resources\n- Play to their strengths and passions-but encourage them to do what’s needed even if they aren’t interested\n- Set goals and define metrics for success\n- Craft training videos and tutorials on speaking, social media, getting reviews, and other key areas\nWhat you do as a publisher is important. Books matter. You got into book publishing, most likely, not for the money, but because you want to follow your passions, call upon your skills, and support books and the many voices that need to be shared.

59	schrodinger equation vs string theory mathematics which is more basic	The Schrodinger equation represents more basic mathematics, as it deals with conventional wave functions and quantum mechanics, while string theory involves much more complex and esoteric mathematics that has been described as an advanced branch of algebraic geometry. String theory requires understanding of complex concepts like 10-dimensional spaces and supersymmetry, going far beyond the foundational quantum mechanics mathematics.	"['|Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum|\nAuthor: Leonard Susskind, Art Friedman\nThere are lots of people who want to know about quantum mechanics just because it is interesting. Is this a book for them?\nThis is the second volume in the planned series ""The Theoretical Minimum"", which isn\'t really a good title because it suggests that some how the math is left out (see our review of Vol 1). In both this and the first volume this isn\'t the case. What is left out is the nitpicky proofs that you would have to go though in any ""proper"" academic course. This book doesn\'t duck the math, it simply presents it as part of the narrative. What this means is that if you are math phobic you aren\'t going to get very far with this book. Indeed if you are a complete lay person and haven\'t done any physics or math then similarly you aren\'t going to get much from this book. This is not a book for the general reader.\nThe ideal reader for this book is someone who has either done a conventional course in QM or is currently doing one. The standard approach to QM is to work through some of the experiments - Young\'s Slits etc - and then present the Schrodinger equation and spend the rest of the time solving it and explaining what a Hilbert space is all about. At the end of the course you can do the sums and perhaps answer the exam questions, but you probably don\'t ""get"" QM in any depth.\nIf you want to ""get"" QM in much deeper depth then this book is for you.\nInstead of starting with a discussion of all of the experiments that prove that reality isn\'t particle and it isn\'t wave, the book takes a different approach. It starts from the idea of a simple quantum system - a spin-1 particle and then works its way through the classical and quantum versions of the theory that applies to it.\nThis approach de-emphasizes the Schrodinger equation and emphasizes the operator approach. This means you get the bones of QM without having to worry about integrals or normalizable functions. Put another way, you start off with a finite-dimensional Hilbert space.\nChapter 3 introduces the basics of QM - operators, matrices, eigenvalues and eigenstates, Hermitian operators, orthogonal basis and so on. All this is done using the bra and ket notation, which makes things seem easy and logical because of the way the bras and kets just fit together. This is the right way to do things because starting from the wave function and trying to convert to using bra and ket notation later on isn\'t easy and it can be very confusing.\nFrom this point the book moves its way through time development and Unitary operators and the role of the Hamiltonian. We also learn about uncertainty in the most general possible way and discover the Heisenberg uncertainty principle as a special case of the general.\nFor many readers the highlight of the entire book will be entanglement, covered in Chapters 6 and 7. This is the mysterious property of QM that Einstein called ""spooky action at a distance"". While many physicists manage to understand entanglement, many of them don\'t see what troubled Einstein. These chapters explains exactly what is so odd about entanglement in terms of the difference setups needed to simulate an entangled system. This is a really great read if you are trying to come to terms with quantum computation.\nThe only disappointment is that just as you feel that you can, at last perhaps, understand the Bell inequality, Chapter 7 comes to an end without discussing it. Similarly the whole topic of quantum computers is ignored.\nThe final three chapters are about working back from the finite- dimensional operator description of QM to the more traditional materials of an introductory QM course - the wave function, Schrodinger\'s equation, position and momentum representations, the Fourier transform between position and momentum states and finally the harmonic oscillator, which prepares the ground for quantum field theory. In fact the whole book provides a much better approach to QM if your ultimate aim is to learn QFT.\nWhat is missing?\nThe big omission is the solution of the hydrogen atom. You don\'t get to see that the Schrodinger equation and the Hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom give you a near complete explanation of the observed spectra and the start of theoretical chemistry. However, this is only supposed to be a lightweight introduction to QM and the solution of the hydrogen atom is very math heavy.\nAll the way through the book there are non-technical discussions of what is going on. These are usually missing from lesser courses on the subject. The comments on wave function collapse and measurement as entanglement are worth the cost of the book on their own and will keep you awake at night.\nHighly recommended as long as you can cope with the math.\n|Last Updated ( Thursday, 18 January 2018 )|', 'Can ever more abstruseness and distance from experimental results reveal physical truths? asks Nobel laureate Philip Anderson.\nFour centuries ago Francis Bacon, in his Novum Organum , outlined the philosophy that came to be the distinguishing characteristic of modern science. This philosophy held that knowledge of the nature of things was to be gained by the acute observation of nature, not by the study of authoritative texts or of holy books, or from imaginative flights of human fancy. The resulting explosive growth in our understanding of the universe and of our ability to manipulate it cannot be gainsaid; whatever one may say about the technical ingenuity of the medieval Chinese or the early mathematical discoveries of the Indians and the Arabs, one has to concede that nothing remotely resembling modern systematic science developed in those cultures.\nMany of us in the physics community have become increasingly disturbed by the growing hegemony in a major subfield of our subject of what we see as a revival of the medieval, pre-Baconian mode of thinking: that the universe is designed on some simple basic principle that can be discovered by the exercise of pure reason, unaided, in fact unencumbered, by experimental study. Such would seem to be the thinking of the community of ""string theorists"", who in the past two decades have achieved a dominant position in theoretical physics. Every research physics department worldwide with any pretensions looks to have its own string-theory group of at least two, since only a few string theorists talk physics to anyone else. String theory has produced at least three media superstars, whose books and TV interviews bring to physics departments flocks of students ambitious to join this brilliant enterprise, which, it has been said, reveals ""the language in which God wrote the world"".\nPeter Woit, in a strongly argued and serious book, has taken on the task of analysing this situation. Woit, a mathematician at Columbia University, is neither a sour-grapes sorehead nor a sensationalist amateur, as he makes clear by describing the complex mathematics of string theory in what may be excessive detail for many readers without, so far as I can tell, many really serious errors. He is an admirer of Ed Witten, the fabulous mathematician-physicist who has been the guru of string theory for several decades. Woit took his degree at Princeton University, learning quantum-field theory from several of its most influential modern exponents, and he keeps in touch with the field through numerous contacts. Indeed, after spending several chapters on the history of modern particle theory, Woit adds a long and highly technical chapter praising the many exciting mathematical discoveries that have resulted from the complications of superstring theory - mathematical developments that, inter alia , earned Witten an unprecedented and well-deserved Fields Medal and contributed to the stellar career in mathematics of Sir Michael Atiyah, former president of the Royal Society.\nHow then can the enterprise on which all these unquestionably brilliant people are engaged have gone so far off the rails as to merit the physicist Wolfgang Pauli\'s famous put-down, ""That\'s not even wrong!""? This needs a little history, which Woit describes in the early chapters. (The experimental bits are a bit shaky, though.) The history concludes with an unexpected and glorious success: the so-called standard model, which was constructed in roughly 1965-75, by many of the same theorists who carried on into string theory. This marvellous structure classifies all of the bewildering array of known ""elementary"" particles and fields by means of three families of four ""particles"" (fermions) each, and two ""gauge"" symmetry groups that imply two sets of ""fields"" (bosons) that are responsible for interactions of a particularly simple type among the particles.\nThe way in which this structural classification fell into place, and the great leaps of imagination involved, justifies a degree of hubris among the few dozen truly extraordinary individuals who discovered it. It has also the very special feature that the ostensible world picture we see at the ordinary chemical scale has very little resemblance to the underlying structure, but instead is emergent from it: for instance, neither nucleons nor light quanta are fundamental to the standard model (the electron happens to be). However, both this hubris, and the complexity of the result, fed the temptation to go on leaping, and to forget that each of these earlier leaps, without exception, had taken off from some feature of the solid experimental facts laboriously gathered over the years.\nIt is conventional to say that the standard model vitiated all of particle theory as we had come to know it because everything measured since 1975 has ""agreed"" with it. This is problematical; what is true is that measurements since 1975 have left the structure intact, but with modifications in detail. Some of these modifications are very ad hoc, such as those necessary to fit the observed weak-time asymmetry, and the neutrino masses and oscillations. As so modified, there remain at least 25 arbitrary constants that must be determined from experiment.\nWoit begins the story of strings with a cautionary tale: the sad fate of the fad known as ""particle democracy"" that overtook the theory world in the 1960s. The hope it offered - as later did string theory - was that the mere structure of certain equations would lead to a unique theory of the world. The dream lives on in the minds of a few adherents and in a couple of books still popular among New Agers. It was in the course of fumbling around with this mathematics that the defining ideas of string theory emerged and eventually began to catch the fertile imaginations of the particle-theory community.\nThe main ideas behind string theory are these. First, that what we had been treating as particles (or fields defined at space-time points) are not that, but are little wiggly strings that define a surface in space-time as they move. Second, that (for reasons related to working out a consistent theory of these objects) space is really at least ten-dimensional, with most of the dimensions curled up so tightly we cannot see them. Third, that, by similar logic, the underlying symmetry of space-time must be supersymmetry, a generalisation of the ordinary relativistic symmetry that requires, among other things, that for every fermion there must be a corresponding boson (in strict supersymmetry, of the same mass) and vice versa, since the generators of the supersymmetry group switch the two. Hence, super strings.\nI need hardly say that none of these ideas has any experimental basis. So why then are they taken seriously? Perhaps there are several reasons - reasons that do not include the possibility, or even the hope, of experimental confirmation.\nAt the outset, the main task was perceived as being to bring general relativity into the fold, a task at which ordinary quantum field theory has always failed. With this visionary postulate, it did seem possible to make a reasonable supergravity - in ten supersymmetric dimensions, of course.\nClassical gravity is satisfactory all the way down to the ""Planck"" scale, 10¹5 smaller than we can at present measure, so we can imagine - and the string theorists do imagine - that all kinds of strange things, such as the disappearance of the extra dimensions and the breaking of supersymmetry, happen at the intermediate scales.\nGravity has always had a very special cachet among mathematically inclined theorists because of its gorgeous mathematical expression, accompanied by the myth that it sprang full blown from Einstein\'s brain (which it did not; he saw its outlines already in 1907 as a consequence of experimental arguments and spent eight years learning the maths to do it right). Even though we now know that there are other ways to converge gravity, one may nonetheless concede that it was a useful exercise to create an example of a theory that does not fail at the Planck scale.\nTo my mind, the most valid point in favour of string theory is that the standard model exhibits several ""internal local symmetries"". These receive a natural interpretation in string theory as rotations in the extra dimensions - an idea that dates back to Einstein\'s time.\nI am far less sympathetic to a line of thinking in the theory that seems to be purely aesthetic. String theory (in some one of its many versions) has actually been justified as ""just too beautiful not to be true"". Woit is particularly dismissive of this claim, suggesting that intricacy, abstruseness and novelty are no substitutes for the simplicity of, for instance, the standard model. There is doubtless a fascination and excitement in being in possession of a particularly esoteric and complex body of knowledge or ritual. String theory has begun to seem an obsession, even a cult - the kind of thing that leads the young to wear T-shirts with slogans such as ""Why be stuck with only four dimensions?""\nThe leading source of optimism, however, was the dream that superstrings would furnish a unique theory because of the constraints found on usable versions of the ideas. It is this dream that has evaporated as the mathematical understanding has increased - in fact, to the point that string theorists have come to accept that there are almost no uniqueness properties at all. In other words, one may have whatever universe one pleases. It may be said that there is so much freedom in string theory that our present universe, even at the elementary particle level, would be the result of historical contingency.\nFinally, Woit points out, a motivation for pursuing superstrings is often quoted as ""it\'s the only game in town"". The implication is that if you want a job in theoretical physics or a position at a prestigious institute, or even a MacArthur genius award, you had better learn string theory. Woit notes that with string theory, physicists are getting perilously close to validating the thesis of radical sociologists of science that at least this portion of science is socially constructed.\nIt is time to sum up. What is Woit\'s argument? He is not accusing the string theorists of egregious mathematical error - of course they are superb mathematicians. Rather, he accuses them simply of doing pure mathematics in physics departments, of redefining ""science"". One could not possibly object to the existence of an active mathematical community pursuing such an exciting, original line of work. The objection is to the claim that this work is physics, that it possibly, or even probably, will tell us how the real world constructs itself. One may particularly cavil at the high level of hype around string theory, to the point of monopolising popular attention, and that the gigadollars of a number of philanthropists, as well as numerous physics department employment slots, are being farmed out to what is really an esoteric branch of algebraic geometry.\nNot Even Wrong is written for the mathematically inclined. Woit seems to feel that it is essential for this very complex subject to be covered in a serious manner. The maths in the book may have been a mistake. It will open him to nitpicking on every issue he discusses and perhaps obscure the central issue, which may not be so very complicated: just what is the emperor actually wearing? He writes the non-mathematical parts of the book well and clearly, although not always without attitude. Still, as a solid-state theoretical physicist, I am pleased the book has been written and to have had the opportunity to speak my mind about its subject.\nPhilip W. Anderson is emeritus professor of physics, Princeton University, New Jersey, US.

60	french philosophers during ww2 timeline activities	During World War II, their paths diverged. Sartre entered the army as a meteorologist in 1939, was taken prisoner by German forces in 1940, and regained freedom in March 1941. He returned to Paris in April 1941. Meanwhile, Camus was in Paris when the Germans invaded France in 1940. He attempted to flee but ultimately joined the French Resistance, where he served as editor-in-chief of Combat, an outlawed newspaper.

This list of famous Algerian Writers is sorted by HPI (Historical Popularity Index), a metric that aggregates information on a biography’s online popularity. Visit the rankings page to view the entire list of Algerian Writers.\nWith an HPI of 88.59, Albert Camus is the most famous Algerian Writer. His biography has been translated into 125 different languages on wikipedia.\nAlbert Camus ( kam-OO, US also kə-MOO; French: [albɛʁ kamy] (listen); 7 November 1913 – 4 January 1960) was an Algerian-born French philosopher, author, dramatist and journalist. He was awarded the 1957 Nobel Prize in Literature at the age of 44, the second-youngest recipient in history. His works include The Stranger, The Plague, The Myth of Sisyphus, The Fall, and The Rebel. Camus was born in French Algeria to Pieds Noirs parents. He spent his childhood in a poor neighbourhood and later studied philosophy at the University of Algiers. He was in Paris when the Germans invaded France during World War II in 1940. Camus tried to flee but finally joined the French Resistance where he served as editor-in-chief at Combat, an outlawed newspaper. After the war, he was a celebrity figure and gave many lectures around the world. He married twice but had many extramarital affairs. Camus was politically active; he was part of the left that opposed the Soviet Union because of its totalitarianism. Camus was a moralist and leaned towards anarcho-syndicalism. He was part of many organisations seeking European integration. During the Algerian War (1954–1962), he kept a neutral stance, advocating for a multicultural and pluralistic Algeria, a position that caused controversy and was rejected by most parties. Philosophically, Camus\'s views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as absurdism. Some consider Camus\' work to show him to be an existentialist, even though he himself firmly rejected the term throughout his lifetime.\nWith an HPI of 81.01, Apuleius is the 2nd most famous Algerian Writer. His biography has been translated into 61 different languages.\nApuleius (; also called Lucius Apuleius Madaurensis; c. 124 – after 170) was a Numidian Latin-language prose writer, Platonist philosopher and rhetorician. He lived in the Roman province of Numidia, in the Berber city of Madauros, modern-day M\'Daourouch, Algeria. He studied Platonism in Athens, travelled to Italy, Asia Minor, and Egypt, and was an initiate in several cults or mysteries. The most famous incident in his life was when he was accused of using magic to gain the attentions (and fortune) of a wealthy widow. He declaimed and then distributed his own defense before the proconsul and a court of magistrates convened in Sabratha, near ancient Tripoli, Libya. This is known as the Apologia. His most famous work is his bawdy picaresque novel, the Metamorphoses, otherwise known as The Golden Ass. It is the only Latin novel that has survived in its entirety. It relates the adventures of its protagonist, Lucius, who experiments with magic and is accidentally turned into a donkey. Lucius goes through various adventures before he is turned back into a human being by the goddess Isis.\nWith an HPI of 70.30, Marcus Minucius Felix is the 3rd most famous Algerian Writer. His biography has been translated into 26 different languages.\nMarcus Minucius Felix (died c. 250 AD in Rome) was one of the earliest of the Latin apologists for Christianity. Nothing is known of his personal history, and even the date at which he wrote can be only approximately ascertained as between AD 150 and 270. Jerome\'s De Viris Illustribus No. 58 speaks of him as ""Romae insignis causidicus"" [one of Rome\'s notable solicitors], but in that he is probably only improving on the expression of Lactantius who speaks of him as ""non-ignobilis inter causidicos loci"" [not unknown among solicitors].\nWith an HPI of 69.92, Assia Djebar is the 4th most famous Algerian Writer. Her biography has been translated into 42 different languages.\nFatima-Zohra Imalayen (30 June 1936 – 6 February 2015), known by her pen name Assia Djebar (Arabic: آسيا جبار), was an Algerian novelist, translator and filmmaker. Most of her works deal with obstacles faced by women, and she is noted for her feminist stance. She is ""frequently associated with women\'s writing movements, her novels are clearly focused on the creation of a genealogy of Algerian women, and her political stance is virulently anti-patriarchal as much as it is anti-colonial."" Djebar is considered to be one of North Africa\'s pre-eminent and most influential writers. She was elected to the Académie française on 16 June 2005, the first writer from the Maghreb to achieve such recognition. For the entire body of her work she was awarded the 1996 Neustadt International Prize for Literature. She was often named as a contender for the Nobel Prize for Literature.\nWith an HPI of 69.89, Bernard-Henri Lévy is the 5th most famous Algerian Writer. His biography has been translated into 37 different languages.\nBernard-Henri Lévy (; French: [bɛʁnaʁ ɑ̃ʁi levi]; born 5 November 1948) is a French public intellectual. Often referred to in France simply as BHL, he was one of the leaders of the ""Nouveaux Philosophes"" (New Philosophers) movement in 1976. His opinions, political activism and publications have also been the subject of several controversies over the years.\nWith an HPI of 69.76, Robert Merle is the 6th most famous Algerian Writer. His biography has been translated into 29 different languages.\nRobert Merle (French: [mɛʁl]; 28 August 1908 – 27 March 2004) was a French novelist.\nWith an HPI of 67.33, Hélène Cixous is the 7th most famous Algerian Writer. Her biography has been translated into 30 different languages.\nHélène Cixous (; French: [siksu]; born 5 June 1937, Oran, Algeria) is a professor, French feminist writer, poet, playwright, philosopher, literary critic and rhetorician. Cixous is best known for her article ""The Laugh of the Medusa"", which established her as one of the early thinkers in post-structural feminism. She founded the first centre of feminist studies at a European university at the Centre universitaire de Vincennes of the University of Paris (today\'s University of Paris VIII).\nWith an HPI of 66.44, Kateb Yacine is the 8th most famous Algerian Writer. His biography has been translated into 25 different languages.\nKateb Yacine (Arabic pronunciation: [kæːtb jæːsiːn]; 2 August 1929 or 6 August 1929 – 28 October 1989) was an Algerian writer notable for his novels and plays, both in French and Algerian Arabic, and his advocacy of the Berber cause.\nWith an HPI of 65.01, Mohammed Dib is the 9th most famous Algerian Writer. His biography has been translated into 23 different languages.\nMohammed Dib (Arabic: محمد ديب; 21 July 1920 – 2 May 2003) was an Algerian author. He wrote over 30 novels, as well as numerous short stories, poems, and children\'s literature in the French language. He is probably Algeria\'s most prolific and well-known writer. His work covers the breadth of 20th century Algerian history, focusing on Algeria\'s fight for independence.\nWith an HPI of 65.01, Isaac Alfasi is the 10th most famous Algerian Writer. His biography has been translated into 18 different languages.\nIsaac ben Jacob Alfasi ha-Cohen (1013–1103) (Hebrew: ר\' יצחק אלפסי, Arabic: إسحاق الفاسي) - also known as the Alfasi or by his Hebrew acronym Rif (Rabbi Isaac al-Fasi), was a Maghrebi Talmudist and posek (decider in matters of halakha - Jewish law). He is best known for his work of halakha, the legal code Sefer Ha-halachot, considered the first fundamental work in halakhic literature. His name ""Alfasi"" means ""of Fez"" in Arabic, but opinions differ as to whether he ever lived in Fez.\nPantheon has 19 people classified as writers born between 110 and 1955. Of these 19, 4 (21.05%) of them are still alive today. The most famous living writers include Bernard-Henri Lévy, Hélène Cixous, and Yasmina Khadra. The most famous deceased writers include Albert Camus, Apuleius, and Marcus Minucius Felix.

61	What is the connection between the ancient Roman calendar and modern month names, and how does this relate to religious festivals in different faiths today?	The modern Gregorian calendar's month names come directly from the ancient Roman Julian calendar, with months like July and August named after Julius Caesar and Emperor Augustus, while September through December were named for their original numerical positions. Today, these same calendar months are used to mark various religious observances - Christian festivals like Easter follow the lunar calendar and are movable, while others like Christmas are fixed to specific Gregorian calendar dates. Similarly, Hindu festivals combine both lunar and solar observations, with celebrations like Holi occurring on the full moon of the eleventh month while other holidays align with solstices.	"['A calendar is a system for dividing time over extended periods, such as days, months, or years. People have kept track of the days by the march of daylight and darkness and of the changing seasons in order to know when to plant crops and to get ready for winter. Sometimes they kept the record by notching a stick or knotting a cord once every day. They also watched the changing positions of the Sun and stars, the changes of the Moon, and the habits of plants and animals. The making of an exact calendar, however, has perplexed humankind for ages because the natural divisions of time by days (Earth cycle), months (lunar cycle), and years (solar cycle) do not fit together perfectly.\nThe Sumerians of Babylonia were probably the first people to make a calendar. They used the phases of the Moon, counting 12 lunar months as a year. To make up for the difference between this year and the solar year of the seasons, they inserted an extra month in the calendar about every four years. The early Egyptians, Greeks, and Semitic peoples copied this calendar. Later the Egyptians worked out a calendar that corresponded almost exactly to the seasons.\nThe early Romans also used a calendar that was based on the Moon. The year in this calendar was 355 days long. The months corresponding to March, May, July, and October each had 31 days; February had 28 days; and the rest had 29. An extra month was added about every fourth year.\nThe high priest regulated the calendar. On the calends, or day of the new moon, he announced to the people the times of the nones (first quarter) and ides (full moon) for that month. The word calendar is from the Latin word kalendae.\nThe priests, however, performed their calendar-keeping duties poorly, and by Julius Caesar’s time they had summer months coming in the spring. Caesar corrected this situation in 46 bc in the Julian calendar. He adopted the plan of the Egyptian astronomer Sosigenes—a 365-day solar year, with one day added every fourth, or “leap,” year. He distributed the extra 10 days among the 29-day months. The month lengths he established are still used today in the most widely adopted calendar.\nThe month Quintilis was renamed July for Julius Caesar. Later Sextilis was renamed August in honor of Emperor Augustus. An old story tells how Emperor Augustus changed the number of days in his month from 30 to 31 so that it would be as long as Caesar’s. The story probably has no basis in fact.\nJulius Caesar’s correction of one day in four years (1/4 day, or six hours, a year) made the calendar year slightly longer than the year of the seasons. Thus anniversaries began coming earlier and earlier in the year. In 1582 the vernal equinox, or beginning of spring, occurred on March 11 instead of the original date, March 21.\nPope Gregory XIII remedied this by directing that 10 days be dropped from the calendar and that the day after Thursday, Oct. 4, 1582, should be Friday, October 15. He also directed that a century year is a leap year only if it is divisible by 400. Therefore, 1600 and 2000 were leap years but 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not.\nThe new calendar was called the Gregorian, or New Style (N.S.), calendar. It was adopted by Roman Catholic countries, but Protestant and Eastern Orthodox countries long continued to use the Old Style (O.S.), or Julian, calendar. The new calendar was not adopted in England until 1752, when it was necessary to drop 11 days. The Eastern Orthodox church accepted the New Style in 1923, when 13 days were “lost.” The Chinese had adopted it in 1912.\nAnother reform that the Gregorian calendar effected was general adoption of January 1 as the beginning of the year. Until then some countries began it with December 25, others with January 1 or March 25 (as England did before 1752).\nThere are several very old calendar systems still in use. Three of the most prominent are the Jewish, Muslim, and Chinese. Both the Jewish and Chinese calendars are lunisolar: the years are reckoned according to the Sun but the months according to the Moon. The Muslim calendar is lunar.\nThe Jewish calendar supposes the world was created in what is 3761 bc on the Gregorian calendar. There is no designation of bc or ad as there is in the Gregorian calendar. Because the solar year exceeds 12 lunar months by about 11 days, a 13th month of 30 days is intercalated, or inserted, seven times in each 19-year cycle. This procedure follows the ancient Babylonian tradition with which ancient Israel was familiar. Other adjustments to the calendar are required periodically to make sure that the festival of Passover follows the first day of spring.\nChristianity, for most of its major festivals, adheres to the Jewish lunar calendar. Therefore, many of its feasts are movable—they do not occur on the same day each year in the Gregorian calendar. The chief holiday, Easter, always falls on the first Sunday following the full moon that falls on or after the vernal equinox. Therefore, most of the church year, including the pre-Easter season of Lent, is always adjusted to the date of Easter. Other festivals, such as Christmas and New Year, are fixed, occurring on specific dates in the Gregorian calendar.\nThe Chinese calendar is basically lunar, consisting of 12 months of alternately 29 and 30 days. This lunar year totals 354 days. To keep this calendar in step with the solar year of about 365 days, intercalary months are periodically inserted in much the same way they are in the Jewish calendar. One interesting feature of the Chinese calendar is the naming of the years. From ancient times 12 animal names have been attached to years. These names, in order of their occurrence, are rat, ox, tiger, hare, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, fowl, dog, and pig. This cycle of years is frequently used for astrological purposes, much the same way the 12 signs of the zodiac are used in the West to describe personality traits and to tell fortunes. Although the Gregorian calender is used today in China for administrative and business purposes, the Chinese calendar is still used for marking traditional festivals and agricultural cycles.\nIslam’s year is entirely lunar, following directives from its holy book, the Koran. The lunar cycles are considered guides for the faithful in their religious observances. The Islamic year has 12 months with, alternately, 29 and 30 days, making a year of 354 or 355 days. Because there is no attempt to align this lunar year with the solar year, Muslim months have no relation to the seasons. The months continually move around the year, so major festival observances may, therefore, occur in any season.\nAmong the Indians who lived in the Western Hemisphere before the arrival of Christopher Columbus, the most complex calendars were those developed by the Maya and Aztec peoples.\nThe basic structure of the Maya calendar is common to all calendars of ancient Mexico and Central America. It consisted of a ritual cycle of 260 named days and a year of 365 days. These cycles, which ran concurrently, formed a longer cycle of 18,980 days, or 52 years of 365 days. Called a “calendar round,” a designated day occurred at the end of the cycle in the same position. The 365-day year was divided into 18 months of 20 days each, with five “days of evil omen” added to fill out the years.\nThe calendar of the Aztec people was based on earlier calendars of the Valley of Mexico and was similar to the Mayan calendar. It had a ritual cycle as well as a year of 365 days. But the Aztec and Mayan years did not necessarily coincide with one another. The Aztec also had 18 months of 20 days, plus the five extra days to complete the year. These years were also considered to form a 52-year cycle. The year served to fix the time of festivals, which occurred at the end of each month.\nVery little is known about the calendar used by the Inca of Peru. Some scholars have even said they had no calendar. But most historians believe that the Inca had a calendar based on observations of both Sun and Moon. Names of 12 lunar months are recorded as well as their association with festivals in the agricultural cycle. Work seems to have been organized on the basis of a nine-day week. Three nine-day weeks, or 27 days, is the approximate time between new moons. Every third year was made up of 13 moons, with the others having 12. This formed a cycle of 37 moons, and 20 of these cycles made a period of 60 years.\nNative American tribes north of Mexico did not have true calendars, or integrated systems for indicating days and longer periods of time. Usually intervals of time—days, months, and years—were counted independently of one another. The day was a basic unit recognized by all tribes, but there is no record of any names for the days. Longer periods of time were counted by moons, which began with the new moon or conjunction of the Moon and the Sun. Years were divided into four seasons. Among settled agricultural tribes, the cycle of seasons was significant, but the beginning time of the year varied. For some it was observed at the vernal equinox, the start of spring. The Hopi Indians of Arizona celebrated the new year, which they called the new-fire ceremony, in November, while the Creek Indians’ ceremony was in late July or early August.\nA true year, as opposed to a calendar year, may be defined as the time Earth takes to return to the same point on its orbit around the Sun. But there are several ways of defining the “same point.” Astronomers therefore recognize different kinds of year.\nThe simplest reference point is one on Earth’s orbit in which Earth aligns with the Sun and a particular star. Such a point is fixed: It remains the same century after century. The year measured between two successive crossings of such a point is called the sidereal year, from the Latin word sidus, meaning “star,” or “planet.” It is 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes, and 9.5 seconds long.\nAnother reference is a point on Earth’s orbit where Earth’s axis is perpendicular, or at a right angle, to a line from the Sun. This occurs twice a year, in the spring and fall. A year measured between successive crossings of one of these points is called the tropical year. Its duration is 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 46 seconds. The seasons keep in step with the tropical year because both are based on the position of Earth’s axis. For that reason the solar calendar year is based on the tropical year.\nStill another astronomical reference point is the perihelion, the point on Earth’s orbit where Earth is closest to the Sun. The time between crossings of this point is called the anomalistic year. Because the perihelion is moving slowly in the same direction Earth travels on its orbit, the anomalistic year is the longest of the three types. Its duration is 365 days, 6 hours, 13 minutes, and 53 seconds.\nThe word month is derived from the Old English word for moon. A month was originally the time between two new moons. Today astronomers refer to this period of time as a lunar month. Its average length is 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 2.8 seconds. The Moon travels around Earth in 27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes, and 11.5 seconds. This is the sidereal month. Calendar months usually differ in length, and all except February are longer than 29 days in order to accommodate the solar year, which is almost 11 days longer than a lunar year.\nThe names for the months in the present Gregorian calendar are taken from the ancient Roman months of the Julian calendar. January is derived from Janus, a household god of beginnings. He was often depicted facing in two directions. February was the time of a feast of purification called Februa. March was named after Mars, the god of war. April is of uncertain origin. It may be named after the Greek goddess Aphrodite. May is probably derived from the goddess Maia. June was named after the goddess Juno. July and August were named, respectively, after Julius Caesar and his successor, Augustus. The last four months got their names from their original numerical placement in the year. Septem, for instance, is Latin for “seven.”\nThe seven-day week, which has no astronomical basis, was apparently first observed in Mesopotamia. It was introduced to Rome in the 1st century ad by Persian astrologers who associated each day with a different planet, but most Romans continued to use an eight-day week. When Christianity became the official religion of Rome in the 4th century, the seven-day week was adopted by the state and spread throughout the Roman Empire. The days were named after the then known seven planets: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun (not distinguished from a planet at the time), Venus, Mercury, and the Moon (also considered a planet). The names of days in Latin countries still point to these origins, as do Sunday, Monday, and Saturday in English. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, however, are named after the Scandinavian gods Tiw, Woden, Thor, and Frigga.', 'Mathematics and Mysticism\nIn his video Dr. Neiman explains how the Babylonian calendar influenced the Jewish lunar calendar. Because Islam is an Abrahamic religion, it’s safe to assume that their lunar calendar was also influenced by the same source. The same could be said for the early Christians who observed a lunar calendar before following the Julian solar calendar, adopted from the Egyptians and mandated by Julius Caesar in 46–45 BCE. However, this calendar drifted out of sync with the vernal equinox observed on the day of Christ’s resurrection. This was fixed in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII, who established the lunar-solar Gregorian calendar that we observe globally today.\nThe Jewish Tora and Star of David.\nImage of Christ on a stained glass window,\nPhotograph of the Islamic shrine, the Dome of the Rock, in Jerusalem.\nLike the Jewish calendar, Buddhist traditions follow one as well. They also share an intercalary 13th month that they must add to align with the seasons. Just last Wednesday was Vesak or Buddha Day observed on a full moon, which celebrates the birth, enlightenment, and death of Gautama Buddha. It is interesting that the Islamic calendar does not observe seasons, enabling it to keep 12 months in a year with 29.53 days of a lunar cycle enjoying the seasons to drift back into what they were before every 30 years.\nPainting of the birth of Gautama Buddha.\nThe Hindu calendar, like the Gregorian calendar is lunisolar, observing important holidays on the cycles of both the moon and the sun. The famous Festival or Color or Holi is celebrated on the full moon of the 11th month of the year while other holidays are observed on the winter and summer solstices.\nHoli is a spring festival of colors.

In fact, the Hindu and Buddhist belief that the universe is billions of year old and that there are different realms of existence seems to correspond with modern scientific theories of the Big Bang and, based on certain interpretations of quantum mechanics, the possibility of parallel or alternate universes.\nSchrödinger\'s Cat, many worlds interpretation, with universe branching.

62	modern factory provide worker safety and productivity	The Fagus factory in 1911 was revolutionary in prioritizing worker safety and comfort with bright, airy spaces and accident prevention features, resulting in below-average accident rates. Modern workplace research shows that good ergonomics, proper training, and consideration of privacy needs are essential for both safety and productivity. Well-designed workplaces with proper lighting, ergonomic equipment, and spaces that minimize interruptions help protect workers' health while allowing them to focus on high-priority tasks.	['The Fagus factory is considered a key work in modern architecture. The building complex (1911–1925, 1938) designed by the architect Walter Gropius in Alfeld, Lower Saxony, for a shoe manufacturer, with its steel and glass construction, became a signpost of later Bauhaus architecture.\nFagus factory in Alfeld: facts\n|Official title:||Fagus factory in Alfeld|\n|Cultural monument:||First industrial building of the modern age, built by Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer from 1911 in the Bauhaus style factory complex with ten buildings for the production of shoe lasts in Alfeld, Lower Saxony; fundamental break with the industrial architecture of the time due to large glass surfaces and functional aesthetics for the factory that is still in operation today; Light-flooded, light-weight construction made of steel and glass in a skeleton construction (“curtain wall”) with pillarless, fully glazed corners|\n|Location:||Alfeld, Lower Saxony|\n|Meaning:||Milestone of functional industrial design with groundbreaking elements for the aesthetics of buildings in the 20th century; outstanding contribution to the humanization of industrial working life and groundbreaking aesthetic manifestation of the social changes of the industrial age; remarkable exchange between generations of architects from Germany, Europe and North America according to computergees|\nModernity in the field of industrial architecture began not in a global metropolis, but in the province of Lower Saxony. From 1911 Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer set up a factory for shoe lasts in Alfeld an der Leine. With the Fagus factory, they created the original revolutionary building of the “New Building”.\nCarl Benscheidt (* 1858, † 1947) imagined his new, “ideally designed” factory to be accident-proof and with a pleasant atmosphere. An airy, bright environment should protect the health of the employees and offer them the best conditions for quality work. For the tough working world of 1911, these were revolutionary ideas that the manufacturer wanted to implement in his shoe lasts factory. Benscheidt also wanted to organize the production process of the lasts, which corresponded to the latest orthopedic findings, according to the rational methods of modern industrial production that he had got to know in the USA. The beech trees – Latin fagus – provided the name and raw material for the company- the forests in the vicinity of Alfeld an der Leine. In the 1970s, beech wood was replaced by plastic materials, but shoe lasts are still produced in the Fagus factory today.\nThe first constructive plans for the Fagus factory came from the Hanoverian architect Eduard Werner. According to the company chronicle, the application for Werner’s building had already been submitted and the excavation work had already started when Carl Benscheidt commissioned two young architects from Berlin in 1911 to redesign the outer skin of the factory building: Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer (* 1881, † 1929). Gropius, then almost 28 years old, and thirty-year-old Meyer had only recently set up an architecture firm in Berlin. The expansion of the Fagus factory was her first major contract – and it was to write architectural history.\nIt was not by chance that Benscheidt came across the two young architects. Gropius had found out about the planned new building from his brother-in-law Max Burchard, who lived in Alfeld. In his application letter written in December 1910 “for the imminent grand new building”, he used the district administrator as a reference. The building owner’s specifications met with open ears with the Berlin architects, as Gropius had demanded in a lecture in Hagen in January 1911 on the social and aesthetic task of industrial architecture: “Work must be built with palaces for the factory worker, the slave of modern architecture Industrial work, not just giving light, air and cleanliness, but also letting him feel something of the dignity of the common great idea that drives the whole thing. “Also the” subtly calculating master of the factory “,\nGropius and Meyer took over Werner’s floor plan, but rejected the Wilhelminian style facade on the main building that he had planned in favor of a glass facade – according to Gropius a “radical solution” that met with astonishment from the local building police and was only approved without compromise thanks to Benscheidt’s support.\nFor his part, Benscheidt recognized early on the effective advertising potential that was contained in what he considered to be the “exemplary building” by Gropius and Meyer. The plant, located directly on the railway line between Hanover and Kassel, offered a bold contrast to the historicizing architecture of the time and, he hoped, would provide spectacular advertising.\nThe production hall, which is still used for production today, was also designed in an innovative manner. Here the light falls through the two-thirds glazed front to the street and from the other side through the large windows in the “saw teeth” of the shed roof. This creates a bright, pleasant atmosphere – and, as Carl Benscheidt had wished, contributes to the safety of the workers: the accident rate in the Fagus plant was well below the average for comparable companies from the start.\nToday the Fagus factory is considered a milestone in architectural history; it has been a listed building since 1946. In 2011 it was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Site as the key building of modernity.', 'We all want it: Workplaces that are comfortable, inviting, and safe, and that allow us all to work more efficiently. Countless articles have been written about this search, and manufacturers around the globe promise the answer to our quest. But exactly how do you create commercial facilities that are high performance – that allow end-users to be their best?\n“When it comes to ergonomics, I have seen that there is in company after company a heightened awareness from the health and safety groups as well as risk managers and they are influencing the facilities managers a lot,” says Noe Palacios, manager of User Center Design Group, Steelcase Inc., Grand Rapids, MI. Specializing in ergonomics, Palacios has extensive experience in research and development, engineering, and product marketing and has worked closely with facilities managers for 20 years. Among facilities managers, interest in ergonomics continues; the confusion lies in the best way of using the principles of ergonomics to achieve outstanding facilities.\nAccording to Palacios, most workplace injuries are musculoskeletal disorders occurring in the upper body (i.e., repeated stress injuries in the wrist or neck), caused by constant exposure to risk factors. Such factors in commercial facilities include forceful exertions, awkward postures, contact stress, and repetition. Adds Palacios, “We all want a high-performance workplace, but we want to make sure that everything fits together as a system to support the individual.”\nTraining is the missing ingredient.\nPalacios believes that education and training programs lie at the heart of achieving workplaces that truly work. “I find that to be one of the top keys to whether the solution is successful or not,” says Palacios. He recommends that organizations develop ergonomic committees to give employees the information they need and to ensure that information is being updated. “If the company has a philosophy or a point of view on that, those companies do very well because that filters all the way down,” explains Palacios.\nA crucial time to educate employees is for new hires and when people switch duties or change workstations. For example, when a call center recently changed from traditional closed office spaces to new open workstations, Palacios helped the company develop a new work protocol so employees could take advantage of the increased ability to communicate in open office plans without disturbing each other.\nMore than just concentrating on end-users’ body measurements and product aesthetics, Palacios urges facilities and design professionals to consider ease of use and a product’s intuitiveness – controls should be easy to understand and adjust.\nConsider the complete environment.\nNowadays it is not uncommon to have four unique groups of workers – mature, baby boomers, Generation X, and Generation Y – sharing the work environment. Each age group has unique considerations. For example, older employees might have bifocals and need specific light requirements for optimal working conditions. Palacios encourages facilities professionals to examine their employees, the tasks the employees need to accomplish, and the computer equipment, and adapt the space to fit the task. A good example: Often employees who use laptops for extended periods are more comfortable with an external keyboard or monitor.\nTo create high-performance workplaces, Palacios believes facilities managers have to consider the physical and the psychosocial needs of their end-users, meaning consider the optimal physical requirements and examine corporate culture so that employees feel comfortable. Palacios is a strong advocate of the benefits that a well-designed office can bring. Adds Palacios, “It impacts productivity and the well-being of the individual, so training is very critical. It is not hype; it is real.”\n“People don’t lose time. In a very broad sense, people are not able to spend as much time on their high-priority items as their low-priority items; the lower priority items are taking up their time,” says Mark Ellwood, president, Pace Productivity, Toronto. For the past 13 years, Ellwood has helped the employees of large corporations track the time they spend on various activities, analyze the results, and create efficiency reports; he also provides recommendations and training.\nLack of administrative support.\nAlthough each organization he has worked on is unique, Ellwood believes many times the reasons employees are less productive are similar. The main reason includes simply spending too much time on administrative jobs and secondary tasks, such as meetings and paperwork, instead of primary functions. “No one is wasting time, but their time is being misdirected toward administrative tasks vs. high-priority ones. Now why is that happening?” asks Ellwood.\nAccording to Ellwood, many companies have downsized secretaries and administrative assistants and expected technology to replace these important jobs. This trend has lead to delegating time-consuming administrative tasks to management. “Successful organizations find a way to leverage their people so they are not doing a lot of clerical stuff,” says Ellwood.\nRecognize the positive and negative impact of technology.\nFax machines, printers, cell phones, PCs, high-speed Internet access: Technology has, of course, done wonders to improve communication and workflow. However, with good often comes bad. Malfunctioning technology, or during the training process for new software or equipment, can slow productivity. Adds Ellwood, “Technology creates its own spin-off side effects; we have to do a lot more things. We have to upgrade to the new computer system, learn how to forward calls on the new answering system, buy batteries for a cell phone, and on and on. If your computer breaks down, it is the end of the world.”\nAlthough we all seem busier, Ellwood believes our productivity is dropping due to interruptions from technology issues. He helps employees reduce their glut of e-mails and time wasted on rambling cell phone conversations. “People are struggling with how they can be more productive and it is not about buying more technology; it is about doing things smarter,” he explains.\nRemember the need for privacy.\nWhen it comes to the physical space, employees’ productivity is most impacted by interruptions from coworkers, according to research from Pace Productivity. “I believe, to a large degree, that is a function of the physical space. If you make it easy for people to interrupt, they will,” says Ellwood. He asks facilities and design professionals to consider the end-users’ need for privacy and create the best space for the task – not merely the most cost effective.\nOften in Ellwood’s work he comes across individuals who feel overwhelmed by external forces. He strives to help employees achieve a sense of control. Instead of suffering through long meetings, for instance, Ellwood instructs clients how to give input and keep meetings on track. He adds, “I am trying to empower people to do things that they didn’t think they could do.”\n“We are on the front line dealing with employees and their management. Often there isn’t consideration for the human factors in terms of the human interface in that space, in terms of what the tasks are, what the space is, what the equipment is,” says John Stevenson, Ph.D., PT, CEA, associate professor of Physical Therapy, Grand Valley State University, Grand Rapids, MI. As a clinician and ergonomist, Stevenson has devoted years of study to the human movement potential, both normal and pathological, and to working with facilities managers to eradicate risk factors in workplaces.\nCurrently, Stevenson is working with San Diego-based Active Input on its new keyboard support system, which features continuous passive motion (CPM), specifically studying the device’s effect on hand blood flow and wrist function. Stevenson has used CPM in orthopedic rehabilitation and is interested in its role as a preventive tool. The prospective case study work has been completed and a larger study will commence next year.\nConsider employees’ behavior.\nAs a clinician and ergonomist, Stevenson has a unique view of workplace injuries, believing that some ergonomists focus on all injuries as if they were workplace- related. He urges facilities professionals to analyze workplace risk factors, as well as bad movement behavior, on the part of employees. As a clinician, Stevenson frequently sees patients with poor alignment of the spine, shoulders, wrists, and hands, in addition to poor seating posture.\nStevenson believes the term ergonomics has become misused and overused. “It has become a trendy word, as opposed to a genuine application,” he states. He considers too many definitions have bled into the term, confusing the facilities management industry.\nResearch recent ergonomic data.\nNot enough evidence-based studies have been done in tracking specific interventions and their effectiveness, or in validating reductions in loss workdays or improved productivity. “They are difficult studies to do; that is one problem the field faces,” says Stevenson. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is an excellent source for ergonomic research results. Go to (www.cdc.gov/niosh/).\nEstablish an ergonomic committee.\n“I define good companies as being those that have active, committed ergonomic programs as part of their occupational health and safety programs for their employees,” says Stevenson. A proactive, highly visible ergonomic program not only educates the employees, but also lets them know their comforts and concerns matter. Good companies with high-performance workplaces, according to Stevenson, invest in it and value their employees.\nThese steps outline how to create a high-performance workplace, but it all boils down to how much you value your employees and their environment. “It takes a commitment from the top from the building owner,” says Stevenson.\nRegina Raiford (email@example.com) is senior editor at Buildings magazine.']	['<urn:uuid:45094738-7c0a-4c21-958a-67e72bf924d9>', '<urn:uuid:c1e06272-ed0e-4252-aaac-eab0954554eb>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	7	71	2407

These rooms never contain furniture and are designed for contemplation. The tea ceremony became an essential part of Japanese culture, particularly among the elite and samurai classes.

Concealed interior tungsten lighting is computer-controlled, cycling up and down, while daylight filters through the circular holes cut out of the laminated, honeycomb aluminium walls. Feeling that aluminium would be too hard a finish for the interior, Suzuki had panels made by sandwiching the honeycomb centre in traditionally-made rice paper. The combination of panels and walls is 10 cm thick, and when the exterior light dominates guests inside feel the space is slightly larger than when the interior lights are stronger.\nNew Zen by Michael Freeman\nNew Zen is a unique publication – a collection of the most innovative modern Japanese tea ceremony rooms, or chashitsu, designed by contemporary architects. The tea ceremony was established in Japan in the 15th century and became an essential part of Japanese culture for the elite Japanese, and in particular the samurai. Traditionally chashitsu are made up of certain elements (an alcove (tokonoma), with a flower and painted scroll, tatami mats, a sunken hearth (ro) and chashitsu windows), never contain furniture and are used for contemplation. In the last 15 years Japanese architects have been reinterpreting the tea ceremony room, creating modern meditative spaces. The result is that today these rooms and houses represent some of the most interesting and innovative interior design and architecture in Japan, featuring a vast array of materials, including paper, wood, plastic, aluminium and concrete.\nThe book begins with a fascinating introduction that explains the history of the tea ceremony, the function of the various elements of the tea ceremony room and the ritual of the ceremony itself. Following the introduction the book goes on to look at recent architectural projects that interpret the tea ceremony room in vastly different ways, from a tree house in the countryside in Nagano to a portable example in metal. Over 35 projects are brought together in a single volume for the first time, with examples by renowned Japanese architects such as Kengo Kuma, Terunobu Fujimori and Shigeru Uchida. With over 250 colour photographs by the renowned photographer Michael Freeman and a revealing text, this book will show this fascinating part of Japanese contemporary culture in a new light.\nMichael Freeman is an international photographer and writer based in London, who specializes in travel, architecture and Asian art. He has worked as either a photographer or writer on over 30 books, including The Modern Japanese Garden (Mitchell Beazley), Savouring India (Time Life Books), Oriental Style (Thames and Hudson) and The Spirit of Asia: Journeys to the Sacred Places of the East (Thames and Hudson).\n230 x 250 mm\nPosted by Rose Etherington\nSign up for a daily roundup\nof all our stories""]"	['<urn:uuid:f01c6b43-1a28-4338-ad81-3f058a9bf43f>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	8	59	695

FTP is built on a client-server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server.\nWhere is FTP protocol used?\nFTP is a widely used network protocol for transferring files between computers over a TCP/IP-based network, such as the Internet. FTP lets people and applications exchange and share data within their offices and across the Internet.', 'Managed file transfer (“MFT”) refers to software or a service that manages the secure transfer of data from one computer to another through a network (e.g., the Internet). MFT software is marketed to corporate enterprises as an alternative to using ad-hoc file transfer solutions, such as FTP, HTTP and others.\nTypically, MFT offers a higher level of security and control than FTP. Features include reporting (e.g., notification of successful file transfers), non-repudiation, auditability, global visibility, automation of file transfer-related activities and processes, end-to-end security, and performance metrics/monitoring.\nMFT applications are available as both on-premises licensed software packages and software-as-a-service (“SaaS”). Some are specially designed for enterprise use while others are for sale to individual consumers. A few enterprise-focused SaaS MFT providers also manage the additions of new trading partners, which can free up a lot of IT (information technology) resources.\nMFT refers to a class of product that manages, secures, centralizes, and automates the transfer of files inside and outside of an organization. There are numerous MFT vendors, including some that support i OS and run on the System i server.\nAt the core of an MFT solution is often an FTP server—or, more likely, an SFTP (uses SSH) or FTPS server (uses SSL) that provides encrypted file transfers. Many MFT solutions also include provisions for sending files via SMTP, HTTP, or HTTPS. Still others rely on proprietary file transfer protocols, and include separate compression and encryption capabilities.\nBut MFT is not merely a collection of FTP, SMTP, or HTTP servers. On top of the transport layer, MFT solutions produce and provide full audit trails showing who transferred what files to where, and how and when they did it. This adds security to basic file transfer activities, and gives MFT a hand in regulatory compliance.\nMFT also includes elements of automation, such as the capability to execute jobs when specific files arrive in specific folders, and to alert IT managers of unexpected situations. This allows MFT products to eliminate complicated scripting and reduce the need for expensive programming expertise.\nMFT also identifies and records successful and failed file transfers to a customer or a partner. This provides elements of non-repudiation, and can help prevent those embarrassing instances where an organization isn’t sure if a critical transfer actually worked.\nMFT applications are characterized by having all or most of the following features:\n- Support multiple file transfer protocols including FTP/S, OFTP, SFTP, SCP, AS2, and HTTP/S.\n- Securely transfer files over public and private networks using encrypted file transfer protocols.\n- Securely store files using multiple data encryption methods\n- Automate file transfer processes between trading partners and exchanges including detection and handling of failed file transfers.\n- Authenticate users against existing user repositories such as LDAP and Active Directory\n- Integrate to existing applications using documented APIs (application programming interfaces)\n- Generate detailed reports on user and file transfer activity.\nFrom its inception, FTP has made moving large volumes of bulk data between any two entities—including file servers, applications, and trading partners—possible. However, FTP (and other communication protocols such as HTTP and SMTP) do not, on their own, provide a way to secure or manage the payload or the transmission. Yet, regardless of the lack of security and management capabilities, many companies have continued to transport large batches of structured and unstructured data using these protocols.\nThis practice is changing, however. According to Gartner Research, “Organizations often use MFT solutions to replace FTP. This is due to increased focus on compliance, privacy regulations and corporate transparency — which demand increased auditing, management, security and process.”\nWhile Managed File Transfer always recovers the same features—reporting (e.g., notification of successful file transfers), non-repudiation, auditability, global visibility, automation of file transfer-related activities and processes, end-to-end security, and performance metrics/monitoring—the way it is used has a major impact on the nature of the appropriate solution. Today analysts and experts agree on 6 different usage patterns for MFT:\n- Ad Hoc\n- Accelerated Transfer or “Extreme” Transfer\n- A2A (Administrative-2-Administration)\nUsing a managed file transfer product can help your organization avoid data leak horror stories. You’ll gain the ability to restrict permissible senders and receivers, centrally log data transfers, securely encrypt your data, and integrate with data loss prevention products. Considering the business value delivered by MFT in conjunction with the answers to the four questions outlined above will help you determine whether MFT has a role in your enterprise.\nWould you like to know more about managed file transfer?

65	piston movement combustion chamber pressure calculation	Piston movement affects combustion chamber pressure in multiple ways. During compression, piston motion influences mixture density and flame rate. Using the compression ratio formula, pre-ignition cylinder pressure can be estimated by multiplying atmospheric pressure by the compression ratio raised to the power of gamma (approximately 1.4 for air). For example, with a 10:1 compression ratio, cylinder pressure at TDC would be about 180-200 psi. This pressure is affected by factors like valve timing, connecting rod length, and piston speed. Long connecting rods tend to increase cylinder pressure near TDC due to slower piston movement and longer residence time.	"['Connecting rods become virtual ""whips"" that mechanically join pistons to the crankshaft an\nYet another common location for rod failure is a portion sometimes called the ""hinge point,"" which is generally where a connecting rod\'s beam section changes in cross-section area (wide to narrow). Connecting rod designers frequently work in this area to determine the best compromises between rod strength and material selection. Of course, you should always include proper rod side-clearance, making certain not to provide excessive dimension that allows oil to create over-oiling of cylinder walls. Insufficient side-clearance can lead to over-heated and failed rod bearings, as well.\nFinally, if we assume that a piston represents the ""floor"" of an engine\'s combustion space, then the rate of piston movement and time spent at each crankshaft angle will affect the rate of change in combustion space (volume). Of the reasons this is important, one is that piston movement can affect mixture density during the compression stroke (and subsequent flame rate and rise of combustion pressure). This, in turn, bears influence on spark ignition timing and the optimization of IMEP (minimizing ""negative"" torque). During an exhaust cycle, piston motion can also affect efficient cylinder evacuation and, therefore, is linked to proper exhaust valve timing.\nJust considering these two peripherals of piston movement, we can immediately see that any changes to a piston\'s rate of travel may affect net cylinder pressure and power. Connecting rod length can, and does, influence cylinder pressure. Perhaps obscure is the fact that while longer connecting rods produce a larger included angle between rod axis and crank throw (stroke) at the same piston position and crank angle, it is piston motion approaching and leaving TDC and BDC that provides some interesting study.\nHere\'s an example of that. As connecting rod length is increased, piston motion (both acceleration and velocity) away from TDC decreases. This results in a slower rate of pressure drop across the inlet path, therefore causing a reduction in intake flow rate (all else being equal). Unless compensation is made for this change in piston speed, some degree of volumetric efficiency may be lost.\nIn contrast to this effect upon volumetric efficiency (potential torque), piston ""residence time"" at and near TDC during combustion tends to hasten flame rate, correspondingly raise cylinder pressure per unit time, and enhance the tendency toward detonation. Reduced initial (or total) ignition spark timing, applied to reduce pre-TDC cylinder pressure, also increases IMEP by the reduction of negative torque. Or it can work against the piston as it approaches TDC during combustion.\nLong rod combinations usually like intake manifold passages (actually heads and manifold) that help boost flow rates not provided by more rapidly descending pistons associated with shorter rods. So in addition to adjusting valve timing and lift patterns to match changes in piston speed needed to increase volumetric efficiency for increased rod length, port section areas and even carburetor sizing can be used to help restore reduced flow rates.\nThere is also the issue with reduced piston side-loading with long rod use. This reduction in friction horsepower has been attributed to power gains, especially when piston speed increases beyond about 2,500 feet/second. Improved ring life with long rods has also been claimed by some engine builders.\nSo while none of this month\'s Enginology was intended to advocate the use of short or long connecting rods, it emphasizes the importance of contemplating other engine functions that required consideration when making material changes to the rate of piston travel as a direct function of crankshaft angle. You will find that knowledgeable parts manufacturers, relative to the subject of connecting rod length, generally have a store of information linking how their components can affect an engine\'s ability to capitalize on rod length changes. If they don\'t, you may want to consider finding manufacturers who do. The concept of functional parts integration isn\'t without basis.', '- Compression ratio\nThe \'compression ratio\' of an internal-combustion engine or external combustion engine is a value that represents the ratio of the volume of its combustion chamber from its largest capacity to its smallest capacity. It is a fundamental specification for many common combustion engines.\nIn a piston engine it is the ratio between the volume of the cylinder and combustion chamber when the piston is at the bottom of its stroke, and the volume of the combustion chamber when the piston is at the top of its stroke.\nPicture a cylinder and its combustion chamber with the piston at the bottom of its stroke containing 1000 cc of air (900 cc in the cylinder plus 100 cc in the combustion chamber). When the piston has moved up to the top of its stroke inside the cylinder, and the remaining volume inside the head or combustion chamber has been reduced to 100 cc, then the compression ratio would be proportionally described as 1000:100, or with fractional reduction, a 10:1 compression ratio.\nA high compression ratio is desirable because it allows an engine to extract more mechanical energy from a given mass of air-fuel mixture due to its higher thermal efficiency. High ratios place the available oxygen and fuel molecules into a reduced space along with the adiabatic heat of compression–causing better mixing and evaporation of the fuel droplets. Thus they allow increased power at the moment of ignition and the extraction of more useful work from that power by expanding the hot gas to a greater degree.\nHigher compression ratios will however make gasoline engines subject to engine knocking if lower octane-rated fuel is used, also known as detonation. This can reduce efficiency or damage the engine if knock sensors are not present to retard the timing. However, knock sensors have been a requirement of the OBD-II specification used in 1996 model year vehicles and newer.\nDiesel engines on the other hand operate on the principle of compression ignition, so that a fuel which resists autoignition will cause late ignition which will also lead to engine knock.\n- 1 Formula\n- 2 Typical compression ratios\n- 3 Fault finding and diagnosis\n- 4 Variable Compression Ratio (VCR) engines\n- 5 Dynamic compression ratio\n- 6 Compression ratio versus overall pressure ratio\n- 7 See also\n- 8 Notes\n- 9 External links\nThe ratio is calculated by the following formula:\n- , where\n- = cylinder bore (diameter)\n- = piston stroke length\n- = clearance volume. It is the volume of the combustion chamber (including head gasket). This is the minimum volume of the space at the end of the compression stroke, i.e. when the piston reaches top dead center (TDC). Because of the complex shape of this space, it is usually measured directly rather than calculated.\nTypical compression ratios\nPetrol (gasoline) engine\nDue to pinging (detonation), the compression ratio in a gasoline or petrol-powered engine will usually not be much higher than 10:1, although some production automotive engines built for high-performance from 1955–1972 had compression ratios as high as 13.0:1, which could run safely on the high-octane leaded gasoline then available.\nA technique used to prevent the onset of knock is the high ""swirl"" engine that forces the intake charge to adopt a very fast circular rotation in the cylinder during compression that provides quicker and more complete combustion. Recently, with the addition of variable valve timing and knock sensors to delay ignition timing, it is possible to manufacture gasoline engines with compression ratios of over 11:1 that can use 87 (MON + RON)/2 (octane rating) fuel.\nIn engines with a \'ping\' or \'knock\' sensor and an electronic control unit, the CR can be as high as 13:1 (2005 BMW K1200S). In 1981, Jaguar released a cylinder head that allowed up to 14:1 compression; but settled for 12.5:1 in production cars. The cylinder head design was known as the ""May Fireball"" head; it was developed by a Swiss engineer Michael May.\nPetrol/gasoline engine with pressure-charging\nIn a turbocharged or supercharged gasoline engine, the CR is customarily built at 10.5:1 or lower. This is due to the turbocharger/supercharger already having compressed the fuel/air mixture considerably before it enters the cylinders.\nPetrol/gasoline engine for racing\nMotorcycle racing engines can use compression ratios as high as 14:1, and it is not uncommon to find motorcycles with compression ratios above 12.0:1 designed for 86 or 87 octane fuel. F1 engines come closer to 17:1 (which is very critical for maximizing volumetric/fuel efficiency at around 18000 rpm)\nEthanol and methanol engines\nIn an auto-ignition diesel engine, (no electrical sparking plug—the hot air of compression lights the injected fuel) the CR will customarily exceed 14:1. Ratios over 22:1 are common. The appropriate compression ratio depends on the design of the cylinder head. The figure is usually between 14:1 and 16:1 for direct injection engines and between 18:1 and 23:1 for indirect injection engines.\nFault finding and diagnosis\nMeasuring the compression pressure of an engine, with a pressure gauge connected to the spark plug opening, gives an indication of the engine\'s state and quality. There is, however, no formula to calculate compression ratio based on cylinder pressure.\nIf the nominal compression ratio of an engine is given, the pre-ignition cylinder pressure can be estimated using the following relationship:\nwhere is the cylinder pressure at bottom dead center which is usually at 1 atm, CR is the compression ratio, and is the specific heat ratio for the working fluid, which is about 1.4 for air, and 1.3 for methane-air mixture.\nFor example, if an engine running on gasoline has a compression ratio of 10:1, the cylinder pressure at top dead center is\nThis figure, however, will also depend on cam (i.e. valve) timing. Generally, cylinder pressure for common automotive designs should at least equal 10 bar, or, roughly estimated in pounds per square inch (psi) as between 15 and 20 times the compression ratio, or in this case between 150 psi and 200 psi, depending on cam timing. Purpose-built racing engines, stationary engines etc. will return figures outside this range.\nFactors including late intake valve closure (relatively speaking for camshaft profiles outside of typical production car range, but not necessarily into the realm of competition engines) can produce a misleadingly low figure from this test. Excessive connecting rod clearance, combined with extremely high oil pump output (rare but not impossible) can sling enough oil to coat the cylinder walls with enough oil to facilitate reasonable piston ring seal artificially give a misleadingly high figure, on engines with compromised ring seal.\nThis can actually be used to some slight advantage. If a compression test does give a low figure, and it has been determined it is not due to intake valve closure/camshaft characteristics, then one can differentiate between the cause being valve/seat seal issues and ring seal by squirting engine oil into the spark plug orifice, in a quantity sufficient to disperse across the piston crown and the circumference of the top ring land, and thereby effect the mentioned seal. If a second compression test is performed shortly thereafter, and the new reading is much higher, it would be the ring seal that is problematic, whereas if the compression test pressure observed remains low, it is a valve sealing (or more rarely head gasket, or breakthrough piston or rarer still cylinder wall damage) issue.\nIf there is a significant (greater than 10%) difference between cylinders, that may be an indication that valves or cylinder head gaskets are leaking, piston rings are worn or that the block is cracked.\nIf a problem is suspected then a more comprehensive test using a leak-down tester can locate the leak.\nVariable Compression Ratio (VCR) engines\nBecause cylinder bore diameter, piston stroke length and combustion chamber volume are almost always constant, the compression ratio for a given engine is almost always constant, until engine wear takes its toll.\nOne exception is the experimental Saab Variable Compression engine (SVC). This engine, designed by Saab Automobile, uses a technique that dynamically alters the volume of the combustion chamber (Vc), which, via the above equation, changes the compression ratio (CR).\nThe Atkinson cycle engine was one of the first attempts at variable compression. Since the compression ratio is the ratio between dynamic and static volumes of the combustion chamber the Atkinson cycle\'s method of increasing the length of the powerstroke compared to the intake stroke ultimately altered the compression ratio at different stages of the cycle.\nDynamic compression ratio\nThe calculated compression ratio, as given above, presumes that the cylinder is sealed at the bottom of the stroke, and that the volume compressed is the actual volume.\nHowever: intake valve closure (sealing the cylinder) always takes place after BDC, which may cause some of the intake charge to be compressed backwards out of the cylinder by the rising piston at very low speeds; only the percentage of the stroke after intake valve closure is compressed. Intake port tuning and scavenging may allow a greater mass of charge (at a higher than atmospheric pressure) to be trapped in the cylinder than the static volume would suggest ( This ""corrected"" compression ratio is commonly called the ""dynamic compression ratio"".\nThis ratio is higher with more conservative (i.e., earlier, soon after BDC) intake cam timing, and lower with more radical (i.e., later, long after BDC) intake cam timing, but always lower than the static or ""nominal"" compression ratio.\nThe actual position of the piston can be determined by trigonometry, using the stroke length and the connecting rod length (measured between centers). The absolute cylinder pressure is the result of an exponent of the dynamic compression ratio. This exponent is a polytropic value for the ratio of variable heats for air and similar gases at the temperatures present. This compensates for the temperature rise caused by compression, as well as heat lost to the cylinder. Under ideal (adiabatic) conditions, the exponent would be 1.4, but a lower value, generally between 1.2 and 1.3 is used, since the amount of heat lost will vary among engines based on design, size and materials used, but provides useful results for purposes of comparison. For example, if the static compression ratio is 10:1, and the dynamic compression ratio is 7.5:1, a useful value for cylinder pressure would be (7.5)^1.3 × atmospheric pressure, or 13.7 bar. (× 14.7 psi at sea level = 201.8 psi. The pressure shown on a gauge would be the absolute pressure less atmospheric pressure, or 187.1 psi.)\nThe two corrections for dynamic compression ratio affect cylinder pressure in opposite directions, but not in equal strength. An engine with high static compression ratio and late intake valve closure will have a DCR similar to an engine with lower compression but earlier intake valve closure.\nAdditionally, the cylinder pressure developed when an engine is running will be higher than that shown in a compression test for several reasons.\n- The much higher velocity of a piston when an engine is running versus cranking allows less time for pressure to bleed past the piston rings into the crankcase.\n- a running engine is coating the cylinder walls with much more oil than an engine that is being cranked at low RPM, which helps the seal.\n- the higher temperature of the cylinder will create higher pressures when running vs. a static test, even a test performed with the engine near operating temperature.\n- A running engine does not stop taking air & fuel into the cylinder when the piston reaches BDC; The mixture that is rushing into the cylinder during the downstroke develops momentum and continues briefly after the vacuum ceases (in the same respect that rapidly opening a door will create a draft that continues after movement of the door ceases). This is called scavenging. Intake tuning, cylinder head design, valve timing and exhaust tuning determine how effectively an engine scavenges.\nCompression ratio versus overall pressure ratio\nCompression ratio and overall pressure ratio are interrelated as follows:\nCompression ratio 2:1 3:1 5:1 10:1 15:1 20:1 25:1 35:1 Pressure ratio 2.64:1 4.66:1 9.52:1 25.12:1 44.31:1 66.29:1 90.60:1 145.11:1\nThe reason for this difference is that compression ratio is defined via the volume reduction:\nwhile pressure ratio is defined as the pressure increase:\nIn calculating the pressure ratio, we assume that an adiabatic compression is carried out (i.e. that no heat energy is supplied to the gas being compressed, and that any temperature rise is solely due to the compression). We also assume that air is a perfect gas. With those two assumptions we can define the relationship between change of volume and change of pressure as follows:\nwhere γ is the ratio of specific heats for air (approximately 1.4). The values in the table above are derived using this formula. Note that in reality the ratio of specific heats changes with temperature and that significant deviations from adiabatic behavior will occur.\n- ^ Encyclopedia Britannica, Compression ratio, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/130313/compression-ratio, retrieved 2009-07-21\n- ^ http://www.autoweek.com/article/20110422/NEWYORK/110429942\n- ^ http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-20015698-48.html\n- ^ http://www.caranddriver.com/news/mazda-engine-news-mazda-sky-gas-and-diesel-details-car-and-driver\n- ""Here Comes High Compression Engines "" 1949 highly detailed article in Popular Science with photos and cutaway drawings\n- Variable compression engine\n- Cam Timing vs. Compression Ratio Analysis\n- Calculating Compression Ratio changes with engine modifications\nAircraft piston engine components, systems and terminology Piston engines\n- Mechanical components\nCamshaft · Connecting rod · Crankpin · Crankshaft · Cylinder · Cylinder head · Gudgeon pin · Hydraulic tappet · Main bearing · Obturator ring · Oil pump · Piston · Piston ring · Poppet valve · Pushrod · Rocker arm · Sleeve valve · Tappet\n- Electrical components\nAir-cooled · Bore · Compression ratio · Dead centre · Engine displacement · Four-stroke engine · Horsepower · Ignition timing · Manifold pressure · Mean effective pressure · Naturally-aspirated · Monosoupape · Overhead camshaft · Overhead valve · Rotary engine · Shock-cooling · Stroke · Time between overhaul · Two-stroke engine · Valve timing · Volumetric efficiency\nPropellers Engine instruments Engine controls Fuel and induction system Other systems\nWikimedia Foundation. 2010.\nLook at other dictionaries:\ncompression ratio — n. in an internal combustion engine, the ratio of the largest volume to the smallest volume of a cylinder, measured before and after the compressing action of the piston … English World dictionary\nCompression ratio — Compression ratio.

66	I'm planning a welding project - what are the temperature transformations in steel and safety precautions needed?	Regarding temperature transformations, steel undergoes structural changes at specific temperatures: at 910°C iron transforms from body centered cubic to face centered cubic structure, and at 1390°C it reverts back. For safety precautions, a fire watch is required when combustible materials are within 35 feet or when sparks could ignite materials. The fire watch must be maintained for 30 minutes after welding stops and fire extinguishers must be immediately available.

Solve it! with\nHelp from a Welding Professional\nNote: To view Google Ads, Pls.|\nRight Click and\nOpen in a New Window.\nHeat-treating is a collective term used to indicate a group of thermal processes used to modify metal properties.\nThis page deals only with thermal cycles applied to steels.\nOther metals are treated with different processes explained elsewhere in this website.\nIt has been remarked in our page on Welding Steel, that\nthe single reason that makes steel so important is its versatility.\nBy this one means the capability of presenting economically a very wide range of mechanical properties.\nThis ability is based on the fact that tailored chemical compositions make the material responsive in subtle ways to the application of precise heat treatments.\nThis page will present an overview of some of the important processes used for Heat-treating steels.\nThere is a strict correlation between the microstructure, describing the inner make up of the basic building blocks of metallic materials, and the mechanical properties displayed.\nHeat-treating provides required Mechanical Properties\nModifying the composition of steels by alloying them with determinate elements, sometime in tiny amounts, can change their responsiveness to specific Heat-treating thermal cycles.\nThat is used to develop the mechanical properties needed to each application.\nMetallic materials are characterized by being built of crystals, ordered tri-dimensional arrangements of atoms according to a repetitive pattern, specific to the material and to the temperature.\nIn the case of pure Iron (Fe), the main constituent of steel, at room temperature the basic crystal lattice or pattern, called unit cell, is described as a cube with one (Fe) atom at each vertex and one more in the cube center.\nNote: To view Google Ads, Please|\nRight Click and\nOpen in a New Window.\nSuch a structure is called body centered cubic (BCC) alpha iron and is stable up to the temperature of 910 °C.\nAt that temperature a sudden transformation occurs, and the Iron atoms rearrange themselves at each vertex of a cube with one more atom in the center of each face.\nThis new structure is called face centered cubic (FCC) gamma iron and is stable within the range of temperatures between 910 and 1390 °C.\nUpon further increasing of the temperature beyond 1390 °C, the structure reverts back to a body centered cubic delta iron stable up to 1539 °C, but this transformation has less importance from a practical Heat-treating point of view.\nUnit cells as well as atoms cannot be seen under any microscope.\nTheir internal symmetry is inferred by x-ray diffraction methods.\nAggregates of crystals with the same orientation, called grains, are visible under the optical microscope after proper metallographic preparation (polishing and etching).\nGrain size, described by established conventions can be measured with standard metallographic methods.\nSteels are alloys of carbon and iron. Many of the interesting steel properties depend on the behavior of carbon.\nIt happens that carbon dissolves easily in gamma iron, usually called austenite, producing what is called an interstitial solid solution.\nThese are solutions in which atoms of the alloying element (in this case carbon) that are very small when compared to the size of the main atoms, occupy spaces between atoms of the solvent element (in this case iron), which retain their original lattice position.\nThe solubility of carbon in alpha iron is however much less than in gamma iron.\nTo study the behavior of a given steel as a function of changing Heat-treating temperature, one has first to know which is the carbon content.\nThe study is eased by observing the so called Iron-Carbon equilibrium diagram.\nYou may wish to inspect such an Iron-carbon phase diagram by visiting the page\nSee another example of The Iron-Carbon Equilibrium Diagram at\nSee also Principles of Heat Treating of Steels\nOn the horizontal axis the carbon content is depicted, starting with zero carbon on the left side (meaning 100% pure iron) and increasing toward the right until about 0.8 weight percent carbon, where something interesting is depicted, and then further to the right.\nOn the vertical axis temperature is marked, starting from zero up to 1539 °C at which point pure iron melts, becoming liquid.\nIn the diagram several drawn lines delimit areas where definite structures exist either singly, or coexist in mixed arrangements.\nHeat-treating permits to manipulate the mechanical properties of a metal by controlling the rate of diffusion, and the rate of cooling within the microstructure.\nHeat-treating cycles are generally divided into three parts: heating, holding and cooling.\nHeating should be uniform to avoid large temperature differences between thick and thin sections in any given part which may cause strains because of differential thermal expansion.\nFor economic reasons this part of the cycle should be as short as possible, also to avoid grain growth which is generally detrimental to properties.\nHolding at the prescribed temperature for the specific Heat-treating permits equalization and must be sufficient for the accomplishment of the required transformation, including diffusion of elements in solution.\nAt sufficiently high temperature, grains after severe plastic deformation recover and recrystallize losing hardness and gaining ductility.\nHeat-treating intended to remove internal stresses is called Stress Relieving.\nAnnealing is the process used to remove completely internal stresses from a part, to reach minimum hardness and maximum ductility.\nRemoving an annealed part from the furnace and letting it cool down in air is called normalizing.\nThe cooling phase of the Heat-treating cycle may cause different outcomes depending on the actual cooling rate.\nThe following Heat-treating is called Hardening and Tempering.\nThe austenitic phase of a steel of suitable composition, quickly cooled by a proper method, transforms to a hard phase called martensite.\nCooling quickly is called quenching.\nTo retain hardness but to remove excessive brittleness, a further tempering treatment is performed, by heating again the hard martensite at a low temperature.\nFor applications requiring substantial mechanical properties, obtainable by such Heat-treating, it is important to consider a quality called Hardenability. (Click on the link to see the page.)\nThis characteristic provides (calculates or tests) the maximum size of a body of any given steel capable to develop in the center an agreed upon volume fraction of martensite of the required hardness upon quenching.\nThe larger the size of the part, the slower the achievable cooling rate, as heat removal is possible only from the external surface.\nTherefore, if elevated hardness is required in a thick body, the steel composition must be such that it allows sluggish martensite transformations even at a rate as slow as air cooling.\nSlower than quenching cooling rates (as in large bodies of non optimized composition) produce different intermediate microstructures with lower properties, known as troostite, bainite and sorbite, less important practically except for very special situations.\nA slow cooling rate produces a structure called coarse lamellar perlite, characterized by low strength and hardness and high ductility.\nPearlite consists in alternate layers of ferrite (alpha iron) and iron carbide (called also cementite, a compound whose formula is Fe3C).\nOther steel Heat-treating processes dealt with in this website are\nFor a Book on this subject see\nHeat Treating: ASM Handbook, Vol. 4\nASM International / 01-Jun-1991 / 1012 pages\nAn Article on Advances in Industrial Heat Treating was published (11) in Issue 128 of Practical Welding Letter for April 2014.\nClick on PWL#128 to see it.\nAn Article on The Heat Treating Professional was published (11) in Issue 131 of Practical Welding Letter for July 2014.\nClick on PWL#131 to see it.\nAn Article introducing the new ASM Handbook Volume 4C on\nInduction Heating and Heat Treatment\nwas published in Issue 136 of Practical Welding Letter for December 2014.\nClick on PWL#136 to see it.\nAn Article on Measuring Depth of Decarburization was published (3) in Issue 139 of Practical Welding Letter for March 2015.\nClick on PWL#139 to see it.\nAn Article on Measuring Heating Rates in Vacuum Furnaces was published (3) in Issue 140 of Practical Welding Letter for April 2015.\nClick on PWL#140 to see it.\nAn Article on HTPro - June 2015 was published (11) in Issue 143 of Practical Welding Letter for July 2015.\nClick on PWL#143 to see it.\nAn Article on HTPro - October 2015 was published (11) in Issue 147 of Practical Welding Letter for November 2015.\nClick on PWL#147.\nAn Article on Induction Coupled Thermomagnetic Processing was published (2) in Issue 155 of Practical Welding Letter for July 2016.\nClick on PWL#155\nAn Article on Computer Modeling for Induction Hardening was published (3) in Issue 161 of Practical Welding Letter for January 2017.\nClick on PWL#161.\nAn Article on Nanostructured Metal was published (7) in Issue 162 of Practical Welding Letter for February 2017.\nClick on PWL#162.\nAn Article on New issue of HTPro was published (7) in Issue 165 of Practical Welding Letter for May 2017.\nClick on PWL#165.\nAn Article on Improvements in Vacuum Furnace Design was published (7) in Issue 167 of Practical Welding Letter for July 2017.\nClick on PWL#167.\nTo search for the most important titles of Articles published in all issues of Practical Welding Letter, click on Welding Topics.\nFor all the PAST ISSUES of Practical Welding Letter you may wish to explore, click on the Index of Past Issues of PWL.\n|Watch the following Video on\nElements of Tempering, Normalizing, and Annealing\n* * *\nAny questions or comments or feedback?

This program applies to all of those employees who may perform welding, cutting, or brazing as part of their job function.\nBasic precautions for fire prevention the object to be welded should be moved to a safe place, when possible. If the object cannot be readily moved, all movable fire hazards in the vicinity shall be moved to a safe location. If the object cannot be readily moved and all fire hazards cannot be removed, guards shall be used to confine the heat, sparks, and slag, and protect immovable fire hazards, ( ie. curtains). A fire watch is required whenever there is a possibility of fire developing. The fire watchers will have fire extinguishing equipment immediately available and shall be trained in its use. They will also be familiar with the methods used to sound an alarm. The fire watch must be maintained for at least ½ hour after welding operations have stopped.\nA fire watch is required whenever there is a possibility of a fire developing or any of the following conditions exist:\n- Appreciable combustible materials, in building construction or contents, are closer than 35 feet to the point of operation.\n- Appreciable combustibles are more than 35 feet away, but are easily ignited by sparks.\n- Wall or flooring openings within 35 foot radius expose combustible material in adjacent areas including concealed spaces in walls or floors.\n- Combustibles materials are adjacent to opposite side of metal patricians, walls, ceilings, or roofs and are likely to be ignited by conduction or radiation.\nIf the following requirements above cannot be followed, welding and cutting shall not be performed.\nHot Work Permits written must be completed by supervisory personnel prior to any welding, cutting, or brazing operations. This permit must be kept at the worksite while work is being performed. Completed permits shall be maintained in file for a period of one year. Special precautions which must be considered include:\n- Combustible Material: remove, or protect from sparks and hot slag.\n- Fire extinguishers: maintain for instant use.\n- Prohibited areas: Welding, cutting and brazing is not permitted in areas which have not been authorized.\nDo not weld, cut or braze in:\n- Atmospheres where flammable gases, vapors, liquids, or dusts are present\n- Storage areas where there are large quantities of exposed, readily ignitable materials\nWhen working on platforms, scaffolds, or runways, welders and their helpers shall be protected against falling by use of railings, safety belts, life lines, or other effective safeguards. Helmets or hand shields shall be used during all arc welding. All helpers & attendants shall be provided with proper eye protection. Goggles or other suitable eye protection shall be used during all gas welding or oxygen cutting operations. Spectacles with side shields and suitable filter lenses are required during gas welding operations on light work, torch brazing, and for inspections. Helmets and hand shields shall be arranged to protect face, neck, and ears from direct radiant energy from the arc.\nA confined space is defined as a relatively small or restricted space such as a tank, boiler, pressure vessel, or manhole. Ventilation is a prerequisite to work in confined spaces. Gas cylinders and welding machines shall be left outside. Heavy portable equipment mounted on wheels shall be securely blocked. Whenever a welder must enter a confined space through a small opening of manhole, means shall be provided to quickly remove him in the event of an emergency. Safety belts and lifelines used for this purpose shall be attached to the welder’s body so that his body cannot be jammed in a small exit opening.\nMechanical ventilation shall be provided when welding or cutting is performed on metals not listed below. These metals have their own specific allowable concentration/ventilation requirements: fluorine compounds, zinc, lead, beryllium, cadmium, mercury, cleaning compounds, and stainless steels.

The procedure\nis that the surgeon directly administers Axokine into the patient\'s brain\nand protects the nerve cells from degenerating. Unfortunalty there is no\nsignificant that this procedure does work in humans. Since it is still\nrelatively new the only testing is done in rats. But there is significant\nevidence to support that the chemical axokine protects nerve cells form\n- Neurotransplantation-Is where the surgeon transplants bits of one human\'s\nbrain to another. Currently there are 4 medical centers in the U.S. that\nare using the procedure. The procedure, which is controversial because\nit uses tissue from, aborted fetuses for the transplant. You may feel that\nthis is a contradiction. But the tissue comes from elective rather than\nspontaneous abortions. The women are asked to consent to the use to the\ntissue only after the abortion-and she is never paid. Identities of both\ndonors and recipients are confidential.\nProcedure- the nerve tissue form the patient undergoing the transplant\nis minced and mixed with prepared tissue from at least 3 fetuses. Then,\n2 small holes are bored in the patient\'s head; degenerative points in the\nbrain are mapped with the use of a MRI. Then the tissue mixture is grafted\nonto damaged sections of the brain with a needle. Although still relatively\nnew it appears the operation can reverse some to he debilitating Huntington\'s\nCase Study- Jim and Sam Fitz\n- Jim, 47, and his brother, Sam, 57\n- Both men underwent neurotransplantation surgery\n- Prior to the surgery Jim found it difficult to process questions or\nfrom coherent answers.\n- While Sam exhibited slurred speech and involuntary muscle spasms that\nmade him unsteady and created jerky movements.\n- After the procedure Jim is now able to converse with family and friends.\n- Sam\'s speech still bears slight traces of slurring, but is remarkably\nclear. And as of yet he does not suffer from any tremors.\n- This procedure is not a cure both men must undergo therapy in the form\nof exercises-both for the body and the brain.\n- Quote from Sam, ""My body feels like it belongs to me again, before\nI felt like a big shaky bowl of jelly, I\'m starting to feel like myself\nagain, I can finally see a future without a wheelchair.""\nI\'m not going to disagree that Huntington\'s disease is not a terrible\ndisorder to have and for most people who are in the late symptoms of the\ndisease a possible cure is probably too late.\nBut we are talking about an unborn fetus and as statistics show the\nsymptoms of Huntington\'s disease doesn\'t even appear until midlife (30-45)\nAnd on top of that the symptoms may run anywhere from 10 to 25 years.\nSay for example, that the woman is pregnant now. That means it may be\n2028 at the earliest that this disease starts to show up. And given the\nevidence that these treatments I have just discussed who\'s to say that\nthere won\'t be a cure before this person start too show symptoms of Huntingtons\'s\nAlso I read that these genetic tests are about 95% accurate. And although\nthat pretty accurate there is still a 5% chance the test could be wrong.\nCase study- 2 women in England\n- 2 women entered the hospital the same day to have some tests\n- The hospital confirmed that one of the women baby had down\'s syndrome\n- So the women who thought she had a baby with downs syndrome elected\nto have an abortion.\n- It was only after the abortion that the hospital realized that they\nhad gotten the two women\'s lab results mixed up and had actually aborted\na healthy baby.\n- When the other women who thought she had a healthy baby found out the\ntruth she aborted her baby also.\n- 2 babies died when only 1 would have.\nSo with the information presented here by A.J. and I we see no reason\nwhy anyone should abort a fetus even if it shows strong evidence for developing\nMany core ethical issues were addressed\nin this topic: abortion, genetic testing, and various neurological diseases.\nBrian and I posed the argument that you should not abort a fetus based\non the fact that it has the potential to have Huntington\'s Disease later\nin life. In order for us to make this argument, we gave a background on\nthe clinical genetic testing and treatment that could be done in the case\nof Huntington\'s Disease. For example, in March of 1993 scientists announced\nthat they had found the gene which causes HD. Due to this somewhat recent\ndiscovery, many avenues of research are presently being investigated in\nthe search for a treatment or cure for HD. The gene discovery has also\nmade it possible for a new predictive test for HD which allows those at\nrisk to find out whether or not they will develop the disease. Because\nof these recent advances in the field of genetics, techniques in which\ngeneticists can determine if a fetus will be deformed or afflicted genetically\nare also being developed and modified. The advances in genetic testing,\nwhile remarkable, are also allowing devastating consequences: more and\nmore parents are choosing to abort their unborn children. The dilemmas\nposed by new genetic technology are nowhere more agonizing than for prospective\nparents who are increasingly faced with a bewildering range of opportunities\nand choices as they contemplate doing what used to be the most natural\nthing in the world, and who soon may find themselves having to decide whether\nor not to terminate a pregnancy because their child is at risk for Huntington\'s\nDisease. Carried one step further, the ability to find out whether or not\na child will be deformed or afflicted might cause the death of a normal\nindividual in a effort to be rid of a possibly genetically diseased fetus.\nWe need to closely examine the ways in which genetic technology affects\nour attitudes. Close to 100% of women who have tested positive from amniocenteses\nfor Down\'s syndrome have abortions. Aborting defective or diseased fetuses\nis widely sanctioned because if born, they are a burden....their families\nwould suffer, they may suffer, and society suffers. We have this need for\nperfection in our society..we need to detect and eliminate defective babies.\nWe have this warped mentality that we are in control of our very existence\nand that we can develop some sort of ""super-race"". We need to\nrecognize the limits of humanity and quit trying to play God. I found a\nquote from a woman whose fetus was at risk for HD and she refused genetic\ntesting. She states, ""In our success-oriented, beauty-obsessed culture,\nthe low intelligence or physical handicaps of defective, deformed, or diseased\nbabies leads us to assume that such an individual\'s life is not worth living.\nAnd yet we are appalled that anyone would abort a fetus just because it\nis a girl. But the Chinese and Indians routinely do so. To Indians, a female\nchild can be a lifelong burden; to be a female in China is to risk abandonment\nor even murder; it\'s not a life worth living. The point is that the value\nwe put on human life is socially and culturally conditioned. We may believe\nwe are doing the right thing, but are we?"" Should we abort every deformed,\ndefected, or diseased baby? If not all of them, then we just abort one.\nWe can select whose life is going to be more valuable than others, because\nevery single life has meaning and a purpose.\nBrian and I made several arguments opposed to abortion\nin this case. For example, if one does carry the gene for HD they have\na 50% of not getting the disease. In retrospect, they also have a 50% chance\nof developing symptoms. Even then one does not usually develop symptoms\nuntil the fourth or fifth decade. So one could live a completely normal\nlife until age 40 or 50. Many middle-aged men and women lead fulfilling\nlives and can contribute to society. HD usually progresses over a 10 to\n25 year period, so one would live for 60 or 75 years. In our opinion, 40\nyears is better than no years! In 40 years there could be a cure for all\nwe know! We all die sometime. If you knew your child was going to be in\na car accident and be a quadriplegic from age 16 on, would you abort him/her\nfrom birth...or would you just wait until he/she was handicapped and then\nkill them? Of course you wouldn\'t! You would love that person and that\nindividual would have probably contributed some meaning to your life. Suppose\nyour ""healthy"" child developed spinal meningitis, are your going\nto kill that child too because he is a burden? Every life has the potential\nto affect another\'s whether the individual is healthy, deformed, or diseased.\nTake a chance on life, your life and theirs.', 'Discussion: Ethical Questions in Screening for Genetic Diseases\nGenetic screening is still a new and exciting field.\nThe integration of genetics in public healthcare offers many opportunities for health promotion and disease prevention.\nThere are three types of genetic screening that can be used for public health purposes: carrier, diagnostic, and predictive.\nThe most popular form of genetic screening is prenatal and neonatal screening. It helps to identify current diseases (e.g., Down syndrome, phenylketonuria).\nCarrier screening determines if an individual is carrying a particular genetic trait (e.g. type 2 diabetes, breast cancer).\nA predictive screening checks whether an otherwise healthy individual with positive family histories has a genetic mutation that could lead to late-onset disorders (e.g. Huntington’s Disease).\nAs the population genetic screening expands from the newborn to adult-onset arena, there are increasing concerns about whether such screening might have a negative psychological impact and discrimination by third parties including employers and insurers.\nEthical concerns are also raised about privacy, confidentiality, and individual autonomy.\nReview the Learning Recourses to find a article in the Walden Library about a genetic disorder.\nIt can be a genetic condition or a disease with a genetic component.\nYou should consider the ethical implications of screening for genetic disease.\nKeep these thoughts in your mind:\nGive a brief overview of the article. Also describe the genetic epidemiology and cause of the disease.\nOne ethical question related to screening is this disease.\nYour argument for or against mandatory screening for this condition is presented.\nYou can support your position with scholarly resources.\nGenetic testing is a modern technology that helps to identify susceptibilities to any disease or defect.\nGenetic testing is a useful diagnostic tool that can be used for both personal and healthcare purposes.\nThe genetic testing process can help detect complicated diseases like colon, breast, ovarian, or ovarian cancer at an early stage (Harper 2010).\nThis essay will discuss the most controversial ethical issue in genetic testing of breast cancer. The patient confidentiality of their breast cancer genetic testing information is discussed.\nThis essay discusses a similar issue, and provides rationale for mandatory breast cancer screening.\nGenetic Epidemiology Of Breast Cancer\nBreast cancer is second in most cases in females, after skin cancer.\nBreast cancer was responsible for 13.7% of all female deaths worldwide in 2008.\nContemporary lifestyles have contributed to an increase in breast cancer deaths over the past 70 years (Davis 2010).\nButow and colleagues.\nButow et al. (2013) found that one in eight women has a lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Additionally, one out of every 35 women who dies from cancer is at risk.\nThe United States has the highest annual breast cancer rate at 128.7 percent for 15,000 Whites and 111.6 percent for 15,000 African Americans.\nPeterson et. al.\n(2012) Breast cancer continues to be the most serious form of cancer in women in the United States.\nThe genetic testing for breast carcinoma is such a grave hazard, there are ethical concerns about its confidentiality and sharing.\nGoldenberg & Sharp (2012) conducted a survey that asked 160 relatives of the victims to find out their family history of breast carcinoma.\nOut of 376 participants 71% were first- or second-blood relatives while 82% were blood relations.\n24% of participants didn’t know about or were not informed about their family history. The remaining 76% were blood relations.\nThis suggests that this is a sensitive topic.\nBrierley and colleagues (2012) looked at the potential impact of confidentiality, cost, and discrimination on those who pursue genetic testing.\nThe study, which involved 184 participants, found that 106 of them underwent testing while 78 refused testing. This was due to cost, confidentiality and discrimination.\nAccording to Butow and colleagues.\n2013 survey of 238 relatives of breast cancer victims revealed that they were concerned about confidentiality and autonomy when it came to genetic testing.\nThe results showed that 86-87% of women disapproved of the disclosure of genetic results. 56-57% desired informed consent before sharing information with any family members. 98% preferred mandatory and voluntary genetic testing.\nThis suggests that genetic screening of breast cancer is important and necessary, but also poses ethical problems.\nAn Overview of the Article\nThis article will discuss the legal and ethical aspects of genetic testing for breast, ovarian and colon cancer.\nThese three types of cancer have almost the same privacy and confidentiality as a woman’s life.\nThis article describes the ethical conflict that patients must keep private information and the professional’s duty to share information for the benefit of others.\nThe articles provide information on disclosure obligations and the duties related to genetic susceptibility. Further, they discuss confidentiality and liabilities in genetic counselling, prenatal diagnosis and genetic screening.\nThis article discusses the public’s perceptions of genetic discrimination and public health testing. It also addresses ethical concerns related to breast carcinoma.\nThis article’s author has found that genetic testing for breast carcinoma is an ethical concern for feminists.\nTheir attitudes to new technologies and society’s trends are determined by the traditional views, political and professional authority of women.\nWomen are still being victim to traditional feminist perceptions.\nHowever, attempts are being made to alter traditional views and increase awareness and alertness of the female sector of society.\nLastly, however, the article mentions that ethical issues and conflicts concerning genetic testing susceptibility to breast cancer will still remain a feminist topic. It is therefore necessary to promote healthcare ethics and feminist methods to ensure women have their autonomy as well confidentiality.\nGenetic Screening for Breast Cancer: A Moral Issue\nDue to privacy, security and feminism, the confidentiality of patients has always been a significant ethical issue in genetic screening.\nAccording to Harper (2010), disclosure of breast cancer screening information is an overrated ethical issue and requires specific legal obligations.\nButow and colleagues.\nThe 2013 study found that even family members with a history or breast cancer were not informed about the situation.\nContemporary genetic screening practices have been affected by this.\n53% of the 1,251 physicians who handled genetic screening of breast carcinoma said that they need to keep their patients’ confidential information.\n(2012) showed that any American healthcare provider is required by law to protect patient information.\nFor genetic screening, confidentiality breaches can be considered a criminal offense.\nThis prevents physicians from disclosing information, even if a relative is at risk for similar diseases.\nClayton et al. (2014) found that breast, colon, ovary, and lung cancers are the most serious cancers for children, siblings, or other family members.\nAccording to confidentiality law, the physician does not have a legal obligation to warn the patient about this risk.\nIf a physician is aware that a patient could infect a spouse, it is their legal responsibility to inform the spouse.\nIn order to ensure that genetic screening of breast carcinoma is done ethically, this vision is unclear.\nReasons for Mandatory Breast Cancer Genetic Screening\nGenetic screening for breast cancer should be an integral part of public health. This is regardless of conflict or ethical concerns. Increased risk of such deadly diseases can threaten the equilibrium of human survival.\nModern methods like genetic screening provide a safe diagnosis that ensures the existence or safety of the risk to the foetus even through prenatal screening. This provides a promising control for future risk (Davis 2010).\nDancey and colleagues.\nMandatory genetic screening, (2012) will aid in timely counselling and lower the risk for vulnerable deaths.\n(2014) state that mandatory genetic testing for breast cancer could revolutionize healthcare worldwide and help women to feel more secure about their status in society.\nThese are all reasons that genetic screening should be mandatory for women’s health.\nThis study shows that confidentiality remains an ethical issue when genetic screening is done for breast cancer.\nBecause of traditional beliefs, privacy, protection of vulnerable and other reasons, it is an ethical issue.\nHowever, genetic screening for the diagnosis of breast cancer is a promising option for improving women’s health by avoiding deadly consequences and reducing their risk.\nGenetic dilemmas: Reproductive technology, parental choices, children’s futures.\nOxford University Press.\nPractical Genetic Counselling 7th Ed.\nNegative events in cancer genetic testing: financial, medical, ethical and legal implications.\nThe Cancer Journal 18(4), 309-309.\nPsychological outcomes and risk perceptions following genetic counselling in breast cancer: A systematic review.\nMedical Journal of Australia 178(2): 77-81.\nClayton, E.

68	Hey, I'm confused about war powers - if another country declares war on the US when Congress isn't in session, can the President order our ships to capture enemy vessels or just fight them?	According to constitutional principles, when a foreign nation declares war on the United States, the President can order ships to both fight and capture enemy vessels, even without Congress declaring war. This is because when one nation declares war, it automatically creates a complete state of war between both countries, giving each side the right to both kill in battle and capture the persons and property of the other.	"['Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11\nAlexander Hamilton, The Examination, no. 117 Dec. 1801Papers 25:454--57\nThe Message of the President, by whatever motives it may have been dictated, is a performance which ought to alarm all who are anxious for the safety of our Government, for the respectability and welfare of our nation. It makes, or aims at making, a most prodigal sacrifice of constitutional energy, of sound principle, and of public interest, to the popularity of one man.\nThe first thing in it which excites our surprise, is the very extraordinary position, that though Tripoli had declared war in form against the United States, and had enforced it by actual hostility, yet that there was not power, for want of the sanction of Congress, to capture and detain her cruisers with their crews.\nWhen the newspapers informed us, that one of these cruisers, after being subdued in a bloody conflict, had been liberated and permitted quietly to return home, the imagination was perplexed to divine the reason. The conjecture naturally was, that pursuing a policy, too refined perhaps for barbarians, it was intended by that measure to give the enemy a strong impression of our magnanimity and humanity. No one dreampt of a scruple as to the right to seize and detain the armed vessel of an open and avowed foe, vanquished in battle. The enigma is now solved, and we are presented with one of the most singular paradoxes, ever advanced by a man claiming the character of a statesman. When analyzed, it amounts to nothing less than this, that between two nations there may exist a state of complete war on the one side--of peace on the other.\nWar, of itself, gives to the parties a mutual right to kill in battle, and to capture the persons and property of each other. This is a rule of natural law; a necessary and inevitable consequence of the state of war. This state between two nations is completely produced by the act of one--it requires no concurrent act of the other. It is impossible to conceive the idea, that one nation can be in full war with another, and this other not in the same state with respect to its adversary. The moment therefore that two nations are, in an absolute sense, at war, the public force of each may exercise every act of hostility, which the general laws of war authorise, against the persons and property of the other. As it respects this conclusion, the distinction between offensive and defensive war, makes no difference. That distinction is only material to discriminate the agressing nation from that which defends itself against attack. The war is offensive on the part of the state which makes it; on the opposite side it is defensive: but the rights of both, as to the measure of hostility, are equal.\nIt will be readily allowed that the Constitution of a particular country may limit the Organ charged with the direction of the public force, in the use or application of that force, even in time of actual war: but nothing short of the strongest negative words, of the most express prohibitions, can be admitted to restrain that Organ from so employing it, as to derive the fruits of actual victory, by making prisoners of the persons and detaining the property of a vanquished enemy. Our Constitution happily is not chargeable with so great an absurdity. The framers of it would have blushed at a provision, so repugnant to good sense, so inconsistent with national safety and inconvenience. That instrument has only provided affirmatively, that, ""The Congress shall have power to declare War;"" the plain meaning of which is that, it is the peculiar and exclusive province of Congress, when the nation is at peace, to change that state into a state of war; whether from calculations of policy or from provocations or injuries received: in other words, it belongs to Congress only, to go to War. But when a foreign nation declares, or openly and avowedly makes war upon the United States, they are then by the very fact, already at war, and any declaration on the part of Congress is nugatory: it is at least unnecessary. This inference is clear in principle, and has the sanction of established practice. It is clear in principle, because it is self-evident, that a declaration by one nation against another, produce[s] at once a complete state of war between both; and that no declaration on the other side can at all vary their relative situation: and in practice it is well known, that nothing is more common, than when war is declared by one party, to prosecute mutual hostilities, without a declaration by the other.\nThe doctrine of the Message includes the strange absurdity, that, without a declaration of war by Congress, our public force may destroy the life, but may not restrain the liberty, or seize the property of an enemy. This was exemplified in the very instance of the Tripolitan corsair. A number of her crew were slaughtered in the combat, and after she was subdued she was set free with the remainder. But it may perhaps be said, that she was the assailant, and that resistance was an act of mere defence, and self-preservation. Let us then pursue the matter a step further. Our ships had blockaded the Tripolitan Admiral in the bay of Gibraltar; suppose, he had attempted to make his way out, without first firing upon them: if permitted to do it, the blockade was a farce; if hindered by force, this would have amounted to more than a mere act of defence; and if a combat had ensued, we should then have seen an unequivocal illustration of the unintelligible right, to take the life but not to abridge the liberty, or capture the property of an enemy.\nLet us suppose an invasion of our territory, previous to a declaration of war by Congress. The principle avowed in the Message would authorize our troops to kill those of the invader, if they should come within the reach of their bayonets, perhaps to drive them into the sea, and drown them; but not to disable them from doing harm, by the milder process of making them prisoners, and sending them into confinement. Perhaps it may be replied, that the same end would be answered by disarming and leaving them to starve. The merit of such an argument would be complete by adding, that should they not be famished, before the arrival of their ships, with a fresh supply of arms, we might then, if able, disarm them a second time, and send them on board their fleet, to return safely home.\nThe inconvenience of the doctrine in practice, is not less palpable than its folly in theory. In every case it presents a most unequal warfare. In the instance which has occurred, the vanquished Barbarian got off with the loss of his guns. Had he been victorious, the Americans, whose lives might have been spared, would have been doomed to wear out a miserable existence in slavery and chains. Substantial benefits would have rewarded his success; while on our side, life, liberty and property, were put in jeopardy, for an empty triumph. This, however, was a partial inconvenience--cases may arise in which evils of a more serious and comprehensive nature wou\'d be the fruits of this visionary and fantastical principle. Suppose that, in the recess of Congress, a foreign maritime power should unexpectedly declare war against the United States, and send a fleet and army to seize Rhode-Island, in order from thence to annoy our trade and our seaport towns. Till the Congress should assemble and declare war, which would require time, our ships might, according to the hypothesis of the Message, be sent by the President to fight those of the enemy as often as they should be attacked, but not to capture and detain them: If beaten, both vessels and crews whould be lost to the United States: if successful, they could only disarm those they had overcome, and must suffer them to return to the place of common rendezvous, there to equip anew, for the purpose of resuming their depredations on our towns and our trade.\nWho could restrain the laugh of derision at positions so preposterous, were it not for the reflection that in the first magistrate of our country, they cast a blemish on our national character? What will the world think of the fold when such is the shepherd?\nThe Papers of Alexander Hamilton. Edited by Harold C. Syrett et al. 26 vols.

69	compare preservation radio tanzania archives digitization versus mughal emperor biographies documentation preservation	While Radio Tanzania archives contain approximately 100,000 hours of unique material including speeches and music that need digitization from reel-to-reel format, the Mughal Emperors documented their histories through detailed biographies like Babur's Baburnama and Shah Jahan's Padshahnama, which contained paintings and were preserved in institutions like the British Library and Windsor Castle.	['“Kitunze kidumu / If you take care of something, it will last.” – Swahili Proverb\nIn Tanzania, priceless archives and rare collections of analogue music are in grave danger of being lost or destroyed by climate, lack of resources, or neglect. To lose these collections to fire, flood, or simply the elements of time, would be a tragedy for musicians, scholars, historians, music-lovers, and ultimately for Tanzania itself.\nWe restore and revitalize cultural heritage using new and innovative technologies and approaches. Luckily, technology is improving at unprecedented speeds, making digitization and digital storage more affordable and effective than ever. We aim to take advantage of the technological revolution by caring for the heritage that has been left for us.\nPromoting endangered or at-risk culture can also have a social impact. Digitizing and making archival music available to the people can provide training, jobs, and income. Proper digitization combats piracy and benefits artists. Cultural preservation can improve lives and create opportunities.\n“Of all the crimes of colonialism, there is none worse than the attempt to make us believe that we had no indigenous culture of our own, or that what we did have was worthless or something of which we should be ashamed, instead of being a source of pride.” – Julius K. Nyerere\nRadio Tanzania Dar es Salaam was Tanzania’s sole radio station and professional recording studio for the first twenty-five years of independence. The archives — which contain approximately 100,000 hours of unique material including speeches and music — have never been digitized from their original reel-to-reel format. The recordings, which chronicle Tanzania’s history as a nation, have languished for decades, exposed to heat, humidity, and natural decay. In most cases, the Radio Tanzania recordings are the only copies that exist — and until now, only a few people have had access to them.\nThe Tanzania Heritage Project creates awareness about this priceless collection, explores its historic significance and continued cultural relevance, and advocates for its digitization and preservation.\n“A country which lacks its own culture is no more than a collection of people without the spirit which makes them a nation.” – Julius K. Nyerere\nMusic doesn’t belong on dusty shelves or in hidden libraries. It belongs to the people. Access to culture is a human right that must be pursued and protected. Cultural preservation can be collaborative, creative, and celebratory. New methods of preservation, digital storage, and music sharing come with new ways of working with custodians of culture: with respect and partnership.\nWe host an online archive of music, lyrics, and information about artists and groups. We also curate a listening station at the Music Mayday school where students can listen to and learn more about their musical heritage. We also repatriate music to musicians or their families once it is digitized, and sometimes it is the first time in decades that these artists have had the opportunity to hear their music again.\nArt is dynamic and always evolving. Culture is never static. It challenges, provokes, and inspires. Every new creation is in conversation with the past. To know where we are headed, we have to know where we have been.\nBecause culture is constantly in flux, it’s a little misleading to talk about “cultural preservation” as though there were a time in the past when music was stuck or unchanging. We need to focus on understanding the evolution of music and culture over time, in conversation with the past, present, and future at any given moment. Preserving music from the past isn’t just so we can capture something we’re nostalgic about– it’s so we can continue to grow and move forward.\nThere are a few ways we celebrate Tanzanian music and culture through storytelling and creating spaces for active, participatory cultural preservation.\n“If you can talk, you can sing; if you can walk, you can dance.” – Zimbabwean proverb\nMusic transcends language, boundaries, and cultural differences. There is nothing more essential to humanity than art. In East Africa, the creative sector is blossoming with innovation, creativity, and opportunity.\nIn order to take advantage of the potential in this space, artists and organisations need professional support and infrastructure. There are many organisations doing amazing work to support and promote the arts in Tanzania, and THP collaborates with them whenever we get the chance.\nLearn about our partners and clients here\n“Pamoja kwa muziki / Together for the Music”\nMusic unites people. We provide a platform to amplify the voices of the past, and for artists, communities and cultures who want to keep their heritage alive.\nOur mission is to make the world a more beautiful place by finding endangered music and sharing it with the world.\nWe offer opportunities for people and artists to connect with each other and Tanzanian heritage by offering several services in addition to our NGO work. They fall under four categories: Digitization, Artist Services, Industry Services, and Music Tours.\nLearn about our services here.', 'Though perhaps not as well known as other historical empires, for nearly 300 years the Mughal Empire ruled over the Indian Subcontinent, and their rule would have an enormous effect on the history and culture of South Asia. Here are some interesting facts about one of the largest and most powerful empires in the history of India.\nMughal Empire Facts\n24. Cotton Manufacturing\nTextile manufacturing, particularly for cotton, became a major component of the Mughal Empire. Cotton production flourished in the Empire due to innovations like the gear worm cotton gin, which is thought to have originated during the Delhi Sultanate era. Other innovations like the addition of a crank handle to the cotton gin and the use of the spinning wheel further grew the Mughal cotton industry and allowing them to export the important fabric all across the world.\n23. Influences on Cuisine\nOne of the enduring legacies of the Mughal Empire is its influence on the cuisine of South Asia. The Mughal Era ushered in Central Asian and Persian traditions such as the use of fragrant spices like cinnamon and saffron and the use of dairy products like cream and butter in rich curries. Popular South Asian dishes that have Mughal roots include biryani, a fragrant dish of rice and meat flavored with spices, the yogurt based curry known as korma, and kulfi, a dense ice cream-like frozen dessert. These dishes are all part of what today is called Mughlai cuisine.\n22. Origins of the Empire\nThe Emperor Babur established the Mughal Empire in 1526. Babur was born in what is now Uzbekistan and was a descendant of the Emperor Timur of the Timurid dynasty, also known as Tamerlane. Seeking to establish his own royal imprint on history, Babur ventured east and initially conquered Kabul, in Afghanistan, before going to Delhi where he defeated Ibrahim Lodi of the ruling Delhi Sultanate in the Battle of Panipat. His victory would mark the start of the Mughal Empire.\n21. Growing Pains of an Empire\nHolding onto their newly acquired lands proved to be quite the challenge for the Mughals. After victory at Panipat, Babur had to contend with the Rajputs, who he defeated in the Battle of Khanwa. Following Babur’s death, his son Humayun ascended to the throne, but his reign was marked with instability. The forces of what would become the Sur Empire defeated Humayan and the Mughals. Humayun was exiled to Persia for over a decade, but with the help of the ruling Safavid dynasty, Humayun was eventually able to reclaim his empire. What, you thought the Mughals were done that quick?\n20. Imposing Ancestors\nThe Mughal Empire can trace its lineage to two of history’s most powerful rulers. Babur, the empire’s founder, is the descendant of both Timur of the Timurid Dynasty and Genghis Khan of the Mongol Empire. The first two Mughal rulers were of Central Asian descent, with large Mongol ancestry with strong Turkic influences, such as the adoption of Islam as their religion. As a result, the Mughal Empire is often said to have Turco-Mongol roots.\n19. Linguistic Legacy\nThe official language of the empire was Persian. However, over the years and decades of their rule, Persian words and phrases were heavily adopted into the native languages of the conquered lands. The Persian influence is most pronounced in the language of Urdu, the national language of Pakistan and one of the official languages of India. While Urdu is virtually the same as Hindi (together they are often referred to as Hindi-Urdu or Hindustani), Urdu is distinct for using a script that’s based on the Persian alphabet, whereas Hindi uses a Devanagari script derived from the ancient Sanskrit language.\n18. Architectural Acclaim\nThe architecture of the Mughals is perhaps one of the most visible testaments of their power, wealth, and great artistic sensibilities. Mughal architecture is characterized by the use of vaulted entryways, large bulbous domes, and ornate decorations that were influenced by Turkic, Persian, and Indian architecture traditions. Mughal buildings that are still intact today are some of South Asia’s most popular tourist attractions.\n17. Taj Mahal\nThe most iconic example of Mughal architecture is the Taj Mahal. Located in Agra, India, the Taj Mahal was commissioned by Emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his beloved late wife Mumtaz. The highly ornate structure of white marble took nearly 20 years to be completed. The UNESCO World Heritage Site is one of the world’s most visited attractions. In 2014, between seven and eight million tourists made the trip to see the remarkable structure.\n16. Bollywood Epic\nOver the years, many period films set during the height of the Mughal era and depicting the lives of its rulers have been released in Bollywood. One noteworthy Mughal-set film is Mughal-e-Azam, which was released in 1960. The lavish, high-budget picture was in production for over 16 years. When it was finally released, it would go onto be the highest grossing Bollywood film at the time, a distinction it held for fifteen years.\n15. All Great Things Come to an End\nStarting in the mid-18th century, the Mughal Empire began to experience many crucial losses. They ceded much of their territory to the Marathas. Moreover, many of their subdivisions, like Bengal and Hyderabad, would declare their independence due to inadequate support from the central authorities. At its end, the Mughal territory was confined to just the city of Shahjahanabad, present-day Old Delhi. The last Mughal Emperor, Bahadur Shah II, supported the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and as a result, was imprisoned by the British and exiled to Burma. The British would take over the remaining Mughal land and initiated direct crown rule of its Indian territories, known as the British Raj.\n14. Akbar the Great\nThe longest reigning ruler of the Mughal Empire was Akbar. Akbar was the third Mughal Emperor, reigning for 49 years from 1556 to his death in 1605. Akbar is credited with expanding the Empire’s territory over the Indian Subcontinent and thus exponentially growing the Empire’s wealth. He was able to win the trust of his subjects by committing to policies that were more inclusive of people of other faiths and cultures.\n13. Bengal Subah\nThe Mughal Empire’s most prosperous subdivision was the Bengal Subah province. The province contributed to over half of the Empire’s GDP, and 12% of the entire world’s GDP. Aided by a program of agrarian reform, products from the Bengal Subah like cotton, silk, rice were used throughout the Empire and were also exported to Europe and other parts of Asia. The Bengal Subah also became a major centre of global shipbuilding.\n12. Not Your Average Book Illustration\nMughal art was characterized by miniature paintings which served as illustrations for books or for albums featuring a collection of paintings. The style was largely influenced by the Persian tradition of miniature art. The second Mughal emperor Humayun was very impressed by the Persian art form during his exile there. Upon his return to the Indian Subcontinent, he brought with him two Persian painters. These Mughal paintings commonly used watercolors and gold leaf.\n11. Gunpowder Empires\nAlong with the Ottoman Empire and the Safavid Persian Empire, the Mughal Empire is considered an Islamic Gunpowder Empire. The early successes of the Mughals may be attributed to their use of gunpowder-fueled artillery. Although they were often outnumbered during the Battle of Panipat, the Mughals prevailed due to their superior weaponry and sophisticated use of artillery positions. The Mughals became large manufacturers of firearms, made with bronze mined from the cities of Calicut and Diu. The Mughals also became leading exporters of saltpeter, a constituent ingredient of gunpowder, which was traded with many European powers. A pretty lucrative business in the age of gunpowder.\n10. Biographies of the Emperors\nThe Mughal Emperors had the foresight to document their histories and thus, cement their legacies. The tradition started with the first Emperor Babur, whose memoir Baburnama contains the story of how he came to be a ruler and the founder of one history’s great empires. Babur wrote his memoir in his native Chagatai language and it would be later translated to Persian during the reign of Akbar. Another celebrated biography is the Padshahnama, which was commissioned by the Emperor Shah Jahan. This volume features many paintings depicting great moments from his reign. Rare original versions of the manuscript are held at the British Library and the Royal Library at Windsor Castle.\n9. Etymology of Mughal\nThe name Mughal is thought to be derived from an Arabic and Persian corruption of the word Mongol. Mongol, of course, refers to the Mongol Empire, which Babur, the first Mughal Emperor, descended from. Babur himself preferred to call it the Timurid Empire, noting his specific dynastic family clan from Central Asia. Following Babur, the Mughals would often refer to their dynasty as Gurkani, meaning sons-in-law. The empire was also referred to as Hindustan, a Persian term referencing the Indus River and Valley that is still widely used today an alternate name of India.\n8. One of the Largest Empires of the Subcontinent\nThe Mughal Empire reached its peak territory around 1690, covering nearly all of the Indian Subcontinent (present-day India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) and parts of present-day Afghanistan. At its peak, the Mughal Empire was 122% the size of the current geographical size of the Republic of India. Only the Maurya Empire in 250 BC and the British Raj prior to the Partition of India in 1947 commanded more territory.\n7. The Majestic Gardens of the Mughals\nThe ornate architectural features of Mughal buildings and monuments were matched by the exquisitely manicured gardens that surrounded them. The Mughal gardens were heavily influenced by Persian landscaping conventions, which in turn were inspired by references to gardens in the Quran. The gardens were often quadrilateral in design and contained water features like pools and fountains. One of the most famous Mughal gardens is the Shalimar Gardens in Lahore (in present-day Pakistan), which were commissioned during the reign of Shah Jahan.\n6. Economic Prowess\nAt its peak in the 17th century, the Mughal Empire was the world’s largest economic power. It made up nearly a quarter of the world’s entire GDP. Relying on a large workforce, the Empire became one of the world’s leading manufacturing powers and ushered in an era of proto-industrialization—a precursor to the great Industrial Revolution that took place in Britain during the 18th century.\n5. Urban Life\nFor its time, the Mughal Empire was highly urbanized. At its peak in the 17th century, 15% of the population resided in major urban centers; a mark that would not be reached in Europe until 200 years later. During the reign of Akbar, there were 120 cities and 3,200 townships. The biggest cities in the Mughal Empire were Agra, Delhi, Lahore, and Dhaka.\n4. Hooked on Hookah\nThe hookah or waterpipe (also known as shisha) is thought to be a Mughal era invention. It was developed by one of Emperor Akbar’s doctors after the introduction of tobacco to the Mughal Empire by Jesuit missionaries in the 16th century. Smoking hookah became a popular pastime amongst the wealthy of the empire, as evidenced by its numerous depictions in Mughal era artwork.\n3. Siege of Delhi\nIn 1857, Indian soldiers of the British East India Company known as sepoy staged a rebellion against their British superiors. Their rebellion saw them capture the city of Delhi, which had been serving as a refuge for the last vestiges of the Mughal Empire. The sepoys attempted to restore the once great Empire. However, the action only sparked a violent siege of the city by the British that resulted in many lives lost on both sides of the conflict, including civilians. Ironically, this attempt to restore the Mughal Empire to its former glory only hastened its demise.\n2. The Koh-i-Noor Diamond is an Empire’s Best Friend\nThe famed Koh-i-Noor diamond, thought to be one of the largest diamonds in the world, was in the possession of many Mughal emperors. The first emperor Babur made reference to the diamond in his memoirs. Shah Jahan had the diamond encrusted on his highly ornate Peacock Throne. However, in the midst of an attack on Delhi orchestrated by the Persian ruler Nader Shah, the precious jewel was looted. Ownership of the diamond would subsequently change hands many times over the years before ending up in the possession of Queen Victoria. Since then, the Koh-i-Noor diamond has been a part of the British Crown Jewels.\n1. The Legend of Anarkali\nOne of the most widely told stories from the Mughal Era is the rag-to-riches-to tragic end tale of Anarkali. Once a courtesan, Anarkali would eventually become a wife of Emperor Akbar. However, she would go onto have an affair with Akbar’s brother Salim, the then-Crown Prince and future Emperor Jahangir. For her transgressions, Akbar ordered her to be buried alive in the wall of one of his palaces.

70	lincoln views slavery change over time	Lincoln's views on slavery evolved significantly. Early in his administration he had complex views on slavery, but his position changed between 1862-1865, ultimately leading to the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and his signing of the 13th Amendment in 1865 to abolish slavery.	['1) Ask the class to think about the past year, and how life in the United States has changed over the past 12 months. Get the students to describe changes in the U.S. economy, politics, music, technology, or other areas of change. You may want to record students’ responses on the board.\n2) Review the list the class developed of changes that occurred over the last 12 months. Next, the students will think about how things have changed over the course of their entire lifetimes.\n3) Divide the students into five groups. Assign one of the following topics to each group:\n• Clothing and hairstyles\n• Foods you enjoy\n• Ways of communicating (such as the Internet and telephones)\n• Language and Popular Expressions\n• Favorite music\n4) Ask each group to jot down ideas about how their specific topic has changed or evolved over the course of their lifetimes. How are things different now than they were earlier in their lives? Does anything from the past seem funny or strange now, and if so, what? Ask students to come up with as many specific examples as possible.\n5) Ask each group to report out on the changes and developments for their topic. Encourage the other groups to share additional ideas for each topic. After each group has reported out, turn the discussion to an examination of why these changes occurred. For example, were they the result of improving technology, trends taking off from movies and TV shows, the students’ growing older, the influence of advertising, or something else?\n6) Now the students will think specifically about changes in their own lives. Each student will consider how he or she has changed as an individual from the person they were five years ago, especially in terms of preferences, attitudes, and opinions. Ask each student to write down several sentences reflecting on how they have personally changed in the last five years.\n7) When everyone is done writing, ask a few students to share their responses. Also ask these students, and the class, to discuss some of the reasons the changes may have occurred. You may also want to share some of the changes you have experienced over the course of the last 5 years or your entire life.\n8) Explain that, as this activity demonstrates, people’s opinions, viewpoints, positions, and preferences commonly evolve and change over time. In the next activities, the students will examine how an individual’s evolving viewpoints influenced American history.\nLEARNING ACTIVITY 1\n1) Have the class brainstorm what they know about Abraham Lincoln. For what is he remembered? What do they know about his life? You may wish to record class responses on the board.\n2) Ask the class to decide which of Lincoln’s actions or decisions have had the most enduring impact on American history? Guide your students to realize that two of Lincoln’s most significant contributions to American history are a) the abolition of slavery and b) the saving of the Union.\n3) Review the major events and activities pertaining to the abolition of slavery during Lincoln’s lifetime – specifically highlighting the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 and the subsequent passage of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution (signed by Lincoln in 1865).\n4) During Lincoln’s lifetime, there were numerous different viewpoints and attitudes toward slavery. There were many critics of slavery’s abolition. The students will next examine a variety of historical quotations from Lincoln and others who lived at the same time, illustrating a wide variety of perspectives.\n5) Divide the students into pairs. Distribute the “Who Said It?” Student Organizer to each pair. Ask the students to identify the speaker of each quote. Some individuals may be associated with more than one quote. This is not a quiz and students will not be graded, however, they should use the information and clues presented in the quotes, as well as their knowledge of history, to make their best guess as to each quote’s speaker or writer.\n6) Once the students have completed the organizer, review each quote one at a time. Poll the class on their guesses for the speaker/writer of each quote and record the most popular answer on the board. Once you’ve tallied all the student answers, reveal the actual speakers and writers, from the provided Answer Key. Ask the students if there were any surprises, and point out some of the unexpected associations (Confederate leaders who spoke against slavery, racism in the quotes by abolitionists, and Lincoln’s varied and conflicting viewpoints on slavery and race).\n7) Ask the students to circle all the quotes from Abraham Lincoln. Do all these quotations agree with each other? Gather student opinions on why the quotes might be so different. The students will next view video segments from the PBS film Looking for Lincoln to determine how Lincoln’s views on slavery evolved over the course of his lifetime.\nLEARNING ACTIVITY 2\n1) Distribute the “Looking for Lincoln’s Views on Slavery Video Organizer” to each student. Frame the upcoming video segments by explaining they show Lincoln’s changing views on slavery.\n2) Provide your students with a FOCUS FOR MEDIA INTERACTION, asking them to watch each video segment, note facts they learn about Lincoln’s views on slavery in the second column of their organizer, and write a complete-sentence summary of Lincoln’s viewpoint as expressed in each video segment in the third column.\n3) Play Video Segment #1, “Early Views,” for your students. (Access the video segments for this lesson at the Video Segments Page). After the segment, give your students a few minutes to complete section 1 of the organizer. Ask your students what facts they learned about Lincoln’s views on slavery early in his administration (refer to the “Looking for Lincoln’s Views on Slavery Video Organizer Answer Key” for possible student answers).\n4) Frame the second segment: since his death, Lincoln has served a symbolic role in American history as the liberator of slaves. As we saw in the first video segment, Lincoln’s views on slavery were a bit more complex, and subject to changing interpretations over the years. In this segment, the students will see how different African Americans have regarded Lincoln’s attitudes towards slavery and race.\n5) Remind students to complete section 2 of the organizer as they watch the segment. Play Video Segment #2, “White Supremacist?” for your students. (Access the video segments for this lesson at the Video Segments Page). After giving your students a few minutes, review their answers.\n6) Ask students why Lincoln might have changed his views on ending slavery. What do they think was the decisive factor in the creation of the Emancipation Proclamation? Play Video Segment #3, “The Road to Emancipation.” (Access the video segments for this lesson at the Video Segments Page). After the segment has finished, give your students a few minutes to complete section 3.\n7) Explain to the students that between 1862-1865, Lincoln’s views on slavery and race had greatly changed. Play Video Segment #4, “Growth and Change.” (Access the video segments for this lesson at the Video Segments Page). After the segment has finished, allow your students to complete section 4 of the organizer.\n8) As a follow-up to the viewing of the video segments, review with your students what they’ve learned about Lincoln’s changing views on slavery and race. Ask your students if they think it is better to maintain one viewpoint or perspective, or to allow your viewpoints and perspectives to change and grow as you gain experience and knowledge. Remind students that recent politicians have been referred to as “flip floppers” when they change their opinions on key topics. Would Lincoln be viewed as a “flip flopper” if he was alive today? Why or why not? How has learning about Lincoln’s changing views on slavery influenced your ideas about politicians who change their minds or shift their viewpoints?\nLEARNING ACTIVITY 3\n1) Project the “Lincoln Over Time” timeline interactive. Provide the students with a focus: based on their knowledge so far, the class will try to place six different quotations Lincoln made about race and slavery in the correct chronological order. As a class, go through the “Lincoln’s Views on Slavery” section of the interactive. Point out to students that Lincoln’s views did not progress in a clear evolution towards emancipation – his progression toward freeing the slaves took many twists and turns.\n2) Once the “Lincoln’s Views on Slavery” section has been completed, direct the students to computers, where they will complete the other sections of the timeline in small groups. Provide them with a focus, asking them to think about how Lincoln changed physically, professionally, and morally during his lifetime.\n3) Once everyone has completed all sections of the timeline, hold a discussion in class about some of the changes Lincoln underwent in his lifetime – professionally, physically, and morally.\n1) Write the following two quotations on the board:\n• “You can’t defend Abraham Lincoln without defending slavery.” – Lerone Bennett\n• “Remembering is always about some degree of forgetting…The task is to keep reminding ourselves what is worth remembering.” – David Blight\n2) Remind the students that these are statements made by two historians featured in LOOKING FOR LINCOLN (both are drawn from Segment 2, “White Supremacist?”). Ask the students what they think each historian meant in his statement (Lerone Bennett is disillusioned with the vision of Lincoln as the “Great Emancipator,” and feels that Lincoln’s views on racial inequality and his inactivity during the abolitionist period should be remembered. David Blight’s statement acknowledges the conflicting views Lincoln held on the slavery issue, but suggests that his early views might not be as important a legacy as his later actions to free the slaves).\n3) Assign your students the following task:\n• Choose one of the two quotations on the board around which to frame a position paper. Using your chosen quote as a frame, write a 1-2 page essay supporting a position on how Abraham Lincoln’s views on slavery should be remembered today.\n• In your essay, be sure to include a comprehensive discussion of Lincoln’s changing and conflicting views on slavery. Incorporate a minimum of three concrete examples supporting your position, such as quotations made by Lincoln (from the “Who said it” or timeline activities), events during Lincoln’s lifetime (from the timeline or video segments), and/or other facts about Lincoln you have learned from the activities completed in this lesson.\n4) If desired, you may direct students to conduct further research into Lincoln’s views on slavery prior to completing their assignment. Two useful sources of documents pertaining to Lincoln and slavery are below.\nAbraham Lincoln Papers at the Library of Congress\n[Note – entering terms such as “free slave” into the keyword will help refine the students’ search]\n5) Collect the students’ position papers for an assessment of the lesson.\nLesson plans for LOOKING FOR LINCOLN were created by the LAB@Thirteen, Thirteen’s Community and Educational Outreach Department.']	['<urn:uuid:72249fbe-444a-4b72-b9fe-8b74b987ec1a>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	6	42	1823
71	Which needs more regular upkeep: steel or fiberglass boats?	Steel boats require more regular upkeep than fiberglass boats. Steel ships need systematic protection through regular painting, inspection and repair of protective coatings, and replacement of sacrificial anodes to prevent corrosion. While fiberglass boats do need maintenance, it is much less intensive, mainly requiring protection from algae growth, regular waxing, and monitoring for cracks or water damage.	"[""Year upon year the cost of marine corrosion has increased until it is estimated today at 4 % of the Gross National Product. An enlightened approach to materials selection, protection and corrosion control is needed to reduce this burden of wasted materials, wasted energy and wasted money. These notes have been compiled by Members of the Marine Corrosion Forum to help marine designers, engineers, and equipment users, understand the causes of marine corrosion and the way in which protective systems and more resistant materials can be used to reduce or entirely eliminate sea water corrosion problems.\nMany different types of destructive attack can occur to structures, ships and other equipment used in sea water service. The term 'aqueous corrosion' describes the majority of the most troublesome problems encountered in contact with sea water, but atmospheric corrosion of metals exposed on or near coastlines, and hot salt corrosion in engines operating at sea or taking in salt-laden air are equally problematical and like aqueous corrosion require a systematic approach to eliminate or manage them.\nCorrosion by sea water, aqueous corrosion, is an electrochemical process, and all metals and alloys when in contact with sea water have a specific electrical potential (or corrosion potential) at a specific level of sea water acidity or alkalinity - the pH.\nThis typical diagram shows the regions where the metal will freely corrode; the region of passivation where stable oxide or other films form and the corrosion process is stifled; the region of pitting corrosion where the corrosion potential of the metal exceeds that of its oxide; and the region of immunity where the metal is normally fully safe to use. More resistant alloys mean less corrosion, metals like gold platinum and tantalum can resist virtually all corrosion, but for marine service the final choice will always be a compromise with cost.\nMost corrosion resistant metals rely on an oxide film to provide protection against corrosion. If the oxide is tightly adherent, stable and self healing, as on many stainless steels and titanium, then the metal will be highly resistant or immune to corrosion. If the film is loose, powdery, easily damaged and non self repairing, such as rust on steel, then corrosion will continue unchecked. Even so, the most stable oxides may be attacked when aggressive concentrations of hydrochloric acid are formed in chloride environments.\nSea water, by virtue of its chloride content, is a most efficient electrolyte. The omni-presence of oxygen in marine atmospheres, sea spray and splash zones at the water-line, and sometimes surprisingly at much greater depths, increases the aggressiveness of salt attack. The differential concentration of oxygen dissolved at the waterline or in a droplet of salt spray creates a cell in which attack is concentrated where the oxygen concentration is lowest. Crevices which allow ingress of water and chlorides but from which oxygen is excluded rapidly become anodic and acidic and are hidden start points of corrosion.\nThere are five main methods for controlling the tendency of metals to corrode in sea water:\nUse of non metallic materials including composites may offer a solution for some applications.\nSea water, if not destructive enough on its own, has several powerful allies assisting the breakdown of metals and non metals alike. Living allies in sea water also enhance its destructive power. Microbiological organisms, clusterings of weed, limpets as well as deposits of sand, silt or slime not only exclude oxygen but often create locally corrosive conditions under these deposits which aggravate attack. Coatings and composite structures can experience rapid degradation. Sulphate reducing bacteria, left undisturbed in marine silt or mud deposits, will produce concentrations of hydrogen sulphide which are particularly aggressive to steel and copper based alloys.\nPitting attack in stagnant sea water may be as much a problem as impingement, erosion or cavitation attack at higher velocities. The highest water velocities, at the tips of propellers or in pumps can result in bubbles of entrained air imploding with sufficient energy to remove metal or break up composites. Called cavitation, this noisy and aggressive mechanical destruction must be corrected by design, or if it cannot be eliminated, countered by the selection of suitably resistant alloys.\nHigh levels of stress in service, or residual stress from manufacturing may result in selective corrosion of more highly stressed regions of an otherwise corrosion resistant structure. In the aggressive marine environment even the more resistant alloys may be affected by hydrogen-induced cracking, or by chloride or sulphide stress corrosion cracking. Choosing the right material for corrosion resistance also requires careful attention to component design, selection of manufacturing processes, installation and operation.\nLet's now look at a simple example. A ship made from bare mild steel will quickly rust.\nProtection by painting\nPainting the ship isolates the steel from the corrosive media. The paint must also be resistant to the marine environment and the application strictly controlled to ensure full and effective coverage of the steel. Regular inspection and repair of the coating may be necessary to achieve reliable and lasting protection.\nSacrificial anodes enable the potential of the system to be changed and will provide temporary protection to steel exposed by wear or damage of the protective coating. Systematic location of the anodes is critical to their overall effectiveness. They must likewise be regularly serviced and replaced when spent.\nInside the ship inhibitors which modify the corrosion process may effectively prevent attack in bilges and other areas where sea water will collect and stagnate. Reliable systems to monitor and maintain the correct concentration of the inhibitor are an essential aspect of this prevention strategy.\nIn practice ships are rarely made just from a single metal or alloy. Modern engineering systems use a wide range composites and of metals and alloys, some more, some less resistant to marine corrosion than steel. The more resistant alloys may aggravate the attack on adjacent unprotected less resistant alloys. This galvanic effect is not always confined to separate metals, some alloys improperly processed in manufacture or fabrication carry the seeds of their own destruction in their microstructures which contain phases so widely separated in corrosion potential that without further overall protection by coating, anodes or inhibitors, selective attack of the less resistant phase is inevitable.\nUsing corrosion resistant alloys\nCould ships and other marine structures be made from more corrosion resistant materials? Depending on design factors including the severity of the application and the levels of strength, damage tolerance, reliability, safety and life required, components and systems can be manufactured from composites, or from stainless steels of increasing resistance, or from copper based alloys such as cupro-nickel or nickel aluminium bronze, nickel alloys or titanium, using these materials exclusively or in conjunction with each other or less resistant alloys. Protection for the least resistant alloys by anodes, or impressed potential, requires careful control of the system potential to avoid the possibility of hydrogen uptake by the more highly corrosion resistant alloys such as super duplex steel and titanium.\nKey factors in prevention of marine corrosion are design, selection of materials, construction, use and maintenance. Failings in any one of these may lead to a total failure to prevent attack, which once started may cost far more to correct or eliminate than any notional savings on materials achieved at the outset. In a recent survey corrosion was found to be responsible for 30% of failures on ships and other marine equipment. These are expensive errors arising from the selection and use of unsuitable materials and are compounded by ever increasing penalties on vessels, civil and military for breakdown and unnecessarily short intervals between outages for major repairs. On offshore platforms the cost penalty for replacement of failed equipment is several times that required for a similar onshore facility, and this does not take into account any losses of oil or gas production.\nWhere to get help\nThe many types of marine corrosion, their possible interaction, and the need to review the whole system when considering changes, means that getting help and advice from marine corrosion specialists and materials and coatings experts is particularly important. Members of the Marine Corrosion Forum include such specialists as well as product and systems suppliers and end users. Regular meetings review and update the wide range of options available to designers and users to overcome new or long term marine corrosion problems. You are welcome to attend a meeting as a guest, or to become a member of the Marine Corrosion Forum yourself."", 'Fiberglass is currently the most common material used to craft small recreational boats and other watercraft.\nChances are, if you have purchased a recreational boat, it is made of fiberglass, also known as Glass Reinforced Plastic or GRP.\nIn this article, we will look at how long fiberglass boats last and the factors that impact fiberglass boats’ durability.\nHow Long Do Fiberglass Boats Typically last?\nFiberglass boats can be sound and seaworthy for up to fifty years or more. Fiberglass is very durable, and with proper maintenance and care, fiberglass boats can last for many decades.\nFiberglass itself will not break down but instead will break down due to outside factors.\nSome factors that will affect break down are:\n- Exposure to UV rays\n- Fatigue from movement\n- Water saturation\n- Salt from seawater.\nToo much UV rays can cause the fiberglass to become more brittle. Because most boating happens during sunny weather conditions, this is a highly probable issue.\nWater saturation can cause a breakdown between the fiberglass and the resin. This is most often caused by acid formation with the water and products hidden in the fiberglass.\nSalt from saltwater can move between the fiberglass and become deposited in the fiberglass’s larger porous areas. This causes the salt to add to the pressure on the fiberglass.\nOne final issue could be poor production at the beginning of the boat’s life. This is hard to combat, and you will want to ensure you purchase a high-quality boat.\nOne of the biggest issues you will encounter with your fiberglass boat is the other components. Your fiberglass is much more likely to last than your other structural, engine, and electrical components.\n3 Factors That Impact The Durability Of Fiberglass Boats\nSo, what if you already have a fiberglass boat?\nYou’re probably thinking: what should I look out for?\nThe main things you want to look for in your fiberglass are:\n- Small cracks\n- Water damage\n1) Small Cracks\nTo find aging damage, you will want to look for microscopic cracks.\nAt first, they might seem minor, almost hairline. These cracks should not be ignored as they can get bigger with time—the bigger the cracks, the more pressure is applied to the fiberglass’s structure and integrity.\nThis break in the integrity of the fiberglass can further compromise the structure of your vessel. For this reason, fiberglass boat owners need to monitor their boats for cracks constantly.\nWhen cracks are found, they need to be dealt with and filled in.\nFiberglass can also experience fatigue.\nVibration and impact on the fiberglass can cause stress and fatigue. Repetitive waves, engine vibrations, and other activities can cause strain on the fiberglass.\nAfter a certain amount of time, fiberglass can also get worn down. Without proper care, the fiberglass can become weak and brittle.\n3) Water Damage\nYou need to ensure your fiberglass is not experiencing water damage.\nWhile the resin itself is waterproof, if water gets in, it can damage the fiberglass. Eventually, after enough water is absorbed, the damage will apply more and more pressure, which can cause wear, blistering, and cracking.\nThe part of the boat that is most susceptible to this damage is the part of the hull that is below the waterline.\nThe last thing to look out for is heat and sun damage.\nWith enough heat and UV rays, the fiberglass in the hull can become rigid and brittle. This can even cause warping.\nOne major issue with a fiberglass hull is that warping or major damage to the fiberglass itself can be challenging and expensive to repair.\nAs previously expressed, if you own an older boat, your main issue is most likely not in the fiberglass. That doesn’t mean that you should not need maintenance and monitor your fiberglass. Vigilance, maintenance, and preventative care are the best way to maintain your fiberglass’s structural integrity.\nHow To Prolong The Life Of Fiberglass Boats\nSome people will try to tell you that your fiberglass “does not need maintenance.”\nThis is not true.\nCompared to other types of boats, especially wooden boats, fiberglass is much less maintenance. This does not mean that there is no maintenance involved, and you must keep up with it.\nMost importantly, when maintaining your boat, you need to protect the bottom constantly exposed to water.\nIf your boat is left in the water for even a few days, you will want to attempt to protect it from algae and other growth. To prevent this, there are certain protectants and bottom paints you can apply.\nYou will want to ensure whatever growth repellent you purchase works for the area and body of water you plan on having your boat in. Before application, you will want to make sure to properly sand or otherwise prepare your fiberglass.\nThe area between the railing and the waterline needs to have regular maintenance done because this part of your boat takes on most of the waves, spray, and sun. Without proper care, this area will fade, oxidize, and get hazy. To combat this wear, you need to make sure you keep up the wax on your boat.\nIf waxing becomes a hassle, you can get a buffer. This will enhance the process and make it easier to complete.\nThe deck of a boat also sees a lot of wear. This comes from sun, dirt, grime, spills, and other general wear and tear. The main way to combat this is regular washings and a good stiff brush.\nBe sure never to wash a “non-slip” area with wax. This is highly important on the deck where people walk. Safety should always be your priority.\nBesides this maintenance, you will want to maintain cleanliness on all other aspects of your boat. This will help to keep the condition pristine and avoid aging and wear.\nFinally, no matter what type of boat you own, you will want to maintain the engine properly. You want to make sure you maintain your boat engine constantly.\nThis is true if you use your fiberglass boat every day or only occasionally. If you only use your boat occasionally, you will still want to maintain the engine as if you use it regularly.\nMaintaining your boat engine is like maintaining your vehicle engine. You will want to make sure it is properly oiled fueled, and the boat battery is charged.\nLike a car, keeping a boat’s radio or lights on for a long time can drain a battery and even kill it.\nHow To Spot Aging Signs On Used Fiberglass Boats\nWhen buying an old fiberglass boat, especially a “fixer-upper,” there are some things to keep in mind.\nUnlike wooden trim items, fiberglass boat structural issues are more difficult to repair or restore.\nRestoring a fiberglass hull can be almost impossible, depending on the wear accrued. Because these hulls are made all at once, patching them is your only option if the problem is that simple.\nWooden boats are more maintenance and more difficult to maintain, but they do allow for the replacement of parts by competent and qualified artisans.\nWhen purchasing a used fiberglass boat, you will want to look out for the signs listed above. You will need to know if you are looking at any structural issues.\nMake sure to check for cracks, fading, wear, growth, or damage. Look at the high-stress areas for cracks, wear down, or other signs of damage.\nThe pressure created in the fiberglass can cause issues for you later.\nAs well as fiberglass wear, you will want to make sure that your hull is not chipped, blistered, or starting to flex excessively.\nStress on a fiberglass hull can cause flexing as degradation occurs. This can cause major cracks and severe hull issues.\nIssues found with a boat can be fixed. Based on the extremity of the issue and your experience, you should look for a professional opinion on maintenance and damage restoration. This is important before you buy. Taking on too many issues may quickly make your new boat purchase a headache you never wanted and were not prepared for.\nIf everything is intact with the boat, and you do not see any cracks, warping, mechanical failure, or other issues, it would be safe to purchase the used fiberglass boat.\nIf you keep up with the proper maintenance, a used older fiberglass boat could last you many years to come.\nWhy Do Fiberglass Last So Long?\nFiberglass is a form of plastic that is reinforced using glass fiber. The glass fiber is usually woven into a fabric. This makes the fiberglass superior when it comes to durability.\nFiberglass material is relatively lightweight, extremely durable, and less brittle than standard glass or plastic.\nFiberglass can be easily molded and is often used to make more complex shapes. Standard uses for fiberglass are boats, aircraft, bathtubs, etc.\nFor a boat to be considered a fiberglass boat, the hull, deck, liner, and even large parts of the console are made from fiberglass.\nFiberglass boat construction in a mold first uses a gel coat; fiberglass cloth layers are applied, with resin applied on each layer.\nBefore fiberglass, boats were constructed from bark, wood, animal skin, iron, or steel. Today, larger ships are still constructed from aluminum or steel, while smaller recreational boats are made from fiberglass or GRP.\nFiberglass boat construction was experimented with as early as the late 1930s and is the main manufacturing method.']"	['<urn:uuid:9540ede7-3fd3-4bd6-b15a-073d9bb00532>', '<urn:uuid:e2437e29-1570-448f-98ca-a5b77dbb93e5>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	9	57	2977
72	how hide cracks mud home wall	A dash finish texture is good for hiding cracks. It is applied by tossing or spraying plaster at the wall, creating a rough and raised texture. As long as the base coats are well applied, cracks are hard to see within this finish and don't tend to develop.	['There are a lot of finish plaster texture options available for your straw bale home and knowing which one is best for you can be difficult. The best decisions are based on understanding the combination of application-technical difficulty, personal aesthetics, durability, crack hiding ability, and material availability. I have given a short description for several of the most common finishes below. Some are better suited for interior finishes and others for exterior use. I have not rated them in terms of technical difficulty because that is only relevant if I know the skills of the person completing the work. For example, even the best plastering crews may not be good at a particular finish if it is not something they do very often. I hope this will be a basic guide for you to start your journey in educating yourself on plaster finishes.\nIf you plan to do the work yourself, the biggest suggestion I have is to practice, practice, practice…and NOT on your house. Create a mock wall that you can work on until you feel comfortable. Better yet, once you have finished your work on the mock wall, build a small straw bale structure like the Sunset Cottage that you can practice the entire building process on before you start your main home. Want some hands on experience? We plaster in all of our hands-on, seven-day workshops so click here to see if there is a location and date that works for you. If you plan to hire the work out, be sure to make clear the style of finish you want on the home and then confirm, preferably with references, that the contractor can successfully complete the style you want.\nThis is perhaps the most common finish for a straw bale house exterior. It is basically created by either hand troweling or spraying the finish coat of plaster onto the wall and then smoothing it with a very slightly dampened sponge float. The float smooths the trowel marks and pulls the sand up a bit to give the texture. You can create a fine, medium, or coarse finish depending on the size of sand that you use. This texture does a good job of hiding cracks if the texture is coarse, but less so with a fine finish.\nThis texture is often used on exteriors, but is better suited for interior surfaces where the rough textures of floated finishes are not as good a choice. After all, sanded finishes tend to slough sand for a while after application and that can be a dirty experience inside a home. It tends to show cracks easily and is very difficult to perfect. To achieve this finish, use a pool trowel which is more flexible and has rounded corners.\nThis is a great interior finish as it provides smooth walls while still offering some texture and random patterns that make the overall appearance more interesting. Although I prefer it as an interior finish, I have seen it used on exteriors with success as well. Cat face is created in a two step process. First, a finish coat of about 1/8″ thickness is applied and finished fairly smooth. Before it has a chance to dry, another coat of about 1/8″ thickness is applied and smoothed. The number of inclusions, or depressions in the plaster, is up to the finisher and how smoothly the final plaster is finished. This texture is sometimes called “Green on Green” because is uses two layers of green (fresh) plaster in one application to create the effect.\nThis plaster finish can be applied by one person which makes it appealing for a DIYer. It is applied either by hand with a masonry brush or by spraying the plaster with a hopper sprayer. The mud is actually tossed (or sprayed) at the wall leaving a rough and raised texture. It is a great exterior finish and supplies good coverage for cracks. in other words, cracks are hard to see within this finish and don’t tend to develop, as long as the base coats are well applied. Similar to the Cat Face approach, this finish requires a minimum of two coats, and those are on top of the the scratch and brown coats. This is an example of harling, a traditional plastering technique used in the United Kingdom for hundreds of years, so the longevity of the finish is well established.\nThis finish is relatively easy to complete as it involves finishing the plaster in circular motions with either a steel trowel or plastic trowel. The key to this finish is using round sand. The more coarse that sand, the bigger the “worm tunnels,” which is what gives this texture its name. the finish hides cracks and imperfections well; however, it is often used in commercial applications so it may not have the refined look you are after.']	['<urn:uuid:14fe4a66-ec46-42a4-9807-42c14e35a9dc>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	6	48	809

74	What's the environmental impact of the new subway braking tech?	The braking energy capture system makes the whole transit system more efficient by storing and re-using dissipated braking energy. This leads to reduced power consumption - nearly 20% reduction at the substation - which means less electricity needs to be produced, resulting in fewer emissions and a reduced carbon footprint.	['Getting thousands of tons of steel, plastic and people moving along an underground track clearly takes a lot of energy. Less known, or at least less thought of, is how much energy it takes to stop.\nWhile the high-pitched screech of a subway train coming to a halt is a good indication, the energy produced by brakes on metal isn’t something most would consider could be harnessed and re-purposed.\nAndrew Gillespie is the exception. Mr. Gillespie is the chief engineering officer for Power at the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, or SEPTA, the transit network that moves some 4 million people in and around the Philadelphia metropolitan area.\nWe consume about a half a billion kilowatts of power annually; my electric bill is anywhere from US$38-million to US$42-million\nHe and his colleagues have been intently watching over a test system currently running on a portion of SEPTA’s rail transit line that allows captured energy from one train slowing down to, among other things, propel another train speeding up — a system provided by the Canadian arm of ABB Systems Inc.\n“We consume about a half a billion kilowatts of power annually; my electric bill is anywhere from US$38-million to US$42-million,” says Mr. Gillespie. “This is a technology that makes the whole system more efficient.”\nLike a hybrid car, ABB’s solution is a way for mass transit systems to store and re-use dissipated braking energy as a means of saving money, boosting efficiency, being more environmentally friendly and even making money by selling some of the stored-up energy. Newer trains and streetcars have “regen” capacity built into their braking systems.\nIt’s an innovative project initially conceived in the suburbs of Montreal by Jacques Poulin and a team of engineers at Envitech Energy, a company that had focused its efforts on solar- and wind-generated water treatment technologies but later moved into rail transportation. ABB, a global power and automation technologies firm, acquired Envitech Energy in 2011.\n“It’s an emerging technology that transit providers are starting to consider and explore, because it can pay for itself,” says Mr. Poulin, product manager of energy storage in rail transportation at ABB’s Pointe-Claire, Q.C. facility. “It also helps reduce the carbon footprint.”\nWhile efficient at moving hundreds of people at a time, subways, streetcars and light rail lines aren’t so efficient when it comes to energy consumption. Power consumption has risen significantly in the recent past with cities adding to their transit networks more electric-powered vehicles that include creature comforts like air conditioning.\nThat’s where ABB’s system comes in. Using a wayside, or “beside-the-train-track” energy storage solution, the system detects when a train is braking and the voltage is rising, automatically taking in energy that flows into an 800-kilowatt lithium-ion battery, or sending it back out when it detects another train accelerating.\nIf there isn’t a need for the extra power stored, it can be sold back to the wholesale energy market, or the grid. Most riders wouldn’t notice the equipment, which consists of a large stationary battery housed in a white cargo-sized container, and a smaller grey box beside it that controls the system.\nThanks to energy market de-regulation, U.S. energy providers can buy energy from private producers — companies or even individuals with solar panels or wind turbines, or a public entity like SEPTA. PJM Interconnection, the Eastern regional grid operator, has teamed with SEPTA to buy energy when it needs to balance out electricity supply and demand — and it’s paying off.\nWe’re seeing savings of anywhere between US$12,000 and US$20,000 a month\nSince coming online last April, SEPTA has seen a near 20% reduction in power consumption at the substation, says Mr. Gillespie. The longer-term objective is to bring in $150,000 to $200,000 a year in revenue, giving SEPTA a way to finance the installation of more systems along its network.\n“We’re seeing savings of anywhere between US$12,000 and US$20,000 a month,” he says. “That’s electricity that doesn’t have to be produced, which means more cost savings and equally important, less emissions.”\nOther cities have also begun to sign on for the new technology, including AGP Metro Polska, which runs the metro system in Warsaw, Poland, as well as Montreal’s STM, which in a few weeks will have a test version of ABB’s system up and running on one of its “Arriere Gare” (literally “behind station”) tracks.\nA spokesperson for STM confirmed that the project was underway.\nFor Philadelphia and other cities where the technology may eventually get rolled out, riders won’t notice any difference.\n“They actually won’t notice it at all,” says Mr. Gillespie. “The analogy I use a lot is it is the transit equivalent of a Toyota Prius [except] there’s no room left to put the battery on the train so we put the battery on the wayside instead.”']	['<urn:uuid:983ec903-02cc-4933-9890-5c42bdaf9bfc>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	10	50	799
75	radiocarbon dating carbon14 dating difference	Radiocarbon dating and Carbon-14 dating are actually the same method. It involves measuring radioactive carbon-14 in organisms, which they acquire through the food chain while alive. After death, the carbon-14 begins to decay with a half-life of 5,730 years. This method can only date materials up to around 50,000 years old because carbon-14 decays quickly. The method works by comparing the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in the sample, since the initial ratio is known and remains constant in living organisms.	['Have you ever considered how to calculate the age of a fossil found after years in an archaeological dig? How do we know the age of a human body found in glaciers? The answer of all these questions is Carbon-14 Dating Method. What is Carbon 14 (14C) Dating? How is carbon 14 used dating? How carbon-14 dating works? What is the maximum limit on carbon 14 dating? Is carbon 14 dating reliable? You will find the answers to all these questions in this article.\n- 1 What Is Carbon 14 Dating?\n- 1.1 How is carbon 14 produced and where does it exist naturally?\n- 1.2 What is Carbon 14 Dating Technique?\n- 1.3 What are some examples of radioactive dating?\n- 1.4 In Which Conditions Carbon 14 Method Causes Deviations?\n- 1.5 AMS-Accelarated Mass Spectrometer\n- 1.6 Is Carbon 14 Dating Reliable?\nWhat Is Carbon 14 Dating?\nAmerican Chemist Dr. Willard Libby could never have predicted that his article titled Radiocarbon from Cosmic Radiation, published in Science magazine in 1947, would be such an important breakthrough in the 21st century.\nHe won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1960 with the carbon 14 (radiocarbon) dating method he developed following the period he wrote this article.\nHow is carbon 14 produced and where does it exist naturally?\nCarbon is found in all living things.\nBut there are more than one type of carbon. Most carbon atoms consist of 6 protons and 6 neutrons. This carbon is called Carbon 12. Carbon 12 forms for 98.89% of all carbon on earth (including carbon dioxide in the atmosphere)\nCarbon 14 is unstable element. In order for carbon 14 to form, some chemical events need to take place. The atoms in the air that interact with cosmic lights from space (the vast majority of which come from the sun) emit high-energy neutron particles. These neutrons collide with the highest amount of nitrogen (N) in the air (about 78%), causing a proton release from the nitrogen atoms.\nThe nitrogen atom that gains a neutron and loses a proton is transformed into a Carbon 14 atom.\nCarbon 12 is stable element. Carbon 14 is unstable and combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide.\nPlants take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by photosynthesis and use this carbon dioxide to form organic molecules. Thus, carbon 14 atoms are stored in plants.\nAnimals and humans continue to consume these plants or those who consume these plants and receive the carbon 14 atoms during their lifetime. In other words, because of the food chain, carbon 14 becomes present in the structure of all living things.\nCarbon 12, Carbon 13 and Carbon 14 atoms are isotope atoms. Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons, but differing numbers of neutrons. In other words, the have different atomic weights.\nSo isotopes are different forms of a single element.\nWhat is Carbon 14 Dating Technique?\nIt is a dating method made by using the half-life of carbon 14 atoms because the carbon 14 atoms found in all living thing work like a nuclear clock.\nAs long as living things are alive, they get carbon 14 through the food chain. When they die, the intake of carbon 14 from outside stops and over time the amount of carbon 14 in the body begins to decrease.\nWhat is the radioactive half-life of Carbon 14?\nThe radioactive half-life of carbon 14 is 5730 years. In other words, 5730 years after the death of a living thing, the amount of carbon 14 in his body is halved.\nWe can modeling the carbon 14 dating, with an hourglass. Let’s suppose that all of the sand at the top of the hourglass is carbon 14 atoms.\nWhen we turn the hourglass, if we know how much sand is initially in the upper part and how much sand goes into the lower compartment, we can calculate at any time how much time has passed since we turned the clock.\nIf we know the initial amount of carbon 14 and that amount will be halved in 5730 years, we can also calculate how much time has passed since the creature’s death.\nSo how do we know the initial amount of carbon 14?\nHere is the amount of carbon 12 helps us find the answer to this question. Even if livings die, the amount of carbon 12 in their bodies remains constant. In addition, since the ratio of carbon 14 to carbon 12 in livings is constant, we can determine the amount of carbon 14 initially.\nWhat is the maximum limit on carbon 14 dating?\nThe maximum date for carbon 14 is up to 50.000 years with the current technology. Age determination by carbon 14 analysis is called radiocarbon dating.\nAlthough this limit is mentioned as 60.000 years in the literature, it is the age limit found as a result of special research rather than the age limit reached in standard practices.\nIn Carbon 14 laboratories, Carbon 14 dating has been dated to the oldest 43,000-50,000 years ago. Carbon 14 dating does not give us exactly age. It gives us a age range. In technology that develops so fast, in the future, very accurate measurements can be made, and perhaps very close to the actual age.\nWhat are some examples of radioactive dating?\nThe dating of Göbeklitepe‘s (Çatalhöyük) and many other settlements in Anatolia (Turkey), which is the greatest discovery in the field of archeology in recent years and shed light on the history of mankind, was performed with carbon 14 test.\nMany Byzantine antiquity were found during excavations around Istanbul-Yenikapı as part of the Marmaray project and this event excited archaeologists. The excitement of the archaeologists was the result of the carbon 14 dating method. While the known date of Istanbul was 2,500 years, it was understood that it was 8,500 years with the archaeological excavations carried out in Marmaray project.\nIn 1991, two German climbers discovered the human body (called Iceman Otzi because of its presence in the glaciers) in the Tisenjoch region of the Alpine mountains on the Italian-Austrian border, and the age of the human body was determined by carbon 14 dating methods.\nIt was determined that there was a human being who lived approximately 3370-3100 BC.\nThe oldest known snowshoe was found in the same area in 2003. It was determined by the carbon 14 method that this shoe is approximately 5800 years old.\nIn Which Conditions Carbon 14 Method Causes Deviations?\nAs a result of some natural phenomena, the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 14 which is constant may change. An example of this is the release of carbon dioxide containing large amounts of carbon 12 into the atmosphere as a result of volcano eruptions. Due to the abundant amount of carbon 12 released into the atmosphere, the carbon 14-carbon 12 ratio will affect, so age estimates in these areas can be based on earlier dates.\nAnother phenomenon that causes deviations of ratio carbon 14 / carbon 12 is solar flares. As a result of these explosions, the cosmic rays reaching the atmosphere increase the carbon 14 level.\nOne of the biggest factors affecting the carbon 14 carbon 12 ratio in the world is the nuclear weapons tests that started in the 1950s. Because of these nuclear weapons tests, the carbon 14 level in those years increased to about 2 times the natural level.\nThis unnatural increase in carbon 14 levels after 1955 caused serious uncertainty about dating at the time.\nWhat is Suess Effect?\nApart from natural deviations, deviations can also occur due to human. The Suess Effect is a term which has come to signify the decrease in Carbon 14 in atmospheric carbon dioxide owing to admixture of carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of fossil fuels.\nAMS-Accelarated Mass Spectrometer\nThe first carbon 14 dating laboratory was opened in the 1950s. With technological developments, measurement methods developed and the introduction of AMS-Accelarated Mass Spectrometer in some universities began a new era in the carbon 14 dating method.\nMeasurements with AMS showed that samples weighing milligrams were sufficient. This made it possible to date ants, pollen, even seeds with the carbon 14 method.\nBecause this test can be done with very small samples, the age of the priceless historical work is now easily dated.\nIs Carbon 14 Dating Reliable?\nOne of the most important evidence that age determination with carbon 14 is a scientifically valid method is the results from tree analysis.\nTrees produce a growth ring every year. With these growth rings, we can all guess how the age of the trees is calculated by looking at the trunk of a cut or broken tree.\nThis simple method, known by everyone, tested the carbon 14 dating method with trees that are known its age.\nPlease write your comments, suggestions and questions in to the comments section about this article.', 'But how is it dated? What does radiometric dating actually mean? And what methods of dating can be used to date which kinds of items?\nWhat is radiometric dating?\nRadiometric dating is a method of establishing how old something is – perhaps a wooden artefact, a rock, or a fossil – based on the presence of a radioactive isotope within it.\nThe basic logic behind radiometric dating is that if you compare the presence of a radioactive isotope within a sample to its known abundance on Earth, and its known half-life (its rate of decay), you can calculate the age of the sample.\nRadiometric dating is useful for finding the age of ancient things, because many radioactive materials decay at a slow rate.\nWhat is radioactive decay?\nRadioactive atoms are unstable, meaning they decay into “daughter” products. The number of protons or neutrons in the atom changes, leading to a different isotope or element. The time it takes for one half of the atoms to have decayed is referred to as a “half-life”.\nWe know the half-lives of the radioactive isotopes found on Earth, and so we can trace how long a radioactive material within an object has been decaying for, and therefore how long (within a range of error) it’s been since the object was formed.\nSome radioactive materials decay into daughter products that are also radioactive, and have their own half-life: the result is called a “decay-chain”, which eventually decays into a non-radioactive substance.\nTypes of radiometric dating\nRadiocarbon (14C) dating\nYou’ve almost definitely heard of “carbon dating”. It’s a very common method used mostly by archaeologists, because it can only date relatively recent materials.\nRadiocarbon dating is possible because all living things take in carbon from their environment, which includes a small amount of the radioactive isotope 14C, formed from cosmic rays bombarding nitrogen-14.\nWhen an animal or plant dies, it will not take in any more carbon, and the 14C present will begin to decay. We can thus measure how long it’s been since the animal or plant died by comparing the presence of 14C with the known half-life.\nThis can raise complexities in archaeology when, for example, a society uses a piece of wood that was felled hundreds of years prior. There are also issues because the rate of cosmic ray bombardment of the planet over time has not always been stable: but this problem is largely redressed by a calibration factor.\nRadiocarbon dating is not suitable for dating anything older than around 50,000 years, because 14C decays quickly (its half-life is 5,730 years) and so will not be present in significant enough amounts in older objects to be measurable.\nRadiocarbon dating identified Ötzi, the Italian-Alps Iceman, as a 5,300-year-old traveller. More recently, Australian scientists used radiocarbon dating to figure out the age of wasp nests in rock art, and thereby establishing a date range for the art.\nPotassium-argon and argon-argon dating\nPotassium-argon dating is a method that allows us to calculate the age of a rock, or how long ago it was formed, by measuring the ratio of radioactive argon to radioactive potassium within it.\nRadioactive potassium (40K – a solid) decays to radioactive argon (40Ar – a gas), at a known rate. When volcanic rocks are formed and cooled, all argon within the rock is released into the atmosphere, and when the rock hardens, none can re-enter.\nThis means that any argon present in a volcanic rock must have been produced by the decay of radioactive potassium, so measuring the ratio can enable a scientist to date the sample.\nThis method is limited, because it’s only applicable to volcanic rocks, but is useful for older archaeology because it has a date range of about 4.3 billion to 100,000 years ago.\nHowever, there are potential issues with potassium-argon dating. For example, deep-sea basalts retain some argon after formation due to high hydrostatic pressure, and other rocks may incorporate older “argon-rich” material during formation.\nArgon-argon dating is an updated method, based on the original K-Ar dating technique, that uses neutron irradiation from a nuclear reactor to convert a stable form of potassium into the argon isotope 39Ar, and then measures the ratio of 40Ar to 39Ar.\nArgon-argon dating was used to determine that the Australopithecus Lucy, who rewrote our understanding of early hominin evolution, lived around 3.18 million years ago.\nThis technique involves measuring the ratio of uranium isotopes (238U or 235U) to stable lead isotopes 206Pb, 207Pb and 208Pb. It can be used to determine ages from 4.5 billion years old to 1 million years old. This method is thought to be particularly accurate, with an error-margin that can be less than two million years – not bad in a time span of billions.\nU-Pb dating can be used to date very old rocks, and has its own in-built cross-checking system, since the ratio of 235U to 207Pb and 238U to 206Pb can be compared using a “concordia diagram”, in which samples are plotted along a straight line that intersects the curve at the age of the sample.\nU-Pb dating is most often done on igneous rocks containing zircon. It’s been used to determine the age of ancient hominids, along with fission-track dating.\nThis method involves examining the polished surface of a slice of rock, and calculating the density of markings – or “tracks” – left in it by the spontaneous fission of 238U impurities.\nThe uranium content of the sample must be known; this can be determined by placing a plastic film over the polished slice and bombarding it with slow neutrons – neutrons with low kinetic energy. This bombardment produces new tracks, the quantity of which can be compared with the quantity of original tracks to determine the age.\nThis method can date naturally occurring minerals and man-made glasses. It can thus be used for very old samples, like meteorites, and very young samples, like archaeological artefacts.\nFission-track dating identified that the Brahin Pallasite, a meteorite found in the 19th century in Belarus – slabs of which have become a collectors item – underwent its last intensive thermal event 4.26–4.2 billion years ago.\nThis method involves calculating the prevalence of the very rare isotope chlorine-36 (36Cl), which can be produced in the atmosphere through cosmic rays bombarding argon atoms. It’s used to date very old groundwater, from between around 100,000 and 1 million years old.\nChlorine-36 was also released in abundance during the detonation of nuclear weapons between 1952 and 1958. It stays in the atmosphere for about a week, and so can mark young groundwater from the 1950s onwards as well.\nLuminescence dating methods are not technically radiometric, since they don’t involve calculating ratios of radioactive isotopes. However, they do use radioactive material.\nThese methods date crystalline materials to the last time they were heated – whether by human-made fires or sunlight.\nThis is possible because mineral grains in sediments absorb ionising radiation over time, which charges the grains in “electron traps”. Exposure to sunlight or heat releases these, removing the charges from the sample.\nThe material is stimulated using light (optically stimulated luminescence) or heat (thermoluninescence), which causes a signal to be released from the object, the intensity of which can provide a measure of how much radiation was absorbed after the burial of the material – if you know the amount of background radiation at the burial site.\nThis method can date archaeological materials, such as ceramics, and minerals, like lava flows and limestones. It has a normal range of a few decades to 100,000 years old, but some studies have used it to identify much older things.\nOther types of radiometric dating\nThere are several other radioactive isotopes whose ratios can be measured to date rocks, including samarium-neodymium, rubidium-strontium, and uranium-thorium. Each of these have their own advantages and idiosyncrasies, but they rely on the same logic of radioactivity to work.\nThe Royal Institution of Australia has an Education resource based on this article.

76	I'm interested in ancient Egyptian gardening and heard they considered some trees sacred. Can you tell me about the significance of the sycamore tree in their culture?	The sycamore tree (Ficus sycomorus) had special religious significance in ancient Egypt. In funeral texts, sycamores were associated with sunrise, with two turquoise sycamores framing the eastern horizon where the sun rises daily. The tree was connected to the goddess Hathor, who was known as Mistress of the Sycamore. The sky goddess Nut was also associated with sycamores in funerary texts. These trees were believed to provide protection, shade, and nourishment for the deceased.	"['Theban Tomb No. 41 is located between el-Khokha and Sheikh Abd el-Qurna, near the home of Davies (). It is of great theological importance, for it includes, besides the usual prayers and addresses to the gods, many texts of hymns, almost all of which have been published by Assmann.\nThe pictorial representations are however difficult to see, even after modern restoration and cleaning. The uninviting appearance of the monument says that it was abandoned for a long time.\nOne of the important points in the theme of the Ramesside tombs is the worship of the gods by different persons presented in the decor. The chapel is thus sanctified, becomes a place of pilgrimage and provides information on the closeness of the deceased with his gods. Besides this, the tomb continues to exercise its three traditional functions: a resting place for the body, where worship takes place and a place of remembrance. The dominant theme in the decor of this tomb is that of funerals: they are represented by three different versions that complement one another. Incidentally, many rites, although still included in the decor, had probably been no longer practiced for some time.\nIn the absence of any reference to a ruler, the tomb has been dated to the period of Horemheb - Seti I (1323-1279 ± dating by Ian Shaw.) on stylistic and architectural criteria, as well as the iconographic and epigraphic schemes.\nBankes travelled to Egypt from 1815 to 1819. It is not known if he visited the tomb, but he purchased the stone sarcophagus of Amenemopet and brought it back with him to England. It is currently in the garden of castle, in the Dorset.\nBefore 1821, Cailliaud visited the tomb and copied virtually all the now destroyed scenes, including scenes of making tomb equipment. Burton made exact copies with the help of a camera lucida (for details, see camera lucida in ).\nWilkinson in 1821-1833, Champollion in 1829, Rosellini in 1829, Prisse d\'Avenne after 1830 and Lepsius in 1844, all copied some scenes and names. Between 1820 and 1920 massive destruction took place, as Davies noted in his notebooks. Cleaning work has shown that this destruction was due to use of the premises as stables as well as fires. However, in the Ptolemaic era two intrusive burials had already caused destruction of the decor.\nThe 1920s saw the installation of a metal gate and the first restoration.\nUnder the auspices of the Ramessidische Beamtengräber in der Thebanischen Nekropole (Tombs of Ramesside officials in the Theban Necropolis), Jan Assmann led five campaigns of restoration and cleaning between 1979 and 1984 during which TT41 was studied and documented: ""Das Grab des Amenemope (TT 41)"", Theben III, Mainz 1991.\nThe tomb was then properly restored and opened to the public ().\nThe following presentation is based on the results of Assmann\'s work.\nDuring these campaigns, small objects, ceramics and notably four coffins were found in two alcoves attached to the funeral shaft No 2. This shaft, whose entrance is located in the northwest corner of the courtyard, near the northern colonnade, was certainly a part from the beginning of the funeral complex. These burials - which are not usurpations - are contemporary, but their relationship linking the deceased to Amenemopet is unclear; the last burial took place shortly after the death of Amenemopet as from the reign of Ramses II, the coffins had changed their shape. Two of the coffins have names,\n""Lady of the House, Hel"" and\n""Chief-Sena of Amun Nekhunefer""; this latter title, which roughly corresponds to ""Head of the security service"", is known from the 11th to the 26th Dynasty.\nThe plan of the TT 41 is a conventional type for the New Kingdom tombs at Thebes, one of a inverted ""T"", with a transverse hall crossing a longitudinal passage – a chapel ( and ). This basic layout, however, changes its emphasis between the time of Amenhotep III and that of Ramses II, when changes appear. Thus TT41 has a sunken courtyard () which was reached by a flight of thirteen steps to the east, now covered with wooden steps () ; in the time of Amenemopet, the court played an important ritual role. Columns and pillars existed in tombs of (TT192), at Nefersekheru (TT107) and other officials at the time of Amenhotep III. At the same time, we should also mention the tomb TT57 of Khaemhat whose cross shaped chapel, has three niches with statues copied from those of Amenemopet. TT41 has probably served as a model for relatives tombs, as with TT23 (Tjay) or TT106 (Paser).\nIn these periods of innovation, one sees new structures: the ""sloping passageway"" (made by rotating its descent) associated with bent corridors. These developments are related to sacred funerary thinking and with establishing a relationship between the tomb and the path of the sun. In addition different parts of the tomb are now considered to belong to the underworld, ""a rock tomb with access to the world of the hereafter, "" as Assmann said.\nIn this type of tomb, chapel halls are decorated, while underground corridors, annexes, and the sarcophagus room are not. This room was (as in other tombs) blocked by a stone wall that is still in place. Finally, note that some surface structures belonging to the monument may have disappeared.\nAmong the many titles of Amenemopet, those who appear most often are\n""royal scribe"" and\n""Chief administrator of the domain of Amun"". This title is very important and it confers up to the Eighteenth Dynasty, as much influence as the vizier. Its importance decreases gradually during the rest of the Ramesside period but increases again afterwards.\nHis wife is Nedjmet\n""singer of Amun"", a title usually held by wives of high officials. This function is performed only occasionally and these women have no fixed position in the temple.\nThe father of Amenemopet is called Nefertiu and bears the title\n""judge""; his mother, Iny, is a\n""singer of the Theban triad"".\nA staircase leads to a sunken courtyard which measures 10.50 x 9.45m (excluding pillars). Of the three aisles of pillars provided, only the southern, consisting of five Osirid pillars, was completed;\nthe northern one is partially completed () and the eastern one is in draft form. The west wall is that of the front of the tomb.\nThe court was definitely used for the practice of rites, which could well take place in the open air but still in privacy. Among these rites, there are the latter stages of the Ritual of the Opening of the Mouth, the Litanies of the Sun, but also\n""the rite of digging the earth, "" which is related to Sokar, and the incensing of a vegetable mummiform shape. The term ""vegetable Osiris"" refers to a clay mould, the shape of the god Osiris, which can appear as a flat plant growing surface ( and ) or as a small wooden box, as in Tutankhamun\'s tomb, and which evokes the mythical tree overlooking the tomb of Osiris. Sown in this earth, the green shoots that spring up are a magical aid for the resurrection of the God and the Deceased, since it has became an Osiris too.\nThe Osirid pillars on the south side are 1.90m high and represent the deceased.\nThe first two are unfinished (); the pillars 3-5 are built on the usual Osirid pattern (): arms crossed on his chest, right hand clutching a Djed (duration, and stability, which have became an amulet) while the left hand holds a Isis knot (protective symbol). Under the crossed arms is a column of text that goes down to the feet.\nThis is the best preserved and it retains some of its original colours (); on its back face, we see a few traces of black sketch. The inscription of the statue itself, like that of the fourth pillar proclaims that the deceased enjoys everything that comes from the offering table of Amun, that he will be a satisfied deceased and his name is beautiful and will last for eternity.\nThis has on its side some traces of the clothing and feet of the seated deceased. Below, we recognize two upright standing mummies, placed thus for the performance of burial rites. To the far left a priest pours water into a container held by another kneeling priest (). Two couples are moving to the left, hands raised as is usual when praying. Before them, three kneeling priests make gestures of rejoicing. On the east and south faces, representations of the deceased are not visible. Finally below, we come down to the silhouettes of musicians and singers.\nIn the inscription, which runs to the left around the fifth pillar, there is not just\n""the chief administrator of the estate, Amenemopet"" who is cited, but also\n""his sister (= wife), Lady of the House and singer of Amun, Nodjmet"" while in the inscription that runs to the right is\n""the Chief administrator of the estate, Ipy"". The text of this statue reveals in more detail what the deceased would like from the altar of Amun:\n""... bread, beer, cattle, poultry, cloth for his clothes, incense and ointments, which the sky gives, that which the earth produces, that which the inundation brings into the light from its source.” On the south side of the pillar, one still recognizes the deceased adoring Osiris face to face. On the east side, we find him holding a sekhem sceptre; while below stands a harpist. On the west face there are remaining traces of a female garment.\nUp above an inscribed bandeaux runs with a formula of offerings for six gods, showing special attention to Osiris.\nThis had to be built of sandstone, because the natural rock had not the required height. The work - which was careless - is original, as shown by the red marks of masons.\nThe face is in variable stages of completion (, east wall and a portion of the south colonnade). In the northern part, the front pillar is already partially smoothed, while in the southern the work is less advanced. cavetto mouldings and astragals are well executed.\nAs we see the court, it is clear that the work was interrupted; the work resumed after the death of the owner, in the period before the funeral.\nThis carries quite well preserved paintings. They begin at the western end of the wall and end next to a rocky outcrop to the east. Note also that this wall has not been smoothed all the way down (: crossing behind the south colonnade, looking to the east).\nPreparatory drawings in red are found everywhere. Inscriptions have not been completely added everywhere not have all been incorporated in the final phase of work. As written by Assmann, as this wall presents itself, it reads like a palimpsest.\nThe wall is surmounted by a frieze shaped floral garland made of blue flowers, limited by another yellow and red frieze. Below runs a wide red band, embedded with rectangles and divided by a horizontal blue green band. There follows a row of yellow circles and open red lotus flowers side by side. This palette of colours is found in the band that borders the scenes in the lower part of the wall.\nIn the middle of the wall significant damage has made us lose a part of the decoration.\nThe deceased, who walks towards the west, stands on the sign of the mountain (too wide) (, ); he wears a long pleated garment and sandals. In front and behind him, four people, placed one above the other, are making a lustration with a nemset vase, according to what is described in Scene 2 of the ritual of opening the mouth.\nBefore Amenemopet are four kneeling priests placed one above the other (). Behind him and slightly downwards, stands a golden pillar Djed-equipped with hands holding a stick and a piece of fabric. A sem-priest is dressed in his characteristic panther skin, and with the hair sidelock of childhood, is standing in the classic attitude of recitation: his left hand holds a paw of the skin, while his right hand is raised, stretched forward and slightly bent. The corresponding text and the recipient are not mentioned (, ).\nAnother sem-priest purifies and burns incense over a well-stocked table of offerings dominated by a mounted bouquet. On the right there is another chapel, the door is open; it is surmounted by a hollowed cornice. It is likely that the deceased and his wife were sitting therein ().\nBelow this main register, we find three smaller registers representing moments of the funeral ritual; we find scenes similar to those of the tomb of .\nOn the far left under the pillar-Djed, there are two adjoining chapels; the water from nemset vases has the form of a string of red drops instead of the usual zigzag appearance (). LThe next two scenes form a whole and show the offerings made to the god of the dead, Anubis, considered the master of embalming, in charge of the transfiguration of the deceased. He is ritually preparing the corpse and helps the lector priest, he takes the role of Horus, son of Osiris, who assumes the role of his father.\nA standing priest extends his hands over the coffin or a chest. Further to the right, another priest who is kneeling offers two vases in front two coffins. The largest of the coffins is shown with legs; it is edged with a double checkerboard pattern and topped with a frieze of khakerus (), a frieze that mimics the reeds or plant stems which featured in the decoration of the walls. Originally, we did not find these friezes in the royal domain, and then in the New Kingdom they are found in individual tombs. The scene ends with the representation of the Goddess of the West, looking to the left. This then closes with the ceremony of the boundary by driving posts into the ground (), followed by the voyage to Sais.\nThis is represented in all the major epochs. The procession to Sais occupies considerable space in the tombs. It is to Sais that the livestock is taken that is sacrificed during the pilgrimage.\nAt the end of mummification, the mummy was placed in a cult papyrus boat where a lion-shaped bed stands on which the coffin reposes. In front and behind it, two priests lean towards it. Next comes a tall coffin (with hollow cornice and khakérus frieze) behind which these is a priest in a recitation position of the recitation. The third coffin is on a sleigh; two priests accompanying it, faces turned toward it while their bodies and feet point forward. They pull on the same rope in opposite directions.\nThe last coffin is again on a papyrus boat and is hauled by three men; at the front and rear we find a man leaning towards it. On the far right, the procession was greeted by a priest who lifts a vase up high ().\nOn the top, there are two boats; the front one has a helm and a crew of three men: perhaps it hauls the second boat. In it are four priests with their typical order behind a coffin (?) covered with white and red braces. At the stern, a kneeling woman is in a position of worship position, while in the bow it is a man who is kneeling.\nOn the bottom, there is a tomb facade with hollow cornice; a priest carrying a haunch of beef goes towards it. To the right another priest advances. Eight men dressed in priest sashes bear on a sled a finely crafted coffin. Below appear three women making a ritual gesture of deference ().\nBesides these three registers appears a set of magazines that were perhaps a part of the temple of Amun and that could well be related to the function of the deceased. Among the various products stored a stele with King Seti I in front of Amun (). is recognisable in the midst of copper bars, bags and elephant tusks. At the top and bottom, there are very fine palm form capitals and column bases, as well as a roof.\nAn empty space of three metres separates these scenes from the following. It continues to the start of a long procession which is divided into two parts, one which goes to the left, and the other to the right ().\nAt the far right (west) wall, the deceased and his wife sit before a sycamore tree (Ficus sycomorus) ()\nsee clearly the red fruits on green foliage. Above the deceased, their associated Ba birds, human-headed with a hawk body. Already in the Pyramid Texts the Ba bird is the ""living soul"". It leaves the body at death, but cohabits with it in its lifetime. The Ba is free to move, but rejoins the body at night. The modern name soul only captures a small part of the significance of this entity. The deceased is holding a container into which the water flows which the divine tree (barely visible on the left) has poured with a hes vase. The sycamore is related in funeral texts to the sunrise. Two turquoise sycamores frame the point of the eastern horizon where every day the sun rises. Hathor is often mentioned as Mistress of the Sycamore. However, the funerary texts more readily associate the sunrise with the sky goddess, Nut; Nut is also mentioned in the text accompanying the Goddess. The deceased and the power of his Ba are powered by Nut, and live under her protection forever. Nut provides protection, shade and food: ""Take thee ... the bread to which you are entitled and fresh water that will delight your heart ..."" said the goddess, and Amenemopet answers: ""May you cause that my Ba lands on your foliage that it shelters in your shade, and drinks your water ( junction between the south and west walls).']"	['<urn:uuid:eeeb541f-d6ec-4838-ab56-6964d7ea760d>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	27	74	2996
77	significance sweden holstein cows mastitis research findings imported semen	A 1994 Swedish study revealed important findings about Holstein genetics. When Swedish dairy producers imported North American Holstein semen, they achieved substantial gains in milk yield without increased mastitis rates. This unexpected outcome, which contradicted the typical antagonistic relationship between milk production and mastitis, was attributed to the superior udder conformation of North American Holsteins. The study demonstrated that improved udder conformation could counteract potential increases in mastitis despite higher milk production.	['Udder health is an animal breeding success story\nUdder health is an animal breeding success story\nby Chad Dechow\nThe author is an associate professor of dairy cattle genetics at Penn State University.\nThe Animal Improvement Programs Laboratory (AIPL) at USDA releases DHI statistics every year. Those trends found at http://aipl.arsusda.gov/publish/dhi.htm allow us to track a variety of traits. There are many impressive trends in this data, but the combination of a steady rise in milk, fat and protein yields coupled with lower somatic cell counts stand out to me.\nThe reason I find this combination impressive is the antagonistic genetic correlation between yield and mastitis. The correlation suggests that we should see a slow but steady rise in the rate of mastitis as milk yields go up over time. We also need larger udders to hold the extra milk, and big udders are likely to be closer to the ground and more easily injured. Today’s cows have the same number of teats as lower-yielding cows in the past. Higher yield means more milk exiting through the same four teats, resulting in more potential wear on teat ends.\nDespite the potential added stress on a cow’s udder, average test-day somatic cell counts have declined from over 300,000 in 1995 to just over 200,000. Meanwhile, milk yield has improved by nearly 8 pounds per day in the same time period.\nCredit type-minded breeders\nWe need udder capacity to hold more milk, but there is more than one way to boost udder volume. Udders can be deeper or they can be longer and wider. Breeders have placed a lot of selection pressure on making sure udders did not become deeper and more loosely attached, even though bulls that transmit the best udder conformation may not have always been at the very top of bull rankings for other traits.\nThe genetic relationship between udder traits and mastitis is well-documented. The single most involved trait is udder depth. Udders held far from the ground and close to a cow’s body wall are less susceptible to mastitis. A strong fore udder attachment also has a favorable relationship with mastitis resistance and is highly correlated with udder depth. The relationships between the other udder traits and mastitis are relatively modest.\nA 1994 study helped to document the success that North American Holstein breeders had in limiting upward movements in mastitis cases in response to higher milk yields. Researchers from Sweden evaluated the change in milk yield and mastitis incidence. Sweden has a national database of mastitis treatments and is able to track how mastitis rates have changed over time. Swedish dairy producers imported North American Holstein semen, and researchers noted that this yielded a substantial gain in milk yield. However, mastitis rates did not climb as milk yield rose, which was attributed to the terrific udders of North American Holsteins. As the authors stated:\n“The “Holsteinization” of the Black and White cows in Sweden has, on average, led to a marked increase in production without a change in the prevalence of mastitis, despite the generally observed antagonistic relationship. A possible deterioration has probably been counteracted by correlated positive effects of simultaneously improved udder conformation,” (Journal of Dairy Science, Volume 77, pages 3252 – 3261).\nI have challenged the direction that we have taken for type traits such as body size and will provide some thoughts on dairy form in the future that not all will agree with. However, it is quite clear that breeders knew what they were doing when it came to udder traits. They deserve credit for placing strong emphasis on udder conformation at a time when many involved with genetics thought that it would shift selection pressure away from more economically important traits.\nIt wasn’t until 2000 that udder composite was included in the Net Merit index. There is some evidence that the relationship between udder traits and herd life is not as strong now as it once was. I think this is largely because of the tremendous progress we’ve made in udder conformation.\nThe Swedish researchers were able to pinpoint improved udders as largely responsible for the favorable mastitis outcome because genetic evaluations for SCS (somatic cell score) were not yet available at that time. The researchers noted that even though we had prevented upward trends in mastitis, improvements in genetic selection programs were certainly possible. Indeed, the genetic trend for SCS rose slightly until the last 5 to 10 years for most breeds. The release of SCS and productive life (PL) evaluations in 1994 have provided additional opportunities to select for udder health. As a result, SCS genetic trends are now declining for most breeds. The exception to this is the Jersey breed, where the genetic trend appears to have leveled off more recently.\nWhile we have developed a fairly robust system to select for mastitis resistance with the combination of udder conformation, SCS and productive life, additional improvements are possible. Some bulls have daughters with high rates of mastitis even though they have good udders and low SCS. Such bulls can only be detected by generating direct mastitis PTA (predicted transmitting ability).\nThe nationalized cow health databases in Sweden and other Nordic countries facilitate estimation of mastitis-resistance PTA. We do not have such a system in the United States. However, our dairy farmers do record a substantial amount of cow health data with various dairy herd management software programs. Researchers have demonstrated that such data can be used to generate disease resistance PTA, so there is potential for us to expand our udder health selection toolkit to include direct mastitis evaluations in the future.\nIt takes a team effort\nThe maintenance of high levels of udder health in our dairy population despite substantial gains in milk yield represents a successful collaboration of different industry segments. Much of the credit for the improvement in udder health certainly goes to changes in management, milking routines and housing strategies. Quality bonuses that provide incentive to improve udder health have been a help. Scientists have developed novel traits like SCS for genetic selection, and type breeders have helped to improve udder conformation. Ultimately, it is our dairy producers who implement the genetic selection and management changes that have helped to protect the well-being of dairy cows as we select for higher yields.']	['<urn:uuid:2ee4163c-d7fc-4dda-b211-3cf5f7aabfb7>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	9	72	1048
78	As an architect working on social housing projects, I need to understand what are the immediate resident needs for safety repairs in affordable housing, and what are the technical requirements for fire containment in multi-story buildings?	Regarding resident needs, Grenfell revealed a pattern where residents' repair requests were often ignored, and when people complained about service, they were made to feel they were the problem. On the technical side, multi-story buildings require specific fire containment measures - most multi-storey, non-residential buildings in England need 60 minutes of fire resistance. Buildings must be sub-divided into discrete compartments separated by fire-resisting walls and floors, with the degree of sub-division depending on the building's use, fire load, height, and presence of sprinkler systems.	"['On 31st October 2019 Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth moved a Motion, “that this House takes note of the Phase 1 report of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry.” The Bishop of Durham, Rt Revd Paul Butler, spoke in the debate, drawing attention to the work of churches and others in supporting the survivors, and the wider issues of neglect within the community.\nThe Lord Bishop of Durham: My Lords, I thank the Whips Office for understanding that my friend the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of St Albans cannot speak due to the change of time, and that I have been allowed to speak in his place.\nIt is important for us to remember that for the bereaved families and survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire, who have now suffered for so long, the past week has been particularly difficult. The report mentions many contributing factors, including issues of fire safety, communication between emergency services, building regulations and the use of materials. In his introduction, the noble Lord, Lord Bourne, spoke eloquently on all those, and many other noble Lords will be able to speak about them from a position of informed authority.\nHowever, faith groups such as the Church of England have played what has often been an unmentioned—although I thank the Minister for his strong mention—but critical one in the lives of Grenfell survivors. That is why I and all those on these Benches feel so passionately about our collective role in this matter. In the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, three of the main spaces used for public meetings were St Clement’s Church, Notting Hill Methodist Church and the al-Manaar Muslim cultural centre. The role of faith communities in bringing people together in the face of adversity was a critical factor in assisting in the immediate recovery from the fire. Local community groups, such as the Harrow Club, the Rugby Portobello Trust and the Clement James Centre, motivated by faith in the local community life, played an important role in the wider and longer-term response. Such local community groups, faith-based and otherwise, will always provide important spaces for social cohesion and the cultivation of habits of community building. Members from all faiths and none will join me in praising the wonderful work of all those groups and all they continue to do in the Grenfell area.\nAmidst the tragedy and horror of that event in 2017, there is an opportunity for policymakers and community stakeholders to consider what is wrong in some of our society’s very fabric and how we can all work together to improve it. The social legacy of Grenfell is something that my colleague the Bishop of Kensington, Bishop Graham Tomlin, has spoken about repeatedly. The perception of neglect is very strong on the ground, yet there is also hope found in local groups and communities, which provide a vision of possibilities for society in and around Grenfell Tower.\nNevertheless, the neglect felt by many before the tragedy has not gone away. Prior to the fire, as Bishop Graham states, there was an overwhelming feeling that the issue of Grenfell was not being heard. There is a common thread of perceived neglect by authority figures. Stories are repeatedly told of residents trying to get the tenant management organisation to attend to repairs. When people complained about the service they received, they were made to feel that they were the problem. This disincentivised them to pursue it.\nThis feeling of being a burden on society cannot be solved overnight. Nor can the perception that the voices of Grenfell are ignored. It is clear that lessons have not been learned by wider British society. Members of this House will be concerned at the sense of outrage that survivors of the tragedy have felt at the media’s publication of and speculation about the report before they had time to read it themselves. Is this not a sign that Grenfell voices are still not respected, taken seriously or appreciated in and of themselves?\nThe experience of Grenfell residents about repairs to their homes raises wider issues of social neglect and the perception of affordable and social housing. Affordable and social housing has slipped down our list of priorities over the years, and with its loss of priority went effective opportunities for tenants to voice complaints or have a say in accommodation standards. Furthermore, as a result of our drastically reduced social housing stock, many have felt that they have become the,\n“dumping ground of the most vulnerable in our society”,\nto cite my colleague Bishop Graham again. As Christians, we believe that each person is created and loved by God and that within all people is an innate value. Moving towards a better regulated social housing framework would do much to work towards that valuing of every person.\nHousing is a health issue as well as a moral one. The WHO’s report on health states clearly:\n“Improved housing conditions can save lives, prevent disease, increase quality of life, reduce poverty, … mitigate climate change”.\nWe need to find a wholly distinct approach to housing, which sees it primarily not as a financial asset but as a home and a key to our well-being. All people deserve to live in a place that is truly a home. Until we can deliver on that ideal, the contributing factors to the Grenfell tragedy cannot be said to have been solved.\nIn conclusion, can the Minister provide clear data on the link between the quality of British social housing and the health of those communities? Can he explain to the House what steps are being taken to address the shortage of social homes and the quality of existing social housing? Above all, will he comment on the perception of neglect felt by far too many of our citizens?\nBaroness Bennett of Manor Castle (GP): …Many powerful points have been made already, but I want to follow the lead of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham in looking at some big systems issues behind what happened in the tragedy of Grenfell…\nLord Kennedy of Southwark (Lab Co-op):…The noble Baroness, Lady Brinton, said that the response in the aftermath of the fire was truly shocking, and it was. It was the community, the churches, mosques, the synagogue and the charities that stepped in when the local authority failed to deliver. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham told the House of the wonderful work they undertook, and I join him in paying tribute to everyone involved… agree with the right reverend Prelate that we have to change our attitude to housing. The loss of council housing and the failure to see housing as homes needs to change. Everyone deserves to live in a home that is clean, safe, warm and dry, and there is nothing wrong with growing up or living in a council property…\nThe Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (Viscount Younger of Leckie) (Con)…The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham referred to social housing. It is important that we improve quality and quantity, with a beneficial knock-on effect on health. We have committed to taking forward the social housing White Paper at pace. It will set out proposals for the standards that we set for social homes. We remain committed to increasing the supply of social housing, committing more than £9 billion as part of our affordable homes programme and delivering more than 250,000 homes by 2022….\n…Rehousing the 201 households that lost their homes has been an absolute priority for the Government. Today, 95% of these households have now moved into their new permanent homes and, as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham alluded to, they must truly be places that they can call home. We will continue to support the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council to ensure that the nine remaining households can move into permanent homes, and that those affected continue to have access to the services and support they need to rebuild their lives. But of course, there is much more to do to restore trust in that community and, as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham said, bringing different faiths together to help with this is of paramount importance…\n…The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham spoke about his concern about the neglect of humanity. Let us never forget that this tragedy is about human beings: human beings who lost their lives, human beings who survived and human beings who keep fighting for the truth and justice they so rightly seek, but now it is also about human beings who are taking—and must continue to take—responsibility and bring about the changes we need to see. No report can change what happened that night or bring back those who lost their lives, but yesterday’s report is an important step on the road to lasting change, and we must work tirelessly and without delay to ensure that we achieve it, so that when we say “Never again” we really mean it.', ""- Project plans\n- Project activities\n- Legislation and standards\n- Industry context\nLast edited 22 Oct 2018\nFire safety design\nBuildings need to be designed to offer an acceptable level of fire safety and minimise the risks from heat and smoke. The primary objective is to reduce to within acceptable limits the potential for death or injury to the occupants of a building and others who may become involved, such as the fire and rescue service, as well as to protect contents and ensure that as much as possible of a building can continue to function after a fire and that it can be repaired. The risk to adjoining properties also needs to be considered, as well as possible environmental pollution.\nThe fire safety of the fabric materials is often expressed in terms of its ignitability or combustibility, with particular regard to the structural elements which must remain in place for stability. The internal finishes may offer a fuel source and need to be carefully specified, and the materials of the building’s contents also provide varying fire risks, such as textiles, furniture, plastics, and so on.\nFire properties are also influenced by the materials behind the surface finish. This was the case in the fire at Kings Cross Station in 1987, with multiple coats of paint leading to the spread and severity of the fire.\n Fire safety strategies\nThe main design options to ensure fire safety are:\n- Prevention: Controlling ignition and fuel sources so that fires do not start.\n- Communications: If ignition occurs, ensuring occupants are informed and any active fire systems are triggered.\n- Escape: Ensuring that occupants of buildings and surrounding areas are able to move to places of safety.\n- Containment: Fire should be contained to the smallest possible area, limiting the amount of property likely to be damaged and the threat to life safety.\n- Extinguishment: Ensuring that fire can be extinguished quickly and with minimum consequential damage.\nThe three components that are required for a fire to start are an ignition source, fuel and a supply of oxygen. Since it is difficult to exclude oxygen from a building, fire prevention tends to concentrate on the other two components.\n Ignition prevention\n- Design out ignition sources.\n- Enable buildings to be managed in such a way that the risk of ignition is eliminated.\nThere are a number of possible causes of ignition.\n Natural phenomena\nLightning damages buildings as an electrical current passes through building materials or along crevices between them, and energy is dissipated with heat reacting with the water content of building materials to produce very hot gases.\nBuildings most at risk are those at high altitudes, on hilltops or hillsides, in isolated positions and tall towers and chimneys. Such structures should be provided with a lightning-conductor system to dissipate the electrical shock directly to the ground.\nFor more information, see Lightning protection system.\n Human carelessness\nHuman carelessness is the most common cause of ignition and the most difficult to design against. Fires may be started by smoking, matches, cookers and other appliances. Deliberate acts of arson are also very difficult to design out.\nIn the short term, services and installations should be correctly designed, specified, constructed, checked and commissioned. In the long term, checking and replacement cycles should be in place so that correct operation can be maintained.\n- Fire load: By controlling the amount of material which will burn and release heat to feed the growth of a fire.\n- Smoke load: It will also reduce the amount of smoke which can be produced.\nOnce a fire is detected (either by occupants or by automatic means), it is necessary to communicate the location of the fire to (other) occupants and to a control and response centre such as the fire and rescue service.\nSee Smoke detector.\nBuildings must be designed so that occupants can escape safely if a fire breaks out. They must be able to reach a place of safety without being overcome by heat or smoke, and so the time taken to escape needs to be shorter that the likely time it will take for fire or smoke to spread.\nThis can be achieved by controlling fire spread and by ensuring that escape routes are easily accessible and neither too long nor too complex. People with mobility problems who may need assistance must also be considered.\nEscape strategies might include:\n- Egress: Simple direct escape from a building when an alarm is sounded.\n- Refuge: The use of the fire containment to provide a place of safety within a building.\n- Rescue: This is a last resort.\nThe ability of a building's design to contain a fire once started is critical to the protection of the property, the lives of the occupants and also surrounding people and buildings. It is the 'tactic' most clearly covered by legislation and also one which insurance companies are most concerned with.\nPassive measures concern the nature of the building structure, subdivision and envelope. They are the properties of a building's construction which serve to limit the spread of fire and smoke in case of a fire.\nSee Fire compartmentation for more information.\n- Resistance to collapse, i.e. the ability to maintain loadbearing capacity (which applies to loadbearing elements only).\n- Resistance to fire penetration, i.e. an ability to maintain the integrity of the element.\n- Resistance to the transfer of excessive heat, i.e. an ability to provide insulation from high temperatures.\n- Oversizing: Deliberately increasing the size of an assembly so that part of it can be destroyed without affecting the structural performance of the rest.\n- Insulation: The provision of a layer of insulating materials around the assembly to protect it from the heat of a fire.\n- Dissipation: Ensuring that heat applied to an assembly is rapidly dissipated to other materials or to the air, so that the temperature of the assembly is not raised to a critical level.\nAccording to the Building Regulations Approved Document B, the structural elements which require fire protection are those which support a roof, which does not normally include single storey buildings. Exceptions to this are where an element of structure provides support or stability to elements, such as:\n- A separating wall.\n- A compartment wall.\n- An external wall which must retain stability to prevent fire spreading to adjacent buildings.\n- A support to a gallery or roof which also forms the function of a floor.\nMost multi-storey, non-residential buildings in England are 2, 3 and 4 storeys in height, and the majority are classed as offices, shops, commercial and assembly. This means that they dominant period of fire resistance is 60 minutes.\nThe spread of fire can be restricted by sub-dividing buildings into a number of discrete compartments. These fire compartments are separated from one another by compartment walls and compartment floors made of a fire-resisting construction which hinders the spread of fire.\n- Prevents the rapid spread of fire which could trap the occupants of a building.\n- Reduces the chance of fires growing and creating a danger to occupants, fire and rescue services, and people in the vicinity of the building.\n- Limits the damage caused to a building and its contents.\nThe degree of sub-division that should be provided by fire compartmentation will be dependent on:\n- The use of the building.\n- The fire load in the building.\n- The height of the building.\n- The availability of a sprinkler system.\nFor more information see Fire compartmentation.\nAttention needs to be focused on the roof and external walls. Once alight a roof can discharge flaming particles carried by convection currents, which pose a hazard if they land on other buildings. It is easier to design a roof that will resist penetration and fire spread than to ensure that a roof will not cause this problem.\nExternal walls need careful consideration as heat radiated through them from a burning building might ignite adjoining buildings if they are too close. The danger of radiant heat can be reduced by restricting the number of openings in the external walls of a building if it is close to other buildings.\nEven when well designed it is inevitable that doors on escape routes will have to be opened and that smoke will therefore flow into the protected area. This danger can be reduced by using lobby access to staircases which provide a form of 'airlock' where only one door will be open at any time.\nAn alternative approach is to pressurise protected areas such as corridors and stairs. Fresh air is supplied to the area to be kept smoke-free and the air pressure is maintained above that of surrounding rooms. If a door into the pressurised area is opened, air will flow out rather smoke flowing in.\nThe simplest way of stopping smoke spreading within a building is allowing smoke to escape to the outside. This will not extinguish the fire but it will tend to contain smoke to its area of origin and gain time for people to escape and for measures to extinguish the fire to be taken.\nAlthough it may be possible to assume that initially smoke will exit directly through roof vents, as the fire grows, layer of smoke will build up beneath the ceiling or roof. This layer will get thicker as the fire grows and the smoke level will gradually descend.\nSmoke venting systems must be designed to ensure that the smoke being added to the smoke layer is exactly balanced by that being expelled through the vents so that the depth of the smoke layer remains constant and does not descends to a level where it endanger the occupants (2.5 m clear height).\nLimitation of the horizontal spread of smoke can be achieved by the installation of smoke curtains which are barriers that come down from the ceiling and create smoke reservoirs. Smoke curtains may be permanently in place or triggered to fall by fire.\nThe most common extinguishing agents are:\nSprinklers are designed to extinguish small fires or contain growing fires until the fire and rescue service arrives. Almost all buildings over 30 m in height must be fitted with a sprinkler system installed in accordance with the appropriate British Standards.\nSprinkler heads are heat sensitive and normally activate at 68°C. Each sprinkler head acts as its own heat detector and only those in the fire area will be activated. The area usually taken as being covered by an individual sprinkler head is 9 sq. m.\nIn certain buildings, it can be difficult for the fire and rescue service to safely reach and work close to fires. Under such circumstances additional facilities are required to ensure that there is no delay and to provide a secure operating base.

79	I'm studying labor movements and would like to know how the AFL and CIO went from being separate organizations to joining forces, and what led to their different approaches in organizing workers?	The AFL and CIO had different approaches to organizing workers - the AFL targeted skilled workers by craft (like plumbers and carpenters), while the CIO represented both skilled and unskilled workers in entire industries (like automobile manufacturing). In the early 1930s, several AFL unions formed the Committee for Industrial Organization and began recruiting members in mass-production facilities, which went against AFL policy. This led to these unions being expelled from the AFL, and the CIO established itself as a separate federation in 1938. Eventually, in 1955, amid increasing anti-unionism, the AFL and CIO merged to form one unified organization.	"['Contemporary World Economic Systems\nThroughout the twentieth century, capitalism and socialism were the principal economic models in industrialized countries. Sociologists often use two criteria criteria property ownership and market control-to distinguish between types of economies. However, keep in mind that no society has a purely capitalist or\nCapitalism is an economic system characterized by private ownership of the means of production, fmm which personal profits can be derived throughmarket competition and without government intervention, Most of us think of ourselves as ""owners\' of private property because we own a car, a television, or other possessions. However, most of us are not capitalists; we spend mOlley on the things we own rather than n1r1ke mOlley from them. Only a relatively few people own income-producing property from which a profit can be realized by producing and distributing goods and services. Everyone else is a consumer. ""Ideal""capitalism has four distinrcive features: (1) privaie ownership of the means of production, (2) pursuit of personal prof t, (3) competition, and (4) lack of government intervention.\nPrivate Ownership of the Means of Production Capitalist economies are based on the right of individuals to own income-producing property, such as land, water, mines, and factories, and the right to ""buy"" people\'s labor.In ifte early stages of industrial capitalism (1850- J 890). virtually all the capital for investment in the United States was individually owned-prior to the Civil War. an estimated two hundred families controlled all major trade and financial organizations. By\nthe 18905. individual capitalists, including Andrew Carnegie. Cornelius Vanderbilt, and John D. Rockefeller, controlled most of the capital in commerce, agriculture, and industry (Feagin. Baker. and Feagin. 2006). As workers grew tired of toiling for the benefit of capitalists instead of for themselves. some of thembanded together to form the first national labor union, the Knights of Labor, in J 869.A labor union is a group of employees who join together to bargain with an employer or a group of employers over wages, benefits, and working conditions. The Knights of Labor\nincluded both skilled and unskilled laborers, but the American Federation of Labor (AFL), founded in 1886, targeted groups of skilled workers such\' as plumbers and carpenters; each of these craft unions maintained autonomy under the ""umbrella"" of the AFL. Under early monopoly capitalism (1890-1940), most ownership rapidly shifted from individuals to huge corporations-large-scale organizations that have legal powers, such as the ability to enter into contracts and buy and sell property, separate from their individual owners, During this period, major industries, including ·.oil, sugar, and grain. came under the control of a few corporations owned by shareholders. As a general rule, individual shareholders- persons who hold or own shares of stock in acorporation-cannot be blamed for the actions of the\ncorporation. Thus, shareholders are able to protect their personal assets while limiting their liability for the corporation\'s actions or debts.\nA1; automobile and steel plants shifted to mass production, workers once again perceived that their needs were not being met. In 193 5 the Congress of Industrial O organizations (CIO) was established to represent both killed and unskilled workers in entire industries such as automobile manufacturing. According to John Sargent,\na steelworker, I got in the mills in 1936,and I [was] fortunate to be caught up in a great movement of the people in this country .... IA] movement of the kind that we had . . . in the 00 was a movement that moved millions of people, literally,and changed not on I)\' the course f the working man in this country, but also the nature\nof the relationship between the working manand the government and between the working man and the boss. (qtd, in Watkins, 1993: 274)\nIn 1937,GMworkers held their first sit-down strike The workers occupied the plants but refused to work, thus paralyzing production (McEachern. 2003). The sit-down strike represented a new approach that came to dominate U.S.labor activism (Watkins, 1993). In advanced monopoly capitalism (1940-present), ownership and control of major industrial and business sectors .\nbusinesssectors have become increasingly concentrated. Economic concentration is the degree to which a. relatively small number of cqptrol adisproportionately large share of a nation\'s economic r sources. Today, many corporations are global in scope. Transnational corporations are large corporationsthat are headquartered in one country but sell and produce goods and services in many countries. These corporations playa major role in the economies and governments of many nations. The magnitude of these corporations is shown in • Table,,13.I. which compares the revenues of the world\'s twenty-five largest t ans national corporations with the gross domestic product of entire countries.Transnational corporations;re not dependent on the labor,\' capital, or technology of anyone countryand may move their operations to countries where wages and taxes arelower and the potential prof ts are higher. Corporate considerations of this kind help explain why many jobs formerly located in the United States have shifted to lower-income nations where few employment opportunities exist and workers can be paid significantly less than their U.S.counterparts, This appears to be a fact of life. workeraare producing parts for automobiles and computers or cooking hamburgers ill a fast- restaurant owned by a transnqtional corporation such as McDonald\'s, which prides itself on placing ""Golden Arches"" throughout the world.', 'Political and Social Movements\nHow old is the AFL-CIO?\nThe roots of the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), today a federation of national unions, date to 1881 when the Federation of Organized Trade and Labor Unions was formed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, by trade union leaders representing some 50,000 members in the United States and Canada. Reorganizing in 1886, the association of unions changed its name to the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and elected Samuel Gompers (1850–1924) president.\nUnlike the open-membership policy of the Knights of Labor (from whom the AFL gained numerous members in 1886), the AFL determined to organize by craft: At the outset, its member unions included a total of 140,000 skilled laborers. Gompers, who immigrated from England in 1863 and became the first registered member of the Cigar-Makers’ International Union in 1864, had been active in labor for more than two decades. Once chosen as president of the AFL, Gompers remained in that office, with the exception of only one year, until his death in 1924. During the nearly 40-year period, he shaped the labor federation and helped it make strides by determining a general policy that allowed member unions autonomy. Unlike the Knights of Labor, which pursued long-term goals such as Knights leader Terence Powderly’s abstract objective of making “every man his own master—every man his own employer,” the AFL focused its efforts on specific, short-term goals such as higher wages, shorter hours, and the right to bargain collectively (when an employer agrees to negotiate with worker/union representatives).\nIn the 1890s the AFL was weakened by labor violence, which evoked public fears. A July 1892 strike at the Carnegie Steel plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania, turned into a riot between angry steelworkers and Pinkerton guards. The militia was called in to monitor the strike, which five months later ended in failure for the AFL-affiliated steel-workers. Nevertheless, under Gompers’s leadership, membership of the AFL grew to more than 1 million by 1901 and to 2.5 million by 1917, when it included 111 national unions and 27,000 local unions. The federation collected dues from its members, creating a fund to aid striking workers. The organization avoided party politics, instead seeking out and supporting advocates regardless of political affiliation. The AFL worked to support the establishment of the U.S. Department of Labor (1913), which administers and enforces statutes promoting the welfare and advancement of the American workforce, and the passage of the Clayton Anti-Trust Act (1914), which strengthened the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890, eventually delivering a blow to monopolies.\nThe CIO was founded in 1938. In the early 1930s several AFL unions banded together as the Committee for Industrial Organization and successfully conducted campaigns to sign up new members in mass-production facilities such as the automobile, steel, and rubber industries. Since these initiatives (which resulted in millions of new members) were against the AFL policy of signing up only skilled laborers by craft (the CIO had reached out to all industrial workers, regardless of skill level or craft), a schism resulted within the AFL. The unions that had participated in the CIO membership drive were expelled from the AFL; the CIO established itself as a federation in 1938, officially changing its name to the Congress of Industrial Organizations.\nIn 1955, amidst a climate of increasing anti-unionism, the AFL and CIO rejoined to form one strong voice. Today the organization has craft and industrial affiliates at the international, national, state, and local levels, with membership totaling in the millions.']"	['<urn:uuid:86620c90-c7b5-4caf-abcd-be9ec99109f5>', '<urn:uuid:3d2baf32-2a1a-41ff-9e00-b3be5194022b>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	32	99	1451

In the central nervous system, antiretroviral therapy helps control severe neurologic disorders, though there are concerns about chronic silent infection and potential indolent brain injury. As for viral reservoirs, semen represents a crucial reservoir where drugs traditionally have difficulty reaching. However, newer integrase inhibitors like dolutegravir have proven effective at reducing viral loads in both blood and semen reservoirs, with the drug achieving sufficient concentration in semen despite only 7-8% of blood levels reaching this compartment.

Drugs have a notoriously difficult time reaching this area of the body, which is thought to be a reservoir of the virus, according to a study published by the Journal of Infectious Diseases.\nThe findings from the study suggest that these new treatments improve the ability to prevent HIV transmission.\nAntiretroviral treatments decrease the viral load in the blood to undetectable levels, with most patients achieving this within 6 to 9 months from treatment initiation. However, 5% to 25% of patients still have detectable levels of HIV in their semen.\n“Therefore, in the case of serodiscordant couples, in which only 1 of the members is carrying the virus, in addition to condoms it is recommended that the seronegative person also takes antiretroviral drugs as prophylaxis while the viral load of their partner decreases in both blood and reservoirs,” said lead scientist Daniel Podzamczer, PhD.\nNewer drugs, including integrase inhibitors such as dolutegravir, work even more rapidly to reduce the viral load.\n“In this study we have focused on evaluating the rate of viral load drop in patients receiving these new treatments, namely dolutegravir,” said first author Dr Arkaitz Imaz. “We have measured the viral load in blood and semen before starting treatment, at 3 days, at 7, at 14, at 1 month, at 3 months, and at 6 months. We know that viral load drop goes quick during the first few days/weeks, then slower and it finally stabilizes. Adapting a complex mathematical-statistical model to our data and to the characteristics of our patients, we have been able to obtain a kinetic model of the specific viral load drop for each compartment, blood and semen, with this treatment regimen.”\nIn the study, scientists discovered the viral load dramatically decreases in the blood during the first few days, and then decreases in the semen during the second phase. They also found that despite this difference, the viral load in the semen becomes undetectable faster, since there is more to eliminate in the blood, according to the study.\n""These results suggest the possibility of reducing the time of previous antiretroviral prophylaxis when using these new treatments,"" the researchers said.\nScientists also found that the fall pattern is more uniform in blood compared with semen, which shows the unpredictable nature of the HIV reservoir in semen. Currently, there is no proven association between the concentration of the drug in the semen and the reduction in viral load, according to the study.\n""The concentration of dolutegravir in semen is more than enough to ensure viral load drop in this reservoir,” Dr Podzamczer said. ""Because even though only 7-8% of the drug in the blood reaches the semen, the proportion of active drug is much higher than what the observed in blood. This was something that we did not know until now.”\nIntegrase inhibitors are currently the first-line HIV treatment due to the significant reductions in viral load. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the effect of other treatments, especially long-term antiretrovirals, on viral loads and their potential to reduce HIV activity, according to the authors.\n“Our study reinforces this decision, especially in light of the current HIV transmission landscape,” Dr Imaz concluded. “If we reduce the time of viral load drop we clearly reduce the possibility of transmission, especially in groups at risk.”']"	['<urn:uuid:5a384db9-2584-4ffa-a9cf-9d8725404d31>', '<urn:uuid:304ba8dd-39ad-44b0-9406-4cae584d263a>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	7	91	1326
81	environmental consultant need details benefits implementation cost savings details sustainable green architecture buildings financial gains health impacts	Green buildings provide multiple benefits across environmental, financial, and health dimensions. They can be delivered at costs comparable to conventional buildings, with investments recoverable through operational cost savings. Environmental benefits include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, efficient resource use, and waste reduction. Financial advantages include energy cost savings through efficient systems and renewable energy usage. Health benefits encompass improved indoor air quality, enhanced occupant well-being, and increased productivity. The buildings also contribute to broader goals like climate change mitigation, energy security, and resource conservation while creating more productive workplaces. These benefits have been documented globally, making green building increasingly the standard practice in construction.	['World Green Building Council showcases cost-effective Green Building benefits throughout the world\nNew report released recently highlights financial value of green buildings to business communities\nA new comprehensive report recently released from the World Green Building Council (WorldGBC), highlights that there are a large number of compelling benefits from green buildings received by different stakeholders throughout the life cycle of a building.\nThe report, “The Business Case for Green Building: A Review of the Costs and Benefits for Developers, Investors and Occupants,” examines whether or not it’s possible to attach a financial value to the cost and benefits of green buildings. Today, green buildings can be delivered at a price comparable to conventional buildings and investments can be recouped through operational cost savings and, with the right design features, create a more productive workplace.\n“This report synthesizes credible evidence from around the world on green buildings into one collective resource, and the evidence presented highlights that sustainable buildings provide tangible benefits and make clear business sense,” said Jane Henley, CEO of WorldGBC. “From risk mitigation across a building portfolio and city-wide economic benefits, to the improved health and well-being of individual building occupants, the business case for green building will continue to evolve as markets mature. Indeed we have already seen this momentum grow globally where in more and more places, green is now becoming the status quo.”\n“This latest global research further reinforces and supports the findings in our own publication, ‘The Rands and Sense of Green Buildings’ which sets out the economic case for green building in a clear, incontestable manner based on local evidence and tangible case studies. It dispels the myth that green building is more expensive, lists the benefits of green building and provides the local proof of these,” explains Green Building Council of South Africa (GBCSA) CEO, Brian Wilkinson.\nKey findings include:\nThe report concludes that by greening our built environment at the neighborhood and city scales, the green building industry can deliver on large-scale economic priorities such as climate change mitigation, energy security, resource conservation and job creation, long-term resilience and quality of life.\n“This report underscores that green buildings play a fundamental and cost-efficient role in tackling some of the immediate challenges of our times,” said Rick Fedrizzi, chair of the WorldGBC and president, CEO and founding chair of the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). “The WorldGBC is proud to continue to play a leadership role in the explosive growth of global green building industry as we all continue to create a world that will give people better, brighter, healthier spaces to live, work and play.”\n“We are optimistic that reviews of this nature will continue to influence the strategies of many astute property investors, owners and developers and that the economic business case will be the key driver in ensuring that green building becomes the accepted standard for all property projects,” concludes Wilkinson.\nThis report was produced in partnership with PRP Environmental along with the following sponsors: Skanska, Grosvenor, and the Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council/Estidama.\nAbout the World Green Building Council\nThe World Green Building Council (WorldGBC) is a network of national Green Building Councils (GBCs) from around the world, making it the largest international organisation influencing the green building marketplace. Green Building Councils are member-based organisations that partner with industry and government in the transformation of their building industries towards sustainability through the adoption of green building practices. On the ground in over 90 countries, GBCs create change in their local markets as a way to globalize environmentally and socially responsible building practices. Visit: www.worldgbc.org\nAbout the Green Building Council of South Africa\nThe GBCSA was the 13th Council to be established and is widely regarded as South Africa’s official independent green building authority. Established in 2007 by leaders from all sectors of the commercial property industry, the GBCSA has a national network of over 1000 corporate members, with over 3400 citizens having completed the accredited course and 539 practicing Accredited Professionals in the field.\nThe GBCSA chairs the African regional network of established and emerging councils.\nIssued by the Green Building Council of South Africa\nGreen Building Council of South Africa\n0861 0 GBCSA | 083 254 8728\ncomments powered by Disqus', 'Sustainability is a word that we encounter and read about on a daily basis. It thus becomes important to know more about the concept. Broadly, sustainability refers to meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. The broader concept refers to natural resources, social equity, and economic development. However, the primary driving force behind the concept of sustainability emanates from two of the most pressing issues of today: judicious use of scarce natural resources and environmentalism.\nExtending the concept to architecture, sustainable architecture seeks to limit the negative impact of buildings on the environment through efficiency and moderate use of materials, energy, development space, and the ecosystem at large. The main focus areas in sustainable architecture rest on a premise of conservation in energy consumption and building material use. The idea is to look at building design that is aimed at limiting the impact of humanity on the environment.\nSustainable architecture is a major consideration in building design as architects try to ensure that buildings generate minimal harmful effects to the ecosystem and the communities.\nSustainable architecture has its reflections in three major areas:\n- Materials. Building materials, construction methodology, and use of resources.\n- Operation. Sustainable operation during the building life cycle, including its ultimate disposal.\n- Energy efficiency. Construction with the goal of achieving long-term energy and resource efficiency as well as function.\nThe benefits in the implementation of sustainable architecture are multipronged, and positive impact can be derived in environmental, economic, and social space. Some of these are:\n- Conservation and restoration of natural resources,\n- Reduction in energy consumption and waste,\n- Reduction in continued dependence on traditional energy sources,\n- Improvement in productivity and performance, and\n- Reduced demands on local utility infrastructure.\nAs architects around the globe increase their focus on the unique challenge sustainability presents in architecture, a conscious shift has been made to buildings being sustainably designed. These buildings strive to reduce their impact on the environment through energy and resource efficiency, reduction in non-renewable resource consumption, and enhancing the natural environment.\nWhat Is A Green Building?\nSustainable architecture has resulted in the emergence of the “green” building. The World Green Building Council defines a Green building that, in its design, construction, or operation, reduces or eliminates negative impacts and can create positive impacts on our climate and natural environment. Green buildings preserve precious natural resources and improve our quality of life.\nThus sustainable architecture, or green architecture, or green design, is an approach to building structures that minimize harmful effects on humans and the environment.\nGreen buildings, thus created, may have several defining characteristics and features like:\n- Efficient use of energy, water, and other resources like use of water-saving plumbing fixtures, energy-efficient lighting, and ventilation systems designed for efficient heating and cooling.\n- Use of alternative or renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.\n- Reduction of waste and pollution and promotion of reuse and recycling.\n- Improved indoor environmental air quality.\n- Use of building materials that are non-toxic, non-synthetic, responsibly harvested, recycled, ethical, and sustainable.\n- Consideration of the environment in design, construction, and operation, e.g., efficient use of space, minimal harm to the natural habitat.\n- Consideration of the quality of life of occupants in design, construction, and operation.\n- A design that enables adaptation to a changing environment.\nWhile most green buildings may not have all these features, green components such as solar energy and rainwater harvesting bring multiple benefits and are effective means to addressing climate change, driving sustainability, and promoting economic growth and vibrant communities.\nSome key advantages in the adoption of green buildings are their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thus safeguarding the environment; reduction in energy use, thereby cost savings on energy spending; reduced and efficient water use and recycling of waste water to minimize the detrimental effects of polluted water; community benefits through a lowered carbon footprint and conserved resources; and human benefits such as well-being, satisfaction, engagement, and productivity.\nBuildings that are healthier, cleaner, and greener do good not only for the planet, but also for the people.\nGreen Buildings and the Sustainable Development Goals\nGreen buildings contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals, and can truly catalyze and address some of the most pressing issues of the world.\n- COST-EFFECTIVE & CLEAN ENERGY (SDG 7). The most cost-effective energy is the through renewable energy sources that are not put to use. However, green buildings leverage renewable energy, which is cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives. Renewable energy produces no carbon emissions, hence, limiting the impact on the planet is an additional benefit.\n- SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES & CITIES (SDG 11). Almost 60 percent of the world’s population will settle down in the urban areas by 2030; hence, ensuring their sustainability is of paramount importance. Buildings are the foundation of urban cities, and green buildings are key to their long-term sustainability. Be it homes, schools, shops, offices, or green spaces, the makeup of communities are the end result of the built environment that must be sustainable to ensure a high quality of life for all. In fact, in many countries, Green Building Councils have developed tools that encourage the formation of green neighborhoods and districts, and have helped cities like Mandaue in Philippines to create and implement policies that promote sustainability across cities.\n- LIFE ON LAND (SDG 15) – The materials used to construct a building play a major role in determining its sustainability. Hence the construction industry and its supply chains have a significant role to play in leveraging responsibly sourced materials such as timber. Green building certification tools also acknowledge the need to reduce the use of water; value the biodiversity, ensuring it is protected; and incorporate this into the area they build on during and after construction, minimizing the damage and design to enhance biodiversity, such as through landscaping with local flora.\nThe way homes and workspaces are designed have an impact on our health, our neighborhoods, and the planet. As a result, the concept of green buildings has started to make an impact in building design and architecture. While in the past some realty players were reluctant to make the switch to green buildings due to higher upfront costs, trends have started to change as people view the broader picture of larger investment returns, such as reduced emissions, lower utility costs, and increased social value.\nGreen buildings are not about fads and trends. They must be designed in a way that ensures their resilience and adaptability, keeping our changing global climate in mind. This is critical in developing countries, most of which are vulnerable to the effects of climate change. But it’s not solely about future proof buildings, the infrastructure must be equally sustainable and resilient to future risks.\nGreen Buildings and the Environment\nThe World Environment Day is celebrated across the globe on 5th June and is the principal platform of the United Nations to create awareness and action to protect the Earth’s fragile environment.\nBuildings are one of the largest consumers of resources such as water, energy, and other materials. Besides, they contribute wastes and pollutants during the three phases of their life cycle: construction, maintenance, and deconstruction. The rampant degradation of the environment across the globe has made it imperative to take measures to optimize the use of natural resources and reduce waste. The shift to green building construction and practices can address these concerns and help make a shift to a sustainable environment.\nBuildings Affect the Climate\nAccording to Architecture 2030, buildings account for almost 40 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). Additionally, if we take into account the other activities, and infrastructure, such as transportation, and other buildings, the number jumps further. With green buildings, the impact our buildings have on climate change can be significantly reduced, while also building resilience into our homes and communities.\nGreen Buildings Generate Fewer Greenhouse Gases\nGreen buildings encompass a structure’s design, planning, construction, operations, and end-of-life recycling and renovation, while considering indoor environmental quality, energy, water, materials selection and location. Green buildings reduce landfill waste, enabling alternative transportation use, and encouraging retention and creation of vegetated land areas and roofs. High-performing green buildings, the LEED-certified buildings in specific, provide the means to reduce the climate impacts of buildings and their occupants.\nLEED rewards all the thoughtful decisions that encourage compact development and connection with transit and amenities, helping the lower GHGs in association with transportation. Additionally, less transport of materials to and from the buildings eliminates the associated fuel consumption. All this combined significantly reduces the carbon footprint of buildings and its occupants beyond what energy efficiency alone does. The inhabitants providing feedback, using systems that showcase a building’s environmental efforts and performance, can drive further reductions.\nWhat better than for the community, architects, policy makers, and users to come together to take a pledge to move toward green buildings and take a step to safeguard the habitat and environment.\nS M Sehgal Foundation (Sehgal Foundation), a rural development NGO in India, has constructed its headquarters building in Gurugram, Haryana, according to the Platinum Standards LEED set by U.S. Green Building Council and the Indian Green Building Council.\nThe founders of S M Sehgal Foundation, Dr. Suri Sehgal and Mrs. Edda Sehgal, conceptualized the “green” design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the building to be in keeping with the organization’s mission to promote sustainable rural development in India and reduce the building’s impact on human health and the environment.\nSehgal Foundation’s building includes green features like photo-voltaic solar panels on the rooftop generating 35 kW of electricity; solar water heaters; shading devices; a rainwater harvesting storage tank of 800,000 liters; onsite recycling of gray and black water; groundwater recharging (zero runoff site); courtyards maximizing natural light and ventilation; recycled wood; various endangered plant species; use of in-situ bricks; maintenance-free exteriors; insulated walls; use of rapidly renewable rubber wood and bamboo; double-glazed glass, and a highly reflective roof finish, among others.\nThe construction of the building is based more on common sense and only a small part uses sophisticated technology. With intelligent designs such as that of the S M Sehgal Foundation building, electricity cost can be brought down by almost 50 percent. The incorrect notion of the high cost of green buildings is a myth. S M Sehgal Foundation in line with their mission “to achieve positive social, economic, and environmental change” have constructed this ecofriendly building, taking a step toward sustainability.\nWatch a video on S M Sehgal Foundation’s green building in Gurugram, Haryana']	['<urn:uuid:967c0940-d2a4-43ea-bec1-be86413f8635>', '<urn:uuid:4709d2ef-e688-4365-84ca-b7c15f89a7cb>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	17	103	2463
82	How can you determine if historical race data is too outdated to be relevant when analyzing trends in Cheltenham Festival handicaps?	You can check if race data is outdated by separating data by year/renewal and looking for consistent upward or downward patterns. For example, in the Grand Annual Handicap Chase, the lowest-rated horse's handicap mark increased from 125 in 2000 to 137 in 2016, showing significant evolution. If there is a statistically significant correlation between time and the factor being analyzed (with p-value less than 0.05), the data shows evolutionary change and should not be used in trends analyses.	['In today’s world we are increasingly aware that data can be powerful in informing decisions; very often, large sets of data from past events are used to help predict the likelihood of things happening in the future, given a certain set of circumstances.\nUnsurprisingly, this concept applies to horse racing and punting, and plenty of people use trends (essentially data from past renewals of given races) to help them make decisions on which horses are likely to win these races in the future.\nI have seen a huge variety of trends metrics used to narrow down potential main players in races, including: mean (average) winning rating; mean weight carried; mean runs per season prior to race; mean SP; proportion of wins over a given number of renewals of different ages, sexes, and with previous course or distance-winning form. Sometimes, trends summaries combine lots of these metrics to produce an ‘ideal template’ for what you should look for in a selection (e.g. a horse rated 140-145, weighted between 10-12 and 11-03, run 3 times this season, SP of 6-1 (7.0) – 10-1 (11.0), aged eight, won at the track before…).\nWhile trends analyses can (sometimes) be informative, there are a number of potential pitfalls. The three main ones are listed below, along with tips for lessening their impact and resources that will help you perform your own, statistically rigorous trends analyses.\nPitfall 1: Using a lack of data\nAny statistician will tell you that the more data you have to work with, the more confidence you can have in an apparent trend actually having an influence on results. But frequently the trends you see or read in racing conversations are woefully scant in terms of data.\nGiven that there are so many variables at work in racing, any trends that consider individual variables (e.g. the winner’s official rating band, age etc.) should incorporate at least 50 data points (and preferably more than that).\nTip 1: Instead of limiting data to ‘winners’ only, incorporate ‘placed’ horses too\nAlthough this may not be appropriate for non-handicap races (due to the smaller fields that are typical), it ought to help you accrue a larger data sample for big handicaps.\nThere is so little margin between winning and coming second, third or fourth in a big handicap with lots of runners (e.g. the Coral Cup at Cheltenham), that it is easy to argue that any horse filling the places could be treated as succeeding for your trends analysis. For example, if ‘weight carried’ really is a significant factor in affecting the likelihood of success, you would expect horses with similar weights to the winner to also perform well in behind him/her. And, if they don’t, the odds are that weight carried isn’t all that important.\nPitfall 2: Ignoring race evolution\nIt is easy enough to gather large data samples for most big races if you go back far enough, but for that data to be valuable it must come from races that are similar in make-up; after all, the whole point of a trends analysis is to see if there is anything common about the typical winners (and losers) that can help you predict likely future winners (and losers). Of course, this can only be possible if these races are similar year to year (in terms of the number of runners, the abilities of the competitors, and the course conditions).\nRacing evolves, though. The make-up of a race in 2016 might be considerably different to the 1996 — or even the 2006 — renewal of that same race. In these instances, including data from older renewals will make any emergent trends irrelevant.\nSuch evolutionary changes are easy to visualise in some of the Cheltenham Festival handicaps, where the official rating required to get into these races has risen considerably in the last 10-15 years. For example, in 2000, the lowest-rated horse in the handicap in the Grand Annual Handicap Chase ran off an official handicap mark of 125; in 2006 it was 126; but in 2016, the lowest-rated ran off 137. That’s a big jump in a short space of time, which is typical of Festival handicaps that are increasing in quality according to the ratings each year; clearly it would be crazy to include all that data in the same pot when calculating the mean handicap mark of the winner. Yet each year, you will see trends analyses suggesting the ideal handicap mark for a potential winner of the Grand Annual that incorporate some of these out-dated data.\nTip 2: Check races for similarity before including data in any analysis\nThis is so simple to do; all you need is separate your data by year/renewal and then see whether there is a consistent upward or downward pattern. You can use the below spreadsheet to see if there is a correlation between time (year/renewal) and the factor you are interested in (e.g. official handicap rating, age etc.).\n< Correlation spreadsheet >\nSimply input the data into the two blue columns and the calculations will take care of themselves. The correlation result will be displayed between -1 and 1, with numbers closer to 0 implying no correlation, and numbers closer to either -1 or 1 implying a stronger correlation. Also note the p-value / significant number. Only if this is less than 0.05 is any correlation deemed to be statistically significant.\nIf there is a significant correlation, then your data are showing evolutionary change because the factor you are interested in is affected by year/renewal. In this instance, these data should not be used in trends analyses.\nNote that you can work backwards from such a result, removing the oldest years/renewals and their data, and then recalculating to see if the significant correlation disappears. If it does, you can use the data from the more recent years/renewals.\nPitfall 3: Not assessing whether a trend is statistically significant\nA trend is useless in helping you narrow down potential winners if there is no statistical confirmation that it is unusual in a mathematical sense. For it to be meaningful it needs to show that something has happened far more or less often than expected in past renewals. And there is more in that phrasing than first meets the eye.\nAs an example, if you look at the past 10 renewals of a race and find that 9 winners were aged three and only one was aged four, you might assume that four-year-olds had performed really badly and that they are therefore likely at a major disadvantage once again. But, to be sure they actually did underperform relative to what you would expect based on chance alone, you need to consider how many three- and four-year-olds ran in these renewals and what kind of chances they had.\nIf around 90% of the total runners were aged three and their SPs were similar to the 10% aged four, you would expect around 9/10 races to have been won by the three-year-old group (assuming of course that the difference in age is important in influencing success).\nThe SPs of these horses are really important. Imagine that there were 10 horses in one of these races and five were aged three, and five were aged four. Clearly, if the three-year-olds took out a huge proportion of the market (say they included the favourite and three of the next four in the betting), the winner would be much more likely to come from that group than from the four-year-old group.\nAssessing statistical significance\nI use the term ‘statistical significance’ fairly lightly here, as the below guide and resources have been greatly simplified from a mathematical point of view; they will, however, provide a fairly accurate means for assessing how significant an apparent trend is, and they will do this without requiring any statistical know-how or complex statistical software packages to compute.\nUse the below spreadsheet to perform your analyses very painlessly. The blue sections indicate regions that you must input data in, whereas the pink sections will generate numbers automatically based on your data. You will see I have included enough columns to take data from 10 renewals, and for up to six groups (A to F). If you want to assess trends for things such as weight carried, or official handicap rating, just group horses into six bands (e.g. official handicap rating 120 – 124, 125 – 129, 130 –134, 135 –139, 140 – 144, 145 – 149).\n< Using trends spreadsheet >\nBelow is a three-step guide that provides some insight into what is going on in the spreadsheet, and why it needs to be going on to provide you a reliable measure of whether a trend is meaningful or not.\nStep 1: Access your past data of interest\nI suggest you pull up the results from the most recent 5 – 10 renewals of the race you are interested in generating trends for. Ideally, you are aiming for a minimum of 50 data points (a minimum of 50 total runners across the renewals you are assessing).\nThe more data the better, but the more recent the renewals the better, as well; if you are able to get 50 or more data points from the seven or eight most recent renewals, that may be preferable than getting lots more data but including the last 20 renewals (see the pitfall of race evolution, above).\nStep 2: In each renewal, group all the runners together that fell into the discrete category you are assessing (e.g. age, or weight band etc.). Then calculate each group’s chance of success in that renewal based on their SPs\nTo calculate the different chances of success for each group, add the individual chances of success for all horses that fall into each group. For example, in our three-year-old versus four-year-old example mentioned above, suppose that in one renewal there were only two horses representing the three-year-old group.\nTo calculate that group’s chance of success, you would add Horse A and Horse B’s chances together (e.g. Horse A: 4-1 or 5.0 = 20%, Horse B: 7-1 or 8.0 = 12.5%, so the three-year-old Group chance of success = 32.5%, or about 2-1 or 3.0).\nBecause you should include places as ‘successes’ in the same way as ‘wins’, you must then multiply each group’s % chance of success by the number of places available in the race. Suppose there were three places available; you should multiply 32.5% by 3 to get 97.5% for the three-year-old group.\nNote that the race totals for all groups will exceed 100% in the win market (sometimes by a long way in handicaps with lots of runners), so you need to approximate their real chance of success as if all groups added to 100%. This is simple enough; you just need to divide 100 by the total win % for all groups and then note that figure down before using it to multiply each individual group’s % chance of success. Suppose the total win % for all groups was 124. We would divide 100 by 124 to get 0.806. We would then multiply 97.5 by 0.806 to get 78.6% as the final % chance of success for the three-year-old group in this renewal.\nStep 3: Add each group’s % chance of success across all the renewals and compare the frequency of expected ‘successes’ with real-life ‘successes’\nIf any group performs much better or much worse than expected across all races, there is a chance that you have found a meaningful trend.\nIn the spreasheet resource I have set the statistical significance at a confidence limit of 95%, which is standard practice in most scientific research studies. This is important – a statistically significant result does not prove that a trend is meaningful; it just provides strong support that it is.']	['<urn:uuid:2d96684b-cb21-4927-a66e-b70f4259c642>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	21	78	1965
83	Which animal has better eyesight, bats or Arctic wolves?	While bats have very poor eyesight and rely on echolocation to navigate, Arctic wolves have well-developed vision with eyes that change from blue at birth to golden-brown in adulthood.	"[""This week we are going to be looking at different habitats and what animals can be found there. A habitat is a natural home or environment of an animal, plant or other organism. A few examples of a habitat might be a coral reef, a flower bed or a jungle. Each habitat has a variety of animals that live there, they need to provide an animal with: food, water, shade, light, air, shelter and a breeding ground.\nHave a think about what habitat a polar bear, a giraffe, or a shark might live in?\nThink about what habitats humans live in? Why do they choose to live there?\nYour task this week is to research 3-5 different habitats of your choice. Write down which animals live there and why that habitat is the perfect place for those animals to live. Below are a list of habitats you could use to get you started but if you can think of your own ideas that's great.\nA field, tree, river, desert, coral reef, forest, rainforest, sea, mountain, grass, arctic, hedge, flower bed, swamp, pond, jungle.\nThis week in science we are going to look at what makes animals unique or different from any other animal. Have a think about the following animals and see if you can think what makes them unique from any other animals, there is more than one reason they are special. (Answers are below).\nAll of these animals are very different from other animals, the platypus is a mixture of many different animals, it closes it eyes and ears underwater and uses its bill to sense food. Bats have very poor eyesight but use echolocation to accurately fly without bumping into anything. Sharks don’t have any bones in their body and have an endless supply of teeth. Whales don’t sleep otherwise they would drown.\nThese are just a small number of interesting facts about these animals, they are all unique and different to any other animals in the world.\nYour task this week is to research about any animal you like, and make a poster about what makes that animal unique and different from any other animal. Make sure to include lots of interesting facts about one or as many animals as you like. You can use the websites below to get you started then think of your own animals.\nThis week in science we are looking at the two main groups that animals can be split into, any animal in the world can be split into two main groups vertebrates (they have a backbone) and invertebrates (they don't have a backbone). Think about some animals that might fit into each group then watch the videos below.\nYour task for this week is to make 2 colourful fact file posters, one about your favourite vertebrate and another one about your favourite invertebrate. Make sure each animal you use is still alive today and you give lots of interesting information such as:\n-How tall/wide/long/heavy the animal is\n-Where the animal lives\n-What the animal eats\n-How long the animal usually lives for\n-Is it dangerous\nMr Hynds would choose his favourite vertebrate as a golden cheeked gibbon after his trip to Monkey World in Dorset, they walk around in a funny way and can swing very fast through the trees. His favourite invertebrate would be a box jellyfish as they are one of the most dangerous animals in the sea, if you haven't heard of them before have a look online!\nThis week we are going to look at classifying or grouping animals based on their characteristics or how they are different from each other. But before we get to that, what makes an animal a living thing? Have a think about what the difference is between living and non living things. Can you list the differences between a living and non living thing? (Think about MRS GREN).\nTo find out watch the following video https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/clips/ztbw2p3\nAnimals are an example of a living thing, however animals can look very different. Have a think about what makes animals similar and what makes them different, which animals are very similar and which are very different? When scientists discover new animals or plants they have to think about what other type of living thing it is similar to. In order to do that they use a sorting tree.\nThis week your task is to make a sorting tree, like the one below, for your choice of animals. Make sure to include a variety of animals from different places or habitats thinking about how they are similar or different. Use the example in the word document below to get you started then have a go at creating your own.\nThe new science topic is all about rocks, we will look at how fossils are created, how rocks and soil are formed, and what different types of rocks there are.\nThis week in science we are moving on to look at soil. Watch the video below to find out what soil is and how it forms the soil we see today.\nAfter watching the video see if you can answer these questions, revisit the video if you are stuck.\nCan soil be different? What makes it different?\nHow is soil made from rocks?\nWhat keeps the soil in place?\nThink about what would happen if the soil was to be damaged? What sort of things could potentially damage soil?\nYour activity this week is to collect a small amount of soil, this could be from your garden or on a walk somewhere.\nPlace the soil in a container. Put double the amount of water as soil in the container and give it a good shake. Leave it to settle and observe the changes over time. You could maybe take a photo or draw what you see every few hours/days. You should start to see a soil profile which you can identify using the key words below.\nTop soil (A horizon)\nSub soil (B horizon)\nThis week in science we will be looking at fossils!

For this activity you will need a few different things, if you have them at home fantastic. If not don't worry, you can make your own version at home however you like, it could even be a drawing/painting of what your fossil might look like!\nYou will need:\n- Toy dinosaur or something similar you might find as a fossil.\n- Modelling clay/plasticine/blu tack/playdoh (anything similar)\n- plaster of paris\nFollow the video with an adult to make your own fossil, if you can send a photo to us we would love to see your creations!\nWatch this video about the different types of rocks. The three main types of rocks are igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeuYx-AbZdo\nYour task is to take a walk around a local area of your choice with an adult (could even be your garden) and see what types of rocks you can find (igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic). See if you can identify which type of rock it is from what you have learnt in the video. Maybe you even have some rocks in your home! If you have a magnifying glass you can take a closer look at the detail of the rocks.\nLook at the rocks you have found, think about how they are similar or different (texture, colour, patterns, size). If you find some rocks in your home think about why they have been used for that purpose. Think about whether those rocks have always looked like that.\nThere is also an activity for you to complete on Purple Mash"", 'The Arctic Wolf is well known as the white wolf that is not afraid of humans. It is an amazing animal with adaptations that enable it to survive in the extreme weather of the Arctic regions. We have gathered a complete set of Arctic Wolf Facts For Kids that will help you in learning All About Arctic Wolves. You are going to learn about its scientific name, classification, appearance, physical description, lifespan, eyes, species, diet, hunting, habitat, range, climate, adaptations, behavior, sense of smell, wolf pack, life cycle, reproduction, baby, endangerment, population, predator, role in the ecosystem and many other interesting and fun facts about Arctic Wolves.\nArctic Wolf Facts For Kids\nWhat Is Arctic Wolf\n- Arctic wolf is a medium-sized subspecies of grey wolf indigenous to the Arctic regions of North America and Greenland.\n- It is also known as the polar wolf or white wolf.\n- Arctic wolf is distinguishable from the northwestern wolf due to its smaller size, whiter fur, larger carnassial teeth, and narrow cranium (braincase).\n- Like their southern relatives, Arctic wolves have an isolated habitat range and are not threatened due to habitat destruction or hunting.\n- The skull size of the Arctic wolf progressively reduced since 1930, which is possibly the result of the wolf-dog hybridization.\nArctic Wolf Scientific Name\n- The scientific name of the Arctic wolf is Canis lupus arctos.\nArctic Wolf Classification\n- The following is the scientific classification or taxonomy of Arctic wolf:\n|Sub-species||Canis lupus arctos|\nArctic Wolf Appearance\n- An Arctic wolf has a medium body size with 3.2 to 5.9 feet head-to-tail length.\n- It has a white coat color that resembles the snow.\n- It has two coats; a waterproof inner coat that keeps its body dry and a thick, furry outer coat that keeps its body warm.\n- It has a narrow skull, a short muzzle, and small ears.\n- An Arctic wolf has strong jaws. It has 42 sharp teeth specially designed for tearing flesh and crushing bones.\n- Arctic wolves have short legs and thickly padded paws, which allows them to walk easily on the snow and frozen grounds.\nArctic Wolf Physical Description – Arctic Wolf Characteristics\nArctic Wolf Size\n- Arctic wolves have body sizes from 3.2 to 5.9 feet (0.9 to 1.8 meters).\n- They have sexual dimorphism and male individuals are usually bigger than females.\nArctic Wolf Weight\n- The bodyweight of Arctic wolves ranges from 31.7 to 79.3 kg (70 to 175 pounds).\nArctic Wolf Height\n- The average standing height of Arctic wolves from head to toe is about 3 feet (0.9 meters).\n- At the shoulder region, their height may vary from 2 to 2.5 feet (0.6 to 0.7 meters).\nArctic Wolf Length\n- The body length (head to tail) of Arctic wolves ranges from 3.2 to 5.9 feet (0.9 to 1.8 meters).\nArctic Wolf Lifespan\n- The lifespan of Arctic wolves in the wild is about 7 to 10 years.\n- In captivity, they live longer for more than 18 years due to the proper availability of food and protection from natural hazards.\nArctic Wolf Eyes\n- Arctic wolves have blue color eyes at birth.\n- When they grow, the color of their eyes changes to yellow-golden or orange.\n- Adult full-grown individuals usually have golden-brown eyes.\nArctic Wolf Species\n- Arctic wolf belongs to the species of grey wolf (Canis lupus).\nWhat Do Arctic Wolves Eat – Arctic Wolf Diet\n- The Arctic wolf is a carnivore in nature and eats the flesh of other animals as its primary diet.\n- They usually hunt musk oxen and Arctic hare. However, they also eat caribou, moose, Arctic fox, lemmings, birds, seals, and beetles.\n- They are opportunistic and also sometimes scavenge on garbage and carrion.\n- Studies show that muskoxen are their primary prey. Because in the presence of abundant muskoxen, Arctic wolves have a higher reproduction rate as compared to the higher availability of Arctic hares.\n- Another study suggests that the consumption of the two species (muskoxen and Arctic hares) depends on the year and season and it is uncertain how much Arctic wolf relies on the two species.\n- Arctic wolves hunt in packs usually to prey on muskoxen or caribou.\n- The packs are also known for killing cubs of the polar bear.\n- During the winter, they will follow migrating caribou for a large distance.\n- In one meal, an Arctic wolf can eat about 9 kg (20 pounds) of meat.\n- Large hunts usually last for a few days. Between the meals, all members of the pack take turns to guard carcass against scavengers.\nWhat Do Arctic Wolves Hunt – Arctic Wolf Prey\n- The most common prey of Arctic wolves are:\n- Arctic hares\n- However, they also hunt other animal species like:\nWhere Do Arctic Wolves Live – Arctic Wolf Habitat\n- Arctic wolves are native to the Arctic region of North America and Greenland.\n- They spent their whole lives in the Arctic tundra biome.\n- A pack of Arctic wolves has a very large territory of about 1,000 square miles (2,500 square kilometers). The size of their territories depends on the availability of food.\n- Arctic wolves use caves or outcrops to take shelter, as it is difficult to dig the frozen snowy ground to create a den.\n- Many of the Arctic wolf populations live close to the sea to feed on seabirds and seals.\nArctic Wolf Habitat Map\nArctic Wolf Range- Arctic Wolf Location\n- The habitat range of the Arctic wolves occurs above the latitudes of 67° North.\n- The location of their habitat is:\n- Northern parts of Alaska in the United States\n- Queen Elizabeth Islands (from Melville Island to Ellesmere Island) in Northern Canada\nArctic Wolf Climate\n- Arctic wolf is one of the few mammals that tolerate extremely harsh conditions.\n- The climate of their habitat region is extremely cold throughout the air.\n- The temperature range in the region is widespread. The month of January is the coldest month of the year, in which the temperature lowers to an average of about -38℃ (-36.4 ℉). The warmest month is July, in which the average highest temperature is about 10℃ (50 ℉).\n- The daylight in their habitat also fluctuates highly with the season. Days in the winter are dark and without sunlight while the sun does not set in the summer days.\n- Most of their habitat region is covered with snow throughout the year.\n- The average precipitation is 250mm per year.\nWhat Other Animals Live With The Arctic Wolf\n- The following are some of the other animals that share the Arctic wolf’s habitat:\n- Arctic hares\n- Arctic fox\n- Many species of birds (such as Arctic tern, snow goose, and ptarmigan)\n- Lemmings and various other types of rodents\nArctic Wolf Adaptations\nThe following are the major structural and physiological adaptations of Arctic Wolves, which helps them to survive in the harsh Arctic climate:\nShort Muzzle and Ears\n- Arctic wolves have short muzzles and small ears as compared to other subspecies of grey wolves.\n- This feature reduces the surface area to volume ratio and prevents excessive heat loss through the mouth and ears.\nCoat Color and Thick Fur\n- Arctic wolves have white or light grey coat colors, which provides them with excellent camouflage.\n- They also have a double layer of fur; an inner layer of fine and soft hair and an outer layer of thick long hair.\n- The inner layer keeps their body insulated while the outer layer is waterproof and keeps them dry and warm.\n- Their fur grows denser during the cold season to provide extra insulation.\n- The paw structure of Arctic wolves is also well-adapted to their habitat.\n- Their paws have a covering of fur, which acts like snow shows.\n- The fur on their paws provides insulation as well as a strong grip when they walk on the snow and frozen slippery surfaces.\nCountercurrent Heat Exchange System\n- Arctic wolves have a special blood circulation mechanism in their paws that reduces heat loss, as their paws have direct contact with the cold snowy surface.\n- In this mechanism, the blood coming to the paws is used to heat the blood that is leaving.\n- In such a way, excessive heat loss is prevented while the paws are also saved from extreme coldness.\n- Such a mechanism is also found in the feet of penguins and the legs of Arctic foxes.\nThick Layer of Body Fat\n- Arctic wolves have a thick layer of body fat beneath their skin.\n- It provides insulation and also serves as a food reservoir in case of food scarcity.\nArctic Wolf Sense Of Smell\n- Wolves have about 100 times a greater sense of smell than humans. The smell receptive region in a wolf’s nose is about 14 times greater than a human nose.\n- Like other wolves, Arctic wolves also have a keen sense of smell.\n- Their scent recognition level is extremely higher, which they use for hunting potential prey.\nArctic Wolf Behavior\n- Arctic wolves are social and live in groups known as packs. The number of individuals in a pack varies from five to eight.\n- Arctic wolves have very large territories. A pack may have a territory of about 2,500 square kilometers (1,000 square miles) or more. Their territory’s size depends on the availability of food.\n- They communicate through signs, smell, behaviors, and sounds. They howl to communicate with other packs. A pack of Arctic wolves can compare its size with other packs by hearing the howling of other packs. Small packs move to another region to find food upon hearing the howls of bigger packs. In such a way, they avoid fighting with other packs.\n- Arctic wolves are unafraid of humans. In some regions, they can be persuaded to approach humans cautiously and curiously. This behavior is believed to be due to their very rare encounter with humans.\n- Arctic wolves migrate during the wintertime to avoid the complete darkness of their habitat. The 24 hours darkness of their habitat makes it hard to study their movement. So very little is known about their migration.\nArctic Wolf Pack\n- The group of Arctic wolves is known as a pack.\n- A pack has 5 to 8 individuals.\n- Every pack has a dominant male and female known as alpha male and female. They are the leaders of the pack.\n- Sometimes, a pack’s size reaches up to 20 individuals, however, it is uncommon.\n- Most of the packs are extended families and composed of a breeding pair and their pups.\n- A pack cooperatively hunts large animals.\n- All the pack members take care of the pups and protect them from predators and other threats.\n- Individuals of a pack use scent and urine to mark its territory’s borders.\nArctic Wolf Life Cycle\n- The life cycle of Arctic wolves starts when they attain sexual maturity at the age of 2 to 3 years.\n- A mature Arctic wolf leaves its birth pack and establishes its territory along with its mate or either stays within its birth pack.\n- If the size of its birth pack is large, it would have the opportunity of breeding. As in small packs, only the alpha members can reproduce.\n- Upon mating, a litter of 2 to 3 pups is born after a gestation period of 63 days.\n- The lifespan of Arctic wolves is 7 to 10 years in the wild and more than 18 years in captivity.\nArctic Wolf Reproduction\n- Alpha male and female breeds only in the pack of Arctic wolves. However, other mates also breed in large-sized packs.\n- They are known to remain with only one mate.\n- The breeding season of Arctic wolves is from January to March, in which the pairs mate.\n- After a gestation period of about 63 days, the females give birth to a litter of 2 to 3 pups.\n- Arctic wolves use outcrops, caves, or even shallow depressions as a den where the females give birth, as digging the frozen floor is so difficult for them. However, if the frozen snow is not too hard, they will dig a den.\n- The birth of pups occurs in late May to early June.\n- The pups stay with their mother for about 2 years.\nFemale Arctic Wolf\n- As Arctic wolves have sexual dimorphism, the females have a smaller size than males.\n- Female Arctic wolves reproduce, feed the pups with their milk, and take care of them until they become completely mature.\nArctic Wolf Babies – Baby Arctic Wolf – Arctic Wolf Pups\n- The babies of Arctic wolves are known as pups or whelps.\n- They are born after a gestation period of about 63 days.\n- At birth, the pup weighs about 2 to 3 pounds and has dark fur.\n- They are blind and deaf at birth and become able to see and hear after 12 to 14 days.\n- The pups have blue color eyes that become orange or yellow-golden when they are between 2 to 4 months old.\n- As an Arctic wolf is a mammal, the mother feeds the newborns with her milk.\n- After a few weeks, mothers bring small pieces of chewed food to the pups and they start nibbling it.\n- The pups stay in their birth den or cave for about 1.5 months along with their mother.\n- After 1.5 months, they start to join the pack in their activities and learn skills to survive.\n- The pups become full-grown at the age of about 8 months.\n- They stay with their mother for about 2 years.\n- Pups attain sexual maturity at the age of 2 to 3 years.\n- The pups stay generally with the same pack for many years.\nAre Arctic Wolves Endangered – Why Are Arctic Wolves Endangered\n- No, Arctic wolves are not endangered.\n- Due to their isolated habitat, they are not even threatened by hunting or habitat loss.\n- Climate change is the greatest threat to their survival. Extreme variations in the weather cause food scarcity for muskoxen and Arctic hares. It causes a decline in the populations of these species and so, in turn, leads to the reduction of the traditional food supply of the Arctic wolves.\nArctic Wolf Conservation Status\n- The conservation status of the Arctic wolf on the IUCN Red List as Least Concern.\nArctic Wolf Population\n- According to the Cool Antarctica Resources, the total population of Arctic wolves is estimated at 200,000 individuals.\nArctic Wolf Role In The Ecosystem\n- Like other wolves, Arctic wolves also play a vital role to maintain the health, structure, and balance of the ecosystem.\n- They keep the population of prey species in control.\n- Their presence affects the behavior and population of their prey and changes their foraging patterns.\n- In turn, it affects the plants and animal communities and often causes changes in the landscape.\n- That is why wolves are described as the keystone species.\nArctic Wolf Predators\n- Arctic wolf is itself the apex predator of its habitat.\n- The polar bear is the only natural predator of the Arctic wolf.\nArctic Wolf Interesting Facts – Fun Facts About Arctic Wolves\n- Arctic wolf is one of the rare examples of animal species that are relatively not threatened by humans. Due to the isolated habitat range, Arctic wolves are not disturbed by urbanization or habitat destruction.\n- An Arctic wolf has a special countercurrent heat exchange system in its feet, which prevents its feet from freezing while walking on the snow.\n- Arctic wolves are born with blue eyes that become brown or golden-brown when they are growing old.\n- Arctic wolves are fast and can run at the speed of 40 miles per hour when chasing prey.\n- Youngsters of the Arctic wolves eat partially digested food that their mother and other members of the pack regurgitate after hunting.\n- In a pack, only the highest-ranking members are allowed to reproduce. They are known as the Alpha male and females.\n- Like other wolves, packs of the Arctic wolves communicate through howling. They can compare the size of their pack with other packs’ sizes by hearing howlings.\n- Arctic wolves usually avoid conflicts with other packs and small packs simply move to other regions to find food.']"	['<urn:uuid:f50a80b3-2cb1-44a4-a3e7-7e8d930d849f>', '<urn:uuid:7896e363-13ff-4314-aa6a-80a2f053c887>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	9	29	4062
84	I'm fascinated by the interplay between natural light and architectural design. Could you compare how light interaction is incorporated in the D3 House in Israel and Beijing's National Center for the Performing Arts?	Both structures utilize light in sophisticated ways. In the D3 House, the perforated white aluminum facade creates a dynamic interplay of light and shadow that seems to dance across the walls, with semi-triangular patterns allowing natural light to filter through in seemingly random spacing. The building also features huge fenestrations that allow garden views to penetrate the interior spaces. In contrast, the National Center for the Performing Arts features an innovative combination of titanium plates and ultra-white glass in its oval shell exterior, which creates a vibrant graphic effect. Inside, the Opera House's arc-shaped metal-net wall is specifically designed to allow lights and shadows to change according to the performance's progression.	['D3 House is a private family home located in an urban environment in Hertsliya, Israel. The façade of the house by Pitsou Kedem Architects is in fact a kind of a sealed box composed of two large volumes. One horizontal façade is made up of a white aluminium skin with a repetitive graphic pattern in which, here and there, in a seemingly random way, cut-out openings allow a glimpse into the house during the day and the filtering out of artificial light at night. The upper volume is constructed of exposed architectural concrete to create a tension against the lower volume. Designed to create a sense of flight, the upper volume is positioned on a diagonal and emphasises the contrast between it and the perforated white aluminium façade. The envelope facing the street forms a minimalistic and polished object that accentuates the monastic and condensed language chosen by the architects. The street-facing façade stands out because of its restraint, successfully fulfilling its purpose of creating a precise and sleek appearance.\nThe perforation in the white aluminium envelope allows light and shadow to play through, creating in an otherwise calm space a lyrical and harmonious poetry that seemingly dances across the walls of the building and breathes life into the silent walls. The pattern of semi-triangles, and their seemingly random spacing, appear to epitomise the rhythm of the movement of light. The architects made further use of this pattern, seen sometimes at two-dimensional angles almost like a graphic logo, on the unique stone wall in the entrance which serves as a divider between the entrance hall and the kitchen. This massive wall, in its entirety, is crafted in an artistic mix of iron and natural stone and carries the design theme through from the exterior into the house.\nThe other facades are built of huge fenestrations that allow the whole garden to penetrate into the house’s spaces. The transparency of the ground floor strengthens the tension between it and the sloped mass of concrete on the second floor. A large patio at the center of the house forms an interesting meeting point between the internal spaces and the exterior, providing an interlude between being inside the house and the courtyard.\nThe formal polishing, the precision in the detail and in the meeting of materials, the meticulously yet cautiously phrased monastic language all give the viewer, for a moment, a sense that they are looking at a flat and nearly two-dimensional picturesque stage. The diverse and continuing planes of the white tones and the combination of the geometrical performance of the light against the horizontal and vertical surfaces, give the tranquil picture a sense of space and depth.\nAgainst this background, a richer and more varied language was employed in selecting the furnishings. This is particularly evident in a central piece in the dining space for which a decorative bookcase of brass and onyx stone was envisaged by the firm’s object brand, according to architect Irene Goldberg’s design. The surrounding garden also makes use of a wider palette of color to create interest and a contrast between architecture and nature.\nDesign and info © Pitsou Kedem Architects\nImages © Amit Geron', 'Constructed in 2007, National Center for the Performing Arts is the complex of a grand opera house, concert hall, and theater located in the heart of Beijing.\nLocated in Chang’an Avenue of Xicheng District, National Center for the Performing Arts (AKA the National Grand Theater or NCPA) is an amazing art center in Beijing, China. Its unique and attention-grabbing architectural layout was designed by a French architect named Paul Andrew. NCPA’s main building is composed of 3 performing venues namely the Opera House, the Concert Hall, and the Theater.\nThis big dome has underwater corridors, an artificial lake, an underground garage, and a green space. Its area is covering 29 hectares (around 12 hectares). The construction started in December 2001 and was completed in September 2007. Nowadays, the building is thought to be the deepest architecture in Beijing because of its deepest point of -106.6 feet or -32.5 meters. That is equivalent to the height of a 10-floor structure. The National Center for the Performing Arts offers a very sharp contrast to its environment, having an oval exterior surely makes it eye-catching.\nThere are a lot of performances regularly staged in the National Center for the Performing Arts like dance shows, ballets, dramas, symphonies, operas, etc. If you would like to visit and watch a show or two, the National Center for the Performing Arts offers a visiting tour that includes thematic activities, art exhibitions, and facilities.\nNCPA’s Exterior – A Huge Oval Shell\nThe National Center for the Performing Arts’ exterior is a steel-structured oval shell made of ingenious material integration of more than 18,000 titanium plates and more than 1,000 sheets of ultra-white glass. It indeed creates a vibrant graphic effect as if the curtain is drawn apart slowly right before your eyes. It is considered the largest dome in the whole world with its 6,457 tons of weight and 696 feet or 212 meters of an axis. The center is bounded by a crystal-like artificial lake that does not turn into ice in winter.\nAll of the building’s entrances and passages are built underwater, which can give you a special feeling when you walk into it while your head is above water. There is also a greenbelt around the lake where people can wander and appreciate the serene surroundings for free or without a fee.\nNational Center for the Performing Arts Performance Venues\nThe performance venues of the National Center for the Performing Arts including the Opera House, the Concert Hall, and the Theater have separated areas linked by air corridors.\nProbably the most magnificent building inside NCPA is the Opera House with a main hue of gold. This is where operas, ballets, dance-dramas, and large-scale shows are being performed. It has a total of 2,091 seats but there is also a standing room available. The auditorium’s arc-shaped metal-net wall permits lights and shadows to change according to the progress of the performance.\nThe audiences can effortlessly immerse themselves in the inventive atmosphere of the theater. The seamless ballet stage’s surface is the largest one in China made of Oregon timber. The stage also has a three-layer structure that gives good resilience and protection to the performers’ feet.\nSituated on the east side of the Opera House, the Concert Hall is a house of Chinese traditional music and large-scale symphonies. It has an elegant and tranquil look because of its silver-white color. The audience can enjoy the performances from any angle since the auditorium is around the stage. The halls’ ceiling rolls resemble waves that are auspicious to the sound’s diffusion. It can seat a total of 1.859 individuals.\nThe Concert Hall’s pipe organ is one thing that the audience should not miss. It is placed in the hall with 94 stops and a remarkable array of 6,500 pipes. It is actually the largest one in Asia and is truly the Concert Hall’s most valuable treasure.\nThe theater’s design has a distinctive Chinese traditional style. It is where you can be the audience of the stage plays, operas, and national songs & dances. Excluding the orchestra, the theater has a total of 957 seats. Its walls are flameproof because of the Zhejiang’s silk placed on it. The theater’s stage does not only provide a great venue for the Chinese traditional operas but also gives a feeling of closeness between the performers and the audience.\nThe conditioner’s air inlets are built under the seats so the audience won’t feel the wind but enjoy the coolness while seeing the performances. It also has equipment installed for noise elimination so that when anyone leaves while the performance is going on, no noise will be heard.\n|How to get to|\n|By Metro||Take Subway line 1 and leave at Tiananmen Xi Station. Get out from Exit C and find the underground passage directly to the theater. You can also take Subway line 2 and alight at Hepingmen Station. You need to leave the station from Exit B1.|\n|By Bus||Bus 52 helps you to reach Shibei Hutong Station. Buses 1, 5, 52, 99, and Sightseeing Bus 1 or 2 help you to reach Tiananmen Xi Station are.|\n|Standard Ticket||30 Yuan for adults and 15 Yuan for children under 3.9 feet|\n|Combo ticket A||40 Yuan for 1 adult and 1 minor who is under 18 years old|\n|Combo ticket B||65 Yuan for 2 adults and 1 minor who is under 18 years old|\n|Working Hours||From 9 am to 5 pm.|\n|Closed Days||All Mondays with the exception of holidays|\nNote: Minors taller than 3.9 feet must provide a valid ID card.\nThere is a ticket office near the north fate which operates from 9:30 am to 6 pm for days without performances and from 9:30 am to 7:30 pm for days with performances.

85	I'm curious about ancient Iran's wildlife. What animals lived in its mountains and forests, and what hunting and funeral rituals were associated with them?	Ancient Iran had diverse wildlife across its regions. In the mountains, wild sheep (argali) inhabited the slopes while wild goats (ibex) lived on the summits. The highlands were home to eagles, vultures, falcons, ravens, crows, and nightingales. The western slopes had wild swine attracted by acorns, which in turn drew lions from the Tigris reed-beds. The Mazandaran region hosted deer, buffalo, tigers, swan, waterfowl, woodcock, and pheasants. Other wildlife included leopards, wildcats, wolves, bears, hyenas, foxes, snakes, scorpions, vipers, lizards, partridges, and larks. As for funeral rituals, animals played a role in religious ceremonies - for instance, in Zoroastrian traditions, dogs were venerated and were present at funerals. According to the Avesta texts, two dogs would await spirits at the Chinvat Bridge during judgment, similar to how in Indian Veda two dogs served as messengers of Yama.	['IRAN, the chief scene of Firdausi’s Shahnama, is bounded on the north by the Steppes, the Caspian Sea, and the Kur and Rion rivers, on the south by the Indian Ocean, on the east by the valley of the Indus, and on the west by that of the Tigris and Euphrates, and by the Persian Gulf. At present it includes Persia, Afghanistan, Baluchistan, and small portions of Russia and Turkey.\nIt is a lofty and for the most part a rainless tableland traversed by numerous mountain-ranges divided from each other by flat plains and falling away toward the centre, which is a desert white with salt scurf or dun with powdery dust. The mountains are highest round the edges of the tableland and intercept most of the rainfall. Some moisture, however, finds its way even into the rainless region, where it gathers during winter on the higher hills in the form of snow. This snow-water is carefully husbanded, and distributed by means of underground water-courses. The interior is, however, drying up, and city, village, and cultivated field are being gradually overwhelmed in dust and shifting sands.\nPossibly as late as early historical times very different conditions prevailed. The lower plains and depressions once formed a series of lakes that suggested the appearance of an inland sea, and such names as island, port, lighthouse, and etc., are said to still survive in places as a relic and indication of the old state of things, while a considerable body of water is still to be found in the eastern half of the central depression on the frontier between Persia and Afghanistan. This region is now known as Si’stan, but in ancient times was called Drangiana or the lake-country, a name which survived much later in its former capital Zarang, and as “Zirih” is still used in connection with its lake.\nFrom April till late in the autumn the sky, save for an occasional thunderstorm among the mountains, is an unclouded azure, in winter a good deal of snow falls, and in spring the thunderstorms are heavy and frequent. The air is, as a rule, remarkably healthy, but on the borders of the deserts the inhabitants have sometimes to live shut up for weeks together to avoid the pestilential blasts.\nThe favoured regions are those that front west and north respectively. They are splendidly wooded and extremely fertile, all the ordinary flowers and fruits of Europe do well, while in the district between the Alburz Mountains and the Caspian, and known as Mazandaran, the climate is semitropical and the vegetation most luxuriant. Here rice, the sugar-cane, the vine, the orange, and the olive flourish. In the few watered valleys of the long southern coast the climate is tropical in character. The tamarisk and mimosa are largely represented, and here and there are groves of date-palms.\nThe immediate neighbourhood of the salt-deserts is the haunt of the wild ass or onager and of the antelope, the slope of the mountain-ranges of the wild sheep or argali, and their summit of the wild goat or ibex. The tracts artificially reclaimed and watered are the favourite home of the sandgrouse, and the highlands of the eagle, the vulture, the falcon, the raven, the crow, and the nightingale — the bulbul of the poets. The acorns of the western slopes attract the wild swine, which in turn tempt the lion from the reed-beds of the Tigris and the cover of its tributaries. Swine, too, abound in Mazandaran and afford food for the tiger which flourishes there, the dense undergrowth and vegetation of that region affording it as good shelter as an Indian jungle. Here, too, are found deer, buffalo, swan, waterfowl, woodcock, and pheasant. Speaking of the country more generally we may add to this list leopards, wildcats, wolves, bears, hyaenas, foxes, snakes, scorpions, vipers, lizards, the partridge, and the lark. The chief domestic animals are the ox, the sheep, especially the fat-tailed variety, the horse, the camel, and the mule.\nIran is a land of sharp contrasts, of intense heat and cold, of sudden and abnormal changes of temperature, of dead level and steep ascent, of splendid fertility hard by lifeless desolation, of irrigation and dust. Its natural characteristics find expression in the ancient cosmogony of its people. We are told that — Urmuzd the Good Principle — created earth as a lovely plain bathed in a mild perpetual radiance, fanned by soft temperate airs, bounteously provided with fresh sweet waters, and clad in a smooth and harmless vegetation. Here the First Man and the First Ox dwelt in peace and happiness. Ahriman — the Evil Principle broke into this fair scene and all was changed. Gloom minged with light, the seasons’ difference began, the seas turned salt, the streams dwindled, the vegetation grew rough and thorny, drought came and dust and desert; mountain-ranges sprang up from the plain, and the man and ox were stricken with disease and died; but from the body of the former sprang the first human pair from whom all the earth was overspread, and from the body of the latter all other harmless, useful, and beautiful animals, while Ahriman in opposition to these created all noisome and hideous insects, reptiles, and creatures sharp of fang or claw.\nLet us now turn from the land to the people. For us there is no occasion to discuss questions of race from any very modern standpoint. For us it is rather what ethnical views obtained in ancient Iran and moulded its traditions. As to these there is happily little room for doubt, Darius Hystaspis, the founder of the Persian empire and the greatest of its historic Shahs, having decided the matter for us. On the rock of Bihistun he recorded his great achievements in a trilingual inscription, the languages employed being ancient Persian, Babylonian, and Scythian. The obvious explanation of his proceeding is, that he recognised in the population of his vast empire three distinct races of mankind, and, regarding language as distinctive of race, used it to emphasise that great political fact. In thus distinguishing he followed a true philological instinct, and his distinctions still largely obtain at the present day. Each of his three languages represents a great division of human speech. His view, as we shall see, agrees with the traditions and legends of his race, and if some modern Shah were to restore the empire of Darius, and wished to imitate the example of his great predecessor, he would still have to choose languages typical of the same three divisions. In what follows, therefore, language is made the basis of classification, and the divisions thus classified are commonly called the Indo-European, the Semitic, and the Turanian respectively. It is with peoples of the first division that we are chiefly concerned, and only so far as these came into contact with peoples of the other two divisions are we concerned about the latter.\nAt the dawn of history we find peoples speaking languages which, theoretically at all events, may be traced back to one primitive tongue, holding similar religious notions and organised politically as independent self-governing tribes, in possession of large geographical areas both in Europe and Asia. They thus fall into two great divisions — an European and an Asiatic — and are generally known as the Indo-European race. The Asiatic branch seems to have occupied in early times the neighbourhoods of Balkh, Harat, Marv, and possibly. of Samarkand. It described itself as Aryan or noble, as opposed to all those with whom it came into contact, much as the Greeks divided mankind into Hellenes and Barbaroi. It was organised into three orders or castes — priests, warriors, and husbandmen. Its religion was a frank worship of personified natural forces. Its priests were fire-priests, and fire was an especial object of adoration along with the other beneficent powers of nature — Mitra or Mithra, Yama or Yima, Trita, Traitana, and others. Opposed to these were the malignant spirits of drought and darkness, as, for instance, Azi or Azhi, also known as Dahaka — the biter, the serpent-fiend. Water was ever growing scarcer, and drought or plenty turned in the imagination of a primitive people on the struggle of the good and evil spirits for its possession. The former appeared in the lightning-flash, while the gloomy con-volutions of the thunder-cloud suggested the idea that fiends in serpent-form were striving to carry off the precious fluid — the heavenly waters as distinguished from the earthly waters — and hinder it from descending to the help of man. The cloud — the rain-bringer — was perversely regarded as the rain-stealer. The good spirits hastened to the rescue, the lightning-flash clove the cloud, and the demons dropped their booty. The serpent-fiend had to be combated for other reasons too, for his bite brought fever, disease, and death. Accordingly the divine physician appeared side by side with the divine hero, Trita with Traitana, and became, as we shall see later on, merged into a single personality in Iranian legend. Sacrifices were offered, and the drink-offering of the juice of the Soma or Homa plant was poured forth. The plant is usually identified as being the Asclepias acida or Sarcostemma viminale. The Aryans also worshipped the spirits of their ancestors, and were believers in what is called sympathetic magic. They thought that injury done to anything in the remotest way connected with their own persons would affect themselves injuriously. Even the knowledge of their name might be turned to their hurt, and we shall find instances in the poem of children being brought up unnamed to avoid that contingency.\nAt a period which cannot be put at less than four thousand years ago the Aryans themselves divided, and while a portion descended to the Indus and became the dominant race in India, the rest remained and gradually took possession of all that was habitable in the vast region that consequently became known as the land of the Aryans or Iran. The Aryans thus became separated into two branches — an Eastern and a Western. With the former we are but little concerned; the legendary story of the latter is the theme of the Shahnama.\nOf these Western Aryans the two most famous peoples have ever been the Medes and Persians.\nThe Medes, whose modern representatives, if any, seem to be the Kurds, appear in ancient times to have been a loose confederation of kindred tribes broken up into numerous settlements, each under its local head-man or chief. They seem to have had no supreme political head or king to unite the race under one central authority. Their common bond, if any, was a religious one under their priests, the Magi. According to their own traditions the original seat of the race was Iran-vej, i.e., “Iranian seed,” and this has been well identified with the district of Karabagh, the ancient Arran, the ‘Apiavia of the Greeks, between the Kur and the Aras, where the Anti-Caucasus forms the true north-western scarp of the tableland of Iran. In historical times, however, we first find the Medes in possession of the province of Azarbijan, or, to give it its ancient title, Atropatene. The Persians occupied from time immemorial the country on the eastern shores of the Persian Gulf, now represented by the modern provinces of Farsistan and Laristan, and were ruled by kings of the house of Achaemenes. These two peoples, closely connected as they were by language and race, became in the days of Darius Hystaspis dominant in Iran, and to this domination the Medes appear to have contributed the religious, the Persians the political, element. Between the Medes and the Persians lay in ancient times, as we learn from Assyrian and Babylonian records, other kindred — peoples the kingdom of Elam, with its capital at Susa, some twenty-five miles west of the modern Shuster, and the kingdom of Ellipi, in the neighbourhood of the modern Hamadan. The Iranians as a whole were bounded on the west by Semitic and on the north by Turanian peoples. On the east they were conterminous with the Aryans of India, and ultimately they came into contact with the Western Indo-Europeans as well, notably with the Greeks and Romans. As the cosmogony and religion of the Iranians were largely derived from their physical, so was their tradition from their ethnical, environment. We are concerned with all three, but especially with the last — their tradition. The remainder of the present chapter will therefore be devoted to a brief, and necessarily dry, summary of their historical relations with the Semites as represented by the Assyrians in early and the Arabs in later times, with other Indo-European races represented by the Greeks and Romans in the west and by the Hindus in the east, and with the Turanians as represented by the Kimmerians, Scythians, Parthians, Huns and Turks.\nThe Irdnians and the Semites. — In the numerous contemporary records of the Assyrians we find many references to the Iranians. The whole of the western frontier of f ran, from the Medes in the north to the Persians in the south, seems to have been subjected at one point or another to almost constant aggression, at first by mere raids but later on by attempts at permanent conquest, at the hands of the great warrior-monarchs of Nineveh — Shalmaneser II. (B.C. 858-823), Samas Rimmon II. (B.C. 823-810), Rimmon-nirari III. (B.C. 810-783), Tiglath Pilesar III. (B.C. 745-727), Sargon (B.C. 722-705), Sennacherib (B.C. 705-681), Esarhaddon I. (B.C. 681-668), and Assurbanipal (B.C. 668-626). The attempts at permanent conquest date from the reign of Sargon. The long reign of Assurbanipal falls into two periods, a former of great extension and conquest, and a latter when the tide began to turn and the Assyrian empire, overstrained and exhausted, showed signs of decay. Finally, in the reign of Esarhaddon II., Nineveh fell (B.C. 606), overwhelmed by a confederacy which included the Medes. Probably no empire was ever less lamented by the world at large, for we have the Assyrians’ own word for it that their warfare was attended with every circumstance of cruelty and horror. They hold indeed a bad pre-eminence in that respect over all the other nations of antiquity.', 'Religious rituals in Iran\nLife after death has been a major theme with all the religions and the passage from this life into the other has been dealt with in a variety of ways, depending on the particular belief system. The major religions of Iran can be divided into three distinct periods. Pre Zoroastrian or proto –Indo- Iranian, Zoroastrian and Islamic period. Around the third millennium B.C., proto-Indo-Iranians had become identifiable by speech as two distinct peoples, the Indians and the Iranians.\nPRE ISLAM & ISLAMIC RELIGIOUS RITUALS IN IRAN\nThe Iranians loaded with their Indo-Iranian traditions were also influenced by the powerful civilizations of the ancient Mesopotamia. Elements of Sumerian, Babylonian and Elamite belief systems were incorporated into the Iranians ideas of cosmos and life after death. Influenced as such, they believed there was no end for the world or for humans, which were thought to follow one another ceaselessly.\nThe world after was a continuation of the earthly life with no notions of heaven, hell, reward or punishment. After death the disembodied spirit, the ‘urvan’ (ravan in modern Persian) lingered on earth for three days before departing downward to a subterranean kingdom of the dead. This place was ruled over by Yima (Sanskrit Yama, Persian Jam/Jamshid in Shahnameh) who had been the first king to rule on earth and the first man to die.\nIn this kingdom spirits (urvans) lived a shadowy existence, and were dependent on their descendants on earth for survival. Offerings were made to feed and cloth them through rituals at specified times. Most were made during the first year, when the newly departed urvan was assumed to be lonely, and not yet fully accepted into the world of the dead. Offerings would be made by the dead person’s heir, usually the eldest son for up to thirty years, the span of a generation.\nThe first three days right after death were the most important of all. The soul was very susceptible to evil spirits at this time and needed strength and support to make it to the underworld. The soul would have to cross a dark river in a ferry to arrive in the kingdom of dead (Gilgamesh’s boat ride to reach immortality). This ‘Crossing of the Separator’ is called ‘Chinvato Peretu’ in the Avesta texts of the later periods. To help the departed soul, the family would pray, fast and make a blood sacrifice during the first three days. There would be ritual offerings to fire and at the third night deceased’s cloths would be blessed so that the dead person can start the journey fed and clad. Food offerings would be consecrated for thirty days and then once every thirtieth day, till the end of the first year. All together there would be three blood sacrifices at the first year, with annual offerings for the next thirty years.\nAfter the first year the soul was believed to be fully incorporated in the underworld. To sustain the souls of all departed relatives, general offerings were made once a year at the feast of All Souls. In Avesta this is called Hamaspathmaedaya. This feast was celebrated on the last night of the year. They believed the souls would visit their old homes at night and depart at sunset on New Year’s day. Funeral rites involved burial of the dead. Leading members of the family would be buried at the bottom of deep shafts covered by earthen barrows. Ordinary people would be laid in simple graves in the earth. The Zoroastrian word ‘dakhma’ comes from this period and means ‘grave’.\nSometimes toward the end of the third millennium BC, new ideas are incorporated into the belief system. There is hope that at least some people like the warriors, princes or the priests who have served the gods might escape this eternally joyless existence. If they behave well, do their prayers sacrifices and perform the expected rituals, their souls could join the gods. They would end up in a sunlit Paradise, where all imaginable delights are possible. “Crossing of the Separator’ becomes a bridge (Chinvat Bridge in Avesta, Sarat Bridge in Quran) with one end resting on the mountain peak of Hara, the other on the road to heaven. Only those worthy of paradise would cross, the rest would fall off and end in the subterranean kingdom of the dead.\nWith the hope of attaining paradise comes the idea of resurrection. After all, experiencing the joys of heaven in sprit only was not much of a reward! It was assumed that within the first year after death the bones of the dead would be raised up, clothed in immortal flesh and would be unified with the soul in heaven. The Indian funerary rite to cremation comes from this belief. The mortal flesh was destroyed quickly and the bones would be buried, ready for resurrection. The Iranians, regarding fire as a sacred entity adopted the rite of exposure instead. The corpse would be left in a barren place to be devoured by scavengers. The bones would be collected and buried with offerings and rituals.\nWith the coming of Zoroaster in the middle of the second millennium BC, major changes are introduced. Humans are created by he Lord of Wisdom (Ahura Mazda) to help other divinities to gradually overcome evil and restore world to its original perfect state. Therefore, the departed soul will be judged on what it has done to aid the cause of goodness. Attaining paradise becomes possible for all. Women as well as men, priests warriors servants and masters could all go to heaven. Chinvat Bridge becomes a place for moral judgment. People are judged not only on the basis of their offerings, prayers and sacrifices, but also on their ethical achievements.\nMithra presides over the tribunal; accompanied by Sraosha (Soroush) and Rashnu (Eyzad of Justice), who holds the scales of justice. In the Indian Veda the spirits are brought in by two dogs (messengers of Yama / Jam in Persian). In Avesta the two dogs await the spirits at the Chinvat Bridge. Dogs are still venerated by Zoroastrians and if possible are present at their funerals. Once judged, if the scales are heavier on the good side, the soul is lead by a beautiful maiden, the personification of its own conscience (‘daena’) to the paradise. If the scales sink on the bad side, the bridge becomes narrow, sharp and a horrid hag grabs the soul and plunges with it down to hell. The concepts of hell, a place of torment presided over by Angra Mainyu (Ahriman, Shaytan in Koran); heaven, resurrection and individual judgment are Zoroaster’s own. These doctrines deeply influenced the later religious developments in the area, i.e. Judo-Christian and Islamic traditions.\nThe funerary rites were more or less the same as before. Flesh would be left exposed for a while. Bones would be buried to await judgment day. The old belief survived that the soul lingered on earth for three days after death. Since each person’s deeds were responsible for his acceptance or denial into the heaven, the number of rites and observances performed on behalf of the dead by family members was reduced. Traditional Zoroastrians today still follow many of the same rites. Unless the death occurs late in the day or at night, the funeral follows in a few hours. At the funeral all dress in white. The shrouded corpse is never touched and simple ablution after the funeral will purify all participants who touch the bier. The White cloths are washed after each funeral. Specific hymns are recited and Avesta prayers are said to pay homage to Soroush. The rite of exposure is still performed if possible.\nThe processions are normally in complete silence. This is to avoid breaking the power of prayers read to Soroush. Once entering the dakhma the rest of the prayers will be recited in Avesta. The language is assumed to ward off evil spirits. Candles or oil lamps will be lit for three days next to the dead body. Special foods are prepared and no meat is consumed during the first three days. On the third day more rituals are performed, prayers are said, a special cloth (Sedra) is blessed to provide a spirit garment for the departed soul. Other minor rituals are performed during the first thirty days. The next major ones are on the thirtieth of the month, ‘siroza’ and one-year after, ‘sal’. In between the two ‘roza’, recitals of the Farvardin Yasht, the Hymn to All Souls is performed on a regular basis. Crying and other extreme expressions of sorrow are not normally practiced by the traditionalists. They believe such behavior (Mooye in Persian, Amyava in Avesta) belongs to the world of Ahriman and should be avoided.\nMuslim conquest of Iran introduced many changes. Quranic concepts of life after death go back to Jewish, and so indirectly, to Persian and ancient Babylonian sources. The world after is a place for judgment, reward or severe punishment. After death, the departed soul will remain in Barzakh (interworld) till Rastakhiz (resurrection). The hour of judgment comes at the end of the world with a mighty blow and blast of trumpets or an angel’s summons. The earth trembles, mountains quiver, the sea overflows its shores; the sun turns on its axis, the moon darkens and split in two. The stars hurtle to earth and the other world is revealed before the eyes of mankind. All humans are resurrected; the Divine Book is opened in which all human deeds are recorded.\nEvery human receives a list of his/her deeds to read aloud. If the book is placed in the right hand he/she is destined for heaven, if in the left hand, they are doomed to hell. Crossing of the Sarat Bridge will decide their final fate. Blessed ones will cross and end in heaven, for the doomed, the bridge becomes sharp narrow and they drop in hell. Allah is the ultimate source of power. He is the only creator therefore; he creates both good and evil. Since Shaytan (Satan) himself is a creation of Allah, human life is not about defeating the bad for the sake of the good. It is about submitting to God’s will, following the rules, codes of conduct and performing the prescribed rituals.\nFor this reason purely ceremonial prescriptions, such as ablutions before prayer, are put on exactly the same level as commandments of an elevated moral value, such as that of honesty. The major sins (Gonahan e kabireh) are not about being evil and do despicable acts. They are about not performing prayers (Namaz), avoiding Roozeh (fasting) or drinking wine. In other words not adhering to Allah’s commands. Ablutions and other rituals such as prayer (Namaz), fasting, pilgrimage to Mecca and paying the religious tax are the primary canonical duty of believers. As a result, many of the rites performed at the time of death are to compensate any shortcomings related to the above acts by the deceased while alive. The relatives ask for Allah’s forgiveness of the deceased by reciting prayer of death (Namaz e meyet). Mullahs are paid to perform all prayers that the deceased might have missed and fast for them. All religious taxes owed will have to be paid off.\nThe body should be buried within 24 hours. It will be washed, scented with Kafoor (used by Zoroastrians as well) and wrapped in a white cloth (Kafan). Since segregation of sexes is a fundamental institution in Islam women are not allowed to participate in the funeral of male relatives (Modern Iranians do not observe the segregation any more). At all times the body and the grave should face Mecca (Ghebleh). The graves should not be marked, since only the almighty himself is worthy of such respects. The memorial service (Khatm) is on the third day (reminiscent of Zoroastrian tradition). The next major days are one week (Hafteh), forty days (Cheleh) & one year after death (Sal). At all the gatherings participants will be served with special meals. Rich people will give ‘nazry’ (free food) to poor people. Such acts are regarded as good deeds (Savab) and there is the hope that the act will elevate the deceased’s status in the eyes of God.\nIn summary, the rituals of death in Iran like all other cultures are closely related to the concepts of life after death. With the ancient Iranians their fate in the after life was decided by their choice of good or evil. For the Muslims adherence to the God’s commands and total submission to ‘Allah’s will’ decides their fate. The Shiite Islam transcends death and martyrdom as a unique form of esotherism through which the true faith is re-enforced by the believers participating and re-enacting the tragic events of the martyred saints.\nIranian version of Shiite Islam introduced a new dimension into the death rituals. Imam Hussein’s fatal journey in Karbala and Ali’s assassination in Kufa have made martyrdom the most important communal ritual. The actual practices were copied and adapted from the Roman Catholic Church by the Safavid kings in the 16th century, but were given a different meaning. Christian martyrdom is based on the notion of redemption, Christ and the saints were martyred to redeem human sin. Shiite Saints are martyred to guarantee rule by descent from Prophet’s blood line (Fatima and her children). Shiites believe in the embodiment of a luminous divine substance in Prophet’s family. They are the only true leaders of the Muslim community. The martyrs are supreme heroes who vanquish enemies of the faith with their lives. To mourn and weep for them is considered highly meritorious- rather, it is the key to Paradise. Hussein’s death in particular forms the core of the rituals. Communal mourning takes place through out the country. Self mutilation, beating oneself with chains and the sword is to remind the pious Shiites of the pain and the horrors the martyrs went through. The death of Hussein is mourned with Passion plays, poetry and prose resounding with laments about the tragic fate of the Prophet’s beloved grandson.\nLively story telling heightens real incidents of the heroes’ lives. Gaps are filled with details that may or may not seem probable. A common tragedy unites all (rites of intensification). The martyr’s fidelity to God could never be questioned and they triumph in death. Small tablets and prayer beads made from the clay of Karbala and other items symbolizing the tragic incidents are passed around and carried by the believers to convey blessings. The physical bodies of the martyrs become accidental. Death becomes a vehicle through which the ‘true faith’, is not only revealed and survives, but also triumphs. Through the rituals the spirits of the martyrs are embodied and the bodies of the participants are spiritualized.']	['<urn:uuid:dc2bd805-7401-46f5-b4e7-4ef2a634a0e7>', '<urn:uuid:537761d1-7eb3-488e-82ac-2d031d624d21>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	24	137	4829

88	What are the depths of Antikythera wreck versus Titanic wreck?	The Antikythera wreck lies at a depth of around 180 feet (55 meters) below sea surface, while the Titanic wreck rests at a much greater depth of approximately 4 km. These different depths require different exploration approaches - the Antikythera site uses an Exosuit that can reach depths of 492 feet, while the Titanic requires submersibles for deep-sea exploration.	['Just when we thought that there weren’t any old world treasures left to be discovered from the depths of the oceans, a major underwater expedition conducted by an international group of deep sea divers and marine archaeologists, in the waters of the distant Antikythera island off the southern coast of Greece, has resulted in the recovery of some of the most astonishingly precious shipwreck treasures.A bit of historical background, before going any further. Although a tiny remote island with a modern-day population of only 44, Antikythera was an important trade route during antiquity and was also a base for Cilician pirates. It was here that one of the biggest shipwrecks of the ancient maritime history was discovered by a team of divers, off Point Glyphadia, in 1900. Records show that this huge Roman cargo vessel, dating as far back as 70-60 BC, sank some 2000 years ago after meeting with violent sea storm.\nHistorians believe that it was a commercial ship carrying looted Greek treasures from the coast of Asia Minor west all the way to Rome, quite possibly for the occasion of one of Julius Caesar’s triumphal parades. Fast forward to 1900, a group of sponge divers, headed by Captain Dimitrios Kondos, decided to halt at the island on their journey back from Africa, while waiting out a terrible storm. It was when they began diving in search of sponges that they came across one of the grandest ancient treasure troves.\nAmong the artifacts retrieved from the Antikythera wreck were four magnificent marble horses, ornate bronze statues, intricate glassworks, parts of antique furniture, jewelry and the spectacular “Antikythera mechanism” – a strange gear wheel-fitted bronze object that is believed to have been an ancient astronomical calculator and most likely, the world’s oldest computer! Talking about this mysterious device, Cardiff University professor Mike Edmunds said:\nIt is more complex than any other known device for the next 1,000 years.\nThe area of the wreck is located at a depth of around 180 feet(55 meters) below the sea surface, which meant that exploring the site was tricky and indeed very dangerous. The excavation work was completely stopped after the death of one of the divers. It was only in 2012 that the US-based Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute(WHOI) acquired permission from the Greek Government to conduct fresh searches at the island’s wreck site. The result is the Return to Antikythera mission, whose objectives include scouring the entire area using modern technologies and also confirming the presence of another ancient ship, about 820 feet(250 meters) away from the main site.\nDuring the first round, taking place between Sept. 15 and Oct. 7, 2014, an accomplished team of marine archaeologists, led by Brendan P. Foley, successfully conducted an extensive survey of the seafloor by means of 3-D mapping, with advanced autonomous underwater vehicle(AUV)-mounted cameras. The data collected have confirmed that the remnants are actually scattered across a much larger area, of up to 984 feet(300 meters).\nAmong the rescued artifacts are the ship’s anchors and hull planks, whose gigantic sizes prove that the Antikythera vessel was actually much larger than was previously believed and could as well have been up to 164 feet(around 50 meters) long. Foley was recorded saying:\nThe evidence shows this is the largest ancient shipwreck ever discovered…It’s the Titanic of the ancient world.\nOrdinary diving suits aren’t of much use at such great depths. Consequently, the high-tech Exosuit, designed by Canada-based Nuytco Recearch, is being utilized for this challenging underwater mission. Acting like a wearable submarine, this Iron Man-esque suit allows divers to safely reach a depth of about 492 feet(150 meters), a major leap from the maximum depth of 196 feet(60 meters) that divers could previously attain.\nMarine archaeologist Ed O’Brien became the first person ever to wear this futuristic Exosuit. Made from aluminium, this $588,000 bodysuit carries enough oxygen to last up to 50 hours. The WHOI website stated:\nWe will have more bottom time than any previous human visitors to the site, because we dive with mixed gas rebreathers…Each diver will have more than 30 minutes of bottom time per day, and will enjoy greater mental acuity and a larger safety margin than that of previous divers at Antikythera.\nThe remnants of the ship, together with a “bronze rigging ring” with wood fragments attached to it, indicate that much of the ship still survives and unfortunately remains unrecovered. The find includes a stunning table jug, an antique bed leg and most importantly, a 6.5 feet(2 meters) long bronze spear. Buried just below the seabed, this ornate spear is in fact too heavy and too large to have functioned as a real weapon. Instead, Foley believes that it most possibly adorned a huge ancient statue, perhaps of the Greek goddess Athena. Foley said:\nWe may find one or more monumental statues that were left behind in 1901, in the mistaken belief that they were rocks.\nThis underwater expedition has been one of the most promising works of its kind, with regards to ancient maritime history. Much of site, however, is still unexplored, which is why the team is gearing up to conduct another such mission next year. In this context, Theotokis Theodoulou of the Hellenic Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities had to say:\nWe have a lot of work to do at this site to uncover its secrets.\nTo learn more about the Return to Antikythera expedition, watch the following video:\nImage credits: Return to Antikythera website.', 'For millionaires who can enjoy unusual expeditions, the ocean is the next frontier. A video released last week by OceanGate Expeditions, an American commercial exploration company, shows the Titanic for the first time in 8K quality (much higher than the resolution of most TVs and computer screens) and offers a new opportunity for the marine exploration tourism industry.\nOceanGate Expeditions takes tourists in submersibles to shipwrecks and underwater canyons, The New York Times reports. For this summer’s Titanic expedition, lucky and intrepid travelers paid €250,000 to take a submersible approximately 4 km to where the infamous ship’s wreck rests.\nThe detail in the 8k footage will help our team of scientists and maritime archaeologists characterize the decay of the TitanicStockton Rush, OceanGate Expeditions president\nThe footage provides scenes of Titanic’s renowned bow, the portside anchor, hull number one, an enormous anchor chain (each link weighs approximately 200 pounds or nearly 91 kilograms), the number one cargo hold, and solid bronze capstans. Also captured is dramatic evidence of decay where some of the Titanic’s rail has collapsed and fallen away from the ship.\nThe unmatched quality of the image is expected to assist in determining the rate of decay for the Titanic as future expeditions capture new footage that can be compared year-after-year. With the help of scientists, the video will also support identification of species that are observed on and around the Titanic and archaeologists will be able to document elements of the wreck and debris field in greater detail.\n“This marriage of biology, ecology, archaeology and GIS mapping is making a unique contribution to the study of the Titanic and, perhaps more importantly, the ocean floor. Today, we have better maps of the surface of the moon than we have of the Earth’s oceans, and that must change,” said Steve W. Ross, Ph.D., chief scientist of OceanGate Expeditions.\nBecause like private space tourist trips, which in addition to their passengers can send scientific experiments into space that require microgravity environments, these expeditions also have scientific purposes. No public institution will finance research in the Ttanic, with more pressing problems that afflict society. It is up to the private sector to pick up the gauntlet.\n“We know that shipwrecks impact the ocean floor for decades or even centuries. Titanic provides a unique deep-sea case study of how man-made structures are affected by natural elements and inhabitants, plus how these structures support or influence marine ecosystems,” Ross said. “Titanic has created an island of biodiversity in an area that is otherwise a muddy abyssal plain. The fusion of these diverse areas of study that our science team brings to the Titanic Expedition will help us contribute to the study of our deep oceans as we share this data with the broader scientific and educational communities.”\nAccording to the NYT, OceanGate has led two expeditions to the site and has one planned for 2023. The dives last approximately eight hours, including the estimated 2.5 hours each way needed to descend and ascend. OceanGate Expeditions is already planning for the 2023 Titanic Expedition which will embark in May of 2023.']	['<urn:uuid:a76194ec-9a70-4725-a1f1-d7cb8c7a5a5c>', '<urn:uuid:b4374a3f-4494-4113-9e7f-98426ee6b508>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	10	59	1425
89	As researcher studying Japanese medical culture parallels low vs high hierarchy communication style east west	In Japanese medical culture, influenced by Bushido, there is high respect for hierarchy, with politeness (rei) being a key virtue requiring deference to elders and superiors. This contrasts with Western low-hierarchy cultures like Canada where challenging ideas is viewed positively. In high-hierarchy cultures like Japan, people tend to speak little in meetings and avoid challenging superiors' ideas out of deference, while Western low-hierarchy countries encourage direct communication and questioning.

The charter’s 3 principles (primacy of patient welfare, patient autonomy, and social justice) and 10 professional commitments5 are widely endorsed by international professional associations, colleges, societies, and certifying boards. However, we believe that the discussion of professionalism should also be related to the world’s different cultures and social contracts, respecting local customs and values even when they differ from Western ones.6 This is because the role of the physician is subject to cultural differences and dependent on the nature of the particular health care system in which medicine is practiced.6 As medical professionalism has mostly been considered from a Western perspective, there is a need to examine how the same, similar, or even different concepts are reflected in a wider range of cultural contexts.7\nIn Japan, professionalism is being discussed in a variety of forums, such as the Professionalism Committee of the Japanese Society of Medical Education and the Japanese Society of Internal Medicine.8 Questions have been raised about how to translate the mostly Western concepts of professionalism presented in international publications into the Japanese setting as well as how to tell the international community about unique Japanese concepts relating to medical professionalism. The very term professionalism, whose first meaning is “the conduct, aims, or qualities that characterize or mark a profession or a professional person,”9(p930) largely reflects a Western concept; there is no corresponding word in most Asian languages, including Japanese.10\nTo describe the views of some Japanese doctors on professionalism-related concepts, we have chosen Bushido as a value system, because it has much in common with Western virtue ethics; its meaning, “the way of the warrior,” is comparable to that of professionalism. It is a historical Japanese code of personal conduct originating from the ancient samurai warriors. In this article, we introduce the concepts of Bushido, compare them with Western concepts of medical professionalism—as represented by the physician charter mentioned earlier—and present views of some doctors now working in Japan about the continuing relevance (and occasional nonrelevance) of Bushido to their medical practices.\nThe Concepts of Bushido\nAlthough there are many books written about Bushido, the one by Inazo Nitobe,11 Bushido: The Soul of Japan, published in English in 1900, is a classic that is highly referenced in the international community. Nitobe describes Bushido as the code of moral principles that the knights (samurais) were required or instructed to observe. It is likened to chivalry and the noblesse oblige of the ancient warrior class of Europe. As in the martial arts of judo or karate, Bushido has a basis in Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shintoism.12 Though some cultural experts and scholars argue that the influence of Bushido on Japanese society has lessened,13 others say that the spirit of Bushido remains in the minds and hearts of the Japanese people.9,14 Although Bushido is not specific to medicine, some argue that it continues to influence the behavior of modern Japanese doctors.15\nThe seven principal virtues\nThe seven principal virtues in Bushido are rectitude (gi), courage (yu), benevolence (jin), politeness (rei), honesty (sei), honor (meiyo), and loyalty (chugi). Below, we describe each virtue in more detail. We have presented the virtues in the order given by Nitobe.\nThe first virtue, rectitude (gi), is considered the most fundamental virtue of the samurai. It is the way of thinking, deciding, and behaving in accordance with reason, without wavering. In a medical setting, this guides the doctor to what she or he should be doing; therefore, it is analogous to the concept of professionalism itself. It is also similar to the concept of altruism, as rectitude is usually meant as the antonym of seeking personal benefit. Furthermore, because the same Chinese character is used for rectitude and justice in Japanese writing, the concept of rectitude is also tied in with the concept of social justice. In an e-mailed survey of Japanese doctors that we carried out in 2012,* 117 of the 133 respondents (88%) agreed (by answering “strongly agree” or “agree”) that gi exists in their daily practices. Representative comments are “It is the value of justice or morality for doctors,” “I have sacrificed my private life because I am a doctor (so there is gi in me),” and “I would not work as a hospital doctor if I pursued financial benefit.”\nCourage (yu), the second virtue, meaning the spirit of daring and bearing (i.e., how one stands, walks, and behaves), is defined as doing what is right in the face of danger. In Bushido, the concept that righteous action speaks louder than words is highly valued. Whilst there is no analogous concept in the physician charter, yu can be understood to mean being unafraid to put the principles of professionalism into practice. Eighty-three respondents (62%) agreed to the existence of this virtue in their daily practices. Representative comments are “Doctors who went to rescue people suffering from the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami are good examples” and “Recently, I find it difficult to practice yu, as patients became more and more demanding.”\nThe third virtue, benevolence (jin), encompasses the concepts of love, sympathy, and pity for others and is recognized as the highest of all the attributes of the human soul. For doctors, that means practicing “medicine as a benevolent art,” as one respondent to the survey expressed it. The concept of benevolence is expressed as “patient welfare” or “altruism” in the physician charter, though the Bushido concept of jin is more emotional and linked to empathy. In the survey, 123 respondents (93%) agreed that jin is alive in their clinical practices. Representative comments are “Jin is absolutely necessary!!!” and “There is no medical practice without jin.”\nPoliteness (rei), the fourth virtue, is defined as respectful regard for the feelings of others. Nitobe11 said that rei “suffers long, and is kind; envieth not, vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up; does not behave itself unseemly; seeks not her own; is not easily provoked; takes no account of evil.” Although it may be one of the most influential concepts of the doctor–patient relationship in Japan, politeness is not described in the physician charter. We suggest that it is analogous to a commitment to maintaining appropriate relationships. In the survey, 111 respondents (83%) agreed that rei is important in their clinical practices. Representative comments are “I always try to show rei to patients,” “I cannot do medical practice without rei,” and “We must show rei as a member of society. It is a virtue that goes beyond medicine.”\nThe Chinese character for honesty (sei) combines the characters for “word” and “perfect.” The phrase bushi no ichi-gon means “the word of a samurai,” which is a guarantee of truth. This fifth virtue is a counterpart to the commitment to honesty in the physician charter, though Bushido places greater emphasis than the charter on spoken words. Therefore, doctors in Japan may be embarrassed when they orally tell something important to patients and then have to change it (which happens in daily clinical practice). In the survey, 94 respondents (71%) agreed that sei is important in their clinical practices. Some representative comments are “In most cases, I tell my patients the truth even though it is a bad news,” “Sei is fundamentally important,” and (a contrasting view) “Sometimes the end justifies the means.”\nHonor (meiyo), the sixth virtue, is recognized as the ultimate pursuit of goodness. Nitobe11 wrote, “The sense of meiyo could not fail to characterize the samurai, born and bred to value the duties and privileges of their profession.” By writing that “Death involving a question of meiyo was accepted in Bushido as a key to the solution of many complex problems,” Nitobe tried to explain the meaning of hara-kiri and seppuku; both are the classical types of suicide for samurai. We could draw a parallel with the concept of commitment to professional responsibilities, although there are some clear differences between the two; for example, doctors do not have to kill themselves as a result of unprofessional behavior. In the survey, 86 respondents (65%) agreed that meiyo is important in their clinical practices. Representative comments are “I feel meiyo to be a doctor,” “I do not know.… I do not care much about meiyo, to be honest,” and “Recently, I feel meiyo has lessened.”\nIn contrast to the individualism of the West, the Japanese have long valued loyalty (chu-gi) to the needs and interests of the group (e.g., family or hospital staff), placing the group’s needs above their own needs and interests. Bushido says that the interests of the family and the interests of its members are inseparable. Indeed, institutional loyalty is one of the factors that has encouraged Japan’s health care workforce to display values of altruism in patient care. Yet in the survey, only 62 respondents (47%) agreed that chu-gi is important in their clinical practices. Representative comments are “I feel chu-gi to my boss and the hospital I am working for,” “I weigh my personal benefit against the institutional one where I belong,” and “Recently, I feel fewer and fewer doctors feel chu-gi.”\nComparing Bushido and the Physician Charter\nBy comparing Bushido with the physician charter, we found that there are omissions, nuances, and blendings of words that create differences between the two in addition to the differences that are clearly there, which reminds us how meanings can be altered in translation and interpretation. Nevertheless, comparisons of Bushido and the physician charter can provide fresh insights into the understanding of professionalism. The charter calls for altruism from doctors, a concept that has a long tradition in Western thought.16 The Japanese way of upholding the primacy of patient welfare is to practice a blend of rectitude, benevolence, and loyalty. Similarly, although the concept of social justice per se may not prevail in the Japanese health care system, the concepts of rectitude, honor, and loyalty together represent social justice. For example, when these virtues work together within a universal health care system (i.e., one that covers everyone), they can motivate physicians to eliminate discrimination in health care.17\nThere are also several commitments in the physician charter that are not present in Bushido, because the charter describes medical professionalism, whereas Bushido describes a code of conduct for people in general. This difference can be seen in Table 1, which presents a comparison of the 7 virtues of Bushido and the 3 principles and 10 commitments of the physician charter.\nConcepts in Bushido That Differ From Contemporary Views of Professionalism\nExamples of differences\nAlthough Bushido is intrinsically intertwined with the values of Japanese society,2 it has concepts that differ from—and sometimes conflict with—contemporary notions of professionalism. Bushido does not address the autonomy of the individual, which is one of the principles in the physician charter. This omission may encourage paternalistic relationships between doctors and patients in Japan; such relationships are increasingly considered unacceptable in Western culture. In the chapter on self-control, which is an associated virtue in Bushido, Nitobe11 stated that the Japanese were required not to show their emotions to others, expressed in the phrase “He shows no sign of joy or anger.” Although this behavior might be considered an appropriate trait in Japan, it can cause miscommunication between doctors and patients. Inequality between men and women is another example, rooted in Bushido, where the roles of women were classified as naijo, the “inner help” of the home. With the recent influx of women into Japanese medicine, such challenges as maintaining work–life balance (e.g., through flexible work arrangements) are transforming the traditional concept of Japanese work ethics and provoking intergenerational discussions that are shaping the present-day view.18\nFactors behind the differences\nMany factors account for differences between Bushido and the physician charter. An important factor is religion. For example, although the social contract between medicine and society is very important in discussing medical professionalism,6 the concept of a “social contract” is foreign to Japanese culture (and probably other non-Judeo-Christian cultures), as it implies a covenant based on Judeo-Christian principles. Another example: In Confucian cultures like Japan, young people are expected to show respect for elderly people. Demonstrating politeness (rei) to an older person calls for a type of deference on the part of a doctor that might not be seen in Western cultures.\nThe extent to which a culture values individualism is another factor influencing the professionalism of doctors.19 Loyalty (chu-gi) motivates doctors to give greater weight to the interests of the group in cultures like Japan’s that value a collective approach.\nA final, and very basic, difference between the physician charter and Bushido is that the former is founded in an ethical system based on duty and rules, whereas Bushido is founded in virtue ethics,20 which concerns the character of the actor. In ethical systems based on duties and rules, one judges whether a course of action is ethical or not according to its adherence to ethical principles, focusing on doing, whereas virtue ethicists judge whether an action is ethical according to the character trait the actor embodies, focusing on being. Virtue ethics has attracted increased interest in the field of general philosophy in recent years and has also entered into discussions about medical professionalism,21 such as this one.\nA Call for Multicultural Perspectives on Professionalism\nWhile recognizing that Bushido was in full force at a particular time and place in Japanese history and culture and is by no means a comprehensive ethical system, we suggest that its concepts are applicable to discussions of medical professionalism for those teaching and practicing in Japan today, and merit further study. Given the pace of globalization, which can easily cause the hegemonic imposition of Western culture and discourage cultural diversity, we hope this article will encourage a richer discussion, from the viewpoints of different cultures, on the meaning of professionalism in today’s health care practice.\nAcknowledgments: The authors wish to thank Dr. Yoshiyasu Terashima for taking part in a symposium, “Bushido and Medical Professionalism in Japan,” with Hiroshi Nishigori at the 39th annual meeting of the Japan Society for Medical Education.

During the examination, the witness avoids her gaze and dodges her questions. Indeed, Agatha struggles to get direct and concise answers. It doesn’t take much else for her to conclude that the witness is lying to her, but is that really the case?\nThere are many differences in language, gender or culture that influence the quality of our dealings with our clients, colleagues and even opposing parties. These differences also colour our interpretation of certain behaviours. In a context of globalization, which brings many changes such as increased trade and interdependence at the political, social and economic levels, cultural skills are undeniably major assets that lawyers in all fields of law must possess.\nThis article has three objectives: to define the concepts of culture and cultural competence, to provide food for thought on your cultural skills and the main obstacles to communication and, finally, to suggest preventive measures to avoid misunderstandings underlying cultural differences.\nCulture and Cultural Competence: Some Definitions\nIn this article, we will take a broad view of the concept of culture. More specifically, culture refers to any behaviour or value of an individual in relation to his or her identity characteristics. In addition to ethnicity, identity characteristics include: the individual’s gender, sex, age, sexual orientation, religious beliefs and intellectual and physical abilities.\nSimilarly, we understand cultural competence to mean an individual’s ability to maintain his or her effectiveness in a context marked by cultural differences, as well as his or her ability to understand and adapt to these differences. In other words, cultural competence not only requires an awareness of cultural differences, it also requires an active engagement in learning and adaptive behaviours to maintain healthy relationships with our culturally diverse clients.\nAssessment of My Cultural Competence\nHumans are made in such a way that it is easier for us to relate to individuals who are like us. Each lawyer therefore has his or her own level of comfort with diversity.\nWe propose to identify your stage of cross-cultural sensitivity and emotional competence with the help of the Development Model of Intercultural Sensitivity designed by Dr. Milton Bennett. Dr. Bennett identified the following six stages of cultural competence:\nStage 1: Denial\nThis refers to lawyers who overlook the cultural dimension of their business relationships. They ignore the differences that may still exist with respect to values, beliefs, taboos and communication styles. In general, lawyers at this stage find it difficult to build trusting relationships with clients from different cultures. Similarly, there are more conflicts and misunderstandings caused by a lack of understanding of cultural differences.\nStage 2: Defence\nLawyers at this stage acknowledge the existence of cultural differences, but view them negatively. In other words, instead of trying to understand behaviour that is different from their own, they criticize the behaviour or make a false or stereotypical judgment.\nStage 3: Minimization of difference\nAt this stage, lawyers recognize cultural and linguistic diversity. Nonetheless, they consider their own values and beliefs to be universal and superior to those of others. When interacting with culturally different clients, they tend to misinterpret the clients’ behaviours or opinions in the mistaken belief that the clients share their own values.\nSuch lawyers will face many communication barriers due to their propensity to minimize the importance of the cultural differences that may exist between them and their clients.\nStage 4: Acceptance of difference\nLawyers at this stage are aware of the cultural differences that exist and grasp the importance of understanding them to improve the quality of their relationships and the effectiveness of their communications with their clients. In other words, the relationship between the lawyers and their culturally different clients is respectful and free of negative bias. The lawyers’ flexibility and open-mindedness allows them to adequately analyze the needs of culturally different clients.\nStage 5: Adaptation to difference\nAt this stage, lawyers not only perceive cultural differences, but also interact skillfully within those differences. In other words, they adapt!\nStage 6: Integration of difference\nAt this stage, lawyers have become experts in interpreting their clients’ behaviours according to their cultural framework. They pay particular attention to both verbal and non-verbal language.\nPlease rest assured that this is in no way a value judgment on a particular stage. On the contrary, identifying the stage we are at, even if it is not the desired one, allows us to identify our strengths and weaknesses. In fact, it’s about raising awareness so that we can target the actions that need to be taken to perfect our communications with culturally different clients. This leads us to end this section by sharing a quote from Shunmyo Masuno, a Buddhist monk, on open-mindedness: “If you debate endlessly about black or white, you fail to see the beauty of grey”.\nCultural Differences and Barriers to Good Communication\nLet’s look at three cultural differences that may arise in your daily practice and that are the source of many misunderstandings.\nHigh-hierarchy vs. low-hierarchy cultures\nDuring a meeting with a client to explain his opinion on the file, Max has difficulty getting clear instructions from the client. Despite Max’s encouragement, the client asks few questions, simply stating that he understands. Is the client merely shy or is there a cultural element involved?\nThe question is relevant. In high-hierarchy cultures, a high degree of respect is shown to individuals who have certain characteristics such as age, gender, education, type of employment, workplace seniority, etc. Thus, out of deference, people who adhere to this type of culture speak little in meetings or ask permission before speaking. They also tend to avoid challenging the ideas of those they perceive as hierarchically superior.\nConversely, in low-hierarchy cultures, individuals view challenging ideas positively, as long as opinions are expressed with respect.\nIt should be noted that low-hierarchy countries are the minority. Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom are countries with a low-hierarchy culture.\nCulture of direct vs. indirect communication\nMarie, a family law lawyer, meets for the first time with a new female client who is married, is 35 years old and has two children. The client arrived in Canada less than a year ago and has difficulty expressing herself in English. Based on her discussion with the client, Marie perceives that the client seems to be emotionally abused by her spouse and wants a divorce. Despite a frank and direct question about the client’s intentions, the client evades the question.\nThe way in which people communicate also varies from one culture to another. For some, conversations are “cloaked” in the sense that metaphors, references to culturally shared norms or examples are used to express one’s thoughts. Indeed, cultures that favour indirect communication perceive direct communication as inappropriate or crude. Cultures favouring indirect communication are mostly found in ethnically homogeneous countries.\nConversely, in countries with great diversity, communication tends to be direct to ensure that the other person has understood the meaning of what is being said. Canada is an excellent example of a culture of direct communication.\nGroup vs. individual culture\nHarold, a litigation lawyer, is at a settlement conference with his client. His analysis of the case suggests it is in his client’s favour and the judge seems receptive to their position. Despite his recommendations to try to obtain higher monetary compensation, the client is more concerned about obtaining a letter of apology and re-establishing the business relationship with the opposing party.\nSo-called group cultures place greater importance on the interests of the group as opposed to individual interests. Collaboration and consensus building is common. Conflicts must be avoided and social cohesion is paramount.\nIndividualistic cultures value the defence of individual rights and interests.\nBy being sensitive to cultural differences, it is possible to see the misunderstandings and errors that can result.\nSome Preventive Measures...\nIn light of the above, here are some preventive measures to improve how you communicate with culturally diverse clients:\n- Be aware of your biases and thought patterns. During a meeting with a culturally different client, ask yourself what certain behaviours mean and how your own cultural context influences your interpretation. Avoid assuming that a gesture has the same meaning as in your culture.\n- Don’t underestimate the role of stress. Anxiety negatively influences the interpretation of events and behaviours by both lawyers and clients. So, in times of stress, why not take a step back to ensure that your interpretation is accurate and free of bias? As far as the client is concerned, encourage breaks if the conversation becomes anxiety-provoking. These breaks will allow the client to better assimilate information and make well-thought-out decisions.\n- Allow sufficient time for the client during your meetings. When planning a meeting, allow time to answer all of the client’s questions and work to dispel preconceived ideas, if any.\n- Practice active listening techniques. Make your client understand that you are attentive to the problem they are presenting to you, in particular by rewording certain sentences. In all cases, it is important to reserve judgment and validate your understanding.\n- Adapt your language. Two people may face a similar legal problem but have different language needs due to cultural differences. The person with a low level of education will appreciate clear, concise and jargon-free language. Conversely, a client who is a businessman involved in his tenth business transaction might find this language too simplistic. Another illustration is that of a client from a culture where communication is indirect. This client may be uncomfortable with your direct approach.\n- Avoid assuming that something is simple and that you don’t have to explain it. Some clients, out of fear of demonstrating ignorance or out of deference, do not ask any questions. They claim to have understood everything, when in fact this is not true! It is therefore crucial that you ensure clients understand all relevant information so they can make informed decisions in their case.\n- Encourage clients to ask questions. Through their questions, clients will provide you with valuable insights into their understanding of the case. It is suggested that lawyers replace the so-called “closed” questions such as “Do you understand?” or “Is my strategy the right one for you?” with “open” questions such as “What do you think of the proposed strategy?”.\n- Be proactive. Learn about different cultures. For example, find out about business etiquette before attending a meeting involving culturally different people.\nTo return to our original issue about the importance of cultural competence, it goes without saying that cultural competence remains essential to effectively target client needs and expectations. In an era of increased individual mobility and competitiveness within firms, cultural competence contributes to providing good client service. It is therefore not irrelevant to reflect on how to improve this type of competence.\nMe Nora Rock, Cultural Competence: an essential skill for success in an increasingly diverse world, Lawpro Magazine, 2014, vol. 13, no. 2.

90	I'd like to know which types of students face more challenges - are silent learners in language classes more at risk for negative outcomes compared to students with disabilities in social situations?	Students with disabilities face significantly greater challenges. While silent learners in language classes may be actively learning through listening and attention, students with disabilities are three times more likely to experience bullying than their non-affected peers, with studies showing that almost one-third of all students are involved in bullying either as victim or perpetrator. Students with disabilities often remain isolated from peer groups, leading to reduced opportunities to make connections, practice social skills, lower self-esteem, and decreased desire to interact with others. In contrast, recent research shows that silent learners in language classes can effectively learn new grammar and vocabulary by focusing their attentional resources on listening to peers.	"['Guest contributor: Jihoon Kim\nJihoon is a master’s student in Second Language Education through McGill University’s Department of Integrated Studies in Education. Jihoon’s research interests include peer interaction in the language classroom.\nIn North America, communicative approaches to language teaching prevail in most second language instructional settings. Go and check a second language textbook made for North American language learners; you will find that it is filled with communicative activities such as information-gap activities, interviews, consensus-building activities, and role-plays. Usually these activities are designed to be carried out in either pairs or small groups, but teachers often complain that pair or group work yields too much off-task behaviour. Thus, we feel that time spent on pair or group work is not productive, and sometimes we are tempted to skip it. However, recent studies in second language acquisition (SLA) shed new light on some off-task behaviours that commonly occur during pair/group work and make the case that they are not always harmful to language learning. In this post, I will discuss three of them.\n1. Silent Learners\nSLA research informed by cognitive psychology have characterized silent learners as ‘shy,’ ‘unmotivated,’ ‘disengaged,’ or ‘uninterested.’ Some socially-informed scholars (such as Norton, 2001) argue that learners’ silence is not an indicator of personality or interest level but is rather a sign that displays how learners’ participation is socially constructed and sanctioned. For example, immigrant children in the host country’s school system often experience a sense of exclusion from their peers, which deprives them of opportunities to practice the L2 in a meaningful social context. Although socially-informed and cognitivist scholars characterize silent learners differently, both still maintain the position that active participation helps language learning. In other words, the majority of SLA researchers agree that remaining silent does not contribute to language learning.\nHowever, Dobao’s recent study (2016) reveals that although silent learners do not display visible participating behaviour during small group work, some of them are actually paying close attention to what other group members are saying and learning new grammar and vocabulary by listening. Dobao claims that silent learners spend their limited attentional resources on closely listening to others instead of expending those resources on active participation. Thus, we should be cautious of labeling silence as off-task behaviour, since some of our silent students are engaged and actively listening.\nTeachers all know learners who love to make amusing remarks during lessons. Sometimes these learners lighten up the classroom mood and make a lesson more dynamic. Generally, however, they are regarded as disruptive and destabilizing (i.e., side-tracking the lesson), and their behaviour is interpreted as a sign of boredom or resistance. Nevertheless, some SLA researchers argue that some of the amusing remarks, specifically language play (spontaneous playful use of some aspect of language, such as puns), are a sign of learners’ language awareness, which is linked to metalinguistic knowledge.\nAhn (2016) investigated a group of young Korean learners of English at a summer immersion camp in Korea and observed learners making amusing remarks drawn from the phonological similarity between Korean and English and from altering the meaning of English words. She argues that their undirected word play is a sign that they are engaged with language learning and showcases their language awareness. As Ahn points out, however, when an episode of language play occurs, teachers either are unaware of the connections learners are making or simply ignore it as side-talk. Thus, most episodes of language play are not used as a pedagogical tool, when in fact, we could draw attention to them and use them to raise learners’ metalinguistic awareness, for example, by highlighting similarities and differences between languages.\nThis is probably the most common off-task behaviour a teacher can observe during group work. As soon as the teacher puts learners into groups, they often begin to talk about a range of topics that are not related to the task at hand, such as things they read on the Internet, gossip, and their past experiences. Even though socializing is highly natural for human beings, off-task socializing is frowned upon by teachers as a waste of time.\nHowever, a recent study (Martin-Beltran et al., 2016) paints a slightly different picture of learners’ socializing behaviour. In this study, Martin-Beltran and her collaborators investigated an English-Spanish two-way language learning situation where learners of different proficiency levels were reciprocally learning languages. The researchers observed that those small groups that frequently exchanged relationship-building remarks (questions about other group members’ experiences; acknowledgement of shared experiences or feelings; words of encouragement) also engaged more in language related talk, such as questioning grammar usage or word meaning. This meta-talk (collaborative verbal construction of metalinguistic knowledge), helps learners grasp new language items or consolidate existing knowledge. Thus, the authors conclude that when a learning task calls for collaboration among members, it is natural for learners to socialize, but since groups that socialized also engaged in more productive discussion of language, ignoring the social aspect of language learning may end up depriving students of opportunities for learning.\nThe above-mentioned examples show that not all off-task behaviour is undesirable for learning. However, it is difficult for teachers to discern truly off-task behaviours from those are not, since interpreting learners’ behaviour is highly context dependent. Thus, it is up to individual teachers to identify the nature of behaviours and discern whether they may actually help productivity.\nDoes knowing the potential pedagogical value of silence, jokes involving language play, and socializing influence your attitude toward these behaviours? What are some signals that you would look for to discern between truly off-task behaviours and behaviours that actually have positive effects on learning?\nPlease note that the Ramblings of a Linguaphile site is currently being used for thesis research.

91	how do banyan flowers work	The banyan's flowers are hidden inside the fig. These very small blossoms, hundreds of them, spend their entire lives inside the fig. They are pollinated by a special species of fig wasp that enters the fig through a natural hole, lays eggs inside, and when the insects hatch and leave, they become covered with pollen which they carry to fertilize blossoms in other figs.	['Banyan Tree Theosophy\nThe English name for the banyan tree derives from the fact that in ancient times there were such trees in the vicinity of the Persian Gulf. Banias (or merchants) from India would camp there when they visited and gave to these great arbours their name. There are many tales of ghosts and spirits associated with their often strange shapes and people tend to be afraid of them in the dark. The most outstanding characteristic of the banyan is the fact that it frequently germinates in another tree and drops its roots down to the ground. A bird may drop a seed in the leaves of a palm or other forest tree, where it grows and sends down long rope-like roots that gradually thicken and embrace the host tree. This epiphytic pattern is looked upon by Hindus as a holy union but it marks the beginning of a long struggle between the so-called strangling fig and its host. From as high up as one hundred feet the roots grow around and band the trunk of the host until eventually, after many years or even decades, the host will die, leaving the banyan supported by roots that are often as large as great and sturdy trunks. Though not a parasite, the strangler figs flourish at the expense of other trees.\nThe banyan and the Ashwatha tree combine the elements of cosmic sacrifice and eternal life or Wisdom. But the sacrifice of the banyan exacts the sacrifice of a host in order to spread and take root. One might imagine the host tree as man, whose spirit is reaching up towards the source of life. The Vital Force moves heavenward within him like the spiritual serpent entwining the caduceus and provides the seat in the brain where the seed of Wisdom can germinate. The conscious spirit of man, like the bird, flies up in willing sacrifice, knowing that its lower nature will eventually have to die. In this way man becomes a host of the earthbound Great Sacrifice which, once rooted, will provide a canopy of shade and shelter to multitudes of other struggling souls. Eventually, after the sacrificial tree or the wood of the earthy man is dead, there will be only the sacrifice left. That which was breathed down as the Great Breath has been inhaled and breathed forth by a human agent, and in this way the inspiration and expiration of the Vital Force binds together heaven and earth.\nOf the banyan tree it is said: “Under the protecting foliage of this king of the forests, the Gurus teach their pupils their first lessons on immortality and initiate them into the mysteries of life and death.” This links up with the mysteries represented by the Ashwatha tree, which suggest that when it touched the earth it became soiled and the Serpent of Eternity (the Logos) was degraded. The likening of the trunk of the Ashwatha to the caduceus reminds one that the two serpents of spirit and matter (life and death) descend along its trunk, and their tails joining below produce the maya of worldly existence. This is all very suggestive and ancestral to the fragmented symbolism illustrated by the tree and the serpent in the Book of Genesis. All the more does this rendition of the ancient myth seem distorted and diminished when one compares it to the arcane teaching that “those who dwell in the microcosmic tree are the Serpents of manifest Wisdom”. In fact, man is this tree and the serpents represent his higher Manas, the link between heaven and earth.\nIn Hindu mythology, the banyan tree is also called kalpavriksha meaning ‘wish fulfilling tree’. It represents eternal life because of its seemingly ever-expanding branches and people have great respect for it. There are many stories about it in ancient literature\nBanyan trees are sacred in South Asia, particularly to Hindus and Buddhists. The tree features in many myths. The tree represents eternal life because it supports its expanding canopy by growing special roots from its branches. These roots hang down and act as props over an ever widening circle, reflecting the Sanskrit name bahupada, meaning ‘one with many feet’.\nIn Hinduism the banyan tree represents immortality and there are many stories about it in ancient literature. In a song called the ‘Bhagavad Gita’ or ‘Song of the Lord’, Krishna uses the banyan tree as a symbol to describe the true meaning of life to the warrior hero Arjuna. Banyan is viewed by Hindus as the male plant to the closely related peepul or bodhi tree (Ficus religiosa). It is regarded as a sin to destroy either of these trees. It is commendable for a person to plant a young banyan close to a peepul, and this is done with a ceremony similar to that of marriage. It is customary to place a piece of silver money under the roots of the young banyan.\nBanyan is mentioned in the Buddhist Jataka tales. In the tale of Satyavan and Savitri, Satyavan lost his life beneath the branches of a banyan. Savitri courageously entered into a debate with Yama, the God of Death, and won his life back. In memory of this couple, in the month of Jyestha during May and June, the tree is celebrated. Married women visit a banyan and pray for the long life of their husbands.\nThe tree is associated with the life of the 15th century saint Kabir. A giant tree is said to have sprung from a twig he had chewed. People of all religions use its great leafy canopy to meditate or rest. It is said that the wise Markandeya found shelter under it during a torrential downpour.\nMinor deities such as yakshas (tree spirits), Kinnaras (half-human, half-animal) and gandharvas (celestial musicians) are believed to dwell in the branches on banyan trees. Ghosts and demons are also associated with its branches, because it is believed that many spirits are harboured in the banyan.\nBanyan Tree Ficus Benghalensis\nA single mature Banyan Tree will have many trunks and support roots which gives the appearance of a forest of separate trees. A single tree can spread to cover well over an acre, the largest, in Sri Lanka, covers just over two acres.\nHeight: up to 30.5 meters.\nLifespan: possibly over a thousand years although the age of the Banyan Tree is difficult to determine due to the fact that the original trunk is usually hidden by years of arial or support root growth.\nHabitat and Range: grows in India and adjacent countries. It prefers areas of high humidity and moist soils.\nRoots in the Air\nBanyan Trees have aerial roots – running from branches to the ground – which enable trees to become very large – up to 200 metres in diameter\nWe know that all fruit must have a blossom – or do they?\nSometimes the Banyan fig is called a fruit without a flower. This is nonsense of course. But- where are the blossoms?\nYou will need better eyes than even our Shikra hawk to find a Banyan flower. That’s because they are hidden inside the fig.\nThe blossoms are very small and hundreds of them spend their entire lives inside the fig.\nThe flowers have a unique friend called a fig wasp. Each kind of Ficus (fig tree) has its own special species of wasp attached to it. The wasp’s job is to pollinate the fig flowers.\nThe wasp enters the fig through a natural hole in the top and lays its eggs. When the insects hatch and leave their home they become covered with pollen. Then they make their way into another fig and fertilize its blossoms, making sure it will produce seeds.\nBanyan trees are important as shady gathering places and they feature strongly in South Asian mythology. They also provide a source of shellac and dye.\nShellac is an important ingredient in French polish. Shellac is produced by lac insects which parasitise banyan trees.\nBanyan – Traditional Medicine\nVarious parts of the banyan tree are used in traditional forms of South Asian medicine. The sap is frequently used. it is applied externally to treat inflamed skin and bruising. Infusions of the plant are also prepared to treat a variety of conditions. Research is now being conducted to find out if there is any scientific evidence to support its traditional use.\nBanyan as a Remedy\nReports show that the whole leaf is applied to the external parts of the body that are red and inflamed. In Ayurvedic, Unani and Siddha medicine, the milky latex from the stems and leaves of the banyan tree is applied to bruises and to parts of the body that are causing pain. The feet are frequently treated to decrease pain.\nInfusions of the bark and seeds are used in Ayurvedic medicine as a tonic and to cool the body, whereas infusions of the bark have been traditionally used to treat patients with diabetes.\nSkin ulcers are treated with a paste made from mixing water with ground plant material from the aerial roots of the tree. Healers make a dilute drink from the latex to treat children suffering from dysentery.\nMany parts of the tree are used in caring for teeth. For example, the latex is applied to the gums to treat toothache and twigs are sold as toothpicks in markets in parts of India and Pakistan. These twigs can be used to physically clean the teeth and they are chewed to help keep the teeth clean and also to prevent gum diseases. Companies in India now make extracts from the twigs and bark of the banyan tree to make toothpaste and tooth powders.\nBanyan – Western Medicine\nDespite the significance of this plant in the culture of India very little is known about the chemical composition of the latex and the active compounds in the different parts of the plant. Scientists are now starting to investigate its potential.\nResearchers in India and Pakistan have been collaborating with scientists in other parts of the world to study the plant so that they can explore the science behind the traditional uses.\nThe main focus for research has been on the use of the banyan tree for the treatment of diabetes. So far, some compounds called leucocyanids have been isolated from the tree and these compounds could be associated with the anti-diabetic activity of the plant. However, more research needs to be completed to understand the medicinal properties of this symbolic tree.\nThe plant is not reported as being used medicinally in Europe and there are no documented cases in the literature of toxicity from its use in Britain.']	['<urn:uuid:599bf2da-6a64-48d4-950c-2a7f26f65e47>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	5	64	1775
92	what permissions asset managers have investing	Asset managers may be granted limited authorization to buy and sell investments on behalf of their clients, typically after establishing a long-term trusted relationship. However, clients always retain the ability to override the manager's suggestions and take different actions if they choose.	['Learn something new every day\nMore Info... by email\nAsset managers are individuals who are responsible for overseeing the performance of the financial assets of their clients. This often includes the management of any stock holdings, bond issues, real estate, or other assets that the client possesses. An asset manager will seek to find the ideal balance between incurring risk and earning returns from investments, thus increasing the value of the client’s portfolio. Managers of this type may work for brokerage firms or function as independent managers who work for private clients.\nThe typical asset manager focuses on the process of investment management. This involves monitoring the performance of any stocks, bonds, or other securities that a client has in his or her financial portfolio. As part of the management process, the asset manager will make recommendations regarding which investments to hold on to over the long term, which ones should be sold within a given period of time, and which new stock or bond offerings should be acquired for the portfolio. The goal is to maximize the return on all assets contained in the portfolio, while keeping the level of risk associated with the investment process within the limits determined by the client.\nAlong with managing investments like stocks and bonds, an asset manager may be called upon to manage real estate holdings that are owned by the client. This can involve making sure the properties remain profitable and advising the client when to sell those assets and convert the proceeds into other forms of investments. The manager will often counsel the client when to make improvements to the properties, as a means of positioning the client to ultimately earn more benefit from those real estate holdings.\nDepending on the relationship between the asset manager and the client, the manager may be granted limited authorization to engage in buying and selling on behalf of the client. This is often the case when the business relationship has been established for some time, and the client has come to trust both the expertise and the integrity of the manager. However, it is important to understand that the client always has the ability to override the suggestions of the manager, and take an alternate course of action, if he or she desires.\nIn order to function as an asset manager, it is necessary to have an eye for detail, since the tasks associated with the work focus on keeping an ongoing accounting of the assets of the client. The manager must also be well-versed in understanding how various investment markets work, and be able to identify upcoming trends that will have an impact on the value of the client’s investment portfolio. It is also important that the asset manager understand all laws and regulations currently in place that relate to investing and trading options. This helps to ensure that the client always complies with those standards when executing any type of financial transaction that involves the assets placed in the care of the manager.']	['<urn:uuid:25a5760b-5da5-4b62-a57a-0035109e1a9f>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	6	42	502

94	paper document version tracking compare electronic system version tracking	Traditional paper documents made version tracking difficult and inconsistent, with manual updates needed in multiple locations. Modern document management systems can automatically track various versions of documents, recording all changes along with the person making the change and the date and time, while also ensuring only one current version is available in the main storage location.	"['In this part I set out to offer some simple suggestions to make versioning of documents predictable and understandable, which will make the documents themselves more accessible.\nThe following small set of rules on versioning can greatly improve the quality and traceability of your documents. In summary, these are:\n- Use only one versioning system for all your project\'s artefacts.\n- Use a document properties to record version information\n- Maintain documents in a networked location, and use URLs.\n- No embedded documents\n- Remove older versions out of the way.\n- No version information in file-names.\n- Use a project librarian\n- Make documents easy to get by making them easy to produce properly.\nThe first 5 of these is covered in detail below, and then in part 3 I will discuss the last 3 and how to make things even easier by using a dedicated revisioning tool – i.e. the one your software developers use – for your documents too.\nUse only one versioning system for all your project\'s artefacts.\nThis might sound obvious, but it\'s not always the case in practice. Different contributors to your project will have different understandings of what each designation.\n- Version 0.9 to some is just a version number on a draft document, but to others it\'s reserved for the version that\'s to be sent out for approval.\nFINALmeans a completely finished document to me, but some colleagues have used it to say this version is the last one to be published to get the very last approvals\n_v0.5_JDCommentsis version 0.5 marked up with comments by John Doe. To me, this is not a new version, though I\'ve seen others regard it as one (i.e. send it around as a version to be reviewed, rather than incorporating the comments into\nThe versioning system you use should be simple, so that all interested people don\'t have to try to remember loads of different rules. One recommendation is to separate the mechanism you use to distinguish one version of a document from another, and the mechanism you use to identify the stage the document is at.\nx.2, etc. denote documents in draft, incrementing with each new version that is published. These will continue incrementing (\nx.100, etc.) until the document has been fully approved.\n1.0denotes the first fully approved version of the document.\n2.0is the second fully approved version. And so on. If an approved document is to be amended, then the minor number is to be incremented (\n1.3, etc.) until that version has been approved (at which point the major number is incremented and the minor reset to\n- The status of the document is represented more clearly,\nthough.

In\nfact, I prefer a simpler arrangement: version numbers are just\n4, etc.), and the document state is the\nonly indicator of the document\'s progression.\nUse a document property – where supported – to store the document\'s version information\nAs it makes more than just sense for the version information of a document to be expressed somewhere within the document, one often finds it in multiple locations: title page, page footers, page headers, introductions, etc.\nIf these are each individually typed into the document, then each time the version is to change, it needs to be manually edited in all places in the document where it\'s expressed. Some people will miss some instances, and others will decide that it doesn\'t need to be updated until, say, a certain milestone is achieved. Both of these scenarios are problematic.\nMicrosoft Word, LibreOffice Writer, OpenOffice.org Writer and many other document editing utilities allow for the configuration of fields that can be set in the document\'s properties and then referenced throughout the document\'s text. If the author updates this ""field"" or property and then instructs the document to update all references to it, all expressions of the document\'s version within it will be updated.\nMaintain the document in a networked location, and use links.\nDon\'t let documents be sent around as attachments to e-mails. No matter how hard you try, there is no way to make sure that all relevant people will pull up the correct version of all documents at all times. If, however, you send only a link to the document, then all recipients of your notification will pull up the linked-to document (if they haven\'t saved it off somewhere!).\nIn order to reinforce this I often put the following statement in a prominent location of a document:\nThis document is maintained at\n<documentAddress>. The only official version of this document is at that address. If you are reading this document from some other location, you are advised to retrieve it from the above address in order to ensure that you have the most up-to-date version.\nIn this scenario, copies and printouts of documents are immediately obsolete, not necessarily because the official version is immediately different, but because the copy or printout cannot track any updates to the official version.\nIn addition to this, I would strongly recommend that everyone in the organisation have (at least) read-only access to the location where the document is being maintained without having to raise a specific request for this. This is very important. If there is no compelling reason to restrict access on documents to legitimate members of the organisation, then all documents should be accessible to all users without the need for instance-by-instance granting of permission. It\'s bad enough if someone has to supply a username and password every time they want to read a document, it\'s worse when that person has to wait a number of days to be supplied with a username and password. In this case, a number of risks arise:\n- A legitimate reviewer of the document can\'t review it;\n- Your deliverable is delayed while you await the granting of access;\n- Or your reviewer has to provide comment on an unofficial, obsolete version of the document that had to be e-mailed to them (see above).\nThis latter risk is especially important, as it might seem minor, but without rigorous application of your rules, it is the slippery slope that will make a networked location of the documents pointless.\nThink open: unless you have a good reason to hide it, you shouldn\'t allow it to be hidden.\nDon\'t embed documents\nDon\'t allow the embedding of documents within documents.\nThis may well be a handy way to pass documents around, but it comes with problems.\nDocuments aren\'t directories. That you can put one or more documents into another doesn\'t mean that you should. Embedded documents can\'t be maintained as flexibly as documents in a directory.\nChanges to embedded documents aren\'t independently trackable.\nMany would see a change to an embedded document as not requiring a version increment, but then others would not know that the embedded document has been changed.\nComparing different versions of an embedded document, each in a different version of the containing document is, at the very least, a challenge.\nAnd, if you\'re in the habit of passing around links to a document, then there\'s no need to embed it.\nRemove older versions away.\nDon\'t keep older versions of a document (even the immediately previous version) in the same location as the current version. When someone lands in the directory or folder where the document is maintained, there should only be one version of the document available. This will make it completely clear as to which file should be accessed: there can be only one.\nIf you need to retain older versions, and if you aren\'t using a\nrevision control system that does this for you (see part 3), then\ncopy those older documents into a different directory. If that\ndifferent directory is to be a sub-directory of the document\'s\nnormal home, then it should be named such that it\'s clear that\nlive documents don\'t reside in there. (Call it\nObsolete Documents or something like that.)\nIn part 3 (of 2!), I finish going through my suggestions, and then will discuss one way of helping putting them into place.', 'Regardless of size, all businesses must be able to efficiently manage documents in order to be successful. In the past, that simply meant keeping documents organized in on-premise file cabinets. Access was restricted, and the use of off-premise documents required copies.\nSince the proliferation of computers and the internet, though, computerized document management systems have continued to gain in popularity. Not only can such systems handle scanned documents, but they also have the ability to process any document created on a computer, tablet or phone screen, including emails, drawings, photos, and electronic reports.\nDocument Management Systems Capabilities\nDocument management systems are able to store, send, retrieve and track documents in real-time. Modern systems are also able to track and organize various versions of the same document along with the date and time that those versions were created and by whom.\nThose features will help your organization to remain in compliance with governing regulations and industry standards by being able to quickly access policy statements, work instructions and procedures. The lack of such capabilities could result in penalties and loss of business in addition to the irreparable harm that could be done to your company’s reputation.\nTypical Document Management Pain Points\nAlthough significant strides have been made in document management systems over the past several years, many issues have remained unresolved until recently. Even with advances in cloud computing, the majority of businesses continue to store documents in a somewhat disorganized fashion, and employees waste an inordinate amount of time looking for the right document.\nOne reason that happens is because document management systems often spread the information across too many repositories, which results in document misplacement. In some cases, problems are related to a poor mobile experience, which forces employees to use email to process documents. However, most email security systems are inadequate to protect the privacy of sensitive information.\nAdvantages of Efficient Document Management Systems\nAn efficient document management system can be a real asset to several of your departments, including the likes of Finance and Human Resources. Your finance department needs to be able to access budgets, supplier contracts, cost analyses and tax records on an almost instantaneous basis in case of an audit or to prepare board reports.\nIn a similar fashion, your HR department must be able to manage all employee records while protecting their confidentiality. Such records often include position descriptions, applications, onboarding documents, pay scales, employee benefits, and contracts. For both of those departments, it is extremely important to be able to shield confidential information from outside influences as well as to restrict internal access.\nEssential Document Management System Features\nNot all document management systems are equal. Some essential document management systems provide features that others do not, such as GDPR compliance, workflow and project management. While not an exhaustive list, here is a description of six of those features:\n1. General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) Compliance\nDigital data and customer information is a commodity that deserves a high degree of protection. A document management system will help you comply with GDPR obligations by improving efficiency and streamlining access to information. You will have a direct line of sight into your data and be able to see who has access to it while restricting that access as much as possible. Additionally, you will be able to prove compliance and quickly recover from a disaster.\nA good document management system should contain an automated workflow system that sends documents to where they are needed. The distribution of documents should be governed by a set of rules that you can easily set up and modify as needed. It should allow both automatic and manual distribution, have customized windows, track routing and allow documents to be retained or permanently removed.\n3. Project Management\nDocument management systems should be incorporated into or interfaced with project management systems so that documents are immediately available to project management personnel. There should be no going back and forth from the document management system to the project management system. Rather, the two should work together in a seamless fashion so that they appear as one system to users.\n4. Mobile Compatibility\nIt has become commonplace for employees to rely on their tablets and smartphones instead of computers. A document management system with cloud capabilities will give your employees access to the information they need regardless of whether they are in the office, out in the field, on the factory floor, traveling on public transportation or in a customer’s office. They will be able to store, find, send and receive documents by using their smartphone as easily as they could by using a computer.\n5. Ease of Use\nNo matter how sophisticated a document management system is or how many features it provides, employees will not take advantage of its capabilities unless it is easy to use. If a system is too difficult to use, employees will find another way to get the job done. This often results in a waste of time and resources. An easy-to-use system will provide a pleasant interface and minimize the number of clicks required to access data.\n6. Version Tracking\nWhen your employees access a document, they need to make sure the document they are looking at is the most current version. In some cases, though, they may have a need to see an earlier version. Your document management system should be able to track the various versions of all documents. For current documents that have not been finalized, the system should record all document changes along with the person making the change and the date and time the change was made.\nIn the past, documents were stored on-premise in locked file cabinets. Remote access required that copies be made and distributed. Since the proliferation of computers and the internet, though, electronic document management systems began to appear. Although many of those systems were inefficient and did not relieve some of the more common pain points, some of the newer document management systems are very efficient and provide many desirable features, such as GDPR compliance, workflow and project management.\nSoftCo’s Enterprise Content Management (ECM) platform provides the user with the ability to manage and store large quantities of documents in a variety of formats. The system also offers workflow management capabilities, to automate a wide range of processes across a number of different departments within the organization.']"	['<urn:uuid:80bd2d99-e862-43ab-a201-2c4d9d10621a>', '<urn:uuid:479da8ef-e8d4-430f-a01e-6f63f642509d>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	9	56	2476
95	As a healthcare provider specializing in oncology, I often encounter families concerned about cancer risk and diagnosis - could you explain how genetic counselors assist in both cancer risk assessment and rare disease diagnosis, particularly regarding family history evaluation and emotional support?	Genetic counselors play multiple crucial roles in both cancer risk assessment and rare disease diagnosis. They collect and analyze detailed family medical history, including any instances of rare diseases or cancer patterns like having 3 or more relatives with the same cancer type or cancer diagnoses at early ages. They provide comprehensive information about genetic conditions and make specific recommendations for genetic testing based on symptoms and family history. Throughout the process, genetic counselors offer essential emotional support, helping families cope with the challenges of genetic testing and potential diagnoses. They prepare families for different possible outcomes, explain test results, and connect them with support groups. They also coordinate long-term care and treatment plans once a diagnosis is established. For cancer specifically, they help evaluate hereditary cancer risks and assist families in understanding how genetic test results may impact medical care decisions and risk reduction strategies.	['5 Things a Genetic Counselor Does for a Family\nThe 5 things a genetic counselor does for a family\nWhat is a genetic counselor?\nA genetic counselor is a medical professional, with extensive genetic expertise, who is able to support and help families facing a rare disease diagnosis. Genetic counselors provide a mixture of services and support, from emotional support, to medical knowledge, to recommendations for specific genetic tests.\nWhy genetic counseling?\nThere are many reasons why a family might be referred to a genetic counselor. Sometimes it may be because of a suspected rare disease in a family member, or it may be because a family member has been identified as high risk for developing a rare disease.\nAnyone undergoing genetic screening or testing, for any reason, should be referred to a genetic counselor both at the start of the process, and throughout it as well.\nThe 5 things a genetic counselor does for a family\nThe main roles of a genetic counselor are –\nProvides information about genetic diseases\nGenetic counselors are able to help families understand better about specific rare diseases, including what causes them, and their unique symptoms. The more information families have, and the better they understand specific rare diseases in terms of their own diagnosis, or potential diagnosis, the more empowered they are as patients or as the parents of a patient.\nWhile there is still much that is not understood about the genetic causes and presentation of many rare diseases, especially those with low prevalence rates, genetic counselors are able to enlighten families as much as they can as they begin to seek a rare disease diagnosis.\nCollects information from the family, in order to ensure a more accurate diagnosis\nIn order for rare disease patients to receive an accurate diagnosis, genetic counselors play an important role in collecting and understanding a patient’s family’s medical history, including any incidences of rare disease or symptoms that might suggest the occurrence of a rare disease.\nGenetic counselors will also explore, in-depth, any symptoms a patient may have, and understand how these may be related to a rare disease.\nThere is no one single genetic test to identify rare diseases, understanding which syndrome to test for, requires an intensive understanding of a patient’s family and personal medical history.\nOffers emotional support throughout the entire diagnosis process\nThe process of genetic diagnosis, screening and testing can be a difficult one for many families. Even if eventually a rare disease is ruled out, and even more so if at the end of the process a rare disease is diagnosed. The diagnosis process can be long, and challenging, and genetic counselors offer important support both medical, genetic and emotional along the way.\nGenetic counselors offer emotional support for families navigating genetic testing, and its results, and for those facing long term care of a family member with a rare disease. Deciding to undergo genetic testing is not an easy process, and genetic counselors play an important role in supporting families through it.\nThey will also help connect families to support groups and networks, allowing them to connect with other families with the same or similar diagnosis.\nMakes recommendations for genetic testing, and helps families understand the process of testing, and the results\nGenetic counselors play an important role in helping families decide which genetic testing to undergo, based on a patient’s symptoms and family history. They can also help families, who have received inconclusive or unclear testing results understand what is the next step for reaching a more conclusive diagnosis.\nGenetic counselors also help families understand the process of genetic testing, what it entails, and what the results might reveal. Preparing families for the different case scenarios following genetic testing is an important role of a genetic counselor.\nCoordinates treatment and long term care for a rare disease patient\nGenetic counselors help families, not only during the diagnosis process, but also once families have received a diagnosis as well. This help consists mainly of coordinating the different medical teams and professionals responsible for a rare disease patient’s care, both in the short and long term.\nHow do we improve access to genetic counselors?\nAccess to genetic counselors is crucial for all rare disease families, regardless of where they are in the diagnosis process, and regardless of whether their need for a genetic counselor involves a single meeting, or series of meetings.\nRecent developments in telehealth and telegenetics are allowing genetic counseling to move online. This means that families and genetic counselors are connecting more easily than ever before, and the potential to improve the accuracy of rare disease diagnosis is improving as the popularity of online genetic counseling grows. It also means families can connect to the different types of genetic counseling, including the various specialties.\nGenetic counselors can provide the assistance you and your family need in order to navigate and identify rare genetic syndromes including Lionitis syndrome and others.', 'Genetic testing helps estimate your chance of developing cancer in your lifetime. It does this by searching for specific changes in your genes, chromosomes, or proteins. These changes are called mutations.\nGenetic tests are available for some types of cancer. These include:\nGenetic testing may help:\nPredict your risk of a particular disease\nFind if you have genes that may pass increased cancer risk to your children\nProvide information to guide your health care\nNo genetic test can say if you will develop cancer for sure. But it can tell you if you have a higher risk than most people.\nOnly some people with a gene mutation will develop cancer. What does this mean? A woman may have a 45% to 65% chance of breast cancer. But she may never develop the disease. Meanwhile, a woman with a 25% chance may develop breast cancer.\nRisk factors for hereditary cancer\nA hereditary cancer is any cancer caused by an inherited gene mutation. An inherited gene means it is passed from parent to child within a family. The following factors suggest a possible increased risk for hereditary cancer:\nFamily history of cancer. Having 3 or more relatives on the same side of the family with the same or related forms of cancer.\nCancer at an early age. Having 2 or more relatives diagnosed with cancer at an early age. This factor may differ depending on the type of cancer.\nMultiple cancers. When one relative develops 2 or more types of cancer.\nRare cancers. Some types of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, adrenocortical cancer, or sarcoma, are linked to inherited genetic mutations.\nReasons to consider genetic testing for cancer\nGenetic testing is a personal decision made for different reasons. It is also a complex decision best made after talking with your family, health care team, and genetic counselor.\nASCO recommends considering genetic testing in the following situations:\nA personal or family history suggests a genetic cause of cancer.\nA test will clearly show a specific genetic change.\nThe results will help with diagnosis or management of a condition. For example, you may take steps to lower your risk. Steps may include surgery, medication, frequent screening, or lifestyle changes.\nASCO also recommends genetic counseling before and after genetic testing. Learn more about these recommendations on genetic testing for cancer susceptibility on a separate ASCO website.\nOther factors to consider\nGenetic testing has limitations and emotional implications. These may include:\nDepression, anxiety, or guilt. A positive test result means a gene mutation exists. This result may bring difficult emotions. Some people may think of themselves as sick, even if they never develop cancer. Negative test results may also cause difficult emotions. For example, some people may experience guilt if they do not have a gene mutation that other family members have.\nFamily tension. People are generally encouraged to tell family members about test results because they can be important for the health of family members. But this information could also complicate family dynamics. Learn more about sharing genetic test results with your family.\nA false sense of security. A negative result means a specific genetic mutation is not present. But people with negative results may still develop cancer. A negative result only means the person’s risk is average. Each person’s risk for cancer is also affected by other factors. For example, lifestyle, environmental exposure, and medical history.\nUnclear results. A gene may have a mutation not linked with cancer risk. This is called a variant of unknown significance. It means that it is unclear whether the mutation will increase risk. Or people may have mutations that current tests cannot find. Many cancers are not yet tied to specific gene mutations. Also, some genes may interact unpredictably with other genes or environmental factors. And these interactions may cause cancer. So it may be impossible to calculate the cancer risk.\nHigh cost. Genetic testing can be expensive. It is particularly expensive if health insurance does not pay for it.\nDiscrimination and privacy concerns. Some people fear genetic discrimination from test results. Others worry about the privacy of their genetic information. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) protects against employment and health insurance discrimination. Discuss related concerns with a genetic counselor or doctor.\nQuestions to ask yourself about genetic testing\nBefore having genetic testing, learn about its risks and limitations. Identify your reasons for wanting a test. And consider how you will cope with test results.\nHere are some questions to help you make a decision:\nDo I have a family history of cancer?\nHave I developed cancer at an earlier-than-average age?\nHow will I interpret the results of genetic testing? Who will help me use this information?\nWill the test results affect my medical care? The medical care of my family?\nIf I have a genetic condition, can I lower my cancer risk?\nA genetic counselor can help you answer these questions. He or she can give you advice and information about the risks and benefits of genetic testing. A genetic counselor also helps people through the genetic testing process. Learn more about what to expect when meeting with a genetic counselor.']	['<urn:uuid:802d5970-d1da-411d-907e-bf258a801ff8>', '<urn:uuid:1c356b00-d237-47b5-ad3a-558703f64326>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	42	146	1677
96	How should I water my lawn to prevent diseases during hot and cool weather?	Water in early morning when dew is still present, not during evening or night. Before hot weather, water ahead of the heat to keep soil moisture cooler in root zones. This helps prevent phytophthora fungal growth during heat and moisture conditions, and helps prevent various cool weather diseases that thrive in prolonged dampness.	"['#6: place tray in water drip tray. Gently sprinkle from top up and down in each variety row so seeds don\'t move out of their rows. Water will run through each cell, moistening all of the potting mix, and into the tray. Keep this water in the tray to be reabsorbed from the bottom of each cell as it\'s needed by the soil mix.\nYeah, well, 100 degrees isn’t fun in the garden, for people or plants.\nHopefully you kept track of the forecast, and watered before the temperature bolted. The trick is to get the moisture into the soil before the heat, not during the heat, just in case any phytophthora fungal organisms exist – they’ll go crazy when in both heat and moisture, and your plants may then be goners.\nWhen you water ahead of the heat, the soil moisture stays cooler in the root zones, so any existing phytophthora won\'t as readily affect your plants.\nThe first lettuce seeds germinated!\nThe first of the 24 varieties of lettuce seeds that I sowed last weekend are coming up – Bibb, Kagraner Sommer, and Tom Thumb. 21 varieties to go!\nSee the picture sequence at left for the seeding process, using my 30-year-old Speedling (R) trays that I purchased from Peaceful Valley Farm Supply (www.groworganic.com). The drip trays became available a couple of years ago, too. Yes, the set is relatively expensive with shipping, but mine are still serving me well after all these years! I use the 2"" cell size.\nIn the past, I’ve been careful to let only two or at most three seeds fall into each cell, so I could snip the less-vigorous ones when transplanting them. This time, since many of my seed packets were 2 years old, I was more generous to make sure I got good germination. The Bibb especially seems to have germinated all of the dozen-or-so seeds in each cell. When transplanting these, I’ll either snip all but two seedlings, or separate the seedlings into separate plants.\nThe reason to snip instead of pull extras out of the cell when allowing the remaining ones to develop further is so you don’t disturb the root of the couple you want to develop, which would set back the seedling a week or two.\nOther “Seedy” Notes\nAs some herbs reseed themselves, transplant them for overwintering in the garden. Dill, especially, seems to germinate better this way, so take advantage of it.\nProblems with seed germination may be due to old seed, soil that is too warm or has been allowed to dry out, or seeds that were sown either too deeply or not deeply enough.\nKeep seedbeds moist and shaded from hot afternoon sun until the seedlings develop two to four true leaves.\nWhen sowing cover crops for the fall and winter, consider edible ones. Kale and rocket (roquette, arugula) are full-flavored leafy vegetables that withstand freezing. Both germinate in cool weather and are welcome fresh greens for stir-fry and soups all winter long. In the spring, they can be easily turned under as ""green manure"" when preparing the soil for the main spring and summer crops.', 'Cool Weather Lawn Diseases\nof Spring and Fall\nLawn diseases can be very troubling and even the best lawns can be affected. Many diseases begin in the cool weather of spring and fall. Knowledge is the key to preventing disease. This page gives specific information on cool weather diseases, how and when they start, and how to treat them.\nDiseases are common with virtually all grass types. Although they are naturally occurring, how damaging they are can depend greatly on how we manage our lawns.\nWe know that lawns must be carefully maintained. However, if done improperly, we can actually predispose our grass to diseases. Proper cultural practices that hinder disease development is your first line of defense against lawn diseases.\nMicroscopic living organisms are the cause of lawn diseases. They include bacteria, fungi, nematodes, phytoplasmas, and a few other organisms. However, pathogenic fungi are the cause of most lawn diseases. These fungi can remain dormant in the soil until environmental conditions favor an outbreak. Lawn Diseases can also be distributed by wind, splashing rain, foot traffic, equipment, etc. Since these fungi lack roots, stems, or chlorophyll, they get their nutrients from their host.\nPathogenic fungi penetrate the host plant when conditions favor the disease. An important note in diagnosing diseases is that an infected plant will display specific symptoms and damage characteristic of that particular pathogen.\nThree conditions must be met before lawn diseases can begin.\n- There must be a pathogen present in and around your soil.\n- Your grass type must be susceptible to that specific pathogen.\n- The environmental conditions must be right for the disease to develop.\nThe most important of these is the environmental conditions. It is an almost certainty that pathogens are constantly present in your soil. However, it is a necessity for the environmental conditions to be correct before anything will happen. Your best defense against lawn diseases is to perform cultural practices that discourage them. Read the section on\nMaintaining your lawn to Discourage Disease\nBelow are specific disease profiles of common cool weather diseases.\nHelminthosporium Leaf Spot and Melting Out Disease\nLeaf spot is a disease that appears during cool, drizzly, moist spring weather. Heavy, wet dews, high humidity on overcast days, watering at night, and frequent rain will encourage disease growth.\nThe disease over-winters in thatch, soil, or in lesions of infected grass. Just as soon as environmental conditions are right, the disease will appear.\nIn cool season grasses, helminthosporium leaf spot is a problem for all grasses. Tall fescue, Kentucky bluegrass, and ryegrass are most affected.\nIn warm season grasses, bermudagrass is most affected, although all warm season grasses are able to get the disease. Different species of the fungus will attack different types of grasses.\nThe disease has two stages. The first stage is the “leaf spot” stage. Small, purple spots appear on the grass blade. The spots vary in size from 1/32 to ¼ inch depending on the grass type affected. As the spots expand, the center of the spot becomes tan, but the outside edges will remain purple. The larger spots take on an hour glass appearance.\nThe second stage is the “melting out” stage. It occurs when the environmental conditions that favor the disease persist and the disease spreads to the grass crown. When that happens, the disease enters the melting out phase and the grass dies.\nThe leaf spot stage is less serious of the two. If while in the leaf spot stage, the environmental conditions change becoming drier, the disease will usually stop and the grass will grow out of it. If conditions remain the same, the grass will turn yellow to orange and die from the tip down.\nCultural Practices that Discourage Disease\nDo not over-fertilizer the grass. Be especially careful in early spring if you have had problems before. Succulent grass will only feed the disease making it worse. For cool season grass, use slow release nitrogen in the spring while keeping the amount per 1000/sq.ft. on the lean side. Do not starve the grass, however, but follow a balanced fertility program.\nFor warm season grass, do not fertilize before the grass breaks dormancy. It is best to wait until the temperatures warm significantly before the first application goes down. Do not fertilize in the fall since the disease can return in the cooler weather.\nMoisture is very important to the onset of the disease. Try not to irrigate unless the grass needs it. Also, do not irrigate in the evening or at night. Rather, water in the early morning when the dew is still on the grass. If you water after the dew has dried in late morning, it only extends the amount of time the grass and soil is wet.\nIf you have experienced disease problems before, removing heavy dew is important before disease symptoms appear. Use the hose or sprinkler to wash off the dew. Just a quick blast of water will do it. This washes off the guttation fluid (sugar secreted onto the grass surface) as well. This sugar is a food source for leaf spot and many other pathogenic fungi.\nDragging a hose over the grass is also effective in removing dew. Golf courses have practiced this for many years.\nHerbicide Use During Disease Activity\nAvoid the over use of herbicides during disease activity. If you need to spray for weeds, spot spray only. Dicamba, 2,4-D and other herbicides have been known to encourage leaf spot and other lawn diseases.\nFungicides are not needed if the disease doesn’t progress past the leaf spot stage.\nIf you believe that fungicides are warranted, they must be applied as soon as symptoms are observed. Once the disease reaches the crown, it grass affected will die.\nProducts such as Heritage, Compass, Disarm and Insignia are labeled for use on lawns. Be aware that fungicides containing “Chlorothalonil” is no longer labeled for lawn use at the time of this writing.\nRead the product label carefully and completely before use. Fungicides can be difficult to apply correctly and safely. Timing of the application is important. If you are uncertain about how to apply it after reading the label, check with the county extension office for further help. You may want to hire a licensed professional with experience in lawn diseases to apply the chemical for you.\nSpring Dead Spot\nSpring Dead spot is one of the most damaging disease of bermudagrass. There are a number of fungi that may cause the disease, but in the U.S. it is Leptosphaeria Korrae and Ophiospharella herpotricha. The disease generally attacks mature bermudagrass lawns that have been established for over three years.\nHealthy vigorous turfgrass better resist diseases than unhealthy grass. The most susceptible grasses are those that are stressed and weakened from growing in poor soil, has been poorly maintained, or when growing outside it climate zone.\nHow the Disease Operates\nThis lawn disease actually begins in the fall, but the evidence of the disease doesn’t appear until spring. In the fall, when the soil cools to 80 degrees, the disease becomes active and infects the roots. The disease in not noticed because the grass will soon start to go dormant. When spring approaches, the disease progression speeds up. The roots are not able to take up nutrients or break dormancy and the grass quickly dies.\nThe disease is noticed in spring as the grass is breaking dormancy and greening up. You will notice patches of grass that look sunken and have a dead, whitish look. (A different look from healthy dormant grass.)\nThe patches of dead grass are circular ranging from 6 inches to 3 feet in diameter. They will often coalesce leaving larger, more irregular shaped patches. The patches are dead and cannot be saved.\nEventually the grass will spread into the damaged area, but it will continue to have problems.\nCultural Practices that Discourage Disease Development\nIf you have had problems with the disease before, it is important to maintain potash (K) levels in the soil. (K) or Potash is also referred to a Potassium, represented by the third number on a fertilizer bag. Even small deficiencies in K lowers the grass’ resistance to the disease. Even if a soil test shows the level to be adequate, you still need to apply 1 lb of potash per 1000/sq.ft. to soil. However, not more than a pound per 1000/sq.ft. should be applied at one time. You can purchase fertilizer that contains only Potassium. It will look something like 0-0-15. The last number will depend on the percentage of K in the bag.\nMaintain the soil pH at 5 to 5.5. No one knows exactly why this helps, but it does. Either the grass’ resistance is raised or microorganisms that are antagonistic to spring dead spots are more active at that pH range.\nRaise the mower blade. Higher mowing heights means deeper roots and more blade for carbohydrate production. It may provide enough resistance if disease pressure is low.\nKeep thatch to acceptable levels of ½ inch. Use a dethatching machine if you have severe thatch problems. Annual core aeration works well to keep thatch levels within a desirable range.\nThis is one of the times when applications of ammonium sulfate fertilizers to help speed recovery of damaged areas. Make sure you water the fertilizer in directly after application to avoid burning the grass. Studies have shown that the grass responds better with ammonium sulfate than when using urea based nitrogen. In addition, the ammonical fertilizers do not remain in the root zone for as long as coated urea products. This is important because you want the nitrogen to be used up when fall approaches and the disease becomes active again.\nDo not use fertilizer containing ammonium nitrate, however. Ammonium nitrate is not the same thing as ammonium sulfate and will will not give you the desired results.\nSeveral fungicides are labeled for spring dead spot. However, university tests have shown that fungicides are not always successful in controlling this disease. Some products displayed no noticeable results at all. For other, results were inconsistent at best. If you do use a fungicide, it must be applied in September or when temperatures dip below 80 degrees. It must be applied as the disease activity begins.\nFollow label directions completely. If you are not having good results or having difficulty applying the product, remember that commercial applicators have access to fungicides and equipment that are not always available to homeowners.\nRed Thread and Pink Patch Diseases\nRed thread and pink patch are lawn diseases that often occur together. A variety of grass types are affected including Kentucky bluegrass, fine fescue, ryegrass and bentgrass. The fine fescues and ryegrass may be the most severely affected.\nThis lawn disease is one of the easiest to identify. The late stages of red thread lawn disease produces a network of bright pink to reddish color fungus with a thread-like appearance. On cool, damp mornings, the lawn fungus covers the grass with a pink, gelatin like mycelium. Pink patch develops a gelatinous, pink fungus on the grass.\nThe lawn disease attacks grass that is low in nitrogen. Their development favors cool, wet spring and fall weather. you will often see them during extended periods of damp, drizzly, overcast conditions. This disease has also been known to appear as snow is melting in winter. Mild winters will generally see more occurrences of the disease than harsh winters.\nThe disease over-winters in in thatch and organic lawn debris. The following spring as temperatures reach 65 degrees the disease becomes active. Moisture is important for the disease to spread. Prolonged dampness from rain, dew, or irrigating in the evening or at night accelerates the disease activity.\nOnce the disease starts, it can be easily spread by mowing. Collecting the grass clippings and disposing of them may slow the disease. Animals or people walking across the lawn can pick up and deposit the lawn fungus in other areas.\nCultural Practices that Discourage Disease Growth\nBe sure to maintain proper nitrogen levels in the turf. The disease doesn’t usually attack healthy grass. Lawns that are low in nitrogen will be the most severely affected.\nDon’t over-fertilize or you will predispose your grass to other lawn diseases, such as leaf spot.\nRed thread usually isn’t a serious lawn disease and fungicide use isn’t recommended. If you properly maintain your lawn with sufficient nitrogen you will have few problems.\nClick on the\nfor help in developing a fertility program.\nPowdery mildew isn’t usually a serious lawn disease. It looks a little worse than it actually is. The grass will look as if someone dusted it with a white powder. If you touch the blade, the powder will easily brush off.\nIt is primarily a lawn disease that grows in light to heavy shade. The most commonly affected is Kentucky Bluegrass, but fescue can also get the disease. The disease occurs when temperatures average 60 to 70 degrees during the cool, humid weather in spring or fall.\nPowdery mildew lawn fungus will not invade the crown or roots, but remains on the blade surface. However, the fungus produces structures that will pierce the grass’ outer leaf layer to draw nutrients. It does not attack as aggressively as other diseases. The biggest problem may be that the heavy coating of white powdery mycelium blocks the sunlight and prevents photosynthesis from taking place. If the powder remains, the leaves will turn yellow and could die back.\nConditions that Promote The Disease\nThis lawn disease grows in the shade during cool, humid spring weather. It doesn’t need heavy dew conditions to germinate like other lawn diseases. It is most severe under shade trees or on the shady side of homes. Trees with a dense canopy and low hanging branches are prime candidates for powdery mildew due to reduced air circulation. The low hanging branches trap air and humidity, thus providing the right environment for disease activity.\nWhile the lawn disease is active, fertilization and excessive water may help accelerate the disease. The spores are spread to uninfected grass while mowing or from the splashing of water from rain or sprinklers.\nCommon varieties of Kentucky bluegrass are not considered to be shade tolerant. As the leaves fill the trees in spring, the grass weakens. In this weakened condition, the grass offers little resistance to disease growth.\nPrune low hanging limbs as well as limbs in the canopy to allow in more light and better air circulation. On shady sides of homes, over-seed the area with shade tolerant and powdery mildew resistant varieties. Shade tolerant varieties of Kentucky bluegrass include America, Bensun, Exlipse, and Glade. With these grasses you get two things in one: shade tolerance and disease resistance.\nIf problems continue, it may be necessary to remove the grass and put down mulch. Depending on the amount of shade, you can always experiment with shade garden plants instead of grass.\nUse fungicides as a last alternative. Some fungicides can be expensive, so you will have to compare the cost with the unsightliness of the disease. Contact fungicides are protective (preventative) and need to be applied before the lawn disease begins for best results. Fungicides applied after the disease has begun may have little or no effect. Examples of fungicides for powdery mildew are Clearys 3336F or Fungo Flo 4.5F Carefully follow all directions on the label. Other fungicides are also available.\nHot Weather Lawn Diseases\nThe dog days of summer can also being some of the most damaging disease. Click here for common summer lawn disease profiles, including how they start, recognizing disease symptoms as well as treatment options.\nCultural Practices that Discourage Diseases\nAre your maintenance practices weakening your grass? Stressed and weakened grass is more susceptible to disease. Using proven methods to care for your lawn is far more beneficial than you think.\nUnderstanding Lawn Fungicides\nNever used a fungicide? While cultural practices are the best way to prevent diseases, you may someday find it necessary to use a fungicide. Knowing what they are and how they work is important for successful disease control.\nUsing Herbicides Safely\nYour safety, the safety of your family and the environment should be your greatest concerns when using lawn chemicals.

97	What happens when eco-industries lobby for environmental policies?	Eco-industries generally lobby in favor of stricter environmental policies because this increases their business. However, there is one exception - they may oppose stricter policies if the negative impact from foreign competition outweighs the potential increase in turnover that would come from tighter environmental regulations.	['International Environmental Policies and Environmental Lobbying in the Presence of Eco-industry\nAbstractThis paper analyses the political economy of environmental policies in the presence of an eco-industry pressure group. Previous studies have dealt with two types of lobbies: capitalists and environmentalists. We introduce a third pressure group representing the eco-industry sector. Under this type of economy, the incumbent government maximizes its chances of being re-elected. Its objective functions include social welfare as well as political contributions. The introduction of the eco-industry lobby introduces a new political contribution and modifies the incentives of the traditional lobbies. Furthermore, we underline the conditions under which environmentalists and eco-industries can become political allies. We also explain that, considering the overall profit of a vertical structure, an industrial lobby group can be favourable to a more stringent environmental policy. Next, we assume an open economy. In two countries, two polluting sectors are subject to an environmental policy. Therefore, an eco-industry sector which supplies pollution abatement goods and services arises. Abatement goods and services are assumed to be internationally traded, creating the only industrial interaction between both countries. The pollution, which can be transboundary or purely local, affects consumers in both countries; we analyse both cases. Our main findings can be summarized as follows. First, eco-industries lobby in favour of more stringent environmental policies, except if the impact of foreign competition more than compensates the turnover increase induced by a tighter environmental policy. Polluting firms always lobby against tighter environmental policies. However, an industrial pressure group, representing the industry as a whole and considering upstream and downstream profits, can sometimes be favourable to an increase in the environmental policy, as it leads to increased profits. We also show that an environmental pressure group can ask for a decrease in the environmental policy at home to decrease pollution abroad. This result does not rely on interactions between countries within the polluting sector. Interaction within the eco-industry sector is a sufficient condition for demonstrating that environmentalists can be favourable to a decrease in the local environmental policy. The impact of lobbying activities on the politically optimal environmental policy is ambiguous and depends on the relative concentration of each pressure group.

She carried archers who could fire up to 12 arrows per minute using powerful longbows requiring up to 200lbs (90kg) of pull strength. For artillery, she carried 40-pounder long guns on her main gun deck (larger than those on HMS Victory in 1805), plus various smaller guns in fore and aft castles. She was among the first ships to feature broadside batteries, marking a significant evolution in naval warfare.

Highly Recommended.\nThe story of the Mary Rose may seem sad, or tragic, but as a warship she enjoyed a relatively long life and, when she sank, she was to become the only restored example of a key development in the history of the sailing warship. She set off from Portsmouth under the eyes of King Henry VIII to take on a French fleet that was offshore. As she turned on leaving harbour, she started to take on water and rapidly sank, with heavy loss of life. There have been several theories as to why she sank as she did, but much information has emerged during her careful restoration.\nSinking on her side, the Mary Rose sank into the mud and clay so that an almost complete elevation was buried. Over the centuries that followed, the exposed timbers rotted but what was buried survived remarkably well. The decision to raise and preserve the remains was a brave one and there was no certainty that the process would be successful, or that anything significant could be preserved. There was simply no comparable experience to give any assurance.\nA special lifting frame was constructed, taken out to the wreck site and fitted around the remains. The lift barge then began the painstaking process of slowly bringing the remains to the surface and then to the restoration shed in Portsmouth’s historic naval shipyards. It was a memorable sight for anyone fortunate to watch the process – one of those great memories that lasts for ever, in every detail.\nOne of the early tasks was in removing remaining mud and sifting it for artefacts. It was only then that the restoration team realized how much unique and priceless items were contained in what was left of the hull.\nMary Rose is now part of a fascinating museum in a new building. It is one of those maritime museums that must be visited.\nThis new Conway book provides a detailed view into a key piece of naval technology. It does this in a unique way with drawings and photographs that are each of the highest quality and finest detail. This tells a story that can only be told in this way and the publisher has done an outstanding job of production, at an amazingly low cover price.\nWhat makes the Mary Rose such an important find and restoration is that not only is there an almost complete elevation, but the team restoring the remains have been able to extract so much additional detail with an amazing collection of fittings and personal equipment, together even with a skeleton ship’s dog. The work that has gone into the archaeology is unparalleled and this is covered very well in the book.\nWhat makes the Mary Rose such an important ship is not just that she is the only vessel of her type to be restored to provide such a detailed collection of knowledge. The Mary Rose was one of a small number of vessels that marked a significant change in naval technology. She carried her guns mainly in broadside batteries and that allowed her and her fleet to sail in line as the first line-battle-ships. She was the Dreadnought of her age, changing naval warfare for ever.\nBefore the Mary Rose and a handful of similar ships, England had maintained very few vessels designed specifically and exclusively for war. King Arthur did build a relatively small navy of longships to defend against Norse attacks, but they do not appear to have been consistently maintained as a naval force, rather they were built, enjoyed a short life and periods passed when few if any were serviceable. The differences between fighting longships and their commercial knar sisters were not great. They were open boats equipped with a single square sail but were normally fought under oar power. As commercial craft developed and became larger, there is no evidence that warships were specifically built for the purpose. It seems that Kings impressed commercial vessels into naval service and carried out modifications that were later removed if the vessel returned to commercial use. The primary modification was to add a castle at stern and bow to provide fighting platforms for archers and spear-men. In some cases, the lookout platform high in the main mast may have been enlarged for archers. As guns became a more common weapon, these were added to impressed merchant craft but were issued in small numbers and mainly sledge mounted. The common round in use was stone balls. The Mary Rose also used stone ball ammunition but her guns were capable of firing iron shot.\nHenry VIII was a keen developer of naval and land power. He commissioned castles, designed specifically for guns, and watched the Mary Rose sink from his vantage point at Southsea Castle which was, and is, a fine example of the Tudor gun fort. He also went to considerable effort to acquire modern guns, both artillery and personal firearms. As with the construction of castles designed to mount guns, he encouraged the building of ships to carry guns. The Mary Rose did include a large number of bows with a large supply of arrows, but she also carried personal firearms. What is notable is the extent of her gun armament and the size of the largest pieces.\nThe Mary Rose was a Great Castle ship. She introduced the broadside as a method of engagement, although she carried a number of smaller guns in the fore and aft castles, including guns that could fire down into the waist of the ship against boarders or mutineers. Most interestingly, she carried 40 pounder long guns on her main gun deck, larger than those carried in 1805 by HMS Victory. Tudor heavy naval guns had a greater range than those of Nelson’s day. What is not entirely clear is why the Tudor warships carried such a range of firearms. Some have speculated that this demonstrates an exciting period in the development of the gun where many different sizes and forms were experimented with. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the variation was a matter of supply rather than preference of or experiment. There is certainly evidence that Henry VIII pursued a number of sources of supply in an attempt to acquire the numbers of guns he required.\nEven in 1805, a major warship would carry a number of sizes of gun, with the lowest gun deck carrying the largest guns that were all of one type and size. The next gun deck carried smaller guns and the third gun-deck the smallest long guns, but with the heaviest guns being short range cannonades, or smashers, on the same deck. Swivel guns were carried on the upper deck and in the fighting tops, being used also on the larger ships boats. Against the mixed armament of 1805 on major warships, perhaps the Tudor use of a number of different types of gun is not remarkable. However, the 1805 RN warship did have a standard gun format of cast iron canon, mounted on four wheel trucks, and a small number of short barrel heavy guns on slide mounts. In shape and construction, the 32 pounder, 24 pounder and 12 pounder guns where the same, differing only in size, and using the same design of four wheel truck mount. The Mary Rose demonstrates a variety of mounts, including four wheel wooden trucks, sledge mounts and swivels. The muzzle loading cast gun was in common use, but the forged gun was equally common and, although forged guns were prone to the forging breaking down, with a short in service life, it has been argued that they were cheaper and quicker to produce, offered improved performance initially, and also offered a higher rate of fire because they were supplied with three chambers that were charged and breech loaded one after the other. Where the forged canon started out on a wooden sledge, the Mary Rose demonstrates the next development where two wheels were mounted to the front of the carriage but a heavy elevating quadrant was the third point of contact with the deck. This arrangement would have improved the control for gun laying. As long as the gun was breech loaded, it would not have required running fully out after reloading, but recoil on firing would have driven the gun inboard and running it fully out to fire again would have required more effort than for a four wheel truck mount.\nThe armament and other items of equipment have been as carefully illustrated as the ship and its component parts. As the Mary Rose is not a complete elevation, the drawings of the hull have included an estimate of the forecastle, most of which had rotted away. As with other books in the series, the flaps of the cover fold out to reveal full hull drawings. In all, there are more than 200 drawings and plans, together with more than 40 reference photographs. Although the original readership for the series was expected to be model makers and serious naval history enthusiasts, this book and other books in the series provide a level of artwork to attract a much wider readership and the story of the Mary Rose and her restoration will appeal to many interests.']"	['<urn:uuid:2817384a-c45d-430e-bd3d-15632d4fd8cb>', '<urn:uuid:7ed16747-603b-464c-aba0-eabe436adca6>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	6	79	2573
99	What is a smokehouse breakpoint and how does it form?	A smokehouse breakpoint is the location where two opposing airstreams collide in an industrial smokehouse. It forms when alternating dampers create two different airflows - a high velocity airflow and a low velocity airflow. The high velocity airflow travels down the oven wall and across the floor, while the low velocity airflow travels a shorter distance. When these airflows collide, they create the breakpoint, which has enough velocity to penetrate through the product and cook it.	['Smokehouse Breakpoint. If you work with industrial smokehouses, or are in the market for one, you’re likely familiar with the term. It is the most important factor in your smokehouse, after all.\nBut what exactly is the smokehouse breakpoint? How does it form? Why is it so important? How does it affect your product?\nEven those in the business of cooking and drying product, or purchasing smokehouses for their company, have trouble answering those questions.\nIf the breakpoint really is the most important factor in your smokehouse (and you’ll see below, it really is!), then it’s imperative to understand what exactly the breakpoint it and how it affects your product.\nThe Ultimate Smokehouse Breakpoint Guide\nIn order to help you better understand the smokehouse breakpoint and how it affects your product, we put together this easy to understand guide complete with explanations and pictures that move away from the technical jargon.\nThe Breakpoint Guide is quite lengthy, but you can skip to the section you want by clicking the links below.\n- What is the Breakpoint\n- Forming the breakpoint\n- Movement of the Breakpoint\n- How the Breakpoint Cooks Product\n- Rack Design & Breakpoint\n- How the Breakpoint Affects Product Consistency\n- Controlling the Breakpoint\nWhat is the Smokehouse Breakpoint?\nBack in the late 1950’s, an innovative new way of cooking product in the meat processing industry was discovered — an innovation that is still in use in industrial smokehouses and dehydrators today.\nThis innovation incorporated the use of alternating dampers in forced-air ovens so air from a single fan could be delivered to product on racks.\nThe alternating dampers on either side of the oven create two opposing airstreams in the oven cabinet. The location where these opposing airstreams collide is called the breakpoint.\nForming the Smokehouse Breakpoint\nThe breakpoint is formed by a combination of the fan, alternating dampers, and the corresponding high and low velocity airflows created in the oven.\nAirflow created by the fan enters the supply duct and hits the alternating dampers. The damper that is set to block the duct creates the low velocity airflow while the damper set to open creates the high velocity airflow. These differing airflows are on opposing sides of the oven, as seen in the image below.\nThe high velocity airflow travels down the oven wall, across the floor, and up the opposing side. The low velocity airflow travels a much shorter distance, hence being low velocity.\nThe collision of the low velocity airflow and the high velocity airflow causes the air to break towards the center of the oven — forming the breakpoint.\nWhen formed correctly, the breakpoint has enough velocity to penetrate through the product on your rack before the air is drawn back to the return duct. It’s this breakpoint air that ultimately cooks your product.\nMovement of the Smokehouse Breakpoint\nAn efficient smokehouse or dehydrator doesn’t rely on just one or two breakpoints to cook the product. Doing so creates cold spots within the oven (areas where product is not getting enough of the breakpoint air to cook correctly) and results in product inconsistencies — both in yields and coloring.\nThe ability to move the breakpoint to various zones allows for more uniform cooking.\nThe breakpoint needs to be positioned at the height of the product, not too high, which bypasses the product envelope, and not too low that it is not directing airflow to the upper corners of the product envelope.\nAdjusting the angle of the dampers allows more or less airflow into the oven cabinet. As the dampers adjust, the velocity of the air released changes — either increasing or decreasing the high velocity airflow to go further or less in the oven. When the airflows change velocity, the point where they collide (the breakpoint) changes locations in the oven.\nThe speed at which the breakpoint moves is dependent upon the damper shaft’s revolution per minute.\nIn order to get good heat transfer and enough exposure to the oscillating airflow for even drying of product, the RPM of the supply airflow dampers should run between 0.25 and 0.5 RPM, or its equivalency if the dampers move back and forth from 0 degrees to 90 degrees.\nHow the Breakpoint Cooks Product\nAs already mentioned, it is the air in the breakpoint that actually cooks your product.\nThe velocity of the breakpoint air as it moves across product on the rack essentially wipes away a layer of cold air surrounding the product and replaces it with hot air. The hot air left behind is eventually transferred to the product, cooking it to the required temperature.\nRack Design and Breakpoint\nThe design of the rack used in the smokehouse can greatly affect airflow in the oven, and hinder the formation of the breakpoint.\nAs mentioned above, the high velocity airflow travels down the wall of the oven and across the floor to meet the low velocity airflow. In other words, it must travel under the rack in the oven.\nAny obstructions in the path of the high velocity airflow can slow down or stop the airflow.\nA smokehouse rack designed with a low clearance (image 1 below) will cause an airflow obstruction in the oven. This low design essentially creates a “wall” on the floor of the oven, breaking the high velocity airflow and affecting where the breakpoint occurs.\nIn order to keep the high velocity airflow from being obstructed, the rack should have minimal obstructions up to 12 inches from the floor (image 2 below).\nHow the Breakpoint Affects Product Consistency\nThe breakpoint plays a critical role in the consistency of your product and is often to blame for poor product yields (or the remaining weight of your product after cooking).\nMost smokehouses offer only a handful of breakpoint locations in the oven — meaning product closest to those breakpoints get cooked faster and more thoroughly, while product furthest from the breakpoints cooks slower.\nThe varying rates of cooking caused by fewer breakpoints in the oven leads to higher yield gaps: where some product on your rack is over cooked and other product is cooked just right.\nAs you have likely experience, this results in inconsistent product yields and coloring. The product closest to the breakpoint often can be burnt, darker, and in some cases, needs to be thrown out, while product furthest from the breakpoint achieves the color desired.\nImagine the difference in your product if there were more breakpoints in the oven! Rather than needing to overcook the product closes to the breakpoint so that product furthest from the breakpoint can be cooked, there would be more breakpoints — meaning less product would be away from the breakpoint.\nWhen there are more breakpoints in the oven, you eliminate those cold spots and your product cooks more consistently.\nControlling the Breakpoint\nWhen you understand the smokehouse breakpoint and how it cooks your product, it leads to one conclusion: controlling the breakpoint (i.e. – directing the airflows to break in certain zones in the oven) gives you ultimate control over your product.\nFusion Tech’s Total Flow Control system allows you to control the breakpoint in your smokehouse or dehydrator automatically — based on the internal temperature variance of your product — throughout the entire cooking process. Total Flow Control also allows you to pre-program the breakpoint by having complete control over your supply dampers, eliminating the temperature variances found in smokehouses.']	['<urn:uuid:b09874f9-6387-462a-9a3a-9970cc05d649>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T03:08:11.324803	10	76	1238
100	difference maintenance requirements sustainable drainage systems	Green roofs and rain gardens have contrasting maintenance needs. Green roofs vary in maintenance requirements based on their type - extensive roofs incorporate low maintenance planting that is wind, drought and frost resilient, while intensive roofs require more maintenance than traditional roofs due to their complex landscape strategy. Rain gardens, however, are specifically described as low maintenance solutions, using hardy native plants that require little to no watering and are perennial, returning every year with minimal upkeep. The plants chosen for rain gardens are both water-tolerant and drought-tolerant, making them particularly easy to maintain.	['When most people think of drainage they think of pipes in the ground, however, today we are looking at a drainage system that can be installed on your roof.\nWelcome to our next instalment of our deep dive into the world of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) where this week we are heading to the top of your development and looking at how green roofs can be used as part of your drainage system.\nSo what is a green roof?\nA green roof is simply a roof that has been partially or fully covered by vegetation and is sometime also referred to as a living roof. They sit right at the top of the hierarchy meaning that they not only provide attenuation from a drainage point of view but also improve water quality, promote biodiversity and provide opportunities to create amenity spaces.\nThere are predominantly two types of systems and which one you go for really depends on your project and access requirements. They can either be:\n- Extensive Roofs – These are specified when access to the roof is not important. They are relatively lightweight as a result of low substrate depths and generally incorporate low maintenance planting which is fairly wind, drought and frost resilient.\n- Intensive Roofs – Also known as roof gardens these can be used where there is a requirement for the roof to be used as a recreational space. They have a much deeper growing medium which can accommodate a more complex landscape strategy however, as a result they do usually require more maintenance than a traditional roof.\nFigure 1: Example of Extensive (Left) and Intensive (Right) green roofs\nSource: CIRIA SuDS Manual Version 6 (C753)\nWhere can they be used?\nBasically, if your development has a roof there is an opportunity to make it green. It does not matter if your project is large or small, residential or commercial a green roof can provide the opportunity of bringing a range of benefits to your project.\nSome of my favourite applications of green roofs are in the educational sector where intensive roofs can be used to create outdoor learning areas and provide opportunities to reconnect children with nature.\nA brilliant example of this is the installation of a green roof by Sheffield City Council at Sharrow Primary School. The project involved the design and construction of a new 2000m2 green roof which created play space as well as outdoor classrooms. It was also the first green roof in the country to be declared a nature reserve. Further information on the project can be found at the link below.\nFigure 2: Green roof at Sharrow Primary School, Sheffield\nSo what are the benefits in terms of drainage?\nGreen roofs help to mimic the natural runoff profile by allowing some of the rainfall to be taken up by the vegetation or through evaporation meaning that less of it needs to be accommodated in your below ground drainage system.\nData released by Baulder who are a green roof specialist state that extensive roofs with a 20-40mm of substrate can retain 40% of average rainfall while for intensive roofs with 500mm of substrate has the capability of storing up to 90% of the average rainfall.\nThis means that attenuation features on the ground can be smaller requiring less excavation and leaving more space for other services.\nAre there any other advantages?\nThere are many advantages of using green roofs on your development, with some of the main ones being:\n- No additional land take as the attenuation requirement is being provided through what would traditionally be an underutilised asset.\n- Improvement of air quality as the vegetation can help to filter out both dust particles and gas pollutants.\n- Can insulate the building against extremes in temperatures leading to a reduction in heating costs in the winter and cooling costs in the summer.\n- Can be used to absorb sound so could be particularly beneficial adjacent to airports, motorways, etc.\nThis all sounds too good to be true? What are the downsides?\n- Green roofs generally cost more than conventional roofs due to the increased structural requirements, this can be offset however by some of the additional benefits they can provide.\n- For intensive roofs there can be an increased requirement for maintenance.\n- As the roof is designed to store water it means that any damage to the membrane could be more critical.\nGreen roofs are a fantastic way of utilising what would be dead space to help meet your attenuation requirements. They can bring a raft of benefits to your project and enhance your outdoor space creating opportunities for people to interact more with nature.\nIf you want to know more why not check out some of the links included within this article or get in touch where we will be happy to advise on how a green roof might benefit your project.', 'What Is a Rain Garden and How Does it Work?\nRain gardens are shallow depressions filled with loose, deep soil to allow for the natural filtration of stormwater. They are planted with low maintenance native plants that attract pollinators. By adding rain gardens to your landscaping you can significantly reduce the risk of flooding on your property while preventing water pollution and supporting the biodiversity of our Toronto neighborhoods.\nBy putting in that rain garden, you are basically putting in a living sponge around your home and building a little line of defense that again really helps to offset the stormwater that flows in the lake with a great force.\n– Marc Yamaguchi, Rain Gardens United\nCheck out this video by Rain Gardens United about making Toronto rain garden friendly:\nThe Many Benefits of Building a Rain Garden\nSignificant Reduction of The Potential of Flooding in Your Home\nAside from making your property more attractive, a rain garden is also a practical preventative measure that can greatly benefit your home. The garden greatly reduced the potential of flooding, drainage problems, and stream bank erosions by acting as a barrier between rainwater and your home.\nPreserves the Natural Water Cycle and Protects Local Rivers, Lakes, Fish and Drinking Water Sources\nCanada has 7% of the world’s renewable fresh water.\nAside from benefiting your own property, these gardens are ecologically friendly and help build resiliency for cities by combating the effects of climate change. The filtration process helps the natural water cycle as well. By limiting the amount of water that enters the local storm drain system, the garden reduces the number of pollutants from yards and roads that run into waterways.\nCreates a Diverse and Healthy Ecosystem\nImproving the health of bees and other pollinators is a necessity. Without pollinators, much of the food we eat and the natural habitats we enjoy would not exist.\nNative plants attract pollinators which helps regulate the ecosystem by maintaining a diversity of plants and can help improve the health of Toronto’s pollinators by making your outdoor space pollinator-friendly.\nLow Maintenance solution\nRain gardens are planted with beautiful and hardy plants which don’t require a lot of upkeep because they require little to no watering which results in a low maintenance garden that looks beautiful. Native plants are perennials that will return every year, making your landscaping look more luscious as time passes.\nhow to Build a Rain Garden\nStep i: Dig a depression.\nMake sure to call Ontario One Call before you dig! Once your locates are marked, and you’ve decided on the location, the size and the style of your new garden, it’s time to start digging! Ideally, rain gardens should be dug to a depth of approximately 85cm or deeper if you want a smaller garden.\nStep ii: create a soakaway & connect the downspout\nA soakaway area balances your garden and is a key to the effectiveness of your garden. A soakaway pit is a hole in the ground filled with a permeable material like gravel to allow for water to percolate through into the soil.\nFirst, we add a layer of ¾ crushed stone wrapped in filter cloth landscaping fabric. Then we top this with an absorbent soil mix which usually contains a combination of compost and sand. This mix is designed to allow water to infiltrate the garden easily and quickly.\nStep iii: add plants & river rock\nThis is the fun part! There is a range of native plants to choose from that are both water-tolerant and drought-tolerant. You can choose the plants that fit your aesthetic! We then add river rocks and boulders on the top layer of the garden to help slow the velocity of water coming out of the downspouts.\nIf you’re looking for plants in the GTA, we highly recommend the nursery Native Plants in Claremont, they’re committed to promoting Ontario’s native plants and specialize in seed grown native perennial wildflowers, grasses, and shrubs.\nStep iv: top with Mulch.\nOnce all of the plants are in, we cover your new garden with a layer of mulch or wood chips. This layer is from 5-10cm and is an essential part of the process. The mulch helps with the filtration and absorption of rainwater and assists in keeping out weeds while also resisting drought. Lastly, it ties your garden together by giving it a neat and tidy appearance.\nDon’t Want to Build it Yourself?\nLet Us Do the Heavy Lifting!\nSchedule a rain garden consultation\nIf you live in Toronto or the GTA and would like to hire someone to install your rain garden get in touch with us to schedule a consultation and estimate! We work with the best people to provide a quality service and experience.\ndecide on a concept design and any additional landscaping elements or stonework\nWe work with the experts, Rain Garden United, to put together a plan and concept design to create the best option for your property. We’ll consult with you to decide on the location, size, and style of your rain garden. Want to add an interlock patio or natural stone steps? Inka Stoneworks specializes in hardscaping and can handle any additional elements that you’d like to add to your project.\nHow long will it take to install? The project installation could range from 1-2 days for a small garden and up to a week for a large garden.\nHow much does a rain garden Cost?\nBuilding a rain garden can be a cost-effective landscaping solution for your yard. If you want to hire a contractor to install the garden for you, the price will depend on the size and scope of the project. Remember, this is an investment! At Inka Stoneworks, installing a rain garden will range anywhere from $3000 to $15,000 depending on the size and complexity of the landscaping project. This includes the project consultation and plan, excavation, selecting the right native plants, installing the garden and disposal of any unwanted materials.\nWant to learn more about rain gardens?
