1	Looking at cell content: are both sieve elements and xylem cells alive?	No. Sieve elements are living cells (though without nucleus), while xylem elements are dead cells with hollow columns reinforced with lignin and no cell contents, nucleus, or cytoplasm.	"['A single cell which may be the fertilised egg or the zygote, from where the life of an organism is starts. This single cell undergoes repeated mitotic division to form a multi-cellular embryo and finally the organism gradually differentiates. The stages of formation of a multi-cellular organism are as follow:\nCells → tissue → tissue system → organ → organ system → body.\nBut in the unicellular organism all physiological functions are carried out by a single cell, so this organisation is not found. In higher plants, tissue systems are of three types; those are:\nWhat is tissue?\nA tissue is defined as a group of organised cells with a common origin, function and similar or different structures. We are going to have a brief discussion about the plant tissue.\nClassification of plant tissue: –\nThe plant tissue can be classified into three categories on the basis of the divisional power.\n1) Meristematic tissue: It can be broadly classified on the basis of origin, occurrence, function and division.\n2) Permanent tissue: It can be simple or complex.\n3) Special tissue: It can be broadly classified into External secretory and internal secretory types. Actually it is a permanent tissue.\nThe group of cells with similar origin and function and having similar or dissimilar structure, constitute a tissue.\nThe plant tissue which is in active state of division is known as meristematic tissue or meristem. They may be classified on the basis of occurrence as apical, intercalary and lateral meristem, on the basis of origin as primary and secondary meristem, on the basis of function as protoderm, pro-cambium and ground meristem and as rib meristem, plate meristem and mass meristem on plane and division basis.\nThe plant tissue which has not any power of division is called permanent tissue. It can be classified primarily into three types as simple complex and special tissue. The simple permanent tissues have similar type of cells and they are of three types. Those are the parenchyma, the collenchymas and the sclerenchyma. The parenchyma tissues have thin cellulosic walls; the collenchymas of the plant tissue have unequally thickened walls. On the other hand sclerenchymas are dead elements with evenly thickened walls.\nThe permanent tissue with heterogeneous elements is known as complex tissue. This plant tissue is mainly of two types, i.e., xylem and phloem. Both of them constitute the vascular bundle. Xylem tissue is composed of four major elements. Those are the tracheid, the trachea, the xylem parenchyma and the xylem fibres. One of them that are the xylem parenchyma is only the living tissue. Likewise the phloem elements include sieve cells, sieve tubes, companion cells, phloem- parenchyma and phloem fibres. Sieve cells are common in gymnosperms and pteridophytes, but sieve tube is common in angiosperms.\nIn plant tissue the xylem conducts minerals and water from the roots to leaves in upward direction; on the other hand the phloem brought the prepared food from leaves to upward, downward and lateral directions. Sieve elements are living without nucleus, while phloem parenchyma and companion cells are living but phloem fibres are dead elements.\nThe special plant tissue includes specific group of cells with specialised function of secretion. They are either secretory or excretory in nature.', ""Other slides in this set\nXylem is a plant transport tissue that carries\nwater and minerals from the roots to the rest of\nthe plant.

2	norway underwater tourist looking for max diving depth lygnstylsvatnet submerged village	The maximum diving depth at Lygnstøylsvatnet lake is 13 meters, where you can find the largest trees of the underwater forest.	['Imagine you are floating through crystal clear water, looking down at what looks to be an enchanted forest. You can see the remains of a settlement, the roads and stone fences used to herd sheep and transport goods over a hundred years ago.\nWelcome to Norway’s Atlantis, welcome to Lygnstøylsvatnet.\n[icon name=”location-arrow” class=”” unprefixed_class=””] Destination: Sunnmøre, Norangsdalen, Lygnstøylsvatnet\n[icon name=”bullseye” class=”” unprefixed_class=””] GPS:62°10’30.6″N 6°43’44.0″E\n[icon name=”area-chart” class=”” unprefixed_class=””] Maximum 13 meters\n[icon name=”clock-o” class=”” unprefixed_class=””] Time: 45min each dive\n[icon name=”area-chart” class=”” unprefixed_class=””] Height: 152 meters\n[icon name=”angle-double-up” class=”” unprefixed_class=””] Difficulty: Medium\n[icon name=”sun-o” class=”” unprefixed_class=””] Season: Spring, Summer, Autumn\n[icon name=”tencent-weibo” class=”” unprefixed_class=””] Type: Diving/Freediving\n[icon name=”cogs” class=”” unprefixed_class=””] Special Equipment: Scuba/Freediving gear\nHow it came to be\nLake Lygnstøylsvatnet, situated in Nordangsdalen Valley in the West of Norway, is one of the most amazing dive destinations in Norway. Originally there shouldn’t be a lake to dive in, but the 26th of May 1908, the 1218 meters tall mountain Keipen cracked. A large amount of rocks came crashing down the mountain side, creating a dam across the valley. The river was blocked and the water had nowhere to go. Slowly the valley filled with water, and thus Lygnstøylsvatnet was created.\nOn clear, calm days you can actually see some of the remains just by parking and looking out your car window. However, the experience is most rewarding for those who can scuba or freedive down to 5-13 meters, and swim through the remains of the old road, the forest and the farm houses.\nWhat to see\nWhen scuba or free diving, you will be able to see the remains of nine farm buildings, two bridges, a farm road, stone fences, a gate, and most importantly; a mesmerizing underwater forest consisting of bare apple trees, over a hundred years old, frozen in time.\nHow to find the lake?\nFinding the lake is quite easy; You follow country road 655, between Hellesylt and Øye in Sunnmøre, or simply enter Lygnstøylsvatnet into google maps. You will pass several smaller lakes, but once you reach Lygnstøylen, you will see a plackard stating that this is the Lygnstøylsvatnet lake. Weather permitting, you might also be able to see some of the old farm buildings from the shore. There are a few parking spaces available by the lake.\nHow many dives?\nThe visibility of the lake varies from crystal clear to murky, depending on how rainy the weather has been the previous days. The more rain, the more sediments are dragged into the lake from the mountains, making the visibility bad.\nWe believe that you will be able to experience the most important features of Lygnstøylsvatnet in two (scuba) dives. Thus, we have made a suggestion as to how you can perform these two dives; one longer dive at the south west end of the lake, and a shorter second dive at the north west side of the lake. Take a look at the map above to look at the main points of interest. These are approximate placements, but they should be close enough to navigate by. If you don’t want to do scuba diving, it is also perfectly possible to have a nice free diving session at the lake, and we highly recommend this as well as scuba diving.\nRelated Posts: How to get stunning underwater video from a GoPro\nDIVE 1 – The tunnel and forest:\nDescend, and start off by swimming close to the fences you will see from the starting point. Follow the fences a bit south, and you will arrive at the first bridge at about 5-6 meters depth. It is great fun to swim through it, but be careful not to kick up too much sediments, as this will possibly annoy the diver following behind you.\nAfter swimming under the bridge, it is nice to follow the “riverbed” into the mysterious forest at about 10 meters depth. If you want to see more of the forest, you can swim east for an extended period. If you do this, you will see even bigger trees at about 12-13 meters depth. Please remember: All the trees in the lake are very brittle, and very little contact is necessary to break them. Be mindful of your fins and your arms, and never lean on the trees. The branches can snap quite easily. Keep that buoyancy controlled!\nAfter enjoying the forest you can swim northwest and arrive at the road. Continue towards north east to shallower waters, and you will find the old farms at 2-3 meters depths. This is a very nice place to perform your safety stop. Surface when you feel like it, and walk or swim back to the starting point.\nGet out of the water, get yourself a cup of coffee, and get excited for your next dive!\nDIVE 2 – The road and old farms:\nThe second dive covers a shorter distance, and gives you time to enjoy the old buildings and the large rocks in the land slide. Start descending near the fences until you reach the road at about 5 meters depth. Swim north while following the road, and you will soon reach the landslide with its massive rocks, at about 6-7 meters depth. At the end of the road, you will also find the second bridge, which you can also swim under. Turn around, and ascend to 2-3 meters depth. Swim back towards the starting point, while checking out the old farms and fences along the way.\nDiving in Lygnstøylsvatnet is quite easy, as it is not so deep. However, it requires good buoyancy control. We want to stress the fact that you should never lean on any of the fragile trees, and that it is not considered good dive etiquette to stir up sediments from the bottom, making it murky for the divers following behind. You should also be mindful that the drive to and from Lygnstøylsvatnet could include mountain passes. All in all, be considerate and careful, so that Lygnstøylsvatnet will continue to be a place we can all visit and enjoy in the future as well 🙂\nLars made a movie from some of the scuba dives we’ve had at Lygnstøylsvatnet. It was recorded over a period of 3 dives. The weather conditions were cloudy and we experienced some rain, but the underwater conditions were absolutely fantastic.

3	How do sports fields benefit youth development and community economic growth?	Sports fields provide significant benefits for both youth development and community economic growth. For youth development, they serve as outdoor classrooms where children learn life skills through sports like baseball - including resilience, accountability, and teamwork. Research shows that children who are physically active become active adults, and those who participate in sports perform better academically. From an economic perspective, well-maintained sports facilities attract tournaments and visitors who support local restaurants, hotels, and businesses. For example, modern facilities with features like sustainable turf and upgraded lighting can operate year-round, enabling communities to host everything from recreational teams to collegiate tournaments, generating tourism revenue and fostering community pride.	['Toronto Blue Jays go to bat for Foothills youth\nPAUL KRAJEWSKI HIGH RIVER TIMES/POSTMEDIA NETWORK. Representatives of the Jays Care Foundation presented the Boys and Girls Clubs of the Foothills a $150,000 Field of Dreams grant for the building of a baseball facility between Turner Valley and Black Diamond. (Seen above) Members and staff from clubs in High River, Black Diamond, Nanton and Turner Valley, Alta., along with municipal politicians, celebrated the project’s announcement at the Black Diamond club on Aug. 4, 2017.\nBy Paul Krajewski\nBlack Diamond and the Toronto Blue Jays have teamed up to build a baseball diamond for the Boys and Girls Clubs of the Foothills.\nWhen complete, children and youth from clubs in High River, Nanton, Black Diamond and Turner Valley will have access to a brand new facility worth over $200,000.\nAs “Canada’s baseball team,” Robert Witchel, Jays Care Foundation executive director, said the organization, which acts as the charitable arm for the professional baseball team, invests in kids across the country.\nDuring a cheque presentation at the Black Diamond club on Aug. 4, he said the foundation, which in 2014 helped the Town of High River rebuild three flood-damaged diamonds, is keen on creating safe spaces for kids to play and grow.\nIt contributed $150,000 from its Field of Dreams program, an infrastructure grant for facilities that nurture life-skill and physical development, toward the project, Witchel said.\nHe noted the organization invested $2 million across Canada this year.\n“A ball diamond is like an outdoor classroom where (kids) learn all sorts of skills,” he explained.\n“(A youth) can’t develop into a normal, active adult without playing as a kid—it’s how they learn. We know through research that if they were active as a child they will be active as an adult.”\nWitchel said youth develop strong, healthy routines through sports and physical activity.\n“Baseball is an incredible game to teach life skills because it’s a game of failure,” he said. “If you miss seven out of 10 times in the course of your career, you’re a 0.300 hitter and you’re probably going to the Hall of Fame,” he added.\nParticipating in sports helps children develop resiliency to adversity and challenges, giving them the ability to preservere through life’s ups and downs, Witchel noted\nIt also teaches them accountability and responsibility and the skills to lead with confidence and work as team, he added.\nShirley Puttock, the club’s executive director, said 600 Foothills youth and children will have direct access to the facility.\n“It’s exciting the foundation found the time to come out to present a cheque ... to help us build our Field of Dreams ball diamond,” she said. “We are the only organization in Alberta this year to receive the funds, so we are thrilled they could make it out here.”\nPuttock said clubs will use the facility to deliver a variety of baseball and sports programming.\nThe facility will also benefit the community and surrounding region, she said. Schools, community organizations, clubs, sports teams and the general public will be able to utilize the field on evenings and weekends.\nPuttock said the collective leading the project wants the facility to be equipped with a paved parking lot, concession building, dugouts and bleachers.\n“We want it all,” she said, adding the benefits of the facility are worth the investment. “Children that participate in sports do better in academics, so we see a great future for them.”\nThe ball diamond will be built on a 26-acre municipally-owned property in the MD of Foothills, half way between Turner Valley and Black Diamond, along the Sheep River and Friendship Trail.\nGlen Fagan, mayor of Black Diamond, said the municipality contributed $77,500, plus land, to the project because its impact will be experienced throughout the Foothills.\n“It’s not just for our community or the community across the river—it’s for the whole region,” he said. “This is going to open an opportunity for baseball across the region, and it happens to be situated right central in between our two towns, so it’s a good neighbourly thing as well.”\nFagan said the facility will attract more visitors to the area and could encourage economic development along the corridor between the two towns.\n“I’m so proud of the Boys and Girls Club for having taken on this (initiative) and adventure and for the foundation for supporting this and bringing that money to our community,” he added.\nShannon Slabotsky, Turner Valley mother of three, said the project will “open up a lot of doors” for the two communities.\n“We have a lot to offer and a lot of people don’t even know we exist,” she said, noting the increased traffic to the area could bring more tourism, newcomers and business.\nAbove all, she said it give kids, like her three who are all baseball fans, a place to call their own—somewhere they can grow as ball players and individuals.\n“It gets our kids active so they’re not sitting inside playing video games,” she said. “They are actually outside playing sports. That’s how I grew up and that’s how I want my kids to grow up.”\nShe said baseball is in an inclusive sport.\n“It doesn’t take a lot, just a glove, bat and ball,” she added.\nWhile the project is currently in its planning phase, Puttock said construction is estimated to begin this October. Once complete, she said Black Diamond will take ownership of the facility by providing ongoing maintenance and upkeep.', 'The City of Sierra Vista recently unveiled new sports fields to residents, marking the beginning of a larger initiative to increase pride, engagement, and sports tourism in the scenic Southern Arizona locale. The sustainable turf and upgraded lighting are designed to help the players on the field, and the bottom line off the field. As one component of Sierra Vista’s comprehensive electrical infrastructure modernization project, the complex will contribute to a total energy savings and projected revenue generation of over $20 million for the city.\nLaura Wilson, Director, Leisure and Library Services for the City of Sierra Vista, celebrated the Domingo Paiz Soccer Fields project completion with an event for all residents to enjoy. Wilson has served the city in various capacities since 1996 and has taken an active role in the economic development of her community.\nHere are her takeaways on how the modernization project will impact the city she loves:\nWhy did the City of Sierra Vista choose to do this renovation to the sports complex?\nOur sports fields required some significant improvements due to continuous usage by our extremely active sports community. Identifying funding opportunities to make the necessary repairs was challenging. Tying these projects in with an Energy Performance Contract gave us an opportunity to deliver optimal results for our regular users while also providing extraordinary tournament options in southeastern Arizona.\nThe improvements provide 24/7 access, 365 days per year, by eliminating the need for annual closures for field rehabilitation. They also reduce staff time and materials needed for maintenance and field lining prep, while reducing water usage and energy consumption.\nBest of all, the renovated sports complex creates many opportunities for partnerships throughout our region and beyond that can bolster efforts to attract new tournaments, visitors, and dollars to Sierra Vista.\nHow does a project like this one impact the community?\nI think having well maintained and environmentally-conscious facilities helps the City foster a sense of pride in our community felt by local residents and business owners. We hope these improved facilities will help our residents enjoy an active lifestyle year-round, create new community partnerships, and bring visitors to our area who will enjoy our local restaurants, bars, hotels, and businesses, which will bolster the City’s sports tourism efforts.\nWhat new opportunities or goals are achievable with this renovation, that previously the community wouldn’t have been able to do?\nMany of our community sports teams would leave the area fairly regularly to participate in year-round league play and tournaments. Our previous field conditions left us with limited options for providing safe, tournament-conditioned play surfaces due to multiple maintenance closures, which contributed to limited availability.\nThe improved soccer facilities are pre-marked for multiple age-group play, which includes a field that meets NCAA dimensions. These fields are ready to go 365 days a year, which gives us an opportunity to welcome everything from recreational teams to international and collegiate teams to our community for trainings, games, tournaments, ID Camps, friendly matches, etc. Our climate in southeast Arizona is typically 10-15 degrees cooler than Phoenix and Tucson year-round, so it provides unique opportunities during summer months for those wishing to beat the heat.\nWe have chosen Eco Therm as our fill, which is 100% biodegradable and keeps turf conditions up to 20 degrees cooler for player comfort. Our softball and baseball fields are natural turf and well-maintained year-round.\nThe state-of-the-art Musco LED lighting in all of our sports complexes provides better player visibility, less-glare, and protects our beautiful dark skies from light pollution. Our multi-purpose fields also provide space for additional field markings on natural grass if needed. These significant improvements to our facilities allow us to meet the growing demands of the sporting community without increasing our current footprint. It is a much more efficient use of current space.\nWhat does the community think of the upgraded athletic facilities?\nSo far, I have only received positive feedback about the facilities from the users and we certainly appreciate their patience during construction. Our residents feel the improved facilities have been well worth the wait!\nThe city is set to wrap up construction on upgrades city-wide—including the police department, city hall, community wave pool, additional soccer fields, main outdoor event venue, and wastewater operations park—early this year.']	['<urn:uuid:fd0b087c-ce17-4528-89fe-c4bc6f07688c>', '<urn:uuid:270cba53-6863-4f2d-80b7-ee0d4c19f679>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	11	107	1620
4	blowfish encryption advantages disadvantages	Blowfish is a symmetric encryption algorithm that offers several advantages: it's fast, free, license-free, and highly resistant against differential and linear cryptanalysis attacks. The algorithm uses large key-dependent S-boxes and supports variable key lengths from 32 to 448 bits. However, its main disadvantage is that it requires large memory space for the lookup tables generated during key scheduling, making it unsuitable for environments with limited memory. The only known attacks against Blowfish are based on its weak key classes.	['Total views : 407\nA Dynamic 3D S-Box based on Cylindrical Coordinate System for Blowfish Algorithm\nBlowfish Algorithm (BA) is a symmetric block cipher that uses Feistel network to iterate simple encryption and decryption functions. The BA key varies from 32 to 448 bits to ensure a high level of security. However, S-boxes in the BA have a high percentage of memory. A new cryptography algorithm based on BA is designed to overcome this problem. This algorithm adapts a new function (F-function) into a Cylindrical Coordinate System (CCS). The F-function is known as Cylindrical Coordinate System with Dynamic Permutation Box (CCSDPB). The study involved three phases: design, implementation, and verification. In the first phase, dynamic 3D S-box, dynamic P-box, and F-function were designed. The second phase involved performing key expansion, data encryption, and data decryption. Verification includes evaluating the output of the new design using the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) randomness statistical test and cryptanalysis. Results of the statistical tests show that the new design is suitable with any data stream, including a long string of identical bytes. The combination of a dynamic permutation box with a dynamic 3D S-box is an effective approach that strengthens the design resistance against attacks such as differential, linear, and short attacks, as well as and increase the randomness of outputs.\nCylindrical Coordinate System, Dynamic 3D S-Box, Dynamic P-Box, NIST Statistical Tests\n- Schneier B.

Each of these three encryption methods have their own uses, advantages, and disadvantages. Hashing, for example, is very resistant to tampering, but is not as flexible as the other methods. All three forms of encryption rely on cryptography, or the science of scrambling data.\nPeople use encryption to change readable text, also called plaintext, into an unreadable secret format, called ciphertext. Encrypting data provides additional benefits besides protecting the confidentiality of a message. These advantages include ensuring that messages have not been altered during transit and verifying the identity of the sender. All of these benefits can be realized by using any of these three encryption methods.\nThe first encryption method, called hashing, creates a unique and fixed-length signature for a message or data set. Hashes are created with an algorithm, or hash function, and people commonly use them to compare sets of data. Since a hash is unique to a specific message, even minor changes to that message result in a dramatically different hash, thereby alerting a user to potential tampering.\nA key difference between hashing and the other two encryption methods is that once the data is encrypted, the process cannot be reversed or deciphered. This means that even if a potential attacker were able to obtain a hash, they would not be able to use a decryption method to discover the contents of the original message. Some common hashing algorithms are Message Digest 5 (MD5) and Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA).\nSymmetric cryptography, also called private-key cryptography, is one of the oldest and most secure encryption methods. The term “private key” comes from the fact that the key used to encrypt and decrypt data must remain secure because anyone with access to it can read the coded messages. A sender encodes a message into ciphertext using a key, and the receiver uses the exact same key to decode it.\nPeople can use this encryption method as either a “stream” cipher or a “block” cipher, depending on the amount of data being encrypted or decrypted at a time. A stream cipher encrypts data one character at a time as it is sent or received, while a block cipher processes fixed chunks of data. Common symmetric encryption algorithms include Data Encryption Standard (DES), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA).\nAsymmetric, or public key cryptography is potentially more secure than symmetric methods of encryption. This type of cryptography uses two keys, a “private” key and a “public key”, to perform encryption and decryption. The use of two keys overcomes a major weakness in symmetric key cryptography, since a single key does not need to be securely managed among multiple users. Public-key encryption was first described in a secret document in 1973, before then all encryption schemes were symmetric-key.\nIn asymmetric cryptography, a public key is freely available to everyone and used to encrypt messages before sending them. A different, private key remains with the receiver of ciphertext messages, who uses it to decrypt them. Algorithms that use public key encryption methods include RSA and Diffie-Hellman.\nSymmetric Algorithms Available\nAES stands for Advanced Encryption Standard. AES is a symmetric key encryption technique which replaces the commonly used Data Encryption Standard (DES). It was the result of a worldwide call for submissions of encryption algorithms issued by the US Government’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1997 and completed in 2000.\nIn response to the growing feasibility of attacks against DES, NIST launched a call for proposals for an official successor that meets 21st century security needs. This successor is called the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Five algorithms were selected into the second round, from which Rijndael was selected to be the final standard. NIST gave as its reasons for selecting Rijndael that it performs very well in hardware and software across a wide range of environments in all possible modes. It has excellent key setup time and has low memory requirements, in addition its operations are easy to defend against power and timing attacks. NIST stated that all five finalists had adequate security and that there was nothing wrong with the other four ciphers.\nThe winning algorithm was developed by two Belgian cryptologists, Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemen. AES provides strong encryption and was selected by NIST as a Federal Information Processing Standard in November 2001 (FIPS-197). Rijndael follows the tradition of square ciphers. AES algorithm uses three key sizes: a 128-, 192-, or 256-bit encryption key. Each encryption key size causes the algorithm to behave slightly differently, so the increasing key sizes not only offer a larger number of bits with which you can scramble the data, but also increase the complexity of the cipher algorithm.\nBlowfish is a symmetric encryption algorithm designed in 1993 by Bruce Schneier as an alternative to existing encryption algorithms. Blowfish has a 64-bit block size and a variable key length – from 32 bits to 448 bits. It is a 16-round Feistel cipher and uses large key-dependent S-boxes. While doing key scheduling, it generates large pseudo-random lookup tables by doing several encryptions. The tables depend on the user supplied key in a very complex way. This approach has been proven to be highly resistant against many attacks such as differential and linear cryptanalysis. Unfortunately, this also means that it is not the algorithm of choice for environments where a large memory space is not available. Blowfish is similar in structure to CAST-128, which uses fixed S-boxes.\nSince 1993 Blowfish has been analyzed considerably, and is gaining acceptance as a strong encryption algorithm. Blowfish was designed as a fast, free alternative to existing encryption algorithms. Blowfish is unpatented and license-free, and is available to uses as a free solution.\nThe only known attacks against Blowfish are based on its weak key classes.\nCAST stands for Carlisle Adams and Stafford Tavares, the inventors of CAST. CAST is a popular 64-bit block cipher which belongs to the class of encryption algorithms known as Feistel ciphers. CAST-128 is a DES-like Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) cryptosystem. It has the Feistel structure and utilizes eight fixed S-boxes. CAST-128 supports variable key lenghts between 40 and 128 bits.\nCAST-128 is resistant to both linear and differential cryptanalysis. Currently, there is no known way of breaking CAST short of brute force. CAST is now the default cipher in PGP.\nData Encryption Standard (DES)\nDigital Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric block cipher with 64-bit block size that uses using a 56-bit key.\nIn 1977 the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a symmetric algorithm, was adopted in the United States as a federal standard. DES encrypts and decrypts data in 64-bit blocks, using a 56-bit key. It takes a 64-bit block of plaintext as input and outputs a 64-bit block of ciphertext. Since it always operates on blocks of equal size and it uses both permutations and substitutions in the algorithm. DES has 16 rounds, meaning the main algorithm is repeated 16 times to produce the ciphertext. It has been found that the number of rounds is exponentially proportional to the amount of time required to find a key using a brute-force attack. So as the number of rounds increases, the security of the algorithm increases exponentially.\nFor many years, DES-enciphered data were safe because few organizations possessed the computing power to crack it. But in July 1998 a team of cryptographers cracked a DES-enciphered message in 3 days, and in 1999 a network of 10,000 desktop PCs cracked a DES-enciphered message in less than a day. DES was clearly no longer invulnerable and since then Triple DES (3DES) has emerged as a stronger method.\nTriple DES encrypts data three times and uses a different key for at least one of the three passes giving it a cumulative key size of 112-168 bits. That should produce an expected strength of something like 112 bits, which is more than enough to defeat brute force attacks. Triple DES is much stronger than (single) DES, however, it is rather slow compared to some new block ciphers. However, cryptographers have determined that triple DES is unsatisfactory as a long-term solution, and in 1997, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) solicited proposals for a cipher to replace DES entirely, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).\nIDEA stands for International Data Encryption Algorithm. IDEA is a symmetric encryption algorithm that was developed by Dr. X. Lai and Prof. J. Massey to replace the DES standard. Unlike DES though it uses a 128 bit key. This key length makes it impossible to break by simply trying every key. It has been one of the best publicly known algorithms for some time. It has been around now for several years, and no practical attacks on it have been published despite of numerous attempts to analyze it. IDEA is resistant to both linear and differential analysis.\nRC2 is a variable-key-length cipher. It was invented by Ron Rivest for RSA Data Security, Inc. Details for this algorithm have not been published.\nRC4 was developed by Ron Rivest in 1987. It is a variable-key-size stream cipher. It is a cipher with a key size of up to 2048 bits (256 bytes). The algorithm is very fast. Its security is unknown, but breaking it does not seem trivial either. Because of its speed, it may have uses in certain applications. It accepts keys of arbitrary length. RC4 is essentially a pseudo random number generator, and the output of the generator is exclusive-ored with the data stream. For this reason, it is very important that the same RC4 key never be used to encrypt two different data streams.\nRC6 is a symmetric key block cipher derived from RC5. It was designed by Ron Rivest, Matt Robshaw, Ray Sidney, and Yiqun Lisa Yin to meet the requirements of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) competition. RC6 encryption algorithm was selected among the other finalists to become the new federal Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).\nSEED is a block cipher developed by the Korea Information Security Agency since 1998. Both the block and key size of SEED are 128 bits and it has a Feistel Network structure which is iterated 16 times. It has been designed to resist differential and linear cryptanalysis as well as related key attacks. SEED uses two 8×8 S-boxes and mixes the XOR operation with modular addition. SEED has been adopted as an ISO/IEC standard (ISO/IEC 18033-3), an IETF RFC, RFC 4269 as well as an industrial association standard of Korea (TTAS.KO-12.0004/0025).\nSerpent is a very fast and reasonably secure block cipher developed by Ross Anderson, Eli Biham and Lars Knudsen. Serpent can work with different combinations of key lengths. Serpent was also selected among other five finalists to become the new federal Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).\nTiny Encryption Algorithm is a very fast and moderately secure cipher produced by David Wheeler and Roger Needham of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. There is a known weakness in the key schedule, so it is not recommended if utmost security is required. TEA is provided in 16 and 32 round versions. The more rounds (iterations), the more secure, but this also makes this solution slower.\nTriple DES is a variation of Data Encryption Standard (DES). It uses a 64-bit key consisting of 56 effective key bits and 8 parity bits. The size of the block for Triple-DES is 8 bytes. Triple-DES encrypts the data in 8-byte chunks. The idea behind Triple DES is to improve the security of DES by applying DES encryption three times using three different keys. Triple DES algorithm is very secure (major banks use it to protect valuable transactions), but it is also very slow.\nTwofish is a symmetric block cipher. Twofish has a block size of 128 bits and accepts keys of any length up to 256 bits.Twofish has key dependent S-boxes like Blowfish. Twofish encryption algorithm was designed by Bruce Schneier, John Kelsey, Chris Hall, Niels Ferguson, David Wagner and Doug Whiting. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) investigated Twofish as one of the candidates for the replacement of the DES encryption algorithm.']	['<urn:uuid:0fdf9f4f-7080-4624-b966-0e7bf7d642e2>', '<urn:uuid:fc312741-9f6c-4a2c-8c78-fddcd81679c9>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	4	79	3088
5	What makes an art show temporary and how is art preserved?	Art exhibitions are inherently transient with defined timelines, and their temporary nature requires careful preservation measures. The physical environment must be strictly controlled - relative humidity should be maintained between 35-50% with a 5% tolerance, and temperature must be regulated to prescribed levels. Long-standing exhibits particularly need protection from light exposure, which can cause gradual but significant damage. This is evidenced in contemporary exhibitions like the one at Migros Museum für Gegenwartskunst, where installations such as '72 Paintings' required specific display conditions and documentation materials related to their creation process.	['In Zurich, Maria Eichhorn (Bamberg, Germany, 1962) just opened her most syncretic exhibition, wisely installed into Migros Museum für Gegenwartskunst and titled Zwölf Arbeiten / Twelve Works (1988–2018). Tautologically, twelve selected artworks, dating from the past thirty years, encourage the viewers to reflect on several evidences and to engage a meticulous dialogue between speculative coalescences and material narratives.\nThe exhibited works represent twelve milestones, twelve landmarks from Eicchorn’s career: Κτίριο ως περιουσία άνευ ιδιοκτήτη / Building as Unowned Property (2017); Limmatstrasse 270, 8005 Zürich (2011/2018); Hall Broom (2011); Militant (2010); Paper Bags (2009/2018); l’acédie, l’orgueil […] (2009/2018); 輸入禁制品 / Prohibited Imports (2003); Cart / 90 Posters (1995/2018); 72 Paintings (1992–93); Four Corners of a Removed Sheet of Paper (1992); Curtain (Orange) (1989/2001/2018); and finally Rolled up Banner (1988/2018).\nHer works are the result of a careful and precise artistic practice in which the artist breaks through our familiar patterns of perception. Often, with the most minimal interventions and the use of simple and sometimes old techniques, Eichhorn succeeds in bringing new life to the apparently unambiguous content of objects and phenomena from our everyday life, and open up unexpected spaces for interpretation. Embodying her oeuvre, Migros Museum für Gegenwartskunst focuses on large-scale productions in close cooperation with the artist. Here, the Contemporary art is conceived as a dynamic temporal classification that encompasses an ongoing exploration between looking forwards and looking back. At the same time, the term implies integration into a social context, as well as involvement in an ongoing exchange of ideas and in art production. The exhibitions at the Migros Museum für Gegenwartskunst frame art history as a dynamic process that is open to scrutiny, revision, and variation. Incorporating the collection into a lively environment that is in contact with, and promotes, contemporary art production and addresses sensitive audiences is another objective of the museum.\nActually, the most extended installation, displaced in Zwölf Arbeiten / Twelve Works, is 72 Paintings (1992–93), belonging to Migros Museum für Gegenwartskunst’s collection. This exhibition is the first parcours showing 72 Paintings in a single row, the series takes up the entire upstairs gallery. The presentation is completed by a display case with documentary materials related to the process of making the work. The painting installation was part of the project Toile / Pinceau / Peinture inside the exhibition Qui, Quoi, Où (22.10.1992 – 17.1.1993) displaced at the Musée d’Art moderne de la Ville de Paris. When the show, which ran exactly for 72 days, opened, 72 primed canvases (each 123x93 cm) had been hanging on the wall in three stacks, and a chair stood by a table on which three cardboard boxes filled with 72 different oil paints from the Lukas Studio range, 72 brushes, and various other painting supplies as well as a copy of the book Scent and Chemistry. The Molecular World of Fragrances had been set out. A wall calendar showed a schedule for each day of the exhibition; altogether 36 people, the majority of them museum employees, had signed up to pick a colour and paint a monochrome canvas.\nAt Migros Museum für Gegenwartskunst among rolls of stacking paper, folded sheets of paper and posters originating from programs of activists, the ephemeral statute of the oeuvre challenges time: Eichhorn achieves illusionistic effects, following a great art historical tradition. But on the contrary to that tradition she reveals the foundations of her research a moment later, so that the illusion usually lasts only a short time. In Eichhorn’s works, the magic that goes beyond the initial surprise and prompts reflection lies precisely in this interplay of expectation and disappointment, as in Κτίριο ως περιουσία άνευ ιδιοκτήτη / Building as Unowned Property (2017).\nThe piece encompasses all processes related to the conversion of a property in Athens into an unowned asset as well as the documents that accumulate in the process of the transfer of title. Conceived on occasion of documenta 14 in Athens, the work is concerned with the city’s urban fabric, where high vacancy rates, especially in the centre, are a conspicuous indicator of the social and economic crisis in Greece. By converting a vacant building in Athens into an unowned property, the artist creates a sculpture in the urban space that belongs to no one.\n- Exhibition Title:\n- Maria Eichhorn Zwölf Arbeiten / Twelve Works (1988–2018)\n- Opening dates:\n- From November 20, 2018 to February 3, 2019\n- Curated by:\n- Dr. Raphael Gygax\n- Migros Museum für Gegenwartskunst\n- Limmatstrasse 270, CH–8005, Zurich', 'A space especially reserved to showcase objects of artistic inclination, a platform for interaction between the art object and the viewer and a place of business for the artist, collectors and other stakeholders in the intriguing world of art. An exhibition or a show or exposition (as they are sometimes called in the US) may showcase paintings, photographs, drawings, audio, video, interactive art, installation, new media art, performance or sculpture by individual artists or a group of artists or belonging to a common theme or issue.\nThe nature of such shows or exhibitions is transient with a defined timeline, the duration of which may vary greatly. The shows or exhibitions may be organized at a variety of venues like museums, art clubs or halls, private art galleries or even some venues that may not be directly linked to the business of art like a café.\nOne of the factors that sets these apart is the intent of the display, some venues may put up all or most of the exhibits up to be sold like in the private art galleries, some of these venues do it simply as an educative experience and some with an intent to celebrate or commemorate special occasions or events.\nTYPES OF EXHIBITIONS\nThe types are largely sectioned into two – commercial and non-commercial exhibitions and there is very clear distinction with the two.\nThese exhibitions are such that the participating artists or art dealers who are showcasing their work pay a fee. Examples of this particular kind of exhibitions are art fairs, vanity gallery, temporary museum exhibitions – where the viewer may have to pay extra (on top of the entry ticket to the museum) to enter this space.\nNon Commercial Exhibitions\nThese do not have much of a payment aspect attached to it. The non-commercial exhibitions can be juried, invitational or open.\nA juried exhibition has an individual or a group of individuals as judge/jury to appreciate the submitted works and select the ones that would finally be put on display. There may also be a declaration of winners.\nAn invitational exhibition is one where the organizers of the show invite certain artists or group of artists to supply their artworks, which are then displayed at the event.\nAn open exhibition allows everyone to enter their artworks and the exhibition puts each one of them on display.\nMost artworks that are put up in an exhibition of any kind are of a certain value and some of them might be quite fragile. The fragility or the structure of the exhibit is one of the most important factors that is often overlooked. Each individual exhibit needs to be analyzed for all the concerns it may have and then the method of display is worked on to ensure minimum damage and maximum care for its preservation. The four main concerns that need to be looked into with regard to a safe display of the exhibits are listed under.\nThe physical environment of the place where the exhibition is meant to happen is an important deciding factor for preservation and care of the exhibits. The climate and weather conditions are some obvious environmental factors that need to be kept in mind while planning the event. The kind of light the exhibits would be exposed to and the effect it might have on individual exhibits, especially on the ink and pigments on certain exhibits. The relative humidity of the space should be somewhere between 35-50% with a 5% tolerance. This is especially important for vellum and parchment materials as their might contract or expand drastically if the humidity is unfavorable. The temperature also needs to be maintained at a prescribed level as per the exhibits to ensure a safe and caring environment.\nThe length of the exhibition is a factor that comes into a strong play in the matters concerning preservation. Long standing exhibits are exposed to the elements for a longer time especially light, which may cause gradual but significant damage. The duration of display of exhibits, particularly in the museums needs to be on rotational basis, giving the exhibits a time to rest and an opportunity for conservation. Additionally the exhibits need a constant inspection and vigilance to make sure that any signs of damage are noticed immediately and are taken care of at the earliest.\nIndividual Display Cases\nThe exhibits in a museum or library exhibitions are displayed in individual display cases or frames. Depending on the form and format of the exhibit, the orientation and placement of these cases is decided. Small or single-page exhibits may be displayed in vertical cases. Three dimensional, heavy, open or closed book and flat paper objects can be easily exhibited in horizontal cases. The material of the cases needs to be decided as per the nature and fragility of the exhibit to maximize their life.\nThe exhibits that form the exhibition are the highlight. The exhibits are exposed to people from all walks of life and business. The viewers may appreciate it but some might lack awareness or sensitivity. In other cases the intent to harm or maliciously acquire the piece might also affect the security of the exhibits. Each individual piece needs separate locks and the entire venue should be aptly guarded and patrolled for the safety of the exhibits.\nIMPACT & RELATIONSHIP WITH\nThe exhibition becomes a platform for an artist to showcase his work. It is only by exhibiting his work for an audience that an artist stands to gain fame, money and recognition. It is a space where he exposes his work to the intended appreciation or critique by connoisseurs, art patrons, collectors and critics.\nThe audience that comes to participate in or experience the beauty and the world of art. This audience may consist of collectors with an intent to acquire, art connoisseurs, patrons or those that are there simply for the experience. An exhibition becomes a resource for many that are related to the business aspect of art. And for others it becomes a pure indulgence to soak in the artistic wonders that an exhibition offers.\nThe venue for any exhibition is central to the content of the exhibition. A private gallery that has the intent to sell the pieces that are on display, designs the event in such fashion as would encourage the business of art. A museum or a vanity gallery builds up an intellectually charged environment for the patrons and enthusiasts to soak their senses in. However, when the exhibition is at an unusual venue that has little or nothing to do with art, it mostly has a very symbiotic and aesthetic relationship with the pieces.\nThe exhibitions usually have a love-hate relationship with the society. In cases where the exhibits conform to the society, mostly there is almost a unanimous appreciation for it and the acceptance is whole hearted and overwhelming. However, depending on the degree of non-conformity or controversy that the exhibits ensue, there might be skepticism, careful, superficial or gradual acceptance or there might be a total scandal\nFor an artist to be introduced to the right people in a right way is vital. The opportunity to be spotted by a connoisseur, a patron, a collector or the right private gallery is extended through an intelligently designed exhibition. An exhibition helps build an instant connection between the artworks and the enthusiasts or businessmen in the field of art.\nHowever, it is not just an opportunity for the artist. It also has a great deal of advantage for the other end of the spectrum, the buyers and art enthusiasts in any capacity. They find their interests being entertained and well taken care of with focus and intent in these exhibitions.\nThe society in general has a definite advantage as an exhibition brings in a cultural refreshment to the population. In absence of such exhibitions a large chunk of the society is deprived of a cultural capital they could all have gained from. Each exhibit in itself carries a lot of information and philosophy, which is then interpreted and analyzed by the audience.']	['<urn:uuid:f19da7c2-37ec-4bb0-94ed-15c9147b1553>', '<urn:uuid:0e8448d1-df51-46dc-b161-27e1d9643d21>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	11	90	2094
6	Are music teachers and bass teachers facing similar teaching challenges?	Yes, both face similar challenges in teaching fundamentals to their students. Music educators deal with students who need musical basics - being tuneful, beatful, and artful - especially before age 5 when 90% of brain development occurs. Similarly, bass teachers face challenges with students who often start later than other musicians, have less experience, and need to learn basic fingering systems. Both types of teachers must adapt their teaching to students' developmental stages and physical capabilities.	['Last Updated on\nTMEA First General Session\nI have been waiting weeks for this session that featured the keynote speakers of Steven Sharp Nelson and Jon Schmidt of The Piano Guys, joined by NASA Astronaut Douglas Wheelock. The session began with The Piano Guys performing, which puts you in a happy mood, if you were not already in one.\nThen, Jon spoke to the importance of music education and how we, music educators, have the amazing ability to teach hope. With more people talking about despair and less talking about hope, music educators are hope. They show it and teach it every day. He then listed and thanked, from memory, every music teacher that taught him.\nSteven spoke about how he began studying piano. His sister just started teaching him. He then practiced to get better. By middle school, that awkward age, he realized that playing piano made him the center of attention in a great way.\nAstronaut Douglas Wheelock joined them on stage. I love that he incorporated the STEAM philosophy into his talk. However, he mostly focused around the profound effect his music teacher had on him when he was young. He reflected on how his music teacher, Christine West, encouraged him to do anything. To live his dreams. To never hold back. He reminded us to teach with passion. When you teach with passion, everyone will listen and take notice.\nDoug, Jon, and Steven ended with a beautiful poem put to music. Doug read a poem that he wrote to honor his late father. He related one of his favorite memories of how he and his father planted a tree in their yard, how that tree had grown over the years, and the effect that had on his life.\nApplying 21st Century Skills in the Music Room\nI always enjoy watching 2014 TI:ME Teacher of the Year, Catie Dwinal, present, so I attended a portion of her session (I am always trying to attend multiple sessions at once). Catie presented on how you can use music and movement, creativity, composing, and improvising music as ways to apply 21st century skills in the music room. Catie, a former elementary music teacher, now works for Quaver Music and knows their program like the back of her hand. It was great to see Catie relate the program to these skills and to answer specific questions about the program.\nIt was so wonderful to attend this session presented by my good friend and fellow NJ music educator, Dr. Missy Strong. Missy spoke to neuroscience and music education in the First Steps Certification Course that she taught last summer ((based on the First Steps programs written by Dr. John Feierabend, published by GIA). I loved going to this session to learn more about this topic.\nMissy began with the buzz words of neuroscience and education. Many schools are focusing on Mind Brain Education (MBE) and other types of buzz words. This means to us as music educators, that by learning more about how the brain works, we understand the learning process better.\nThe Brain Myths\nIt is good for me to realize the following: There are myths about the brain.\n- Myth: “left-” and “right-brain”. Fact: We know that both hemispheres are firing at the same time and working together.\n- Myth: We only use 10% of our brain capacity. Fact: In healthy brain functioning, 100% of brain activity is used at all times.\n- Myth: Everyone has a favored “learning style”. Fact: These theories popularized in the 1970s have been extensively debunked because students do not only learn in one way.\n- Myth: Music increases reasoning ability, ie the “Mozart Effect”. Fact: This is an example of the widespread impact of wrong thinking.\n- How do we counteract these myths? Let the brain experts do the research and the statistics. We, as music educators, need to be the savvy consumer of research and know some brain basics.\nMissy’s presentation focuses on a child’s brain development from the ages of 0-9. She explained the different parts of the brain and their purposes. She spoke about neurons and why we need to care about them. Neurons carry information and they never touch. Neurons are connected to other neurons by tiny gaps called synapses. A baby is born with every neuron that they will have for the rest of their lives. I believe that she said a billion neurons each with 2500 synaptic connections. By age three, it is 15,000 synaptic connections per neuron.\nWhat this means in basic terms, is every time you communicate with a child, you are quite literally shaping their brain. You have a great impact on your students. 90% of a child’s brain development happens before age five. This does not mean that children and adults cannot learn. It means that the brain is developing and you can do so much good with your students. It also means that you can do so much bad as well.\nBoth hemispheres possess neural networks for music processing. There are things that only light up for music and not for language. They overlap, but they are not intrinsically tied. There are physical and processing differences between the brains of musicians and non-musicians.\nEach child is a mold of clay that you can shape musically. The best time to sculpt it is right away. This is why I have Mommy/Caregiver and Me Music Classes once a month at my school. Learning about the brain from Missy has made me aware of how I can musically shape these molds of clay in a positive way.\nOnce a child reaches the ages of seven to nine, the clay is now a vessel. It could be something as small as an ash tray to a large vase. The middle school music teachers are now filling this vessel that you have given them. If it is an ash tray, then all that the middle school music educators teach the child will overflow and be overwhelming. If it is a vase, then the child will hold and nurture all of that musical information.\nThree-Part Approach to Formalized Elementary Music Education\nIf your children come to you in early elementary with no musical background, then it is your job to pick up the musical slack. We have to teach them to be tuneful (they are able to sing Happy Birthday in tune when they are adults), beatful (they can move to the beat and feel meter), and artful (they feel connected to their child when singing to them). Every lesson should have three-parts: notational literacy, something about music (like “this is Beethoven…”), and should be “doing music”. One of the challenges that music educators experience is that they fall into a lesson that the majority is “something about music.” For example, a unit on dynamics. Of course we should teach dynamics in music. However, to look at that unit and to incorporate it into more of “doing music” and teaching the dynamics within that part.\nFrom middle school and beyond, assume your students are musical. If not, work towards age-appropriate “doing music” activities. If they are musical, fill their vessel and give them plenty of opportunities to create, perform, respond, and connect to music.\nBringing Your Classroom to Your Parents Mobile Devices\nThis session was to be given by my good friend Cherie Herring and me. However, Cherie could not make it, but I am so glad that she could share her experiences with Seesaw so that I could include her materials and she could present “in spirit”.\nIt was a packed session where I showcased students’ works and how they can be shared with their parents and caregivers. Seesaw has been a game changer in our classrooms. Parents now know our curriculum as well as our performances. They are seeing our students’ musical challenges, progress, and accomplishments. As a parent of two children using Seesaw, I have seen my girls learn to read at school. I am able to start conversations at home from what they did in school that day. Seesaw has also given my shiest students a voice. In addition, it has given my students who need more challenges, a way to feel challenged and to show me their individual accomplishments.\nMy handout and free webinars on how to integrate Seesaw into the elementary music classroom can be found on my website, amymburns.com.\nI am looking forward to Day 2 of TMEA!\nAmy M.

The piano, drum, and guitar parts are usually just bare bones writing. At least the bass part has notes, so it must be okay . . . right?\nUnfortunately, the answer to that question is a resounding NO. The bass part looks appropriate, but it’s not. Most parts are written with no knowledge of fingerings, fingerboards, or even string changes.\nThink about your bassist for a minute. Usually the bassist has started the instrument more recently than the winds, so they have much less experience. Most have switched from another instrument, and some have even switched from another clef. This is true even in high school groups. This means that, while your winds know two octave scales in most keys, the bassist is often still dealing with what note is where. Let’s also add in that there are two instruments (upright and electric) and two fingering systems, and things get complicated.\nAll upright bassists use fingers 1, 2, and 4 (with 3 pairing with 4). Electric bassists with large hands can use one finger per fret. What about electric bassists with smaller hands, though? Those electric bassists should use the upright bass fingering system. This is something that many band teachers do not realize.\nMany beginning band method books use the wrong fingering system because the part was edited by a grown up with big hands. When the stretch is too far, students will adjust on their own—and not in a good way. They will play using only one or two fingers and needlessly move all around the fingerboard.\nHow do we teach bass students, then, when the parts are inappropriate in so many ways? This session at NAfME’s 2017 In-Service Conference will cover:\n- both fingering systems and how to tell which one to teach\n- editing actual jazz band bass parts\n- chord patterns that lie under the left hand (using both fingerings)\n- ornaments that advanced bassists use to spice up a quarter note line\nAbout the author:\nNAfME member Megan Cleary is a bassist and teacher in North Central Washington state. Her bass teachers were Bert Turetzky, Fred Tinsley, Carolyn Davis Fryer, and Barry Lieberman. She has her MM in double bass performance from Rutgers University.

7	What methods are computer scientists developing to handle both code compilation and network security in next-generation systems?	For code compilation, computer scientists are developing multi-step approaches that involve: creating abstract syntax trees to represent code structure, converting this into intermediate three-address code, and finally generating assembly code for execution. For network security, researchers are developing two main approaches to counter quantum computing threats: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), which uses quantum physics principles to detect eavesdropping when sharing secret keys, and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), which uses mathematical problems that are difficult even for quantum computers to solve. Both compilation and security systems are being designed with formal verification capabilities to mathematically guarantee their reliability and allow for testing from the outside.	['Your goal in this step is to generate code for expressions. To do this, we will build semantic actions that generate code in an intermediate representation (IR) for assignment statements and expressions, and then translate that intermediate representation to assembly code.\nWe recommend that you do this in three steps, as it will make it easier to debug your code, but you can also choose to do it in two steps (step 1 is optional):\n- Generate an abstract syntax tree (AST) for the code in your function.\n- Convert the AST into a sequence of IR Nodes that implement your function using three address code.\n- Traverse your sequence of IR Nodes to generate assembly code.\nWe will discuss each of these steps next. You may also find the Lecture 4 notes helpful.\n(Note: in this step, and step 5, we will only have one function in our program,\nAbstract Syntax Tree\nAn Abstract Syntax Tree is essentially a cleaned up form of your parse tree that more straightforwardly captures the structure of expressions, control constructs, etc. in your program. For many compilers, the AST is the intermediate representation, though we will further convert the AST into another intermediate representation.\nWhat is the difference between a parse tree and an AST ?\nParse trees capture all of the little details necessary to implement your grammar. This means that it often contains extraneous information beyond what is necessary to capture the details of a piece of code (e.g., there are nodes for tokens like “;”, and nodes for all of the sub-constructs we used to correctly implement order of operations). ASTs, in contrast, contain exactly the information needed to capture the meaning of an expression, including being structured to preserve order of operations.\nFor example, consider the parse tree for\na + b * c:\nComplicated, huh? Here’s an abstract syntax tree that captures the same thing:\nMuch simpler! We aren’t preserving anything except the bare minimum needed to describe the expression (note that we included the type of each of the variables in the program – we can get that information from our symbol table!).\nBuilding an AST\nNote that the information in the AST is associated with various nodes in the parse tree. We can use semantic actions, just as we did in Step 3, to pass information “up” the parse tree to build up the AST. Instead of passing information about a declaration, we can instead pass partially constructed abstract syntax tree nodes (you may want to define a class or structure called\nASTNode that can be the “return type” for the relevant constructs). For example:\nadd_op: generate an\nAddExprAST node that has two children (that you leave uninitialized) and keeps track of the operator (\nexpr_prefix: this will have three AST Nodes passed up from its sub rules: one from\nexpr_prefix(which may be NULL, but otherwise will be an\nAddExprnode missing its right child), one passed up from\nfactor(which will be a complete AST Node with all its fields filled in), and one passed up from\nadd_op(which will be an\nAddExprnode that has neither its left nor its right child filled in).\nexpr_prefixis NULL, make the\nadd_opnode’s left child the node from\nfactorand return up the\nadd_opnode (note that it won’t have its right child filled in!)\nexpr_prefixisn’t NULL, note that it will be missing its right child. Make the\nfactornode its right child, then make the\nadd_opnode’s left child, which you pass up.\nThis basic idea: creating AST nodes when you have the information for a new node, then filling in various fields of the node as you work your way up the parse tree, will let you eventually create an AST for all the statements in the function.\nHint: you should also create an AST node to capture lists of statements; each element of the list will point to an AST node for a single\nIR: 3 Address Code\nThe next step in our compilation process is to generate 3 Address Code (3AC), which is our intermediate representation. 3AC is an intermediate representation where each instruction has at most two source operands and one destination operand. Unlike assembly code, 3AC does not have any notion of registers. Instead, the key to 3AC is to generate temporaries – variables that are used to hold the intermediate results of computations. For example, the 3AC for\nd := a + b * c (where all variables are integers) will be:\nMULTI b c $T1 ADDI a $T1 $T2 STOREI $T2 d\nGenerating 3AC is straightforward from an AST. We can perform a post-order walk of the tree, passing up increasingly longer sequences of IR code called\nCodeObjects. Each code object retains three pieces of information:\n- A sequence of IR Nodes (a structure representing a single 3AC instruction) that holds the code for this part of the AST (i.e., that implements this part of the expression)\n- An indication of where the “result” of the IR code is being stored (think: the name of the temporary or variable where the result of the expression is stored)\n- An indication of the type of the result (INT or FLOAT)\nThen, when we encounter something like an\nAddExpr Node, we can generate code for the overall expression as follows:\n- Create a new\nCodeObjectwhose code list is all the code from the left child of the\nAddExprfollowed by all the code for the right child.\n- Use the\nresultfields of the left and right\nCodeObjects to create a new 3AC instruction performing the add, storing the result in a new temporary. Add this new instruction to the end of your code list\n- Indicate in your\nCodeObjectthe temporary where the result is stored, and its type.\n- Return the new\nCodeObjectup the AST as part of your post-order walk.\nCodeObjectfor a simple variable won’t have any 3AC code associated with it. Instead, mark the variable itself as the “temporary” the result is stored in.\nHint: You may find it useful to write a helper function to generate “fresh” temporaries.\nThen, when you get to the top of the AST, you will have a single\nCodeObject that contains all of the IR code for the entire\nNote: We are generating code by performing a post-order walk of the AST. You can also generate code using this strategy by performing a post-order walk of the parse-tree (which is why you can optionally skip building the AST).\nHere are the 3AC instructions you should use:\nADDI OP1 OP2 RESULT (Integer add; RESULT = OP1 + OP2) SUBI OP1 OP2 RESULT (Integer sub; RESULT = OP1 - OP2) MULI OP1 OP2 RESULT (Integer mul; RESULT = OP1 * OP2) DIVI OP1 OP2 RESULT (Integer div; RESULT = OP1 / OP2) ADDF OP1 OP2 RESULT (Floating point add; RESULT = OP1 + OP2) SUBF OP1 OP2 RESULT (Floating point sub; RESULT = OP1 - OP2) MULF OP1 OP2 RESULT (Floating point mul; RESULT = OP1 * OP2) DIVF OP1 OP2 RESULT (Floating point div; RESULT = OP1 / OP2) STOREI OP1 RESULT (Integer store; store OP1 in RESULT) STOREF OP1 RESULT (Floating point store; store OP1 in RESULT) READI RESULT (Read integer from console; store in RESULT) READF RESULT (Read float from console; store in RESULT) WRITEI OP1 (Write integer OP1 to console) WRITEF OP1 (Write float OP1 to console) WRITES OP1 (Write string OP1 to console)\nOnce you have your IR, your final task is to generate assembly code. In this class, we will be using an assembly instruction set called Tiny. See the Tiny documentation for details about the instruction set.\nThis step is fairly straightforward: iterate over the list of 3AC you generated in the previous step and convert each individual instruction into the necessary Tiny code (note that Tiny instructions reuse one of the source operands as the destination, so you may need to generate multiple Tiny instructions for each 3AC instruction).\nFor now, we will be using a version of Tiny that supports 200 registers, so you can more or less directly translate each temporary you generate into a register.\nTesting your Tiny code\nYou can test your Tiny code by running it on our Tiny simulator. This simulator can be built by running:\n> g++ -o tiny tinyNew.cpp\nYou can then run a program with tiny commands using:\n> ./tiny <code file>\nWhat you need to do\nIn this step, you will be generating assembly code for assignment statements, expressions, and READ and WRITE commands. Use the steps outlined above to generate Tiny code. Your compiler should output a list of tiny code that we will then run through the Tiny simulator to make sure you generated the right result.\nFor debugging purposes, it may also be helpful to emit your list of IR code. You can precede a statement with a\n; to turn it into a comment that our simulator will not interpret.\nAll the inputs we will give you in this step will be valid programs. We will also ensure that all expressions are type safe: a given expression will operate on either INTs or FLOATs, but not a mix, and all assignment statements will assign INT results to variables that are declared as INTs (and respectively for FLOATs).\nSample inputs and outputs\nThe inputs and outputs we will test your program can be found here.\nIn this step, we will only grade your compiler on the correctness of the generated code. We will run your generated code through the Tiny simulator and check to make sure that you produce the same result as our code. When we say result, we mean the outputs of any WRITE statements in the program (not details such as how many cycles the code uses, how many registers, etc.)\nWe will not check to see if you generate exactly the same code that we do – no need to diff anything. We only care if your generated code works correctly. You may generate slightly different code than we did.\nFor full credit on this assignment, your generated code merely needs to work properly. We will not consider how fast your code runs. However, we will also evaluate how fast your Tiny code runs (the “Total Cycles” reported by the Tiny simulator).\nThe groups whose generated Tiny code runs fastest (averaging across all the inputs) will receive bonus points for this step: 15% for the fastest code, 10% for second, and 5% for third.\nWhat you need to submit\nAll of the necessary code for your compiler that you wrote yourself. You do not need to include the ANTLR jar files if you are using ANTLR.\nA Makefile with the following targets:\ncompiler: this target will build your compiler\nclean: this target will remove any intermediate files that were created to build the compiler\nteam: this target will print the same team information that you printed in step 0.\nA shell script (this must be written in bash, which is located at\n/bin/bashon the ecegrid machines) called\nrunmethat runs your scanner. This script should take in two arguments: first, the input file to the scanner and second, the filename where you want to put the scanner’s output. You can assume that we will have run\nmake compilerbefore running this script.\nWhile you may create as many other directories as you would like to organize your code or any intermediate products of the compilation process, both your\nMakefile and your\nrunme script should be in the root directory of your repository.\nDo not submit any binaries. Your git repo should only contain source files; no products of compilation or test cases. If you have a folder named\ntest in your repo, it will be deleted as part of running our test script (though the deletion won’t get pushed) – make sure no code necessary for building/running your compiler is in such a directory.\nYou should tag your step 4 submission as', 'Feature Articles: Research and Development of Security in the IOWN Era\nVol. 20, No. 1, pp. 32–39, Jan. 2022. https://doi.org/10.53829/ntr202201fa6\nSecure Optical Transport Network\nThe implementation of an optical transport network, especially between datacenters, has been progressing. Similar to the Internet, communications on the optical transport network are protected by public-key cryptography and symmetric-key cryptography, but there are concerns that advances in the research and development of quantum computers will pose a risk to current cryptographic systems, public-key cryptography and key exchange in particular. In response to this problem, researchers at NTT Social Informatics Laboratories and NTT Network Innovation Laboratories are engaged in the research and development of safe key-exchange schemes to counter the cryptographic risks posed by quantum computers. They are also engaged in architecture design and tests with actual equipment with the aim of applying such key-exchange schemes to the optical transport network.\nKeywords: optical transport network, quantum key distribution, post-quantum cryptography\n1.1 What does “transport” mean?\n“Transport” is often defined as “carrying” (as in physical distribution) or “transmission” (as in communications). In other words, it generally refers to corporate distribution and transport services and to communication and transmission services. To make it easy to imagine the features of a secure optical transport network as a technology affixed with the label “transport,” we begin our discussion using distribution and transport services as an example (Fig. 1).\nWhat are the features of distribution and transport services by truck? Various images may come to mind, such as the carrying of many goods at one time and the prompt delivery of goods after orders are placed. We take up such features from the five viewpoints listed in Table 1.\nFirst, in distribution and transport services, large capacity and low delay are features that are most important to customers and that give value to these services. Large capacity means a large number of trucks and low delay means short truck queuing time. From the viewpoint of running a distribution and transport business, efficient operations are essential, which can be expressed as the optimization of distribution and the economical management of daily operations. Many questions are now being asked about the social impact of services, so concerns about environmental load and safety have also become service features. Environmental load means low levels of exhaust gas/carbon dioxide (CO2) and safety means correct delivery of goods and few traffic accidents.\nWhat do these features mean in communication and transmission services? Large capacity and low delay are also the features that are the most important to customers and that give value to these services. Using terms from the field of communications, large capacity means high throughput and low delay means low latency. From the viewpoint of running a communication and transmission enterprise, efficient operations are likewise essential, which can be expressed as network efficiency in providing communication and transmission services. Finally, it is also true in the communications industry that the social impact of services has come under the spotlight, so environmental load and safety have also become of concern. In this industry, environmental load means low power consumption and safety means few network failures and a high level of security.\nAmong the five viewpoints listed in Table 1, the Innovative Optical and Wireless Network (IOWN) and All-Photonics Network (APN) under research and development at NTT aim for services that take into account the three points of large capacity, low delay, and low environmental load that appeal most to customers . The first step in adding the viewpoint of “safety = security” to IOWN/APN is the secure optical transport network proposed in this article.\n1.2 Necessity of an optical transport network\nMany people have come to appreciate how their lives have become more convenient thanks to the proliferation of mobile phones and smartphones and the expansion of the large-capacity and low-latency fifth-generation mobile communications system (5G). Large capacity and low latency are also desirable features in communication and transmission services targeting corporate customers. Customer needs have come to focus on datacenter interconnect services envisioning the need for datacenter disaster recovery as well as on uncompressed video transmission services for remote production to enable simultaneous and parallel work between a video production site in the field and an editing site. Transmitting such large-capacity data with low latency in real time to the extent possible requires the application of optical transport . This article introduces our efforts in adding security to optical transport.\n2. Current technologies\n2.1 Internet standards\nTo add security to communication and transmission services, we can expect the application of current technologies used on the Internet to be effective and to mature in terms of evaluating security the longer they stay in use.\nOn the Internet, Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) and Security Architecture for Internet Protocol (IPsec) are typical protocols used for configuring safe communication paths (secure channels). SSL/TLS is a standard protocol for configuring a secure channel between a web server and client. IPsec is a standard protocol for configuring secure channels between sites such as between a company’s main office and its branch offices. It is a technology used in virtual private network services. The secure optical transport network introduced in this article is a communication and transmission service operating between sites.\nIPsec for configuring a secure channel between sites is specified by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an organization that formulates de facto Internet standards. The IPsec specifications are organized into architecture, encryption, authentication, and key exchange .\nIPsec’s architecture features the following mechanisms: Internet key exchange (IKE) that exchanges keys, encapsulated security payload (ESP) that performs encryption and authentication, authentication header (AH) that performs authentication, and security association database (SAD) that conveys the keys agreed upon in IKE via ESP or AH (Fig. 2). “Authentication” includes message authentication and entity authentication, which test the validity of a message delivered from a communication destination and that of the communication destination, respectively.\nNext, we discuss how this IPsec configuration might change in a secure optical transport network.\n3. Issues and proposals (I): Possibility of advances in quantum computers\n3.1 Possibility of advances in quantum computers\nCurrent communications on the Internet and other networks use key exchange based on public-key cryptography, which uses a problem that is difficult to solve mathematically as a basis for ensuring security. For example, the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) cryptosystem uses the fact that factoring the product of two large prime numbers takes an extremely long amount of time as a basis for security. However, if a genuine quantum computer having error resilience could be achieved, factoring the product of two large prime numbers could be performed in a relatively short time. If so, the RSA cryptosystem could no longer be called secure. To solve this problem, we have been researching and developing a key-exchange scheme that cannot be broken by a quantum computer.\n3.2 Quantum key distribution\nQuantum key distribution (QKD) is a mechanism for distributing keys by quantum physics. It shares information on a secret key via quantum states on a quantum channel that can transmit quantum states. The most outstanding feature of QKD is the ability to detect eavesdropping by a third party when sharing the secret key. This originates in a property unique to quantum mechanics that measuring a quantum state changes the state. If a third party is attempting to eavesdrop, that is, to carry out measurements while two parties are sending and receiving a quantum state, the sent quantum state and received quantum state will differ. Consequently, if the two parties should then check with each other on their sent and received states and find that they differ, they would be able to detect that a third party is eavesdropping. Performing this process of sending/receiving quantum states and checking for eavesdropping repeatedly increases accuracy and eventually enables the two parties to share a secret key.\n3.3 Post-quantum cryptography-based key distribution\nPost-quantum cryptography (PQC) is a public-key-cryptography and key-distribution mechanism in which problems that are mathematically difficult to solve provide a basis for security. In particular, problems that are assumed to be difficult even for a quantum computer to solve are used as grounds for security. In lattice-based cryptography, for example, it is assumed that finding the lattice points closest to the origin in a given set of lattice points is a difficult problem to solve even for a quantum computer, thereby providing a basis for security.\nAt NTT, research and development in this area is centered about NTRU, a type of PQC lattice-based cryptography incorporated in technology developed by a team including NTT (Fig. 3).\nWe generically refer to QKD and PQC-based key distribution (PQKD) as xKD.\n4. Issues and proposals (II): Countermeasures against new attackers in architecture design\n4.1 Countermeasures against attackers in a zero trust network\nDesigns that envision attackers in a zero trust network, which, as the name indicates, is a closed network that cannot be trusted  have become widespread. In this architecture design, it is necessary to assume attackers on all types of networks including telecommunications carrier networks and intra-site networks. In a telecommunications carrier network, it is assumed that an attacker will be intercepting communications by physically connecting to optical fiber, while in an intra-site network, it is assumed that an attacker intercepting communications has access rights in that network.\nWe first consider an attacker attempting to intercept communications by physically connecting to optical fiber in a telecommunications carrier network. A defense can be mounted through hop-by-hop encryption such as OTNsec, a protocol that protects Layer 1 (physical layer), and MACsec, a protocol that protects Layer 2 (data link layer). Implementing encryption functions in lower layers in this manner should enable the addition of security without hindering the low-latency feature of IOWN/APN.\nNext, to defend against an attacker who is attempting to intercept communications within an intra-site network while having access rights in that network, architecture design for inter-site communications typified by IPsec must be reviewed from the bottom up. In the secure optical transport network, key exchange equivalent to IPsec/IKE described above will correspond to xKD equipment, and encryption equivalent to ESP/AH in IPsec will correspond to an optical transponder or white-box switch. Given the trend toward a disaggregated architecture described later, it must be assumed that separate devices will perform key exchange and transmission and that the key exchange and encryption functions that were integrated in IPsec will take on a separated configuration (Figs. 4, 5, and 6). As a result, key information corresponding to SA(D) in IPsec will circulate in a network external to the device, which means that new measures must be studied for protecting communications on any type of network assuming a zero trust network. Specifically, it will be necessary to design a secure method for key distribution from xKD equipment to the optical transponder and a secure method for equipment authentication between xKD equipment and the optical transponder. For details on these studies, the reader is asked to consult a previously published paper .\n4.2 Necessity of architecture and equipment that can be tested from the outside\nIn a zero trust network, the ability to test the reliability of architecture, protocol, equipment, etc. from the outside is required. The ability to make updates separately to architecture, protocol, equipment, etc. is also required as a fundamental security measure in anticipation of some type of danger. For architecture design, protocol design, and equipment selection described in this article, we adopted formal verification and the white-box switch as technologies for testing reliability from the outside and making updates separately.\n4.3 Formal verification\nAt the time of protocol design including cryptography, there is a need for testing that can mathematically guarantee security as in maintaining the confidentiality of secret information within a protocol and ensuring the integrity of messages. In this regard, formal verification technology has been used for testing the safety of protocols such as SSL/TLS and IPsec that serve as transport layers and for testing the safety of authentication protocol on the 5G standard. Formal verification is a technology that describes a system and the properties that the system must satisfy in a formal language and that tests whether the system is satisfying those properties on the basis of logical reasoning. In formal verification, there are many components that can be automated by computer, so this technology excels in testing results from the outside including checking for reproducibility and in adaptively retesting in the face of protocol updates. For the secure optical transport network introduced in this article, we designed an IPsec-based protocol that combines xKD equipment with an optical transponder and tested its security using the ProVerif formal verification tool .\n4.4 White-box switch\nTransmission equipment for optical-transport purposes had been provided in a form that integrated optical modules and various functions. In contrast, there is also equipment that adopts technology that enables flexible configuration changes, the addition of new functions, cost reductions, etc. by separating the various functions of the transmission equipment and controlling them by standardized interfaces in a disaggregated architecture. This equipment is called a white-box switch or white-box transponder. In our current research, we have taken a white-box switch and added an xKD client function for obtaining an encryption key from xKD equipment in the software function group in order to set the key and control the encryption function of the hardware function group (Fig. 7). We also added a function for directly inputting an SDI (serial digital interface) signal (video signal) and showed that uncompressed 8K60P video in excess of 40 Gbit/s could be securely transmitted with ultra-low latency using this function. Therefore, we have demonstrated the feasibility of secure optical transport linking xKD equipment and optical transponders.\n5. Toward the future\nIn this article, we introduced a secure optical transport network as an initiative to add security functions to IOWN/APN now being researched and developed at NTT. We also introduced key issues and proposals in relation to this initiative. We consider our efforts to be one step in our ongoing plan to contribute to the provision of safe and secure technologies and services.']	['<urn:uuid:ed54353e-1211-4764-929d-e5cacf3f4b1e>', '<urn:uuid:e1fb8003-b725-4048-851f-e2e5d14cca20>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	17	103	4327
8	What are the main differences between simple and complex reflexes in the human body, and how do they relate to the brachial plexus network?	Simple reflexes (also called monosynaptic reflexes) involve a sensory neuron directly connecting to a motor neuron, resulting in immediate responses like the knee-jerk reflex. Complex reflexes (polysynaptic reflexes) have a longer delay between stimulus and response and can control multiple muscle groups simultaneously through interneurons. The brachial plexus network, which consists of nerves running from C5-T1, plays a crucial role in these reflexes as it provides sensory and motor innervation to the entire upper limb, allowing both simple stretch reflexes and complex withdrawal reflexes to function in the arm and shoulder region.

By: Avi Asraf Roger Yee Santiago Roybal Sasha Buz Valeria Muňoz Vincent Cottrill Nerve Plexuses • Cervical plexus – innervates the muscles of the neck and extends into the thoracic cavity to control the diaphragm. • Brachial plexus – innervates the shoulder girdle and upper limb • Lumbar plexus & Sacral plexus – supply the pelvic girdle and lower limb. ▫ *all designate the lumbosacral plexus. Reflexes • A reflex is an automatic motor response to a specific stimulus. • A reflex response usually removes or opposes the original stimulus. • Reflexes help maintain homeostasis by making rapid adjustments to the functions of organs/ organ systems. • Reflex arcs are an example of negative • feedback. Simple Reflex • The “wiring” of a single reflex is called a reflex arc. Simple Reflex • In the simplest reflex arc, a sensory neuron synapses directly on a motor neuron, which performs information processing function. This is also known as a monosynaptic reflex. • The sensory receptors in the stretch reflex are called muscle spindles. Simple Reflex • Stretch reflexes are important in maintaining normal posture and balance and in making automatic adjustments in muscle tone. • Doctors can use the sensitivity of the stretch reflex to test general conditions of the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, and muscles. • Example: knee jerk reflex Complex Reflexes • Polysyanptic reflexes include a longer delay between stimulus and response. • They can produce more involved responses because the interneurons can control several muscle groups simultaneously. • Withdrawal reflexes move stimulated parts of the body away from a source of stimulation. • The strongest withdrawal reflexes are caused by pain stimuli. • A flexor reflex is a withdrawal reflex affecting the muscles of a limb. Complex Reflexes • When a specific muscle contracts, opposing muscles are stretched. • Contraction of a flexor muscles should trigger in the extensors a stretch reflex that would cause them to contract, opposing the movement that is underway. • Interneurons in the spinal cord prevent such competitions through reciprocal inhibition. Integration and Control of Spinal Reflexes • Although reflexes are automatic, higher centers in the brain influence these response by stimulating or inhibiting the interneurons and motor neurons involved. • Stroking the side of an infants sole produces a fanning of toes known as the Babinski sign/positive Babinski reflex. • In adults, the toes curl, which is called Plantar reflex/negative Babinski reflex. Sensory and Motor Pathways Sensory Pathways • A sensation, the information gathered by a sensory receptor, arrives in the form of action potentials in an afferent (sensory) fiber. ▫ Posterior Column Pathway is an example of an ascending sensory pathway. The pathway of messages sent from the brain to the phalanges. Sensory and Motor Pathways Motor Pathways • The corticospinal pathway/pyramidal system provides conscious, voluntary control of skeletal muscles. • The medial and lateral pathways provide subconscious, involuntary control of muscle tone and movements of the neck, trunk, and limbs. ▫ These pathways were known as the extrapyramidal system because it was thought that they operated independently of and parallel to the pyramidal system. ▫ The corticospinal pathway begins at pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex. Quick Review • 1) What is another name for the simplest reflex arc? • 2) Why are stretch reflexes important? • 3) What is the difference between the positive Babinski reflex and the negative Babinski reflex? • 4) What is a sensation? • 5) Where do corticospinal pathways begin?', 'The right brachial plexus with its short branches, viewed from in front.\n|From||C5, C6, C7, C8, T1|\n|Innervates||Sensory and motor innervation to the upper limb|\n|Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy|\nThe brachial plexus is a network of nerves, running from the spine, formed by the anterior rami of the lower four cervical nerves and first thoracic nerve (C5–C8, T1). The brachial plexus passes through the cervicoaxillary canal in the neck, over the first rib, and into the axilla (armpit region), where it innervates the upper limbs and some neck and shoulder muscles.\n- 1 Structure\n- 2 Function\n- 3 Clinical significance\n- 4 Additional images\n- 5 References\n- 6 Bibliography\n- 7 External links\nThe brachial plexus is divided into five roots, three trunks, six divisions, three cords, and five branches. There are five ""terminal"" branches and numerous other ""pre-terminal"" or ""collateral"" branches that leave the plexus at various points along its length. A common structure used to identify part of the brachial plexus in cadaver dissections is the M or W shape made by the musculocutaneous nerve, lateral cord, median nerve, medial cord, and ulnar nerve.\nThe five roots are the five anterior rami of the spinal nerves, after they have given off their segmental supply to the muscles of the neck. The brachial plexus emerges at five different levels; C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1. C5 and C6 merge to establish the upper trunk, C7 continuously forms the middle trunk, and C8 and T1 merge to establish the lower trunk. Prefixed or postfixed formations in some cases involve C4 or T2, respectively. The dorsal scapular nerve comes from level C5 and innervates the rhomboid muscles which retract the scapula. The subclavian nerve originates in both C5 and C6 and innervates the subclavius, a muscle that involves lifting the first ribs during respiration. The long thoracic arise from C5, C6, and C7. This nerve innervates the serratus anterior, which draws the scapula laterally and is the prime mover in all forward-reaching and pushing actions.\nThese roots merge to form three trunks:\nEach trunk then splits in two, to form six divisions:\n- anterior divisions of the upper, middle, and lower trunks\n- posterior divisions of the upper, middle, and lower trunks\n- when observing the body in an anatomical position, the anterior divisions are superficial to the posterior divisions\nThese six divisions regroup to become the three cords or large fiber bundles. The cords are named by their position with respect to the axillary artery.\n- The posterior cord is formed from the three posterior divisions of the trunks (C5-C8,T1)\n- The lateral cord is formed from the anterior divisions of the upper and middle trunks (C5-C7)\n- The medial cord is simply a continuation of the anterior division of the lower trunk (C8,T1)\nThe branches are listed below. Most branch from the cords, but a few branch (indicated in italics) directly from earlier structures. The five on the left are considered ""terminal branches"". There have been several variations reported in the branching pattern but these are very rare.\nBold indicates primary spinal root component of nerve.

The brachial plexus communicates through the sympathetic trunk via gray rami communicantes that join the plexus roots.\nBrachial plexus injury affects cutaneous sensations and movements in the upper limb. They can be caused by stretching, diseases, and wounds to the lateral cervical region (posterior triangle) of the neck or the axilla. Depending on the location of the injury, the signs and symptoms can range from complete paralysis to anesthesia. Testing the patient\'s ability to perform movements and comparing it to their normal side is a method to assess the degree of paralysis. A common brachial plexus injury is from a hard landing where the shoulder widely separates from the neck (such as in the case of motorcycle accidents or falling from a tree). These stretches can cause ruptures to the superior portions of the brachial plexus or avulse the roots from the spinal cord. Upper brachial plexus injuries are frequent in newborns when excessive stretching of the neck occurs during delivery. Studies have shown a relationship between birth weight and brachial plexus injuries; however, the number of cesarean deliveries necessary to prevent a single injury is high at most birth weights. For the upper brachial plexus injuries, paralysis occurs in those muscles supplied by C5 and C6 like the deltoid, biceps, brachialis, and brachioradialis. A loss of sensation in the lateral aspect of the upper limb is also common with such injuries. An inferior brachial plexus injury is far less common, but can occur when a person grasps something to break a fall or a baby\'s upper limb is pulled excessively during delivery. In this case, the short muscles of the hand would be affected and cause the inability to form a full fist position.\nTo differentiate between pre ganglionic and post ganglionic injury, clinical examination requires that the physician keep the following points in mind. Pre ganglionic injuries cause loss of sensation above the level of the clavicle, pain in an otherwise insensate hand, ipsilateral Horner\'s syndrome, and loss of function of muscles supplied by branches arising directly from roots—i.e., long thoracic nerve palsy leading to winging of scapula and elevation of ipsilateral diaphragm due to phrenic nerve palsy.\nAcute brachial plexus neuritis is a neurological disorder that is characterized by the onset of severe pain in the shoulder region. Additionally, the compression of cords can cause pain radiating down the arm, numbness, paresthesia, erythema, and weakness of the hands. This kind of injury is common for people who have prolonged hyperabduction of the arm when they are performing tasks above their head.\nBrachial plexus injuries are injuries that affect the nerves that carry signals from the spine to the shoulder. This can be caused by the shoulder being pushed down and the head being pulled up, which stretches or tears the nerves. Injuries associated with malpositioning commonly affect the brachial plexus nerves, rather than other peripheral nerve groups. Due to the brachial plexus nerves being very sensitive to position, there are very limited ways of preventing such injuries. The most common victims of brachial plexus injuries consist of victims of motor vehicle accidents and newborns.\nMotorcyclists who are involved in accidents are very susceptible to brachial plexus injuries due to the nature of the collision. ""Brachial plexus injuries were identified in 54 of 4538 patients presenting to a regional trauma facility… Motor vehicle accidents were the most frequent cause overall.""\nMany of these patients were forced to undergo reconstructive surgery. During physical therapy, the position of the brachial plexus became very important to avoid further damage. ""The risk can be reduced by thorough release of the tissues from the inferior surface of the clavicle before mobilization of the fracture fragments."" By wearing protective gear, like a helmet, a motorcyclist can help prevent nerve damage after collisions.\nOne sports injury that is becoming prevalent in contact sports, particularly in the sport of American football, is called a ""stinger."" An athlete can incur this injury in a collision that can cause cervical axial compression, flexion, or extension of nerve roots or terminal branches of the brachial plexus. In a study conducted on football players at United States Military Academy, researchers found that the most common mechanism of injury is, ""the compression of the fixed brachial plexus between the shoulder pad and the superior medial scapula when the pad is pushed into the area of Erb\'s point, where the brachial plexus is most superficial."". The result of this is a ""burning"" or ""stinging"" pain that radiates from the region of the neck to the fingertips. Although this injury causes only a temporary sensation, in some cases it can cause chronic symptoms.\nMost penetration wounds require immediate treatment and are not as easy to repair. For example, a laceration by a knife to the brachial plexus could damage and/or cut the nerve. According to where the cut was made, it could inhibit action potentials needed to innervate that nerve\'s specific muscle or muscles.\nInjuries during birth\nBrachial Plexus injuries also become an issue during the delivery of newborns. ""…there were 80 brachial plexus injuries identified, for an incidence of 1–3 per 1000 live birth."" Nerve damage has been connected to birth weight with larger newborns being more susceptible to the injury but it also has to do with the delivery methods. Although very hard to prevent during live birth, doctors must be able to deliver a newborn with precise and gentle movements to decrease chances of injuring the child.\nImaging of the Brachial Plexus can be done effectively by using a higher magnetic strength MRI Scanner like 1.5 T or more. It is impossible to evaluate the brachial plexuses with plain Xray, CT and ultrasound scanning can manage to view the plexuses to an extent; hence MRI is preferred in imaging brachial plexus over other imaging modalities due to its multiplanar capability and the tissue contrast difference between brachial plexus and adjacent vessels. The plexuses are best imaged in coronal and sagittal planes, but axial images give an idea about the nerve roots. Generally, T1 WI and T2 WI images are used in various planes for the imaging; but new sequences like MR Myelolography, Fiesta 3D and T2 cube are also used in addition to the basic sequences to gather more information to evaluate the anatomy more.\n- Goel, Shivi; Rustagi, SM; Kumar, A; Mehta, V; Suri, RK (Mar 13, 2014).

9	what happens sardes city under gyges	During Gyges' reign in the second quarter of the seventh century BCE, Sardes developed into an impressive city. Archaeological evidence shows that proper houses with roof tiles were constructed during this period. The city's prosperity was aided by the presence of gold and silver in the nearby river Pactolus. However, in 644 BCE, the lower town of Sardes was captured during a Cimmerian invasion led by Lygdamis.	"['Gyges: first king of the Mermnad dynasty. His reign lasted from ca.680 to 644.\nIn the first decade of the seventh century BCE, the old kingdom of Phrygia was overthrown by a nomadic tribe that was called Cimmerians. The famous king Midas had once been able to repel them, but in 696/695, there was no such help. After a lost battle, Midas appears to have committed suicide. His capital Gordium was destroyed, and the central government collapsed. Military leaders who were able to offer protection to a region started to create small kingdoms of their own.\nOne of them was a man named Gyges, the founding father of Lydia. Hardly anything is known about his rise to power, which became the stuff that tall stories are made of. The Greek researcher Herodotus of Halicarnassus, who wrote two centuries after the death of Gyges, tells in the first book of Histories that Lydia was once ruled by a man named Candaules or Myrsilus, and that his wife ordered Gyges to kill the king. (Candaules\' real name was Sadyattes.) One century later, the philosopher Plato invented a fantastic tale about Gyges\' ring, which made him invisible and allowed him to seize power. An even later author, Plutarch of Chaeronea, informs us that a Carian prince named Arselis of Mylasa helped Gyges. This is, at least, not an unbelievable story, and is to a certain extent confirmed by the close ties that existed between Lydia and Caria.\nThe new king of Lydia had nothing to fear from the east, where he defeated the Cimmerians in 679. Now, Gyges could embark upon a western policy, where several Greek towns were situated on the eastern shore of the Aegean Sea. In vain, Gyges attacked Miletus and Smyrna, but he was able to capture Colophon, which gave Lydia its first port. The Troad seems to have been subdued as well. For a century, its capital Adramyttium was to be the Lydian\'s crown prince\'s apanage.\nFrom now on, Lydia and Greece had contact. Gyges initiated the policy that was to continue for more than a century: while attacking the Greek towns in Asia, he gave lavish presents to the sanctuaries at the mainland:\nHe sent a number of presents to the shrine at Delphi; indeed, most of the silver there came from him, and in addition he presented a vast number of vessels of gold of various kinds, the most noteworthy being six golden mixing bowls. [Herodotus, Histories 1.14; tr. Aubrey de Selincourt]\nThe result was that the god of the oracle discouraged the Greek towns in the mother country to support the Asian Greeks. It was one of Gyges\' many political uses of gold and silver, which was conveniently found in the river Pactolus near Sardes. Archaeologists have shown that during the second quarter of the seventh century, i.e. during the reign of Gyges, Sardes became an impressive city with real houses, covered with roof tiles. (Herodotus\' remark that they were made of reed and had thatched roofs is certainly wrong.)\nSo, Gyges\' reign started successfully. Assyrian sources indicate that he was also responsible for a treaty with the new pharaoh of Egypt, Psammetichus I (664-610). It is certain, however, that Greek and Carian mercenaries supported Psammetichus when he became king and expelled the Assyrian garrison.\nThe strongest argument against an Lydo-Egyptian treaty is that Gyges needed Assyria and could not afford to support one of its enemies. A generation after the Cimmerians had destroyed Gordium, they returned. Gyges was now forced to appeal to king Aššurbanipal (668-631) for help. The Assyrian ruler says:\nGyges\' rider set out [...]. He reached the border of my country. My men spotted him and asked him: ""Who are you, stranger, you, whose country\'s rider never traveled the road to the frontier?"" They brought him [...] to Nineveh, my royal city, into my presence. But of all the languages of east and west, over which the god Aššur has given me control, there was no interpreter of his tongue. His language was foreign, so that his words were not understood.note[From M. Cogan & H. Tadmor, ""Gyges and Ashurbanipal: a study in literary transmission"", in: Orientalia 46 (1977), p. 68.]\nIn spite of these linguistic difficulties, a treaty was concluded and after Gyges had paid tribute, the Assyrians and Lydians jointly fought against the Cimmerian mounted archers. On one occasion, Gyges sent prisoners of war to Aššurbanipal.\nIn 644, however, things went seriously wrong. A Cimmerian army, commanded by a man named Lygdamis (Dugdammê), defeated the Lydian army, captured the lower town of Sardes, and continued to the west, where he looted the Greek towns. Gyges was killed. When Lygdamis returned to the east, he was defeated by the Assyrians.\nAlthough the Cimmerian invasion had been bloody and destructive, Gyges\' kingdom survived. His son Ardys succeeded him, and the founder of the Lydian monarchy was buried on the plain of Sardes at the Lydian royal cemetery at Bin Tepe.\nThis is about everything we know about Gyges. In fact, we do not even know his name, because Gyges may be a rendering of the Luwian word hûha, \'grandfather\', which looks like a title. Several biblical scholars have argued that Gyges is behind the figure of Gog, ruler of Magog, who is mentioned by Ezekiel and in the Book of Revelation. At least one Greek tragedy was called Gyges. According to the Roman author Pliny the Elder, Gyges invented all ball games.']"	['<urn:uuid:cfd057b6-3515-4d79-b747-677f1828a65f>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	6	67	910
10	I'm interested in modern transportation technology - what kind of advanced computer tools are used to design these vehicles nowadays?	For the cruise missile, MissileDatcom07 was used to calculate aerodynamic coefficients, while the Elba tanker's design utilized Finite Element Method (FEM) for structural calculations, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools for hull optimization, and 3D modeling for the entire ship including outfitting and production documentation.	"['|M.Sc Student||Peker Avi|\n|Subject||Feasibility Study of a Medium/Long Range Ramjet Cruise|\n|Department||Department of Aerospace Engineering||Supervisors||Professor Benveniste Natan|\n|Professor Rimon Arieli|\n|Full Thesis text - in Hebrew|\nMost cruise missiles operate at cruising altitudes that are two orders of magnitude lower than those of long-range ballistic missiles. This feature is one of the main reasons for the high interest in developing new systems that travel at high speeds and low altitudes, thus increasing detection and interception times for most common interception systems, improving their survivability.\nThe ramjet engine is an air-breathing engine that operates without any moving parts at high Mach numbers. Furthermore, the ramjet engine is known for its high specific impulse, a performance parameter that represents the capable operational range.\nThis research conducts a feasibility study of a cruise missile powered by a ramjet engine. The mission profile chosen is a surface-to-surface mission with a 500 kg payload and a 1500 km operation range.\nThe feasibility question is answered in two parts that are inherently coupled. They combine the external ballistics and flight performance and the internal ballistics (propulsion unit).\nThe first part involves the missile structure and aerodynamic properties, aerodynamic heating and its effect on the design parameters, and a 3DOF trajectory simulation of the missile. The internal ballistics study includes the solid booster and the ramjet engine performance analysis, where thrust, specific impulse and flow mass rates are derived as a function of altitude, flight velocity and time.\nAerodynamic optimization was conducted to satisfy the design criterion that was developed for maximum range. The aerodynamic coefficients were calculated using a component build-up method, MissileDatcom07. Based on the aerodynamic characteristics, estimations of the flight performance were made, such as required hinge moments and missile maneuver accelerations capability.\nThe sizing process was based on empirical correlations derived for similar missiles, in addition to the constraints defined by the specific mission, such as total weight and missile length.\nAn energetic performance analysis was conducted for both the solid rocket booster and the ramjet engine in order to meet the mission requirements. Thermochemical calculations, determined the propellant composition for highest performance. A rod-and-tube propellant grain design was chosen and validated with consideration to erosive burning. The ramjet engine cycle was calculated and a suitable engine configuration was obtained.\nThe aerodynamic heating was taken into account by solving the heat transfer equation for areas on the missile far away from stagnation conditions using lumped analysis assumption and Reynolds analogy. The heat flux and wall temperature of the missile were calculated along the trajectory, in order to determine the thermal protection system or other materials selection. Since the wall temperature exceeds 200 0C, the use of traditional aluminum alloys is not feasible for supersonic flight at low altitudes. Different design approaches within the ""hot"" and ""cold"" structures were reviewed to address the aerodynamic heating challenge.\nFinally, a 3DOF trajectory simulation was carried out and presents the various performance parameters along the missile flight. Moreover, in the trajectory simulation, an applicable ""bending"" law of the trajectory that utilizes thrust vector control and control surfaces steering was tested and implemented successfully, ensuring that all pre-defined mission requirements were kept.', 'Elba is a sophisticated ""Oil Product & Chemical Tanker"" designed and built under Bureau Veritas classification, for worldwide trade, to carry petroleum products, liquid chemical products (IMO II type) and to do bunkering services to other ships. During her design made by Istanbul-based consultancy Delta Marine Co., the optimum point of functionality, safety, economy, environmental approach, maintenance and ergonomics has been targeted. Elba;\n- is a functional ship thanks to her ability to carry petroleum products and more than five hundred (500) chemical products while she can also serve as a bunkering ship;\n- is a green ship thanks to her low fuel consumption, low exhaust emission levels, double skinned cargo and fuel tanks;\n- is an ergonomic ship thanks to less number of cargo tanks when compared with similar ships, her loading & unloading ability both from mid and aft parts, her cargo and machinery automation system controlled from the wheelhouse, her twin rudders, her high maneuvering ability by twin propellers/engines and bow thruster and her wheelhouse giving very wide visibility with lateral sight of 310 degrees and vertical sight by additional ceiling windows;\n- is a ship easy to maintain thanks to its design enabling the main engines and generators to be easily taken out from the ship and sufficient service spaces for each equipment;\n- is a safe ship thanks to its redundant propulsion and maneuvering system.\nDuring basic, detailed and production design stages of the ship, state-of-the-art solutions and latest technological tools have been used for naval architecture calculations, advanced engineering applications and production information preparation. Structural strength calculations have been carried out with Finite Element Method (FEM) and the structural properties of the ship is optimized. Hull form design and optimization is realized by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools. For production purpose a 3D hull and outfitting model of the whole ship has been created and production information and documents have been issued.\nThe ship has nine (9) transverse watertight bulkheads one in aft peak part, one in engine room, one in ballast pump room, four in cargo area, one in bow thruster room and one as collision bulkhead. A longitudinal bulkhead divides all cargo tanks on the centerline. Cargo tank bulkheads are of corrugated type and no structural element faces the inner side of these tanks. The construction of aft and fore part is based on transverse system while the basis of the cargo area construction is longitudinal system. The ship is adequately designed to be an oceangoing ship, sailing in iced sea areas up to 60 cm ice thickness and able to stand cargoes having specific gravity up to 1.54 t/m³ while the cargo tanks are fully or partially loaded. Except the ice belt area A-Grade shipbuilding steel plates have been used for construction while for ice belt area the grade is determined as AH36.\nThe ship contains eight (8) cargo tanks and one (1) slop tank, which in terms of construction, outfitting and coating are designed in accordance with latest MARPOL and IBC rules to carry petroleum products and IMO II type chemical products. Cargo tanks are painted with phenolic epoxy coating. Cargo piping system together with all other pipes and fittings inside the cargo tanks are made of stainless steel (316L). The cargo system of the ship is designed so that simultaneous loading and unloading of 4+1 different substances in mid manifold area and 2 different substances in aft manifold station can be done without mixture. Total unloading capacity is 600 m³/h (110 mlc, 0.8 t/m³). Steam-heated heating coils are located in each cargo tank. Redundancy of the cargo heating system is achieved by using two lines of coil in each tank. Two steam boilers (one spare) are installed for heating purpose. Each cargo tank is equipped with a pump of 150 m³/h capacity, fixed tank cleaning machine, closed electronic and manual level gauging system and temperature and pressure measurement alarm system. In order to load, carry and unload flammable products and to handle operations of two tanks simultaneously a nitrogen system with sufficient capacity is installed.\nThe propulsion system of the ship consists of two four-stroke diesel engines and two fixed-pitch propellers. Elba is classified with Bureau Veritas’ AVM-DPS notation that provides redundancy of the propulsion system enabling the ship continue her course if one of the propulsion systems breaks down. Unmanned engine room control is available thanks to sophisticated automation system. All machinery operations including start/stop of the engines can be carried out from the wheelhouse. The engine room’s design provides sufficient services spaces for all equipment and therefore ergonomics and safety are provided during operations and maintenance in that area.\n- Speed, Fuel Consumption and Cruising Range\nDesign speed of the ship is 12.0 knots and the fuel consumption at this speed is 5.1 t/day. For the same speed value the cruising range is determined as 4500 nautical miles. With only one engine the ship can sail at 9.0 knots.\nThe ship fulfills the requirement of intact and damaged stability criteria in accordance with SOLAS, MARPOL and IBC rules. According to MARPOL damaged stability rules, for all specific gravity values, criteria are met without taking ballast water while in case of IBC damaged stability rules the ballast water should be loaded only for 0.9 t/m³ specific gravity. As a result the CDWT and the DWT values of the ship are the same.\nWhen sailing at design speed the turning diameter of the ship is 2*Lwl and the stopping distance is 4*Lwl.\nTo meet the maneuverability requirements during course the ship is equipped with two independent spade type rudder having high leverage coefficient and working at propeller’s wake. These rudders are controlled by two independent ram type steering gears. Steering gears are controlled from the wheelhouse either independently or in synchronization. In case of low sailing speed and approaching/leaving a port or approaching another ship, a bow thruster is installed at fore part to enhance the ship’s maneuvering ability.\nThe accommodation consists of eleven (11) cabins -two (2) having separate bedroom- all with private lavatory, first aid room, galley, mess room, provision store, laundry, change room and store. Central air conditioning system is installed.\nThe electrical system of the ship is composed of;\n- Three (3) pieces of main diesel generators each of 265 kW capacity and one (1) piece of emergency diesel generator of 99 kW capacity, all producing electricity at 440 V at 60 Hz.\n- One (1) main switchboard that enables manual and automatic synchronization of main diesel generators, providing the ability for automatic load share, stand-by and automatic setting in functions and designs for self-redundancy in case of partial damage\n- One (1) emergency switchboard that works with emergency diesel generator\n- Main and emergency transformers of 220 V all having spares and 24 V DC system.\nThe wheelhouse is designed with simplicity concept, to increase the control and operational efficiency and to do the duties safely.\nFor that purpose the areas for cargo operations, machinery operations are determined in the wheelhouse for expedition and control of specific grouped tasks and latest technology and automation techniques are used at maximum possible level.\nAdditional crew is not needed for cargo or machinery operations since the functions of engine control room and cargo control room are carried into wheelhouse by using automation and tracking technology. Therefore in expedition and control tasks the level of command and safety is increased.']"	['<urn:uuid:8f29a902-09b0-4514-b9b8-d4a1adec7e49>', '<urn:uuid:f6e34f82-d752-4acf-ab64-c7bc44cd45f7>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	20	44	1757

12	effectiveness modern police training mental toughness psychological skills evolution from ancient warfare killing methods	The evolution of training for combat and killing has significantly changed over time. In ancient warfare, most killing occurred when armies fled, as it was psychologically easier to kill someone from behind rather than face-to-face. Modern police training has evolved beyond just physical preparation to include sophisticated psychological skills and mental toughness training. While traditional approaches assumed mental toughness would develop as a side effect of physical training, current evidence shows that explicit psychological skills training is more effective. Programs like the Elite Skills Performance Center integrate physical, psychological, and tactical training to enhance officer performance. This represents a significant advance from historical approaches where killing required psychological distancing through methods like archery or crew-served weapons.	['Have humans always waged war? Is warring an ancient evolutionary adaptation or a relatively recent behaviour? In this book, editor Douglas P. Fry brings together leading experts in evolutionary biology, archaeology, anthropology, and primatology to find answers to fundamental questions about peace, conflict, and human nature in an evolutionary context. Anthony Oruna-Goriaïnoff finds it a comforting thought that our ancestors, at their most primitive, and for a long time after, were happier living in peace and avoided war even though the preconditions for war have been part of humanity from the start.\nWar, Peace, and Human Nature: The Convergence of Evolutionary and Cultural Views. Douglas P. Fry. Oxford University Press. April 2013.\nYou’d be forgiven for thinking that war is as old as human civilization. Certainly that seems to be the view of many scholars and politicians. That war is as old as we are; that, given the latest examples of human behaviour when at war, it will be with us until we are no longer around. Although that second posit is not one which can be entertained here, the first one certainly can be challenged, and forms the focus of War, Peace, and Human Nature, edited by Douglas P. Fry. This hefty and fascinating book presents readers with 27 chapters devoted to challenging the idea that humans have always been attuned to war.\nAnd how best to understand human behaviour than by studying the behaviour of species most closely related to us? In the chapter ‘Chimpanzees, Warfare and the Invention of Peace’, Michael Wilson asks if warfare is an invention or an adaptation, and adds to the dialectic started by Hobbes, who spoke of “Warre” as being the natural state of humans with strong institutions (the “Leviathan”) and Rousseau, who argued that “people were basically peaceful and cooperative”, unless institutions got in the way. Wilson sides with Rousseau, using archaeology, ethnography, as well as animal behaviour, to argue his point. Naturally, our cousins are aggressive and capable of killing their own. But Fry argues that their use of aggressive behaviour is selective, “escalating to damaging fights only when the stakes are high”. The reasons for intraspecific aggression, which seems to be a widespread trait of chimpanzees and not the result of circumstances peculiar to a few study sites, range from territorial defence to availability of resources. Nonetheless, the territorial aspect of the species may play a larger part than has been thought before, since there is now a growing body of evidence supporting the idea that “male chimpanzees seek to defend and expand a feeding territory for themselves, their mates and offspring.”\nSo how is their behaviour co-relatable to that of humans? According to the author, long-term data makes it clear that chimpanzees “regularly live under circumstances that Hobbes would describe as Warre.” He further argues that warlike behaviour in chimpanzees appears to be “adaptive in that participation leads to inclusive fitness benefits.” Their behaviour has been cited as evidence against arguments (Mead, 1940) that warfare is an invention. Nevertheless, according to Wilson, “the special features thought to be needed for humans to become warlike”, such as weapons, agriculture, ideology, states etc are “not present in chimpanzees” and yet they suffer “rates of intergroup killing comparable to human societies with endemic warfare.”\nThe difference the author stresses is that, unlike chimpanzees, human societies see a benefit in cooperation, trade etc. So if we seem to be predisposed to conflict, shouldn’t human history be laden with examples and clear evidence of war?\nAccording to R. Brian Ferguson, author of the chapter ‘The Prehistory of War and Peace in Europe and the Middle East’, instances of war in early human history are rare. Ferguson argues that whenever there is war, it leaves a trace, so to think that war somehow could have occurred and not left a trace, though not impossible, would certainly be rare. Ferguson writes that during the Mesolithic period (about 10,000 to 5000 BCE), evidence of war in Europe is inconsistent, and that in the comparable Epipaleolithic period in the Near East, war is just absent, pointing out the fact that it seems to have been absent in that area for at least half a millennium! So the data appears to support the idea that humans have not been at war from the start. In fact, until a certain point in time, data suggest much the opposite.\nIt is soothing to think that our ancestors, at their most primitive, and for a long time after, were happier living in peace and avoided war (though that is not to say they avoided aggression or violence) even though, as the author points out, the preconditions for war have been part of humanity from the start. That is to say, even though these conditions were there for extended periods of time, there is no evidence of war up until a certain point in time in the case of the southern Levant. And when the signs do appear, they do so very quickly. Towns become fortified in less than 100 years, and signs of war go from 0 to 100% in about the same time period. The author puts this down to the creation of a “tribal zone” in the area, which was a direct cause of the rise of imperial Egypt as the area’s hegemon.\nThis leads Ferguson to ponder the reasons why people who are at peace most of the time would decide to go to war, especially since, as he argues, it would be extremely difficult to get a people who have no history of collective attacks to start doing just that.\nSo, what makes humans so predisposed to kill one another in war? In chapter 25, ‘The Challenge of Getting Men to Kill: A view from military science’, Richard J. Hughbank and Dave Grossman waste no time in pointing out the obvious: we are not suited to kill each other. They base their argument on the need to train the midbrain, “or mammalian brain” to trust in military training, “equipment and fellow warrior” in “the chaos known as combat.” Both authors point out that in ancient warfare, and indeed all the way to the present day, when in battle, most of the killing took place when one army managed to make the other one flee. It is much easier to deny the humanity of a fleeing victim with his back turned since you don’t have to look that person in the eyes. Opposition soldiers turn into prey when they run away, so our brains make the transition from ‘killing’ to ‘hunting’, thus enabling humans to kill their own, argue the authors.\nHughbank and Grossman discuss that the best way to get men to kill is to divide the psychological responsibility of killing by distancing the soldier from it as much as possible. This ‘distance’ enables men to get away from the emotional resistance to killing and it has been achieved by getting archers to be driven from a chariot, by putting men together inside a battleship, or two or more crewmen inside a bomber, or by the use of the crew-served machine gun, which they refer to as “the key killer on the close-range battlefield.” So killing other humans is something which must be taught, since there is a natural animadversion to killing our own, and therein lies much of current military thinking.\nThis book is as fascinating as it is long. The subject matter, as distasteful as it is, is certainly presented in a well thought-out and straightforward manner. If war and peace studies are your target then this book will serve you well. And if they are not, you may be surprised at what you can learn.\nNote: This article gives the views of the author, and not the position of EUROPP – European Politics and Policy, nor of the London School of Economics.\nShortened URL for this post: http://bit.ly/1fMkHH1\nAnthony Oruna-Goriaïnoff is an LSE alumnus, having studied for an MSc in International Relations.

Manning (Ret)\nMajor John Laufer\nMichael J. Asken, Ph.D.\nDarby G. Hand, DO\nPolice training has evolved in many crucial ways. Paper targets have been replaced by mannequins and computerized targets. Rubber knives have been replaced by shock knives, plastic guns by simuntitions, and classroom lecture augmented by reality-based scenario training or RBT (Murray, 2004). One area that had not developed at the same pace, but is now quickly emerging as an important area of training, is that of training officers in the psychological performance skills for what is often termed “mental toughness.”\nTo the point, in a manner that clearly emphasizes the importance of psychological skills training, are the comments of Lt. Col. Dave Grossman:\nIn the end, it is not about the “hardware,” it is about the “software.” Amateurs talk about hardware or equipment, professionals talk about software or training and mental readiness.\nPolice training has traditionally addressed developing mental toughness in officers by rigorous physical expectations and demanding discipline and performance standards. More evolved approaches have used sophisticated reality based (scenario) training to expose officers to stresses that mimic the real world of police work. However, all these approaches rely on the “implicit” or indirect development of mental toughness and psychological performance skills. Mental toughness is assumed to develop as a “side effect” of completing such difficult training.\nThis assumption and the consistent efficacy of such training in developing mental toughness has been questioned. Thompson & McCreary (2006) in discussing the enhancement of mental readiness in military personnel, note that there are several problems with the “implicit” training of psychological skills and simply expecting mental toughness to develop as result of physical training and drills. They state that this approach can\n1.) make mental toughness skills harder to learn\n2.) delay the learning of physical and technical skills themselves because of a lack of mental toughness to master difficult tasks\n3.) undermine operational effectiveness because of sub-optimal mental toughness\n4.) result in a sub-group of individuals who never develop sufficient mental toughness.\nThe explicit and designed training of mental toughness is more likely to be successful.\nAs a result and in response to such concerns, programs such as the Performance Enhancement Program at West Point were developed to directly train mental toughness and elite psychological performance (Zinsser, 2004) and have evolved into what is currently being called “Comprehensive Soldier Fitness (Casey, 2011). For several years now, the police literature, and especially PoliceOne ((Asken, 2007a; 2007b; 2007c; Miller, 2007; Asken, Vonk & Sterling, 2009) has provided articles reflecting the development of the increasing emphasis on directly training police officers in the components of mental toughness and psychological performance skills. The tracking of this evolution shows a reversal of the past status where, too often, despite recognizing the essential need, mental toughness was talked about, but rarely directly trained. Even the current development of conceptualizing and training law enforcement and military personnel as “tactical athletes” (Stephenson, 2007) has been seen as potentially benefitting from integrating mental toughness and psychological performance skills physical conditioning (Asken, Christiansen & Stephenson, 2011).\nThree other recent and continuing developments highlight the importance for such an emphasis in police training. One is the growing body of knowledge about psychological and physical interactions and function in high stress police encounters. The dissemination of this information, and, for example, specialized training leading to certification of expertise in force science, attests to the maturation of this knowledge and skill base (FSRC, 2010).\nNext, while part of the reason for a lack of direct training of mental toughness and psychological performance skills may have the absence of a comprehensive resource and approach, that situation is also changing. An extension of the work cited earlier of the expanding knowledge of performance under stress, is the description and coordination of approaches to minimize these potentially performance degrading effects of stress (Asken, 2005, Miller, 2008, Asken, Grossman, & Christensen, 2010).\nThe final recent and significant development is the empirical demonstration that mental toughness and psychological skill training does indeed impact the quality of tactical performance. Both specific techniques and comprehensive programs have shown positive results in both military and police venues.\nGiven the important potential of systematically integrating physical, psychological, and tactical training — and the emerging evidence that such integration does positively affect police performance — the Pennsylvania State Police and its Academy developed an Elite Skills & Performance Center (ESP Center or ESPC) and program. While integrated psychological and physical training has always been a process and goal at the Academy, the ESPC and program was seen as an advanced cooperative and multi-disciplinary mechanism for Academy and Department instructors, leaders and personnel to have a central resource to collate, develop, promote, disseminate, train and evaluate these integrated concepts and skills.\nThe primary goal and function of the ESPC and program is to serve as a hub to collect and promote integration of mental toughness and psychological performance enhancement techniques within all other training at the Academy and Department.\nMore specifically, the ESPC and program seeks to provide individual training for Troopers/Cadets as may be desired and/or indicated. It may also provide remediation for enhancement of Cadet/Trooper performance in general or under stressful conditions\nA further goal is to disseminate such knowledge and techniques to instructors and to develop relevant instructional materials and training experiences for current Troopers. A hallmark of the ESPC and program is to provide consultation when asked and work with instructors to develop fully integrated training whatever the particular skill area or knowledge base. Related to this is the goal of providing evaluation/research on the effectiveness of integrating such psychological performance enhancement techniques.\nWhile the current focus is within the Academy and Department, there is potential availability as a resource for training in psychological performance enhancement for other agencies. The ESPC is expected to allow and promote networking with other agencies, universities and resources on police performance enhancement.\nIt should be emphasized that the ESP Center/ program is not a mental health support service. The focus here is on performance enhancement. Mental health support is critical (provided to PSP in comprehensive and effective form by the peer counseling/Members’ Assistance Program) and not to be minimized in any way; but it is not the direct function of this program.\nThe ESP Center and program is lead by co-directors... an Academy Command Officer and the Department Psychologist. Important consultation is provided by the State Police Medical Officers, especially where physiological/medical factors may have degrading impact on performance or in enhancing performance effects and in helping injured personnel rehabilitate more efficiently while preventing undue atrophy of skills already attained. Essential is the input and guidance from an advisory committee comprised of instructors and staff from various education and skill areas within the Academy and Field training programs.\nTraining and service is delivered by the Department Psychologist in the role as co-director and is augmented by the expertise of various instructors with particular interest in the program.\nIt should be noted that not all police instructors, nor even all psychologists working in police environments, will have experience or knowledge of performance enhancement techniques. It is essential that all personnel involved with the activities of such a program have experience and training in empirically based and accepted psychological performance skills.\nDevelopment and Cost\nThe development and cost of such a Center and program could be quite expensive depending on the need to acquire sophisticated equipment and expertise. In the case of this Center, the cost has been minimal. Due to the willingness of staff to dedicate a portion of their time to the effort, there have been no additional staff costs. Initial equipment has been provided by staff who already have items in their possession (such as laptop computer, heart rate monitor, biofeedback equipment or relevant software). Any direct costs are simply those of the dedication of space, extant equipment and typical stationery supplies already part of Academy function. It is expected that expansion of the program will rely on grant monies or budget requests contingent on demonstration of effectiveness.\nInitial Activity and Response\nThe ESPC has been operational on a part-time basis. The initial goal was to make staff aware of the ESPC and establish a common baseline of knowledge regarding integrating physical, tactical and psychological skills. To this end, a 3-4 hour program was developed and is being delivered to instructional staff at the Academy in each training unit. As a result of this and other training, the ESPC has been contacted to help design other training evolutions such as stress-inducing scenarios. It has also promoted contact with University-based resources for the development of programs for cadet safety such as concussion prevention and recognition. Specific instructional modules have been requested for integration into specialized training such as marksmanship development or SCBA/chemical suit use.\nInitial discussion with the concurrent class of cadets regarding the nature and availability of such a skills training program by their platoon leader resulted in multiple requests to participate or to seek individualized training for performance maximization. There have also been requests for “group” training on specific skills by and for cadets.\nTraining has been developed or delivered to three advanced training programs for current Troopers. Currently six or more training programs have been requested and are being delivered to associated or public police agencies.\nThe integration of psychological and mental toughness training with physical and tactical skill development has tremendous potential to maximize the effectiveness and safety of police officers. Those concepts and approaches now exist. Expanding research demonstrates effectiveness of an integrated approach. It is possible to develop a program to promote and deliver this integrated training for police officers with minimal cost and minimal administrative complexities.\nSpecial acknowledgement and appreciation is expressed to Lt.

A professional level music therapist with a bachelor's degree provides supportive treatment within interdisciplinary teams, using musical experiences, instruments, and techniques to meet therapeutic goals. They assess clients' musical preferences, develop treatment plans, and conduct individual and group therapy sessions. Speech language pathologists, requiring six years of education, focus on diagnosing and treating speech, language, communication, voice, fluency, cognitive, and swallowing disorders. They help patients with speech sound production, rhythm problems, voice quality issues, and oral motor problems, while also addressing cognitive communication impairments like attention or memory disorders.	"[""American Music Therapy Association\nPreamble to AMTA Professional Competencies\nThe American Music Therapy Association has established competency-based standards for ensuring the quality of education and clinical training in the field of music therapy. As the clinical and research activities of music therapy provide new information, the competency requirements need to be reevaluated regularly to ensure consistency with current trends and needs of the profession and to reflect the growth of the knowledge base of the profession. The Association updates these competencies based on what knowledge, skills, and abilities are needed to perform the various levels and types of responsibilities to practice at a professional level.\nIn November 2005 the AMTA Assembly of Delegates adopted the Advisory on Levels of Practice in Music Therapy. This Advisory, which was developed by the Education and Training Advisory Board, distinguishes two Levels of Practice within the music therapy profession: Professional Level of Practice and Advanced Level of Practice. This Advisory describes the Professional Level of Practice as follows:\nA music therapist at the Professional Level of Practice has a Bachelor’s degree or its equivalent in music therapy and a current professional designation or credential in music therapy (i.e., ACMT, CMT, MT-BC, or RMT). At this level, the therapist has the ability to assume a supportive role in treating clients, collaborating within an interdisciplinary team to contribute to the client’s overall treatment plan.\nThe AMTA Professional Competencies are based on music therapy competencies authored for the former American Association for Music Therapy (AAMT) by Bruscia, Hesser, and Boxhill (1981). The former National Association for Music Therapy (NAMT) in turn adapted these competencies as the NAMT Professional Competencies revised in 1996. In its final report the Commission on Education and Clinical Training recommended the use of these competencies, and this recommendation was approved by the AMTA Assembly of Delegates in November 1999. The AMTA Professional Competencies has had several minor revisions since its adoption in 1999.\nA. MUSIC FOUNDATIONS\n1. Music Theory and History\n1.1 Recognize standard works in the literature.\n1.2 Identify the elemental, structural, and stylistic characteristics of music from various periods and cultures.\n1.3 Sight-sing melodies of both diatonic and chromatic makeup.\n1.4 Take aural dictation of melodies, rhythms, and chord progressions.\n1.5 Transpose simple compositions.\n2.

Is the idea of helping others in some way while earning money appealing to you? There are many different career options in the healthcare field which include both skilled and unskilled labor. The choice is yours as to whether you wish to pursue a job that requires many years of education, several years or none at all. The following career options all have excellent job outlooks.\nThis area of expertise is growing faster than average according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Physical therapy (also referred to as physiotherapy) requires assessing, diagnosing and treating disease or injury disabilities. You would look over the patient’s medical history and test and measure things such as: strength, balance and coordination, range of motion, motor function, muscle performance, respiration and posture. Physical therapists utilize methods such as hot and cold therapy, manipulation, massage, traction and exercise to help their patients recover from or learn to manage physical challenges. Physical therapy can be a very demanding job physically as you may have to lift patients or move heavy equipment. Standing for long periods of time, crouching, kneeling and stooping are all part of being a physical therapist. In order to become a physical therapist you need between six to nine years of schooling. You can possibly work in a hospital, a clinic or a private office that is specially equipped. Physical therapists can conduct their work in hospital rooms, schools or homes. You can choose to work part-time or full-time.\nPhysical Therapy Assistant\nIf the area of physical therapy interests you but you don’t want to attend school for six to nine years then a physical therapy assistant could be your calling. A physical therapy assistant performs parts of physical therapy procedures and tasks but is assigned their duties by a supervising physical therapist. You would assist the physical therapist with various therapies intended to help patients improve their mobility, prevent or limit permanent damage which is physical and relieve pain. Patients could be accident victims or have a short or long-term disability of some type. This job is also physically demanding in the same manner as a physical therapist as you perform many of the same tasks such as lifting a patient. To become a physical therapy assistant you only need two years of education and can make an average of $46,000.\nOccupational therapists help clients to perform a variety of daily activities such as getting dressed, eating or using a computer. Typically your duties would include: creating treatment plans that increase a person’s ability to perform every day activities; conducting home and job site evaluations and recommending adaptations for the patient; training patients on recommended adaptation equipment; and providing guidance for caregivers and family members. Occupational therapists work in hospitals, schools and various other healthcare and community settings. More than one-third of all occupational therapists work part-time. Six years or more of education is typically required to become an OT. The average salary is upwards of $66,000. The job outlook for OT’s is excellent.\n- Occupational Therapist Education: Website describes the career option and the job responsibilities, work environment and characteristics needed to be successful.\n- About Occupational Therapy: The American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc. website discusses exactly what occupational therapy is and provides links for people seeking more on the subject.\n- Career Information: The Duquesne University website explains occupational therapy as a profession and career, career growth options, job outlook and employment options as well as other things.\n- What is an Occupational Therapist?: The University of Rochester Medical Center website explains what an occupational therapist is.\nOccupational Therapy Aide\nThe assembly of equipment used during treatment and the preparation of materials are often performed by an occupational therapy aide. There are many other duties that an occupational therapy aide does such as answering phones, clerical work, ordering and restocking depleted supplies, and completing insurance forms and other paperwork. This position does not require further education and training is often conducted on the job. It is not a licensed position so you do not perform as diverse a range of tasks as occupational therapy assistants.\n- Occupational Therapy Assistants and Aides: The Occupational Outlook Handbook provides significant points, nature of the work, working conditions, employment and other relevant information.\n- About Occupational Therapy: An excellent PDF from the University of South Carolina that discusses the field of occupational therapy, different jobs within the field and education and career planning.\n- Occupational Therapy Aide Career Information: This website explains what the job is, what they do, necessary knowledge, skills, abilities, work activities and other important issues.\nSpeech Language Pathologist\nA speech language pathologist performs assessments, diagnoses and treats problems with speech, language, communication, voice, fluency, cognitive, swallowing and other similar disorders. They can also help to prevent these disorders. When a person has a problem making speech sounds clearly or correctly a speech pathologist can help them. Some people also have problems with the rhythm of their speech or with fluency. There are voice quality problems such as a harsh voice. People can have problems understanding language or may merely want to improve their communication skills by modifying an accent. Some people suffer from cognitive communication impairments such as attention or memory disorders. Eating and swallowing disorders caused by oral motor problems can also be aided by a speech language pathologist. Speech language pathologists can help many different people with a variety of problems. If you are considering becoming a speech language pathologist you should have good attention to detail, be able to concentrate intensely, possess the required knowledge and skills, and be able to deal with the emotional needs of patients and their families (which can be quite demanding).

This process is believed to help people to resolve conflicts, reduce stress, and manage behavior as well as other important things. The therapist can help a patient mentally, physically and emotionally through art and conversation. It is a combination of the fields of visual arts, human development and the creative process with forms of psychotherapy and counseling. It can be used with people of all ages for problems including: anxiety, mental illness, depression, substance abuse, relationship issues, and personal trauma among others.

They are formally trained to provide healthcare services recommended by the physician such as diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic. PA’s are part of a healthcare team and write down medical histories, look at and treat patients, order x-rays and laboratory tests and interpret results, make diagnoses and often prescribe medicine. Minor injuries that can be splintered, casted or sutured can be handled by PA’s. They can chart a patient’s progress, state and assist with therapy, and teach and counsel patients. They may have some managerial tasks such as supervising assistants and technicians. Sometimes they order lab and medical supplies.

RN’s are advocates and health educators for not only patients but also their families and communities. When working directly with a patient they observe, assess and document progress and reactions which lead to the determination of necessary care and intervention. RN’s are very important members of healthcare teams. There are many different jobs RN’s can perform besides patient care and management such as developing nursing practice standards, creating quality assurance procedures and conducting clinical research. They work with physicians and other healthcare providers. There are many specialty options available to RN’s that have their own training and certification requirements such as a Labor and Delivery Staff Nurse, a Critical-Care Nurse or a School Nurse. Four Advanced Practice clinical professions are also available to RN’s but all require a master’s degree and a separate certification.

14	How are firefighter funerals coordinated and what traditions are involved?	Firefighter funerals are coordinated by department advocates who help families with planning while incorporating specific traditions. These include the Honor Guard forming receiving lines and carrying the caisson, bagpipers playing traditional songs, placing the helmet on the altar, draping the casket with the firehouse flag, performing the 'Tolling of the Bell' ceremony, and making a final radio call. The fire department assists with arrangements like uniform burial options, while police help coordinate the procession route.	"['The Honor Guard represents the Lubbock Fire Department at funerals, memorial services, and any other function authorized/requested by the Chief of the department or his designee. Requests should be made through Fire Administration or Fire Dispatch.\nThe Honor Guard will serve both current and retired Fire Department members in any way possible. Our goal is to represent all members of the Fire Department in the highest degree of professionalism, dedication, loyalty, honor and dignity possible. We strive to honor firefighters in life, as well as death, and to exhibit the best possible image to the entire community. In addition to funerals and memorial services the honor guard may be called upon to post colors, march in parades, attend new station grand openings (ring in-service), social functions, other departments firefighters’, fire victims funerals, assist families during a time of need and stand guard at funeral homes. The Lubbock Fire Department Honor Guard is funded primarily through the City of Lubbock and Lubbock Professional Firefighters Association. Private donations have also contributed greatly and have been used to purchase equipment such as our bell, flag harness’s and the like. All honor guard members donate their time to attend all functions and meetings, pay for dry cleaning, and receive no monetary compensation. Services\nThere are a few things we will do as an Honor Guard that will be basic to every service. These basics may vary depending upon special requests from the family. We will assist in any way we can to be of service to the family.\nOne thing we will always try to set up is a receiving line. This will consist of the Honor Guard members lined up on one straight line or two lines facing each other just inside the door to the sanctuary. This provides a way for us to greet the guests and answer any questions they may have about the service. Seeing a familiar face when they walk through the door may make some people more comfortable.\nAfter all of the guests have taken their seats, the Honor Guard will file in and salute the Caisson.\nWhen the service has ended, the Honor Guard will file out of the sanctuary to carry the Caisson to the funeral coach and load the Caisson (or as requested by the family). The funeral coach may be a standard hearse or a fire engine.\nOnce at the cemetery the Honor Guard usually unloads the Caisson and carries it to the gravesite. At the end of the memorial service the Guard will fold and present the flag, if applicable, play taps, salute the deceased, ring the last alarm and offer condolences to the family.\nBag pipers are available and will play at the church or the gravesite or both. There is a nominal fee for most pipers. Protocols for Department members\nLine of Duty Death.\nIt is appropriate for all members to wear a mourning band over their badge in honor of any firefighter killed in the line of duty. This includes not only members of our department but any other area departments, professional or volunteer. The mourning band should be worn anytime the Class A uniform is worn (at the station, or in public) from the time their death is announced until after the funeral.\nHonor Guard members and volunteer department members will be present at the funeral home during their business hours until the time of the funeral.\nAny engine or truck companies may post their apparatus along the precession route with all emergency lights on, standing in view of the precession. Come to attention and present arms just prior to the funeral coach passing and remain until after the family has passed (order arms after family passes). Stand at attention until the entire precession has passed.', 'Firefighter funeral traditions show the deep gratitude and respect that the community holds for the selfless and brave contribution firefighters make to the protection and safety of society. When a firefighter dies, he is considered a ""fallen hero,"" and his funeral will reflect his honorable career and life. Certain funeral aspects are retained only for firefighters, signifying what they have given, what they have lost, and how deeply they will be missed.\nWho Receives a Firefighter Funeral?\nIf a firefighter passes away in the line of duty, it can be assumed that a firefighter memorial, with traditions, will be held in honor of that person. Others might also qualify for this unique and meaningful set of funeral traditions. They include:\n- Firefighters who passed while off duty: This might include a tragic passing or a passing due to a decline in health\n- Retired firefighter: Can include volunteer firefighters as well as occupational firefighters\n- Firefighter service worker: Might include a person who worked closely with the fire department, for example, a dispatcher\n- Immediate family member: In the case of severe illness or the tragic passing of a firefighter\'s spouse or child\nFirefighter Funeral Traditions and Protocol\nWhen a firefighter dies, the family is not left alone to plan the funeral. Most fire departments have advocates that assist the family with grief counseling and help make appropriate arrangements for the funeral. Some fire departments have specific protocols they wish to be followed when one of their own dies. Families can plan the funeral around their own religious beliefs while keeping in mind firefighter funeral traditions. The following questions may be asked of the family, so the advocate can plan the funeral in accordance with what the family wants:\n- Does the family want the deceased firefighter buried with full department honors?\n- Does the family want a church funeral, and where will it be?\n- Who is their religious leader?\n- What funeral home will they be using?\n- Who does the family want as pallbearers?\n- Will there be an open casket?\nAside from these common questions that help drive the direction of the firefighter funeral, families will need to choose from four types of funeral classifications.\n- Formal service - Common service for those who fell in the line of duty. This high honor includes personnel in full Class A uniforms, optional color guards and bagpipes, uniformed firefighters serving as pallbearers, and the Fire Chief delivering the eulogy.\n- Semi-Formal Service - This will include several of the elements of the formal service and is common for firefighters who died off duty.\n- Informal Service - Includes many of the same offerings as a formal and semi-formal service. Normally reserved for volunteer firefighters or the immediate family of a firefighter.\n- Private Service - Not publicized to the public. Only open to family and select service members.\nFirefighter funerals are often attended by other firefighters and loved ones from all over the nation. A hotel should be chosen that can make accommodations for out-of-town guests. Oftentimes, reserving a block of rooms at a time will result in a discount for the guests who plan to attend the memorial. Work with local hotels to ensure guests are nearby one another (you may have to reserve rooms at a few hotels), and receive a lower rate during their stay.\nThe police department will be assisting with the firefighter\'s funeral procession. They often arrange a traffic route for the funeral procession, lead the procession, and provide traffic control when necessary.\nOne of the most recognized firefighter funeral traditions is pipers playing ""Amazing Grace"" or another religious song at the funeral on bagpipes. The tradition of having bagpipes at firefighters\' funerals dates back to the 1800s when Irish and Scottish immigrants were usually forced to take the difficult and dangerous jobs, such as firefighting, that nobody else wanted. Those Irish and Scottish firefighters\' funerals had the typical bagpipes playing, and the tradition has held since.\nHelmet on the Altar\nIt is a typical funeral tradition to have the firefighter\'s helmet placed upon the casket or on the altar during the funeral service.\nAn honor guard gets selected from fellow firefighters or police officers. These individuals stand guard at the entrance to the funeral and are commonly dressed in their formal blues. The honor guard posts the colors during the service and act as pallbearers to carry the casket. At the end of the funeral service, the honor guard, along with as many police and firefighters as possible, may line up in two rows and allow the family to pass through the center as a show of respect.\nThe casket will be draped with the flag from the firehouse the firefighter served in during their career. At the end of the ceremony, the color guard will ceremoniously fold the flag and pass it to the next of kin to keep.\nTolling of the Bell and Last Call\nDuring each firefighter funeral, there is the ceremony of the ""Tolling of the Bell,"" where bells gong in a succinct and traditional pattern. The bell ceremony is reminiscent of the original firehouse bells that tolled when there was a fire. The actual ceremony is based upon the pattern of the original method of communicating that a firefighter had fallen, which is the telegraph. The telegrapher would tap out the word ""fell"" with five measured dashes, a pause, and then repeated this two more times.\nWith reference to last call, a dispatcher will call the deceased firefighter\'s name over the radio, signaling the last call for them. A few moments of silence follow the call. The term ""call home"" is recited along with the firefighter\'s name and date of passing.\nBuried in Uniform\nFallen firefighters will commonly be buried in uniform. If the family wishes this, the fire department often supplies a new uniform for this purpose. It is important to note that being buried in uniform isn\'t mandatory and families sometimes choose to bury their loved ones in garments other than the firefighter uniform.\nFlowers for a Firefighter Funeral\nFlowers are typical adornments at many types of funerals, firefighter memorials included. If you choose to include flowers at your fallen firefighter\'s funeral, let your florist know of the deceased\'s high honor. Typically florists will include specific elements to the floral arrangements that signify this type of passing, including a Maltese cross, a helmet, the service member department logo/patch, a crossed pike pole, and ax, or a broken rung ladder. Beyond this, it is tradition to have a firetruck transport the flowers to the funeral space.\nFire Rig Leads the Funeral Procession\nAt every firefighter\'s funeral, you will see several fire rigs in attendance, paying respect. It is a common tradition that the deceased\'s own fire rig will lead the funeral procession to the cemetery.\nFirefighter Funerals Honor the Fallen Heros\nIt is a sad occasion when a firefighter passes away in the line of duty or otherwise. Firefighter funeral traditions help all show proper respect and gratitude to a person who dedicated their living to serving and protecting others. It is a way to give back to someone who gave their life for others and remember them in the highest esteem.']"	['<urn:uuid:006a6ba0-cad1-4497-9de1-f5f14e14653c>', '<urn:uuid:b2eb9afe-82a7-441d-9e1a-7bf8e49fad85>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	10	75	1833
15	columbus day celebration protests historical records	While some US cities like New York and Boston still hold Columbus Day parades, many locations host protests and cultural events celebrating indigenous diversity. This modern tension reflects historical accounts documented in writings like Gaspar Pérez de Villagrá's 'Historia de la Nueva México', which chronicles colonial brutalities, and contemporary actions like Argentina's removal of Columbus's statue and its replacement with indigenous hero Juana Azurduy's sculpture.	['On October 12, 1492, an Italian explorer named Christopher Columbus arrived on the shores of the “New World.” He meant to exploit the lucrative spice trade in the East Indies, but instead he introduced colonization to the Americas – an event that would forever change the course of history on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.\nThis colossal historical event is still recognized in some North American states, as well as many Latin American and European countries. However, it’s not without controversy. While for some Europeans and North Americans this day marks the expansion of the Western World, for indigenous people it serves as a reminder of what was to come: hundreds of years of genocide, slavery, and cultural repression.\nIn an attempt to reclaim the day their lands were “discovered” by foreign powers, countries across Latin America (as well as certain states in North America) have renamed the holiday – and have instead shifted the focus from glorifying Columbus and his “Discovery of America” to honoring the bravery of the victims of colonialism, as well as protecting indigenous communities who still suffer from the effects of capitalism today. Here’s are the new names and what they mean to each country.\nDating as far back as the 17th century, “Columbus Day” – a nation-wide commemoration of the explorer and colonist Christopher Columbus – has been celebrated in the US for hundreds of years. In 1937, the second Monday of October became a federal holiday in the USA. To this day, big street parades and festivities still take place in cities such as New York and Boston in honor of Columbus.\nThe idea is to celebrate American nationalism, and some will argue that Columbus Day celebrates immigration and exploration. Increasingly, however, there have been disputes over whether this is appropriate and if one culture repressed the other. Some states such as Oregon, Vermont, and South Dakota now dedicate the celebration to the victims of colonialism by changing the name of the holiday to “Indigenous People’s Day” or “Native American Day.” Some have chosen not to celebrate the day at all.\nChile’s official name for October 12 used to be Aniversario del Descubrimiento de América (“Anniversary of the Discovery of America”) for much of the 1900s. At the turn of the 21st century, however, Chile renamed the celebration Día del Descubrimiento de Dos Mundos (“Day of the Discovery of Two Worlds”), which suggests that each of the two sides of the ocean realized one another’s existence from their own perspectives. For the 500th anniversary of Columbus’ arrival in the Americas, the country used the slogan Encuentro de Dos Mundos (“The Coming Together of Two Worlds”). Today, Día del Descubrimiento de Dos Mundos is marked by protests, parades, and cultural events that aim to celebrate Chile’s diverse ethnic groups.\nMost other countries in Latin America knew the holiday as Día de la Raza (“Day of Race”). This name took the limelight off Columbus or “discovery” from a foreign perspective and instead aimed to celebrate the “melting pot” of European and indigenous people that made up Latin America’s multi-cultural society. However, in 1994, Costa Rica changed its official name from Día de la Raza to Día del Encuentro de las Culturas (“Day of the Encounter of Cultures”). Believing that “Dia de la Raza” was still a derogatory and racist label, the new name aimed at promoting and celebrating the ethnic diversity that resulted from the Spanish conquest.\nSome years after Chile and Costa Rica’s relabelling, Venezuela and Nicaragua decided that it was time they changed the name of the yearly celebration, too. However, President Hugo Chávez took it to the next level. In 2002, he announced that Dia de la Raza in Venezuela would now be called Día de la Resistencia Indígena (“Day of Indigenous Resistance”). For the first time in history, this new name voiced loud and clear that “Dia de la Raza” shouldn’t be about celebrating cultural diversity (created by the oppressor), but should instead honor the bravery of those who fought with their lives to preserve indigenous culture during the Spanish conquest. In 2007, Nicaragua followed suit.\nPast events to celebrate Día de la Resistencia Indígena have included huge city marches, the unveiling of new statues of indigenous heroes such as Tiuna (which now replaces the statue of Christopher Columbus in Caracas), and official re-distribution of land to indigenous groups.\nPossibly emboldened by Venezuela and Nicaragua’s display of activism, Argentina soon made changes to their celebration as well. Encouraged by former Venezuelan President Chávez, the Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner changed the name from Día de la Raza (which had been established in Argentina in 1916) to Día del Respeto de la Diversidad de Cultura (“Day of Respect for Cultural Diversity”) in 2010.\nWhile not as overt as Venezuela’s choice, Cristina Kirchner’s renaming of Dia de la Raza was followed by a bold gesture: she removed the statue of Christopher Columbus outside the presidential palace in Buenos Aires and replaced it with a 15-meter-high sculpture of female indigenous war hero, Juana Azurduy.\nToday, Argentina celebrates Dia del Respeto de la Diversidad de Cultura by giving the day off to all Argentinians and putting on cultural events to encourage awareness and understanding between different ethnicities.\nJust a year after Argentina’s decision to change the name marking Columbus’s arrival to the Americas, Bolivia also took an inspired step. On October 12, 2011, Bolivia’s first indigenous president, Evo Morales, announced that Bolivia would now refer to Dia de la Raza as Dia de Descolonizacion (“Day of Decolonization”). But this wasn’t just about appearances; the change in name also marked a considerable change in the celebration itself. Instead of dedicating the day to cultural diversity, Dia de Descolonizacion today is first and foremost about supporting indigenous communities (through redistribution of land, educational events, and governmental funding) who continue to be displaced and underrepresented today.', 'October 12, 2015\nFNS Editor’s Note: As part of our special coverage marking the historic transformation of Columbus Day into Indigenous Peoples Day, we offer this contribution by Nicolás Cabrera. He is a graduate student who specializes in Spanish literature at NMSU. Cabrera’s piece discusses Latin American manifestations of the movement, as well as historical accounts of the early conquest period that provide essential background information to today’s debates and controversies.\nOctober 12, 2015\nNMSU Student Series\nFor several decades there have been movements to redefine the holiday that falls on October 12th. In the United States this holiday is traditionally known as Columbus Day while in many Latin American countries it goes by a different name. Recently Albuquerque joined dozens of other cities in a change that is being led by Native American and Chicano leaders and supporters.\n“It is true that this specific movement is about indigenous peoples,” said Albuquerque City Council member Rey Garduño. “As a Chicano and an ally I stand with my Indigenous sisters and brothers.”\nGarduño was instrumental in having the Albuquerque City Council join other municipalities across the country vote in voting October 7 to recognize Indigenous Peoples Day with a proclamation for October 12th.\nNative American activist Melanie Yazzie explained why this is an issue for everybody. She said, “Because the history of conquest, slavery, and globalized violence that Columbus actively participated in is one that continues and affects us all.”\nThe redefinition of the holiday began in Latin America in the 20th century where the trend to rename and redefine the October 12th has had the most success.\nFor example, in Costa Rica it’s called “El Día de las Culturas” (Day of the Cultures) while in Mexico and many other Latin American countries it’s called “El Día de la Raza” which is best translated as “Day of the People.”In Nicaragua it is called “Día de la Resistencia Indígena” (Day of Indigenous Resistance) and Peru calls it “Día de los Pueblos Originarios y del Diálogo Intercultural” (Day of the Native Peoples and Intercultural Dialog).\nLastly, in Spain October 12th was originally called “Fiesta de la Raza” but has since been changed to simply “Fiesta Nacional.”\nAndrea Runyan is another activist working to change people’s perceptions of the holiday. Runyan said the movement to replace the holiday is growing because people are “recognizing the resilience of Native communities that have persisted despite genocidal efforts to eradicate them.”\nGarduño’s solidarity, Yazzie’s resistance, and Runyan’s activism are rooted in history that is accessible to everybody who wants to learn more about what took place during the initial decades of contact.\nThe first Spaniards who made contact with Native Americans left several accounts of tremendous historical, anthropological, and literary value. The authors, who were all men, tell the story of conflict and struggle from their own personal experiences.\nChristopher Columbus wrote the first accounts and his two most important pieces are “Carta del descubrimiento” and “Diario de a bordo.” In these works he describes the first contact he and his crew had with Native Americans as they toured several Caribbean islands.\nHernán Cortés, the famed conqueror of the Valley of Mexico, wrote “Cartas de relación” of which“Segunda carta de relación” is the most important. In the second letter he gives a detailed account of his journey to topple Tenochtitlán, the Aztec capital.\nBernal Díaz de Castillo wrote “De historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España” that presents his personal account of the conquest of Mexico as a solider of Cortés.\n“Naufragios” was written by Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca. This work describes the Native Americans he and his fellow shipwrecked explorers met and encountered during their eight-year journey. They were lost near present-day Galveston, Texas and together they wandered from the Gulf Coast through the present-day U.S. Southwest back to Mexico City.\nIn “Brevísima relaciónde la destrucción de las Indias” author Bartolomé de las Casas gives an extraordinary account of several encounters he saw first-hand as he traveled throughout the Americas.\nHe was in a unique position as a friar and bishop to travel and he took an extended journey to an unprecedented number of places. His work is valuable because it documented many of the atrocities and the brutal treatment committed by the Spaniards against the local populations.\nUpon his return to Spain he became one of the most vocal critics of the abuse and cruelty he witnessed. Casas helped to push for new laws and protections thereby becoming one of the first Europeans to fight for human rights in the Americas.\nAn important local account about New Mexico can be found in “Historia de la Nueva México” which was written by Gaspar Pérez de Villagrá. In it he gives his account of the arrival of Juan de Oñate, soldiers, and colonists. It begins with the founding of the first Spanish-Mexican settlements in and around Santa Fe.\nBut most importantly it chronicles the brutalities committed against the members of the Pueblo de Ácoma by Oñate and his men.\nAll of these historical accounts of the first contacts between Native Americans and Europeans have been translated to English. As documents in the public domain, they can be consulted online as well as in public and university libraries.\nFrontera NorteSur: on-line, U.S.-Mexico border news\nCenter for Latin American and Border Studies\nNew Mexico State University\nLas Cruces, New Mexico\nFor a free electronic subscription']	['<urn:uuid:941ca5a4-db95-449c-bc55-88ef403fa09c>', '<urn:uuid:d7b80510-804f-4da2-90cc-bfd3515e9ed6>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	6	65	1877
16	breeding conditions water temperature oscars bream fish eggs	Carp bream spawn around April in 17°C (73°F) waters, while oscars require a minimum 55-gallon tank for breeding and lay cloudy off-white to tan colored eggs that hatch in 3-7 days depending on temperature. Oscar eggs develop into eyeless blobs attached to slate, eventually becoming free-swimming fry with a black line down their sides.	['The size of the bream varies among the species. The carp bream (Abramis brama) can reach 30 to 55 centimeters (12 to 20 inches) in length. Some of the variants are known to reach 30 inches. Their weight can vary between 4 to 9 lbs.\nBream is a term used for various kinds of freshwater fish. There are several genera that fall under this bream definition. They include Abramis, Blicca, Acanthopagrus, Argyrops, Chilotilapia, Brama, Nemipterus, Scolopsis, Rhabdosargus Lepomis, Gymnocranius and many more.\nWhile the aforementioned genera are all bream, this does not imply that all are closely related. However, many of them have deep, narrow bodies. Sometimes the term bream is used to describe the pomfrets and porgies.\nThe Abramis Genus\nThe average size of the bream is 14 to 33 inches (35 to 82 cm). The average weight is 2 to 13 lbs (1 to 6 kg). The Abramis genus is of the family Cyprinidae (the order is Cypriniformes).\nThe species can be found in the waters of northern Europe. The species usually have bodies shaped like lozenges which are flattened. The color varies from silver to brown.\nThe fish are omnivorous. Their diet consists of invertebrates and numerous plants. On occasion the Abramis feeds on small fish. In turn, the Abramis are food for the pikes and other big fish.\nThe species in the genera are the white-eye bream (Abramis sapa), zope (Abramis ballerus), silver bream (Abramis bjoerkna) and the carp bream (Abramis brama).\nThe Carp Bream\nAs stated, the average size of the bream in this species is between 30 to 55 cm. Known simply as bream in the United Kingdom, the fish can be found in rivers and canals. Their range extends from the Pyrenees to the Balkans. The fish is also found in the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea and the Aral Sea.\nThe carp bream has a high backed body, while the mouth is inferior. The fish is usually silver gray but some variants are bronze-like in appearance. The fins are either black or gray.\nThe fish looks very similar to the silver bream. The only discernible difference is that carp bream have nine scales or less. The silver bream has no less than eleven.\nAside from rivers, the carp bream can be seen in lakes, the muddy bottoms, algae and some ponds. The fish like to go there because of the nutrients. The fish can also be seen at brackish sea waters. The schools of fish are usually found near the bottom of the sea.\nDuring the evenings the bream will come close to the top. Its diet consists of gastropods, bivalves, chironomidae larvae and different types of water plants. The carp beam spawns around April. This usually takes place in 17 C (73 F) waters.\nAs the size of the bream is dependent on the species, it is essential for anyone studying it to make sure they identify the correct type. As in the case of the silver and carp bream, confusion can easily occur.', 'Oscars Chapter 5\nMisc Frogs II\nMisc Frogs III\nMisc Frogs IV\nMisc Frogs V\nPet World Visit\nGood looking fish with the start of a bad eye. He needs a water change now.\nNeeds Space. Oscars not only need elbow room, they will take it from their tank mates (by killing or eating them). This applies to other oscars in limited quarters. You can uncomfortably house a single in a 20-gallon tank. They really need 30+ gallons. Two adults will co-exist in a 55. They need a 70. Four can live in the 70, but expect lots of arguments.\nMr. Personality. New oscars pout. They lie on one side and look up at you with one untrusting eye. They’ll do the same if you redecorate their tank or move them to new quarters. When you net your oscar, expect to get a free shower. Some thrash so much they “foam” up their net. When you put him in the new tank, he’ll extend his hard rays and make it difficult for you to get him out of the net. Just like a freshly hooked bluegill. Don’t touch him unless absolutely necessary. His top and bottom fins are “stabbers.” You will find this out the first time you try to pick him up after he jumps out on the floor. Use a wet net, not your bare hands.\nNew Oscars. Resident oscars consider new oscars intruders invading their living room. The current occupant will try to evict the new tenant. The bigger the oscars, the bigger the fight (and the bigger the splash).\nLike to Argue. Oscars also fight because they feel good, want to breed, or just want a little exercise. Their French web site calls them “toujour agressif.” Very aggressive describes oscars quite aptly.\nFighting or Spawning? Oscars fight by slapping each other while facing head to tail. They also lock lips and wrestle each other and try to bite chunks out of each other. (Typical pre-spawning behavior also.) Expect these arguments. If they get too violent, put in a divider. Add NovAqua to “bandage” their wounds and abrasions.\nGood Fighters. Wild oscars in Florida escaped from flooded fish farm ponds or were released by fishermen who saw their fighting potential as a game fish. Their pugnacious natures make them a great fish to catch on hook and line. They put the “game” in game fish. They fight better than bass. They taste better, too.\nBig Bruisers. Oscars break heater tubes, power filter intakes, under gravel filter stems, and floating thermometers. Some they break by running into them accidentally. Others they break on purpose. They consider these items “oscar toys.” If you replace them, your oscar will probably break them again. Use suction cup holders to reduce breakage and figure out less superfragilistic ways to replace broken equipment. If you want to give them a toy, toss in a ping pong ball occasionally. Forget the paddles.\nDécor. Forget beautifully decorated planted aquaria like Amano-san constructs. Oscars rarely tolerate live plants. Use plastics. Weight the bottoms so they look normal when your oscars move them. (And they will.) Epoxy a gob of gravel on their base. Use the same gravel as their tank substrate. When they move them, the plants still look planted. Avoid rough rocks and sharp pieces of wood. Why ask for trouble? Arguing oscars can very easily injure themselves on sharp objects.\nGrowth Variation. If you start with equal-sized oscars, sometimes one grows faster. The big one gets most of the food and then grows even faster. Whip out your divider and separate them. Reduce the rations going into the large guy and give the extra to the little guy. He’ll catch up (usually). If you move one to a different tank, put the bigger guy in the smaller tank.\nPreventing Stunting. You’ve heard many people say “fish grow to the size of their tank.” You can stunt an oscar in a 10-gallon tank. But why put one of these potentially huge fishes in a little tank? Get a neon tetra. Okay, so you had no idea how big he’d get and he’s in your 10-gallon tank. How do you keep from stunting him? Stunting results from the waste products in the water – not from bouncing off the glass walls. Just change the water more often and/or make larger changes. You can grow a huge (and very uncomfortable) oscar in a 10-gallon tank, if you change enough of his water often enough. So reach under your mattress and extract enough of your tax refund to house him right. Or get him a home equity loan.\nBreeding Oscars. You won’t breed them in a 10. You need (minimum) a 55-gallon tank (70 gallons would be better). In fish farms they use a large diameter concrete pool two feet deep -- very similar to a kid’s wading pool in a public park, but with steep sides. They put in lots of large oscars and let them select their own mates. The breeder adds several large pieces of slate (some on the bottom, some leaning against the sides). The slates are checked frequently for spawns. Slates of eggs are removed and hatched artificially under controlled conditions. You can get bit walking thru these breeding ponds -- especially when extracting egg-filled slates.\nBreeding Tank. In your breeding tank partially bury a large slab of slate. Let them dig it out themselves. (If they spawn on the filter plate, the eggs and fry get sucked under.) Take out the eggs. Do it at night, if you fear oscar hickies. You will have better results rearing the eggs artificially.\nOscar Eggs. Put the slate in a well-filtered 10-gallon tank and add a slow bubbling airstone as their surrogate mama. Add methylene blue to taste (circa 2 ppm). Most cichlid eggs are clear or a light amber color. Oscar eggs are a cloudy off-white nearly tan color. As they develop, a line divides the eggs in half. They hatch in three to seven days depending upon temperature.\nHatched Eggs. Oscar eggs hatch into an eyeless blob with a wiggling tail attached to the slate by an unseen thread. They look nothing like oscars (or fish). As they absorb their yolk sacs, they lose their sticky thread and fall to the bottom in a sticky clump. Most cichlids absorb their yolk sacs fairly quickly and turn into hungry baby fishes. Oscars take much longer and grow into much larger and hungrier fry. Once they grow eyes and fins, they will start swimming (and eating). They cannot eat until they become free swimming.\nOscar Fry. Very small oscars sport a black line down their sides (typical of predator fishes who tend their young in schools). If you’ve ever seen a male largemouth bass tending his pit of fry, you’ve seen the obvious relationship between our North American centrarchids and the South American cichlids. Oscar fry eat newly hatched brine shrimp – lots of it and often. You will not believe how much they can eat. You will need to change their water often.\nOscar Babies. You find that 1,000 oscars eat mondo quantities of baby brine shrimp -- way past the glass tube quantity. Once they hit an inch or so, they lose their schooling line and develop a mottled pattern. They now look like oscars.\nFinal Word. Enjoy your oscars. Remember to change their water often. You’ll see few problems if you keep their water clean.

17	what ancient romans called pozzuoli	The Romans called the city Puteoli. It was originally founded around 529 BC by Greek emigrants who named it Dicaearchia (City of Justice), but after the Romans captured it during the Samnite wars, they gave it the name Puteoli.	['Pozzuoli, Latin Puteoli, town and episcopal see, Campania regione, southern Italy. It occupies a promontory that projects into the Gulf of Pozzuoli (an inlet of the Bay of Naples), just west of Naples.\nThe town was founded about 529 bc by Greek emigrants who called it Dicaearchia (City of Justice). Captured by Rome in the Samnite wars, it was vainly besieged by the Carthaginian general Hannibal in 214 bc and had the status of a Roman colony from 194 bc. The Romans called the city Puteoli. Its port made it a leading commercial centre and a cosmopolitan city, but it declined with the fall of the Roman Empire, and local volcanic and seismic activity caused most of its inhabitants to move to Naples. Many traces of the Roman city survive, including a well-preserved amphitheatre (1st century ad), baths, and a necropolis with stuccoed and painted underground chambers. Intense local volcanicity has given rise to thermal springs and to changes in the level of the land, which have caused temple porticoes along the shore to be submerged beneath the sea. The old Roman market (erroneously called the Temple of Serapis) of the 1st century ad is also partially submerged. The Cathedral of San Procolo incorporates several columns of the ancient Temple of Augustus. Inland, to the northeast, is the famous Solfatara, a semiactive volcano that exhales sulfurous vapours and gives vent to liquid mud and hot mineral springs. Along the coast is the Monte Nuovo, a volcanic cone that arose after eruptions in 1538.\nPozzuoli is on the Rome-Naples railway line and has a small commercial port. The fertile countryside supports a major food-processing industry in the town, which also engages in fishing and the manufacture of machinery. Many residents work in the iron- and steelworks at nearby Bagnoli. The local volcanic material is used for making the fine cement called pozzolana after the town.

18	edison patents manufacturing achievements failures	Thomas Edison was both successful and unsuccessful in different aspects of his work. He effectively sold and licensed his patents early in his career to fund his research, and later sold important innovations like his incandescent light bulb patents to General Electric. However, when he tried manufacturing his own inventions like light bulbs and phonographs, his business ventures were described as 'shaky' and 'dismal.' His true breakthrough wasn't in manufacturing but in creating new business models - his Pearl Street Station revolutionized electricity by making it available as a utility service, similar to gas. As Henry Ford famously noted, Edison was 'the world's greatest inventor and the world's worst businessman.'	['Newspapers have reported a massive patent infringement campaign against individuals—almost 1,000 farmers were sued for patent infringement in just one courthouse in a single year! Even worse, the plaintiff is not a competing farmer or manufacturer; instead, it merely bought the patent rights and is now asserting them against unsophisticated defendants for the sole purpose of obtaining royalty payments.\nIn an increasingly rare moment of agreement, members of Congress, the president, lobbying groups, and others have found a common enemy. It’s the dreaded “patent troll.” Although this term has proven next to impossible to define, it usually refers to an individual or company who doesn’t manufacture a patented invention but instead authorizes others to make or sell the innovative technology. In more legalistic terms, these are entities whose business model is licensing others to manufacture and sell patented innovation, and they do so through either contract negotiations or patent infringement lawsuits.\nRecently, the patent licensing business model has taken center stage in the public policy debates in a way not seen since the 19th century (when the popular rhetorical epithet was “patent shark”). In fact, the story of massive numbers of farmers being sued for patent infringement was not torn from today’s headlines—unless of course one is looking at headlines from the late 1880s.\nYet, many smart people assume that the patent licensing business model—and the buying and selling of patents themselves—is an entirely recent development. In 2006, for instance, Justice Anthony Kennedy stated as simple fact in eBay v. MercExchange that “An industry has developed in which firms use patents not as a basis for producing and selling goods but, instead, primarily for obtaining licensing fees.” Commentators now assert in prestigious law journals that the “patent marketplace is a relatively new secondary market.” Now we’re seeing calls that the patent laws should be changed in response to this “new” development by mandating that all patent owners manufacture or sell their patented innovations in the marketplace.\nThe problem, as I stated in testimony before Congress in the fall, is that the “patent troll” epithet would require us to condemn famous American innovators like Thomas Edison and Charles Goodyear who contributed immensely to America’s innovation economy in the 19th century. This is not hyperbole. This pejorative label has been applied to universities, such as the University of Wisconsin. It has also been applied to individual inventors who have had to sue commercial firms for infringing their patents. The reason is that they all license rather than manufacture their patented innovation. This has long been an essential feature of the American patent system in successfully and efficiently promoting new inventions and driving the innovation economy. This isn’t unique to patented innovation, as Adam Smith famously recognized in 1776; it is specialization and the division of labor that are the keys to a flourishing market—in the context of patented innovation, inventors should invent and businesspeople should manufacture and sell. This is why it was embraced by Goodyear, Edison, and others in the 19th century, and for this they would be condemned today.\nStill not convinced? Let the facts be submitted to a candid world (to turn a phrase from the Declaration of Independence).\nThomas Alva Edison\nThomas Edison both sold and licensed his patented innovations. As economists have reported, Edison sold many patents in his early career to fund his full-time research and development activities. Even after he became widely successful and famous—known as the “Wizard of Menlo Park”—Edison still participated in the secondary market, such as selling his patented innovation in incandescent light bulbs to the General Electric Co. (as discussed in a recent biography).\nBut Edison also manufactured and sold some of his patented innovations, such as his first efforts at commercially exploiting his electric light bulb and phonograph. These business ventures have been described as “shaky” and “dismal” by his biographers. The products that ultimately dominated the marketplace from Edison’s initially path-breaking inventions were oftentimes produced by his competitors, such as the Victrola record player. Henry Ford famously quipped that Edison was “the world’s greatest inventor and the world’s worst businessman.”\nEdison would have been wiser to continue to embrace market specialization—inventing in his lab and selling or licensing his patents to others to manufacture and sell his innovative products. It was doing this that brought him his fame and fortune as a young innovator at Menlo Park, and ironically it would have brought him notoriety today as a “patent troll.”\nCharles Goodyear invented the process to make vulcanized rubber in 1839 and received a patent for it in 1844, but he never manufactured or sold rubber products. Instead, Goodyear licensed his patented innovation to other individuals and firms to commercialize it. As reported by his biographers, Goodyear was basically crazy about rubber and about inventing and finding new uses for it. He even wrote a two-volume treatise on the history, invention, and uses of vulcanized rubber, called Gum Elastic and Its Varieties. As the archetype of the obsessive inventor, Goodyear was not interested at all in manufacturing or selling his patented innovation. By licensing it, he left the efficient commercial exploitation of his patented innovation to the new capitalists in the early 19th century.\nOf course, by selling his patent rights to others, including even to businesspeople who themselves embraced the patent licensing business model, Goodyear would be attacked today as a “patent troll,” just as inventors today have been attacked for this same commercial activity. In fact, one of Goodyear’s own licensees engaged in a massive litigation campaign against hundreds of dentists, suing them for royalties on unauthorized uses of rubber dental implants. Similar to the farmers in the late 1880s, this was a patent infringement campaign brought by a patent licensing company against unsophisticated end-users of a new technology. Not only did this occur more than 150 years before today’s complaints about similar litigation practices, it also means that Goodyear would be hit with another pejorative label if he were alive today and engaging in these same licensing practices: “patent privateering” (the practice of selling patents or patent rights to “patent trolls” for the purpose of their bringing lawsuits).\nMany people don’t know any of this because they mistakenly think that Goodyear founded the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. In reality, the company was formed almost four decades after Goodyear’s death and was only named after the famous inventor.\nElias Howe Jr.\nIn the 1840s, Elias Howe Jr. invented and patented the lockstitch mechanism used in sewing machines. Like Goodyear, Howe also licensed his patented innovation for most of his life. Similar to many patent licensing companies today, Howe often entered into royalty agreements only after suing commercial firms that were infringing his patent rights. One historian referred to Howe “suing the infringers of his patent for royalties” as his “main occupation” for “several years.” Howe’s assertion of his patents against noncompliant infringers who refused his licensing offers precipitated the very first “patent war” in the American patent system—similar to the “smartphone war” today, it was even called the “sewing machine war.”\nHowe’s lawsuit tactics were both innovative and the source of much controversy. Since he was destitute when he began filing his mass lawsuits, he found investors to provide third-party financing for his litigation campaign. He also joined the Sewing Machine Combination of 1856, the very first patent pool formed in American history, which successfully ended the sewing machine war. (A “patent pool” is a special corporate entity in which numerous owners of patents that cover a single product license one another so that the product can efficiently be brought to market, such as a sewing machine, a DVD, MPEG video, and thousands of other products brought to market.) Howe’s licensing and litigation practices were criticized in his day; an article in an 1867 issue of the Galaxy magazine stated that “the secret of Mr. Howe’s success” was that “he litigated himself into fortune and fame” (quoted here).\nOther famous 19th-century inventors also extensively licensed their rights in their patented innovations, in addition to engaging in manufacturing and other commercial activities. The list includes, among many others, Samuel Morse (telegraph), William Woodworth (planing machine), Thomas Blanchard (lathe), and Obed Hussey and Cyrus McCormick (mechanical reaper). The specialists who assisted these 19th-century inventors in selling or licensing their patented innovations were known as “patent agents.” Newspapers and magazines were littered with advertisements for their services; here are just two illustrative ads taken from an 1869 issue of Scientific American:\nOf course, today’s innovation economy is vastly different from the 19th-century one. But the myriad business models for bringing patented innovations to the marketplace have not fundamentally changed, including the sale and purchase of patents in secondary markets and the licensing of patented innovations. Such commercial practices continued into the 20th century and continue to this day in such innovative companies as Bell Labs, IBM, Apple, and Nokia, among many others.\nIn fact, the long history of the patent licensing business model and of the secondary markets that made this business model possible is unsurprising. These commercial activities reflect the basic economic principle of the division of labor that Adam Smith famously recognized as essential to a successful free market and flourishing economy—in this context, it is the division of labor between inventors and businesspeople. As award-winning economic historian Zorina Khan has explained, this has been essential to how the patent system has been a driver of America’s innovation economy for more than two centuries. It is concerning that if the rhetoric of today’s patent policy debates were applied consistently, it would require us to condemn great American innovators like Edison, Goodyear, Howe, and many others as “patent trolls.”', 'History teaches us a little-known lesson about innovation: Ideas don’t matter. Good ideas languish all the time.\nWhat matters? Execution. It’s everything—especially, ironically enough, with breakthrough technologies. As the world embraces and demands advances in clean technologies, it’s time to look at what past technology revolutions teach us about the best ways to move clean technology innovations forward.While policymakers in the United States might believe that innovation depends more on ideas than execution, history points to a different lesson. Department of Energy Secretary Steven Chu argued: “Our previous investments in science led to the birth of the semiconductor, computer, and bio-technology industries that have added greatly to our economic prosperity. Now, we need similar breakthroughs in energy.” It was more than spending on science that turned those past ideas into breakthroughs.\nWhile policymakers in the United States might believe that innovation depends more on ideas than execution, history points to a different lesson. Department of Energy Secretary Steven Chu argued: “Our previous investments in science led to the birth of the semiconductor, computer, and bio-technology industries that have added greatly to our economic prosperity. Now, we need similar breakthroughs in energy.” It was more than spending on science that turned those past ideas into breakthroughs.\nExamining history offers several best practices for where and how we should invest as we struggle with the challenge of energy security and climate change—and also indicates that policymakers need to shift their agenda and focus when it comes to energy policies. Consider the trifecta of energy revolutions: electricity, the automobile, and the steam engine. Looking at how these life-altering innovations evolved offer simple yet critical insights for how we must move forward.\n1. Business models are more important than inventions. Edison’s electric light emerged from his Menlo Park research laboratory in 1881,Yet Edison’s original patent application for the electric light was rejected because—as Scientific American reported at the time—“Edison’s invention was an infringement upon that of John W. Starr, of Cincinnati, who filed a caveat for a divisible light in 1845.”\nKnowing this, it is easier to see how Edison’s breakthrough wasn’t the incandescent bulb, it was the business he built around that bulb. Prior to his Pearl Street Station, the market for electricity was limited to those who could afford to buy and maintain entire electric systems. Edison was successful because he built a new business that enabled electricity to be sold like gas — as a utility company.\nTechnical innovations did not spark the emergence and rapid growth of the electricity sector as we know it. That depended on Edison’s new business model, and its ability to bring investors, customers, and partners together in a way that all could profit.\nBusiness model innovations shape the way clean technologies come to market. Without new business models, emerging technologies in the energy sector must compete directly with old ones—as commodities. To supply utility-scale power, solar and wind must now compete with coal and natural gas solely on cost per kilowatt-hour; in transportation fuels, biofuels must compete with gasoline on cost; and energy efficiency must compete with inexpensive grid-distributed energy. Subsidies change relative costs, but don’t change the game.\nNew business models are now emerging that enable clean technologies to take advantage of their distinct differences. While heavy regulations and deeply entrenched players are hampering the development of these new business models, companies like Silverspring, IBM, Google and Cisco, for example, are using their technology and political clout to change the game in smart meters. Until we break down the barriers to new business models, science breakthroughs will remain constrained to press releases and demonstration projects.\n2. Innovation is about connecting, not inventing. When Henry Ford first introduced his Model T, commercial automobiles had been available for more than two decades, but the market had remained relatively small and more for novelty than function.\nThe Model T succeeded because Ford and his engineers built a system of mass production that produced a durable and affordable car. It is important to note though that none of the elements of the Ford system were new—Ford’s success—and his ability to go from building 1,500 cars a year to 265,000—came by combining technologies from the bicycles, carriages, granaries, and meatpacking industries and by exploiting the emerging infrastructure of roadways, gasoline distribution, even railroad supply lines. As Henry Ford admitted: “I invented nothing new. I simply assembled into a car the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work.”\nKnowing this, to see change on the scale needed to seriously address climate change or energy security, clean technology innovation must be able to scale rapidly and without stumbling. Historically, this can only happen when we are able to connect existing and well-developed ideas, people, and technologies in new ways. Policymakers must recognize that clean technology innovation isn’t always about creating something new; often it is about enabling entrepreneurs and innovators to seamlessly connect what already exists.\nThe clean technologies that will scale in the next two decades—like wind power or solar photovoltaics—will only have “breakthrough” impacts by scaling up through new combinations of existing production technologies and established distribution, financing, and infrastructure resources.\n3. Innovation in action. When James Watt “invented” his steam engine in 1762, steam engines had been in use pumping water from coal mines for almost 75 years. However, Watt’s design cut operating costs by 75 percent and, together with businessman Matthew Boulton, Watt began selling replacements for existing engines in coal mines across England.\nWhile the steam revolution emerged in coal mining, its impact was felt in manufacturing, railroads, and shipping. Watt’s actions—particularly his creation of the separate condensor—enabled the broad spread of steam power by opening the path to build faster, lighter, and stronger engines. Watt, however, fought this spread, fearing the inevitable accidents that came from mixing fire, steam, and the industrial settings. Indeed, for the two decades that the Boulton & Watt Company controlled the patents, little innovation took place and few new uses emerged.\nThe real impact of the steam engine came when many entrepreneurs were able to work with the technology, and their collective innovations changed the industrial landscape. Building on Watt’s ideas, companies found valued (and ultimately safe) applications for steam power in ways Watt never imagined.\nMany clean technology paths remain in the research and development phase as scientists search for improvements to make their ideas competitive in large markets. But history shows the most innovative leaps come from the collective creativity and entrepreneurial spirit of dozens, if not hundreds, of companies actively building and using the technology. It’s called learning-by-doing and learning-by-using, and they’re the most valuable lessons of all.\nIf history tells us anything about innovation, it’s that progress will depend on enabling the new business models to tap the ideas we already have; that impact will come when we find ways within these new business models to combine old ideas, people, and technologies in new ways; and that the great leaps will take place after these ideas, as businesses, enter the market and tap the collective creativity and entrepreneurship of free markets.\n(this post originally appeared at www.kauffman.org/advancing-innovation/a-history-lesson-for-the-clean-tech-revolution)']	['<urn:uuid:eb88917b-1609-45d0-94a3-6746df93c7d7>', '<urn:uuid:9c21b7d0-c7d2-4e40-921b-63ab26ac1b63>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	5	110	2795
19	What are the optimal pH ranges for SPS corals and Frogspawn corals?	Both coral types require similar pH ranges for optimal growth. Small-polyp stony (SPS) corals need a pH between 8.1 and 8.4, and Frogspawn corals also thrive in the exact same pH range of 8.1 to 8.4. Both coral types are sensitive to pH fluctuations in their environment.	['Small-polyp stony (SPS) corals are among the most diverse and well-known types of corals found in the world’s oceans – they include many specific kinds of corals from the genera Pocillopora, Montipora and Stylophora. Their skeleton is slowly secreted by the epidermis found at the base of each polyp, and as in the case of LPS (large polyp stony) corals, some varieties can grow much faster than others. The beauty and diversity of SPS corals is maintained in stable habitats, where factors such as temperature, alkalinity and water PH are kept between specific values.\nLarge-Polyp Stony Corals vs. Small-Polyp Corals – The “Great” Divide\nAlthough there is a difference between small-polyp stony corals and LPS corals, there isn’t an actual, concrete distinction between the two. Rather, the transition is smooth, as there are many SPS coral species that have larger polyps, and can often be compared with LPS species. The general difference, however, has to do with the greater fragility and more specific habitat conditions that small-polyp corals may require in order to survive and propagate. In contrast with large-polyp stony corals, they cannot be found at depths where sunlight can’t reach them too easily, nor in waters that are too polluted, murky or cold.\nThe Beauty and Fragility of Small-Polyp Stony Corals\nThere are many beautiful SPS species that are commonly sought out by divers in tropical regions. These include anything from stunning “flowery” patterns like the ones found on Sunset Montipora, and the vibrant purple stem-shaped polyps of the Booberry Acropora, to incredibly exotic, intricate shapes and multicolored textures, such as in the case of the Bisma Worm Rock. Despite their beauty, SPS corals are quite fragile, being commonly attacked by creatures such as nudibranchs and various insects or flatworms that mainly attack Acropora corals. Also, they require specific habitat conditions, such as a temperature between 72 and 78 F, and moderate to intense sunlight.\nThe Preferred Habitats of these Stony Corals\nAside from stable temperature and lighting conditions that can usually only be found in the tropics, small-polyp corals also require several other important factors to be just right, before they can survive. The water alkalinity, for example, has to be between 8-12 dKH, while PH fluctuations of only 0.3 (ideal ranges are somewhere between 8.1 and 8.4) can be tolerated, before the corals begin to find it difficult to maintain their life cycles in the long run. Preferred habitats exist in areas like the islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, including places like Fiji, the Maldives, Hawaii or Papua New Guinea.\nPopular Small-Polyp Stony Coral Varieties\nThe most well-known varieties of SPS corals include primarily members of Acroporidae, including the Montipora and Acropora genera. These corals are most fascinating, not only due to their remarkable natural beauty and diversity, but also because they are the dominant reef building hard coral species of the world’s oceans. Although their diversity makes them extremely prevalent, like most small-polyp stony corals, these species still require specific conditions in order to thrive and survive, which is part of the reason why they are rarely able to live in deeper waters.', 'Euphyllia divisa, better known as the Frogspawn coral is one of the most popular large polyp stony (LPS) coral in the reef hobby alongside its sibling species, Hammer coral (Euphyllia ancora) and Torch coral (Euphyllia glabrescens).\nThe name Frogspawn was coined from its attractive multi-tipped tentacles that bear a striking resemblance to a mass of frog eggs. This coral species is hardy, semi-aggressive, and able to attain rapid growth spurts in favorable water conditions.\nThis article provides an insight into the captive care of Frogspawn corals; these consist of feeding, behavior, placement, care tips, and lots more.\nQuick Notes about Frogspawn Corals\n|Scientific Name||Euphyllia divisa|\n|Tank size (minimum)||30 gallons (~120 liters)|\n|Propagation||Easy to moderate|\n|Optimal Temperature||24 – 28°C (~76°F – 83°F)|\n|Optimal Salinity||SG = 1.023 – 1.025|\n|Optimal PH||8.1 – 8.4|\n|Optimal KH||8 – 12|\n|Nitrate||Less than 20 ppm|\n|Tank placement||Bottom to Middle|\n|Growth Rate||Slow to moderate|\n|Color Form||Brown to tan, green to yellow-green and blue (rare), with cream, pink, lavender or white visible tips at the end of the tentacles|\nOrigin and Taxonomy of Frogspawn Corals\nFrogspawn coral is a large polyp stony coral that belongs to Euphylliidae, a family of zooxanthellate scleractinans. The coral species Euphyllia divisa was first described by Veron & Pichon in 1979. Frogspawn coral can also be referred to as Octopus coral, Grape coral, Honey coral, and Wall coral, and it is related to other renowned LPS corals, namely: Torch coral and Hammer coral.\nSpecies: Euphyllia divisa\nHabitat of Frogspawn Corals\nFrogspawn coral is a species that can be found in a variety of reef regions around the world. They form colonies in reef slopes of fairly deep turbid waters to a depth of 40 m (131 ft) where they enjoy planktonic matter and indirect bright lighting.\nThis coral is naturally domiciled in the Indo-Pacific, Fiji, Australia, Solomon Islands, East China Sea, The Great Barrier Reef, and Ryukyu Islands.\nDescription of Frogspawn Corals\nFrogspawn corals form large colonies with corralite walls that emerge on the outer edges, these corralites are thin and sharp-edged. Some colonies are capable of reaching up to 1 meter (3 ft) in size.\nThis Euphyllia species has very long tentacles when fully extended, they are covered with short branches that are tipped with multiple small rounded knobs. Another prominent feature is the presence of a flabello-meandroid skeleton.\nFrogspawn coral tentacles are thick, lumpy, and long; with some branching into double skeletal or single heads, at the end of these tentacles are brightly colored tips. These polyps have a bubble-like outward appearance that resembles a mass frog spawn (frog eggs).\nA variety of Frogspawn corals is the Euphyllia paradivisa known to hobbyists as the Branching Frogspawn coral. This species is endemic to the waters of the Central-Indo Pacific and American Samoa. Like Euphyllia divisa, it has very long tentacles ending with multiple tipped branches, this variety has a branching/phaceloid skeleton. Branching Frogspawn corals also grow a little bit faster and easier to frag.\nThe color of Frogspawn coral tentacles is usually brown to tan, green to yellow-green, and blue (rare), with cream, pink, lavender, or white visible tips at the end of the tentacles.\nBehavior of Frogspawn Corals\nEuphyllia corals can be quite aggressive when placed in close proximity to other corals, as they tend to battle/compete for real estate in your aquarium. Therefore they should be adequately spaced from other corals in the tank.\nFrogspawn coral is hostile but not to the species in its own genus, however, corals of other genera in the family Euphylliidae are not exempted from this hostility.\nAs observed, the polyps extend during the day and only partially at night. Their sweeper tentacles can extend up to 25 cm in larger colonies when they witness hunger pangs, this poses a threat to nearby corals because of the powerful sting they can deliver.\nSome shrimp species dwelling nearby will enjoy the protection of the Frogspawn coral tentacles by means of commensalism.\nFeeding Frogspawn Corals\nFrogspawn coral has a symbiotic relationship with algae hosting in their tissues, this alga is called zooxanthellae. This specialized feeding mode enables them to feed through the conversion of light into food, the zooxanthellae provide just enough nutrition to sustain itself and the coral.\nAdditionally, the corals will capture planktonic organisms and food particles suspended in the water column, as well as the absorption of organic matter.\nRegardless of the presence and role of the photosynthetic zooxanthellae, they should also be fed live and meaty frozen food. Through supplemental or manual feeding, the corals will grow more vigorously, so don’t assume that the nutrition they get from photosynthesis is enough to make them attain rapid growth spurt and gain enormous mass.\nThey can be fed:\n- mysis shrimp,\n- vitamin-enriched brine shrimp,\n- daphnia or small fish,\n- reef roids (link to Amazon)\nFrozen foods can be thawed to make it easier for the corals to consume them.\nTank Requirements and Water Parameters\nThe minimum tank size for housing Frogspawn corals is 20 gallons (80 L). Opting for a larger tank is even better as it allows for adequate spacing amongst the corals and stability of water parameters.\nWater type, Temperature, Hardness, and pH:\nTemperature: The optimal temperature range for keeping Frogspawn corals is between 76 – 83 °F (24 – 28 °C). Keeping the temperature constant (avoiding fluctuation) is more important than the actual temperature itself.\npH: The ideal pH level is between 8.1 – 8.4. Make sure to keep your tank from experiencing rapid swings in pH.\nHardness: Frogspawn corals will appreciate water hardness value between 8 – 12 dKH.\nAlthough Frogspawn corals can tolerate a wide range of light intensity, including high lighting, they still prefer moderate lighting for best growth and coloration. Output from fluorescent bulbs and LED lighting are enough for the lighting and energy requirements of the corals.\nMetal halides might seem like a good option, but this light source gives off too much heat that is capable of damaging the corals’ tissues.\nNote: The output from LED lighting around 50 – 100 PAR value, is sufficient for the lighting needs of the corals.\nTip: Do not forget that in nature these corals are commonly attached to vertical surfaces. So, place Frogspawn corals at of an angle. If the light cannot reach their branches, they often stop growing and their head do not sprout at all.\nThe water flow should be moderate, not too weak or strong. It should be good enough to keep detritus from collecting on the body of the Frogspawn corals.\nEnsure that the corals do not get hit by direct water flow. It may damage the corals or even make the polyps unable to extend fully.\nNote: Under too low flow Frogspawn corals take on more water to inflate themselves. As a result, there is more space between tissue, it leads to the loss of the coloration, from the visual point.\nCare and Maintenance of Frogspawn Corals\nEndeavor to carry out partial water changes of either 20 – 25% monthly, 10 – 15% bi-weekly, or 5% weekly to maintain good water quality and replenish the required trace elements.\nIn addition, the corals should be inspected frequently, this goes a long way in the timely detection of any damage, infection or unusual changes in their behavior. A sick or unhealthy coral should be separated from the rest, and moved to a quarantine tank for proper treatment, this helps to prevent further spread of infections.\nRegular inspection and a good water change schedule are essential in ensuring good health of the corals and optimal water chemistry. Maintain the following trace elements and compounds in the right proportions to promote the best growth conditions.\nCalcium: Between 400 to 450 ppm.\nMagnesium: 1,250 – 1,350 ppm\nSalinity/Specific Gravity: 1.023 – 1.025\nStrontium: 8 – 10 ppm\nNitrates: < 1 ppm\nPhosphate: < 0.05 ppm\nAmmonia: 0 ppm\nPlacement in the Tank\nPositioning the Frogspawn coral should be subjected to three factors:\n- light intensity,\n- water flow and\n- proper spacing to curb aggression.\nA best practice in housing Frogspawn corals is to abide by the 6-inches (15 cm) rule. Place other corals at least 6 inches away from Euphyllia divisa. An exception to this rule is with other similar Euphyllia species like the Hammer corals, as they will not be harmed by the sweeper tentacles of the Frogspawn coral.\nNote: Even though Torch corals Frogspawn corals are different species of the same genus. Torch corals can be too aggressive towards Frogspawn corals. It is not recommended to keep them together as they tend to compete with other corals for space in the reef tank.\nThe placement of the corals should be subjected to an exercise of trial and error in different areas of the tank till you locate a pleasant spot, they will extend their polyps fully and feed properly when they are situated in a comfortable place.\nAvoid placing the corals in a spot with very fast or direct water flow, this can cause the polyps to retract and hamper on its ability to filter-feed.\nPotential Problems Associated with Frogspawn Corals\nBrown jelly infection: This is a common disease for corals. It is characterized by a jelly-like brown mass that appears to be floating on the surface of the coral. Brown jelly disease is caused by poor water quality or tissue damage, it can lead to rapid tissue necrosis and it is capable of spreading to other corals in the tank.\nSolution: Brown jelly disease can be treated using a broad-spectrum on the infected areas. You should remove the sick colony from the main tank, scrub off and siphon any visible brown jelly. Afterward, treat the sick colony in a freshwater or iodine dip (15ppt), then place the colony in a quarantine tank till it recovers before transferring to the main tank.\nDo not overdose. Use the instructions on the bottle based on your tank size.\nRust brown flatworms: Brown flatworm is an acoel worm prevalent in the reefkeeping hobby. These organisms are tan-brown or rust-colored with a red dot and can reach a quarter of an inch in size. They are characterized by an oval and slightly elongated structure with two tail-like appendages at their posterior.\nRust brown flatworms grow rapidly in aquariums with high nutrient levels, often existing in high populations, they will actively attach to the Frogspawn coral’s body and block light from reaching their tissues.\nSolution: These flatworms can be controlled by maintaining low nutrient levels in the reef tank through the use of carbon, aggressive protein skimming, and increased water flow. Also, proper quarantine of new corals and other fauna before placement will help to minimize the risk of transferring acoels into the tank. They can also be tackled using natural predators like the Blue Velvet Nudibranch (Chelidonura varians) and Wrasses.\nIn addition, an infected colony can be treated by dipping it in a dechlorinated freshwater dip for 5 to 10 seconds (Acoels are sensitive to salinity changes). Before doing that, ensure that the water has a similar pH and temperature as the aquarium water, this is to reduce the amount of stress on the colony.\nMishandling: The corals should be handled with caution during fragging, placement, relocation, or transfer between tanks; that way the risk of soft tissue damage will be highly minimized. Furthermore, shy away from fragging corals with a bone crusher of scissors to avoid splintering into the fleshy polyp area.\nSolution: The use of band saw allows for a safer and precise cutting of the corals when compared to bone cutters and sheers.\nFragging and Propagation Frogspawn Corals\nFrogspawn corals can reproduce through sexual and asexual means.\nIn the wild, they carry out sexual reproduction by releasing gametes into the water, resulting in a fertilized egg which eventually gives rise to a free-swimming planula larva. Afterward, the planula larva will metamorphose to a tiny polyp which begins to excrete calcium carbonate, thus developing into a coral.\nMoreover, Frogspawn corals are capable of reproducing asexually. As seen in reef aquariums, a Frogspawn coral will bud off a small group of polyps with little skeletons present. It usually takes them a few months to turn into full-sized heads.\nThey will also break-off individual polyps in response to stress, these polyps will relocate elsewhere and start a new colony.\nAnother method is through coral fragging. However, it can be a little bit tricky because, as I have mentioned earlier, there are two types of Frogspawn corals: the wall type and the branching type.\nPersonally, I would not recommend fragging the wall type if you do not have the skill to make clean cuts with a bandsaw. The branching type is way more receptive to this process.\nThis process is simple, but you have to be cautious.\n- You should ensure your hands are clean or wear a pair of gloves. Do not touch it with your bare hands. Their stings can cause skin rash for a few days!\n- You will need a decent-sized, healthy, and lively coral for this purpose.\n- Take out the coral and irritate it a little bit, so that it will retract the tentacles. Frogspawn corals are pretty sticky and it is easy to accidentally rip their feeder tentacle off.\n- Using an electric bandsaw, divide the coral into several parts by cutting through it at least 2 inches (5 cm) away from the top.\n- Attach the frag to a coral frag plug or live rock using cyanoacrylate gel or 2-part epoxy adhesive, place them back into the aquarium and provide ample water flow.\nTip: Take a frag plug and put it in the water for a couple of minutes to release the air bubbles that might be in the ceramic frag plug.\nTip #2: Treat the new frags with an iodine solution (for example, Lugol’s solution) to prevent them from contracting diseases, then you can attach them to a live rock before placing them back into the tank.\nThings that you might need depending on your method:\nFrogspawn Corals and Tankmates\nAlso, in the absence of sea anemones, Clownfish are known to host in Frogspawn corals in reef tanks. Is it good? No, it is not.\nClownfish may accidentally damage Frogspawn corals that can cause infections like brown jelly. Basically the same can be said about hermit crabs, crabs, etc.\nFrogspawn corals do not like to be disturbed.\nBuying Frogspawn Corals\nThis hardy LPS coral can be purchased at offline pet stores and from reputable online breeders/vendors as well.\nEndeavor to inspect or enquire extensively to be sure of the coral’s health condition in order not to obtain specimens that may have soft tissue damage.\nA head may cost about $50 – $200 depending on size and other factors.\nFrogspawn corals make for a great addition to reef aquariums. It is adored for a lot of reasons which include fast growth rate, ease of care, attractive colors, and the gentle sway of its long multi-tipped tentacles in the water current.\nThis Euphyllia coral is lively, charming, intriguing, and beginner-friendly. Therefore, it can be easily recommended to get one or two for your reef aquarium.\nTop 10 Corals for Beginners\nHow to Care for Green Star Polyps\nHow to Care for Bird’s Nest Corals\nProper Care for Carpet Anemone\nHow to Care for Zoanthid Corals\nHow to Care for Acan Corals\nHow to Care for Torch Corals\nHow to Care for Hammer Corals\nHow to Care for Elegance Coral\nHow to Care for Duncan Corals\nHow to Care for Bubble Tip Anemones\nHow to Care for Pulsing Xenia\nHow to Care for Ricordea Coral\nHow to Care for Palm Tree Polyp\nHow to Care for Kenya Tree Coral']	['<urn:uuid:0188cd88-89b3-4ca7-996c-d2270ed15854>', '<urn:uuid:093c6046-c81b-4fba-b706-0428e483c065>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	12	47	3136
20	global food processing climate challenges	Climate change and food processing face interconnected challenges globally. The global food trade system is vulnerable to prolonged and severe droughts in major food-producing regions. In Australia, ongoing failure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has negatively affected water security, threatening agricultural production. In Nigeria, the rapid transformation of food systems shows that 75% of consumed foods are purchased, with over 65% being processed. While this creates opportunities for domestic entrepreneurs, it also presents food safety challenges, particularly with aflatoxin contamination in locally processed maize products, requiring urgent regulation and safety standards implementation.	['Deluge & drought: Water security in a changing climate\nAustralia’s water security has already been significantly influenced by climate change. Rainfall patterns are shifting and the severity of floods and droughts has increased.\n- Droughts are becoming more severe due to drier, hotter conditions, leading to declines in soil moisture due to increased water loss from plants and soils.\n- Southeast Australia has experienced a 15% decline in late autumn and early winter rainfall, and a 25% decline in average rainfall in April and May over the past two to three decades. This area includes major population centres of Brisbane, Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and Adelaide.\n- Hotter conditions and reduced rainfall have led to less runoff into streams, rivers, lakes and dams in the southwest and southeast of the continent. In southwest Western Australia, reductions in rainfall, due to climate change, have led to a more than 50 percent decline in streamflow. Across the Murray-Darling Basin, streamflows have declined by 41 percent since the mid-1990s.\n- A warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapour, contributing to an increase in heavy rainfall events and an increased risk of flash flooding.\nThe severe drought being experienced across Queensland, NSW and northern Victoria is being influenced by climate change.\n- The severity of the current drought is being increased by the long-term declines in rainfall and the hotter conditions associated with climate change.\n- Since the mid-20th century, the severity of droughts, such as the Millennium Drought, has also been increased by climate change.\nOn-going failure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from coal, oil and gas, globally and here in Australia, has already negatively affected Australia’s water security and will increasingly affect it into the future.\n- Profound changes to Australia’s water cycle are projected, with increasing threats to our urban water supplies, the agriculture sector and natural ecosystems.\n- Severe droughts are expected to become more frequent, especially across southern Australia, while extreme rainfall events are expected to become more intense everywhere except, perhaps, for the southwest corner of Western Australia.\n- Across southern Australia, cool season rainfall is projected to continue decreasing and time spent in drought is projected to increase.http://ozewex.org/wp-admin/post.php?post=3646&action=edit\n- Less water is likely to be available for agriculture, urban water supplies and ecosystems in coming decades across southern Australia including regions surrounding Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth.\n- A 2°C rise in average global temperatures could lead to an 11–30 percent increase in extreme rain events (wettest day of the year and wettest day in 20 years) across Australia.\nSignificant impacts on and risks to our water security are already evident, and these risks will continue to escalate unless deep and rapid reductions in global greenhouse gas pollution can be achieved.\nHealth: Severe droughts, heavy rainfall and floods all affect our health in many ways – contaminating water supplies, increasing mosquito-borne diseases such as Dengue and Ross River virus, and increasing psychological stress in rural communities.\nAgriculture: Drought has a significant impact on agricultural industries and communities. Severe droughts kill livestock, destroy crops and increase soil erosion, leading to higher food prices and loss of livelihoods.\nWater supplies: Less water is likely to flow into dams in southern Australia as a result of human-driven climate change.\nWater infrastructure: Water related infrastructure, such as water supply reservoirs, dam spillways and river levees, have been designed for historic rainfall patterns. Upgrading this infrastructure to cope with increased flooding and drought, as well as building new infrastructure like desalination plants, is expensive. Over $10 billion has been spent recently on desalination plants to improve water security in our major cities.\nEnergy: Coal, gas and hydro power stations require significant amounts of water and can be negatively affected by drought.\nBushfires: Severe drought leads to higher bushfire risk as shown by the current bushfire season across the southeast of Australia. Changes in land cover due to fire can adversely affect catchment water supplies.\nFlooding: The economic consequences of floods and droughts are significant; the extensive Queensland floods of 2010-2011, for example, cost to the state more than $6 billion (directly).\nPlants, animals and ecosystems: Declining rainfall in southwest Western Australia has affected freshwater fish species. The Murray-Darling Basin has been under considerable pressure, further reductions in rainfall and runoff will make it even harder to rehabilitate degraded aquatic ecosystems, affecting bird and fish life. In 2016 warmer and drier conditions in Tasmania triggered bushfires that severely damaged over 70,000 hectares of western Tasmania’s World Heritage-listed forests and alpine areas.\nIncreasing global water insecurity is becoming a ‘threat multiplier’, with significant implications for Australia and other regions.\n- The worst drought in Syria’s history, likely influenced by climate change, was a factor in triggering conflict and instability in that region, leading to a surge of refugees into Europe.\n- Agricultural systems on the Indian sub-continent are vulnerable to the melting of Himalayan glaciers and instability in the Indian monsoon system, with implications for political and social stability in our region.\n- The global food trade system is vulnerable to prolonged and severe droughts in major food-producing regions, such as the central United States and southeast Australia.\nAustralia’s water security is dependent on action on climate change, particularly on the rapid phase-out of fossil fuels.\n- Australia’s water security is threatened by climate change. Coping with increased frequency and severity of drought and floods is costly and will become progressively more challenging into the future.\n- Continuing on our current trajectory of high emissions has enormous and growing risks.\n- Short-term drought solutions will ultimately be futile without concerted and rapid action to tackle climate change, both here in Australia and globally.\nOriginally published by the Climate Council, 13 November 2018.', 'Aflatoxins Jeopardize Food Safety and Entrepreneurial Food Processing Opportunities in Nigeria\nBy Oyinkansola Tasie, Saweda Liverpool-Tasie, and Elisabeth Paymal\nMaize infected with aflatoxin\nAflatoxin is a toxin produced by mold that grows on crops including peanuts and maize. Hard to detect, it can have devastating impacts on human health, including high risk of liver cancer. Aflatoxins have been observed along the maize value chain in Nigeria: in farm storage, in maize containers during transportation, and in processed maize products. This means that aflatoxins eventually make their way into numerous locally produced and processed maize based food items. With a rapid transformation in modern diets across Africa, we observe higher purchasing of domestically processed and locally produced foods in Nigeria. Data from 2015 reveals that almost 75% of foods consumed are purchased with over 65% of these processed in some form (Liverpool-Tasie et al., 2016). A related study found that domestically processed maize products account for over 80% of the food available at wet markets where the vast majority of Nigerians shop. To ensure that these products are safe for human consumption is therefore critical.\nA research team from Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Food Security Policy is studying aflatoxin presence along the maize value chain in Nigeria. They tested the levels of aflatoxins in three maize products (available in the domestic Nigerian market) in a toxicology laboratory at Michigan State University. The first product was a locally processed and packaged maize cereal (ogi) used as a weaning food and family breakfast cereal across Nigeria. The second was a locally produced custard (made with imported corn starch), and the third, a locally produced cereal product from a multinational food and beverage company. The results revealed that the mycotoxins detected in the locally produced custard and the cereal from the international beverage company were below limit of detection (i.e. less than 2ppb) while the locally produced Ogi had a high level of aflatoxin B1 of 15ppb, much higher than the 2ppb recommended by the Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON). The high level of aflatoxin B1 in the locally produced Ogi could result from high levels of contamination of the maize grain and/or inefficient processing in terms of the fermentation process. This confirms that much more attention needs to be paid to issues of food safety generally and including among processed and packaged foods in Nigeria.\nDomestically produced processed foods are important to the Nigerian national economy as they constitute foreign exchange savings. They also create numerous opportunities for domestic entrepreneurs and farmers, with great agrifood industrialization and commercialization potential. Thus such economic trends are desirable and should be encouraged, the results from this study raise major concerns related to food safety for the Nigerian consumers. This study also shows a need for more research to understand how to handle the levels and growth of aflatoxins along the maize value chain and in maize processed foods. The introduction and enforcement of regulations are urgent to meet food safety and nutrition standards in Nigeria, and should be planned along with the development of domestic food processing.\nOluwatoyin Ademola, Saweda Liverpool-Tasie and Adewale Obadina. 2017.

21	diet feeding habits adult brook trouts	Brook trout will eat virtually anything their mouth can accommodate, including aquatic insect larvae (caddisflies, mayflies, midges, black flies), worms, leeches, crustaceans, terrestrial insects, spiders, mollusks, fish species, frogs, salamanders, snakes and even small mammals like voles. As they grow larger, their diet becomes more piscivorous.	"[""The brook trout are members of the char family. They prefer small spring fed streams and ponds with sand or gravel bottom and vegetation. They spawn over gravel in either streams or lakes, with ground water percolation or in the spring fed areas in lakes. Young brook trout feed on plankton and progress to insects until they are adults.\nBrook trout spawn in late summer or autumn depending on the latitude and temperature (Scott and Crossman, 1985). The type of area required for brook trout spawning is one that offers loose, clean gravel in shallow riffles or shoreline area with an excellent supply of upwelling, oxygen-rich water (LaConte, 1997). Mature fish have been known to travel many miles upstream to reach adequate spawning grounds (Scott and Crossman, 1985). Females are able to detect upwelling springs or other areas of ground-water flow, which make for excellent spawning grounds. Brook trout reach maturity on an average at the age of two and spawn every year, although their size at first maturity depends on growth rate and the productivity of thier habitat (Everhart, 1961). Males often outnumber females at the spawning site, but only rarely is more than one male able to fertilize the eggs in a particular redd (Scott and Crossman, 1985; Blanchfield et al., 2003). The females clear away debris and silt with rapid fanning of her caudal fin while on her side, creating a redd (Scott and Crossman, 1985). The redd is where the eggs will be deposited and fertilized after the males compete for spawning right to the female (Scott and Crossman, 1985). The redd actually resembles a pit that is 4-12 inches in depth (Everhart, 1961). To gain the spawning right of the female the males compete for position by nipping and displaying themselves to the competitor males (Mills, 1971). When spawning is actually taking place the male takes a position to hold the female against the bottom of the redd and both of the fish vibrate intensely while eggs and milt are simultaneously discharged (Scott and Crossman, 1985). Very shortly after this exchange takes place the female works to cover the fertilized eggs with gravel by digging slightly upstream and letting the current carry the gravel down to fill the redd (Everhart, 1961). The eggs are initially adhesive to prevent them from washing away so they are able to incubate within the gravel (Scott and Crossman, 1985). The total time of incubation depends on factors such as temperature and oxygen (Scott and Crossman, 1985). After hatch the fry remain in the gravel until the yolk sac is absorbed then the fry swim up out of the gravel to begin the next stage of their life (Scott and Crossman, 1985). (Blanchfield, et al., 2003; Everhart, 1961; LaConte, 1997; Mills, 1971; Scott and Crossman, 1985)\nBehavior varies greatly in brook trout depending on their habitat; for example, some populations in streams draining into marine environments have individuals that take to living in the marine environment, only returning to the river in order to spawn (Mills, 1971). Brook trout that take to the sea are called sea-run trout, salters, or coasters and are considered anadromous, similar to salmon (Mills, 1971).\nWhile coasters migrate extensive distances to spawn, freshwater populations of brook trout travel comparatively shorter distances upstream (Mills, 1971). The brook trout is one of the least tolerant of competing species of coldwater fishes, it does best in waters where there are no fishes competing for similar niches (Everhart, 1961).\nThere is a relatively high amount of territorial behavior found in brook trout and territory is established shortly after emergence from the redd (Latta, 1968). These territories are established as a result of aggressive behavior (Latta, 1968). Their aggressiveness is shown to increase when factors such as current velocities, availability of food, and the degree of visual isolation heighten (Latta, 1968).\nThe growth rate of brook trout vary depending on their habitat; for example, an individual in a cold spring brook will reach no more than 15.24 cm after four years (Mills, 1971). An individual that inhabits a relatively rich lake habitat may be 38.1-50.8 cm in length and reach weights of around 1.8 kg in the same amount of time (Mills, 1971). The largest brook trout ever caught was a 6.57 kg. individual taken on the Nipigon River in Rabbit Rapids, Ontario (Scott and Crossman, 1985). Brook trout seldom live over 5 years and virtually never beyond 8 years (Scott and Crossman, 1985). The population size of brook trout populations is primarily determined by disease, predation or starvation during the first year of life (Mills, 1971). Brook trout are very specific when it comes to habitat, they require cold, clean, well-oxygenated water and even a seemingly minor change in these conditions can result in the loss of brook trout populations (LaConte, 1997). (Everhart, 1961; LaConte, 1997; Latta, 1969; Mills, 1971; Scott and Crossman, 1985)\nThe brook trout's body is elongate with an average length of 38.1-50.8 cm, is only slightly laterally compressed; the body has its greatest depth at or in front of the origin of the dorsal fin (Scott and Crossman, 1985). Another physical characteristic of the brook trout is an adipose fin and a caudal fin that is slightly forked (Hubbs and Lagler, 1949). The brook trout also has a large terminal mouth with breeding males developing a hook or kype on the front of the lower jaw (Scott and Crossman, 1985).\nIn streams, brook trout can weigh 1 to 5 pounds.\nThe coloration of the brook trout is very distinct and can be spectacular. The back of the brook trout is dark olive-green to dark brown, sometimes almost black, the sides are lighter and become silvery white ventrally (Scott and Crossman, 1985). On the back and top of the head there are wormy cream colored wavy lines known as vermiculations which break up into spots on the side (Scott and Crossman, 1985). In addition to the pale spots on the side there are smaller more discrete red spots with bluish halos (Scott and Crossman 1985). The fins of the brook trout are also distinct; the dorsal fin has heavy black wavy lines, the caudal fin has black lines, the anal, pelvic and pectoral fins have white edges followed by black and then reddish coloration (Scott and Crossman, 1985). (Scott and Crossman, 1985; Hubbs and Lagler, 1949)\nBrook trout can be found in three types of aquatic environments with very specific habitat requirements in each: rivers, lakes, and marine areas. Freshwater populations occur in clear, cool, well-oxygenated streams and lakes with water temperatures that remain below 18.8 C and where there is little to no siltation. Stream dwelling brook trout require habitat that consists of resting areas in pools, feeding sites near riffles or swiftly flowing water, and escape cover that is normally found along undercut banks, under woody debris, trees or large rock ledges. Brook trout that reside in marine environments migrate there from freshwater tributaries and tend to stay close to river mouths.\nA considerable inland body of standing water.\nThe land near a shore.\nOf or relating to the sea.\nA natural body of running water.\nThe food habits of brook trout vary according to their age and life history stage. A brook trout will virtually eat anything its mouth will accommodate, including mostly many aquatic insect larvae such as caddisflies, mayflies, midges, and black flies. Other organisms consumed include worms, leeches, crustaceans, terrestrial insects, spiders, mollusks, a number of other fish species, frogs, salamanders, snakes and even small mammals like voles should they find one in the water. As brook trout become larger their diet shifts more towards a piscivorous one.\nExplore the information available for this taxon's timeline.

22	As a VR cave researcher, I'm curious how modern mapping tech integrates with StarCAVE for visualizing cave data?	The StarCAVE VR system can integrate with modern cave mapping technologies like 3D laser scanners and photogrammetry to visualize cave data. The system uses 34 high-definition projectors powered by nVIDIA chips to display complex 3D images on 360-degree screens, allowing researchers to interact with and navigate through detailed cave visualizations using a tracked wand device. The visualization capabilities can incorporate point cloud data from laser scans and 3D models generated through photogrammetry techniques.	['StarCAVE at CalIT2\nDescription: Fifteen screen virtual reality CAVE with integrated surround sound.\nLocation: CalIT2, University of California, San Diego\nRole: Audio System Consulting and Installation, Sound Spatialization System Design and Development\n- Thomas A. DeFanti\n- Gregory Dawe\n- Daniel J. Sandin\n- Jurgen P. Schulze\n- Peter Otto\n- Javier Girado\n- Falko Kuester\n- Larry Smarr\n- Ramesh Rao\n- Todd Margolis\nThe StarCAVE is a five-sided virtual reality (VR) room where scientific models and animations are projected in stereo on 360-degree screens surrounding the viewer, and onto the floor as well. It was constructed by the UC San Diego division of the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2). At less than $1 million, the StarCAVE immersive environment cost approximately the same as earlier VR systems, while offering much higher resolution and contrast.\nThe virtual-reality environment allows groups of scientists to venture into worlds as small as nanoparticles and as big as the cosmos – permitting new insights that could fuel discoveries in many fields. Early users of the StarCAVE include UC San Diego researchers in biomedicine, neuroscience, structural engineering, archaeology, earth science, genomics, art history and other disciplines.\nCalit2 researchers explore proteins in 3D from the Protein Data Bank, displayed inside the StarCAVE. A research paper about the design and construction of the StarCAVE appears in the current issue of the Elsevier journal, Future Generation Computer Systems (FGCS), and is available online at ScienceDirect.* DeFanti’s co-authors on “The StarCAVE, a Third-Generation CAVE and Virtual Reality OptIPortal,” include Calit2’s Gregory Dawe, Jurgen P. Schulze, Peter Otto, Javier Girado, Falko Kuester, Larry Smarr and Ramesh Rao (all at UC San Diego), as well as Daniel J. Sandin of the University of Illinois at Chicago’s Electronic Visualization Lab (EVL), and Javier Girado (now at Qualcomm, Inc.).\nThe StarCAVE represents the third generation of surround-VR rooms. DeFanti’s team built and named the original Cave Automated Virtual Environment (CAVE) at the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1991. A second-generation model built ten years later at EVL is now the standard surround-VR technology and is widely used around the world and marketed by Mechdyne Corp. The first- and second-generation CAVEs require viewers to wear battery-powered ‘shutter’ glasses; the StarCAVE provides an improved 3D experience and allows viewers to wear only lightweight, polarized ‘sun’ glasses.\nBecause the StarCAVE is designed to help scientists, DeFanti and his team made sure to incorporate the latest in computer graphics processing – using 34 of the newest nVIDIA chips that can generate highly complex images. Thirty-four high-definition projectors (two per screen) create very bright left and right eye visuals, i.e. stereo or 3D, per screen. Each pair of projectors is powered by a high-end, quad-core PC running on Linux, with dual graphics processing units and dual network cards to achieve gigabit Ethernet or 10GigE networking.\nAdding to the virtual reality in the StarCAVE is the surround sound system, which harnesses recent advances in wave field synthesis – a way to maximize the perception of many channels of sound emanating from different sides of the room. Calit2 also worked closely with Meyer Sound, Inc., to customize the installation of three arrays of five conventional high-quality speakers to provide 5.1 surround sound or up to 15 channels of discreet audio diffusion (with a subwoofer channel built into the floor structure).\nUsers of the StarCAVE can interact with the visuals on the 360-degree display – by pointing a “wand” that makes it easy to fly through the 3D images and zoom in or out. The exact position of the wand and the user is determined by a multi-camera wireless tracking system.\nAmong the VR room’s other features, it is wheelchair accessible, and it was designed to withstand earthquakes. One of the StarCAVE’s five walls (along with its six projectors, three screens and three computers) rolls back on steel rails to provide access for users into the space, and the wall rolls back into place to provide the full 360-degree, immersive VR experience.\n- Acclair Art Valuation\n- Active Ecosystem (SMF)\n- Coca-Cola Architectural Projection\n- Exploratorium “Emergence” Architectural Projection\n- Fort Al Jahili Architectural Projection Mapping\n- GlobalLives YBCA Exhibition\n- Our Environment\n- Recombinant Media Labs SF\n- Recombinant Media Labs’ Cinechamber\n- Rusty Air in Carolina\n- San Francisco Symphony 100 Year Anniversary Gala Projection Mapping\n- Shiekh Zayed Grand Mosque Architectural Projection Mapping\n- StarCAVE at CalIT2\n- Westfield Historic Dome Architectural Projection Mapping', 'Explore the intricate world of cave mapping, from advanced technologies to safety considerations. Learn how cave maps contribute to scientific research, navigation, and conservation efforts while overcoming challenges like limited visibility and complex environments.\nCreating cave maps and plans involves a combination of technologies and tools that help capture accurate data about the cave’s features and layout. The process can include both traditional methods and modern technological advancements.

These tools can help in creating detailed maps with annotations, labels, and various layers.\n- Drones: Drones equipped with cameras can provide aerial views of cave entrances and surrounding terrain. This can aid in creating maps that show the cave’s relationship to its environment.\n- Underground GPS and Navigation: Some cave exploration teams use specialized GPS devices designed for underground use. These devices work by sending signals through the cave passages to help explorers navigate and gather accurate location data.\n- Lighting and Photography Equipment: Good lighting is essential for capturing clear photographs and surveying cave interiors. High-quality cameras with low-light capabilities are used to document cave formations and passages.\n- Protective Gear and Safety Equipment: While not technology per se, safety equipment such as helmets, harnesses, and proper clothing are critical for cave exploration, as they ensure the safety of the surveyors.\nThe choice of technologies and tools depends on the complexity of the cave system, the level of detail required in the mapping process, and the available resources. Often, a combination of traditional and modern methods is used to produce comprehensive and accurate cave maps and plans.\nWhat methods are preferred for data collection during cave explorations?\nCave explorations require careful data collection to accurately map and understand the cave systems. The preferred methods for data collection can vary based on the specific goals of the exploration, the complexity of the cave, available technology, and safety considerations. Here are some commonly preferred methods for data collection during cave explorations:\n- Survey Stations and Tape Measurement: This involves setting up survey stations at key points in the cave and using tape measurements to determine distances, angles, and elevations between stations. Traditional compasses and clinometers are often used to measure angles and inclinations.\n- Total Stations and Theodolites: These instruments are used to measure angles and distances more accurately than manual methods. They provide precise measurements for creating detailed cave maps.\n- 3D Laser Scanning: 3D laser scanners capture millions of data points to create a detailed 3D representation of the cave’s interior.

These programs also help manage survey data and maintain consistency in mapping conventions.\n- GPS and GNSS Receivers: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) can be used to mark cave entrances and significant points. Underground GPS devices that communicate through the cave system’s rock can help with navigation and geolocation.\n- Drones: Aerial drones equipped with cameras can provide a bird’s-eye view of cave entrances and terrain, aiding in mapping and understanding the cave’s geographical context.\n- Notebooks and Sketching: Traditional field notebooks and sketching are still valuable methods for recording observations, sketches, and notes about cave formations, passages, and features.\n- Underground Instruments: Instruments specifically designed for underground use, such as clinometers with built-in compasses, can help gather accurate measurements while navigating through tight passages.\n- Data Loggers and Sensors: Data loggers and sensors can be used to monitor environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and airflow within the cave, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the cave ecosystem.\n- Safety and Exploration Gear: Exploration teams must be equipped with proper safety gear, including helmets, harnesses, and adequate lighting to facilitate data collection in challenging cave environments.\nThe choice of methods depends on the specific needs of the exploration and the available resources. Often, a combination of methods is used to ensure accurate and comprehensive data collection, leading to more precise cave maps and a better understanding of the cave system’s characteristics. Safety is always a paramount consideration during cave explorations, so methods that minimize risks to explorers are typically favored.\nWhich specialized techniques are employed to map the intricate structure of cave systems?\nMapping the intricate structure of cave systems requires specialized techniques that can capture the complex geometry, features, and formations found within caves. Here are some specialized techniques employed for mapping intricate cave systems:\n- 3D Laser Scanning: 3D laser scanners emit laser beams that bounce off cave surfaces and return to the scanner, creating a highly detailed point cloud of the cave’s interior. This method captures the intricate shapes of cave passages, formations, and features with high accuracy. The point cloud data can be processed to generate 3D models and maps.\n- Photogrammetry: Using overlapping photographs taken from different angles, photogrammetry software can reconstruct 3D models of cave interiors. This technique is especially effective for capturing the fine details of cave formations and irregular surfaces.\n- Reflective Targets: Placing reflective targets in strategic locations within the cave allows laser rangefinders or total stations to measure distances more accurately. These targets bounce the measurement signal back to the instrument, enhancing precision in data collection.\n- Structure from Motion (SfM): Similar to photogrammetry, SfM involves capturing a series of images from various angles and using software to create 3D models. This technique is particularly useful for mapping cave passages and formations that may not be easily accessible.\n- Multi-Station Traverse Surveys: In complex cave systems, multi-station traverse surveys involve setting up multiple survey stations and measuring angles and distances from each station to others. This method is used to capture intricate networks of passages and connections.\n- Loop Closure Surveys: Loop closure surveys involve returning to previously surveyed points and ensuring that the measurements form a closed loop. This technique helps identify errors in the survey data and ensures accuracy in the mapping process.\n- Cave Diving Mapping: In underwater cave systems, cave divers use specialized equipment to map passages, formations, and features. Techniques like line laying and reel-based measurements help create accurate underwater cave maps.\n- Underground GPS and Wireless Communication: Underground GPS technology and wireless communication systems can help locate survey stations accurately, even in challenging cave environments. This aids in maintaining consistent reference points for mapping.\n- Integration of Sensor Data: Integrating data from various sensors, such as environmental sensors, water flow sensors, and magnetometers, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of cave systems, their hydrology, and potential connections.\n- Data Fusion and Visualization: Combining data from different sources, such as laser scans, photographs, and traditional survey measurements, can lead to more detailed and accurate maps. Advanced visualization tools can help researchers and explorers understand the complex structure more effectively.\n- Modeling of Complex Formations: Specialized software can be used to model and map intricate formations like speleothems (cave formations like stalactites and stalagmites). This requires careful measurement and data processing to accurately represent their shapes.\nMapping intricate cave systems often involves a combination of these techniques to capture the diverse features and complexities present within the cave. The goal is to produce detailed, accurate, and informative maps that contribute to scientific understanding and safe exploration.\nHow are cave maps used not only for scientific research but also for cave safety?\nCave maps serve multiple crucial purposes, ranging from scientific research to cave safety and management. Here’s how cave maps are used in both aspects:\n- Geological and Hydrological Studies: Cave maps provide valuable insights into the geological and hydrological characteristics of cave systems. Scientists can study the relationships between cave passages, formations, and the flow of water, which contributes to a better understanding of the underground environment.\n- Biodiversity Studies: Cave ecosystems are unique and often support specialized flora and fauna. Cave maps aid researchers in identifying potential habitats, niches, and connections that support cave-dwelling organisms. This information is vital for conservation efforts.\n- Climate and Paleoclimate Research: Studying the mineral deposits, sediment layers, and formations in caves can reveal historical climate data. Cave maps help scientists reconstruct past climate conditions and understand climate variability.\n- Speleogenesis Studies: Speleogenesis refers to the formation and development of caves. Detailed cave maps enable researchers to analyze how different processes, such as erosion, dissolution, and sedimentation, contribute to the cave’s formation.\n- Karst Landscape Studies: Cave maps are integral to studying karst landscapes, which are characterized by sinkholes, underground drainage systems, and cave networks. Understanding these landscapes helps geologists, hydrologists, and ecologists manage resources and mitigate hazards.\n- Navigation and Exploration: Cave maps are essential for safely navigating complex cave systems. Explorers and cavers use maps to plan routes, avoid getting lost, and ensure they can find their way back to the entrance. This is especially crucial in large, intricate caves.\n- Emergency Preparedness: In case of accidents, cave maps aid rescue teams in locating and accessing cavers quickly and efficiently. Detailed maps can include information about potential hazards, escape routes, and access points.\n- Risk Assessment: Cave maps help assess potential risks associated with specific cave passages, such as unstable formations, tight squeezes, or flooded areas. This information is important for determining which areas are safe to explore and which require specialized equipment or training.\n- Conservation and Protection: Cave maps aid in identifying areas of ecological sensitivity. By knowing where fragile formations or sensitive habitats exist, cave managers and explorers can take measures to minimize their impact and protect the cave’s unique features.\n- Resource Management: For caves with commercial or recreational use, maps are essential for managing visitor traffic, preventing overcrowding, and maintaining a sustainable balance between exploration and conservation.\n- Access Control: Cave maps can be used to manage access to sensitive or fragile areas within caves. By restricting access to certain passages, cave managers can prevent accidental damage and preserve the cave’s natural state.\nIn essence, cave maps are indispensable tools that serve not only as scientific records but also as critical resources for safe exploration, conservation, and management of cave systems. They help strike a balance between the need for scientific understanding and the imperative to protect these fragile and unique underground environments.\nWhat are the challenges and limitations encountered in the process of cave mapping?\nThe process of cave mapping is complex and often fraught with challenges and limitations due to the unique nature of cave environments and the technical difficulties involved. Some of the key challenges and limitations encountered in the process of cave mapping include:\n- Inaccessible Areas: Many cave systems contain passages that are too narrow, too flooded, or otherwise inaccessible to human explorers. Mapping such areas requires specialized equipment and techniques, such as remote-operated vehicles (ROVs) or cave diving, which come with their own set of challenges.\n- Navigation Difficulties: Navigating through the labyrinthine passages of a cave can be extremely challenging, leading to confusion and the potential for getting lost. This challenge is compounded in large, complex cave systems.\n- Limited Visibility: Many caves are completely dark or have limited natural light, making it difficult to accurately measure distances, angles, and features. Explorers rely on artificial lighting, which may not provide consistent or adequate illumination for precise mapping.\n- Technical Equipment Limitations: The use of technical equipment like laser scanners, total stations, and cameras can be hindered by factors such as battery life, signal interference, and the need for specialized training to operate these tools effectively.\n- Data Integration: Combining data from different sources, such as laser scans, photographs, and traditional survey measurements, can be challenging. Ensuring data accuracy and alignment during integration is critical for creating coherent and accurate cave maps.\n- Time-Consuming Process: Mapping intricate cave systems is time-consuming and requires meticulous attention to detail. This can lead to extended fieldwork periods, especially when mapping large or complex caves.\n- Survey Errors: Even with advanced equipment, errors can occur during the survey process. Small inaccuracies in measurements, misalignment of instruments, or surveying mistakes can lead to distorted maps and inaccurate representations.\n- Environmental Considerations: Caves often harbor delicate formations that can be damaged by human presence. Surveyors need to take great care not to disrupt these formations while collecting data, which can slow down the mapping process.\n- Scale and Perspective: Translating the three-dimensional reality of caves onto two-dimensional maps can distort scale and perspective. This can make it challenging to accurately represent the true dimensions and relationships within the cave.\n- Lack of Reference Points: In the absence of clear reference points like geographic landmarks, mapping cave systems can be more challenging. Establishing reliable reference points for accurate positioning can be difficult, especially in remote areas.\n- Communication Challenges: In caves with limited or no wireless communication, transmitting data in real-time can be problematic. This can hinder the ability to receive guidance or assistance from experts outside the cave.\n- Safety Concerns: The safety of cave explorers is paramount. Technical challenges and the potential for unexpected hazards, such as cave-ins or flooding, can pose risks to surveyors and limit their ability to thoroughly explore and map certain areas.\nDespite these challenges, advancements in technology and surveying techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and comprehensiveness of cave mapping. Researchers and explorers continue to develop innovative solutions to address these limitations and expand our knowledge of the intricate world beneath the surface.']	['<urn:uuid:96f21aff-ba9a-4e0d-a15a-0dd6d2521449>', '<urn:uuid:10dc5356-b30d-47ad-a829-71483faabba4>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	18	73	3265
23	What's the main difference between fog-dependent coastal ecosystems and littoral forests?	Fog-dependent coastal ecosystems rely on moisture from fog for survival, particularly redwood forests which get 30-40% of their water from fog during dry seasons, allowing them to thrive in otherwise dry summers. In contrast, littoral forests are adapted to brackish water conditions in deltas, estuaries and creeks affected by tides. These coastal forests, including mangroves, can survive in both fresh and salt water environments, providing useful resources like fuel wood and durable timber.	"[""by Kyle Pinjuv\nFog: Some embrace the cool reprieve it offers from hot summer temperatures. Some feel betrayed by its presence as they approach the beach in shorts and a tank-top with summery intent only to be forced to spend the day wrapped in a towel shivering in a cloud. Fog limits your vision and inspires the creative mind. It reduces contrast during movement, changing our perception of reality and literally causing us to move differently through space. It moves border-free without discrimination over land and sea. We cannot own it or control it. The fog is the San Francisco Bay Area’s breath. It is the gift that allows our iconic redwood forests to flourish. It is itself a coastal icon.\nFog along the coastal belt is a result of our region’s unique geography, ocean currents, wind and air temperature both inland and offshore. It all begins as the spring sun warms the Central Valley of California: The heated air rises creating a low pressure system along the ground in the Valley, while at the same time, warm air moves north from the equator over the cool Pacific Ocean creating a high pressure system. The high pressure is then pulled inland toward the low pressure, balancing the two systems. While this balancing act is occurring, wind from the northwest, full of moisture gathered while traveling over thousands of ocean miles, comes into contact with the cold upwelled waters off the California coastline. The air is cooled, causing moisture to form into visible droplets. Eventually, the accumulation of billions of these drops occurs and produces what we call fog. The fog is pulled with the balancing high and low pressure systems from the coast as far inland as the Central Valley.\nThis complex process of fog formation is part of a larger ecological process that allows our beloved coastal redwood habitats to thrive. Summer is the growing season for coastal redwoods and they rely on the cool, moisturized air to collect water in an otherwise dry season. Approximately 30–40 percent of the water supply used by redwoods comes from fog. With the trees’ great height, they rely on pulling moisture both from the ground and from the air. Redwoods are one of only a few tree species that can move water in both directions. The fog also contributes to the greater coastal redwood ecosystem by soaking the ground up to 35 centimeters deep!\nThere have been studies throughout Northern California looking at how climate change reduces the differential of air and ocean temperatures resulting in the decrease of total days of fog per year. Without the fog, coastal redwoods are more vulnerable to drought and die back at the tops of the trees. With the drying of soils and hot summer temperatures, redwood seedlings are especially susceptible to drought conditions. Many organizations and agencies will be keeping a close eye on fog reduction as it has the ability to greatly impact our coastal ecosystems.\nWe are so often grateful for the landscapes of Sonoma County — and rightfully so — but every so often it is important to take a broader view of why this region’s land is so special. Many times, the outside forces that know no political boundaries, such as the wind, rain and fog, allow this region to flourish. It is our duty as stewards of the land to not only protect that which can be bought and sold, but also to care for our seas and our air. Take away the health of our shared planetary resources and we are left with little to protect.\nKyle Pinjuv is the stewardship associate project manager at Sonoma Land Trust.\nSonoma Land Trust is a local nonprofit based in Santa Rosa, CA, that conserves scenic, natural, agricultural and open lands in Sonoma County for the benefit of the community and future generations. This blog focuses on SLT's stewardship team, whose members do hands-on work to directly protect, restore, and safeguard the land for generations to come."", 'Table of Contents\n- 1 Forests – Natural Vegetation of India\n- 2 Classification of Natural Vegetation of India\n- 3 Moist Tropical Forests\n- 4 Dry Tropical Forests\n- 5 Montane Sub-Tropical Forests\n- 6 Montane Temperate Forests\n- 7 Alpine Forests\nForests – Natural Vegetation of India – Classification of Natural Vegetation of India: Moist Tropical, Dry Tropical, Montane Sub-tropical, Montane Temperate, Alpine Forests.\nForests – Natural Vegetation of India\n- Climate, soil and topography are the major factors that influence Natural Vegetation of a place.\n- The main climatic factors are rainfall and temperature.

24	how cylinder arm sewing machines work for bag making and what insurance coverage needed for small sewing business	A cylinder arm sewing machine has a cylinder-shaped arm extending horizontally from the main body with the needle positioned at the very end, making it ideal for leather bag making by providing space underneath to manipulate large bags. For a sewing business, general business liability insurance would cover lawsuits involving injuries at your place of business, product-related issues, and copyright infringement. However, additional coverage like workers compensation for employee injuries and professional liability coverage may be needed.	['Before I get into my very first ‘serious’ blog post about making handbags, I wanted to take the opportunity to say how grateful and overwhelmed I am for all the support I’ve received on my venture into blogging! You guys are seriously awesome, thank you so much for coming along on this journey with me into the unknown!\nSo moving on….my first post. This post is for Vicky, who messaged me last week to ask about sewing machines for bag making. There are many and varied tools you need for bag making but the key one you need is the sewing machine…..\nI originally published this post and it was MASSIVE – you seriously needed one, maybe even two cups of coffee, to get through it! So I’ve now broken it up into three, more manageable parts.\nPART 1: Sewing Machines for Bag Making… is a great starting point. I talk generally about the different types of machines and what they are called and introduce you to what I use for bag making. This part continues below.\nPART 2: What Bag Making Sewing Machine for me?…. picks up on your new basic knowledge of different sewing machines used for bag making. It includes considerations you need to make about which machine is going to suit you, your general sewing goals, space availability and finances….all of which are relevant when deciding on a machine to suit you best. If you are looking for this, please click here.\nPART 3: Buying a Bag Making Sewing Machine… having considered and identified what machine suits you and your bag making goals, it’s now time to go and test drive. Part 3 gets you ready to go and test drive, and arms you with things to take with you, what to look for and questions to ask. If you are ready to purchase a machine and are looking for this post, please click here.\nSo here we are, at the beginning and what are the different machines in bag making. Read on…\nBAG MAKING SEWING MACHINES:\nFor me, the Cylinder Arm is the most ideal sewing machine you can use for leather bag making. It is industrial machines that go by this name and it’s called at Cylinder Arm because of the cylinder shaped arm that extends out horizontally from the main body of the machine. With a Cylinder Arm, you will also find the needle is positioned right at the very end of the arm. At university in the handbag making rooms, all but a few machines were Cylinder Arms. These are ideal, particularly for making large handbags, with the amount of space available underneath the horizontal arm to manipulate the bag around while sewing. Some Cylinder Arms will also come with part of the table cut out allowing you to sew even larger bags.\nMy Pfaff 335 Cylinder Arm Machine with Walking Foot, who I call Percy\nAs the name suggests, the sewing area of the Flat Bed machine is flat. This machine is typically built into the table so it’s all one flat surface. Larger bags can still be made on this machine but it will need more manipulation, and depending on the type of bag and how they are constructed, some areas you won’t be able to get into with a flatbed. More consideration will need to go into what bags you make and how you make them, in order to do them from beginning to end on a Flat Bed.\nPfaff 135 Flat Bed\nThe last type of sewing machine for bags is a Post Bed. Again this is a name used for industrial machines and it is called this for the single arm that stands upright on the machine like a fence post. Traditionally a Post Bed machine is used in footware manufacture, but they are also very useful in bag making as they can get into some very tight corners that you wouldn’t be able to get into with the Cylinder Arm or Flat Bed. Indeed there are some bag makers that make entire bags with a Post Bed machine and prefer them over other machine types, it’s all a matter of preference.\nMy Pfaff 191 Post Bed Machine with Roller Foot, affectionately known as Patsy\nAll of the above machines can be used exclusively for making bags. However, having a combination machine opens up more options in your bag making. The most common combination machine is a Cylinder Arm and a Flat Bed, and there are three ways they can be achieved.\n1) The most common way is with a domestic table-top sewing machine. These machines have a flat area, smaller compared to a dedicated Flat Bed machine, but still big enough to hold most sewing projects flat. Then by removing the storage compartment, a ‘free arm’ will be revealed. This arm will be more square, the needle will be position further in on the free arm and the distance between the bottom of the arm and the table will be smaller than a dedicated Cylinder Arm machine….. but with some manipulation, it will still allow you room to manoeuvre larger bags around the machine. An additional table top attachment can also be purchased and added to make a larger flat service for sewing.\nBrother NS30 Domestic Sewing Machine – Flat Bed to Free Arm to table top Extension\n2) The next way is to use a specially designed sewing table or sewing cabinet for a table top domestic machine. These sewing tables and cabinets have a lever system, where the machine can be positioned in two locations, therefore making a Flat Bed or a Cylinder Arm equivalent. Locking the lever, where the top of the machine is level with the top of the table, a Flat Bed machine has been made. An extra extensions can also be purchased to close up any gaps between the table and the sewing machine. The machine can also be completely raised so the base of the machine is at table top level, just as it would be if you didn’t have a cabinet and were sewing on the dining room table. Remove the storage compartment to access the free arm and again you will have two machines in one.\nA Horn Sewing Cabinet ‘Cub Plus’, in a flat bed position (with extension)\nHorn Sewing Cabinet ‘Cub Plus’ in a table top position.\n3) Lastly you can convert your industrial Cylinder Arm to a Flat Bed through a table top extension for your Cylinder Arm. This table top will fit around the arm and lock into place, providing you with a large flat work area. With a little bit of searching, you can find this attachment to purchase for your type of machine, or if you are clever enough you can make it yourself.\nA purchased Cylinder Arm table top extension\nA home-made Cylinder Arm table top extension\nSEWING MACHINES I USE\nI sew bags combining different leathers and fabrics, and I am fortunate enough to have a dedicated studio for making my bags. My handbag making studio is made up of:\n- Industrial Cylinder Arm (Pfaff 335), with a walking foot;\n- Industrial Post Bed (Pfaff 191), with a rolling foot;\n- Very basic table top domestic machine, (Brother NS30), with flat-bed attachment;\n- Domestic overlocker (Brother 3034D).\nIn addition, I have a leather Skiving Machine in the studio and another domestic Brother NS30 sewing machine that I keep at home for odd jobs. The only machines I purchased new were one of the Brother NS30’s and the overlocker….all the rest were second-hand.\nI don’t have an industrial Flat Bed machine. Instead, I have crafted my own table top extension to fit around my Cylinder Arm, converting it to a Flat Bed. I’ve done this with a cardboard box, which is a cheap and very effective option. It’s only now, after having the machine for 10 years, that I’ve had to re-do my cardboard box flat bed extension as the sticky tape gave out!\nMy cardboard table top Flat Bed extension for my Cylinder Arm Machine\nNow in terms of what I use most for bag making, I use my Cylinder Arm (with and without cardboard box extension) 85% of the time, table top domestic 10%, Post Bed 4% and lastly the overlocker 1% of the time. As you can see – a big fan of the Cylinder Arm!\nAll my leather work is done on either the Cylinder Arm or Post Bed – depending on the design of the bag and which machine is the best fit. I use my domestic machine to make all the bag linings, as the Cylinder Arm and Post Bed would just make a mess of the cottons I use in the linings. The Overlocker is for the linings as well.\nAnd that’s where I’ll cut Part 1 off, with a basic knowledge of the different types of sewing machines used in Bag Making and which machines I use. Part 2 continues after this with what considerations you need to make when purchasing a machine for making handbags.\nUntil then, have a wonderful day and happy sewing.', 'What Is (And Isn’t) Protected Under Business Liability Insurance?\nBusiness Liability Insurance covers the basic risks associated with conducting business. Liability coverage refers to general items and not specific to unique business activities. Every business needs coverage but it is equally necessary to understand what coverage each plan offers and whether it is enough for your specific industry. Your Lyndhurst NJ insurance agent will be invaluable in determining the individual needs of your business. Not having the right kind of coverage, or lack of coverage may leave your business vulnerable to lawsuits and potential bankruptcy.\nWhat Is Covered By A General Business Insurance Policy?\nA general business insurance policy covers your business, your employees and yourself from lawsuits involving the business. Whether your business is being sued for an injury sustained in your place of business, caused by an employee or as a result of your product or service, Business Liability Insurance will cover it. Business Liability Insurance can also cover things like copyright infringement.\nBusiness liability insurance helps to mitigate the risk of losing money, or your business, due to legal action, whether that be from personal injury, property damage or intellectual damages. However, as with all other policy types, Business Liability Insurance has caps that may not cover the entire amount due. This is why it is important to have a risk assessment performed prior to choosing an insurance policy.\nWhat Is Not Covered By Your Business Liability Insurance Policy?\nA common misconception is that General Business Liability Insurance covers employees injured on the job… it doesn’t. New Jersey law requires business owners to have Workers Compensation coverage. Additionally, professional errors such as negligence, malpractice or misrepresentation will not be covered by a general Business Liability Insurance policy. Lastly, events such as car accidents, intentional acts and product failures that would be typically covered by a warranty are not covered by general business liability insurance. As a result, you may want additional coverage for any of the items not covered by your policy.\nIn addition to circumstance-specific policies like Workers Compensation and Car Insurance, it is important to evaluate the potential costs of damages following an accident. Business Umbrella Insurance is a policy that helps to pay any leftover amount in a lawsuit that is not covered by Business Liability, Workers Comp or Commercial Auto Insurance. This extra coverage helps to prevent major loses and even bankruptcy in the event of a large, substantial insurance claim.\nAdditional Insurance Coverage For Your Business May Include:\n- Automobile Insurance\n- Equipment Breakdown Coverage\n- Business Interruption Insurance\n- Electronic Data Loss Insurance\n- Data Breach Coverage\n- Professional Liability Coverage\nBusiness owners should have a solid understanding of what is included and not included with insurance policies. An experienced NJ insurance agent is instrumental in ensuring that you have the information and the coverage your business needs to be protected. Furthermore, take the time to evaluate your insurance annually.

25	I'm thinking about a career in healthcare and wonder what kinds of training tools they use nowadays - can you tell me about some innovative ways they're teaching medical procedures?	Modern healthcare training uses several innovative tools, including high-fidelity anatomical replicas created with 3D printers, medical training mannequins, and virtual reality simulators. For example, some facilities use ultra-realistic practice models like articulated infant arms for arterial line placement training, or specialized trainers for practicing procedures like gunshot wound treatment and fingernail procedures. These can be used either in face-to-face training or in digital simulation scenarios.	['Walking into the SIMPeds Engineering Studio, a few blocks from Boston Children’s Hospital, the first thing you notice is body parts — high-fidelity replicas of human anatomy in various sizes. Some are in a glass display case, while others are laid out in various states of assembly, from a lone finger to the complete abdominal cavity of a newborn, packed with diminutive organs. Six newborn-sized, hollow duodenums, cast in rubber over a plastic mold, hang ready near a workbench.\nThese aren’t your usual medical mannequins.\nIn the adjoining InventorSpace, three 3D printers stand ready to fabricate additional custom parts. Some will be used by surgeons to rehearse an upcoming complex operation. Others are used for general training and preparedness purposes. A collaboration with the special effects company Fractured FX helped launch the first trainers; today there are more than 20 in various stages of development. They allow practice of rare or infrequently performed procedures as well as some common ones that pose challenges in children.\nKnowing the nose\nThis Pediatric Nasal Foreign Body Extraction trainer was created to prepare emergency department (ED) clinicians for a common but stressful scenario: Junior has put something up his nose. Crafted from CT images, it replicates the complex, narrow passages of a child’s nasal airway and fits all standard extraction tools. “If you get the muscle memory, you don’t have to worry about getting it right when you have a squirming, crying child,” explains simulation engineer Greg Loan.\nNot your average doll arm\nFully articulated arm, wrist and hand bones lie beneath the soft rubber on this Radial Access trainer. Clinicians will be able to feel for a pulse (pump shown at left) and practice positioning the wrist to guide a cannula into the radial artery. “Radial arterial line placement is a technically difficult and often very painful procedure, and is performed on some of our smallest, most fragile patients,” says pediatric hospitalist Debra Hillier, MD, the project’s clinical champion. “Access to an infant-specific, just-in-time ultra-realistic trainer will enable clinicians to practice the procedure as though they were working on a real arm.” The arm can be attached to standard mannequins, replacing their unbendable, doll-like arms. The model also includes the ulnar artery, replicating the arm’s blood circulation pattern.\nZip-on trauma practice\nThis Gunshot Wound Trainer helps Boston Children’s Trauma Team rehearse emergency care. It zips onto the standard SimJunior mannequin and allows clinicians to practice chest tube placement in the presence of heavy bleeding (enough to require transfusion) and a collapsed lung. A section of ribs underneath the skin (shown at left) enables clinicians to practice finding the correct intercostal space for tube insertion. “Gunshot wounds are an excellent example of a high acuity, low frequency event,” says David P. Mooney, MD, MPH, who co-leads trauma simulations at the hospital. “The level of realism in this trainer puts the clinicians in the mindset that they are working on a live patient.”\nThis Neonatal Abdominal trainer, still under development, is specifically designed to help surgeons practice treating duodenal atresia. In this congenital malformation, the duodenum (first portion of the small intestine after the stomach) is blocked, causing vomiting and inability to feed. It’s rare enough that most surgeons never have the opportunity to practice the corrective operation. The trainer allows surgeons to identify the duodenal atresia (see the whitish organ in the middle) and perform the operative repair with haptic feedback. It was created in collaboration with surgeons Biren P. Modi, MD, MPH, and Jill Zalieckas, MD, MPH.\nTaking the trepidation out of trephination\nThis Fingernail Trephination and Nailbed Laceration trainer reproduces what happens when a finger is subjected to trauma: Blood pools beneath the nail, causing a bruise, and sometimes the skin under the nail can split. The model enables emergency clinicians to practice nail trephination, a procedure that involves making a hole in the fingernail to drain the pooled blood and then sealing off the wound (which continues to “weep” until closed). The removable fingernail also allows practice in repairing tears in the nailbed.\nThe thigh bone’s connected\nThis Pediatric Femur Fracture trainer fits onto the standard SimBaby mannequin. It reproduces the angry bruise that signals fracture of the thigh bone. When you manipulate it, you can feel the crackly sensation that indicates a broken bone.\nCath port confidence\nThis Wearable Power Port trainer is designed to give nurses confidence inserting needles into children’s implanted Port-a-Caths (housed in the assembly at right) to provide IV medications, fluids and nutrition. Because the trainer can be strapped on, actors or staff members can pose as uncooperative patients during the simulations. “In our environment, the pediatric ED, accessing ports in young patients is stressful both physically and psychologically, not only for the patient and family, but also for the nurse,” explains nurse educator and project champion Denise Downey, RN. “The nurse must follow strict policy guidelines and sterile technique in the setting of an often frightened, uncooperative child along with very close observation by parents under stress.” Downey expects to use the device to train approximately 110 nurses annually; they perform some 50 to 60 port accesses every month.\nFabrication at their fingertips\nEach trainer represents a close collaboration between clinicians and SIMPeds simulation engineers Greg Loan, Andrew Hosmer, Katie Livingston, Noah Schulz, Mariah Geritano, Duncan Smith-Freedman and Reimi Yonekura. Maeve Geary, a PhD candidate from Bolton University (U.K.), also contributes to the designs.\nPlenty of new trainers are on the drawing board or in the early stages of construction. While priority for custom trainers is given to clinicians at Boston Children’s, outside requests will be entertained. “We have seven engineers and a large capacity for fabrication,” says Melissa Burke, director of Business Development for Boston Children’s Simulator Program.\nFor more information, to view a trainer or to inquire about making a custom trainer, email Melissa.Burke@childrens.harvard.edu.', 'HEALTHCARE TRAINING THROUGH SIMULATION: PRACTICE TO LEARN BETTER\nHealthcare simulation, you’ve probably heard about it before: it’s a pedagogical approach that allows learners to experience situations that are extremely close to reality, and thus represents a particularly interesting complement to traditional early and continuous health training.\nLet us look together at the objectives, interests and above all good practices of this method, now considered essential in the field of healthcare.\nHealth simulation: what is it about?\nWhat is health simulation?\nHealth simulation is a training method that consists of artificially reproducing realistic care situations or environments to not only learn diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, but to discover the best ways to react, communicate and make decisions.\nIt can be carried out entirely at a distance – either purely digitally, or presented face-to-face alongside the digital component and may require the use of accompanying support materials or technologies such as:\n- Medical training manikin,\n- a standardised or simulated patient,\n- a simulator,\n- virtual reality.\n…and is based on the implementation of simplified or complex scenarios using a simulation technique such as a role-playing game, procedural or patient simulator, a serious game or utilising augmented or virtual reality.\nWhat are the objectives of the health simulation?\nThe objective of this method is to be able to practice specific technical skills and/or procedures repeatedly, to practice clinical, diagnostic and/or therapeutic reasoning, to train how to manage certain behaviors (professional situations, teamworking, communication, etc.), or to deal with particular clinical situations, such as an unforeseen event or an emergency, etc.\nWhy do you practice health simulation?\nA health simulation provides many benefits and allows medical and paramedical professionals who undergo face-to-face or digital training to:\n- be able to experience a wide variety of situations, including so-called “patient-risk” situations;\n- Improve their ability to cope, by participating in scenarios that can be repeated;\n- retain information better, by putting theory into practice and training in situations very close to reality;\n- access new support equipment, to learn simple or complex\nA face-to-face also allows a learner:\n- To observe and analyse their practices and behaviours as well as their interactions with each other;\n- to learn how to work as a team.\nThe conduct and best practices of a simulation session\nA simulation session responds to a specific methodology and must thus take place in a pre-established pattern that includes three distinct phases: the briefing, the simulated session and finally the debriefing.\n1. The briefing\nThe general briefing is an important step that allows the trainer to specify the framework of the simulation session and its objectives. This is crucial for:\n- recalling educational objectives\n- presentation of the general context and conditions of the simulation (overall scenario, initial patient condition, history, evolution of the patient’s clinical condition, etc.);\n- the presentation of the environment (configuration of premises, actors in attendance, etc.)\n- learners’ familiarity with the support materials and/or technologies used;\n- the to recap the rules, covering ethics, principles of confidentiality (especially for video recording), with non-judgmental approach.\nIn general, the goal for the trainer is to put learners at ease and to create an environment conducive to learning. The briefing thus allows the simulation session to be conducted and the debriefing prepared.\nIn an e-learning simulation, the briefing will also be present and will “set the scene”. It will be proposed, not by the trainer, but by a narrator or by the hero or other characters in the simulation.\n2. The simulation session\nOnce the briefing is complete, the simulation session begins according to the predetermined scenario.\nDuring the session, learners “play their own roles” in the face of a specific situation and are guided by the trainer. The trainer is responsible for changing the scenario according to the reactions of the learners and to also evaluate them. In addition, a trainer can also intervene, as the “facilitator”, to help learners who find themselves stuck in a difficult situation, or to avoid them moving into a situation of failure, not foreseen in the scenario.\nNote that the trainer can be virtual, i.e., integrated into the scenario, by writing pre-established feedbacks. In this situation the simulation could be completed alone as self-training.\nDebriefing (which follows the simulated session) is the best time for analysis and synthesis and consists of three phases:\n- the descriptive phase is an opportunity for learners to take a step back and discuss the session that has just taken place, collectively express their feelings, verbalize the facts, evaluate their choices, their actions and intentions;\n- the analysis phase provides learners, with the help of the trainer, to propose an analysis of the actions and practices carried out (or not carried out) during the simulated situation;\n- finally, during the synthesis phase, the trainer carries out an overall summary of the session, and provides feedback to the learner/s, in line with his/her expertise.\nDebriefing is therefore a key stage (its duration is usually at least equal to that of the simulation), as it is the critical moment of learning and reflection in response to the simulation session.\nThis debriefing can also be set up as self-training in the form of a completely virtual simulation. It is designed by the teaching teams beforehand and takes into account the learner’s choices during the experiment. Trainers may in this phase propose that learners go back to certain stages or activities to retry their attempt.\nAs you can see, a health simulation can allow someone to learn how to best manage themselves in an important situation (especially a high-risk one) by recreating it identically, and in as much detail as necessary, but without any danger to the patient. It is therefore an original, attractive and particularly effective educational tool, aimed at all professionals in the field of healthcare, especially animal healthcare… provided that certain good practices are followed!']	['<urn:uuid:07eefc1d-5e4c-468f-b078-5167a52d0752>', '<urn:uuid:4eaea129-fe93-4b4f-8c25-5ddc46970a44>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	30	65	1948
26	compare cognitive restructuring techniques exposure therapy first responder mental health case studies studying trauma intervention methods	Cognitive restructuring and exposure therapy are two distinct approaches used in CBT for first responders. Cognitive restructuring involves identifying and challenging negative thought patterns, examining evidence for and against thoughts, and reframing them in a more positive and realistic way. For example, changing thoughts like 'I'm not good enough' to 'I'm doing the best I can in a difficult situation.' Exposure therapy, on the other hand, involves gradually exposing the first responder to stressful or anxiety-provoking situations in a safe and controlled environment to help them overcome their fears. This is similar to systematic desensitization, where patients work through a hierarchy of fears while maintaining a relaxation response. Both techniques can be effective for managing stress and trauma, but they target different aspects - cognitive restructuring addresses thought patterns, while exposure therapy focuses on behavioral responses to anxiety-provoking situations.	"['Overview of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychotherapy that is often used to help first responders cope with stress and trauma. CBT is based on the idea that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected, and that changing our thoughts and behaviors can help us to better manage our emotions and stress.\nIn CBT, a therapist works with the first responder to identify negative or inaccurate thought patterns and behaviors that may be contributing to stress or anxiety. The therapist then helps the first responder to develop more positive and effective ways of thinking and coping.\nSome common techniques used in CBT include:\n- Cognitive restructuring: This involves identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and replacing them with more positive and realistic ones.\nExposure therapy: This involves gradually exposing the first responder to stressful or anxiety-provoking situations in a safe and controlled environment to help them overcome their fears.\nBehavioral activation: This involves helping the first responder to identify and engage in activities that bring them joy and a sense of accomplishment.\nRelaxation training: This involves teaching the first responder relaxation techniques such as deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation to help them manage physical symptoms of stress and anxiety.\nCBT is often conducted over a series of sessions, and the first responder may be given ""homework"" assignments to practice the techniques they learn in therapy. CBT has been shown to be an effective treatment for a range of mental health conditions, including anxiety and depression, and can be a valuable tool for helping first responders to manage the stress and trauma they experience in their work.\nHow CBT can help manage stress\nCBT can be an effective tool for helping first responders to manage stress by targeting the underlying thoughts and behaviors that contribute to their stress and anxiety. Here are some ways that CBT can help:\n- Identifying and challenging negative thought patterns: First responders are often exposed to traumatic and stressful situations that can lead to negative thoughts and beliefs, such as ""I\'m not good enough"" or ""I\'m in danger."" In CBT, the therapist works with the first responder to identify these negative thought patterns and challenge them with more realistic and positive ones.\nDeveloping coping strategies: CBT can help first responders to develop effective coping strategies for managing stress and anxiety. This might involve learning relaxation techniques, developing problem-solving skills, or engaging in activities that bring a sense of joy and accomplishment.\nBuilding resilience: CBT can help first responders to build resilience by teaching them skills for managing difficult emotions and situations. This can include developing a sense of purpose and meaning in their work, building supportive relationships with colleagues and loved ones, and practicing self-care.\nImproving communication skills: First responders often work in high-pressure and rapidly changing situations that require effective communication skills. CBT can help first responders to develop better communication skills, such as active listening and assertiveness, which can reduce stress and improve their ability to manage challenging situations.\nOverall, CBT can help first responders to develop the skills and strategies they need to better manage the stress and trauma they experience in their work. By targeting the underlying thoughts and behaviours that contribute to stress, CBT can help first responders to build resilience, develop effective coping strategies, and improve their overall well-being.\nTechniques for challenging negative thought patterns\nChallenging negative thought patterns is an important component of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and can be a useful tool for managing stress for first responders. Here are some techniques for challenging negative thought patterns:\n- Identify the negative thought: The first step in challenging negative thought patterns is to become aware of them. For first responders, negative thoughts may include beliefs such as ""I can\'t handle this"" or ""I\'m not good enough.""\nChallenge the evidence: Once the negative thought has been identified, the first responder can examine the evidence for and against the thought. They can ask themselves questions such as ""Is this thought based on fact or assumption?"" and ""What evidence do I have to support or refute this thought?""\nConsider alternative explanations: The first responder can then try to come up with alternative explanations for the situation that are more balanced and realistic. For example, instead of thinking ""I\'m not good enough,"" they could reframe the thought as ""I\'m doing the best I can in a difficult situation.""\nReframe the thought: Once the first responder has identified alternative explanations, they can reframe the negative thought in a more positive and balanced way. For example, instead of thinking ""This situation is too stressful for me to handle,"" they could reframe the thought as ""This situation is challenging, but I have the skills and resources to manage it.""\nPractice, practice, practice: Challenging negative thought patterns takes practice, and it can be helpful to work with a therapist or counsellor to develop these skills. The more the first responder practices challenging negative thoughts, the easier it will become over time.\nBy using these techniques to challenge negative thought patterns, first responders can develop more realistic and positive ways of thinking about themselves and their work, which can help to reduce stress and improve overall well-being.\nStrategies for changing behaviour and improving mood\nThere are several strategies that first responders can use to change their behaviour and improve their mood. Here are some examples:\n- Set achievable goals: Setting achievable goals can help first responders to feel more in control and improve their mood. For example, setting a goal to complete a specific task within a certain timeframe can provide a sense of accomplishment and boost mood.\nPractice self-care: First responders often put others\' needs before their own, but taking care of oneself is essential for managing stress and improving mood. Engaging in activities such as exercise, mindfulness, and hobbies can help to reduce stress and improve mood.\nDevelop a support network: Building a support network of colleagues, family, and friends can provide emotional support and reduce feelings of isolation. Regularly connecting with others can help to improve mood and reduce stress.\nUse positive affirmations: Repeating positive affirmations can help first responders to challenge negative thoughts and beliefs. Examples of positive affirmations might include ""I am capable and competent"" or ""I am making a difference in people\'s lives.""\nEngage in problem-solving: Engaging in problem-solving can help first responders to feel more in control and improve their mood. For example, if a specific situation is causing stress, they can brainstorm solutions and create an action plan to address the problem.\nPractice relaxation techniques: Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization can help to reduce stress and improve mood. These techniques can be practiced regularly, even during brief breaks throughout the day.\nBy using these strategies to change behaviour and improve mood, first responders can develop a greater sense of control over their work and improve their overall well-being. It\'s important to note that seeking support from a therapist or counsellor can also be helpful in developing these strategies and addressing underlying mental health concerns.', 'Cognitive Behavior Therapy is a form of talk therapy that emphasizes the present, is structured, and goal focused. It is rooted in theories and techniques that have been scientifically tested.\nWhat is Cognitive Behavioral Theory?\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of treatment based on cognitive and behavioral theories of causes of emotions and what leads to particular self-defeating behaviors. The CBT tools that a client might learn may be based on classical conditioning, operant conditioning, or social learning (modeling). These are very behavioral tools. More cognitively focused techniques stress the role thoughts and beliefs might play in producing emotional suffering and maladaptive behaviors. These cognitive theories are based on a model that stresses the role thinking (our beliefs) play in producing emotional suffering and maladaptive behaviors.\nCognitive Behavioral Treatments\nTraditional behavior therapies include Exposure plus Response Prevention (ERP, also called Flooding), Implosive Therapy, Systematic Desensitization, Shaping, Habit Reversal, Applied Behavioral Analysis, Role Playing, etc. Cognitive techniques evolved into forms of treatment including Rational Emotive Therapy (RET), which is now called Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy or REBT, Cognitive Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Self-Instructional Training, etc.\nComponents of cognitive-behavioral therapy have been studied more than other psychotherapies, and have proven to be effective for many issues. In as little as 8-12 weeks, many techniques have shown promising results. Cognitive restructuring techniques, problem solving, relaxation training, communication skills, and combinations of these techniques have reduced both the experience of anger and many of the associated behaviors.\nCognitive Behavioral Techniques\nCognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that reduces current symptoms by addressing the current causes of the issue. CBT theory proposes that emotional problems result not only because of a particular event, but also the individual’s interpretation and behaviors associated with the event. Certain interpretations, or beliefs, about the self, others, future, or even life in general can influence emotions and behaviors.\nAlbert Ellis’ ABC model is a helpful way to conceptualize how beliefs and interpretations are involved in emotional episodes. “A” represents Activating Events, “B” is for Beliefs, and “C” is for Consequences.\nActivating events (A’s), are anything real or imagined that activates our belief system (B’s) and results in an emotional consequence (C). Emotional Consequences (Ce’s), set the stage for behavioral consequences (Cb’s).\nIf you were bumped by someone with a backpack while walking on the sidewalk, that could be an A. You may then believe (B), “He should watch where he is going, and at a minimum apologize.” The combination of this activating event (A) and belief (B), may result in anger, and an emotional consequence (C).\nA x B = Ce\nActivating event Belief Consequence emotional\n(Inconsiderate behavior) (Others should always be considerate) (Anger)\nHere is an REBT self-help form to allow you to challenge irrational beliefs by disputing them (asking challenging questions) and then writing new effective philosophies: REBT-Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Self-Help Form\nIrrational Beliefs and Cognitive Distortions\nThere are numerous schools of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), each of which may have particular cognitions that are emphasized more than others. And over time, even one particular school makes changes. Below are a few examples.\nFour Core Irrational Beliefs developed by Albert Ellis, founder of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT)\nThings should or have to occur as I prefer, like, or in the way that I believe is right. Some times demands are referred to as musts. Here are three major musts:\ni) I must do well or get approval (or I’m inadequate)\nii) You must treat me nicely (or you’re inadequate)\niii) The world (life) must give me what I want quickly, easily, and with great certainty (or it’s Awful)\nSomething is magnified to be 100% completely bad. It is also called catastrophizing. Words like awful, horrible, terrible, and catastrophic may indicate awfulizing is occurring, especially if the event is seemingly insignificant compared to other bad events in one’s life.\nLow-frustration Tolerance (LFT)\nThis is a thought that underestimates one’s capacity to tolerate or experience an event, situation, or experience. I can’t stand it, or this is unbearable, or I can’t take it may indicate that there is some LFT taking place.\nGlobal Evaluations of Worth\nThese beliefs are global ratings of worth placed on the self, others, or even life, the world, or the future. Examples would be calling oneself a loser, winner, success, or failure. Rather than rating particular behaviors, individuals may globally evaluate the worth of a particular subject in a way that does not accurately capture its value to different stakeholders.\nOverview of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has evolved over decades. What has not changed is the emphasis on scientifically testing theories and clinical techniques. Behavior Therapy (BT) was developed first. Based on principles of learning from scientific laboratories, behavior therapists began applying techniques to patients.\nLearning principles established in the classical conditioning work of Pavlov and operant conditioning work of B.F. Skinner (psychologist) and others, could be applied to help people suffering with various disorders, such as anxiety. For example, Dr. Joseph Wolpe (psychiatrist) and his protege, Dr. Arnold Lazarus (psychologist) promoted the use of systematic desensitization.\nSystematic Desensitization as Behavior Therapy\nSystematic desensitization involves the therapist helping the patient to identify different levels of what triggers their anxiety response. Then a fear or anxiety hierarchy is developed. The next step is for the psychotherapy patient to be taught and practice an effective relaxation technique.\nOnce the therapy patient can effectively produce a relaxation response, the conditioning begins. The therapist or the psychotherapy patient may describe the trigger that will at first produce a lower level of anxiety. After the anxiety response has occurred in response to exposure to the anxiety stimulus, the therapy patient then produces a relaxation response.\nAccording to Wolpe, one cannot be simultaneously anxious and relaxed at the same time. He called this concept reciprocal inhibition. An incompatible response, e.g., relaxation is then to be selected to replace anxiety. With practice a therapy patient can learn to have a relaxation response follow the anxiety trigger. As the therapy progresses, the behavior therapist has the psychotherapy patient gradually work up the fear or anxiety hierarchy, until the patient can successfully cope with even the most intense anxiety trigger.\nBehavior Therapy (BT) has been effectively applied to numerous disorders, e.g., Autism, major depression, and the clinical applications include prolonged exposure therapy, exposure with response prevention (ERP), assertiveness training, contingency management techniques, behavioral activation, Problem Solving Therapy, Functional Analytic Psychotherapy, Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).\nRational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) and Cognitive Therapy\nRational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT)\nAlbert Ellis, a clinical psychologist, began conducting psychotherapy after being trained as a psychoanalyst. He eventually changed his approach and incorporated lessons from philosophy into a therapeutic technique, whereby he encouraged therapy patients to adopt more rational beliefs about themselves, a particular situation, others, the world and the future. He proposed that by changing changing irrational beliefs to more rational beliefs, therapy patients could change their emotions.\nFor example, a client with the proper therapeutic intervention or tools learned in therapy, could challenge the belief that she would be a failure if she failed her cell biology final and it would be awful if she received a C in the course. She would then replace those irrational beliefs with something more realistic or rational like, “It may be accurate that I failed that final, but I don’t become a failure for failing an exam. And it may be really bad if I receive a C in the course, sense that will keep me from reaching my goal of an A average, but it is not truly awful.”\nWith rational beliefs about a negative event, a negative emotional state will still occur. For example, irrational beliefs about a potential bad grade may produce anxiety, while rational beliefs would produce concern. Removing emotions or changing negative ones to positive ones as the consequence of a negative activating event is not the goal. It would not be adaptive to feel joyous after failing to meet a goal.\nAccording to Ellis’ Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), healthy negative emotions, e.g., concern, disappointment, sadness, etc. can motivate adaptive behaviors. Disappointment after a poor grade may encourage more preparation before the next exam. But unhealthy emotions such as panic, depression, or rage are likely to be followed with self-destructive behaviors.\nEllis called this model of events, beliefs, and consequences (emotional and behavioral) the ABC model.\n- A stands for activating events,\n- “B” for beliefs (rational and irrational),\n- and “C” for consequences (emotional and behavioral).\nThis ABC model has been adopted by many cognitive behavior therapists.\nAaron T. Beck, a psychiatrist, developed a similar therapy that emphasized the role of cognition on emotional states and behaviors. Beck’s original work focused on the clinical issue of depression. Beck helped his psychotherapy patients become keenly aware of different types of cognitions, e.g., automatic thoughts, cognitive distortions, core beliefs, and schemas.\nAgain one of the targets emphasized in his cognitive therapy (CT) is challenging the cognitive distortions in order to make them more realistic and helpful. In the case of depression, he proposed therapists should focus on cognitive distortions about the self, world, and future.\nThis is now called the Cognitive Triad. As is true with Ellis’ Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), Cognitive Therapy (CT) also included more behavioral technique such as activity scheduling. Many proponents of Beck and Ellis’ cognitive theories of emotion believe the mechanism of change is cognitive restructuring, i.e., changes in cognitions produce changes in emotions in these treatments.\nWhile there is little argument that these treatments can be effective at reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms, many behaviorists believe the mechanisms of change are not solely cognitive, but rather rely on the behavioral learning principles identified above in the section on behavior therapy.\nThe mechanism of change is one of the biggest reasons for disagreement between the more cognitive therapists and those who ascribe to behavioral therapy. Nonetheless, most people view cognitive and behavior therapists as operating under one large umbrella, Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT).\nReferences for Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT)\n- Beck, J.

27	help fixing broken electronics cost environment	You can get broken electronics fixed for FREE or a small donation at Repair Cafes, where knowledgeable volunteers help fix various items. This is environmentally beneficial as it helps reduce e-waste, which is crucial since electronic waste production is increasing by 3-4% annually worldwide. Additionally, repairing extends product lifespan and prevents the extraction of rare metals needed for new electronics, which is a polluting industry causing environmental and health issues in mining countries.	['Before you head to one of ElectroRecycle’s 230+ collection sites across B.C. to recycle a broken small appliance or power tool – visit a Repair Cafe first!\nWhat is a Repair Cafe?\nRepair Cafes are community gatherings where visitors bring in broken household items to be fixed for FREE, or for a small donation. At the event, knowledgeable volunteers give advice and help to fix things like small appliances, power tools, furniture, electronics, bicycles, jewelry, decorations, clothing, and toys. When you visit a Repair Cafe, you and an expert repairer will roll up your sleeves to troubleshoot the fix together. It’s an ongoing learning process.\nWhy is a Repair Café worth visiting?\nRepair cafes help to reduce the amount of waste in the environment. Rather than throwing away a broken item, you can bring it to the cafe and have it fixed instead. This helps to extend the life of the item and prevent it from ending up in a landfill.\nRepairing an item can be cheaper than buying a new one. Visiting a repair cafe can help you save money on repairs and reduce your overall expenses.\nLearn new skills\nRepair cafes often have volunteers who are skilled at fixing a variety of items. By bringing your broken item to the cafe, you can learn how to fix it yourself and gain new skills that you can use in the future.\nMeet new people\nRepair cafes are community spaces where people can come together and work on fixing items. It’s a great opportunity to meet new people and connect with others who are passionate about reducing waste and protecting the environment. For example – at the North Saanich Repair Cafe, each event comes together through the help of an average of 18 volunteers. North Saanich’s volunteers are event and volunteer coordinators, set-up and take-down crews, website experts, email responders, data sorters and managers, advertisers, administrators, community facilitators, parts shoppers, and of course – expert fixers!\nWhat is the likelihood the item will be fixed?\nLets take a look at some real life data from the North Saanich Repair Cafe, which happens once a month on Vancouver Island. In early 2023, ElectroRecycle partnered with the Repair Cafe to collect items that couldn’t be fixed and offer an extra recycling location for the community.\nThe Repair Cafe saw fixes to things like vacuums, sewing machines, a number of DVDs and lamps, lots of dull blades, a portable heater, and a couple of clocks as well as clothing and jewelry. The more unusual fixes were a compost bucket (to make compost tea) and a school’s paper cutter.\nSince 2020, more than 1000 different items have been presented for repair at the North Saanich Repair Cafe. And on-average 67 – 75% of the items are fixed by their amazing volunteers!\nThis number is consistent with numbers found by other Repair Cafes as well (like the Port Coquitlam Repair Cafe) which reports that approximately 70% of their items brought in for repair go home fixed!\nElectroRecycle’s role at Repair Cafés\nOur recycling program’s main objective is to keep small appliances and power tools out of landfill. When possible, we attend alongside Repair Cafes to promote repair and collect small appliances and power tools beyond repair for recycling. In addition, we aim to spread awareness about the variety of electrical items (400+ different types!) that our program accepts. Above all, we want British Columbians to know how to recycle these items, ensuring proper disposal at their end-of-life.\nB.C. Repair Cafes in 2023\nHere’s a round-up of Repair Cafe’s we’ve heard are happening this year in British Columbia. Additionally, a database of Repair Cafes being held globally can be found at RepairCafe.org.\nPlease note that ElectroRecycle is NOT the host of these Repair Cafes, and ElectroRecycle may be in attendance at some but not all of the below listed Repair Cafes to collect recycling.

(2) In addition to the increasing consumption of electronic products, the life span of these products is getting shorter.\nIn 2019, WEEE had a recycling rate of 42.5% in Europe, 11.7% in Asia and 0.9% in Africa. (3) Yet, some of those wastes contain precious recoverable metals. Furthermore, untreated WEEE are a threat to the environment and health due to the potential presence of heavy metals, pollution in landfills, and associated greenhouse gas emissions.\nmetric tonnes (Mt) of e-waste are estimated to have been generated worldwide in 2019 (4)\nWhy is e-waste a key issue for the aid sector?\nCountries of operation often lack an appropriate waste management system and, when they do exist, these systems can be overwhelmed or neutralised in a crisis situation. Some countries have proper legislation but not always enforced.\nIn developing countries, waste is mostly dumped in open landfills or incinerated, without much triage process. When they are not burnt or buried, WEEE are sometimes recycled in an artisanal way without any precautions for people or the environment.\nThe aid sector uses a lot of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) such as computers, mobile phones, air conditioners, printers, solar panels and batteries, refrigerators, televisions for the most common. The vast majority of this equipment ends its life in the field of operation and is not properly managed.\n#1 Monitor, plan, and inform\nThe proper management of WEEE will require prior monitoring and planning. Monitoring consists of measurement work that will enable to size and plan activities and flows. Planning should consider the human, material and financial resources needed for the sustainable management of WEEE and the existing local resources and capacities. While the positive effects of reducing e-waste will remain barely visible at the scale of the organisation, it is important to value the progress and share measurable objectives to spread motivation throughout the staff, technicians and users.\nAn organisation can:\n- Implement WEEE monitoring, including recording of the volume and type of waste generated.\n- Identify the resources needed to implement proper WEEE management.\n- Ensure traceability of WEEE (e.g., Waste Tracking Form).\n- Identify local or regional recycling and treatment facilities. Seek public and private partnerships.\n- Mutualise and join forces with other organisations and project-holders sharing the same issues. Capitalise and share information (on needs, local facilities, transport) and help each other’s.\n- Ensure a technological watch on equipment (less energy-consuming, less polluting, more repairable).\n- Train the relevant staff to choose, maintain and repair equipment, and manage the e-waste.\n- Communicate on the efforts and results.\n#2 Refuse and reduce\nRefuse unnecessary or superficial devices and packaging. Reduce purchases of new or high consumption equipment. The best-managed waste is the waste you do not produce: make sure you buy the right, needed equipment, in the right quantity, and prefer products which produce as little waste as possible.\nAn organisation can:\n- Avoid inappropriate or useless purchases. Assess electronic needs and ensure the devices purchased cover a real need (usefulness of 5g phones, touchscreen laptops or numerous screens).\n- Share equipment as much as possible with others (cold chain, printers, flex offices).\n- Do not replace equipment as long as it is functional or repairable (even for a less polluting one).\n- Procure in priority secondhand reconditioned equipment.\n- For new purchases, select long-life equipment, the greenest (ecolabels, certifications, low-tech, produced with recycled materials), easily repairable or modular.\n- Standardise equipment as much as possible in order to develop specific expertise for technical support, and stocks of consumables or spare parts.\n- Refuse unnecessary packaging, reduce harmful and wasteful products, request reusable or returnable containers.\n#3 Maintain, repair, and reuse\nAppropriate use, regular maintenance and repair extend the lifespan of devices and reduces the production of WEEE. The re-use of equipment, internally or externally (donations), makes it possible to extend the life of equipment.\nAn organisation can:\n- Standardise procedures for use, maintenance, and life cycle management. Carry out preventive and corrective maintenance.\n- Raise staff awareness on stakes and best practice in the use of electronic equipment. Create factsheets or manuals if necessary.\n- Develop skills to assess whether a device should be discarded or repaired. Develop skills and repair workshops, or use external ones.\n- Recondition (cleaning, upgrading) and reuse for same purpose. Identify reconditioning companies in the region of intervention.\n- Share information with others, assess and mutualise transport to reconditioning companies.\nAging electronic devices can be used for lesser purpose before considering being disposed.\nAn organisation can:\n- Reuse computers whose power is no longer adequate for less demanding uses (meeting room computers, server).\n- Make donations to local charities (schools or youth centers). Beware of donations to developing countries, which have little or no infrastructure for recycling and processing WEEE.\n- Ensure the disposal of EEE donated to other users is agreed on and understood by informing beneficiaries about e-wastes stakes and risks.\n#5 Sort and recycle\nProper and systematic sorting of WEEE is essential for subsequent treatment or recycling operations. Sorting should be carried out as early as possible in the waste production chain. Recycling avoids the need to mine, extract or produce again new raw materials.\nAn organisation can:\n- Develop sorting rules according to existing disposal options. Train staff in these rules.\n- Pre-sort the equipment by separating, if possible, the most sensitive components. Ensure safe handling of dangerous equipment.\n- Implement sorting as close as possible to the place where the waste is produced.\n- Check for and evaluate local recyclers (e.g., Weeecentre in Kenya). Some specialised companies recover rare metal from WEEE and sell them again as raw materials.\n- Share information with others, develop and mutualise channels for transporting equipment to recycling companies.\n- Support the development or maintenance of local recovery and recycling capacities (advocacy, join forces other organisations).\nElements that cannot be reduced, reused, or recycled will be disposed. WEEE must be treated in specific ways, considering the hazardousness or preciousness of each component and in partnership with local channels. Hazardous waste should be treated appropriately, locally if possible, or returned to suitable sites if necessary. The organisation’s responsibility is not limited to waste disposal: it is not enough to have a contract with an official waste disposal company, it is also necessary to know where the waste is going and how it will be disposed of.\nAn organisation can:\n- Use locally available treatment and disposal channels. Establish partnerships. Support the development of local disposal capacities where needed.\n- Capitalise and share information with others. Mutualise partnerships and contracts with other organisations sharing the same issues to make economies of scale (cost and GHG emissions).\n- Ensure hazardous waste are decommissioned and dismantled in a responsible manner. Send hazardous waste that cannot be properly disposed locally to suitable sites (and share transport and contracts with others).\n- Involve travelling staff to bring back a few kg of WEEE to countries with suitable channels (“Take a waste”). Caution: decision to be weighed according to the climate impact of the associated transport.\n- Store waste that cannot be disposed of properly. Never allow your waste to be disposed of in illegal dumps.\nKey points of attention\nIt is necessary to adopt a “life cycle” approach and to take into account the following essential stages:\n- Needs assessment (to reduce quantity in use)\n- Responsible procurement policy\n- Operation (use and maintenance)\n- Recycling, dismantling and disposal\nApply the Rs methods during the product life cycle:\n- Refuse – no need to use it\n- Reduce – use less of it\n- Repair – make it usable again\n- Reuse– use it again for the same purpose\n- Repurpose – use it again for another purpose\n- Recycle – transform and use its components again in other production cycle\nIs it easy to implement?\nAs for other types of waste, the main difficulty, upstream, is to develop internal skills and capacities for procurement, responsible use and maintenance. This will extend the lifespan of an EEE item, and determine whether it should be disposed or repaired.\nDownstream, i.e., when EEE become waste (WEEE), the main difficulty is the lack or deficiency of local waste management systems (recycling or disposal). Few interesting and the final sites of waste disposal are sometimes uneasy to access. In addition, having a contract with an official waste disposal company is not enough; it is important to know what they do with it.\n- Reduction of pollution\n- Internal capacity and resilience building\n- Creation of local jobs in repair, recycling, treatment\n- Contribution to the local economy\n- Acceleration and local strengthening of waste management legislation and capacities.\nConditions for success\n- Mobilise and raise awareness among the staff on environmental issues, and educate them about the threats posed by WEEE to target populations, not only on the mid and long term (health, pollution and climate change), but also in the short term, with the frequent presence of acutely toxic substances\n- Develop internal capacities (or involve external ones) in purchasing, maintenance, logistics (supply, transport, storage, etc.), environmental analysis and assessment of waste management channels\n- Establish partnerships with other organisations in order to share equipment (cold chain, solar panels) and certain activities (maintenance, transport, sorting, collection, disposal)\n- Define the acceptable cost of recycling and treatment of waste, especially the most hazardous waste\nPrerequisites & specificities\n- The waste management context will be very different from one region, country or even city to another\n- Access to local recycling and disposal facilities\n- Network of contacts with other organisation sharing the same issues locally\n- Increased internal costs\n- Increased complexity of internal processes\nFood for thought\nFood for thought\nSending secondhand devices for reuse in developing countries – as in Africa – is not necessarily a good idea from an environmental point of view, (unless the local capacity to manage their end of life is taken into account). Indeed, unlike in wealthier countries, there are few infrastructures for recycling and treatment of WEEE in developing countries, particularly in the least developed ones. Waste usually ends up in legal or illegal landfills, contributing to local environmental pollution and sometimes to additional health crises.\nGood to know\nBeyond the immediate danger that e-waste represents, the extraction of rare metals needed to produce our smartphones, computers, solar panels, lithium batteries and other connected objects is in itself a polluting industry. Major producing countries such as China and the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, are experiencing disastrous pollution and health issues in and around the mines. (8)\nIn addition to environmental and human stakes, the future shortage of precious metals contained in WEEE should encourage maximum recycling. Indeed, the price of nickel or lithium for electric batteries is rising sharply and some metals could soon face shortage (gallium, indium, yttrium, tantalum, etc.). Yet, these metals are present in many electronic waste products without being recycled or recovered. (9)\nAn estimated US$57 billion worth of recoverable materials were discarded or burned at the responsibility of producers in regions of the world without legislation. (10)\nLa Poste group - repair, reuse, and recovery of electrical and electronic equipment\nLa Poste group is deploying a more virtuous management of its mobile phones, smartphones and tablets: repair, then reuse and recycling. In 2020, 7,300 smartphones and tablets were repaired and put back into service for employees. 3,100 computers and monitors, as well as 18,000 mobile phones that were still functional but no longer met La Poste’s needs, were given a second life by other organisations. The group produced 950 tons of WEEE, 94% of which was recycled. (11)\nWEEE Centre in Kenya\nThe Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Centre, based in Kenya, provides awareness raising, training and disposal services for electrical and electronic waste in accordance with waste, environmental and public health regulations. The WEEE Centre manages environmentally sound operations and is committed to the efficient, safe and reasonable disposal of electrical and electronic waste.

28	How did an Italian explorer influence maps of Asia?	Marco Polo, an Italian merchant traveler, was the first European to visit China and other far eastern territories from 1275 to 1295. He spent 17 years in Kublai Khan's palace. His journey influenced European cartography, leading to the creation of numerous maps.	['Discovery of Greenland (Erik the Red)\nBorn Erik Thorvaldsson, he was credited for establishing the first Norse settlement in Greenland after he was exiled on charges of manslaughter in Norway around the year 982. Called ‘Erik the Red’ for his flaming red hair, he ventured into an expedition with 25 ships, where 14 made the journey while the rest turned back or were lost at sea. The settlement grew with 5000 inhabitants, especially along Eriksfjord and neighboring fjords as immigrants came in from over-populated Iceland.\nDiscovery of Newfoundland, Canada (Leif Erikson)\nThe son of Erik the Red, a Viking explorer, he also became a famous explorer just like his father when he embarked on his own expeditions towards North America. Considered the “first European to venture into North America,” he arrived at the place which he called Vinland in the 11th century. Archaeological remains substantiated this claim as they found some remains of Vikings in what is known as Newfoundland, Canada.\nFirst Solo Circumnavigation of the World (Joshua Slocum)\nThe first man who single-handedly traveled around the world, Joshua Slocum was a Nova Scotian-born naturalized American seaman and adventurer who wrote the book “Sailing Alone Around the World,” chronicling his journey. He started on April 24, 1895 on his self-built gaff-rigged oyster boat named ‘Spray’ from Fairhaven, Massachusetts and returned to Newport, Rhode Island three years later on June 27, 1898, circumnavigating the world at a distance of more than 48,000 miles.\nThe First Men to Conquer Mt. Everest (Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay)\nEdmund Hilary and Tenzing Norgay,a Nepali Sherpa from Darjeeling, India, were part of the ninth British expedition to conquer Mt. Everest led by John Hunt. They reached the summit on May 29, 1953, 11:30 AM local time via the South Col Route. Though they both acknowledged it as a team effort, Tenzing later revealed that it was Hillary who had put his foot first on the summit where they took photographs and buried a few sweets and a small cross before descending. Hunt and Hillary were knighted by Queen Elizabeth in the Order of the British Empire while Tenzing was given the George Medal by UK. They were both nationally recognized inNepal and are honored annually with ceremonies in schools and offices to celebrate their feat.\nFirst Expedition to South Pole (Roald Amundsen)\nRoald Engelbregt Gravning Amundsen was a famous Norwegian explorer who was recognized as the first man to reach the South Pole in December 1911 and the first expedition leader to reach the North Pole in 1928. One of the key leaders in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Expeditions, he initially decided to go for Antarctica due to some funding problems and news that other explorers had already conquered the North Pole. Using the ship “Fram,” he and his men left Oslo, Norway on June 3, 1910 for the south. 16 years later, however, Amundsen and 15 of his crew made the first crossing of the Arctic using an airship and landing in Alaska two days later. Since the three previous claims to have arrived at the North Pole were all disputed, Amundsen would be the first man to cross the North Pole by air.\nLists Going Viral Right Now\nThe Search for the Nile’s Source in Africa (David Livingstone)\nDavid Livingstone, a Scottish medical missionary, had become famous for his exploits and has gained mythical status mainly due to his geographical exploration of Africa, his disappearance, and death. One of the first Westerners to make a transcontinental journey across Africa from 1854 to 1856, he returned to Zanzibar in January 1866 to seek out the source of the Nile. Though he was wrong about the Nile, he discovered numerous geographical features including the Victoria Falls, Lake Ngawi, lake Bangwelu, and Lake Malawi.\nDiscovery of China (Marco Polo)\nAn Italian merchant traveler, he was widely recognized as the first European to visit China and other far eastern territories from 1275 to 1295. From a family of mercantile traders, he apparently met Kublai Khan between the years 1271 and 1275 and spent 17 years in his palace. His pioneering journey inspired other explorers like Christopher Columbus to embark on the same and he had also influenced European cartography leading to the creation of numerous maps.\nThe 8,000 Mile Exploration of the West (Meriwether Lewis and William Clark Sacagawea)\nThe “Corps of Discovery Expedition” from May 1804 to September 1806 was considered the 2nd transcontinental expedition undertaken by the Europeans in the Pacific Coast after Alexander Mackenzie’s crossing in 1803. Lewis and Clark relied on their navigation skills during the westward exploration where they learned to cook edible plants and make leather clothes out of moccasins. Commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson, they embarked on the expedition with a select group of US Army volunteers to primarily explore and map the newly-acquired territories, find alternate routes across the Western half of the continent, and secure it from Britain and other powers who might tried to seize it.\n1831 HMS Beagle Explorations (Charles Darwin)\nThe famed naturalist was also an explorer as he spent a significant amount of time charting the coastlines of South America. During the voyages he would investigate geology and natural history and send specimens and copies of his journal to his family every now and then. These entries became the basis for his “evolutionary theory”.\nThe First Circumnavigation of the Earth (Ferdinand Magellan)\nA Portuguese-born explorer, who served King Charles I of Spain after Portugal refused to fund his expeditions, he led the first voyage around the world from August 10, 1519 to 1522 in a westward route in search of the famed “Spice Islands.” He sailed from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, which he called as “peaceful sea,” with 5 ships and a crew of 270 men from several nations. Though he himself did not complete the entire voyage as he was killed by Lapu-Lapu in the Battle of Mactan in Cebu, Philippines on April 17, 1521, he was still credited for the expedition. Out of the 5 ships and 270 crew members, only one surviving ship, ‘Victoria,’ returned to Spain with 18 people on board.\nThe First Landing on the Moon (Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin Aldrin)\nBroadcast on live TV to be watched by the world, Apollo 11 with its 3 crew members was the first space flight that landed humans on the moon on July 20, 1969. Armstrong’s first step to the lunar space became a celebrated event with his now famous phrase, “that’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.”\nDiscovery of the Northeast Coast of America (John Cabot)\nAn Italian-born explorer, John Cabot was commissioned by Henry VI of England from 1480 to 1497 to find alternative western route to Asia. While on the course of his expeditions, he was able to discover some parts of the northeast coast of America. Because of his feat, he was later given funds by the British to go on another expedition, this time to explore the Atlantic.\nFirst Man to Travel into Space (Yuri Gagarin)\nDuring the first part of the Space Race, Russia could have was probably slightly ahead of the United States. Eight years before Apollo 11 landed on the moon in 1969, Yuri Gagarin, a Russian cosmonaut, had already been able to circumnavigate the earth making him the “first man to travel into space.” His flight, however, lasted less than 2 hours.\nDiscovery of the Caribbean (Christopher Columbus)\nOwing to the popularity of the exploits of Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus, a Genoese colonizer and navigator also embarked on expeditions for 13 years funded by the Spanish monarchy in exchange for new territories, spices, and conversion of people to Christianity. This led him to discover North, South and Central America including the islands in the West Indies with his ships the Pinta, Santa Maria and Niata using the direct route to the east and west. Due to miscalculations, however, their ships landed in the Bahamas and Cuba in 1492. His discoveries established the links between the Native Americans and the Europeans, which paved the way for its colonization. Columbus will always be honored for discovering the “New World” and for debunking the myth that the world is flat.\nFirst Woman to Fly a Plane (Louise Arner Boyd)\nWhile the Wright Brothers were immortalized for building the first airplane, Louise Arner Boyd became the ‘first woman to ever fly a plane over the North Pole’ in 1955. Known for her moniker, the “Ice Woman,” Boyd was lauded for her research and adventures in Greenland, where her studies of the fjords and glaciers led to the discovery of a chain of sea mounts in the Arctic Ocean.\nDiscovery of India (Vasco da Gama)\nThe expeditions of this Portuguese explorer from 1460 to 1524 led to the discovery of a trade route to India as he and his crew traversed the Cape of Good Hope and ended up on the East Coast of Africa. This route laid the foundations for future exploration, making Vasco da Gama one of the greatest heroes of the European age of discovery.\nDiscovery of the North Pacific (Abel Tasman)\nFrom 1603 to 1659, Abel Tasman embarked on explorations of the North Pacific with the primary aim of mapping beaches and coastlines in the region. Along the way he was able to explore New Zealand, Australia and the Van Diemans Land or present-day Tasmania.\nDiscovery of the Hudson Bay (Henry Hudson)\nDuring one of his numerous expeditions from 1550 to 1611, Hudson, an English navigator, discovered Hudson Bay as he and his crews were looking for the Northwest Passage. The Northwest Passage would become the main route to the east by traversing the Arctic Circle.\nExplorations of Australia, New Zealand and North America (James Cook)\nThere were no other explorers before him who had sailed further south which led James Cook to discover and map out Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii and North America during the mid 1700s. It also led to the creation of the North-West trade route which served as a guide to other future explorers. He was killed on his third expedition in 1779 to the islands of Hawaii.\nDiscovery of East Africa (Sir Richard Burton)\nIf not for Sir Richard Burton, the world may not have known the classics “Aladdin and the Magic Lamp” or “Alibaba and his Forty Thieves.” The son of a British army officer, he served as the captain in the Indian army for seven years before embarking on expeditions to the Americas, Asia and Africa from 1821 to 1890, which led him to Saudi Arabia and the Lake Tanganyika in Africa. He was also credited for translating the famous Arabian folktales “One Thousand and One Nights” and for publishing the “Kama Sutra” in English.\nDiscovery of America (Amerigo Vespucci)\nThough Christopher Columbus was credited for discovering the New World, the honor of its name is given to Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian navigator whose expeditions were funded by the Portuguese crown. He first landed on what is known today as Brazil and met the natives of South America in 1502. Believing at first that the unknown territory was India, he called the natives “Indians,” a name that stuck to this day.\nDiscovery of Panama (Vasco Núñez de Balboa)\nA Spanish conquistador, governor and explorer, he became famous for being the first European in 1513 to cross the Isthmus of Panama to the Pacific Ocean, which was known at that time as the South Sea. During his travels to the New World in 1500, he came across the island of Hispaniola and built the settlement of Santa Maria la Antigua del Darién, or present-day Panama in 1510, which became the first permanent European settlement on the mainland of America.\nFirst Man to Dive into the Sea (William Beebe)\nDue to his fascination with the natural world, Beebe, an American naturalist and explorer conducted numerous expeditions for the New York Zoological Society.

29	I'm new to yoga - what's the difference between shoulder joint and girdle?	The shoulder joint is where the arm attaches to the shoulder blade (like a ball and socket) and moves the arm in every direction. The shoulder girdle is what moves the shoulder blades up-down-forward-back.	"[""Pose of the Month: Crocodile Poseby Jenn Tarrant | 29/05/2017\nIIf this pose seems challenging, that’s because it IS! Here’s how we can cue Crocodile so our students enjoy its benefits without risk to the shoulder girdle.\nCrocodile Pose is one of the most challenging poses to execute well with strength and safety. So often, we see students “dump” into the pose, or “hunch and wing” as they try to hold it. Then we see the die-hard “hover-1-inch-away-from-the-floor” crowd. What’s a teacher to do? How on earth do we prepare our students adequately for the strength required and then cue them well so they enjoy all the benefits without inviting risk to the shoulder girdle? Let’s explore!\nMain Elements of Crocodile Pose\nShoulder Girdle Stability\nMost Challenging Aspects\nStaying engaged and lifted from crown of the head to heels\nKeeping head in line with the spine\nAvoiding “sagging” toward the floor\nUsing shoulder strength rather than “hanging out” in the shoulder joint\nAvoiding the heads of the shoulders dropping below 90 degrees\nBegin with the YogaFit standard Warm-Up (standing or supine) and a few rounds of Kneeling Sun Salutations (with Kneeling Crocodile and Cobra) to warm the body. Stay with the Kneeling variation so we don’t allow students to reinforce poor movement patterns in Crocodile or Upward-Facing Dog. Be sure to include Chest Expansion in the warm-up to release any tension in the shoulders. Remind students to keep shoulders back and down here!\nAn Anatomy Review\nHonestly, in my experience, not that many students are aware of how the shoulder works. So, take some time to explain the difference between the shoulder joint and the shoulder girdle. The short of it is this: the shoulder joint is where the arm attaches to the shoulder blade (like a ball and socket) and it’s what moves the arm in every direction. The shoulder girdle is what moves the shoulder blades up-down-forward-back.\nThe actions of the shoulder joint are flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, horizontal flexion, horizontal extension, and circumflexion. Reaching the arms forward, back and all around will help students to feel the shoulder joint move.\nThe actions of the shoulder girdle are elevation, depression, protraction, retraction, upward rotation and downward rotation. Hunching and releasing shoulders, hugging forward and opening shoulders back allows students to feel the actions of the shoulder girdle.\nPoses to Focus on Shoulder Girdle\nBring students onto All Fours. Demonstrate for students how to do “Shoulder Push Ups,” during which they allow themselves to sink into the shoulders (retraction) and then spread shoulders wide across the back (protraction). After doing several rounds, ask them to find that place between the two movements where the shoulder girdle feels supported from the front and back at the same time. Discuss how this is the same strong support needed for Crocodile Pose. Have students press back into Child’s Pose to rest.\nNext, let’s cue students through the under-appreciated Kneeling Plank to Crocodile series. Have them draw forward into Kneeling Plank and draw their awareness to the shoulder girdle, encouraging them to find the place of support they experienced in the All Fours Push Up. Then, have students shift slightly forward on their knees so their shoulders are over fingertips (rather than wrists). Begin with bending at the elbows, engaging the core, and lowering only one inch while focusing on the support of the shoulder girdle. Let’s call this “Baby Crocodile.” Do 3 to 5 repetitions. Don’t allow the front of the shoulders to dip down; keep them pointing forward.\nAs we move into Plank and Crocodile, pay attention to the students’ alignment. Notice where cueing awareness can create a stronger and better supported experience for them. Oftentimes, just by drawing their attention to the sensations in the body, you may notice that students will correct misalignments easily.\nCommon misalignments are:\n• hips sagging toward the floor, not activating the core\n• shoulders dropping lower than the elbows, many students “hover” with the heads of the shoulders just above the floor\n• shoulders hunching up by the ears or rolled in and down toward the floor\n• pushing the head towards the floor, so it is out of alignment with the spine\n• lack of dynamic tension in the legs\n• locking elbows\nMoving into the Pose\nIt is well worth students practicing Baby Crocodile exclusively until they can do the pose without loss of shoulder girdle support. Once they master Baby Crocodile by lowering one inch, encourage them to lower another inch. Continue this progression until students are able to lower to a 90-degree bend in the elbow with support for the shoulder girdle. Caution them not to go beyond a 90-degree angle.\nOnce students feel secure in Baby Crocodile, introduce this next phase: Baby Crocodile coming from Full Plank (knees lifted). Again, invite them to lower one inch and then release their knees to the floor to transition to Cobra, or flip the feet for Upward Facing Dog. When they feel ready, encourage them to keep lowering one inch at a time—with good alignment—until they are able to lower all the way to 90 degrees.\nNow for some props! Props can help students experience the alignment (or misalignment) of their shoulders, as well as their torsos. Here are a few ways to prop Crocodile.\n- Have students grab two yoga blocks and place them at the top of their mats. For most students, positioning them on the tallest side works best. The blocks should be slightly in front of the fingertips so that when students lower into Crocodile, they can rest their shoulders on the blocks. The blocks should be high enough so that the shoulders don’t dip below the line of the elbows. This is a great way for students to gain awareness of how high Crocodile Pose actually is!\n- Blocks can help prevent the hips from sagging towards the floor (like a hammock). Placing blocks under the hip points will add stability and awareness. The middle block height is likely the best here, but for some, the shortest side of the block may be better. Beginning in Full Plank and keeping a straight line from the crown of the head all the way to the heels, engage the core, and shift the weight forward so shoulders move beyond the wrists. Begin to lower down so the hip points can rest gently on the blocks. Of course the head of the shoulders should not dip below the elbows in this variation either.\n- A bolster under the whole torso, instead of blocks at the hip points, can make Crocodile even more accessible for newer students. Lower down so that the torso can rest on the bolster and the front of the shoulders face forward instead of down. Keep the gaze slightly forward instead of looking down.\nRemind your students that learning Crocodile Pose can takes weeks, months, even years! However, a Baby Crocodile done well is more stabilizing, offers more benefits, and is safer than a poorly supported Crocodile that falls apart as students lower. Encourage students to enjoy the feeling of building strength and knowing they are doing a great job!\nI’d love to hear from you!

The rate at which western education is dominating the world portends that indigenous knowledge would fade if better ways to disseminate and preserve it is not devised. Its preservation and dissemination is largely dependent on whether young generation has the heritage of preserving indigenous knowledge at heart. Hence, the study examined demographic characteristics and indigenous knowledge sharing practices among trado-medical practitioners in Ijebu North Local Government Areas of Ogun State.\nThe survey research design was used for the study. The study population was made up of three hundred and fifty-nine Trado-medical practitioners in Ijebu North Local Government Area in Ogun State. Total enumeration was employed to include the entire population of the study group. The instrument for data collection was self-structured questionnaire. The Cronbach’s Alpha used to test reliability coefficient for indigenous knowledge practice was 0.90, the demographic characteristics of trado-medical practitioners was 0.74 and indigenous knowledge was 0.86 and overall coefficient was 0.90. Data were analyzed using descriptive, linear regression and multiple regression analyses.\nFinding showed that marital status (85.2% ), sex (59.0%) and age (55.8%) with 43yrs above were the major demographic characteristics that enhance knowledge sharing practices among trado-medical practitioners. Nature observation (87.1%), training and apprentice (85.5%), brainstorming (84.8%), community of practice (82.6%) and discussion (71.9%) were mostly used by trado-medical practitioners for adequate knowledge sharing practices. Also, indigenous knowledge practice can be promoted through many social and formal Media (73.2%). Some of the major challenges encountered by trado-medical practitioners while sharing indigenous knowledge include the fact that the young generation of today do not consider the heritage of preserving indigenous knowledge as a priority (73.2%), the idea of traditionalizing all the status and images 75.2%, differentiating indigenous knowledge from others and (57.7%) showed lack of interest among young generation to preserve the knowledge due to the wide acceptance of western education.\nThe study concluded that demographic factors enhances indigenous knowledge sharing among trado-medical practitioners and found that marital status, sex and age were factors that enhanced trado-medical practitioners ability to share knowledge with ease, while the most prevailing challenge against the spread of indigenous knowledge is the attitude of young generation towards preserving and disseminating the knowledge. Based on the observed challenge, the researcher recommends that preservation of indigenous knowledge should be intensified by trado-medical practitioners among the young generation, government should increase the supervision and quality control of herbal drugs distribution around the Nigeria and establish support team to enable trado-medical practitioner’s function and help the society.\nKeywords: Demographic Characteristics, Indigenous Knowledge,\nKnowledge Sharing Practice, Trado-medical Practitioner, and Ijebu North Local\nShare a Comment\nYou can find more project topics easily, just search\nSIMILAR LIBRARY INFORMATION SCIENCE FINAL YEAR PROJECT RESEARCH TOPICS\n» ABSTRACT The main purpose of this study is to determine the training methods of librarians in ICT use in federal universities in the south east zone o...Continue Reading »\n89 pages | 23 hits | Source: LIBRARY INFORMATION SCIENCE\n2.

This year it follows the theme of “Rapid Response Restitution”, a concept developed by Azu Nwagbogu and Dr. Clémentine Deliss, with Guest Curator and Nigerian cultural historian Dr. Oluwatoyin Sogbesan.\nOn 7 November, 17:00 WAT/CET there will be the online launch of the digital “Home Museum”.\nWith “Rapid Response Restitution” LagosPhoto20 takes an unusual and participatory approach to current discussions on the return of Africa’s cultural heritage back to the continent. Central to this year’s edition is the “Home Museum”, an inclusive digital exhibition co-created by citizens in Nigeria and internationally who are invited to produce a fast shutter retrieval of their personal and family’s cultural heritage. Through high-speed photography, fleeting moments from the past are captured, helping to restore lost memories and demonstrate that the African continent is not trapped within an endless process of waiting for its heirlooms to be returned. On the contrary, the awareness created by Home Museum and the educational platforms set up by LagosPhoto20 will help to stimulate leverage and awareness of the issues around the restitution of cultural heritage in Africa.\nWhat is Restitution?\nDemands for the returns of iconic cultural artefacts back to African states have been made repeatedly, in particular in the 1970s, not only through UNESCO but in Nigeria through the cultural initiatives of FESTAC, the second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture. Today, we are witnessing an acceleration and democratisation of these debates. Senegalese economist Felwine Sarr and historian Bénédicte Savoy speak of the urgent need to enable Africa’s youth to access the knowledge embodied in these cultural artefacts which are still held in European museums. They insist that there should be no “monopoly of control”, but a “radical practice of sharing”. This ecology of restitution can benefit greatly from photographic digitization and Sarr/Savoy speak of the value of a shared portal with free access as well as the unconditional rights to image reproductions. Rather than claim individual state ownership, they emphasise a dialogue between cultures, stressingthat today artefacts no longer originate from one place but – like the younger generations – are inherently diasporic. Awareness of the restitution of cultural heritage can help to initiate a new “relational ethics” between past experience and future lives. Here, digital technology and new media play a central role in evoking cultural memories and remediating the pain of history embodied in the collections of African art still held in European museums\nLagosPhoto20: Rapid Response Restitution\nLagosPhoto believes it is important to begin constructively sensitizing the Nigerian public to the debates on restitution and to do this online through visual thinking and the medium of photography. Here photographic sequences of diverse and sometimes unrelated objects from different collections past and future are brought into a visual conversation with one another. This process helps to remediate the absence of the original object. Remediation reflects the current COVID-19 conditions within which we live and that require both healing, restoration and transformation.\nCultural heritage begins in the home. Each household harbours its ancestors and cosmogonies. LagosPhoto20 kicks off with an Open Call to citizens of all ages and backgrounds inviting them to engage in the discussion on restitution, and contribute images of artefacts and belongings that represent their personal idea of heritage. These may include traditional objects, personal collections, and cherished possessions, which evoke significant individual and communal histories. Home Museum will be predominantly online in order to ensure a wide and safe circulation of content. Central to its method is inclusive participation. It sees this edition as a potential model for a broader diasporic and pan-African engagement with questions of restitution and repatriation. Collections of historical African art held in museums are hard to access and often difficult to decipher for the outsider. Meanwhile, each artist and each citizen have their own imaginary visual collection built from personal belongings and experiences, including subjective responses to the differing flows of history. All are invited to participate and LagoPhoto20 has drafted the Open Call in Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo, Pidgin, Swahili, English, French and Russian.\nIn addition, LagosPhoto20 will stage extensive exhibitions both on site and online in collaboration with its long-standing institutional partners for example, the Alliance Française (Mike Adenuga Centre). This exhibition, which will feature both historical and contemporary works, seeks to address object photography both past present. Photographs of artefacts can include creative still-lifes, scientific and documentary forms of museum imaging with its changing styles of photography, artists’ interpretations of historical artefacts, and new juxtapositions of past objects within the context of Afrofuturism, post-ethnography, and decolonial practices.\nLagosPhoto20 Public Programs\nLagosPhoto20 aims to situate itself as a host for discussions that relate to the debates on restitution. Too often these talks are held in situations that are unfamiliar to communities and individuals for whom the topics are particularly relevant. The concept of restitution may have very different connotations depending on where one is located. LagosPhoto2020 will develop a series of online public discussions on different understandings of restitution, unpacking the connotations of the terms, and its reference to reparation as well as to the different types of artefacts it can denote, ranging from material objects to human remains. Digitization, open-source visual libraries, and various methodologies for the active restitution of memories and knowledge from the past will be explored by leading practitioners. Discussions on Rapid Response Restitution will be disseminated through local and international radio and digital television. Media partners are to include Beat FM, Nigeria Info, Wazobia, Arise TV and other stations.\nLagosPhoto20 Educational Programme\nThe educational programme will include activating temporary regional Home Museums in collaboration with local venues, programmes with schools in Lagos and the regions, workshops with photographers (both professional and amateur), drama performances illustrating restitution, and educational collaborations with Nigeria’s museums.']	['<urn:uuid:af626122-96aa-4b38-b88f-8ec16ff07488>', '<urn:uuid:9dac3186-fa09-4c43-8721-b880cf296c8d>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	11	36	2009
31	bulb types home garden benefits risks	Different types of bulbs offer various benefits and risks for home and garden use. Incandescent bulbs are inexpensive and emit an effective spectrum for plant growth, but they're very energy inefficient. Compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) are more energy-efficient, but they contain mercury, which is highly toxic and requires special disposal. High-intensity discharge (HID) lamps and LED bulbs are newer technologies that provide good lighting efficiency. However, if any mercury-containing bulbs (like CFLs or HIDs) break, they pose serious health risks including potential damage to the brain, kidneys, and lungs, requiring careful cleanup procedures and proper disposal at hazardous waste facilities.	['Managing Photoperiodic Lighting\nRoberto G. Lopez & Christopher Currey\nIn greenhouse and nursery production, photoperiod can influence many aspects of plant growth and development, including dormancy, storage organ formation and—most importantly for many greenhouse producers—flowering. Many potted flowering and bedding plants, cut flowers and herbaceous perennials flower in response to\nFigure 1. An incandescent light bulb with an aluminum pie plate reflector is one of the most common—and easiest—strategies to provide photoperiodic lighting for your crops.\nWhile we refer to photoperiod when discussing plant development, it’s actually the uninterrupted period of darkness that controls plant responses to day length. For most floriculture crops, a short day occurs when the night is at least 12 hours. For many long-day crops, a long day occurs when the night length is less than 10 hours, although this varies among species. Many annuals and perennials grown for spring sales are long-day crops and, as such, we need to use photoperiodic lighting to get these crops into flower (Figure 1). Alternatively, several important potted plants, such as chrysanthemums, kalanchoes and poinsettias, are short-day plants and photoperiodic lighting is used to keep these plants vegetative.\nThe natural photoperiod\nIn the northern hemisphere, day length increases between December 21 (the shortest day) until June 21 (the longest day), after which it decreases. Seasonal fluctuation in day length becomes more dramatic as the latitude increases. For example, the day length in New Orleans (30 degrees N latitude) ranges from around 11 hours to just over 14½ hours. Meanwhile, the day length in Minneapolis (45 degrees N latitude) ranges from 9½ to 16 hours. Because plants can perceive low light intensities, the natural (or biological) day length is approximately 30 to 40 minutes longer than the period from sunrise to sunset due to civil twilight.\nTo determine your natural photoperiod, first determine your day length using the local times for sunrise and sunset. Next, add approximately 30 to 40 minutes to account for civil twilight. This will help determine when you will need to use photoperiodic lighting and how to manage it.\nUsing photoperiodic light to create long days\nIf your goal is to create a long day (LD) photoperiod, you may use day-extension or night-interruption photoperiodic lighting. Each method has advantages and disadvan-tages, but generally, they’re similarly effective. Both methods require you to deliver at least 10 foot candles (f.c.) or ~2 µmol·m−2·s−1 of light when measured at plant level.\nFigure 2. A high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamp with an oscillating reflector is a newer technology used to provide photoperiodic, not supplemental, lighting to plants in the greenhouse.\nDay-extension (DE) lighting is the practice of delivering light to extend the length of the natural day. The length of time you light will depend on the period of darkness the plant requires and the natural day length. For example, if the natural day length is nine hours and you desire a 14-hour photoperiod, you would keep the lights operating after dusk for about 5½ hours (an extra half-hour for “insurance” against sunset/dusk). When using low-intensity light (i.e. 10 f.c. or 2 µmol·m−2·s−1) to extend the day length, there’s really no additional photosynthetic or supplemental light being provided. However, many growers operate their HPS lamps in the evening and, depending on the light intensity and duration of operation, this can act as both photoperiodic and supplemental light.\nNight interruption (NI) lighting, or “mum lighting,” is the practice of providing low-intensity photoperiodic lighting to plants during the middle of the night. By interrupting the dark period, the plant won’t perceive a long night, but a short night (i.e., long day) instead. NI lighting is typically delivered during the middle of the night (such as from 10:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m.) because plants are most sensitive to light at this time.\nTypically, four hours of NI lighting is sufficient for plants that demonstrate an LD response. Most growers provide continuous light during the NI process to ensure a long-day response. However, continuous light during the NI isn’t absolutely necessary for plants to perceive a long day.\nCyclic or intermittent lighting is an alternative lighting strategy that can reduce equipment and energy costs by reducing the number of ballasts and lamps and power consumption, respectively. Cyclical lighting involves using periodic lighting in the middle of the night, such as light on for five minutes every 20 minutes during a 4-hour period. Generally speaking, plants need to receive at least 10 f.c. (~2 µmol·m−2·s−1) for a minimum of five minutes every half hour. This may reduce the overall amount of energy required to elicit an LD response by up to 83%, although some crops may flower later compared to plants under continuous 4-hour lighting.\nLamp types/light sources\nThere are several options you have when looking at light sources for use in photoperiodic lighting, each with advantages and disadvantages.\nIncandescent bulbs. These are commonly used in greenhouses to provide DE and/or NI lighting. Incandescent lights may be used for cyclic lighting because the frequent on-and-off won’t negatively affect bulb life or fixture longevity. Incandescent bulbs are inexpensive and emit an effective spectrum, but they’re very energy inefficient and require high power availability. Screw-in compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) are an attractive alternative to traditional incandescent lamps for DE and NI lighting. While CFLs are more energy-efficient and effective for use on many crops, their spectrum isn’t as effective at controlling flowering of some LD plants. CFLs are low in far-red (FR) light, which is required for rapid flowering of some LD crops, including pansy and petunia. One strategy to take advantage of the energy-saving CFL and the FR-rich incandescent bulb is to alternate CFL with incandescent bulbs in fixtures within the greenhouse. This will provide the required light quality for effective photoperiodic lighting and still achieve some energy\nHigh-intensity discharge (HID) lamps. HID lamps, such as metal halide and HPS lamps, may also be used effectively. There are several ways to use these lamps to provide DE and NI lighting. Most commonly, HPS lamps are suspended above the crop. Another method is to mount HPS lamps on booms that move over the crop. The newest development in HPS lamps is to use an oscillating reflector (Figure 2). When using an HID lamp, such as HPS lamps for photoperiodic lighting, you may be providing supplemental or photosynthetic light as well, depending on the intensity of the light and the hours of operation. See the article in the March 2014 issue of GrowerTalks on supplemental lighting for more information.\nFigure 3. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are a new technology with great promise for use in photoperiodic lighting.\nLight-emitting diodes (LEDs). This technology is an emerging light source with promising plant applications, including the regulations of flowering (Figure 3). Their long lifespan, energy efficiency, and ability to target specific wavelengths of light make them a viable option for managing photoperiod. LEDs also provide the opportunity to adjust the ratio of red (R) and FR light for desired plant responses. The best combination of R/FR is being studied at Michigan State University, but we do know that far-red light is important in promoting flowering in LD plants. Currently, there are LED bulbs that are on the market for use in photoperiodic lighting that contain both R and FR and are being met with success in some greenhouses.\nManaging the photoperiod is an important aspect of greenhouse environmental management. By understanding the natural photoperiod and the techniques used to manipulate photoperiod, you can achieve desired plant responses, such as accelerate flowering and reach target market dates more reliably. Hopefully, this two-part series has helped “shed some light” on the differences between supplemental and photoperiodic lighting so you can better achieve your goals in your greenhouse.

Human activities – such as burning fossil fuels and hazardous waste, and the improper disposal of mercury containing products – have greatly increased the amount of mercury contamination in the environment.\nWhere is Mercury Found Around the House?\nMercury can be liquid or gaseous. In both forms, it’s just as dangerous.\nYou can find mercury in…\n- Fluorescent light bulbs\n- Glass thermometers\n- Some older light switches\n- Older household thermostats\n- Some metallic jewelry\n- Children’s shoes (with flickering lights)\n- Some toys with flashing lights\n- Clothing irons\n- Some clock pendulums\n- Older oil-based paints\n- Button batteries (watch-type batteries)\nFluorescent and High-Intensity Discharge (HID) lamps are excellent energy-efficient choices because they can use up to 50 percent less electricity. However, used fluorescent and HID lamps must be disposed of properly because they contain mercury.\nThe Dangers of Mercury\nMercury is a highly toxic metal that is harmful to both humans and wildlife. Exposure to even small amounts of mercury, over a long period of time, may cause negative health effects including damage to the brain, kidneys, and lungs.\nUnborn and young children are especially susceptible to mercury exposure because their nervous systems are still developing. Whether it is absorbed through the skin, inhaled, or ingested, exposure to mercury should be taken very seriously.\nBrief contact with high levels of mercury may cause immediate health effects:\n- Abdominal cramps\n- Eye irritation\n- Loss of appetite\n- Weight loss\n- Skin rashes\n- Muscle tremors\nProper Storage and Disposal\nProper storage and disposal of mercury-containing products will greatly reduce the risk of exposure in your home. Store products containing mercury in a safe place to prevent breakage.\nCarefully handle and dispose of those products by taking them to the Delta Household Hazardous Waste Collection Facility for free and proper disposal.\nIf There’s a Spill\nAll mercury spills, regardless of size, should be cleaned up immediately and carefully.

These goods are placed on pallets which have standard ISO sized pallet racks. The buildings typically have docks for loading and unloading goods from trucks, and some warehouses are specifically designed to handle goods directly from seaports, airports and railway.	"['Warehouses are buildings for storing merchandises. These buildings are used by manufacturers, importers, exporters, wholesalers, transport industries, customs, etc. Previously they used to be large and plain buildings either on industrial sites or outskirts of cities, towns or villages.\nThey have docks for loading and unloading goods from trucks. Some of these warehouses are designed to load and unload goods directly from seaports, airports and railway. These warehouses are industrial buildings and have handling techniques such as cranes and forklifts to move goods within the buildings. These goods are placed on pallets which have a standard ISO sized pallet racks. The goods stored in a warehouse can be either raw materials or finished goods. In India, a warehouse is often referred to as a godown.\nVarious types of warehouses include, storage warehouse, retail warehouse, cold storage, distribution centres also known as fulfilment centres and flex spaces.2\nThese warehouses contain goods for home trade especially finished goods.\nCold storage warehouses\nThese are warehouses dedicated to preserving agricultural products and such warehouses are also called cold storages. These temperature controlled warehouses eliminates insect damage to products and prevents sprouting or rotting. Goods are not stored for more than a year. These warehouses use Ammonia and Freon compressors to maintain required temperature as it is cheap and has high latent heat of evaporation.\nMostly for wholesale trade, these warehouses are for overseas trade.\nThese warehouses have a specific function of packing of goods. Other processes involved here are picking, checking, classification and labelling.\nThese warehouses are especially built close to the railway hubs\nCanal warehouses were used for trans-shipment and storage. Examples of this type are Castlefield warehouses at the terminus of the Bridgewater Canal in 1761.\nReference: Harris, Cyril M. (2006). ""Warehouse"".

33	ways to stop allergies medicine	The primary treatment for allergies is anti-histamines, particularly second-generation antihistamines which are less sedating and have longer duration of action. Other treatments include decongestants and allergy shots. For severe anaphylactic reactions, epinephrine injection is used. Additionally, it's recommended to minimize exposure to allergens - for food allergies, completely exclude the food from diet; for dust or pollen allergies, wear masks outside and avoid dusty, overcrowded places.	['The Biomarker Handbook is a curated series that seeks to provide readers with insights on each biomarker we cover in our blood test packages and its relation to our body.\nHalf a century ago, the discovery of the first immunoglobulin E (IgE) was made. Since then, extensive follow-up research has led us to understand what IgE does in the body and how it plays its part in being an important biomarker for allergies and parasitic infections.\nThe Physiology of IgE\nIgE is a protein; more specifically an antibody. Like the other five in its class, it is produced by the B-lymphocytes. These white blood cells are responsible for the production of all of the immunoglobulins. Their production is stimulated by a particular antigen which is specific for each class of antibody.\nThe main role of immunoglobulins, including IgE, is in the host defence mechanism and immune response of our body against different pathogens.\nIn a normal state of health, the total IgE in the blood is found in low levels. However, in certain circumstances these serum levels can increase, insinuating an underlying disease condition requiring further investigation.\nIgE – an Important Allergic Biomarker\nPerhaps the primary role of IgE is in allergies. During an allergic reaction, allergens and other antigenic particles trigger the release of IgE from B-lymphocytes. The level of circulating IgE, thus, increases and this immunoglobulin is responsible for a chain of events that lead to the release of histamine that causes the horrible signs and symptoms of an allergy.\nA typical allergic reaction includes a runny nose, watery eyes, skin itching and rash, constriction of the bronchi, uncommonly vomiting and diarrhoea and sometimes even a fatal anaphylactic reaction. It is important to recognise the signs of an allergic reaction. If left untreated, these symptoms can exacerbate and become potentially life-threatening.\nThe first time the allergen is introduced to the body and the specific IgE antibodies are produced, the immune response is slow. This first exposure, also known as sensitisation, sensitises white blood cells to the specific allergen in question. However, re-exposure triggers an immediate hypersensitivity reaction with greater symptoms than that seen with the first exposure.\nIgE levels in the serum are also markedly increased in cases of asthma and hay fever.\nIgE for Parasitic Infections\nParasitic or helminthic infections are also a cause of increased IgE levels in the blood. When a parasitic infection occurs, the immune system responds by the activation of eosinophils and platelets, both of which are thought to be induced by circulating IgE. Studies have found that people that are deficient in this antibody have longer recovery periods for parasitic infections like Schistosomiasis than those who have normal IgE in the blood.\nTesting for Total IgE\nThe total IgE blood test is a non-specific screening test that is used to detect the presence of allergy. The total IgE test measures the total amount of circulating IgE in the body but does not exactly pinpoint to which allergen is causing the particular allergic reaction.\nIf the level of IgE is found higher than the normal upper limit, it could indicate an allergy or a parasitic infection and even asthma.\nOn rare occasions, a total IgE test may be used to diagnose Job syndrome. This syndrome is an inherited disease characterised by constantly high levels of IgE in the blood, recurrent infections, bone defects and eczema. The total IgE test is also sometimes useful in diagnosing multiple myeloma.\nOn the other hand, sometimes a total IgE test may fail to detect an allergy because of naturally lower than normal IgE levels in the blood of certain people. In these cases, a screening test may not be as helpful as an allergen-specific IgE test.\nAllergen-Specific IgE Tests\nSince the Total IgE test does not help in identifying the specific allergy and merely tells us of the presence or absence of it, an allergen-specific IgE test is much more useful in finding out the cause of allergy. This test makes use of IgE-specific immunoassay methods as well as the RAST test. Suspected allergens are grouped and introduced in this test to find the cause of allergy.\nWhen the total IgE test is normal but the clinical picture strongly suggests an allergic reaction, it is highly recommended to perform allergen-specific IgE tests.\nUsually, the symptoms of allergies are easily identifiable but even when there is a suspicion, it is best to check in with your doctor. The first-line treatment medications for allergies are anti-histamines. This group of drugs blocks the release of histamine from the IgE stimulated mast cells and basophils, thus reversing constriction of the bronchi, sneezing, running nose and watery eyes. Currently, second-generation antihistamines are preferred over the first generation because of the less sedating side effects and the longer duration of action.\nOther drugs that are commonly prescribed to manage allergies are decongestants and sometimes, allergy shots. In fatal anaphylactic reactions, life-saving interventions and an epinephrine injection is given to save the patient from a respiratory collapse.\nIt is also recommended to minimise the exposure to the allergen as much as possible. If it is a food allergy you’re suffering from, the particular food should be completely excluded from the diet. If it is dust or pollen allergy, masks should be worn outside and dusty, overcrowded places should be avoided.\nWhy is Screening for Allergies Important?\nThe prevalence of allergy worldwide is high. Allergic rhinitis affects up to 30% of the population. Sensitization (IgE) antibodies to foreign proteins in the environment are present in 40% of individuals.\nA total IgE screening test can quickly identify whether you have any allergies or a parasitic infection. Scheduled screening tests throughout the year are necessary to keep allergies in check and take quick action in managing them before they become a misery. Consult with your doctor as soon as you notice the slightest symptoms of an allergy for early treatment and recovery.\nIf you want to find out more about how you can diagnose your allergies, take a look at our lifestyle article here!\nInterested in other biomarkers?

Planned to ski the lower angle bowl to the looker’s left of the Harp summit. Shortly after starting our skin up the traditional left approach we encountered a huge debris field (at least D3) [forecaster note: avalanche estimated at D2.5] that filled and eliminated the normal left creek drainage. Debris was soft and rounded and we assumed it had run around/after the most recent storm cycle that closed Arctic Valley. Continued skinning up the debris path which widened above the terrain trap and filled most of the lower bowl. We could make out (by headlamp) that it came from the ridge on the looker’s right side of Harp. Traversed the debris field to continue on up towards the left bowl but turned around due to snowpack conditions (dense ~1ft. slab on top of progressively less dense snow on top of large facets) and steepening terrain. Also left bowl looked to have slid at some point as well. On our way down we encountered a guy who reported the massive slide we encountered and assumed was old in fact took place around 6 pm this evening, was skier triggered and buried/killed a dog. He reported he helped look for the dog but they were unsuccessful. Both skiers involved were apparently fine.\nFrom another witness that evening:\nIt was way gnarly to be able to experience this first hand, I was just putting on my boots next thing I know my car was in engulfed in a huge powder cloud. Some of the slabs were more than a foot thick, it ran probably 1000-1500 feet [forecaster note: estimated to have run ~2000′], debris pile was approximentaly 10 feet deep, both skiers did not take the ride [forecaster note: according to involved party the triggering human took a ~1000′ ride]; however, their dog did and was not found. RIP\nPhotos of the avalanche taken the next day (2/26/16):\nThis path is a repeat offender (there are 3-4 in this zone of Harp Mountain) and can relatively reliably be triggered when freshly wind loaded and unstable, usually initiating from from the rock outcrop trigger point protruding from the looker’s right flank crown:\nObservations from the involved party (from CNFAIC):\nWe had been skiing Harp Mountain regularly for the preceding several weeks in fine, stable conditions, and on Thursday we were hoping to catch what we’d come to perceive as a casual evening lap. The Arctic Valley weather station recorded consistent below freezing temperatures since the warming trend in town. Based on the weather data and our recent experience on Harp we wrongly committed to the notion that despite the recent sustained high winds, the snow might be fine.\nWe skinned around the fence at the end of Hiland Road to access the terrain just north of Back Bowl, and continued up the face. We were primarily focused on skinning up and skiing down before dark, and brushed off the marginal snow conditions as potentially frustrating but not dangerous. Intermittent boilerplate, breakable crust, and windblown powder characterized the snow surface. We switchbacked straight up the bowl, stopping just below the ridge. Adrian traversed south across a snow-free rib to set up for our descent while I ate a snack and waited north of the rib for his report.\nImmediately after crossing the rib Adrian triggered a wind slab avalanche. The slab detached at a ~2-4 foot thick crown, and both he and his dog Susie became entrained in the debris. The slab propagated across the northeast facing slope along a ~1 km crown. I tried to maintain sight of Adrian in the debris as he slid ~1000 feet down and into the prominent terrain trap gully at the north margin of the west-facing bowl.\nI pulled my skins off and made 2 or 3 turns onto the bed surface of the slide before I heard Adrian yelling: “I’m alive! I’m ok!”. He was on the surface, uninjured, missing one ski and both poles when the avalanche stopped moving. Susie, Adrian’s dog, had also been caught in the slide but was not accounted for.\nI skied down to Adrian and we began switchbacking the debris field looking for Susie. We descended another ~1000 feet to the toe of the debris, which reached nearly to Hiland Rd. We switched our beacons to search during our descent on the off chance that skiers may have ascended our track behind us. When we returned to the road there was a new car and skin track merging with our own. We flagged down a car and Adrian, with residents of the house at the end of the road, contacted the state troopers and began preparing for a search. I skinned back up to start searching by headlamp. I encountered the driver of the car about 10 mintues from the road, setting up camp south of the avalanche path.\nSusie was not recovered. All people were uninjured and accounted for and the report was closed with the troopers.\n[forecaster note: avalanche estimated to have started at ~4400′ with width ~200′ and length ~2000′]\n|Trigger||Skier||Avalanche Type||Hard Slab||Aspect||West Northwest|\n|Elevation||4800ft||Slope Angle||35deg||Crown Depth||4ft|\nIsothermal snow at road.

35	How do shipping container restrooms and porta-potties compare in their ability to handle extreme weather conditions, particularly during freezing temperatures or intense heat?	In extreme weather conditions, shipping container restrooms perform significantly better than porta-potties. During freezing temperatures, porta-potties can become problematic as waste water can freeze, creating service difficulties and project delays. Shipping container bathrooms avoid this issue because their plumbing is insulated within the container, preventing frozen pipes. In hot weather, porta-potties become particularly unpleasant as they have minimal ventilation and heat enters faster than it can vent out, creating greenhouse-like conditions. Additionally, heat intensifies odor issues with raw sewage. In contrast, shipping container restrooms are equipped with HVAC systems that maintain room temperature and ventilation fans that help control odors.	['Porta-Potties vs. Shipping Container Restroom Buildings\nPaige Welsh | Mar 8, 2018\nEvery workplace needs toilets. While most workplaces have the convenience of bathrooms right in their offices, industries that operate in remote environments like oil and gas need mobile solutions that can travel with the jobsite. Porta-potties are a cost-effective choice, but there are situations where investing in a more durable (and less odorous) option, like a shipping container-based restroom building, can improve morale and lower employee turnover.\nTo help inform your decision, here are a few mobile bathroom basics.\n|Shipping Container Restroom Building\n|Has no plumbing; waste collects in a vat below; no running water\n|Uses standard flush toilets; plumbing is inside the container, beneath the flooring; includes sinks with running water\n|Neutralized (somewhat) by a blue anti-bacterial liquid\n|Ventilation fans and flushing toilets control odors\n|Vents in ceiling offer minimal cooling\n|HVAC systems keep restrooms at room temperature\n|Most rental companies offer services that pump each unit once a week\n|Waste water exits the container out of a standard plumbing hook-up, like an RV; may be connected to sewer line or holding tanks\n|Most rental companies offer services that clean each unit once a week\n|Slip-resistant floors and easy to clean walls enable deep cleaning (draining floors optional)\n|Minimal; site must be level\n|Onsite holding tanks or sewer tanks required if sewer line is unavailable; site must be level\n|Light weight and easy to load in a truck\n|Lift from flatbed truck with a forklift or crane or use a tiltbed truck\n|Usually each porta-potty rents for around $200 a month\n|Cost can be recuperated over a long time period\nBased on the chart above, you can see that both mobile bathroom solutions have their pros and cons. To determine your business’s specific needs, ask yourself the following questions:\n1. How many toilets do I need?\nOSHA mandates that employers provide at least one toilet seat and one urinal per 40 employees at construction sites; many employers choose to use more to create a more convenient workplace for employees. A standard 40-foot shipping container includes five toilets and four urinals. Thus, a jobsite with 160 full time employees calls for at least one shipping container restroom building or four porta-potties.\n2. How long will employees be using mobile bathrooms?\nFor short term projects, the cost-efficiency and outsourced maintenance of porta-potties is hard to beat. However, if your employees will be using the restrooms for several months or even years, the unpleasantness of porta-potties will begin to chip away at their morale.\nCase in point: employees appreciated clean bathrooms so much that one of our customers in the oil and gas industry purchased containerized bathrooms to prevent competitors from poaching their workers. The investment proved worthwhile; they found that employees were less likely to quit when they could use a clean, odor-free, and climate-controlled bathroom on their breaks.\n3. Do you anticipate freezing weather?\nIn mild temperatures, porta potties are reasonably easy to service, but what if your jobsite is prone to freezing temperatures?\nIf the waste water freezes into an unsavory popsicle, cleaning porta-potties suddenly becomes an ordeal. Aside from the “ick” factor, waiting for the toilets to be fixed creates anxiety-inducing delays to your project’s schedule. If freezing weather is a concern at your jobsite, shipping container bathrooms can save you a lot of hassle because the compartment beneath the flooring that holds plumbing is insulated within the container, preventing frozen pipes.\n4. Do you anticipate sweltering heat?\nAnyone who has attended a summer music festival can attest that no amount of blue porta potty water can quite mask the smell of raw sewage. Minimal ventilation also turns porta-potties into the worst kind of greenhouse as summer heat enters faster than it vents out. If your employees dread using the bathroom in the summer months, they’ll let you know about it or even begin to wonder if there are other job opportunities that offer better amenities.\n5. Will there be extremely windy conditions?\nFor obvious reasons, a tipped over porta-potty is unusable until cleaned. You can stake down porta-potties, but gusty storms or vandals with a terrible sense of humor always pose a risk for a tip-over. A steel container bathroom that weights over ten thousand pounds is much less likely to be rolled by a storm or person.\nWith these considerations in mind, we hope you’re able to make a decision about your bathrooms that balances cost, efficiency and employee comfort.

Today, masters like Tamara Hlushenok, a National Artist of Ukraine, preserve this cultural heritage by teaching visitors the traditional techniques of egg-painting in studios, including pattern drawing, hot wax coating, and color dipping. The art combines both pagan and Christian symbolism in its designs.	['Preserving Ukraine’s Cultural Heritage And How You Can Help\nFor 35 years we have promoted peace through international travel to Ukraine, among other destinations. In the way we travel – and the reason many of you travel with us – it’s all about connecting with people, and with their cultures. Through such connections we discover more about the world – and about ourselves.\nUkrainians are fighting for their homes and families, for their territorial integrity, for the democratic values we all cherish and for their cultural heritage. Culture is essential in so many ways. Teaching us to appreciate our own and other world cultures, to live compassionately and come to understand what we have in common with one another – culture can be a catalyst for peace.\nYou may have read about the Ukrainian ballet dancers who continue to perform in Paris, and the efforts by UNESCO and those of the Cultural Heritage Monitoring Lab, all notable and noble cultural heritage preservation efforts we applaud – and no doubt there are countless others.\nThank you to those who have read our posts MIR Stands with Ukraine and On Ukraine and Prayers for Peace and have already made donations to aid Ukraine. We so appreciate your calls and emails, and any and all contributions made. We continue to be humbled by the bravery of the Ukrainians on the battlefield, and beyond and uplifted by the generosity of Ukraine’s neighbors and those here in the U.S. and around the world who are supporting Ukraine.\nWe continue to support the resilient spirit and cultural heritage of the Ukrainian nation and we’ve heard from many of you seeking suggestions for how to do the same – in a direct manner. In addition to international non-profits we’ve donated to, we have also directly supported three Ukrainian families doing what they can individually to support their beloved homeland.\nWe’d like to introduce you to these three families who have dedicated their careers to preserving Ukrainian culture and tradition by sharing it with the world in their own grassroots ways – and who are intent on helping their nation in any way possible.

She has hosted many of MIR’s guests in her Kyiv studio and taught many a visitor the finer aspects of Ukrainian egg painting traditions: from drawing the pattern, to coating the egg in hot wax to dipping it in colors. Literally translated as egg-writing, this traditional craft has been elevated to an art in Ukraine. Each pattern has a different meaning, some of them dating back to pagan times. Tamara has had to relocate to the Transcarpathian region for the time being.\nTamara’s daughter Olga is based in Lviv, and works with a non-profit currently purchasing essential medical supplies via Poland and transporting them back to Kyiv for local distribution to area hospitals, where it has become nearly impossible to obtain urgently needed supplies.\nTranscarpathia Region Volunteers\nIvan, Lesya & daughter [Photo Credit: Lesya Berkala]\nIvan & Lesya head up a group of volunteers based in Rakhiv, Luba’s hometown in the Transcarpathian region.

[Photo credit: Luba]', 'Ukrainian Easter Egg (Pysanka) – Tradition And Design\nOnce the winter season is nearing its end, the days become longer, the sun feels warmer, and the earth wakes up and shows signs of new life, we also feel refreshed and ready to celebrate spring. Some of the more popular spring celebrations in the United States include the visit by the Easter Bunny, Easter Egg Decorating, and Easter Egg Hunt.\nOur family celebrates spring with preparations for Easter Sunday Holiday and decorating of Easter Eggs. There are many ways to decorate eggs, such us coloring them with edible dyes in all different pastel colors, placing colorful stickers, beads, ribbons, etc. on eggs, drawing designs with markers, etc. There is also a very intricate egg decorating style, which I will introduce you to, and that is the Ukrainian Easter Egg, Pysanka, design.\nMy parents were my first mentors, and story tellers, about this old tradition, which was very popular in their native countries, Ukraine and Poland, and it continues to thrive in the Diaspora.\nEgg decorating tradition dates back to pagan times, well over 2000 years before the time of Christ. People believed that great power was embodied in the egg, so they decorated eggs in the spring to celebrate the warmth of the sun which in turn brought back the joy and vigor to life, after the cold winter months. Decorated eggs were used by well wishers for good luck, prosperity, and even fertility. Single girls would make sure to have a nice collections of freshly decorated Easter Eggs to present to every young man who would visit their home during Easter time. Also, on Easter Monday (still being an Easter Holiday in Ukraine and Poland) if girls ran out or Easter Eggs to give away as gifts, their male friends would bring them outside, and drench them with buckets of water. This custom has died out somewhat, but children, especially boys, still have fun spraying the girls with water held in specially designed color plastic eggs with a sprayer top. There also was an old legend that if you are lucky enough to preserve an Easter Egg for 100 years, the insides will dry out and turn into a diamond. The 80 year old Easter Eggs I have in my collections, will definitely not prove this legend right or wrong, since these eggs are hollowed out, actually to my advantage (believe me, you don’t want one of these old whole eggs crack open on you….).\nWith the introduction of Christianity, the ancient customs were absorbed into the Christian celebration of Christ’s Resurrection. The new meanings expressed in the design, blended harmoniously with the old, so today the decorated eggs display a mixture of the pagan and the Christian symbolism in their design.\nUkrainian Easter Egg decorating is very intricate, since it requires the use of hot liquefied beeswax, flowing through a stylus, kistka, a metal funnel like vessel attached to a wooden, pencil like, handle, with which the artist is outlining a design on the shell of a raw white egg. The color usage sequence is extremely important in Ukrainian Easter Egg decorating, to capture the most vibrant colors in the design of the final product, so it requires very thoughtful planning of the design as the first step, before starting to decorate the egg.\nThere are four basic colors used in Ukrainian Easter Egg decorating: yellow, orange, red, and black. Of course, there are numerous other colors incorporated in small amounts into the design, and some styles require other major colors, but the main four colors are almost always found in all designs. What makes the Ukrainian Easter Eggs different from other designs, is the geometric pattern used in majority of the designs.\nThe design elements also have a symbolic meaning, pagan and Christian, and here are some examples:\n- Flowers – symbol of love, charity, good will\n- Wheat – symbol of good health, and wishes for bountiful harvest\n- Storks, chicks, hens, roosters – symbol of fertility\n- Triangles – symbol of trinity (air, fire, water; heaven, earth, hell; father, mother, child; sun, thunder, bonfire; Father, Son, Holy Spirit)\n- Net – symbol of “fishers of men”, used in Christianity\n- Pine needles – symbol of long life, youth, and health\n- Sun and stars – symbol of life itself, growth, good fortune\n- Various forms of ribbons – symbol of never ending line representing everlasting life\nNow that I have introduced you to the egg decorating tradition, and a brief description of the Ukrainian Easter Egg decorating style, my next post will describe this process step by step, so stay tuned until then.']	['<urn:uuid:1f69d55f-5113-4e6a-9f9c-14ca1914c961>', '<urn:uuid:d82269bd-042f-419c-9d70-bfd9f9cd4216>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	6	59	1806
37	How do dams in Washington and Cuyahoga affect water quality?	In both locations, dams have negative impacts on water quality. In the Cuyahoga River, dams reduce dissolved oxygen, trap toxins, increase algal growth, vary water temperature and interfere with many biological processes. In Washington State, dams fragment habitats and block migrating animals from reaching important spawning and feeding grounds, leading to decline in ecosystem quality.	['All Things Dams\n- Dam Busting and FOCR: An Overview\n- Dams, a Proud Cuyahoga History\n- Akron Water Supply\n- Uses of Dams\n- Environmental Impact of Dams\n- Bringing Down the Dams\n- Dams Down\n- Dams to Go\n- Resources & News\nDams, a Proud Cuyahoga History\nOnce, dams dotted the Cuyahoga River and its tributaries. Early settlers built dams to grind grain and divert water for agriculture. In the 1820’s, dams were installed to channel water from the river into the Ohio & Erie Canal. Until the advent of the railroads in 1850’s, the canal was the major route of transporting goods to Lake Erie and Ohio River. The industrial age brought new needs for dams and water. Dams popped up next to factories so they could use the Cuyahoga’s water for processing, cooling and power. Two hydroelectric dams were built in Cuyahoga Falls to capture the prospective power of the river’s flow.\nAkron Water Supply\nLarge dams were built in the Cuyahoga system to back-up water for residential and industrial use. In 1912, the City of Akron built the Lake Rockwell dam on the Cuyahoga River at Kent. This system in the upper Cuyahoga was expanded with two additional dams in 1932 and 1961. Currently, this system provides water for approximately 300,000 residents. Dams in the Portage Lakes area were originally built for additional industrial water. Now those dams are used for flood control and recreation. For more information about the City of Akron’s water supply, click here.\nUses of Dams\nPrior to our understanding of the substantial environmental impacts of dams and before our mid-twentieth century water quality crisis, society viewed dams as strictly beneficial and built them to accommodate a variety of needs. Many of those uses are mentioned above. As more dependable and less impactful methods were established for these purposes, most of the dams on the Cuyahoga became obsolete.\nFriends of the Crooked River supports the removal or modification of all obsolete dams on the Cuyahoga River and its tributaries, where those removals are feasible. Click here for a summary of obsolete dams on the Cuyahoga.\nEnvironmental Impacts of Dams\nBy their nature, dams are temporary structures on rivers. They have a limited life span as time and the river will eventually lead to their end. While these barriers are intact, they negatively impact water quality significantly. They reduce dissolved oxygen, modify flow, trap toxins, prevent fish passage, interfere with sediment transport, alter the aquatic food web, increase algal growth, reduce benthic populations, vary water temperature and obstruct many inherent biological and chemical processes. Dams radically and negatively affect overall chemical water quality and aquatic life. In addition, the hydraulic waves created immediately downstream are death traps for paddlers and swimmers. For more on dams, see Dam Removal Project Overview (link to file in folder) Also visit, American Rivers.\nBringing down the Dams\nYou can’t just wake up one morning and decide to take down a dam. Dam removal is a process involving many studies that take years to complete and evaluate. Use analysis, historic valuation, biological surveys, geologic reviews, engineering studies, hydraulic impacts and cost estimates are just a few of the issues that must be formally reviewed. There are permits that must be obtained, stakeholder committees that must be formed, public support that must be built and costs that must be raised. The four completed Cuyahoga dam removals are a testament to years of hard work by countless individuals at a total cost of $8.6 Million.\nIn the1990’s, under the direction of Ohio EPA, stakeholders began to study the effects of dams on the water quality of the middle Cuyahoga River. As a result of these efforts, the Middle Cuyahoga River Stakeholder’s committee was formed in 1999 and in 2000, produced an Ohio EPA report, the Middle Cuyahoga River TMDL. This report noted that the major causes of nonattainment of aquatic life standards in this 10-mile stretch of river were related to dams.\nAs a result, the dams at Kent and Munroe Falls were evaluated for removal and a minimum water release was mandated for Lake Rockwell. In 2005, the Kent dam was modified, creating one of most attractive and interesting public parks in Ohio. This internationally award-winning design set the tone for city’s economic and beautification efforts. In 2006, the Munroe Falls dam was removed and Brust Park created. Once inaccessible to the public, this new park is the site of festivals where thousands of people delight in the fishable, swimmable benefits of dam removal.\nFor a more technical and totally fascinating summary of these dams, see Case Studies of Dam Removal.\nDam removal fever had hit the Cuyahoga in big way. The City of Cuyahoga Falls’ Mayor Don Robart, a great fan of the Cuyahoga River and its water quality, was favorably impressed with the results of the dam removal efforts upstream of his city. He led the way to remover two dams in 2013. Cuyahoga Falls Dam Removal Summary (PDF)\nWatch a 2 minute video of the demolition to the tune of the William Tell Overture:\nThe removal and modification of these dams produced nearly immediate benefits including water quality improvements, public parks, canoe and kayak facilities and dramatic increase in public use of the river and its adjacent lands. Multi-purpose trails stretch to meet each other along the river’s edge. And a region-wide effort began to establish the Cuyahoga River Water Trail. Economic interests developed to take advantage of the scenic beauty, recreational opportunities and public access created by the dam removals.\nDams to Go\nWhen all of the obsolete dams come tumbling down, it will be a magnificent victory for the River and people who will enjoy its benefits. We will have come full circle on understanding the true power of our River, sustaining its living systems.\nBecome a Dam Buster', 'Native lamprey making a comeback in Washington State after dam removal\nHydroelectric power is one of the cleanest energy sources available. Washington State is the United States’ leading producer of hydroelectric power, which generates about 75% of the State’s energy. Although it is a renewable and a comparatively clean power source, hydroelectric projects can have significant environmental impacts on aquatic organisms and their habitats.\nDams in a river can block migrating animals from reaching areas that are important to their life cycle, such as spawning or feeding grounds. This can lead to something called habitat fragmentation, a phenomenon in ecology in which an organism’s habitat is divided into small discontinuous patches either through natural or human-caused processes. When a watershed becomes too fragmented by damming projects, both the number and amount of different organisms occupying the watershed tend to decline and the quality of the natural area degrades. This can lead to losses in ecosystem services, functions of an ecosystem we benefit from, such as fishing or recreation. In many cases organisms with specific regional and cultural importance suffer as a result.\nPacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus) are a culturally important organism to Native American tribes in the Pacific Northwest. Native peoples of the Columbia River Basin historically valued Pacific lamprey as a plentiful food source and still regard them as an important part of their traditions and culture today. However over the last century, Pacific lamprey in the Columbia River Basin have lost access to much of their native range and their numbers have declined.\nThe precipitous declines in Pacific lamprey populations has been understudied, but their inability to migrate due to the presence of large damming projects has been implicated in their decline more than any other possible cause. In response to their declining population, interest in removing outdated dams that no longer serve their intended purpose has gained traction in efforts to aid conservation of migrating aquatic animals like the Pacific lamprey. However, the response of Pacific lamprey populations to dam removals has not been well studied. For that reason, a team of researchers led by Dr. Jeffrey Jolley of the U.S. Geological Survey conducted a study to monitor a Pacific lamprey population’s response to the removal of Condit Dam in the White Salmon River of south-central Washington (Figure 1).\nThe Condit Dam was a hydroelectric dam constructed in 1913 and was a complete barrier to migrating Pacific lamprey and other fish until it was removed in 2012. Dr. Jolley and his team estimated lamprey larval abundance before and after the dam removal by taking samples of the larval population using backpack electrofishers (Figure 2). They calculated the probability of detecting lamprey using their sampling method and refined their approach until they reached 80% confidence that when they did not find any larvae, none were actually present. In this way, they could be highly confident that their sampling method was accurately sampling the population at the site.\nThey found no lamprey upstream of the dam before it was removed but lampreys were present\ndownstream from the dam (Figure 3). After the dam was removed, lamprey were found in four locations above the dam removal site where they were previously absent. This indicated to the team that natural recolonization of the White Salmon River was happening just a few years after the dam’s removal. I asked Dr. Jolley about his reaction to finding Pacific lamprey:\n“We had captured a number of a very small lamprey which were likely age-0 or age-1 fish in the mainstem White Salmon River but they were too small to visually identify. We totally figured those were the resident non-migratory Western Brook Lamprey but we always sent off our genetic fin clips for fish that small. It was months later when I got an e-mail from our collaborating geneticist. I said ‘No Way!’. We quickly pored through our records to triple-check everything for errors but I wanted to be completely positive about this. Turns out they were Pacific lamprey – I smiled a lot that day.”\nAdditionally, lamprey were not found at the river’s mouth prior to dam removal but the researchers noticed that after the dam was removed, new habitat of fine sediment was formed at the river mouth and larval lamprey were found there.\nThe work done by Dr. Jolley and colleagues adds to the abundance of literature on the positive conservation impacts of dam removals. On the project Dr. Jolley said:\n“This was a large dam removal. There are many, many small dams and passage barriers to Pacific Lamprey out there. It would be great for the lamprey to remove some of these. At times we just need to get out of the way and the lamprey will figure out the rest.”\nAllowing natural recolonization of areas by removing unnecessary impediments can greatly improve conservation efforts for organisms such as Pacific lamprey, even in cases where their migrations have been blocked for nearly a century.\nJolley, J.

38	Do both prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic organelles contain their own DNA?	Yes, both have their own DNA. Prokaryotic cells have DNA distributed in their cytoplasm, while organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts contain their own circular DNA and ribosomes, similar to bacteria.	"['Figure 2:A chloroplast\n© 2010 lifwynnfoundation.org education All civil liberties reserved.\nWhat specifies an Organelle?\nIn enhancement to the nucleus, eukaryoticcells might contain several other varieties of organelles, i m sorry may incorporate mitochondria, chloroplasts, the endoplasmic reticulum,the Golgi apparatus, and also lysosomes. Every of this organelles performs a specificfunction an essential to the cell""s survival. Moreover, almost all eukaryoticorganelles room separated native the remainder of the cellular an are by a membrane, inmuch the same method that internal walls separate the rooms in a house. Themembranes the surround eukaryotic organelles are based upon lipid bilayers that are similar (but not identical) come the cell""s outer membrane. Together,the full area that a cell""s internal membranes much exceeds that of that is plasmamembrane.\nYou are watching: Why are organelles surrounded by membranes\nLike the plasma membrane, organellemembranes role to keep the within ""in"" and also the external ""out."" This partitioningpermits different kinds the biochemical reaction to take ar in differentorganelles. Although each organelle performs a specific role in the cell,all of the cell""s organelles work-related together in an incorporated fashion to meet theoverall demands of the cell. Because that example, biochemical reaction in a cell""smitochondria transfer energy from fat acids and also pyruvate molecules right into anenergy-rich molecule referred to as adenosinetriphosphate (ATP).Subsequently, the rest of the cell""s organelles usage this ATP together the resource ofthe power they should operate.\nBecause many organelles space surroundedby membranes, they are easy to visualize — v magnification. For instance,researchers deserve to use high resolution electronmicroscopy to take a picture through a slim cross-section or slice of acell. In this way, they can see the structural information and crucial characteristicsof various organelles — such as the long, thin compartments of the endoplasmicreticulum or the compacted dyed within the nucleus. An electron micrographtherefore provides fantastic blueprint the a cell""s inner structures. Otherless an effective microscopy methods coupled with organelle-specific stains havehelped researchers watch organelle structure more clearly, as well as thedistribution of miscellaneous organelles in ~ cells. However, unlike the rooms in a house, a cell""sorganelles space not static. Rather, these structures space in continuous motion,sometimes relocating to a particular place in ~ the cell, occasionally merging withother organelles, and sometimes growing larger or smaller. This dynamicchanges in to move structures deserve to be observed with video microscopictechniques, which provide lower-resolution movies of entirety organelles as thesestructures move within cells.\nOf all eukaryotic organelles, the nucleus is perhaps the most critical. In fact, the mere visibility of a nucleus is thought about one that the specifying features of a eukaryotic bio cell. This structure is for this reason important since it is the site at i beg your pardon the cell""s DNA is housed and the process of interpreting it begins.\nRecall the DNA consists of the information compelled to develop cellular proteins. In eukaryotic cells, the membrane that surrounds the cell core — generally called the nuclear envelope — partitions this DNA from the cell""s protein synthetic machinery, i m sorry is located in the cytoplasm. Small pores in the nuclear envelope, dubbed nuclear pores, climate selectively permit particular macromolecules to enter and also leave the nucleus — including the RNA molecules that bring information indigenous a cellular DNA come protein production centers in the cytoplasm. This separation that the DNA from the protein synthetic machinery gives eukaryotic cell with more intricate regulatory manage over the production of proteins and also their RNA intermediates.\nIn contrast, the DNA of prokaryotes cells is distributed loosely about the cytoplasm, in addition to the protein synthetic machinery. This closeness permits prokaryotic cell to quickly respond to environmental readjust by quickly altering the varieties and lot of protein they manufacture. Keep in mind that eukaryotic cells likely progressed from a symbiotic relationship between two prokaryotic cells, by which one set of prokaryotes DNA eventually became separated by a nuclear envelope and formed a nucleus. Over time, sections of the DNA from the other prokaryote staying in the cytoplasmic part of the cell may or may not have been incoporated into the brand-new eukaryotic cell nucleus (Figure 3).\nSee more: Incision And Drainage Of Hematoma Cpt Code For Evacuation Of Hematoma?\nA prokaryotic hold cell incorporates one more prokaryotic cell.

39	modern factory automation networks benefits and cyber attack dangers	Modern factory automation networks offer benefits through standardized communication and interoperability: OPC UA provides secure, reliable data connectivity between machines on factory floors and enables rich information exchange across diverse systems. However, these networked systems face serious cyber attack dangers: threat actors can exploit various vulnerabilities to cause operational shutdowns, equipment damage, and financial losses. Attacks may come from competitors, insiders, or hacktivists, who can exploit weak network security architecture, inadequate access controls, unsecured protocols, and insufficient security monitoring. A successful attack can result in changes to system configurations, tampering with controllers, and manipulation of safety controls.	['The biggest hurdle for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is standardised data communication. Only when open data standards are embraced by the automation manufacturing community, can the true value and operational benefits of IIoT be realised.\nOpen wireless networks\nOne challenge which IIoT faces is the need to connect devices, often legacy ones which are not Ethernet enabled, or those which are outside the reach of cabled Ethernet networks. While IEEE 802.11 WiFi networks are one solution their range and other technical restrictions can be a barrier.\nLoRaWAN and Sigfox\nLow power, wider area open networks (LoRaWAN) can meet the increasing requirements of mass IoT applications Their combination of low device integration cost, low connectivity fees, low power, high network capacity, and long range have made them attractive to industrial applications which often require a small amount of data to be transmitted frequently.\n4G and beyond\nThere is much excitement about the arrival of 5G, but the reality for industrial applications is that 3/4G offers more than enough in terms of data rates and latency for the vast majority of industrial IoT tasks.\nCellular network coverage is continually improving and the choice of industrial cellular hardware, such as modems and routers, is continually expanding. This combined with the relatively low subscription and hardware costs makes cellular connectivity an attractive option for many IIoT projects.\nOpen data standards\nIndustrial IoT enables a broader range of technologies which have previously not been connected to IP-based networks and connects them via new, emerging networks. However, they still need a common way to communicate if the information is to be usable. Therefore, a strong case exists for standardised ‘middleware’ which can be the key enabled to this fourth industrial revolution. OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is a standard could make this a reality.\nOPC UA addresses the need for standardised data connectivity and interoperability either in machine-to-machine (M2M) data connectivity within factory floor systems or device-to-cloud or server data transfer, such as production data passing from PLCs to an ERP system. In both cases OPC UA provides a secure, reliable foundation robust enough to facilitate standards-based data connectivity and interoperability.\nThe true value of IIoT can only be fully realised if communication between devices is based on a global communication standard that can satisfy a wide range of complex requirements. This could be a high speed one-to-many broadcast communication, or a secure client/server model for bi-directional communication and control. OPC UA supports both requirements.\nBeyond simple ‘data’ sharing, a core IIoT era standard must facilitate rich information exchange, especially important when large amounts of data are pooled (aggregated) from a diverse eco system of third party systems found in typical production environments. The OPC UA standard’s object-oriented information modelling mechanisms directly fulfil this requirement while standardising the semantic data description, enabling the possibility of integration across all network layers as well as platform and vendor independence.\nIf IIoT is to become ‘business as usual’ the need to find a platform-independent data exchange standard is paramount. In many ways it’s the missing piece of the puzzle as there are numerous technologies which can help convey device level data onto a network, IO-Link being one example. However, allowing this data to be shared seamlessly and securely is vital in allowing industry to really harness the power of Industrial IoT and seize the benefits.', 'Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are found everywhere–from automated machines that manufacture goods to an office building’s cooling system.\nPreviously, it was standard that ICS were based on specific OS and specific communication protocols. However, in recent years, system development costs have been reduced and productivity has been improved by implementing network connection based on general purpose OS and standard communication protocols.\nTo compete in today’s market-driven economy, businesses and organizations opt for efficient control systems that can automatically manage processes. ICS can be found in manufacturing, processing facilities, and even power plants–which play a vital role in running a country. On the other hand, the increased efficiency that ICS introduce also presents new problems on security. In reality, threat actors have much to gain when they attack such companies. A successful attack on ICS has serious impact on any organization. Some of these effects include operational shutdowns, damaged equipment, financial loss, intellectual property theft, and substantial health and safety risks.\nMotivations for attacking ICS\nThreat actors have different motives when choosing an enterprise to target. When carrying out attacks, these threat actors are often motivated by financial gain, political cause, or even a military objective. Attacks may be state-sponsored or they could also come from competitors, insiders with a malicious goal, and even hacktivists.\nOne of the earliest examples of an ICS attack happened in 2005 when 13 DaimlerChrystler U.S. car manufacturing plants went offline for nearly an hour. The main cause was Zotob PnP worm infections that exploited a Windows Plug and Play service. The total downtime has resulted in a backlog in production costing the company thousands of dollars. While the attack was not linked to an individual or a cybercriminal group, cybercriminals may also be hired by competitors who have much to gain from the damage caused by an attack.\nHow are ICS attacked?\nThe first stage of an attack against ICS usually involves reconnaissance that allows the attacker to survey the environment. The next step would be to employ different tactics that will help attackers gain a foothold in the target network. The strategies and tactics at this point are highly similar to a targeted attack. To launch a malware, an attacker will make use of all the possible vulnerabilities and specific configurations of an ICS. Once these vulnerabilities have been identified and exploited, the effects of an attack can cause changes to certain operations and functions or adjustments to the existing controls and/or configurations.\nThe complexity of launching an attack on ICS depends on different factors, from the security of the system to the intended impact (e.g., a denial-of-service attack that disrupts the target ICS is easier to achieve than manipulating a service and concealing its immediate effects from the controllers). While there are already a lot of ways for attackers to damage an ICS, new tactics will continue to emerge as more and more devices are introduced to every ICS environment.\nWhat vulnerabilities are exploited in ICS?\nSince all ICS deal with both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT), grouping vulnerabilities by categories assists in determining and implementing mitigation strategies. The National Institute for Standards and Technology’s (NIST) security guide for ICS divides these categories into issues related to policy and procedure, as well as vulnerabilities found in various platforms (e.g., hardware, operating systems, and ICS applications), and networks.\nPolicy and Procedure Vulnerabilities\n- Inadequate security architecture and design\n- Few or no security audits of

configuration and their purpose. The size of an ICS environment can also be a factor–the bigger the environment, the greater the chance for an error to occur. An ICS environment that replaced its legacy system with modern systems and introduced tools like Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices may also have more weaknesses for threat actors to exploit.\nIndustrial IoT and How It Affects ICS\nAs ICS continue to modernize, an increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices are introduced to improve productivity and enhance system control. With the use of related IoT devices; process controls, data monitoring, and communication with other systems are made simpler. However, there are risks involved when smart devices are used for such tasks.\nIIoT incorporates machine learning and big data analysis. It also harnesses sensor data, machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, and automation technologies that have previously existed in the industrial setting. IIoT can perform tasks such as data aggregation, predictive analysis, prescriptive analysis, data value addition, and even the creation of new business models.\nSimilar to how the introduction of smart phones was followed by the rise of vulnerabilities and malware related to the platform, integrating Human Internet of Things (HIoT) and IIoT devices may create similar problems. In fact, managing IoT devices in the ICS environment can create major challenges in security, as each device will have to be properly defended and secured. Not applying adequate security leaves the entire ICS ecosystem highly vulnerable to attacks.\nWith the use of IIoT there are also a few unique challenges to overcome:\n- Technology fragmentation complicates network processes. As devices of different and/or independent operating systems are used, the varying patching schedules may be difficult to address. An example of this is when an ICS uses a mix of legacy systems and new software. Not only will the two not communicate properly, the vulnerabilities found in unpatched legacy systems may also be used by threat actors to break into an ICS network.\n- Machine to Machine (M2M) and IoT application development is difficult. Unlike manufacturing HIoT, which are mass produced, the development of M2M and IoT applications for ICS requires special skill sets on hardware and software development, IT, and communications.\n- Legacy systems and legacy communication protocols are still widely used in industrial environments. An example of legacy systems is Windows 3.1, which still runs the program DECOR (used in Airplane takeoff and landing). Then there are also legacy communications protocols that include PROFIBUS, which is still widely used today. These systems have to be integrated via standards-based protocol gateways to send and receive data and commands easier.\nAlthough hacking IoT devices may be challenging, threat actors behind targeted attacks are both knowledgeable and persistent–which could lead to successful breaches in a target’s network. In addition to this, device loss is also a major cause of data breach. One misplaced device may give cybercriminals the necessary access to penetrate the target’s network.\nPotential Impact on ICS Components following Cyber Attacks\nThe impact of cyber attacks on industries using ICS depends on the target’s nature of operation or the motivation of cybercriminals pursuing the attack. Every effect listed below may be felt by a target’s internal, as well as external, clientele.\n- Changes in a system, an operation system, or in application configurations. When systems are tampered with, it may produce unwanted or unpredictable results. This may be done to mask malware behavior or any malicious activity. This may also affect the output of a threat actor’s target.\n- Change in Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), Remote Terminal Units (RTU), and other controllers. Similar to a change in systems, a change in controller modules and other devices can lead to damaged equipment or facilities. This can also cause process malfunction and disabled controls over a process.\n- Misinformation reported to operations. This scenario may lead to the implementation of unwanted or unnecessary actions due to wrong information. Such an event can result in a change in the programmable logics. This can also help hide malicious activity, which includes the incident itself or the injected code.\n- Tampered safety controls. Preventing the proper operation of fail safes, and other safeguards puts the lives of employees, and possibly even external clients, at risk.\nLike it? Add this infographic to your site:\n1.

40	requirements for registering paint horse breeding association	To be eligible for registry, a Paint's sire and dam must be registered with the American Paint Horse Association, the American Quarter Horse Association, or the Jockey Club (Thoroughbreds). For the Regular Registry, the horse must also exhibit a minimum amount of white hair over unpigmented (pink) skin.	"['Descended from horses introduced by the Spanish conquistadors, American Paints became part of the herds of wild horses that roamed the Western deserts and plains.\nOnce domesticated, because of their working ability and heart, cowboys for cattle work cherished the Paint. Native Americans revered the Paint, which they believed to possess magical powers.\nBy the early 1800s, the western plains were generously populated by free-ranging herds of horses, and those herds included the peculiar spotted horse. Because of their color and performance, flashy, spotted horses soon became a favorite mount of the American Indian. The Comanche Indians, considered by many authorities to be the finest horsemen on the Plains, favored loud-colored horses and had many among their immense herds. Evidence of this favoritism is exhibited by drawings of spotted horses found on the painted buffalo robes that served as records for the Comanches.\nThroughout the 1800s and late into the 1900s, these spotted horses were called by a variety of names: pinto, paint, skewbald, piebald. In the late 1950s, a group dedicated to preserving the spotted horse was organized—the Pinto Horse Association. In 1962, another group of spotted horse enthusiasts organized an Association, but this group was dedicated to preserving both color and stock-type conformation—the American Paint Stock Horse Association (APSHA).\nThis group thought the varied, distinct coat patterns of the American Paint were appealing. However, being knowledgeable devotees of Western stock-type horses, they insisted that stock-type conformation had to be the first criteria for establishing a registry.\nThe American Paint Horse’s combination of color and conformation has made the American Paint Horse Association (APHA) the second-largest breed registry in the United States based on the number of horses registered annually. While the colorful coat pattern is essential to the identity of the breed, American Paint Horses have strict bloodline requirements and a distinctive stock-horse body type. To be eligible for registry, a Paint’s sire and dam must be registered with the American Paint Horse Association, the American Quarter Horse Association, or the Jockey Club (Thoroughbreds). To be eligible for the Regular Registry, the horse must also exhibit a minimum amount of white hair over unpigmented (pink) skin.\nWhile over the years the conformation and athletic ability of those rugged mounts of the Old West have been improved by breeders, the unusual coat patterns and coloring remain the same. The stock-type conformation, intelligence, and willing attitude make the American Paint Horse an excellent horse for pleasure riding, ranch work, rodeo, trail riding, racing, showing, or simply as a friendly mount for the kids.\nAmerican Paint Horse Breed Characteristics\nBuilt for versatility, the American Paint Horse is generally short-coupled, strong- boned and well balanced.\nYet Paints display a remarkable degree of refinement and beauty, especially about the head and neck. The Paint Horse’s colorful coat pattern defines the breed, because it is perhaps the most obvious trait. However, Paint Horses must also possess a distinct stock- type conformation. Paints come in an endless variety of patterns. Their coat is always a combination of white with any of the basic colors common to horses: black, bay, brown, chestnut, dun, grulla, sorrel, palomino, gray and roan.\nAmerican Paint Horse Coat Pattern\nRegardless of color, no two horses are exactly alike in coat pattern. For registration and breeding purposes, three distinctive types of coat pattern categorize American Paint Horses. The tobiano (pronounced: tow be yah’ no) pattern is distinguished by head markings like those of a solid-colored horse; their heads may be completely solid, or have a blaze, strip, star or snip. Generally, all four of the tobiano’s legs are white, at least below the hocks and knees. Their spots are regular and distinctly oval or round, extending down the neck and chest, giving the appearance of a shield. Usually a tobiano will have the dark color on one or both flanks – although a tobiano may be either predominantly dark or white. The tail is often two colors.\nThe overo (pronounced: oh vair’ oh) pattern may also be either predominantly dark or white. But typically, the white on an overo will not cross the back of the horse between its withers and its tail. Generally, one or all four legs will be dark. Also notable is that overos have bold white head markings, such as a bald face. Overos generally have irregular, scattered markings. The horse’s tail is usually one color.\nNot all coat patterns fit neatly into the tobiano or overo categories. For this reason, a number of years ago the APHA expanded its classifications to include ""tovero"" (pronounced: tow vair’ oh) to describe horses that have characteristics of both the tobiano and overo patterns. What is especially fascinating about Paint Horse breeding is that the genetics of coat color inheritance is still not readily understood. Like when diving for treasure not every oyster produces a pearl, not every breeding of two Paint Horses results in a colored foal. This makes each Painted foal that much more valuable.\nThe body color ranges from tan through red to reddish-brown. The mane and tail may be black, white or both. Black is also commonly found on the lower legs.\nDescription – bay overo with bald face, right hind sock and left hind pastern.\nA blue roan is a uniform mixture of white with black hairs.\nDescription – blue roan tobiano with blaze and stockings.\nThe buckskin is a type of dun with body color a shade of yellow or gold. The mane and tail may be black, white or both. Black is common on the lower legs. A buckskin may not have a black dorsal stripe.\nDescription – buckskin tobiano with a star, right fore sock and three stockings.\nThe body color is dark red or reddish brown. The mane and tail are usually dark red or reddish brown, but may be flaxen or white.\nDescription – chestnut overo with bald (or blaze) face and stockings.\nThe body color is yellow or gold, with each hair the same color. The mane and tail may be black, brown, red, yellow, white or mixed. Duns may exhibit a dorsal stripe, a transverse stripe over the withers, and zebra stripes on the legs.\nDescription – dun tobiano with irregular star, stripe and stockings.\nGray is a mixture of white and any other color of hair. A gray is born solid- or almost solid-colored and gets lighter with age and as more hair grows.\nDescription – gray overo with bald face and stockings.\nThe body color is smoky or mouse-colored (not a mixture of black and white hairs, but each hair is mouse-colored). The mane and tail may be black, white or both, and there is typically black on the lower legs.\nDescription – grullo overo with blaze, left fore pastern and three stockings.\nThe body color is a shade of yellow or gold. The mane and tail are white, yellow or gold. Palominos do not have dorsal stripes like the similarly colored dun horse.\nDescription – palomino overo with blaze, right fore coronet, right rear sock and left hind stocking.\nRed dun is a form of dun typically with a yellow- or flesh-colored body. The mane, tail and dorsal stripe may be red, white or both.\nDescription – red dun tovero with bald face and four stockings.\nA red roan is more or less a uniform mixture of white with red ahair. The mane and tail may be red, black, flaxen or white.\nDescription – red roan overo with bald face and right fore pastern and hind stockings.\nThe body is a clear reddish or copper-red color. The mane and tail are usually the same color as the body and may be flaxen or white.\nDescription – sorrel overo with bald face, right fore sock and left hind stocking.']"	['<urn:uuid:9ee416dc-6029-47ec-8ee2-5750c01085c9>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	7	48	1292
41	What are the main signs of a blackhead on the skin, and how can it be treated if it appears on my face?	A blackhead, also known as comedo, develops when sebaceous glands become enlarged due to accumulated serum. The black color is caused by melanin and oxidized oil, not dirt. Blackheads commonly occur during adolescence and are usually found on the face, chest, and back. While they are of cosmetic rather than medical importance, they can be removed with an extractor that takes out the plug and improves appearance. However, the blackhead often returns within a month.	"['3-4. TYPES OF SKIN LESIONS\nGeneral Information. Generally, while the epidermis plays a leading role in the skin by being the barrier between the human\'s internal tissues, and so forth, and the environment, the dermis is the more indispensable. Of the two layers, the dermis is much thicker and measures up to four mm in depth. The dermis is composed of collagenous and elastic tissues. These tissues provide the structural base for the epidermis as well as a site for vascular and nerve networks in the skin. Alteration in any component of the skin-- epidermis, dermis, or any skin appendage--can result in clinically visible skin lesions.\nTypes of Skin Lesions. Skin lesions can be divided into three categories: primary skin lesions, secondary skin lesions, and special skin lesions.\nPrimary skin lesions are basic and simple.\nSecondary skin lesions result from complications of primary skin lesions.\nPrimary Skin Lesions.\nMacule. A macule (figure 3-3) is a definite area of skin in which the skin color has changed from the normal skin color. This area is neither higher nor lower than the surrounding skin area. These flat, discolored spots are either hypopigmented (abnormally diminished in pigmentation) or hyperpigmented (abnormally increased in pigmentation). The lesions are of varied size, less than one milliliter in diameter. Macules may be adjacent to each other and cover a whole extremity (for example, a leg) or half of the face (as in the disease capillary hemangioma). Macules may be cafe au lait colored (color of coffee with milk) as in Albright\'s syndrome, blue to black as in urticaria (hives), or white as in certain forms of leprosy.\nFigure 3-3. Macule.\nPapule. A papule (figure 3-4) is a solid, elevated lesion usually 0.5 cm to 1 cm or less in diameter. Most of the lesion is above the level of the surrounding skin rather than deep within the skin. Many skin diseases start with papules--warts, psoriasis, syphilis, drug eruptions, and some phases of acne. Different types of papules are different colors. The papules of psoriasis are flat-topped and red, often with a superimposed scale that produces bleeding when removed. Skin lesions of a secondary syphilis are copper colored. Violet papules are typical of\nlichen planus skin lesions, and the papules of\nlichen sclerosis are whitish. Rounded, red, bluish-red, or brownish-red papules characterize the skin disease\nFigure 3-4. Papule.\nNodule. A nodule (figure 3-5) is a solid, elevated lesion that extends deeper into the dermis than the papule. A nodule is greater than 0.5 cm in diameter but less than 2 cm and may or may not be elevated above the level of the surrounding skin. Examples of nodules include keratinous cysts, small lipomas (benign tumors composed of mature fat cells), fibromas (benign tumors derived from fibrous connective tissue), some types of lymphoma (malignant diseases usually in the lymph nodes), and a variety of neoplasms (abnormal, excessive, and uncontrolled multiplication of cells forming a mass or new growth of tissue). Nodules are often an indication of systemic disease and can result from inflammation, neoplasms, or metabolic deposit in the dermis or subcutaneous tissue. For example, nodules are present in late syphilis, tuberculosis, and roundworm infestation. Sometimes local agents can produce nodules--foreign-body reactions, milker\'s virus, or tick bites.\nFigure 3-5. Nodule.\nTumor. A tumor is an elevated, solid lesion greater than 2 cm. Tumor, a general term for any mass, benign or malignant, is sometimes used to indicate a large nodule. The skin is an extremely common site for a wide variety of tumors; most are easily visible in the earliest stages. Therefore, it is possible to recognize and eradicate tumors in almost 100 percent of the cases. The following are a few of the origins of skin tumors: tumors arising from the epidermis surface; tumors arising from epidermal appendages such as hair structures, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands. Examples of common skin tumors are actinic keratoses, usually caused by repeated exposure to sunlight over the years. These tumors are frequently noted in\nmiddle-age sailors, sportsmen, and farmers. Actinic keratoses are more common in the Southwestern US than in areas with less sunlight. Fair-skinned people are more susceptible to these tumors than those with dark skin. People who are bald frequently develop multiple actinic keratoses.\nWheal. A wheal (figure 3-6) is an elevated lesion (rounded or flat-topped). A wheal has increased tissue fluid, often itches, and usually disappears within a few hours. Trace the wheal with a skin marking pencil, observing over a period of time. You will see the lesions shift rapidly from involved to uninvolved adjacent skin areas. The lesions are the result of excess fluid in the upper layer of the dermis. Wheals are pale red and may be an allergic response to any one of a number of irritants or to insect bites. Twenty-five percent of the normal population can produce wheals merely by stroking their skin. This phenomenon is called\ndermatographism. The size of wheals varies from 3 to 4 mm in diameter as in the skin disease cholinergic urticaria or 10 to 12 mm as in the skin diseases composed of erythematous plaques.\nFigure 3-6. Wheal.\nPlaque. A plaque (figure 3-7) is a rather large surface area which is elevated above the surrounding skin surface. In the skin disease psoriasis, a number of papules form the plaque. In the skin disease lichenification, the skin on the plaque appears thickened, and the skin markings are more visible than usual. Also, the surface of the skin lesions may resemble tree bark. Lichenification is caused by repeatedly rubbing a skin area.\nFigure 3-7. Plaque.\nVesicle and bulla. A vesicle (figure 3-8) is an elevated, fluid-filled skin lesion that is less than 0.5 cm in diameter. A bulla is the same as a vesicle with the exception that the bulla is greater than 0.5 cm in diameter. A vesicle or bulla arises from a cleavage at various levels of the skin. When the cleavage is just beneath the stratum corneum of the skin, a subcorneal vesicle or bulla results as in\ncorneal pustular dermatosis. Sometimes the vesicle or bulla walls are so thin that you can see through them. In such instances, the serum, lymph, blood, or extracellular fluid is quite visible.\nFigure 3-8. Types of vesicles.\nPustule. A pustule (figure 3-9) is a pus-filled lesion that can result from infection of vesicles or bullae. The pus is a thick fluid composed primarily of dead white blood cells (leukocytes) and a thin liquid and often the microbiologic agent responsible for the inflammation. The pustule may appear white, yellow, or greenish-yellow, depending on the color of the material being deposited in the tissue. An example of a common pustule is a follicular or hair pustule. Hair pustules are usually shaped like a cone, have a hair in the center, and heal without scarring.\nFigure 3-9. Pustule.\nSecondary Skin Lesions. Secondary lesions are the result of some primary lesion. A number of conditions such as crust and scale are characteristic of secondary lesions.\nCrust. The dried residue of fluid, blood, or pus on an area of lost or damaged skin surface is crust (figure 3-10). Crusts may be thin, delicate, and easily torn or damaged or the crust may be thick and sticking to the skin. Crusts formed from dried serum (the clear fluid of blood) are yellow while crust formed from pus are yellow-green, and crusts formed from blood are dark red or brown. When dealing with crust, it is most important to determine what is underneath the crust--dermatitis, superficial infection, or ulcer.\nFigure 3-10. Crust.\nScales. Scales are a buildup of dry cells (horny layer) that is higher than usual. Although there are a large variety of scales, some are so distinctive that they can be used to diagnose specific skin problems. For example, a chronic plaque-like scale that is silvery-white to gray is usually psoriasis. Greasy, yellowish scales may indicate seborrheic dermatitis. If the scales are dry and diffuse and look like fish scales on the lower legs, the skin disease is icthyosis. Skin lesions of pityriasis rosea and tinea corpis scale mainly at the edge of individual lesions.\nFissure. A fissure is a crack in the epidermis extending into the dermis. They are linear cleavages in the skin, sometimes very painful. These cracks occur particularly in the hands and feet, especially after therapy has caused excessive drying of the skin. Fissures also occur at the angles of the mouth.\nErosion. A loss of epidermis that does not extend into the dermis is termed erosion. Erosion is often seen in herpes infections.\nUlcer. An ulcer (figure 3-11) is a skin lesion in which there has been destruction of the epidermis and the upper papillary dermis. An ulcer always results in a scar. To determine the cause of an ulcer, note the ulcer\'s location, borders, base, discharge, and any associated features of the lesion such as nodules, excoriations (scratch marks), varicosities (abnormal swellings), hair distribution, presence or absence of sweating, and adjacent pulses. There are many causes of ulcers--skin trauma of all kinds (heat, cold, electrical, chemical); bacterial, viral, and fungal infections; parasitic infestations; and tumors to name just a few.\nFigure 3-11. Ulcer.\nScar. A scar (figure 3-12) is a fibrous healing of a wound, healing that replaces the normal dermis and epidermis that have been damaged. Scars in different areas of the body may look different. Hypertrophic scars (scars with excessive fibers) result when a lot of collagen is produced in the healing process. This type of scar may occur in the course of acne, herpes zoster, and porphyria (a disorder of blood pigment metabolism). In atrophic scars, the epidermis is thin and usually has neither skin lines nor appendages. This type of scar may be depressed.\nFigure 3-12. Scar.\nKeloid. A keloid appears in an area of injury or just arises spontaneously; it is a smooth overgrowth of fibroblastic tissue (tissues composed of spindle-shaped cells). A typical keloid is first noticeable as a small, fairly firm nodule and slowly becomes a marked, several-lobe mass of a dark brown color. The keloid has spontaneous burning, itching, and tingling. Keloids are more frequent in blacks.\nAtrophy. Skin atrophy (figure 3-13) is a thinning and wrinkling of the epidermis often seen in the aged. Another type of skin atrophy is the stretch marks seen in the skin of women who have been pregnant or in the skin of people who have had a large weight loss. Glistening white bands in the skin are typical of these stretch marks, the bands having been caused by overstretching and weakening of the elastic tissue of the skin.\nFigure 3-13. Atrophy.\nSpecial Skin Lesions.\nComedo (blackhead). A comedo or blackhead develops when sebaceous glands become enlarged because of accumulated serum. Blackheads more commonly happen during adolescence and are usually found over the face, chest, and back. The color of blackheads is caused by melanin and oxidized oil, not dirt. A blackhead is of cosmetic rather than medical importance. The contents of the lesion may be removed with an extractor that takes out the plug and improves cosmetic appearance. Often, however, the blackhead returns in full flower within a month.\nMilia (whitehead). A milia or whitehead occurs when a sebaceous duct is blocked with horny materials. These skin lesions, of cosmetic importance only, are small, superficial, keratinous cysts. To remove these cysts, make a small opening with a scalpel and remove the cyst with a comedo extractor.\nSebaceous cyst. A sebaceous cyst forms as a result of a blocked sebaceous duct which continues its activity. In puberty, the growth-pattern of sebaceous glands changes often cause an increase in sebaceous cysts.\nWen. A wen is a common type of epidermal cyst, a sebaceous cyst, found on the scalp or scrotum. This type of sebaceous cyst is a slow-growing cyst containing follicular, keratinous, and sebaceous material. When palpated, the cystic mass is firm, globular, moveable, and nontender. It seldom causes discomfort unless it is infected. When punctured, the contents of the cyst are found to be cheesy, often fetid formed of epithelial debris and greasy material with soft keratin present. Sometimes, calcium deposits may be found. If the wen is small, the contents may be expressed by making a tiny stab incision. If the wen is large, a small incision can be made and the contents evacuated. Then, remove the cyst wall with a curette or hemostat. The wall of a large cyst must be removed to prevent recurrence of the cyst.\n(ingrown hair). Usually caused by\naureus, folliculitis is a superficial or deep bacterial infection and irritation of the hair follicle. The lesion is made up of a superficial pustule or inflammatory nodule surrounding a hair. Infected hairs can be easily removed. When the hair follicles are deep in the skin (for example, the bearded region), folliculitis may become chronic. Stiff hairs in the bearded area of the skin may come out of the hair follicle, curve, and reenter the skin. This produces a chronic, low-grade irritation without major infection. To prevent folliculitis, aggravating factors or irritations must be corrected.\nFuruncle (boil). A furuncle is a deep-seated infection with a single core; the infection involves the entire hair follicle and adjacent subcutaneous tissue. This lesion becomes a pustule 5 to 30 mm in diameter with central necrosis that discharges a core and liquid. Furuncles usually occur in hairy parts of the body where there is irritation, friction, pressure, moisture, or oily skin. Although furuncles occur frequently on the neck, breasts, face, or buttocks, these skin lesions are most painful when they occur in skin that is closely attached to underlying structures; for example, the nose, ear, or fingers. Furuncles can occur over and over, often in healthy young people.\nCarbuncle. A carbuncle is a staph infection with multiple tracts (several furuncles) that extend into the subcutaneous tissue. The furuncles have developed in adjoining hair follicles, developing more slowly than one furuncle and sometimes accompanied by fever and prostration. The infection causes pus to be produced and drain from the furuncles. Carbuncles develop most frequently in males occurring commonly on the nape of the neck.\nAbscess. An abscess is a localized collection of pus, usually caused by bacterial infection, in tissues, organs, or confined spaces. Abscesses in cutaneous or subcutaneous skin layers are evident by swelling, tenderness, and redness over the affected site. The patient may experience fever if the infection is spreading. Usually, the contents of an abscess must be removed for healing to take place. The abscess sometimes ruptures spontaneously into adjacent tissue or outside the body.\nTelangiectasia. This skin lesion is a small cluster of dilated blood vessels. Fine, bright red lines or net-like patterns may be seen on the skin. Usually not elevated, these skin lesions can be found around the nail bed, on the face and trunk. Telangiectases are common on the face of people who are in the sun and wind a great deal.\nPetechiae. A petechia is a small hemorrhage under the skin. This lesion appears as a nonraised, purplish-red spot on the skin, nailbeds, or mucous membranes.\nEcchymosis. This is a ruptured vein commonly called a bruise. It is a black and blue spot on the skin caused by the escape of blood from injured blood vessels.\nMaceration. Maceration is a softening of solid tissue by soaking. The tissue turns white and breaks down easily.\nBurrow. A burrow is a tunnel or linear train in the epidermal layer of the skin caused by a parasite. The contagious, parasitic skin disease scabies is a good example of a parasite burrowing. The skin damage is caused by the female\nSarcoptes scabiei who excavates a burrow in the stratum corneum layer of the epidermis, lays her eggs and dies. The larvae emerge, moult, and the females are fertilized. The most common sites in which the parasite enters the skin are between the fingers, the hands, and the wrists.

42	milk allergy can i eat skyr instead activia	If you have a milk allergy, neither Activia nor Skyr would be suitable options as they are both dairy products. Activia specifically lists milk allergy as a counter-indication. Skyr, while being an Icelandic style yogurt that is higher in protein and lower in sugar (6 grams per 8-ounce serving), is still made with milk - in fact, it uses more milk than regular yogurt in its production process. People with milk allergies should avoid both products.	"['Is Activia suitable for children?\nIt is suitable for the whole family, including children who are looking to eat a healthy, balanced diet.\nWhat is Bifidobacterium (animalis) lactis?\nBifidobacterium (animalis) lactis is a gram-positive anaerobic bacteria belonging to the same category as lactic bacteria, as it produces lactic acid during the fermentation process. This bacterium is part of the bifidobacteria family.\nIn summary, Bifidobacterium (animalis) lactis is a exclusive strain of bifidobacteria known in Canada under the name BL Regularis, and was specially selected by Danone Vitapole (Daniel Carasso Research Centre). BL Regularis is an active, living culture used only by Danone. BL Regularis contributes to the proper functioning of the digestive system*.\n* When consumed as part of a balanced diet and healthy life style.\nIs there a risk in eating too much Activia? Are there any counter-indications?\nWe have no specific information on over-consumption of Activia because fermented milks are regular consumption food. However, throughout our clinical studies, certain subjects had to ingest three portions per day for 15 days, and we noted no particular complaints - even from elderly people who were not used to ingesting such quantities of yogurt.\nAll over-consumption can alter the dietary routine, so it is important to ingest foods from all necessary groups every day.\nCounter-indication: Allergies to milk.\nIs it possible to consume Activia after its expiration date?\nLike all fermented milk products, it must ideally be consumed before the expiry date. However, if it is only slightly past the expiry date, there is no danger. The product will simply contain fewer living bacteria and the taste could be slightly more acidic.\nWhat is the source of gelatin in Activia?\nThe gelatine in Activia is from a bovine source.\nWhy are there trans fats in Activia?\nTrans fatty acids (TFA) found in food have two principal origins: industrial or animal. Animal-based TFA originate from the bacterial transformation of unsaturated fatty acids in the rumen (stomach) of ruminants. Industrial-based TFA are linked to the partial hydrogenation of oils and edible fats, as well as the deodorization of oils. Milk and milk products contain small quantities (5%) of TFA naturally. TFA can also be found in products that originate from ruminants (cows, sheep, goats, etc.), but only in small quantities.\nWhat is the nature of the change of strain code for Activia going from DN-173 010 to CNCM I-2494?\nCNCM I-2494 is the new appellation for Activia’s probiotic culture, due to its deposition in the ""Collection Nationale de Cultures de Micro-Organismes"" at the Institue Pasteur in Paris, France. Nothing changes in the nature of the culture or the benefits related to it. Only the name of the code has changed.\nWhat does “no artificial sweeteners” mean?\nAmong the artificial sweeteners in use, we have sucralose, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, neotame, alitame, cyclamate and saccharin. “Sweetening” a food means making it milder by adding sugar or another substance with the ability to sweeten. A sweetener is said to be “artificial” if it’s produced in a laboratory from different chemical compounds. Artificial sweeteners are also known for their very high sweetening power.* However, doubts still linger concerning their effects on health. This is why Danone is proud to offer its new Activia Fat Free, a yogurt with no artificial sweeteners because we’ve removed the sucralose and replaced it with two natural sweeteners: stevia extract and cane sugar.', 'Yogurt: What’s Healthy & What’s Not\nYogurt often tops the list as a natural food that packs a lot of nutritional value. When produced in its simplest form, which is fermenting good bacteria with milk, yogurt is a great source of protein, B vitamins, calcium, and probiotics (mostly Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, which are both required to make a true yogurt product). The catch: yogurt’s really only good for you when the ingredients are natural, pure, and kept simple. Unfortunately, many of the conventional yogurts fall into the unhealthy category because they contain unnecessary ingredients.\nWhy Is Conventional Yogurt So Unhealthy?\nMany yogurts contain high amounts of added sugar, especially the flavored varieties with granola clusters and the ones with fruit on the bottom. A 6-ounce serving of regular flavored yogurt may contain as much as 35 grams of sugar. That’s more than the recommended daily intake of sugar, which should be less than 30 grams of sugar a day. Consider, too, the drinks and processed foods that are often consumed: juice, soda, dessert, and other foods that are deceptively “healthy” because they too contain a lot of added sugar. At the end of the day, most Americans consume on average 17 teaspoons of sugar or roughly 71 grams of sugar!\nIt’s important to note that lactose, the naturally occurring milk sugar in yogurt, makes up part of the total sugar content (total sugar includes both natural and added sugar). Most 8-ounce regular yogurts have about 12–15 grams of lactose (natural sugar). An 8-ounce serving of Greek yogurt has less natural sugar (roughly 9 grams) because liquid is strained during production, resulting in some sugar removal, thicker yogurt, and more protein. Skyr, an Icelandic yogurt, is produced with a similar straining process. It’s made with more milk than regular yogurt, has a high protein content, and is low in natural sugar (6 grams per 8-ounce serving).\nOn top of the high-fructose syrups that are often added, many conventional yogurts also contain artificial colors and sweeteners, preservatives, thickening agents, and milk protein concentrate to increase protein. Some yogurts may be heat-treated after culturing to extend their shelf life, but this process kills off any bacteria and diminishes the point of eating a healthful food filled with live and active cultures. Other yogurts may not even use real fruit at all.\nWhat’s In Healthy Yogurt?\nThe best yogurt for you is the one that has the least amount of ingredients but also the most natural ingredients. Ideally, the healthiest yogurts contain whole milk and live active cultures (L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus) and do not list sugar in the top ingredients. Look for yogurt made with USDA-certified organic whole milk that comes from 100% grass-fed or pasture-raised cows. Remember, whole milk has more of the healthy beneficial saturated fat that we need versus skim and low-fat milk. (See our WFP YouTube experience at Stryk Jersey Farm to learn more about the health benefits of grass-fed Raw Milk.) Many healthy yogurts also provide the Live and Active Cultures seal to indicate the yogurt contains a high amount of yogurt cultures (e.g., 100 million cultures per gram at the time of production); however, there are also healthy organic options that contain very high amounts of live and active cultures but do not provide the seal. (The seal isn’t mandatory and is provided voluntarily by a company.)\nWFP’s Take-Home Advice\n- Use the Cornucopia Institute’s yogurt scorecard as a guide when buying healthy yogurts: https://www.cornucopia.org/yogurt-scorecard/. The scorecard includes comprehensive information about yogurt ingredients and rates yogurts so that you know which ones are the healthiest vs. unhealthiest. Many of their top yogurts are found at both natural and conventional grocery stores. WFP recommends:\n- Maple Hill Creamery Plain Greek 100% Grass-Fed Organic Whole Milk Yogurt (Whole Foods and other natural health food stores)\n- Stonyfield Plain 100% Grass-Fed Organic Whole Milk Yogurt (Whole Foods and other natural health food stores)\n- Organic Valley Plain Grassmilk 100% Grass-Fed, No Grain Whole Milk Yogurt (Whole Foods and other natural health food stores)\n- Straus Family Creamery Non-GMO Certified Plain Greek Organic Whole Milk Yogurt (Sprouts and other natural health food stores)\n- Stonyfield Organic Plain Greek Pasture-Raised Whole Milk Yogurt (HEB and other natural health food stores)\n- White Mountain Organic Whole Milk Bulgarian Yogurt (HEB, Randalls, Sprouts, Whole Foods)\n- Green Valley Organics Certified-Humane Plain *Lactose-Free Yogurt (HEB and other natural health food stores) *For lactose-intolerant consumers\n- Choose yogurts made with organic whole milk and that say, “100% grass-fed or pasture-raised” so that you know the dairy cows are living their lives on grass pastures, not in factory-farm conditions. Grass-fed cows typically eat native grasses and are not fed GMO grains.\n- We also recommend choosing plain, unflavored yogurt rather than those that are flavored or have added fruit. Plain yogurts typically do not have added sugar. Add your own toppings of fresh fruit and natural added sugar, such as ½–1 teaspoon of honey or maple syrup. Plain yogurt is also a great substitute for sour cream.\n- Avoid store-bought yogurt parfaits; they pack a lot of additional ingredients on top of flavored yogurt, which ultimately drives up the added sugar content.\n- Companies must disclose whether they heat-treat their yogurt after the probiotics have been added. Look for labels that state, “heat-treated after culturing,” and avoid these products as the process kills off the beneficial live cultures. Choose the ones that say, “contains active yogurt cultures” or “live active cultures/acidophilus.” Probiotics are good for your digestive system and also help maintain a healthy immune system. Yogurt is a great way to incorporate beneficial bacteria into your diet as is taking a daily probiotic. Our WFP Probiotic Complete is a comprehensive multi-strain formula that includes Saccharomyces boulardii (SB), Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium.\nFollow these guidelines and remember to always read the nutrition labels carefully to help you choose the healthiest yogurt for you and your family!\nEditor’s Note: This article was originally published on May 8, 2017 and has since been updated.\nSources and References:\nCornucopia Institute: Cornucopia Yogurt Buyer’s Guide.

43	growing white eggplants in my garden want know exact harvest time for optimal flavor texture	White eggplants are ready to harvest when they reach 6-8 inches in length and have firm, glossy skin, typically 65-80 days after planting. For optimal flavor and texture, look for eggplants with uniform creamy white color and skin that bounces back when pressed gently. It's important not to wait too long to harvest, as overripe eggplants can become bitter and tough. The best time to pick them is when they're still young and tender, around 2-3 months after planting.	['To know when to harvest white eggplant, look for firm, glossy skins 6-8 inches long. Gathering time usually occurs 65-80 days after planting.\nWhite eggplants are best harvested when the skin is shiny, and the flesh is tender. Waiting too long can result in more challenging and bitter-tasting fruit. Aim to harvest your white eggplants at their peak freshness and size, typically around 2-3 months after planting.\nMonitoring their appearance and touch is crucial for determining the optimal harvest time for eggplants. Growing these eggplants, as suggested by https://hatchettgardendesign.com/, provides a delightful addition to any garden and can be enjoyed in various culinary dishes. Understanding when to harvest them ensures you get the best taste and texture, making them a valuable asset to your home garden and kitchen repertoire.\nWhy White Eggplant?\nWhite eggplants are a unique variety of traditional eggplant, known for their mild flavor, tender texture, and smooth, white skin. These white eggplants are popular for those looking to add variety to their vegetable garden. Home cooks and chefs often seek them out for their distinct taste and versatility in the kitchen, making them a sought-after ingredient for a wide range of dishes. Their unique characteristics distinguish them from their purple counterparts, offering a novel experience for both the gardener and the culinary enthusiast.\nVarieties Of White Eggplant\nWhite eggplants come in various shapes and sizes, with some of the popular varieties being:\n- White Beauty: A classic white eggplant variety with smooth and glossy skin.\n- Casper: A small, round eggplant with creamy white skin, perfect for grilling or roasting.\n- Cloud Nine: A larger-sized eggplant with a pear-shaped, creamy white fruit.\nNutritional Benefits Of White Eggplant\nWhite eggplants are a culinary delight and offer several nutritional benefits. They are low in calories, high in fibre, and rich in essential nutrients such as:\n- Vitamin C: Supports immune function and skin health.\n- Potassium: Regulates blood pressure and supports heart health.\n- Folate: Essential for DNA synthesis and cell growth.\n- Antioxidants: Protect cells from damage and reduce inflammation.\nWhen To Harvest White Eggplant\nSigns Of Maturity\nWhite eggplants are ready to be harvested when they reach 6 to 8 inches and have firm, glossy skin. The colour should be uniform and creamy white. The ideal size for picking is when the eggplant is still young and tender, as it can become bitter if left to grow too large. Inspect your eggplants regularly for these characteristics to determine the best time for harvest.\nHarvest white eggplants promptly once they reach the appropriate size and colour to prevent overripeness. Avoid letting them stay on the plant for too long, as this can result in a tough texture and bitter flavour. Cut the eggplants from the plant using a sharp knife or shears with a small portion of the stem attached. This method ensures a clean cut that promotes healing and reduces the risk of rot. Handle the harvested eggplants with care to preserve their quality and flavour.\nTips For Optimal Picking\nWhen it comes to harvesting white eggplants, timing is crucial. Picking your eggplants at the right moment ensures that they are at their maximum flavour and texture. Here are some essential tips to remember to help you determine the perfect time to harvest your white eggplants.\nChecking The Size\nThe size is one of the first things to consider when harvesting white eggplants. Eggplants should reach a specific size before they are picked to ensure they are fully mature. A mature white eggplant is typically 6 to 8 inches long and 2 to 3 inches in diameter. Here’s a handy table summarizing the optimal size for harvesting:\n|6 to 7 inches long, 2 to 2.5 inches in diameter\n|Early harvest, suitable for dishes requiring firm flesh\n|7 to 8 inches long, 2.5 to 3 inches in diameter\n|Mid-stage harvest, ideal for a balance of flavour and texture\n|8 inches or longer, 3 inches or wider\n|Full maturity, perfect for dishes that benefit from a more tender texture\nObserving The Color\nThe colour of a white eggplant is a good indicator of its ripeness. When an eggplant is ready to be harvested, it will have a glossy, creamy white skin. A slight yellowing of the skin can also indicate ripeness. Avoid picking eggplants that have a dull, greenish hue, as they are likely unripe and may lack flavor.\nEvaluating Texture And Firmness\nTexture and firmness are crucial factors when determining the readiness of a white eggplant for harvest. Gently press the skin of the eggplant with your thumb. A ripe eggplant should have a slight give, indicating that it is firm but not too hard. Avoid overly soft or mushy eggplants, as this can be a sign of over-ripeness. Additionally, the skin of a ripe eggplant should be smooth and free from blemishes.\nBy following these tips, you can harvest white eggplants at the perfect stage of ripeness, ensuring optimal flavour and texture in your culinary creations.\nHarvesting white eggplants at the right time ensures optimal flavour and texture. Using proper harvesting techniques can help in preserving the quality of the fruit. In this section, we will discuss two essential techniques: using pruning shears and proper stem removal.\nUsing Pruning Shears\nWhen it comes to harvesting white eggplants, using pruning shears is a handy tool. Pruning shears are perfect for cleanly cutting through the stems without damaging the fragile fruit. Here are a few steps to follow when using pruning shears:\n- Inspect the eggplant plant for mature fruits with a bright white colour, smooth skin, and a firm texture.\n- Identify the stem that connects the white eggplant to the plant.\n- Using sharp pruning shears, position the blades around 1 inch above the stem and make a clean, precise cut.\n- Hold the eggplant with one hand while cutting to avoid dropping or damaging the fruit.\n- Place the harvested white eggplants into a basket or container, ensuring they are not stacked to prevent bruising.\nUsing pruning shears, you can harvest your white eggplants effectively without harming or stressing the plant.\nProper Stem Removal\nProper stem removal is another crucial technique to master when harvesting white eggplants. By removing the stem correctly, you can prevent the fruit from spoiling. Follow these steps for proper stem removal:\n- Gently hold the white eggplant near the base to stabilize it.\n- Using your sharp knife, cut around the stem in a circle, ensuring the cut is shallow to avoid damaging the fruit.\n- Remove the stem by gently twisting it until it detaches from the eggplant.\n- Inspect the cut area to ensure that no part of the stem remains attached to avoid potential rot.\nProper stem removal helps maintain the freshness and quality of the harvested white eggplant.\nStoring And Using Harvested White Eggplant\nHarvest white eggplants when the skin turns glossy and firm, typically about 70 days from planting. Store harvested white eggplants in a cool and dry place and use them within a week for optimal flavour and texture.\nStoring Fresh White Eggplant\nIf you’ve successfully harvested your white eggplant, it’s essential to know how to store it properly to maintain its freshness and flavour. Here are some tips to help you keep your fresh white eggplant:\n- After picking your white eggplant, gently wipe off any dirt or debris using a soft cloth or paper towel.\n- Do not wash the eggplant, which can lead to moisture build-up and spoilage.\n- Inspect the eggplant for signs of damage or decay. Use only firm eggplants with smooth and shiny skin.\n- If you’re not planning to use the white eggplant immediately, store it in your refrigerator’s vegetable crisper. Wrap it loosely in a plastic bag or place it in a perforated plastic bag to allow airflow.\n- For optimum storage conditions, ensure that your refrigerator’s temperature is set between 45 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit (7 and 10 degrees Celsius).\n- Check on the stored eggplant regularly to remove any that may have developed soft spots or mould. This will help prevent spoilage and keep the remaining eggplants fresh.\nPreparation And Cooking Methods\nNow that you’ve correctly stored your white eggplant, you may wonder how to make the most of your harvest. Here are some preparation and cooking methods to help you unleash the delicious potential of white eggplant:\n- Slice and grill: Cut the white eggplant into round slices, brush them with olive oil, and sprinkle with your favourite seasonings. Grill them until they are tender and slightly charred. The smoky flavour adds depth to the eggplant’s taste.\n- Cut into cubes for stir-frying: Dice the eggplant into bite-sized cubes and toss them into a hot skillet or wok with your preferred stir-fry ingredients. The eggplant absorbs flavours well and adds a delightful texture to your dishes.\n- Stuff and bake: Hollow out the white eggplant and fill it with a mixture of breadcrumbs, herbs, cheese, or other fillings. Bake them in the oven until the eggplant is tender, and the filling is golden brown and delicious.\n- Roast for a Mediterranean-inspired dish: Cut the eggplant lengthwise into thick slices, drizzle them with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and herbs like oregano or thyme. Roast them in the oven until they are caramelized and tender. Serve with a side of tzatziki or hummus.\n- Blend into creamy dips: Peel and dice the white eggplant, then steam or sauté until it becomes soft. Once cooled, blend it with tahini, garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil to make a flavorful dip or spread for sandwiches or as a topping for roasted vegetables.\nExperiment with these preparation and cooking methods to discover your favourite ways of savouring white eggplant’s unique flavour and versatility. Remember to adjust the seasoning and cooking time according to your taste preferences, and enjoy the culinary adventure of using your freshly harvested white eggplant!\nFrequently Asked Questions Of White Eggplant: When To Harvest\nWhat Is The Best Time To Harvest White Eggplant?\nThe best time to harvest white eggplant is when they reach their mature size, usually around 4 to 6 inches long. Check for smooth, shiny skin, a firm texture, and bright white colour. Avoid waiting too long, as overripe white eggplants can become bitter.\nHow Do I Know If White Eggplant Is Ready To Be Harvested?\nTo know if white eggplant is ready to be harvested, gently press your finger on the skin. If it leaves an indentation, the eggplant is not yet ripe. However, if the skin bounces back, it’s a sign that the eggplant is mature and ready to be harvested.\nAlso, check for a vibrant white colour and firm texture.\nCan White Eggplants Be Eaten When They Are Still Green?\nYes, white eggplants can be eaten when they are still green. They are perfectly edible at this stage and have a slightly firmer texture. However, if you prefer a milder flavour and a softer texture, it’s best to wait until the eggplant turns white before harvesting and consuming it.\nTiming is crucial to ensuring a successful harvest of white eggplants. To discover invaluable gardening tips and learn the art of timing your harvest perfectly, delve into resources dedicated to gardening wisdom. By closely monitoring their development, you can determine the perfect moment to pluck them from the plant. Harvesting them too early may lead to under-ripened fruits, while waiting too long can result in over-matured ones.\nRemember to check the eggplants’ color and firmness to make an informed decision. Enjoy your garden’s bounty by mastering the art of harvesting white eggplants at just the right time.

44	I'm trying to eat healthy - what's the deal with fiber claims on food labels?	While many products claim to be 'a good source of fiber,' this can be misleading. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, many manufacturers add 'isolated fibers' like chicory root or purified powders rather than traditional fiber sources like whole grains, beans, vegetables or fruits. Studies show you should aim for 25-38g of fiber daily from natural sources, as fiber-rich whole foods provide additional health compounds like polyphenols and carotenoids. The best approach is to get fiber from a variety of sources - cellulose from nuts and brown rice, lignin from flax, pectin from berries, and resistant starch from foods like oatmeal and legumes.	"['Hi OLers read the following article to gain some great insight into the mischevious advertising ways of food labels. Thanks to the New York Times for this great article below. Happy Eating\nAlthough food labels are supposed to tell us exactly what\'s in the food we\'re buying, marketers have created a language all their own to make foods sound more healthful than they really are.\nToday\'s ""Consumer Ally"" column on AOL\'s WalletPop site explores misleading food-label lingo, noting that some commonly used phrases have ""almost no meaning.""\nEmpty claims like ""Made with Natural Goodness,"" ""Kid Approved"" and ""Doctor Recommended"" have become as common as those with legal definitions. Today, even regulated terms like ""Healthy"" and ""Contains Antioxidants"" have become muddied.\nConsumer Ally columnist Mitch Lipka points to the 158-page ""Food Labeling Chaos"" report from the Center for Science in the Public Interest that identifies several misleading labeling tactics used by food companies. Here are six common but misleading claims included in the C.S.P.I. report.\nLightly-sweetened: Cereal packages often contain the phrase ""lightly sweetened"" to suggest less sugar. The Food and Drug Administration has regulations concerning the use of ""sugar free"" and ""no added sugars"" but nothing governing the claims ""low sugar"" or ""lightly sweetened."" ""Whether Kellogg\'s Frosted Mini-Wheats Bite Size is lightly sweetened should be determined by federal rules, not the marketing executives of a manufacturer,"" says the C.S.P.I. report.\nA good source of fiber: A number of food marketers now claim their products are a good source of fiber, but C.S.P.I. notes that often the fiber doesn\'t come from traditional sources — whole grains, bean, vegetables or fruit — known to have health benefits. Instead, food makers are adding something called ""isolated fibers"" made from chicory root or purified powders of polydextrose and other substances that haven\'t been shown to lower blood sugar or cholesterol.\nStrengthens your immune system: Through ""clever wordsmithing,"" food companies can skirt F.D.A. rules about health claims and give consumers the impression that a product will ward off disease, notes the C.S.P.I. report. Ocean Spray Cranberry Juice claims to ""strengthen your immune system with a daily dose of vitamin C."" Green Giant offers an ""immunity blend"" of frozen vegetables. Nestle\'s Carnation Instant Breakfast says it contains ""Antioxidants to help support the immune system.""\nMade with real fruit: Often the ""real fruit"" is found in small quantities and isn\'t even the same kind of fruit pictured on the package. Tropical fruit flavored Gerber Graduates Fruit Juice Treats show pictures of fresh oranges and pineapple. But the main ingredients are corn syrup, sugar and white grape juice concentrate. Betty Crocker\'s Strawberry Splash Fruit Gushers don\'t contain strawberries — just pear concentrate.\nMade with whole grains: Many products make a whole grain claim even though they often contain refined flour as the first ingredient and the amount of whole grains are minimal. The C.S.P.I. reports that the package of Keebler\'s Townhouse Bistro Multigrain Crackers boasts they are made with ""toasted whole wheat,"" but the ingredient label shows the crackers contain more sugar than whole wheat.\nAll natural. Although the F.D.A. has issued several warning letters to firms making misleading ""all natural"" claims, the agency has never issued formal rules about the term, C.S.P.I. says. As a result, some products containing high fructose corn syrup claim to be ""all natural."" One example is Minute Maid Premium All Natural Flavors Berry Punch. ""Though glucose and fructose certainly occur in nature, the chemical conversions of cornstarch should not be considered natural,"" writes C.S.P.I.\nYou can read more about label confusion on the WalletPop blog, or click here for a detailed summary of the C.S.P.I. report as well as a link to the full 158 page document.\nWant to master Microsoft Excel and take your work-from-home job prospects to the next level?

And you would be right, at least partially. However, dietary fiber does a lot more than just benefit your intestines. A fiber-rich diet may also confer lower risk of hypertension and diabetes. Unfortunately, we don’t get enough fiber — the average intake is only about 15 grams (g) per day, far below the recommended daily intake of 25 g for women and 38 g for men.\n“Two common misconceptions are that it is tough to meet the daily fiber recommendations and that food high in fiber tastes bad,” says Vandana Sheth, R.D.N., C.D.E., spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\nOur five fabulous fiber facts will have you reaching for more delicious, high-fiber foods to help you meet that goal 25 to 38 gram goal.\n1. High-fiber foods are rich in disease-preventing compounds. Fiber-rich plant foods, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, are also packed with a host of naturally occurring compounds, such as polyphenols and carotenoids, all of which have been linked to better health.\nTake Home Tip: Choose vegetarian menu options when you can. Add more vegetables to your casseroles, pizzas, and sandwiches.\n2. Fiber may help lower high blood pressure. Studies show that increasing dietary fiber can lower high blood pressure, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. But you’ll need to give it time to work its magic. According to an analysis of several studies, it may take eight weeks to get maximum results.\nTake Home Tip: Switch to whole grain cereals, breads, buns, crackers, pasta and rice.\n3. Fiber can greatly reduce the risk of developing diabetes. Those were the findings from the largest investigation in the world of new-onset type 2 diabetes. How much does it take to reduce your risk? This study found that you need to get more than 26 g of fiber a day to reduce your risk by 18 percent.\nTake Home Tip: Get your day off to a high-fiber start. Choose fiber-rich cereals and add nuts and dried fruit for an additional fiber boost.\n4. Fiber supplements don’t provide the same benefits as high-fiber foods. It goes back to No. 1. High-fiber, whole plant foods provide a lot more than just fiber. And it may be that all of these naturally occurring compounds act in concert to provide maximum health benefits. Removing and isolating the fiber from plants to create a fiber additive for foods (i.e., polydextrose, inulin, maltodextrin) takes away the all-important mix of natural compounds in whole foods.\nTake Home Tip: Snack on almonds, walnuts, pistachios, seeds and dried figs. They taste so much better than fiber supplements.\n5. Mix and match the many types of fiber in foods to provide the most health benefits. Cellulose, found in nuts, whole wheat, seeds and brown rice is a natural laxative. Lignin, found in flax and rye, benefits heart health. Pectin and gums, found in berries and seeds, help lower blood cholesterol. Inulin, found in onions, beets, artichokes, and chicory root may improve the good bacteria in the intestinal tract and enhance your immune system. Resistant starch, found in unripened bananas, oatmeal and legumes (as well as potatoes and rice that have been cooked, then refrigerated), may help control blood sugar.\nTake Home Tip: Bran for breakfast is great, but try to introduce a variety of fiber-rich foods — whole grains, vegetables, fruits and legumes — for the best benefit.\n(Reprinted with permission from Environmental Nutrition, a monthly publication of Belvoir Media Group, LLC. 800-829-5384. www.EnvironmentalNutrition.com.)\n(c) 2015 BELVOIR MEDIA GROUP.

45	Why did temple officials dispose of religious offerings?	According to Dr. Patryk Chudzik, so many ritual items were placed in the Chapel of Hathor that the temple administrator had to clean them up, resulting in a pile of rubbish. This would be similar to a modern cemetery manager clearing away accumulated offerings like flowers and mementos to make space for new ones.	['Trash Pile At Temple of Hatshepsut Yields A Heap Of Hathor Artifacts\nPolish archaeologists in Egypt were supporting a tomb ceiling when they realized that beneath their feet lay an unknown treasure trove. They had inadvertently discovered an ancient temple dump and strewn among the shattered ancient objects they excavated hundreds of votive offerings to the mistress of love, the goddess Hathor.\nIn 1961, the Polish professor Kazimierz Michalowskit led the first of that nation’s archaeological expeditions to preserve the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut. Located opposite the modern city of Luxor, on the east bank of the Nile River on the site of ancient Thebes, three massive terraces rise from the desert floor into the cliffs of Deir el-Bahari. This architectural wonder from the ancient world was built during the reign of Pharaoh Hatshepsut of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt, that spanned from 1550/1549 to 1292 BC.\nView of the rubble and trash discovered in the tomb under the Hatshepsut temple, where all the Hathor goddess figurines were discovered. (P. Chudzik/ PAP)\nExcavating the Hathor Goddess Chapel: One Man’s Trash, is an Archaeologists Treasure\nNow, six decades after Dr. Michalowskit’s 1960s mission, another team of Polish archaeologists were recently reconstructing a ceiling in the Hathor Goddess Chapel when they discovered a 3,500-year-old rubbish dump . From this unexpected treasure trove, the archaeologists excavated many delicately carved female figurines and other offerings to the sky goddess Hathor. Most often depicted as a cow or as a lady with cow ears, Hathor was the spiritual overseer of fertility, women and emotions.\nFragment of a coffin from a later burial. (M.Jawornicki / PAP)\nA report in Archaeonews lists the hundreds of artifacts as comprising: “cups, ceramic flasks with breast designs, painted plates and bowls with plant motifs.” While these symbolic items might not at first appear to be related, every single one can be related to the idea of being reborn from the Land of the Dead, Duat. It is thought that the votive offerings were left at the tomb site by local residents seeking protection from Hathor.\nThe archaeologists also discovered this wooden figurine which they believe could have been the owner of the tomb. (M. Jawornicki / PAP)\nThe Son or Wife of Pharaoh Mentuhotep II?\nDr. Patryk Chudzik from the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology of the University of Warsaw was the lead archaeologist on the recent excavations at the Hatshepsut temple. He told Polish media that his team “were afraid” that their dig might cause the ceiling of the tomb to collapse, and it was when supports were being built that the dump was inspected and cleaned, “as it lay on top of a cemetery.”\nBurial goods from the early Middle Kingdom demonstrated that the archaeological layer was about 500 years older than the Temple of Hatshepsut, but the bulk of the discovered items date from the New Kingdom period. A carved wooden man was also discovered which is thought to represent the person for whom the tomb was built.\nDr. Chudzik said of this man that he was “a person closely related to the pharaoh Mentuhotep II - possibly his son or wife.” And having royal associations offers reason as to why so much looting has occurred in this particular tomb over the centuries.\nThe Polish archaeologists have been working at the Temple of Hatshepsut site for decades. (Ian Lloyd / CC BY-SA 3.0 )\nGetting Rid of the Old at the Temple of Hatshepsut\nCurrently, the archaeologists have no idea why so many Hathor goddess figurines were put into this one tomb. However, Dr. Patryk Chudzik believes that so many ritual items were placed in the Chapel of Hathor that “the temple administrator had to clean them up, resulting in a pile of rubbish.” In modern terms, this would be like a cemetery manager dumping all of the flowers, teddy bears and sentimental offerings at a graveyard into a skip, to make way for more.\n- Ritual Tools Used to Honor Goddess Hathor Found in Ancient Egyptian Temple Mound\n- The Magnificent Temple of Hathor, Goddess of Love: Best Preserved Temple in all of Egypt\nWhat is currently a mystery at the site is why so many 18th Dynasty painted pots and bowls were found in the dump, so long after the tomb was originally built. Furthermore, among the discarded piles of artifacts the researchers identified several stone blocks from the sanctuary of Amun, in the Hatshepsut temple. Knowing the provenance of these stones, Dr. Chudzik said they, and other artifacts, will now be returned to their original place within the temple.\nTop image: Small female figurines left as votive offerings to the goddess Hathor.

46	As a music producer focusing on electronic music history, I'm curious how Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream's approach to live performances differ, particularly in terms of improvisation and structure?	Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream have notably different approaches to live performances. While Kraftwerk focused on structured, robotic presentations that showcased their machine-like image through photo sessions and concerts, Tangerine Dream combines both structure and improvisation in their shows. The current Tangerine Dream lineup stays close to original tracks during the main set but includes a significant improvisation session at the end of each concert that can last between 20 to 120 minutes, where they create spontaneous music influenced by the environment, audience, venue, and recent experiences.	"['BRIEF OVERVIEW: KRAFTWERK: THE MODERN IGOR STRAVINSKY\nKraftwerk (German for ""power plant""), formerly Organisation, are the fathers of electronica and one of the most important and influential musicians of the 20th century. With many lineups spanning their entire career (typical in rock bands), they started out as a krautrock band before they became experimenal-avant garde and eventually electronic, a journey that would forever impact electronic music.\nEmerging from the experimental rock seeds of German bands Can and Tangerine Dream in the late 60s and educated in the classical music world and diving into the progressive rock era, Florian Schneider Esleben and Ralf Hutter of Dusseldorf, Germany were the principal members of the group, debuting in 1970 with their RCA records album Tone Float under the moniker Organisation. However, album sales flopped, and it wasn\'t before long when they changed their name to Kraftwerk and began to delve more into minimal electronic music, a time when most other artists stayed with their traditional instruments.\nKraftwerk\'s 1970 debut album Kraftwerk 1 really scratched the surface, but it was the 1974 single ""Autobahn"" from the album of the same name that got heads looking their way (by this time, important members Wolfgang Flur and Klaus Roeder joined the duo). A track comprising 22 minutes and 30 seconds, the song had to be shortened down to 9 minutes to be released as a single and the results proved fruitful: an international Top 10 smash. The song became a breakthrough in music history because for one it established a pop-structured electronic song and helped boost their album Autobahn into Top 40 chart success.\n""Autobahn"" paved the way to 1975\'s Radioactivity (boasting the hit single ""Radio-Activity""), Trans-Europe Express (boasting the seminal title track), and their masterpiece, the 1978 album The Man Machine.\nThis particular album was the height of their career in terms of musical performance and was the inspiration for their robotic image which they fully showcased to the public, be it through photo sessions or concerts.\nAfter a nearly three year hiatus from The Man Machine, Kraftwerk came back in 1981 to release Computer World just as the new decade was overtaken by the Electronic a.k.a. Computer Age. Their double single ""Computer Love"" b/w ""The Model"" may have topped the British charts in December of that same year, but the most important song off the album was ""Numbers"" which many songs, including Afrika Bambaataa\'s ""Planet Rock"", sampled from.\nIn 1986, Kraftwerk came back to release Electric Café, an album that fared well in sells. However, the music world was already deeply immersed in electronic music for Kraftwerk to really make any impact or concoct any recording novelties and from their disappeared from the scene.\nBy the late 90s, Kraftwerk began to tour again and worked on new material, releasing their first single in 13 years by the end of 1999 titled ""Expo 2000"". In August 2003, the band released their first album in more than 15 years. Despite the longevity and significance of the band\'s career, Kraftwerk has remained an underrated and underappreciated fixture in music history as a whole. Although some do acknowledge Kraftwerk\'s importance, many can\'t explain how and why they are truly one of music\'s most important artists. They helped make synthesized music mainstream and created the basic foundation for electronica, impacting modern music alongside giants such as Igor Stravinsky. The biggest genres, from rock, rap, R&B, and dance, owe some of their success to these legends.\nKohoutek 7"" single 1973\nTrans Europe Expresss 1977\nMusically, Kraftwerk dealt with postwar European urban life and technology, celebrating (such as in the beautiful track ""Neon Lights"") but at the same time cautioning the world about machinesÕ advantages and disadvantages. Through their lyricism, rhythms, and vocoder-processed voices, they tried to reflect the minimalism and lackluster characteristics of machines into their works. They were one of the several people who predicted that technology would dominate the world and were surely way ahead of their time musically.\nDuring Kraftwerk\'s beginning stages, their music was known as ""techno"" (which the band used for a while) or ""robot pop"". However, purists also called it ""robo sh*t"" or ""noise"", a term that would later affect hip hop and dance/electronica.\nUsing their skills, creativity, and talent, Kraftwerk created a fundamental electronic track with ""Autobahn"". This song incorporated sounds from their drive in an auto-bahn recorded through a microphone which they later synthesized to give their record a more crisp and pleasant sound. Breaking through internationally, this is the song (or one of the songs) that gave dance/electronica its basic structure.\nAlso, another important fundamental electronic track was Hot Butter\'s 1972 summer anthem ""Popcorn"" which also broke through and helped set the basic foundation for electronica. However, Kraftwerk\'s ""Autobahn"" really gave the music more of a strutcture which would virtually rule all of dance/electronica in the coming decades.\nON \'TRANS-EUROPE EXPRESS\'\nAlthough only a moderate hit during its 1977 release, this is still another brilliant record that has stood the test of time. More electronic than ""Auto-Bahn"", this would become one of Kraftwerk\'s most sampled records alongside giants such as ""Numbers"" and ""We Are the Robots"". Afrika Bambaataa and The Soul Sonic Force used the song\'s beat to as the backbone for their hit ""Planet Rock"".\nAnother important and sampled record, ""Numbers"" has also stood the test of time. Afrika Bambaataa also used the beat and certain phrases from the song in ""Planet Rock"".\nHOW ABOUT PINK FLOYD ET AL.?\nYes, there were several other artists in the late 60s and 70s experimenting with electronics such as Yes, Frank Zappa & The Mother\'s Invention, King Crimson, Brian Eno, Jean Michel Jarre, Gary Numan, Emerson, Lake, & Palmer, David Bowie (he even created a tune called ""V-2 Schneider"" in honor of Florian), Genesis, The Grateful Dead, The Beatles (their album Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band contains electronic manipulation and samples), and Pink Floyd (whose influential The Dark Side of the Moon included loops, synthesizers, and sampling), but Kraftwerk was a band that fully dealt with electronics and took it beyond human thought with their skills and music innovation, bridging the classical music of Karlheinz Stockhausen with electronic music and became important avant-garde enthusiasts. Therefore, they are the fathers of dance/electronica.\n(First LP) 1970\nThe Man Machine 1978\nElectric Cafe 1986\nKraftwerk influenced many artists. In the 70s, it was rockers David Bowie, Gary Numan, Giorgio Moroder, and Iggy Pop and DJs such as Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash who played their records before interested black audiences. Later, artists such as Herbie Hanock, The Human League, Depeche Mode, OMD (Orchestral Manouevres in the Dark), Michael Jackson, Whodini, The Balanescu Quartet, New Order, Bauhaus, Throbbing Gristle, and Arthur Baker also began to be influenced by them.\nThe secret to Kraftwerk\'s sound lies in their inspirations from classical composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, rock outfits Tangerine Dream and The Beach Boys, and the influence of Art Deco (a major style/decorative art movement in Europe from the 1920s that particularly affected architechture).\nKraftwerk is the most sampled band of all time with James Brown being the most sampled artist of all time. In artists being sampled as a whole, they\'re still second place to James Brown.\nArtists that sampled Kraftwerk:\nArtists that covered Kraftwerk:\nTour De France\n(We Are) The Robots\nMusique Non Stop\nThe Telephone Call\nThe Fearless 4\nThe Treacherous 3\nDe La Soul\nThe Bloodhound Gang\nBig Audio Dynamite\nMeat Beat Manifesto\nThe 2 Live Crew\nThe Village People\nThe Chemical Brothers\nBalanescu Quartet (classical group)\nOrchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark\nSiouxsie and The Banshees\nTo discuss Kraftwerk with others, sign up for our\nforum and check out the \'Favorite Artists\' section.', ""Founded in 1967 by Edgar Froese in Berlin, Tangerine Dream's career has spanned multiple decades. Since Froese's passing, the group has been under the leadership of Thorsten Quaeschning, his chosen successor.\nCurrently, the line-up consists of Thorsten Quaeschning, a composer and synthesizer player who joined Tangerine Dream twenty years ago (making him the second longest-serving member in the band's history after Edgar Froese), Hoshiko Yamane - who has been the band's violinist since 2011, and Paul Frick who joined in 2020.\nThorsten worked with Edgar for over 12 years and lived in his house for half of each year. Their relationship can be described as a master-and-student dynamic, where Edgar taught Thorsten about the philosophy behind the music, scales, and different approaches to sound and procedures; these guidelines would continue to be followed by the current lineup.\nTangerine Dream continue the legacy of the band, was honored to ask Thorsten some questions below...\nSynth History: What are some of the synthesizers in your current live setup? Do these synths differ from the ones used in the recording studio? If so, what are some synthesizers used in the studio but not taken on the road?\nThorsten: Live sets are always a compromise, but the band pays enormous attention to sound and detail. The U.S./Canada setup includes a Modular system, Manikin Electronic Schrittmacher Step Sequencer, SH101, Roland Juno 106, Roland JDXA, Roland System 8, two Moog Minotaurs, Moog Sirin, Ableton Live, iPad Pro, and some Arturia and Clavia synthesizers. In Europe, they add a Waldorf Quantum, Moog Voyager, Moog Voyager RME, Manikin Electronic Memotron, Roland V-Synth, a larger Modular system, and many hardware effects from Lexicon, TC Electronics, and Strymon, among others. In the studio consists of a vast array of synthesizers, including a Marienberg Modular, Roland Jupiter 8, additional Voyagers and Minimoogs, Roland JD 800, JP8000, Korg Z1, Prophecy, Mi1r, 01W Pro, Wavestation EX, and many more.\nSynth History: When performing live, do you think it’s important to improvise or stick to a plan?\nThorsten: At the end of each concert, Tangerine Dream performs a real-time improvisation, known as a session, that can last from 20 to 120 minutes. This is spontaneously created music, influenced by the environment, audience, venue, and recent experiences. During the main set, the band stays close to the original tracks, spanning from the seventies to post-2005 material.\nSynth History: What is some advice you have for artists looking to bring their sound in the studio to the stage?\nThorsten: Create quality live versions of your songs. If you can't bring all your instruments on stage, sample the important sounds. Keep the setup manageable yet detailed, and take the music seriously, if not necessarily yourself.\nSynth History: What is some advice for someone looking to get over stage freight?\nThorsten: There's probably no need to entirely overcome it. Be meticulous about your practice, gear, and cables, and be aware that unexpected factors like updates, force majeure, humans, poor MIDI cables and unstable router connections could destroy the world and interfere the space-time-continuum.\nTangerine Dream are performing at The Vermont in Hollywood on Tuesday, September 19th.

47	Can you tell me how the practice of wearing a special necklace with Shiva's symbol became available to everyone in ancient India?	Basava introduced the Ishtalinga necklace, with an image of the Shiva Liṅga, to every person regardless of his or her birth, to be a constant reminder of one's bhakti (devotion) to Shiva. This was part of his rejection of gender and social discrimination.	"['|Part of a series on|\n|Beliefs and practices|\n|Part of a series on|\n|Hindu scriptures and texts|\n|Related Hindu texts|\nBasaveshwara, colloquially known as Basavanna, was a 12th-century CE Indian statesman, philosopher, poet, social reformer and Lingayat saint in the Shiva-focussed bhakti movement, and a Hindu Shaivite social reformer during the reign of the Kalyani Chalukya/Kalachuri dynasty. Basava was active during the rule of both dynasties but reached the peak of his influence during the rule of King Bijjala II in Karnataka, India.\nBasava spread social awareness through his poetry, popularly known as Vachanaas. He rejected gender or social discrimination, superstitions and rituals but introduced Ishtalinga necklace, with an image of the Shiva Liṅga, to every person regardless of his or her birth, to be a constant reminder of one\'s bhakti (devotion) to Shiva. As the chief minister of his kingdom, he introduced new public institutions such as the Anubhava Mantapa (or, the ""hall of spiritual experience""), which welcomed men and women from all socio-economic backgrounds to discuss spiritual and mundane questions of life, in open.\nThe traditional legends and hagiographic texts state Basava to be the founder of the Lingayats. However, modern scholarship relying on historical evidence such as the Kalachuri inscriptions state that Basava was the poet philosopher who revived, refined and energized an already existing tradition. The Basavarajadevara Ragale (13 out of 25 sections are available) by the Kannada poet Harihara (c.1180) is the earliest available account on the life of the social reformer and is considered important because the author was a near contemporary of his protagonist. A full account of Basava\'s life and ideas are narrated in a 13th-century sacred Telugu text, the Basava Purana by Palkuriki Somanatha.\nBasava was born in 1131 CE in the town of Basavana Bagewadi in the northern part of Karnataka, to Maadarasa and Madalambike, a Kannada Orthodox Brahmin family devoted to Hindu deity Vishnu. He was named Basava, a Kannada form of the Sanskrit Vrishabha in honor of Nandi bull (carrier of Shiva) and the local Shaivism tradition.\nBasava grew up in Kudalasangama (northwest Karnataka), near the banks of rivers Krishna and its tributary Malaprabha. Basava spent twelve years studying in the Hindu temple in the town of Kudalasangama, at Sangameshwara then a Shaivite school of learning, probably of the Lakulisha-Pashupata tradition.\nBasava married Gangambike, a cousin from his mother\'s side. Her father was the provincial prime minister of Bijjala, the Kalachuri king. He began working as an accountant to the court of the king. When his maternal uncle died, the king invited him to be the chief minister. The king also married Basava\'s sister named Nagamma.\nAs chief minister of the kingdom, Basava used the state treasury to initiate social reforms and religious movement focussed on reviving Shaivism, recognizing and empowering ascetics who were called Jangamas. One of the innovative institutions he launched in the 12th century was the Anubhava Mantapa, a public assembly and gathering that attracted men and women across various walks of life from distant lands to openly discuss spiritual, economic and social issues of life. He composed poetry in local language, and spread his message to the masses. His teachings and verses such as Káyakavé Kailása (Work is the path to Kailash [bliss, heaven], or Work is Worship) became popular.\nSeveral works are attributed to Basava, which are revered in the Veerashaiva Lingayat community. These include various Vachana such as the Shat-sthala-vachana (discourses of the six stages of salvation), Kala-jnana-vachana (forecasts of the future), Mantra-gopya, Ghatachakra-vachana and Raja-yoga-vachana.\nThe Basava Purana, a Telugu biographical epic poem, first written by Palkuriki Somanatha in 13th-century, and an updated 14th century Kannada version, written by Bhima Kavi in 1369, are sacred texts in Veerashaiva Lingayat.\nOther hagiographic works include the 15th-century Mala Basava-raja-charitre and the 17th-century Vrishabhendra Vijaya, both in Kannada.\nScholars state that the poems and legends about Basava were written down long after his death. This has raised questions about the accuracy and creative interpolation by authors who were not direct witness but derived their work relying on memory, legends, and hearsay of others. Michael states, ""All \'Vachana\'collections as they exist at present are probably much later than the 15th-century [300 years post-Basava]. Much critical labor needs to be spent in determining the authenticity of portions of these collections"".\nBasava grew up in a Shaivite family. As a leader, he developed and inspired a new devotional movement named Virashaivas, or ""ardent, heroic worshippers of Shiva"". This movement shared its roots in the ongoing Tamil Bhakti movement, particularly the Shaiva Nayanars traditions, over the 7th- to 11th-century. However, Basava championed devotional worship that rejected temple worship and rituals led by Brahmins and replaced it with personalized direct worship of Shiva through practices such as individually worn icons and symbols like a small linga. This approach brought Shiva\'s presence to everyone and at all times, without gender, class or caste discriminationHisBasava\'s poem, such as Basavanna 703, speak of strong sense of gender equality and community bond, willing to wage war for the right cause, yet being a fellow ""devotees\' bride"" at the time of his or her need.\nA recurring contrast in his poems and ideas is of Sthavara and Jangama, that is, of ""what is static, standing"" and ""what is moving, seeking"" respectively. Temples, ancient books represented the former, while work and discussion represented the latter.\nwill make temples for Shiva,\nWhat shall I,\na poor man do?\nMy legs are pillars,\nthe body the shrine,\nthe head a cupola of gold.\nListen, O lord of the meeting rivers,\nthings standing shall fall,\nbut the moving ever shall stay.— Basavanna 820, Translated by Ramanujan\nBasava emphasized constant personal spiritual development as the path to profound enlightenment. He championed the use of vernacular language, Kannada, in all spiritual discussions so that translation and interpretation by the elite is unnecessary, and everyone can understand the spiritual ideas. His approach is akin to the protestant movement, states Ramanuja. His philosophy revolves around treating one\'s own body and soul as a temple; instead of making a temple, he suggests being the temple. His trinity consisted of guru (teacher), linga (personal symbol of Shiva) and jangama (constantly moving and learning).\nBasava established, in 12th-century, Anubhava Mantapa, a hall for gathering and discussion of spiritual ideas by any member of the society from both genders, where ardent devotees of Shiva shared their achievements and spiritual poems in the local language. He questioned rituals, dualism, and externalization of god, and stated that the true God is ""one with himself, self-born"".\nHow can I feel right\nabout a god who eats up lacquer and melts,\nwho wilts when he sees a fire?\nHow can I feel right\nabout gods you sell in your need,\nand gods you bury for fear of thieves?\nThe lord Kudalasangama,\nself-born, one with himself,\nhe alone is the true god.— Basavanna 558, Translated by Ramanujan\nWhile Basava rejected rituals, he encouraged icons and symbols such as the wearing of Istalinga (necklace with personal linga, symbol of Shiva), of Rudraksha seeds or beads on parts of one body, and apply Vibhuti (sacred ash on forehead) as a constant reminder of one\'s devotion and principles of faith. Another aid to faith, he encouraged was the six-syllable mantra, Shivaya Namah, or the shadhakshara mantra which is Om Namah Shivaya.\nBhakti marga as the path to liberation\nThe Basava Purana, in Chapter 1, presents a series of impassioned debates between Basava and his father. Both declare Hindu Sruti and Smriti to be sources of valid knowledge, but they disagree on the marga (path) to liberated, righteous life. Basava\'s father favors the tradition of rituals, while Basava favors the path of direct, personal devotion (bhakti).\nAccording to Velcheru Rao and Gene Roghair, Basava calls the path of devotion as ""beyond six systems of philosophy. Sruti has commended it as the all-seeing. the beginning of the beginning. The form of that divine linga is the true God. The guru [teacher] of the creed is an embodiment of kindness and compassion. He places God in your soul, and he also places God in your hand. The six-syllabled mantra, the supreme mantra, is its mantra. The dress – locks of hair, ashes and rudrashaka beads – place a man beyond the cycle of birth and death. It follows the path of liberation. (...) This path offers nothing less than liberation in this lifetime.""\nRoots in the Vedanta philosophy\nSripati, a Virasaiva scholar, explained Basava\'s philosophy in Srikara Bhasya, using the Vedanta Sutra, suggesting Basava\'s Lingayat theology to be a form of qualified nondualism, wherein the individual Atma (soul) is the body of God, and that there is no difference between Shiva and Atma(self, soul), Shiva is one\'s Atma, one\'s Atma is Shiva. Sripati\'s analysis places Basava\'s views in Vedanta school, in a form closer to the 11th century Vishishtadvaita philosopher Ramanuja, than to Advaita philosopher Adi Shankara. However, Sripati\'s analysis has been contested by other scholars.\nLegacy and influence\nModern scholarship relying on historical evidence such as the Kalachuri inscriptions state that Basava was the 12th-century poet-philosopher who revived and energized an already existing tradition. The community he helped form is also known as the Sharanas. The community is largely concentrated in Karnataka, but has migrated into other states of India as well as overseas. Towards the end of the 20th century, Michael estimates, one-sixth of the population of the state of Karnataka, or about 10 million people, were Veerashaiva Lingayat or of the tradition champione by Basava.\nBasava taught that every human being was equal, irrespective of caste, and that all forms of manual labor was equally important. Michael states that it wasn\'t birth but behavior that determined a true saint and Shaiva bhakta in the view of Basava and the Sharanas community. This, writes Michael, was also the position of south Indian man, that it was ""behavior, not birth"" that determines the true man. One difference between the two was that Sharanas welcomed anyone, whatever occupation he or she might have been born in, to convert and be reborn into the larger family of Shiva devotees and then adopt any occupation he or she wanted.\nSynthesis of diverse Hindu traditions\nBasava is credited with uniting diverse spiritual trends during his era. Jan Peter Schouten states that Virashaivism, the movement championed by Basava, tends towards monotheism with Shiva as the godhead, but with a strong awareness of the unity of the Ultimate Reality. Schouten calls this as a synthesis of Ramanuja\'s Vishishtadvaita and Shankara\'s Advaita traditions, naming it Shakti-Vishishtadvaita, that is monism fused with Shakti beliefs. An individual\'s spiritual progress is viewed by Basava\'s tradition as a six-stage Satsthalasiddhanta, which progressively evolves the individual through phase of the devotee, to phase of the master, then phase of the receiver of grace, thereafter Linga in life-breath (god dwells in his or her soul), the phase of surrender (awareness of no distinction in god and soul, self), to the last stage of complete union of soul and god (liberation, mukti). Basava\'s approach is different than Adi Shankara, states Schouten, in that Basava emphasizes the path of devotion, compared to Shankara\'s emphasis on the path of knowledge – a system of monistic Advaita philosophy widely discussed in Karnataka in the time of Basava.\nIcons and symbols\nadvocated the wearing of Ishtalinga, a necklace with pendant that contains a small Shiva linga. He was driven by his realization; in one of his Vachanas he says Arive Guru, which means one\'s own awareness is his/her teacher. Many contemporary Vachanakaras (people who have scripted Vachanas) have described him as Swayankrita Sahaja, which means ""self-made"".\nMonuments and recognition\n- The then President of India Abdul Kalam inaugurated Basaveshwara\'s statue on 28 April 2003 in the Parliament of India.\n- Basaveshwara is the first Kannadiga in whose honour a commemorative coin has been minted in recognition of his social reforms.The former Prime Minister of India, Dr Manmohan Singh was in Bengaluru, the capital of Karnataka to release the coins.\n- On 14 November 2015 The Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi inaugurated the statue of Basaveshwara along the bank of the river Thames at Lambeth in London.\n- Basava Dharma Peetha has constructed 108 ft (33 m) tall statue of Basava in Basavakalyana.\n- Jestice, Phyllis G.

48	tap water contamination types prevention methods	Water contamination occurs through two main types of backflow: backsiphonage (caused by pressure loss creating a vacuum that draws contaminated water back) and backpressure (when a source creates pressure exceeding the public water supply pressure). To prevent contamination, several types of backflow prevention assemblies can be used: Air Gap (AG), Reduced Pressure Principle Assembly (RP), Double Check Valve Assembly (DC), Pressure Vacuum Breaker (PVB), Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker (AVB), and Spill-Proof Pressure Vacuum Breaker (SVB). These assemblies protect against both pollutants (affecting taste, color, or odor) and contaminants (substances that may cause illness or death).	"['A cross-connection is an actual or potential connection between a public water system or consumer\'s potable (drinking) water system and any source or system containing non-potable water or other substances. (Non-potable water is water that is unfit or unsafe to drink.)\nWater normally flows in one direction, from the public water system through your water service, to your plumbing fixtures. However, under certain conditions water can flow in the reverse direction – creating “backflow”. Backflow can contaminate the water supply and cause serious health issues. Backflow is the reverse flow of non-potable water or other substances through a cross-connection hazard into the piping of the consumer\'s potable water system or the public water system.\nThere are two conditions that can cause backflow:\n1. Backsiphonage – occurs due to a loss of pressure in the public water system providing your water. This can be caused by a rapid withdrawal of a high volume of water from the system due to a system shutdown, a break in the supply mains, or active fire protection. This reduction of pressure creates a vacuum in the piping which draws water back into your home from your irrigation lines, hot tub, or any plumbing fixture with a submerged inlet. These sources of water can contaminate your home’s drinking water and even enter the public system contaminating others’ potable water.\n2. Backpressure – is created when the source of pressure, such as a household pump, creates pressure greater than that supplied through the public water system. A pump from a landscape pond, pool, hot tub, hydronic heating system, fire sprinkler system or other system containing non-potable water, pumps that water into the potable water supply affecting your home, and even the entire public drinking water system.\nA backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical device that prevents water from ""backflowing"" into a potable water system (either the consumer’s internal system, the public water system, or both).\nYes, there are several different types of backflow prevention assemblies, which are listed below:\n• Air Gap (AG)\n• Reduced Pressure Principle Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP)\n• Double Check Valve Backflow Prevention Assembly (DC)\n• Pressure Vacuum Breaker (PVB)\n• Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker (AVB)\n• Spill-Proof Pressure Vacuum Breaker (SVB)\nThe North Tahoe Public Utility District (District) recognizes all of these as acceptable forms of cross-connection control. However, each assembly must be approved prior to installation to ensure that the assembly is on the approved list and that the type of assembly used shall be based on the existing or potential degree of hazard.\nThe District can tell you which type of assembly is appropriate for your particular need. You may then choose the specific model from a list of approved assemblies available at the District office, or you can work with a Backflow Prevention Assembly General Tester or Cross-Connection Control Specialist to select a specific assembly.\nThe District maintains a list of currently approved testers, available on our website. Some of these testers are also Cross-Connection Control Specialists, which can be determined by speaking with each company.\nIn order to protect your family’s health and the public drinking water system, the State of California requires all water suppliers to maintain ongoing backflow prevention and cross-connection control programs so that your water is protected from hazards that originate on private property. The California Department of Public Health requires the District to eliminate cross-connections by maintaining these programs. The backflow prevention and cross-connection control program mandates the installation of backflow prevention assemblies by the consumer where the District determines they are needed, in accordance with Title 17 of California state law and District Water Ordinance 11.\nA plumber, fire sprinkler contractor, landscaper, Backflow Prevention Assembly General Tester, or anyone with plumbing expertise can install an assembly. However, only Backflow Prevention Assembly General Testers holding current certification by the California-Nevada Section of the American Water Works Association (AWWA) can test, maintain and repair backflow prevention assemblies. The tester must provide the District with evidence of AWWA certification and proof that the test equipment he or she will use is currently calibrated. The District maintains a list of currently approved testers, available on our website.\nThe installation of the assembly must be inspected and approved by the District. Call the Water Quality Technician to schedule an inspection.\nAfter the installation has been inspected and approved, the assembly must be tested. Per California State Law, all backflow prevention assemblies must be tested upon installation. A District-approved, certified Backflow Prevention Assembly General Tester must test the assembly to ensure that it is operating correctly and will complete the District’s “Backflow Prevention Assembly Test Report”, available on our website or at our office. The tester will then mail, fax, or email the completed form back to the District.\nBackflow prevention assemblies protect against two types of hazards: pollutants and contaminants.\n1. A Pollutant – is any substance which affects the aesthetic quality of the water (taste, color or odor), but does not pose a health hazard.\n2. A Contaminant – may cause illness or death when ingested, and is considered to be a health hazard. Some common examples of hazards or systems requiring backflow prevention assemblies are:\n• Fire Sprinkler Systems\n• Hydronic Heating Systems\n• Irrigation Systems\n• Boilers/Water Heat Exchangers\n• Auxiliary Water Supplies (e.g., lake intakes, wells)\nAn auxiliary water supply is a water source on your property in addition to the public drinking water service. An auxiliary water supply can be any one of the following: well, lake intake, stream/river intake, spring, rainwater cistern, grey water, etc.\nWhen there is an auxiliary water supply on a property, it can be a potential cross-connection if that auxiliary supply accidentally gets connected to the public drinking water supply. For example, if your property has a lake intake or a private well that feeds your irrigation system, but your irrigation system is also fed from the public water system, the water from the auxiliary supply could get into the public drinking water system. For properties with an auxiliary water supply, the District requires an approved backflow prevention assembly to be installed at the meter.\nYes, even if it is a drip irrigation system. Weed killers, fertilizers and animal waste may enter the water supply through an irrigation system that is not properly protected with a backflow prevention assembly, contaminating the water. District staff will help you determine which assembly is the right one for your particular needs.\nYes. In our cold climate, fire sprinkler systems are typically charged with a glycol solution. Additionally, systems constructed out of black iron pipe typically contain a rust inhibitor. Even systems that are charged only with water may be hazardous to the water supply. Bacterial growth can occur in the stagnant water, which sits undisturbed in the pipes for many years. A loss of system pressure can draw this polluted or contaminated water into your own system and potentially into the District’s water supply. Systems that are charged only with air, but include a Fire Department Connection (FDC) also pose a hazard to the water supply; if the FDC is connected to a fire truck during a fire situation, the potential exists for water that may contain other substances to backflow into the drinking water supply.\nTitle 17 of California state law and District Water Ordinance 11 requires annual testing of backflow prevention assemblies to ensure that they are functioning properly. With the exception of the air gap, backflow prevention assemblies are mechanical units with internal seals, springs, and moving parts that are subject to fouling, wear, or fatigue. The annual test ensures a properly functioning assembly, and certifies that the assembly has not been removed or had a by-pass line installed around it. Air gaps are “tested” by conducting a visual inspection.\nNot for most hazards. However, when there is an auxiliary water supply, medical facility, lethal hazard,failure to allow the District to perform a cross-connection inspection, or other circumstance, asdetermined by the District, backflow prevention assemblies must be installed immediately behind themeter, on private property. RP backflow prevention assemblies installed at the meter must be installed in an above-ground, continually heated enclosure. DC backflow prevention assemblies installed at the meter may be installed in an underground box or vault, but must be approved on a case-by-case basis.\nIn general, the District has taken the approach of requiring internal protection with regards to the installation of backflow prevention assemblies, in order to protect the drinking water within the property as well as the public water system. This approach has been determined to be the best method for the protection of public health and safety. Furthermore, requiring internal protection, at the point of potential cross-connection, typically allows our customers to install smaller backflow prevention assemblies within their structure, and generally eliminates the need to house these assemblies in an above-ground, continually heated enclosure.\nBackflow prevention assemblies are designed to be installed above-ground. However, because of our severe winters, the District may approve the installation of a DC within an underground box, on a case-by-case basis. RPs and vacuum breakers may never be installed in a box or vault, as this installation would subject the assembly to potentially becoming submerged in the underground box or vault, rendering it ineffective. (RPs and vacuum breakers are open to the atmosphere, which, if submerged, would create another cross-connection).\nFailure to install the required type of assembly could result in termination of water service as described in the District’s Water Ordinance 11. The District will work with you to ensure that you are able to install the assembly, by selecting a location that would allow for the smallest size and fewest amount of assemblies, if more than one assembly is required. The District will also work with you to select a due date that is reasonable given your budget and schedule, while still addressing this matter in a timely fashion.\nThe form is available on the District’s website. Alternatively, you can call the District and request that a copy be emailed, faxed or mailed to you, or stop by the office to pick one up.\nYes! Backflow prevention assemblies, particularly irrigation assemblies, will freeze if left exposed. They must be kept from freezing by providing insulation and by providing a heat source, if needed. Irrigation assemblies are recommended to be installed with unions on either side, which will allow them to be removed during the winter months. Other assemblies can often be installed within the building in a heated area. District staff will help determine what location is appropriate for the assembly. We will endeavor to allow you to install the assembly within the building to prevent it from freezing.\nThe District maintains a database containing all of the permitted backflow prevention assemblies within our water system. We will notify you when your assembly is due to be tested, and we will provide you with a test form accompanied by a list of certified Backflow Prevention Assembly General Testers. It is the customer\'s responsibility to schedule the test with the tester. These notifications are typically sent out the first of June of every year, with a typical test due date of the end of August. Mark your calendars to have your assembly tested every spring!\nYes. The District owns and maintains 28 backflow prevention assemblies throughout our service area. We test all irrigation assemblies prior to first use each season, and test the remaining assemblies by the same due date as our customers.\nA stop and waste drain and a stop and waste valve are the same thing. A stop and waste valve is used to drain the piping above or beyond it, when it is in a closed position. These are typically used on irrigation lines and for domestic water service lines.\nThese can be a potential cross-connection if the stop and waste valve is installed below the ground surface; the water (including any contaminants, such as chemicals, dirt, bacteria, fertilizer, etc.) can pool up and then enter your internal plumbing and potentially the drinking water system through the valve when it is opened back up.The California Plumbing Code and the District requires that “Combination stop-and-waste valves…shall not be installed underground.”\nA yard hydrant and a frost-free/freeze proof hose bibb are the same thing. A yard hydrant is an outdoor water supply outlet that has a valve and outlet above ground and a drain opening below the frost level. When the valve is opened, water flows. When the valve is closed, the water supply to the hydrant is shut off below the frost level and a drain hole is opened that allows the water in the yard hydrant pipe to drain into a gravel bed. This drains the yard hydrant and its riser so that the hydrant will not freeze.\nA yard hydrant can be a potential cross-connection through the drain hole; when a backsiphonage condition occurs, contaminants (such as chemicals, dirt, bacteria, fertilizer, etc.) can potentially enter your internal plumbing and the public drinking water system through the drain hole.\nThe District requires that yard hydrants have an RP assembly installed upstream of them, or that they are replaced with a sanitary yard hydrant. A sanitary yard hydrant still has a drain hole, but the water drains into a sealed tank. When the hydrant is turned on again, the water in the tank is expelled; there is no crosscontamination with the yard hydrant and the soil.\nFor approved sanitary yard hydrants, contact the District.\nFor more information:\n• Visit our website, at www.ntpud.org/bfp\n• View the District’s Water Ordinance at http://ntpud.org/sites/default/files/docs/general/\n• For any other questions, please use the following contact information:\nMichael D. Warren\nLead Water Quality Control Technician\nNorth Tahoe Public Utility District\n530-546-4212 ext 5452', 'What is a cross connection?\nWherever physical cross connections exist between a potable and non-potable water, there is the potential for backflow to occur.\nWhat is backflow?\nBackflow is a flow of solid, liquid or gas from any source opposite to the normal direction of flow, back into the potable water supply or system due to back pressure or back siphonage.\nBack Pressure – is any condition where the pressure in a system becomes greater than the supply pressure feeding the system. It’s caused when a potable system is connected to a non-potable system that is operating at a higher pressure. Non-potable substances may be forced into the drinking water supply\nBack Siphonage – is caused by negative or reduced pressure in the supply piping. When pressure in a distribution system drops to atmospheric or below, a vacuum is created allowing water to siphon in the reverse flow. This condition is identical to drinking through a straw\nWhat does this mean to you?\nDepending on your business, property ect. It means if there is ever a backflow situation that occurs, and you do not have a backflow preventer in place, your water from your pool for example, could be siphoned back into your potable water, thats the same water you and your family use to drink, in turn possibly harming you and your family.\nIf you have irrigation, and one of the lines is broken, cracked and theres break in the municipal water main, and you’re not protected by a backflow preventer, you are facing the same scenario, except now you’re potentially facing fertilizers and whatever else may be in the ground/soil being pulled through into not only your drinking water, but all of those around you.\nThese are very basic examples and happen more commonly than one may think.\nWhen you get into more complex systems and commercial and industrial buildings and properties such as Morgues, Farms, Universities, Butchers, Restaurants, Bars, Distilleries, Breweries, Pharmaceutical Plants, Zoos, Mines, Mills etc. these are all examples of Severely HIGH RISK Cross Connections and Require the upmost protection.\nSome engineers may even make the decision to double up on certain valves for ultimate protection (but thats their specialty). It’s EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to keep on top of your backflow testing program (our Specialty) as you don’t want to be responsible for contaminating yours, your families, or the publics potable water systems due to neglect.\nRPBA – Reduced Pressure Backflow Assembly\nReduced Pressure Backflow Assemblies prevent the reverse flow of polluted water from entering into the potable water supply due to backsiphonage and or backpressure. It consists of bronze body construction (1/4 to 2 in., 8 to 50mm) or FDA approved epoxy coated cast iron (2 1/2 to 3 in., 65 to 80mm), two, in-line independent check valves, replaceable check seats with an intermediate relief valve, and ball valve test cocks. Ideal for protection of health hazard cross-connections or for containment at the service line entrance. Used in Severe Hazard situations. For example; Commercial laundry, sewage lift stations, petroleum processing, food and beverage processing plants, car wash facilities, dental clinics, tall buildings (protection against excessive head pressure) marinas, heat exchangers, etc.\nDCVA – Double Check Valve Assembly\nDouble Check Valve Assemblies prevent the backflow of contaminated water into the potable water supply. It consists of a bronze (1/2 to 2 in) body construction that is easy to maintain and service. These are used in Moderate Hazard situations. For example, steam generators, heating equipment, irrigation systems, swimming pools, vending machines, etc.\nPVB – Pressure Vacuum Breaker\n“Pressure Vacuum Breakers” and “Spill Resistant Pressure Vacuum Breakers” prevent the reverse flow of polluted water from entering into the potable water supply due to back syphonage. It consists of bronze body construction, silicone rubber check valve disc, plastic check valve seat, stainless steel springs, a bonnet with silicone rubber O-ring seal, a lightweight plastic disc float, tee handle or lever handle shutoffs, and test cocks. Ideal in health hazard continuous pressure applications such as irrigation systems and industrial process water systems where the water enters the equipment at or below its flood rim.

49	Are Buddhist monks and Catholic seminarians both required to undergo lengthy discernment processes?	Yes, both paths require lengthy discernment processes. Buddhist monastic candidates need to spend at least 3 months at a monastery to get past the 'honeymoon stage' and make a wise decision, while Catholic seminary formation takes 7-9 years with ongoing discernment throughout each phase of formation.	"['dedicated to a peaceful & just society\ngrounded in contemplative & spiritual practice\nI receive many inquiries about ordaining as Buddhist monks and nuns, even tho I haven\'t been a monk for almost 4 years now! I hope this page will provide some practical guidance.\nBecome a Buddhist monastic is a gradual process that requires patience. I know men who have hurried into it; in many cases that did not work out for the best, whether for them or the monastic communities (such as mine) that had to deal with their impatience. On the other hand, people who have a true monastic calling can take their time (tho not dawdling) and make wise choices. They become mature monks and nuns, and their communities are enriched by their life, practice, and service.\nHere are some steps that I suggest you follow. These suggestions are written for both men and women. At the end are additional considerations for women (equality is not the status quo).\nDecide the orientation of your practice & understanding of Buddhism. Is it primarily Theravada? Zen? Tibetan? Chinese Ch\'an? Within that tradition (there\'s diversity in all the major schools), which flavors of teaching & practice (e.g. Thai forest or Tibetan Nyingma) are most meaningful for you?\nFind out which monastic teachers in that tradition and flavor have training monasteries able to accommodate foreigners. (Some do and some don\'t. Those that don\'t lack, for instance, English speaking teachers and translators, or unknowingly impose too much of the local culture.) Nowadays, you may find some of these teachers living in the West; others are based in Asia. Which of these teachers inspire you enough to possibly live in obedience to them for a number of years?\nVisit 2 or 3 of those monasteries. Spend a few weeks in each. (This may be a large investment of time and money for you, but it is important.) Find out if they actually train young monks & nuns, or do they just let you do your own thing. Do they follow Vinaya sufficiently?\nWhen you find a place that suits you and supports the kind of training you need (including Dhamma, meditation, & Vinaya), return for a at least a 3 month visit. 3 months is necessary for getting past the ""honeymoon stage"" in which you fall in love with the place and don\'t notice the warts. It won\'t be till you notice the limits & weaknesses (which every place has, including monasteries) that you can balance those with the strengths & positive qualities, and can make a wise decision. If you are overly idealistic about a place, you will be disappointed and may end up bitter.\nFind out what that monastery requires of ordination candidates. Begin the process. It might take a while.\nI hope this is helpful for you. These are broad guidelines.\nSome one like myself can not advise intelligently regarding the latter steps until you provide more information on the first, then proceed step by step from there.\nBuddhist monastic communities are usually hierarchal, whether in Asia or the West. Even when no monks are present, their influence may be substantial. If you expect equal treatment, you will be frustrated.\nA few monastic communities have made serious attempts to minimize gender hierarchy and patriarchy. If you have any feminist inclinations, you might want to check these out first.\nMore information from the Sakyadhita website.\nAre you prepared to sacrifice some of your individuality (habits, opinions, status) in order to fit into a healthy Sangha?\nAre your financial matters in order?\nIf you are over 30, are you ready for the physical hardships of monastic life, especially in the poorer Buddhist countries? Do you have health issues or special needs?\nAre you prepared to give up a career & property for a 3-5 year experiment (in case you drop out)?', 'Vocational formation and the new evangelization: Ongoing discernment\nThe 35-year old lawyer asks himself, “Do I leave the job that I love, sell my condo, and give up the life that I have been living to enter the Seminary? After all, I have been thinking about the priesthood since grade school.”\nThe 21-year old college student at the local state university has been volunteering on the weekends with a group of religious sisters visiting the sick, the elderly and the homebound. Although she has been excited about a career as an accountant, she is now wondering if God is calling her to be a religious sister serving the poor and the sick.\nThe senior at the Catholic high school is asked by his friends which colleges he is applying to. “None,” he answers confidently. “I’ve been talking to my pastor and I think I’m going to apply to the Seminary for next Fall.”\nDiscernment is the prayerful consideration that one undertakes when confronted with an important life decision. It is not necessary, for example, to discern whether one goes for Italian or Chinese food tonight for dinner. You may do a Google Search to see which restaurant has the better rating or you may ask your spouse which one they prefer, but ultimately a decision is made. There is no need to invoke the Holy Spirit about your dining location of preference!\nHowever, when considering important life decisions — whether and whom to marry; whether to accept a new job on the other side of the country; whether to buy a first home — these are decisions that should be accompanied by an appropriate time of discernment. Hopefully such decisions are not made hastily or under duress, seeing as they have important consequences, positive or negative, for one’s life.\nSo, too, when considering a vocation to the priesthood or religious life. This is what we call discerning one’s vocation. And the process of discernment should contain most of the following elements:\n—Deep prayer, continually asking the Holy Spirit to provide you with clarity and peace.\n—Trust in God that He will, in time, reveal His will for you.\n—The desire to serve God and His Church for life in this specific vocation.\n—Speaking to your parents, family and friends (as is appropriate, depending on your family circumstances).\n—Educating and informing yourself about the life of the seminary or convent, about the apostolates and charisms of the diocese or religious order.\n—Speaking to a diocesan vocation director or religious vocation director; attending relevant vocations events, including Come & See retreats and discernment groups.\n—Being patient with God and with yourself as the discernment process runs its course, always docile the promptings of the Holy Spirit and to the decisions of the appropriate Ecclesiastical authorities, that is, of the diocese or particular religious order.\nYour process of discernment should also contain the following questions:\n—What is your motivation for embracing this vocation? Selfless service? Pride and vainglory?\n—Is this vocation something that brings you feelings of joy, peace and fulfillment?\n—Have you consulted trusted spiritual guides — a spiritual director, trusted priests and religious that you know, other members of the parish who know you well?\n—Have you prayerfully considered if a life of chaste and celibate living, in addition to a simple lifestyle, is for you?\n—Are you ready for a life of joyful sacrifice for the building up of God’s Kingdom as a priest or religious?\nThe need for constant discernment\nThis process of prayerful discernment does not end with one’s acceptance into the seminary or convent. While the content of the discernment will certainly change over time, the need for constant discernment does not change. Why?\nFor the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, as we have shared in previous articles in this series, the formation program in the seminary lasts from seven to nine years. Each seminarian must continue to discern his call to the priesthood throughout each phase of seminary formation. The 4 Pillars of Priestly Formation — Human, Intellectual, Spiritual and Pastoral — seek to integrate each of these essential areas of formation as the seminarian advances toward ordination.\nTogether with the guidance and support of his spiritual director and formation advisor, the seminarian ought to be growing and maturing in each of the 4 Pillars of Formation, while at the same time continuing to perceive the call of God within his heart that this indeed is still his true vocation.\nIt will happen at times that a seminarian will come to the prayerful conclusion, having consulted his spiritual director and formation advisor, that he is requesting a leave of absence (for a determined period of time) or withdrawal from seminary formation. Ideally this has been a well-discerned decision, taking into account both the objective and subject factors that have led the seminarian to this decision.\nAt the same time, each seminarian undergoes an Annual Review. The Annual Review process includes consultations and evaluations by the seminary faculty and peer reviews to determine his suitability for advancing to the next year of seminary formation.\nIt also happens at times that this Annual Review process, which includes the active participation of each individual seminarian in his own Annual Review, results in the seminary faculty’s determination that the seminarian should take a leave of absence or withdrawal from the seminary formation program. Such a decision is never the result of a sudden or reactive decision (except in the case of an egregious violation of seminary or archdiocesan policies). Rather, the seminarian will have been well aware of both his strengths and areas of growth.\nThus, significant areas of concern that have arisen in previous Annual Reviews and that have not be addressed satisfactorily may warrant such a dismissal from Seminary Formation. The Annual Review process takes place with transparency and in the fairest manner possible.\nThus, the process of discernment always takes places within in an Ecclesiastical context. Each person must prayerfully discern his own vocation and the signs that point to an authentic call from God. This decision must be made freely, without any outside pressure or duress.\nAt the same time, the Church also discerns — according to the precepts of Pastoris Dabo Vobis and the Program for Priestly Formation, 5th Edition — whether each candidate or seminarian ought to begin or continue in his seminary formation toward ordination as a priest.\nAnd lest one think that discernment ends with one’s priestly ordination or perpetual vows as a religious, the process of discernment, constitutive as it is of the Christian life, continues throughout one’s life and ministry.\nDiocesan priests make a promise of respect and obedience to their bishop. Religious sisters, brothers and priests make a vow of obedience to their religious superior. Just as the bishop or religious superior continually discerns God’s will for the welfare of their diocese or religious congregation, so too does each priest and religious continually discern how they will live out their ordination or religious vows faithfully, joyfully, and according to God’s will and for the building up of God’s Kingdom among them.\nMay the Holy Spirit continue to enlighten the hearts and minds for all men and women in discernment, each seminarian and religious in formation in the seminary or convent, and all priests and fully professed religious sisters, brothers, and priests as they serve God’s people in the Church.\nMay the Blessed Virgin Mary, to whom they are all consecrated to in special way, guide and protect them always.\nBY REV.

50	I'm doing research on galaxy classification and dark matter distribution. How do the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51) and NGC 1052-DF4 differ in terms of their dark matter content and structural characteristics?	The Whirlpool Galaxy (M51) and NGC 1052-DF4 represent dramatically different galaxy types in terms of their dark matter content and structure. M51 is a face-on spiral galaxy with well-defined spiral arms and a companion dwarf galaxy NGC 5195, spanning 81,000 light-years across and located 25 million light-years away. In contrast, NGC 1052-DF4 is an ultra-diffuse galaxy located about 65.2 million light-years away, with the remarkable characteristic of being almost devoid of dark matter - containing only a few percent at most of the dark matter typically found in galaxies. This is highly unusual since dark matter normally constitutes 85% of all gravitating mass in the universe. The two galaxies also differ structurally - while M51 has clear spiral arms, DF4 is more diffuse with relatively few stars spread over a large volume.	['Are galaxies different from each other? Yes. They are as various as snowflakes. Consider this beautiful collection of just nine galaxies from NASA’s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer mission, aka WISE. Notice some galaxies’ round centers, and others’ elongated central bars. Notice we see some straight on, and others at an angle. In the image below, the infrared light collected in the WISE mission has been translated into visible colors. The shortest wavelengths are blue and the longest are red. The oldest stars appear blue, while pockets of newly formed stars have yellow or reddish hues. Meet these nine galaxies individually after the jump. The WISE mission – which was launched in December 2009 – has scanned the whole sky in infrared light. Check out this story about the complete WISE catalog, released in March, 2012.\nThe Whirpool Galaxy, or Messier 51 (M51)\nM51 is well known to amateur astronomers as a face-on spiral with a smaller companion, a dwarf galaxy called NGC 5195. Both can be seen through amateur telescopes. The companion is thought to have helped define and shape M51’s spiral arms. M51 is located 25 million light-years away in the direction of the constellation Canes Venatici. It is 81,000 light-years across, in contrast to an estimated 100,000 light-years for the distance across our home galaxy, the Milky Way.\nMessier 81 (M81)\nM81 is another galaxy well known to those who gaze skyward with telescopes. Its pronounced arms spiral into its core. WISE highlights areas where gas and dust have been compressed in the arms, leading to the formation of new stars. M81 is 12 million light-years away in the direction of the constellation Ursa Major, and 94,000 light-years across.\nSouthern Pinwheel Galaxy, or Messier 83 (M83)\nM83 is s a bit more than half the size of our Milky Way: 55,500 light-years across. Its overall structure is the Milky Way, with most of M83’s stars, dust, and gas in a flat disk ornamented by winding spiral arms. This galaxy is classified as a barred spiral because, in addition to a central bulge of stars, it has a central bar-shaped region of stars. It is 15 million light-years away in the direction of the constellation Hydra.\nNGC 628, or Messier 74 (M74)\nM74 has been called the perfect spiral for its exceptional symmetry. It’s also known for the lightweight black hole at its core. Most galaxies, including our Milky Way, have supermassive black holes at their cores – millions of solar masses collected in a small area – but the black hole in the center of M74 is thought to have a mass equal to only 10,000 suns. M74 is located between 24.5 and 36 million light-years away in the direction of the constellation Pisces, and is 100,000 light-years across.\nNGC 1398 is a barred spiral with a dense inner ring that surrounds a bright, central core. The ring is actually two spiral arms that are closed in on each other. In contrast to its well-defined center, this galaxy’s arms are patchy, or flocculent. It is inclined about 43 degrees away from an edge-on orientation, and has a diameter of 135,000 light-years. NGC 1398 is 65 million light-years away in the direction of the constellation Fornax.\nNGC 2403 is another flocculent, or patchy, spiral. It looks fuzzy in this image, and, indeed, this galaxy is veiled by gas and dust at visible-light wavelengths. But – because it sees in the infrared – WISE was able to reveal its spiral arms. In 2004, NGC 2403 was host to one of the largest supernova in recent decades — SN 2004dj was first observed in 2004 in Japan and was visible for 8 months. NGC 2403 is located 11.4 million-light years away in the direction of the constellation Camelopardalis, and is about 73,000 light-years across.\nSplinter or Knife Edge Galaxy, or NGC 5907\nNGC 5907’s face is angled at about 90 degrees from our view, so it appears edge-on and thin as a splinter, or knife. The faint green hue seen in the WISE composite is due to the halo of old stars that encircles the central region of the galaxy. The Splinter Galaxy is about 53 million light-years away in the directio of the constellation Draco, and is nearly 200,000 light-years across.\nBarnard’s Galaxy, or IC 4895 or NGC 6822\nBarnard’s Galaxy has only about one percent of the mass of the Milky Way. The galaxy’s irregular shape is dominated by a central bar of stars, whose appearance resembles that of the nearby satellite galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud. The prominent yellow blobs seen against the blue stellar background are sites of recent star formation. Barnard’s Galaxy is 1.6 million light-years away in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, and is only about 7,000 light-years across.\nHidden Galaxy, or IC342\nIC342 is difficult to see because it is behind our own Milky Way galaxy. WISE’s infrared vision reveals it, though. This galaxy’s nucleus, or core, is very bright at infrared wavelengths, due to a burst of new stars forming there. IC342 is located about 10 million light-years away in the direction of the constellation Camelopardalis, and is 62,000 light-years across.\nBottom line: The galaxies in our universe come in several basic types, but otherwise they are as different from each other as snowflakes. This post has photos and descriptions of nine different galaxies, from NASA’s Wise mission. The mission released its whole-sky catalog in spring 2012.', '#astronomy New Distances Help Concept of Darkish Matter–much less Galaxies – Sky & Telescope\nNew distance measurements of two unusual galaxies within the constellation Cetus, the Whale, assist the notion that they’re nearly devoid of darkish matter — the mysterious stuff that constitutes 85% of all gravitating mass within the universe. Astronomers are at a loss to clarify the obvious absence of darkish matter within the two methods. A\nNew distance measurements of two unusual galaxies within the constellation Cetus, the Whale, assist the notion that they’re nearly devoid of darkish matter — the mysterious stuff that constitutes 85% of all gravitating mass within the universe. Astronomers are at a loss to clarify the obvious absence of darkish matter within the two methods.\nA survey picture taken with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array exhibits objects inside the area of the elliptical galaxy NGC 1052 (middle). Amongst these objects are DF2 (backside left) and DF4 (high proper); each are darkish matter-deficient galaxies which might be related in dimension, luminosity, morphology, globular cluster inhabitants, and velocity dispersion.\nP. van Dokkum (Yale College) / STScI / ACS\nNGC 1052-DF2 and -DF4 (named after the Dragonfly Telephoto Array in New Mexico that imaged the objects) are prime examples of ultra-diffuse galaxies. They include comparatively few stars unfold out over a big quantity, making them exhausting to detect. On the sky, the 2 faint smudges are near NGC 1052, the biggest member of a small galaxy group between 63 and 70 million light-years away.\nIf DF2 and DF4 are at an analogous distance, measurements of the speed unfold of their member stars and orbiting globular clusters point out complete galaxy lots which might be in good settlement with the noticed variety of stars. This implies that their darkish matter fraction is a couple of % at most, an oddity in comparison with most galaxies whose complete mass is dominated by darkish matter. One other puzzling factor is that the globular clusters of the 2 ultra-diffuse galaxies are exceptionally luminous.\nThe preliminary findings by the Dragonfly group, printed in 2018 and 2019, have been challenged by Ignacio Trujillo (Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands) and his colleagues. They argued that the 2 galaxies are a lot nearer, about 42 million light-years away, primarily based on archival observations of the constituent stars. In that case, there can be “loads of room for darkish matter”, the researchers wrote, and the globular clusters would have a standard luminosity.\nThe brand new Hubble Area Telescope picture of NGC 1052-DF2\nZ. Shen et al. / arXiv\nNonetheless, new, devoted Hubble Area Telescope observations of DF2 and DF4 now appear to assist the unique claims made by the Dragonfly group. Hubble imaged many 1000’s of particular person crimson large stars within the outer elements of each galaxies. The brightest crimson large stars in any galaxy have a well-defined luminosity, so measuring the obvious brightness of this “tip of the crimson large department” (TRGB) supplies an estimate of the celebrities’ distance.\nShany Danieli (Yale College) and her colleagues printed preliminary outcomes for DF4 final yr in Astrophysical Journal Letters. A group led by Zili Chen (additionally at Yale) posted a lot deeper observations of DF2 April ninth on the arXiv preprint server. The TRGB measurements point out a distance of 65.2 million gentle years for DF4 and 72.zero million light-years for DF2. The researchers describe the space as “definitive.”\nThis zoom in on DF2 exhibits resolved crimson large stars in a background of unresolved blue stars.\nZ. Shen et al. / arXiv\nNonetheless, Trujillo isn’t but satisfied. Particularly, he notes that Danieli, Chen, and their colleagues have omitted the innermost elements of the 2 galaxies of their evaluation. “These areas include 50% of the celebrities,” he says. “They need to not have been thrown away so simply.” Trujillo additionally fears that the group’s evaluation has misidentified the true tip of the crimson large department.\nFurthermore, Trujillo’s group has claimed the invention of tidal streams of stars streaming away from DF4, suggesting gravitational interactions with one other galaxy, NGC 1035, which is a few 45 million light-years away.\nIf the bigger distances for the 2 ultra-diffuse galaxies stand the take a look at of time, astronomers should clarify how a galaxy can lose nearly all of its darkish matter. The rate measurements of DF2 and DF4 would even doubtlessly pose an issue for MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics), which tries to clarify away darkish matter by introducing an alternate description of gravity. If MOND is appropriate, each galaxy ought to behave as if it contained a great deal of darkish matter.\nMOND theorists notice that the “MONDian” gravitational area of NGC 1052 would have an effect on the dynamics of close by DF2 in kind of the proper manner as to clarify the speed measurements. Nonetheless, that leaves DF4 unexplained: The brand new Hubble observations point out that DF2 and DF4 are fairly far other than one another, to allow them to’t each lie within the bigger galaxy’s sphere of affect.\nThe 2 latest papers “are a helpful addition to the space dialogue utilizing deeper knowledge,” says Trujillo’s colleague Michael Beasley. “Nonetheless, I’m positive that they don’t seem to be the final phrase on the matter.” It might take future observations by the James Webb Area Telescope to settle the difficulty as soon as and for all.']	['<urn:uuid:b9409d42-7f28-49d3-b0aa-2ddca6aeedd0>', '<urn:uuid:195a8582-7f64-441e-a5af-4f75faca4163>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	30	132	1796
51	I heard that diamonds can be recycled from old jewelry. What happens to diamonds from old rings that can't be fixed up anymore?	When a ring is too used to be refurbished, the gold gets recycled and the diamond is removed to be re-purposed. Diamond dealers buy such diamonds from people who no longer need them, and then typically sell these large certified diamonds to wholesale diamond dealers.	['Diamond Business Value Added Chain\nDiamonds become marketable, and are sold, as a result of a value added chain created to satisfy end users’ needs. This is how it works.\nThere are four main participants in a diamond transaction. Learn more.\n- End User\n- Jewelry Retailer\n- Diamond Dealer\n- Diamond Wholesale Dealer\nThe value added chain is the results of the actions of the participants in the diamond sales process. Each participant contributes an important share in what it takes to bring a diamond into the market. Contributing to a business process such that an item, or service, becomes possible, or more desirable, is known as “adding value”. Thus, diamonds enter the market as a result of a “value added chain”.\nTo best explain how the diamond business value added chain works, I will use a simplified example. Illustrating through an example all that that it takes to make possible a diamond sale is the easiest way to explain the diamond business value added process.\nExample Diamond Sale Transaction\nA couple decides to get married. This is the seminal event of most diamond sale transactions\nThe husband decides that, to seal the deal, he will buy the best possible engagement ring that he can afford. Traditionally, engagement rings feature a prominent diamond.\nHe goes to a few jewelry stores (retail jewelers), and locates quite a few diamond rings that would better than do the job for him. At this point, the retail jewelers that engage with him are creating value buy helping the customer select a ring, or possibly getting custom ring designed and built.\nThe retail jeweler and the customer, decide that none of the existing engagement rings would be unique enough for lady. She wants something fancy and unique, with a large awesome diamond. So the retail jeweler and the customer, conclude that it would be best to create a custom engagement ring with a big, nice, certified diamond. The ring will be created from scratch. The diamond will be sourced.\nBecause large certified diamonds are so expensive, the retail jeweler can’t hold too many of them. In fact, he retail jeweler has no very large certified diamonds on stock. To source the diamond, he will work with a wholesale diamond dealer.\nThe wholesale diamond dealer is the business of keeping in inventory a great selection of certified diamonds. He happens to have a certified diamond that closely matches the specifications of the retail jeweler. Since diamonds are a natural product, this is as good as it will get. No two diamonds are the same.\nThe way the wholesale diamond dealer got the needed diamond is by steadily working with a diamond dealer. He has several similar business relationships throughout the country, and even some abroad. That is how he gets his diamond inventory for the most part.\nThe diamond dealer, in turn got the needed diamond from a lady that no longer needed it. So she sold it to the diamond dealer for cash. She had the diamond, mounted on a engagement ring, for a long time. The ring was used enough that it was not possible to refurbish. So the gold got recycled, and the diamond was removed for the it to be re-purposed.\nThe diamond dealer is in the business of buying and selling diamonds and diamond jewelry, mostly by dealing with the public. For him, the best way to deal with a large certified diamond, is to sell it to a wholesale diamond dealer.\nThe Value Added Chain\nAs you can see, each participant in the value added chain contributed time, expertise and capital in order to make it possible for the groom to present a diamond to the bride, “seal the deal”, and get married. In exchange for their effort, each participant earns a profit commensurate with their contribution to the diamond sale transaction.']	['<urn:uuid:1e7df6c4-d3a1-4f12-8b83-bb08a1ca284d>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	23	45	643
52	What challenges do women face in accessing education and recognition in both the East African art world and Nigerian farming communities?	In both contexts, women have historically faced significant barriers. In East African art, Rosemary Karuga was notably the first woman to attend the prestigious Makerere University School of Fine Arts, and Theresa Musoke was one of the first women to obtain a degree from Makerere University at a time when very few African women were attending University. In Nigerian farming communities, women face similar educational barriers, as many extension programs are directed to men and women are not as accepted. Additionally, women farmers struggle to obtain credit and secure access to land, as men are most often the landowners in the family. This is particularly problematic for widowed women who often cannot inherit the land, despite women being the majority of those who work the land and produce the crops.	['National Museums of Kenya and The Murumbi Trust present an exhibition of artworks by nine acclaimed women of East Africa, titled “Pioneer Women of the Arts.” The opening ceremony will take place on Sunday, September 9 at 2:00pm, at the Nairobi Gallery in Nairobi, Kenya.\nThe exhibition will highlight works from legendary East African artists Margaret Trowell, Joy Adamson, Magdalene Odundo, Rosemary Karuga, Geraldine Robarts, Robin Anderson, Yony Wai-Te, Nani Croze, and Theresa Musoke, and will be open through December 8, 2018. AMB. Amina C Mohamed, EGH, Cabinet Secretary for Education will lead the ceremony.\nThe exhibition’s entertainment will be a performance by PAPILLON, a young Kenyan musician and protégé of the world-famous Kenyan musician Ayub Ogada.\nPAPILLON creates his own instruments based on African instruments thousands of years old and writes his own music in an effort to preserve authentic Kenyan music not influenced by Western rap and hip hop. PAPILLON follows in the footsteps of Kenya’s African Heritage Festival, founded by Alan Donovan, which travels the world with its cast of models, musicians, acrobats, stilt walkers, hair dressers, chefs and others.\nEach artist showcased in “Pioneer Women of the Arts” was selected based on the various paths that have paved their existence in the art realm, and their earned acclaim through their unique struggle. These female artists have generated a significant impact on the art and culture of East Africa.\nTrowell, with her six books and art school at the prestigious Makerere University in Uganda, which was the best in the region – and perhaps all of Africa, is undoubtedly an influential pioneer artist and teacher to whom all artists in East Africa owe a debt. Her main goal in creating art, Trowell said, was to “make it plain that art is of the people and natural to the people.”\nAdamson, conceivably best known for her children’s books and later TV series “Born Free,” has also had a tremendous impact on the preservation of African culture. Throughout her travels, Adamson realized that she must paint the people of Kenya in their many tribal dresses before they were abandoned for Western wear and imports. She spent six and a half years living in all parts of Kenya during this pursuit after the Kenyan Government commissioned her to make a comprehensive record of all the traditional dress and ornaments of the people of Kenya.\nOdundo holds the highest position in international arts of any East African, as Chancellor of the University of Creative Arts in the UK. She has received an OBE by the Queen of England for her service to the arts, and has achieved international acclaim for her ceramic and glass works, which have been collected in museums globally. Odundo is known for being one of the world’s greatest contemporary potters.\nKaruga was the first woman to attend the prestigious Makerere University School of Fine Arts. She has exhibited her works with the leading artists of the continent and has been a mentor to world-renowned ceramicist Magdalene Odundo. Karuga pioneered a unique form of collage using local materials, and was eventually given a Lifetime Achievement Award for her contributions to the art world.\nRobarts has lifelong experience as a painter and University Lecturer in Fine Arts, including Makerere University and Kenyatta University. She is always pushing the boundaries of what paint, color, and new materials can achieve, and loves exploring the world to bring her inimitable style to her creations. Robarts is also a prominent worker with grassroots women’s groups in Kenya and has worked to bring art, health, and economic opportunities to communities who had previously struggled to survive.\nAnderson has made a lasting impact on the art world of East Africa, perhaps most famously as the co-founder of the leading East African contemporary art gallery, Gallery Watatu, which served as a platform for serious contemporary art in East Africa with recurrent exhibitions by leading artists. Inspired by the people and wildlife of Kenya, Anderson was a forerunner for what became a burgeoning industry of batiks in South Africa with her elegant batiks on silk.\nWai-Te is most famous for co-founding the first major contemporary art gallery in East Africa, Gallery Watatu, which has become the leading contemporary art gallery in the region. Her wildebeest and wildlife paintings populate hotels and public buildings throughout East Africa and have gained her an international following and reputation synonymous with the safari style of the region. Through her Wildebeests Workshops, Wai-Te has worked and trained many East African women’s groups and artists.\nCroze, as an artist, educator, and environmentalist, has brought another dimension to the art of East Africa. Founder of the Kitengela Glass Research and Training Trust, a center for recycling used glass into art, Croze has conducted numerous glass training workshops for young women from Kibera slums creating glass beads, pottery, and mosaics. Her monumental stained-glass and recycled glass works appear in numerous public spaces, including the courtyard and entry of the National Museums of Kenya.\nMusoke was one of the first women to obtain a degree from Makerere University at a time when very few African women were attending University. Her distinctive works romanticizing wildlife in a moody mixture of abstract batik and oil paintings have won Musoke great acclaim. She also taught art at Makerere and other leading art institutions in East Africa.', 'To celebrate the International Day of Rural Women, we interviewed Monica Maigari, a Nigerian farmer who has been named a “Female Food Hero” by Oxfam. Monica spoke at the session “Food Security in Crisis” at the Borlaug Dialogue in Iowa.\nFF: How did you begin your career as a farmer?\nMM: I was first introduced to farming as an elementary student. The teachers would take us to the countryside in the evening where we would work in the gardens and learn about farming. I took an interest and learned much. After marriage, my husband and I as teachers made little money. So I began farming to supplement our income.\nFF: What are the challenges farmers face in your region?\nMM: In our region, one of the main difficulties is access to the equipment that can make our agriculture less labour intensive. In addition, reliable access to improved seeds and inputs can be a real challenge. Finally, for women, the right to inherit and have title to land is difficult.\nFF: Is climate change affecting your region?\nMM: Yes. The main difference is in the timing and duration of the annual rainy season. One year the rains may come late; the next year they may be very early. For example, farmers in my region of Kaduna state usually plant rice in July to coincide with the annual rains. However, this year the rains came early and our rice harvest will be very small.\nFF: How have you overcome these challenges?\nMM: I have sought out education and worked to develop test plots that not only help me to try new techniques and seeds, but also help other women to learn more modern practices of farming – in seed spacing, rotation with legumes, and moisture retention.\nFF: Do you think women face more difficulties than male farmers?\nMM: Yes. Women especially have difficulty in have secure access to land. Men are most often the landowners in the family, so if a woman is widowed she often cannot inherit the land. And yet, women are the majority of those that work the land and produce the crops, but often have the least ability to obtain credit. In addition, many extension programs are directed to men, and women are not as accepted.\nFF: How have you overcome these difficulties?\nMM: Like other Female Food Heroes, I have worked to form women’s groups where we share knowledge, and create opportunities for work and added value in our crops. Women mentoring and working with other women is a powerful tool.\nFF: How did you get involved in the Female Food Hero Competition?\nMM: A local organization came to my community with an application for the Nigeria Ogbonge Woman completion sponsored in part by Oxfam. I applied and out of over 1,200 women, I was one of twelve finalists. I then went on to take a 2nd position. Using the proceeds from that initiative, I was able to purchase the land I farmed, work as an advocate for small-scale women farmers in my region and also in other countries like Ethiopia and the U.S.\nFF: How did it feel to win the competition?\nMM: At first I had no words. I was the only woman winner from my state of Kaduna. I am happy that my winning is allowing me to help other women farmers, and advocate for the rights to land and the need to address climate change.\nFF: What are your hopes for the future of your farm?\nMM: I hope that I can continue to improve and add value to my farm, so that as I get older I will be able to sell it to another farmer and be able to use that money to benefit other women, my community, and the world.\nFF: What is your message to other female farmers on International Day of Rural Women?\nMM: My message is that women must join together to build a better food system, and to advocate for our rights to land, tools, and education.']	['<urn:uuid:43a32c84-d4b0-414f-8c07-60828bdb127b>', '<urn:uuid:5a391212-203e-43fd-8fe2-32200750b3ab>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	21	130	1558

Personal Data may define race/ethnic origin, religious beliefs, political views, sexual orientation, and health conditions, and may demand more strict regulatory requirements. In some situations, consumers provide personal information for free. In others – data is found by giving consumer’s search history, location data, or buyer’s profile. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will drive inferred data.\nData on its own may not stand out as personal data, but when combined with other data it may be private if it identifies information about an individual. The ability to de-anonymise data has increased due to numerous facts. Marketers have become too liberal in the collection of consumer data. It describes radioactive data like customer data, e.g., personally identifiable, which could violate a business agreement if lost. There are about 15 data types, 6 of them are considered radioactive and 7 are considered toxic.\nWhat are the Purposes of Data Collection?\nThere are eight purposes of data collection.\nOne reason for collecting user data is providing the ability to deliver more targeted advertising, based on consumer’s features and demographics. Programmatic advertising became a result of buyer’s tracking. The rise of cookie leaking/syncing enhances the ability to target. According to a report, 5% digital marketers of 83% consider that people-based campaigns perform better than cookie-based.\nPersonalise and improve products/services\nUser’s Data is utilised by site hosts to improve website performance, as well as to personalise content and products, offering to individual consumers.\nAnalysis of data is used to detect fraud and to identify suspicious activity. Both fraud and the incidence of “false positives,’’ i.e., the rejection of a valid transaction can be a significant problem for financial institutions and merchants. Allowing a fraudulent transaction can require the merchant financially, but it can cost the financial institution as well, depending on the nature of an operation. Machine learning improves fraud detection as well as reduces the incidence of false positives.\nBusiness Efficiencies and Processes\nBy retaining customer data, an online retailer can pre-fill forms, e.g., delivery and card details. Data can also be used to decide what products to stock by location.\nThe remaining four reasons relate to a combination of data selling, leakage, sharing, and discrimination.\nSeveral companies sell anonymised data to other parties, e.g., telecom companies may sell data for geolocation tracking, and credit card companies sell these data to advertising companies. First-party data may also give their data to other parties to complete transactions, conduct surveys, and prevent fraud/for security, or marketing.\nHow are consumers tracked online?\nThere are many data trails that we leave as consumers, online and offline. They rise as the use of technology becomes more established in everyday life. Technological progress has resulted in a significant increase in online tracking.\nCookies are the most spreading way of tracking/collecting data which usually contain a string of text as a “unique identifier.” Storing relevant details about a user’s interaction with a site and preferences in this way helps facilitate a more user-friendly experience. When a member returns to a particular website, cookies allow the website to recognise a user’s web browser and remember information about him.\nThere are different types of cookies:\n- Session cookies: Enable websites to link the actions of a user during the browser session\n- Persistent cookies: Allow to check user information and settings/preferences\n- First- and third-party cookies: Refer to the website or domain placing the cookie\nIt is usually the persistent, third-party and tracking cookies which are of most concern from a privacy perspective. These cookies are hard to delete and they have expiration dates that can extend with the website.\nFlash cookies have also become popular. This information can be kept on a computer which is designed to save data, e.g., scores on games. It is difficult to delete them in the same way as other cookies, which means some companies use them to reload other cookies back onto a computer.\nWe can also distinguish ‘Super Cookie’ and ‘Zombie Cookie.’ A super cookie is designed to be permanently stored on a user’s computer and is harder to find out and remove than regular cookies. A Zombie Cookie is projected to return to life after being deleted.\nThere are some newly developed forms of tracking:\nFingerprinting involves collecting unique identifying patterns of information to define a specific device or application. It often consists of gathering unique identifying patterns of information\n- Web Beacons / Pixel Tags are small objects embedded into a webpage or email which are not visible to the user. When a page with one of these objects loads, it will make a call to the server for the object, and this allows the company to know that someone has loaded the page\n- Mobile Tracking\nA new age of connectivity has influenced on such openings.\nThere are several ways of consumer’s mobile tracking:\n- Advertising ID: Apps downloaded on a phone show advertising based on advertising IDs. These include Apple’s Advertising Identifier (IDFA), Android’s Advertising ID and Facebook App User IDs\n- Wi-Fi: When a phone is linked up to a Wi-Fi network, sensors can use the phones media access control (MAC) address to track movement, e.g., around a store\n- Carrier: The mobile carriers may provide de-identified data to third parties for advertising and other purposes\n- GPS: Geolocation tracking (via GPS satellites), e.g., if you pass a particular restaurant on a regular basis, the restaurant could use the information to offer a coupon\n- iBeacons/Antennas: Small wireless devices that use radio signals to communicate with mobiles/tablets\n- Facial Recognition uses biometric software which identifies individuals in a digital image\n- Cross-Device Tracking pulls together disparate datasets to create a picture of consumer behavior/usage as device proliferation has increased\nData protection is not only a dynamic space in Europe. Technological trends are driving changes on a global scale. The implication has been growth, and rising heterogeneity, in the data protection landscape.\nThe United States has taken a more principle and sector-specific based approach than the European Union. U.S. regulators have been willing to work collaboratively with industry operators, encouraging self-regulation. Legislation has been used to address specific risks.\nFair Practice Principles\nModern Data Protection in the United States remains based on traditions stemming from ‘fair practice’ principles first enunciated in 1973.\nCalifornia Has Been the Pioneer at a State Level\nSome states have led the way in privacy regulation, pushing ahead of the Federal Government.\nIn some cases, state provisions can converge to a considerable degree. For example, a notification requirement exists in 47 U.S. States as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Despite this, there are significant divergences in areas where states have specific concentrations regarding industry exposure, such as New York for financial services.\nIndustry-Specific Approaches; From Self-Regulation to Legislation\nThere is sector-specific legislation that includes requirements around Data Protection. The framework applies to all businesses that use consumer data.\nThe framework has three key components:\n- Privacy by Design\n- Simplified Consumer Choice\nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Privacy Approach Economically Driven\nAPEC’s aims in the area of data protection are exclusively economic. The framework builds public confidence in the safety and security of data flows and to realise the potential of electronic commerce. It is a contrast to Europe where the critical aims of data protection revolve around the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.\nWhat are the Main Issues for Corporates and Investors in Data Protection?\n- Although the opportunities from data are significant, a lot of speakers have underplayed and underestimated the challenges associated with ensuring ePrivacy and adequately protecting personal data.\n- The implementation of the GDPR in May 2018 represents one of the most excellent events in ePrivacy/data protection regulatory history. The regulation is a game changer regarding not only its scope and ambition but also the significant penalties for non-compliance.\n- The purpose of the developing data protection regulation in Europe is the transferring power to consumers, and in the end, the increase of transparency and trust in how companies use consumer’s data. Best case, consumers become more trusting. The outcome being that data quality improves, and data as an asset increases in value.\n- The very same companies that the GDPR was potentially designed to constrain will probably end up being least affected. Of course, there will be increased regulatory costs associated with compliance, but those larger companies that already have consumer trust and the necessary resources to remain compliant with much stricter and more complex EU rules will likely be less disrupted than smaller enterprises. For all companies, it will probably require a cultural change.\n- The asymmetric approach toward regulation between different regions could lead to a similar level of asymmetry regarding access to investment and 21st century consumer services – artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things.\nIt is in the interests of companies to provide comprehensive data privacy assurances. The World Economic Forum estimates that capturing the share of data privacy-conscious consumers should put about $330 billion at stake in 2015-25. The number of buyers moving to companies with strong data privacy measures is estimated to grow from 5% in 2015 to 25% in 2025.\n- Personal data is any information relating to an identified or a living person\n- The purposes of data collection are diverse\n- Cookies are the most spreading way of tracking/collecting data\n- There are five key issues for Corporates and Investors in Data Protection']	['<urn:uuid:e59bdae4-c321-4b21-a2b5-e2bd89a688e0>', '<urn:uuid:412b27f0-b14c-48dc-95fc-1e76dc3de4eb>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	6	74	2147
54	I'm researching marine climate records, and I'd like to know how coral cores are used to study both historic ocean conditions and current topographical effects - what dating methods are used for coral analysis, and how do they help understand island-induced mixing patterns?	Coral cores are dated through two main methods: counting annual density bands via medical scanner/x-ray analysis, and using radioactive isotope decay dating. These techniques help establish growth patterns over the past 200 years or more. Regarding mixing patterns, observations near islands show systematic distortions of isotherms close to the island and intensive mixing particularly on northern coasts. This mixing is most pronounced on north slopes during west-east currents, where Richardson numbers reach minimum values and flow separation from boundaries is most likely to occur.	"['The influence of topography on steady currents and internal waves\nHogg, Nelson G.\nMetadataShow full item record\nKeywordOcean waves; Gravity waves; Ocean currents; Submarine topography; Atlantis II (Ship : 1963-) Cruise AII47; Gosnold (Ship : 1962-1973) Cruise 144\nObservations of the ocean in the vicinity of Bermuda on two different occasions show systematic distortions of the isotherms close to the island and an area of intensive mixing on the northern coast. Two mechanisms are investigated and each produces some agreement with data from different flow regimes. Firstly, the island is modeled as a circularly symmetric obstacle with steep sides and a small aspect ratio. A steady, rotating, and stratified flow which, far from the island, is uniform in the horizontal and a linear function of the vertical coordinate is taken to be flowing past the island. Neglecting circulation effects, the problem is solved to first order in a small parameter, α, which measures the steepness of the island and a small Rossby number, ε. This allows a calculation of the depth contours of isotherms to 0(ε2,εα). For one set of data the flow is such that the slope effect of 0(εα) predominates while for another period of observation both slope and Rossby number influences are of the same magnitude. In both cases qualitative agreement between fact and theory is remarkably good. In addition, it is shown that the north slope (for a west-east current) is the most favored area for mixing as there the Richardson number is a minimum and the flow is most likely to separate from the boundary. A second means of producing isotherm distortion and mixing areas close to the island concerns the nonlinear effects of shoaling internal gravity waves. For normal incidence on a two-dimensional beach the Reynolds stresses produced by the fundamental wave motion are shown to force a mean Eulerian current which is equal hut opposite in sense to the Stokes drift. This causes the mean Lagrangian current to vanish so that the physical constraint that there be no net motion of fluid particles along isopycnals into the beach is satisfied. In addition, isotherms are distorted in a fashion analogous to the surface set-down produced by shoaling surface waves. The mean isopycnal shift can be as much as 10m where the theory has some validity. Distortions of the predicted form are observed in the data from a period when the mean currents were small. Consideration of the oblique incidence problem shows that this generalization has little effect on the expected magnitude of the shifts but that a significant longshore current can be forced by the breaking of the waves.\nSubmitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution January, 1971\nSuggested CitationThesis: Hogg, Nelson G., ""The influence of topography on steady currents and internal waves"", 1971-01, DOI:10.1575/1912/1268, https://hdl.handle.net/1912/1268\nShowing items related by title, author, creator and subject.\nPankratov, Kirill K.

Back at home base — the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences (LSCE) on the Paris-Saclay campus — Eric is studying the core samples of coral collected in the Pacific Ocean since the beginning of the expedition. Interview with a geochemist.\nCan you tell us more about your mission with Tara Pacific?\nIn collaboration with the Scientific Center of Monaco (MSC), I proposed to set up precise pH measurements of surface seawater from the schooner by installing on board a UV-Vis spectrophotometer with fiber optics. The pH is the key indicator of ocean acidification resulting from the ongoing absorption into the sea of carbon dioxide massively released into the atmosphere by human activities. We study this parameter to characterize and quantify the current acidification of water masses and better assess its impact on the life of corals.\nYou have received all the coral cores collected during Tara’s expeditions.\nI lead a research team at the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences (LSCE). We carry out work in both geochronology and geochemistry. In geochronology, we develop tools to precisely date climate records or archaeological remains. For example, certain techniques were used during an earlier expedition to date the deep fossil corals collected in the North Atlantic. Currently, we’re using these same tools to confirm the growth pattern of surface coral we sampled in the Pacific Ocean. In a second step, we will develop our work in geochemistry to establish and quantify the evolution over time (especially over the last 100 years) of the temperature and pH of the Pacific Ocean.\nCoral reefs studied by the scientists on board Tara © Eric Rottinger / Tara Expeditions Foundation\nWhat are the established protocols to study these growth models?\nThe first step, before studying the geochemistry of Tara’s coral samples, is to establish an age model, to understand how the drilled and studied colonies developed over time. There are 2 methods to establish the growth rate of coral colonies. The first is simply to track and count the annual density bands after core analysis by medical scanner or x-ray. Each year, the coral forms a particular density band linked to the succession of seasons. If necessary, to confirm the counting of tropical coral growth bands, we use dating methods based on the radioactive decay of certain isotopes.\nHave you started working on the cores taken by the Tara Pacific teams?\nOf the 20 or so cores recently received since the beginning of the expedition, we’ve begun the analysis of about 10 cores of the species Porites. We were able to establish the growth patterns of the concerned colonies while beginning the first geochemical analyses. The first cores taken in the eastern Pacific were a bit short and only covered the last 50 years, but in agreement with the Tara Pacific consortium, we decided to drill a new species of massive coral of the genus Diploastrea heliopora. Since then, we’ve received new cores taken from different sites in the western Pacific, enabling us today to cover the last 200 years or even beyond.\nGroup of polyps in a colony of Diploastrea helioporae © Noëlie Pansiot / Tara Expeditions Foundation\nWhat happens after the dating of the samples?\nAfter establishing the colony growth model, we analyze their geochemistry, in other words the chemical composition of the coral skeleton, which allows us to reconstruct the evolution of the ocean temperature and pH in the past.\nWhat information is provided by these Tara coral samples?\nIt’s too early to tell! But there’s one important thing to do: we have to compare the evolution of the ocean’s characteristics here in relation with the parameters of coral growth and physiology, in other words their capacity to develop and grow over time. This is to study the impact of ongoing global changes on the development of coral reefs in the Pacific. What does stand out from this research is that the major changes in pH and temperature since the beginning of the industrial era have already changed the rate of coral growth.\nToday, all our recordings systematically show a drop in the pH of the oceans over the last 150 years, which corresponds to the industrial era. We note that since the beginning of the industrial era, ocean acidification has accelerated at a rate never seen since 300 million years. And its impact on marine life, which will be more and more pressing in future years, remains unknown.\nOcean acidification and observations – ITW Alexander Venn\nThe oceans absorb a fourth of anthropic CO2 emissions released every day into ...Read more\nTara Oceans: discovery of over 100 million genes from the marine world\nPress release – January 25, 2018 The Tara Oceans expedition (2009-2013) ...Read more\nVideo: Studying coral adaptation to climate change\nA team of researchers from the Monaco Scientific Center, the University of Nice ...Read more']"	['<urn:uuid:5d9fcc0c-96e9-4fdb-acd7-13e42dc524d1>', '<urn:uuid:5ef7139f-8893-493c-9980-0290bbddf700>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	43	84	1450
55	Does gold or real estate require more storage costs?	Both assets have storage-related costs. Real estate has carrying costs and maintenance expenses as part of ownership. Gold bullion also has high storage costs, requiring secure storage in safes or bank safety deposit boxes, though investors can avoid these costs by using gold ETFs instead.	['What Is Liquidity?\nREtipster does not provide tax, investment, or financial advice. Always seek the help of a licensed financial professional before taking action.\nWhat Does Liquidity Mean in Business?\nLiquidity is the ease at which an asset or security can be bought or sold in the market at or near its fair market value. It also refers to the degree to which an asset or security is used in transactions.\nSimply speaking, cash or currency is the most liquid of all assets because it has an objective value and it is a medium commonly used in the exchange of goods and services. Currency has a value that is recognized by all parties that function within that same monetary system.\nAt the same time, certain types of assets do not have this same objective value (such as a house, a car, or jewelry). In order for these assets to be converted to cash and “liquidated,” they must be sold to another party who is willing to pay for the asset’s value. It can take an unpredictable amount of time to find this type of buyer and as such, these assets are not considered liquid.\nIs Real Estate Liquid?\nReal estate is considered to be illiquid (the opposite of liquid) because it does not have an objective value that every buyer will agree with. In normal market conditions, the owner will have to list the property for sale, find the right buyer, negotiate and agree on a price, carry out property inspections, and close on a sale. This entire process may take months, sometimes even years for the seller to receive their sale proceeds.\nIn real estate, it is difficult to predict when and how properties will sell. In some cases, properties may even depreciate in value, and the property owner may have to sell the property at a lower price than when it was purchased.\nDespite the disadvantage of low liquidity, real estate offers other benefits to investors that are not available with any other type of investment. The opportunity to leverage other people’s money (OPM) allows an investor to own, control, and monetize 100% of property while investing a much smaller portion of their own money.\nReal estate also offers significant tax write-offs through depreciation and other maneuvers like the 1031 exchange. Since real estate does not have an objective value, it presents an opportunity for investors to buy properties below market value and adding sweat equity to increase the property’s value, so they can resell for a significant profit in the future. These characteristics can help investors by acting as a hedge against inflation, effectively diversifying their portfolios.\nIn addition, property appreciation and cash flow from rentals are well-known strategies to earn income from real estate. In some markets, investment properties can appreciate by as much as 10%.\nFinally, real estate investment trusts (REITs) are liquid real estate investments. Most REITs are publicly traded and can be bought and sold just like stocks. The disadvantage is that the investor has no physical ownership of the property.\nBY THE NUMBERS: National appreciation values average around 3.5% to 3.8% per year.\nFactors That Determine Real Estate Liquidity\nDifferent factors influence how quickly and easily a property may sell in the market.\nSome properties are more liquid than others. For example, residential properties often sell faster because there are more buyers in the market looking for homes, whereas commercial real estate is much more expensive and there are far fewer buyers in the market for these properties at any given time. Homes (particularly single-family units) also require less due diligence and lower transaction costs. However, the property’s condition is also a big factor; freshly renovated properties are generally more liquid, for instance.\nProperties in a convenient and prime location appeal most to buyers. A rental property located in popular districts with easy access to great schools, public transportation, parks, groceries, and malls sells quickly. Safety, utility, and developer brand recall may also improve the liquidity of a property.\nThe time it takes to close a deal and the overall costs of the transaction also affect the liquidity of the property. This includes the time to finalize the paperwork and all legal obligations and the total costs of the taxes, broker’s fees, registration fees, and other maintenance costs. The smoother and the fewer overhead costs there are, the more liquid the property is.\nFinally, the market dictates the general liquidity of real estate. Like any other investment, there are good and bad times to sell depending on how “hot” the market is. The hotter the market, the more liquid real estate is; the colder the market, the more illiquid. Real estate investors often call a hot market a seller’s market and a cold market a buyer’s market.\nThis table explains the correlation between liquidity and other factors in the market:\n|Hot (Seller’s Market)||Cold (Buyer’s Market)|\n|Price||Higher than listing||Lower than listing|\nIs There Liquidity Risk in Real Estate?\nCertain types of real estate may also suffer from liquidity risk, which describes properties that are more difficult or take longer to sell.\nVarious factors contribute to the liquidity risk of a specific property, such as high carrying costs, undesirable locations, or the general state of the market. If the investor needs to raise the money immediately, they will be forced to sell the property for less than its fair value.\nHowever, there are ways to capitalize on liquidity risk. Investing in a property with a long time horizon may bypass volatility and changes in the market. Doing so may allow the property to be sold later when the investor feels it can sell; for example when the neighborhood is gentrified, or development has begun to ease access to the property.\nInvestors, however, must consider that market conditions will not always be favorable. In some cases, there will be no “favorable” times at all. When the opportunity presents itself, they should take the chance and sell the high-risk property instead of missing the only window they could sell it.\n- Liquidity is the speed and efficiency at which an asset or security can be traded at or near its market value.\n- Cash is the most liquid because it has an objective value and it is the most commonly used medium of exchange.\n- Real estate is highly illiquid. However, real estate has a low or negative correlation with other asset classes, making it a good hedge against inflation due to its appreciation and cash flow potential.\n- Factors that determine the liquidity of a property include location, condition of the property, transaction costs, and the state of the local market. Some properties have inherently high liquidity risk, however.\n- Nicolas, S. (2021.) What Investments Are Considered Liquid Assets? Investopedia.

It can also be an important part of a retirement savings plan.\nInvestors can choose from physical gold coins and bullion, exchange-traded funds that track gold prices or mutual funds that buy shares of precious metal mining companies. All of these options have different costs and levels of risk.\nIt’s a Safe Haven\nGold is often viewed as a safe asset during times of economic uncertainty or market turmoil. It is a “safe” asset because of its many characteristics, such as its limited supply (like precious materials), its relative permanence and its long-lasting utility. As a result, it has held or even increased its value during past market downturns.\nGold’s price is also affected by many factors. Stock market panics, for example, can cause investors to turn to gold as a hedge. The gold price can also be affected by inflation expectations and the pace of inflation. Similarly, rising interest rates can push people to seek shelter in the safety of government bonds and push them away from non-interest-bearing gold.\nRegardless of the reason, most investors choose to invest in gold as a way to diversify their portfolios. It has historically had a lower correlation with traditional financial assets such as stocks and bond. This low correlation can help to reduce a portfolio’s overall risk exposure and potentially improve long-term returns. It’s important to weigh the potential benefits of adding gold to your portfolio against its disadvantages. Be sure to do your homework when choosing a dealer, particularly with unallocated gold (gold that isn’t physically held by a dealer). Many dealers are unscrupulous, and they use tactics such as high-pressure sales to scam their customers.\nIt’s a Diversifier\nIf you plan to invest for the long run, a part of your portfolio should consist of gold. As a diversifier, it protects against a decline in the value of other assets like stocks and bonds. Gold can also help offset a rise in inflation.\nIt can be emotionally rewarding to invest in gold, but it has its drawbacks. You run the risk of someone stealing your metal, or you won’t get the full market value when you sell it. You can avoid these risks by buying shares in a gold-mining company, which has the benefit of being a liquid investment and will give you diversified exposure to the metal without having to physically hold it.\nA currency investment is another way to invest in Gold. This allows you to buy the commodity and sell it in the same way as a mutual fund or foreign exchange traded fund. This option provides a higher level liquidity than owning gold, and allows you to take advantage tax breaks in your country.\nGold is a good hedge against economic instability, no matter what type of investment you make. Investors seek out gold in times of high geopolitical and market volatility. Gold is a good option for those who wish to protect their wealth against currency depreciation.\nIt’s A Currency\nGold has been used for money throughout history. Despite this, many investors tend to consider it a commodity rather than a currency. This view can be problematic. Gold behaves as a currency. It moves in a manner opposite to paper currency and can mitigate risk to these assets when there is market or geopolitical turmoil.\nGold prices will fall if the USD increases, and vice versa. Moreover, gold has a positive correlation with the Euro. Gold is a great hedge against inflation. While inflation can push down the value of most currencies, gold isn’t affected by this trend.\nStorage costs can be high for gold bullion. In addition, investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can provide exposure to the metal without having to worry about storage fees or other expenses.\nIt’s important to keep in mind that ETFs hold only a portion of gold and their inflows or outflows may have an impact on its price. Unlike stocks and bonds, however, gold does not generate a dividend. This may not be the best option for traders looking to earn regular income. There are other ways of gaining exposure to gold, such as trading CFDs for gold-mining firms.\nIt’s a Commodity\nGold is a commodity, which means it serves a number of functions. It protects from inflation, diversifies portfolios, and helps hedge against currency decline. It has also shown a track record of providing solid returns for certain periods. It also tends to be low-correlated with stocks and bonds. Investors like it because of this, especially in times of fear and uncertainty – such as recent bank failures which have shook the markets.\nYou can invest in gold through physical assets like gold bars and coins or through exchange traded funds (ETFs), which track the gold price. Physical gold is the more traditional way to purchase the metal. It can be stored in a safe or a safety deposit at a bank. Storing physical assets is expensive. The risk of theft is always present.\nInvestors who are more experienced and want to be hands-off can consider options based on the price of Gold, such as futures contracts or ETFs trading gold derivatives.

56	What is the interesting legend about Robert Johnson's guitar playing abilities and what happened to him at age 27?	According to legend, Robert Johnson sold his soul to the devil at a crossroads in exchange for his masterful guitar playing technique. He died at the age of 27 in 1938, before achieving any commercial or critical success as a musician.	['There’s no question about it — the blues established the basic framework for virtually all pop music. Think about the slew of British bands during the time of their “invasion,” and the degree to which they emulated classic American blues acts. Or just look at any of the immensely popular contemporary bands who play vintage-style, blues derivative rock music — acts like The White Stripes, Gary Clark Jr., or even The Black Keys. One thing that is fundamentally good about these contemporary acts, along with other mass media influences such as the now obsolete Guitar Hero craze and television programs like DirectTV’s Guitar Center Sessions, is that they have all, undoubtedly, helped to renew the younger generation’s interest in classic blues music.\nHere is a look at the five most influential blues guitarists who permanently changed, not merely blues, but popular music as we know it today.\n5. John Lee Hooker\nHailing from Mississippi, Hooker’s style incorporated elements of Delta Blues and boogie-woogie. His style was so loose and fluid that his songs rarely conform to any conventional time signature, much to the chagrin of uptight backing musicians who couldn’t keep up. Hooker did manage to sync up nicely with some high profile acts though, including Van Morrison and the band Canned Heat, with whom Hooker recorded the full length album in 1970, Hooker N’ Heat. Hooker also made an appearance in the hit film The Blues Brothers, delivering a performance that was recorded live on Chicago’s historic Maxwell Street.\n4. Robert Johnson\nSo good, that he earned his own urban folklore. Legend has it that he sold his soul at a crossroads to the devil in exchange for his masterful guitar playing technique. In 1938, he died at the age of 27 (sound eerily familiar?), and never got to taste commercial or critical success as a musician. Today, he’s heralded as a true master of delta blues, and one of the most significant blues guitarists of all-time. Not much is known about Johnson, as he used several pseudonyms while traveling on the road. Among the recordings he produced during his short life were “Cross Road Blues” and “Terraplane Blues.” His distinctive boogie bass lines that he strums, such as the one heard in the song “I Believe I’ll Dust My Broom,” helped to set the foundation for rock music as we know it today.\n3. B.B. King\nHis distinctly slow string bends and deep vibrato influenced some of the most popular guitarists of all-time, including George Harrison, Eric Clapton, and Jimmy Page. Among his several hits were the songs “Please Love Me,” and “Woke Up This Morning.” In his heyday, he would perform most nights of the year. It’s been said that in 1956, he performed 342 shows. Even now, the 88-year-old King performs up to 100 shows a year. King once said that one of the best performances he ever delivered was at the Sing Sing prison.\n2. Chuck Berry\nBerry popularized certain techniques that would be adopted by countless other blues and rock guitarists, such as the unison bend and his rapid fire pentatonic scale soloing. Berry was also notable for introducing a new brand of showmanship to rock performances, and was a popular staple on television in the 1950s and 1960s, thanks to his signature duck walk and uptempo numbers. He recorded such staples as “Johnny B. Goode,” “Maybellene,” and “Roll Over Beethoven.” While he’s had his scuffles with the law, Berry owns, and still frequently performs at the restaurant Blueberry Hill, located in his hometown of St. Louis.\n1. Jimi Hendrix\nNo one else has been emulated so closely by modern rock and blues guitarists. So many things informed Jimi Hendrix’s sound: it was partially his love of blues greats like John Lee Hooker and T-Bone Walker, and partially the complexity of the emotions he channeled — presumably all the more volatile and passionate because of his struggles with manic depression. And yes, it was probably partially his LSD-soaked headband as well. Even though strictly speaking, he had only one commercial hit throughout his career with his rendition of the Bob Dylan-penned “All Along the Watchtower,” without Hendrix, popular music as we know it today simply would not exist. Even his contemporaries borrowed liberally from his influence, whether we’re talking about Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, or Tony Iommi. Hendrix introduced elements of jazz-influenced dissonance to rock, with chords like his signature dominant seventh sharp ninth chord, heard prominently in the verse to “Purple Haze.”\n– Brandon Engel']	['<urn:uuid:f1d20011-5218-4829-86ab-b23bc4f75a18>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	19	41	752
57	As someone leading strategic partnerships, I need to understand the dynamics of organizational change and collaboration - what value can organizations gain through collaborative approaches, and what specific employee concerns typically arise during collaborative changes?	Organizations can gain value through collaboration by accessing new markets, skills, experience, resources and capabilities, while also addressing systemic social and environmental challenges through cross-sector partnerships. However, employees typically have specific concerns during collaborative changes, including: fear of job insecurity, worry about their ability to perform in new situations, concerns about breaking up existing work groups, and anxiety about potential loss of power or income. These personal implications often drive resistance more than organizational factors.	['Negotiating, Collaboration and Partnering\nThe relevance of collaborative versus competitive actions is investigated, together with a review of current research and practice regarding organisations in networks and ecosystems and the barriers which make collaborative actions difficult. The role and importance of integrative approaches to finding agreement is explored in depth, alongside best practice approaches and processes to developing and managing cross-sector and multi-stakeholder arrangements. The content is communicated through a combination of interactive lectures and discussion of group based case examples and case examples, and developed through a group-based exercise embedded into the module, which is structured as a four-party negotiation of a complex multi-sector issue.\nThere is no national basis to this module as it is completely culturally independent. The embedded group exercise, running throughout the module, explores cross-cultural aspects to reaching agreement.\nYou will have the option of developing your individual assignment with an external organisation of your choice. A guest speaker will develop the module themes referencing a current business context.\nThis is a very practical module with extensive reference to academic research on the subjects of collaboration, cooperation, negotiation and partnership process and practice. You will have the opportunity to gain both practical experience and an understanding of negotiating, resolving tensions or conflicts, identifying mutually beneficial outcomes and overcoming biases held by individuals or organisations that might impede future value creation.\nThe entire content is related to the main theme of sustainability, and a significant part of the module is concerned with moving beyond economic value towards social, environmental and other forms of value that are recognised as drivers of sustainable and responsible management practice.\nAll of the resources for this module are available on the ELE (Exeter Learning Environment).\nFull module specification\n|Module title:||Negotiating, Collaboration and Partnering|\n|Duration of module:||\nDuration (weeks) - term 2: |\n4 day module (+ 8 weeks study)\nCompetition brings a host of benefits through the efficient allocation (and constant reallocation) of resources towards the achievement of productive outcomes. A growing body of evidence however suggests that competition works best alongside active and considered cooperation, and that behaviours based on simplistic judgements of winning or losing will very often lead to lost opportunities, and to sub-optimal outcomes.\nThis module aims to introduce you to the challenges and benefits of negotiating, collaboration and partnering to achieve strategic objectives in a sustainable manner. Developing and implementing good strategy is difficult enough in simple environments: it is even tougher in a world where organisations are interconnected through multiple alliances and partnerships, by ever more closely aligned value networks, and by their common use of limited resources. Collaboration can be a strategic objective in itself, for accessing new markets, skills, experience, resources and capabilities: while responses to systemic social, environmental or developmental challenges might require partnership across organisations in more than one of the business, civil society and public sectors. Whatever the reason, the imperative to collaborate is increasingly significant: yet there is much evidence that many partnerships and collaborative initiatives fail. This raises a challenge for leaders, who must demonstrate competence in identifying where cooperative approaches might be relevant in meeting their strategic aims, while showing that they can make them work successfully.\nILO: Module-specific skills\n- 1. Understand the basic principles of negotiating, collaboration and partnering as relevant in different strategic contexts.\n- 2.

(2008) Talking the Walk: A Communication Manual for Partnership Practitioners. IBLF, London\nLast revision date', 'How organizations manage resistance to change\nSevere competitive and economic pressures that organizations face today were unthinkable a few decades ago. In order to shed excess costs and to respond more nimbly to customers and competitors, they are being urged to adopt new organizational forms, tightened inter organizational linkages and improved management practices (cf. Miles and Snow 1980, Johnston and Lawrence, 1988). Any change in organization is followed by a kind of resistance from its employees. In this assignment a few methods that can be used to overcome change in the organization are described.\nTechnology developments, social and demographic shifts, competition of changing market and economic issues, tend an organization to implement change in it as well. The rapid and dynamic change in market has increased consumerism. Whether it is an automobile industry or cosmetic industry or IT industry, consumer today has lots of choices these days that they need not have to wait for longer for any product. This changing market scenario imparts a message to managing bodies that the way of work should also change with the changing market. From managerial point of view a change is referred to as change in work pattern, work routine and work culture inside the working atmosphere. Change is normally a reaction to changing commercial, technological, economical, structural and strategic environment in which the company operates (Barbara Senior, Organizational Change). For example; departmentalization, job redesign, implementation of an international division are the examples of structural changes whereas work processes, methods and equipments are technological changes.\nChange should be welcomed as it can produce positive benefits for the individuals, bring opportunities for personal change and development, reduces boredom of work, provides new challenges and an opportunity to participate and shape the outcome. But unfortunately as change is accompanied by resistance, it is very important that the Change Manager anticipate and plan strategies for dealing with resistance not only at the introduction of change but also for monitoring the change over long term (Ronald, G and Smith, J 1995). It is helpful to understand why people resist change, because understanding this allows us to plan strategies to reduce resistance from the beginning. Kotter and Schlesinger identified the basic reasons of resistance to change are communication gap and inadequate information that creates misunderstanding, sense of insecurity, different assessment of situation and disagreement over advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, individuals are more concerned with the implications for themselves (Management by Robbins and Coulter).\nOrganizations do not change, individuals do. No matter how large is the project you are taking on, the success of project ultimately lies with each employee doing their work differently multiplied across all of employees impacted by the change (Web 1). Individual barriers to change include- tradition and set ways; loyalty to existing relationships; failure to accept the need for change; insecurity; preference for the existing arrangements; break up of work groups; different person ambitions; fear of power; skills and income; inability to perform as well in the new situation as for example, when quality control methods based on statistical models were introduced into manufacturing units, the quality control department have to learn the new methods. Some may fear that they will be unable to do so and may develop negative attitude towards the change or perform poorly if required to use the new methods. Sometimes change is resisted because of failures in the way it is introduced to the employees and the management fails to explain the need for change and its future benefits. Poor employer relations, lack of involvement in process and failure to offer support and training for the introduced change are the other reasons for change resistance (Web 2).\nResisting change takes many forms (Web 3) and the more obvious form is of active resistance, objection and refusal to cooperate with the change occurs. Sometimes, resistance appears to be individual and sometimes it is clearly situational. It may be passive in which colleagues agree to a change but are unwilling or unable to implement something new. This subtle form of resistance is dealt with more difficulty. For example, at a staff meeting everyone agrees to follow a new procedure, but after several weeks it is being discovered that the procedure has not been implemented yet. Another example of this kind is the introduction of new computers at the new place but virtually no one is using them for the purpose for which they are intended, since the staff had their own machines. The employee consents to change by agreeing to it but later he only changes to appear cooperative, but in fact he is doing most things the way he was before the change.\nAt the moment the change program is announced, many employees will employ tactics to protect themselves, their turf, and ultimately their place in the organization.Ã‚Â Some will aggressively challenge the necessity for change. This is a time waster and thus prevents critical objectives from being met. Every person who facilitates the change process must work diligently to build consensus. The employee must be assured that every idea is worth considering. If anyone argues, he or she can be asked to explain why he or she feels the way they do and ask for three or four suggestions for making the process work.Ã‚Â Some managers and members of the leadership team will avoid change by passively refusing the commitment to the process. Often these leaders will resist the change effort by being unavailable for meetings, denying resources, or withholding feedback. “The leadership” is a particularly difficult foe, because change efforts often require the use of resources managed by the leadership, such as time and money. Without these resources change efforts are likely to fail. Accountability with consequences is the primary means for assuring leadership participation. Many employees and organizational leaders search for personal or professional diversions during the change process that will ultimately hinder the effort. A distracted individual can undermine the change effort by not being present physically or mentally when his or her critical input is needed. Not being mindful of change creates an unnecessarily difficult experience for every member of the team. Such carelessness calls to mind the wasted energy expended when one runs against the wind. Change efforts provide an opportunity for every one affected to secure a new place in the organization or make a decision to seek a better fit elsewhere.\nKen Hultman argues that while no-one is a perfect change agent, managers have to be impeccable role models for bringing up a successful change. The essential attributes of such a person include the ability to be a clear thinker who is able to get a view about organizational situation and reach at logical conclusions. Hultman suggests few things in creating the right environment for change to occur. Firstly we must do things to establish a positive climate (p172) and secondly we must attempt to create environmental conditions that encourage an interest in improvement. Managers must demonstrate that how changes will improve employees circumstances and that there are opportunities in the change such as enabling colleagues to increase their knowledge and skills leading to genuine achievements and progress They must cultivate a value for collaborative working among staff and colleagues need each other to complete their tasks, it is easier to develop values of co-operation and mutuality. Whatever are the circumstances management must stay calm. At the heart of HultmanÃ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s analysis is a set of humanistic values along with an assumption that one cannot even hope to influence another colleague without firstly demonstrating that they will have their needs met in some way. It is likely to be counterproductive by getting impatient, exasperated and angry.\nBeing a change manager it is his/her duty to reduce the resistance towards change and towards change and to increase the enthusiasm and level of commitment for the change. While likely to encounter the people who resist change, people who welcome change will also be encountered and by knowing the reasons for their acceptance to change, the communication plan will be better formulated. People will accept change when they see possibility that they will gain something from the change. The gain may be either personal like, money; increased job security; status; self satisfaction; less effort and time and gain in better personal contact or other like it provides new challenges, likeness of the source, reduction in boredom etc.\nIn order to reduce resistance to change, the manager should involve people affected by change, actively seeking their thoughts and reactions to proposed changes. They must develop a proper attitude towards resistance to change and realize that it is neither good nor bad. The best way to minimize resistance to change is to involve those responsible for implementing it and those affected by it. People are more motivated towards successful completion when they feel that they are the valued participants in planning and implementing the change. Also ensure that people from all the levels of organization are involved in planning the change process and they should be listened carefully. In the early stages, manager should not launch into lengthy diatribes justifying the change as people are not interested in that. They want to be heard and have their concerns attended to. They must recognize that it takes time to work through reactions to change. Then people should be engaged in dialogue about the change. They should do this only after understanding the specific concerns of others completely. Change must be realistic, achievable and measurable.\nCommunication and education is helpful method to sort out the things when resistance is due to lack of information or inappropriate information and analysis. Though time consuming, this method provides great employee support if persuaded. When cause of resistance is difficulty in adjustment to changes, management support and facilitation do work at times. This is expensive and still unreliable way to overcome the change. Manipulation of some information is necessary some times in order to avoid negative reactions by the employee. The people that easily accept changes and get adapted to changing atmosphere can set an example for others and hence they follow the suit. Therefore, they should be the first target of change program.\nThree basic steps- planning, implementation, and evaluation of outcomes of both the plan and implementation are involved in the change process. Resistance to change should be dealt ideally with planning and early stages of implementation. For proper planning for change, a manager must consider about how and when the change is needed and the way it should be communicated to the employees for their better support. Managers should pay attention to the focus of change, the amount of change, and the rate of change in order to implement change. Evaluation of outcomes of change is also very important as all the change efforts are result oriented. If change is not monitored, its effectiveness cannot be measured. This can be done by collecting data and comparing the results against original goals.\nTo wind up at the end of an interesting discussion we can conclude that a degree of resistance is normal since change is disruptive and stressful but in general, most people have mixed reactions towards purposed change, so the change agents can be helpful in highlighting the positive aspects in realistic manner. Although most people feel comfortable with minor changes, no one can live and work by yesterdayÃ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reality. Managers must reduce change in very effective, meaningful and healthy way without hurting the sentiments of the employees. By providing resources to support the changes, allowing enough time and flexibility and with the widespread commitment of people throughout the organization, change efforts will succeed.\n(2) Hultman, K.

58	ophthalmologist researching childhood nearsightedness causes risks environmental genetic factors	Myopia can develop due to the eyeball growing too long during childhood, curved cornea/lens, or lens position. High myopia has a genetic component with 5-7% heredity rate in children. Environmental factors include premature birth, low birth weight, inadequate breast feeding (particularly DHA), maternal alcoholism, congenital infections, and urban living. The condition requires management as it can progress to high myopia, potentially leading to complications like retinal detachment, glaucoma, and vision loss.	"[""Is there a way to “fix” short-sightedness?\nCurrently, there is no cure for myopia (short-sightedness). Blurry vision caused by myopia can be corrected, and myopia progression can be slowed, leading optoemtrists refer to these methods as myopia management, not as treatment or cures.\nMyopia is not an eye disease, it's a refractive error that is often caused by the eyeball growing too long during childhood. Myopia can also develop if the cornea and/or the lens of the eye are too curved. In rare cases, myopia can occur if the lens is too close to the cornea.\nAny of these factors can cause the light entering the eye to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it. This makes distant objects look blurry.\nThere are proven methods that can be prescribed by an optometrist to correct myopia. Correction refers to corrective lenses and refractive surgery. Corrective lenses can provide clearer vision, but they only work while a person is wearing them. They do not cure the causes of myopia.\nOnce myopia has stabilised (usually by the age of 24), refractive surgery may be an option. LASIK and other types of laser eye surgery can be effective long-term corrections for myopia. However, even surgery is not a cure for the causes of myopia. In some cases, some amount of myopia can return even after surgery.\nMyopia control glasses\nMyopia control contact lenses\nAtropine eye drops\nLifestyle changes (increased time outdoors and decreased prolonged near work)\nMyopia control is necessary because myopia can progress to high myopia, which can result in potentially blinding complications, including:\nMyopia control glasses and contact lenses are not the same as standard prescription lenses. They are special multifocus lenses that can slow the eye growth that leads to myopia.\nThese lenses have shown success in slowing myopia progression. And newer, even more effective designs are constantly being developed. Examples of these designs include:\nThe Stellest lens by Essilor, which uses Highly Aspherical Lenslet Target (HALT) technology\nThe MiYOSMART lens by Hoya, which uses Defocus Incorporated Multiple Segments (DIMS) technology\nOrthokeratology (also called ortho-k) has also been successful in myopia management and control. Orthokeratology lenses reshape the cornea during sleep, temporarily correcting myopia. Ortho-k is not a cure for myopia, the contact lenses must be worn regularly at night, or the myopia and blurry vision will return.\nAtropine eye drops are used in low doses for myopia control. Scientists do not fully understand how they work, but they show the greatest success in slowing the eye growth related to myopia.\nLifestyle factors also play a part in myopia control. Keeping good visual habits is essential to reducing the risk of developing myopia. Leading optometrists recommend spending at least 90 minutes outdoors per day. They also recommend taking frequent breaks during prolonged near work activities.\nIf you want to learn more about myopia correction and control, schedule an eye exam with an optoemtrist near you.\nBeth Longware Duff also contributed to this article.\nUpdate and guidance on management of myopia.

This has only mildly effect on ocular wellness. Prolonged untreated low myopia can cause chronic eye strain, retinal tears, glaucoma, headaches, and sensitivity to light. The risk of retinal detachment increases with the worse form of low myopia. The power of low myopia does not progress after the age of 21. The low myopia mainly results from environmental factors and there occurs a correlation failure of refractive power of lens and retina. This type of myopia usually get stabilizes with the growth.\nTreatment: The low myopia control is done by corrective eye glasses or contacts lenses. Laser procedures or radial keratotomy (RA) can be done at about 18-21years when the power becomes stable. But the disadvantage of laser treatment is that, it may cause dense scars in some individuals. This central scarring can cause blurred vision permanently. Whereas in radial keratotomy the central area remains clear.\nWhat is very high myopia?\nHigh myopia is a chronic, degenerative condition, sometimes referred to as pathological myopia or degenerative myopia. It is a very serious condition of extreme myopia that causes profound alteration of the shape of the eye, eventually leading to near vision loss. Short sight of −8.00D or more is regarded as high myopia; it can go up to -20D. The chance of retinal detachment and primary open angle glaucoma are prominent in a high myopic eye. In high myopia vision, floaters or shadow-like bodies are experienced in the field of vision. The high myopia progresses from childhood to old age. About 30% of nearsighted has high myopia at birth. Some of the common symptoms of high myopia include headache, squinting, eye strain and eye tiredness. An ethnic difference also noted in the incidence of high myopia. Asian population is more susceptible to high myopia than others.\nThe causes for high short sightedness are either the elongation of the eyeballs, or the stretching and thinning of the retina and sclera, eventually leads to bulging of posterior part of the eye, called staphyloma.\nThe deformation of the eye can cause strain on the retina which eventually gets damaged and provoke other changes that can lead to problem with vision or loss of vision. Tears or openings in the retina due to high shortsightedness makes the retina loose or detach from the rest of the eye. A detached retina can cause irreversible blindness if not treated promptly. The retinal detachment occurs as a complication of high myopia. Other complications include, complicated cataract, degenerative changes, and amblyopia.\nVery High Myopia in Children\nMyopia in children is a serious degenerative eye condition. The babies of highly shortsighted parents are more prone to develop high myopia i.e. heredity accounts for 5-7% of high myopia in children. There are a number of environmental factors involved in the development of high myopia. The increased susceptibility to eye myopia is observed in prematurely born children. The sooner they are born before the full term of pregnancy, the higher the chance of myopia. The probable reason is that their eyes are forced to function in spite of being not completely developed. Low birth weight is another important factor which predisposes the high myopia. Just like nutrition is an important factor during the growth of babies, the eyes also needs nutrients to develop. DHA present in human breast is a major factor involved the development of healthy eye. Inadequate breast feeding due to busy lifestyle may be a reason for the increased cases of myopia these days. Incidences of high myopia are more in children who grow rapidly than normal. Maternal alcoholism, prolonged illness with fever, congenital infection with Toxoplasma, Rubella, and toxaemias are the other factors influencing high myopia. A rural urban difference also noted in the incidence of high myopia. High myopia is more common in urban areas compared to urban areas. The exact reason for this is not known but could be due to the life style changes and inadequate breast feeding.\nSome people have very high myopia in only one eye only\nThe child’s performance in school is badly affected by severe myopia symptoms. The general complications associated with high myopia in children are difficulty in seeing the writing board, difficulty in reading text, light sensitivity, and headaches. It’s crucial to provide emotional and mental support to children in addition to the medical support.\nIs there a solution for very high myopia?\nHow to treat myopia? Treatment for nearsightedness only addresses the symptoms.\nCorrection with eye glasses: The strong glasses for myopia correct the focus error in this refractive problem. These glasses are extremely thick and heavy. But these strong eyeglasses glasses for nearsightedness negatively affect the off-axis viewing of objects away from the centre of the lens, eventually results in chromatic aberration by the prismatic movement and separation of colours. Colour fringes are viewed around strongly contrasting colours.\nCorrection with contact lenses: The preferred method of correction is by using contact lenses, as the lens move with the cornea and always stay centered with the gaze. This can avoid the use of thick and heavy glasses. Implantable contact lenses are also found to be promising for high myopia treatment. Additional refractive problems, such as astigmatism, or curvature of the eye, can also be corrected in the same way. Patients usually report having better vision when wearing contact lenses. These lenses eliminate the problems that the eyewear causes.\nCorrection with laser surgery: Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) are two similar surgical techniques that are used for the treatment of myopia by reshaping the cornea using an excimer laser.

59	What specific clothing restrictions were placed on regular citizens in colonial Massachusetts regarding expensive accessories?	A 1651 Massachusetts law prohibited any person whose estate was worth less than £200 from wearing gold or silver lace, gold and silver buttons, bone lace above 2 shillings per yard, or silk hoods and scarves. Violation of these restrictions resulted in a 10 shilling penalty for each offense.	['During a recent blog team meeting, one of my colleagues mentioned restrictions during the early modern era concerning who could consume that newly discovered drink–chocolate. Having studied medieval history in college, I was reminded that during the Middle Ages there had also been efforts to pass laws regulating many aspects of daily life, with the aim of limiting excess–for example certain accoutrements or textiles. Goldwork and cloth of gold were usually restricted for the use of high(est) nobles and their families. These laws were known as sumptuary laws. So I decided to do a little research on this subject.\nI started with one of our most useful resources, Gale Encyclopedia of American Law. The entry for sumptuary laws is short. It states in part, that “sumptuary laws are designed to regulate habits, especially on moral or religious grounds … These laws existed in Rome and were enacted in a variety of forms … to regulate the ornateness of dress … The primary purpose of the laws was to distinguish the different classes of people,and often, a person’s social class could be determined by something as simple as the style or length of his or her coat.”\nSeveral of the sumptuary laws from the time of Elizabeth I of England are available online and make for entertaining reading. Four of these laws were passed on May 6 and 7, 1562, four years after her accession to the throne. May 1562 was a busy month for the Queen and her government. The Calendar of British State Papers reveals that at the beginning of the month the Queen’s government was preoccupied with intrigues of Lady Lennox , and her illicit contacts with Mary, Queen of Scotland – women who were both possible Catholic heirs to the English throne. Despite these worries, the government was also concerned with the enforcement of existing dress codes. In May 1562, they issued four laws on this subject. The first law regulating clothing is simply an enforcement of existing legislation passed by her father Henry VIII and her sister Queen Mary I regarding the “excess of apparel.” The accompanying law on ruffs, hose and sword is a combination of the penalties for excessive apparel along with specific regulations for tailors and hosiers. The penalty for transgressing the statutes on excessive apparel was a hefty two hundred marks while tailors and hosiers who contravened the regulations on hose would be assessed £40 – if they could not or would not pay then they could not longer work as tailors. Given these substantial penalties, enforcement of the sumptuary laws would appear to have been a money raising exercise as much as enforcement of the Elizabethan dress codes.1\nThe 1574 Elizabethan sumptuary law provides another insight into contemporary concerns. The law begins with a statement about how the importing of excess apparel and unnecessary foreign wares in essentially bankrupting the country:\nThe excess of apparel and the superfluity of unnecessary foreign wares thereto belonging now of late years is grown by sufferance to such an extremity that the manifest decay of the whole realm generally is like to follow (by bringing into the realm such superfluities of silks, cloths of gold, silver, and other most vain devices of so great cost for the quantity thereof as of necessity the moneys and treasure of the realm is and must be yearly conveyed out of the same to answer the said excess) but also particularly the wasting and undoing of a great number of young gentlemen, otherwise serviceable, and others seeking by show of apparel to be esteemed as gentlemen, who, allured by the vain show of those things, do not only consume themselves, their goods, and lands which their parents left unto them, but also run into such debts and shifts as they cannot live out of danger of laws without attempting unlawful acts, whereby they are not any ways serviceable to their country as otherwise they might be:\nIn other words, the pursuit of fine clothes was bringing the country into decay not only because of the upending of the import/export balance but also because young men were running through their inheritances and turning criminal to supply their desire for fancy clothes! After this dramatic beginning, the law proceeds to provide considerable detail about who can wear what, stating: “None shall wear any velvet, tufted taffeta, satin, or any gold or silver in their petticoats: except wives of barons, knights of the order, or councilors’ ladies, and gentlewomen of the privy chamber and bed chamber, and the maids of honor.”\nSumptuary laws were present in the American colonies. A 1651 Massachusetts law restricts any person whose estates does not exceed £200 pounds from wearing “any gold or silver lace, or gold and silver buttons, or any bone lace above 2s. per yard, or silk hoods, or scarves, upon the penalty of 10s. for every such offense.” Interestingly enough, although there are no sumptuary laws in in the United States today, Federal courts have upheld the right of companies to impose dress codes on their employees (West’s Federal Practice Digest 4th, Labor and Employment,§83) ruling that dress codes are not a violation of employees’ civil rights.\n A quick survey on the equivalence between Elizabethan currency and modern values shows that one pound would be equivalent to $400 today. A “mark” was not coinage, but was calculated at the value of 2/3rd of a pound, so a fine of 200 marks would currently equal about $53,000.']	['<urn:uuid:ad63d707-c431-445f-bbe4-88e472784a04>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	15	49	913

62	I'm new to Formula 2 racing and watched the Silverstone sprint race. Could you tell me what happened with Dan Ticktum and how he managed to win the race?	Dan Ticktum scored his first FIA Formula 2 victory at the Silverstone sprint race. Starting from reverse-grid pole position, he led every lap of the race. While he built up a comfortable lead initially, a late safety car period threatened his victory by allowing his closest challenger Christian Lundgaard to change tires and mount a late charge. However, Ticktum managed to hold off Lundgaard in a three-lap dash to the finish, winning by just under four tenths of a second.	"['Silverstone F2: Ticktum beats Lundgaard in thriller\nDan Ticktum scored his first FIA Formula 2 victory in a thrilling Silverstone sprint race, surviving a late charge from Christian Lundgaard.\nDAMS driver Ticktum led every lap from reverse-grid pole, but a late safety car period threatened his victory as it allowed Lundgaard and others the chance to change tyres at little cost and try and regain the time loss in a three-lap dash to the finish.\nThe plan came close to succeeding for Lundgaard, who fell just under four tenths of a second shy of victory but recovered to the position he was in when he pitted.\nAt the start, Ticktum made a clean getaway to maintain his advantage, as ART Grand Prix driver Lundgaard picked off a slow-starting Callum Ilott, Louis Deletraz and Felipe Drugovich to move up to second on the opening lap.\nBut Lundgaard was unable to make inroads on Ticktum\'s advantage, and later was forced to turn his attention towards defending from a charging Ilott.\nUNI-Virtuosi driver Ilott picked up a five-second time penalty for tipping Carlin\'s Yuki Tsunoda into a spin at Village on the first lap of 21, causing a brief virtual safety car period, but regrouped to pass Drugovich for fourth at Stowe on lap seven.\nOn lap 13, the Briton passed Deletraz and Lundgaard on the same lap with a pair of around-the-outside passes at Brooklands and Stowe respectively.\nTicktum was 2.6s clear of the field at this point but Ilott started tearing chunks from the leader\'s advantage, and had closed to within a second of Ticktum when he spun exiting Vale on lap 15, stalling and ending his charge.\nThat brought out the safety car, as well as eradicating what had become a four-second buffer out front for Ticktum.\nWith the field filing through the pitlane while Ilott\'s stricken car was retrieved, ART pounced on the chance to put Lundgaard on a fresh set of medium-compound tyres, the Danish driver only losing three positions in the process.\nThat meant Ticktum would lead Deletraz at the restart on lap 19, with the remaining UNI-Virtuosi car of Guanyu Zhou promoted to third, while race one winner Nikita Mazepin lost fourth to a charging Lundgaard into Village.\nOn the next lap, Lundgaard dispatched Zhou at Brooklands and at the start of the final tour he picked off Deletraz at The Loop. But the one-second buffer Ticktum had at this point was just enough for him to hold off Lundgaard at the chequered flag.\nBehind the lead pair, Charouz driver Deletraz completed the podium in third, his pressure eased by Zhou spinning away fourth place on the last lap at Chapel.\nThat promoted Jehan Daruvala (Carlin), another driver to take the chance to take new tyres under the safety car, to fourth, the Indian having taken the restart in 10th.\nMazepin came home in fifth ahead of the two MP Motorsport cars of Drugovich and Nobuharu Matsushita, while Campos man Jack Aitken completed the scorers.\nPrema opted to change both Mick Schumacher and Robert Shwartzman onto new tyres, but only did so after another lap had passed and the field had bunched up more, with Shwartzman losing time stacked behind his teammate and then with a slow stop.\nThe points leader finished down in 13th, a place ahead of teammate Schumacher.\nWith closest rival Ilott failing to score, Shwartzman maintains a lead of eight points at the head of the standings, with Lundgaard moving to within 12 of the Russian driver, boosted by taking the two bonus points for fastest lap.\n|1||2|| Dan Ticktum ||DAMS||21|\n|2||6|| Christian Lundgaard ||ART Grand Prix||21||0.376|\n|3||11|| Louis Deletraz ||Charouz Racing System||21||2.697|\n|4||8|| Jehan Daruvala ||Carlin||21||6.257|\n|5||24|| Nikita Mazepin ||HitechGP||21||6.483|\n|6||15|| Felipe Drugovich ||MP Motorsport||21||8.459|\n|7||14|| Nobuharu Matsushita ||MP Motorsport||21||8.956|\n|8||9|| Jack Aitken ||Campos Racing||21||9.782|\n|9||3|| Guanyu Zhou ||UNI-Virtuosi||21||10.848|\n|10||5|| Marcus Armstrong ||ART Grand Prix||21||10.995|\n|11||16|| Artem Markelov ||HWA AG||21||17.417|\n|12||23|| Marino Sato ||Trident||21||18.643|\n|13||21|| Robert Shwartzman ||Prema Powerteam||21||22.320|\n|14||20|| Mick Schumacher ||Prema Powerteam||21||26.230|\n|15||10|| Guilherme Samaia ||Campos Racing||21||28.531|\n|16||22|| Roy Nissany ||Trident||21||31.974|\n|17||12|| Pedro Piquet ||Charouz Racing System||21||41.395|\n|18||17|| Giuliano Alesi ||HWA AG||20||1 Lap|\n|19||25|| Luca Ghiotto ||HitechGP||19||2 Laps|\n|1|| Sean Gelael ||DAMS||16|\n|4|| Callum Ilott ||UNI-Virtuosi||14|\n|7|| Yuki Tsunoda ||Carlin||0|\n|View full results|\nSilverstone F2: Mazepin charges to maiden victory\nTicktum: F2 win proves Red Bull\'s ""doubt"" wrong']"	['<urn:uuid:7951381f-f7fa-4419-9743-ac5e1f7543ba>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	29	80	719
63	remodeling walk in shower tile size difference between walls and floor explain why large walls small floor	For shower walls, larger sized tiles (like 12 x 24, 24 x 24, or 18 x 36) are recommended because they create fewer grout lines, making maintenance easier. However, for shower floors, smaller format tiles (1 x 1 to 3 x 3) mounted on mesh are necessary for safety reasons. The smaller tiles on the floor create more grout lines, which provide better traction when wet. This becomes particularly important for people requiring assistance or older individuals. Additionally, mesh-mounted smaller tiles flex better with the shower floor's slant, making installation easier.	['The most common question I receive when remodeling showers is what is the best tile for a shower wall or floor? Given there are so many options; it’s easy to get confused and overwhelmed.\nHaving remodeled showers for over 17 years now, I’m going to make it super simple for you so you can focus on getting on with your project!\nLet’s start with the best tile for your shower walls then move to the floor so everything ties in.\nBest Tile For Shower Walls\nFirst thing to consider is the material. If you want a thorough review of all materials available, you can check that out here.\nFor simplicity however, I’ll rank your best three options in order based on my experience with shower remodels:\n#1 Glazed Porcelain Tile\nThe very best material you can put on a shower wall is a larger sized glazed porcelain tile. Why? Well, glazed porcelain is sealed so it won’t stain, very durable, super easy to clean and comes in any size and color you desire.\nIn fact, the current technology is so good, you can get these tiles in just about any look: wood, marble, etc. without having to worry about the associated costs and maintenance that comes with other materials like natural stone.\nNow I say larger sized because the larger the tile, the less grout lines so the easier the maintenance. The most popular sizes now are 12 x 24 and if you want to go even larger, 24 x 24 or 18 x 36.\nAnother advantage many folks don’t realize with porcelain tile is in the event the tile you selected doesn’t come with a coordinating bullnose piece and you don’t want to put a Schulter edge, then a skilled installer can fashion a bullnose from the tile itself.\nSo going with a larger porcelain tile for your shower walls gives you the best of both worlds – a great look, versatility, lower cost and very little maintenance. Covers all your bases. For those reasons, this is my number once choice for best shower wall tile.\n#2 Glazed Ceramic Tile\nThe only real difference between a ceramic and porcelain is your porcelain is fired from finer clays at a much higher temperature so it hardens more. You will find porcelain tile prevalent in most tile manufacturer’s product lines but if for some unknown reason you cannot get porcelain, this will be your next best choice.\nSince a lot of ceramics are red bodied, you can’t make a bullnose out of the tile if you need one so be sure to get bullnose/edging for this option if you go with it. This is a good, safe choice particularly for redoing rental properties where resilient but economical options are needed.\n#3 – Natural Stone\nI realize a lot of salespeople try to sell the natural stones like marble, travertine, etc. because not only do they cost more to buy, but also to install. While they are very beautiful, they are softer so are easier to crack, are porous so are easier to stain and need proper maintenance to preserve their pristine look they have when newly installed.\nDepending where you live, foundation issues/shifting and/or hard water may be a problem with natural stone. They can sometimes collect mineral deposits and if not properly sealed, can permanently stain/damage the tile.\nSo unless you have a very high quality penetrating stone sealer like Aqua Mix and it’s applied correctly and you’re aware of it’s natural properties, you’re better off with a stronger porcelain tile.\nEven if well sealed, stone can ugly out over time from a very fine coating of water deposits so stone color enhancers would be needed to restore the vividness of the tile.\nQuick Tip: If you go with natural stone, be sure to clean it with the recommended stone cleaners. DO NOT use anything with ammonia in it like Windex as it will strip the sealer over time and you’ll wonder why your stone is turning into Frankenstein.\nIf you’re looking for the best bang for your buck tile for your shower walls, without doubt glazed porcelain tile is the best I’ve personally worked with. They are less expensive to buy, install and maintain than natural stone and above all – they look fantastic.\nTry to avoid high gloss or shiny tiles as a lot of clients found they show water spots easier than a matte finish tile. You can always use other materials as accents if you’re doing a particular pattern like glass, stone or metal but having the bulk of the walls porcelain tile is your best bet.\nIf you wish to have a specific decorative or mosaic made from another material like glass or metal for example; just be sure they are comparable in thickness so you get an even finish.\nBest Tile For Shower Floors\nEven more critical than the type of tile you put on a shower floor is the size of it.\nThe shower floor (aka shower pan) needs different tile than anywhere else mainly due to safety. Although larger tile is recommended for the shower walls, you want to go with a smaller format for the shower floor.\nA mesh mounted mosaic where each individual squares range from 1 x 1 to 3 x 3 should be your go-to option. They come in square, rectangle, hexagon and many other shapes and they’re perfect for shower floors.\nThe reason you want grout lines on the shower floor is for traction. The larger the tile, the less footing you have particularly when it’s wet so go for a mesh mounted tile that comes in smaller squares. This becomes even more important for older folks or those needing assistance.\nThe main advantage with mesh mounted tile (irrespective of material) is it flexes perfectly with the slant of the shower floor making it super easy to install.\nInsist on a mosaic tile in any configuration you like for the shower floor as this is by far your best option.\nThe only other option you could do is have the installer cut smaller pieces from the main floor or wall tile and that is a cumbersome, labor intensive process that doesn’t look anywhere as good.\nAs far as material goes:\n#1 Porcelain: Once again, a bulletproof option that’s well priced and above all, has all the qualities you want in a tile that gets daily usage. It doesn’t need to be sealed and the vast majority of tile manufacturers make coordinating mosaic tile with their field tile for shower floors.\n#2 River Rocks: These have become really popular over recent years and having worked with them a lot, I’ll tell you that you will be a lot happier with the flat rocks over the rounded ones. The flatter ones are more comfortable on the feet, easier to clean and don’t need as much grout compared to the rounded ones. They come in an array of different color blends\n#3 Natural Stone: Not the place you want to put natural stone. It’s more likely to chip and stain faster on the shower floor compared to the wall. Since a lot of this material comes in a polished finish, you want to be careful putting this down especially if there are wheelchairs or assistance equipment involved.\nI have seen this work really well only when the mosaic is very small (1 x 1 squares on a 12 x 12 sized mesh) and it has been properly sealed. Aside from that, stick with options 1 or 2.\nBest Places To Buy Shower Wall & Floor Tile\nIn terms of the best places to find shower wall and floor tile for your project, the options are many.\nIf you just want the standard, plain Jane selection, you can always go to your local Home Depot or Lowe’s but if you want to see materials not carried in these stores, then these two stores is where a lot of clients buy their materials from.Their selection is huge, carry both floor, wall and shower floor tile/mosaics and they ship quickly all over the US so your project won’t be delayed.\nDon’t forget to order whatever you need with your wall and floor purchase like trim pieces, bullnose, accents, etc.\nDon’t overthink your tile selections for your shower.\nLock in a material that’s suitable for you and if you can stick with larger format on the walls and smaller on the shower floor and/or shampoo niche, then you’ll already be ready to make other important bathroom remodel decisions.\nMake sure your contractor correctly waterproofs your shower before tiling in order to give you maximum protection.\nTo protect your shower even more, be sure to get a pre sealed grout like Mapei FlexColor CQ or Fusion Pro. This will help keep your shower looking newer for longer and a whole lot easier than buying grout sealer separately and sealing it. Finally, it’s always a good idea to have a couple of extra boxes of material left over in case of future repairs. So order between 10-15% extra to allow for cuts and waste as well as for storage. That way, you can be assured they are all the same shade / lot number.\nI hope this guide has been helpful.\nPlease reach out if you’re in the DFW area should you need any help remodeling your shower.']	['<urn:uuid:55886e83-c89d-4317-a824-fdb81d7c32ff>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	17	91	1562
64	What are digital signatures' core functionalities and benefits?	Digital signatures serve multiple core functions and offer several benefits. They enable document authenticity verification, as any attempted changes after signing will result in signature invalidation. The signatures provide cost-effectiveness by eliminating the need for smart cards, readers, and software installation. They offer convenience through easy two-factor authentication and internet connection, without requiring physical storage of smart cards. The technology ensures data integrity, reliable attribution to the signer, and non-repudiation of signed documents. For businesses, they enable remote document workflows globally, with easy integration into existing systems and support for various electronic signature standards like XAdES, PAdES, and CAdES. They also facilitate ceremony by drawing attention to document's legal weight and expressing the signer's approval and intentions.	"['The Banker newspaper: ""The electronic signature goes into the phone""\n- Dear Sirs, no matter how familiar the Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) is, let us give a definition for it. What possibilities does it provide?\nKrasimir Georchev: After the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 the terminology was slightly changed – now the term is a ""Qualified Certificate for Qualified Electronic Signature"". In Bulgaria, the QES has two main usages. One of them is signing documents and electronic statements, which is legally equal to a handwritten signature on a paper. The other usage is identification of the person who signs with the signature, if the QES certificate includes an identifier such as Personal No for example. This usage will be valid up to one year after the national electronic identity scheme appears under the Electronic Identification Act.\nDimitar Nikolov: According to the Bulgarian legislation, the QES must meet certain requirements. These are: to be uniquely related to the holder, to be able to identify the signature’s holder, to be related to the data that is signed with it in a way that allows any subsequent change to be detected. The last requirement is to be stored on a qualified signature creation device: a smart card or a device that meets certain standards. Complying with these requirements, the legislation makes the QES equal to the handwritten signature - in the sense that the electronic signature allows the holder to identify himself as the author of the electronic document, to agree with the content of the document, and to protect the document from subsequent changes.\n- What would happen if someone tries to change the contents of the document after signing?\nD.N.: If such attempts have been made, the subsequent verification of the electronic signature on the document will fail, and the document will have an invalid signature.\n- What is the legal framework of the cloud QES?\nD.N.: Regulation (EU) No 910 appeared in 2014, and although remote electronic signature was offered years ago, it was its first regulation at EU level. This regulation had to become active in the national legislations by 2016, and this was carried out in Bulgaria in the Electronic Document and Electronic Certification Services Act.\n- What is the main difference between the Cloud QES and the QES on a smart card?\nD.N.: The main difference between them is that the Cloud QES displaces the QES on a smart card to a remote server platform. From now on, in order to use QES, you need to authenticate yourself through a mobile smartphone. The phone is a means of authentication - a second step in the access. Similar to the normal QES where we should have a smart card and a PIN, the Cloud QES requires a phone and a PIN in order to be used. The remote hardware cryptographic device generates a signature only after the successful two-factor authentication of the electronic signature’s holder. Mobility as a feature of the Cloud QES does not mean that it is generated in the mobile device (smartphone) - it only serves to initiate the QES into a remote server. The goal of the Cloud QES is to facilitate the use of QES and the value-added services, thereby contributing to expand the volume of e-services users, while being a catalyst for the introduction of more e-services on the Internet.\n- What are the advantages of using Cloud Qualified Electronic Signature?\nD.N.: The main advantages of Cloud QES over card QES - with high level of security, are several. For end clients, the main advantage is the convenience and easy usage - requires only a two-factor authentication mechanism and Internet connection. It is no longer necessary to store and carry the smart card. We shall also not underestimate the cost-effectiveness, because a smart card, smart card reader, and the relevant drivers in the QES set are no longer required, there is no software installation for the client and no software support. The inconveniences recently imposed by browsers, related to the use of active components when operating with smart cards, are also eliminated.\nThe Cloud QES has several advantages for the relying parties as well. It offers easy integration to added services that improve the quality and functionality of the legally-validated electronic signature by using Qualified Electronic Timestamps, by the use of Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) service, as well as formatting services for electronically signed documents, as per the standards (XAdES, PAdES, CAdES, ASiC) to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of European Parliament.\n- Please explain at “instruction” level how QES works through the mobile phone?\nD.N.: There are two major scenarios for the Cloud QES product - issuance and use in a system. Regarding the first one, up to now has been provided the possibility of issuing a ""Cloud QES"" to an individual, on the basis of already issued QES on a smart card, (soon will be possible a scenario for Cloud QES issuance in a B-Trust office). Preconditions for the first scenario are the user to have a smart device with B-Trust Mobile application installed, as well as to have a qualified electronic signature from B-Trust or another qualified certification service provider. The issuing procedure then proceeds through the following steps:\nThe user opens the BORICA online store, authenticates and signs a request for issuing Cloud QES and a Certification Services Agreement by their hardware QES. The user downloads, installs, initiates the B-Trust Mobile application, and enters authorization code (OTP), received from the application in the store page, proving ownership of the phone. The user enters a PIN (created by him) for the issued Cloud QES in B-Trust Mobile and after that follows a key pair generation process on the remote cryptographic device and creation of QES certificate. A push notification is sent to the mobile application for a successfully issued Cloud QES. If the push notifications on the phone are turned off, the user can check the status of their requests by themselves. Regarding the scenarios for using Cloud QES in any system, we should say that it can be used both to sign documents generated or uploaded in the system, as well as for entrance in the system itself. The scenarios of usage are numerous - depending on the needs of the relying party.\n- What is the security level of the new system?\nD.N.: ""Cloud QES"" is a product which architecture and principles in development meet the highest security requirements typical of other high-risk systems operated by BORICA AD. Hardware devices (HSM and servers) meet the requirements for remote signing service with QES. The algorithms used for two-factor authentication, mobile application protection, and remote signature creation are secure, public and used in a number of EU countries.\n- Who and how can issue the cloud signature?\nК.G.: Now a cloud electronic signature can be issued on the basis of an existing QES on a smart card with which the client signs the request for issuance. At a later stage will be possible to issue QES at all B-Trust offices, including local registration offices of BORICA’s partners.\n- Will we be approved for a loan by the phone from now on?\nК.G.: The short answer is ""yes"" and depends on the proposals and the way of operation of the particular bank or financial institution. There are many possible scenarios where ""Cloud QES"" is applicable to user identification and submission of loan documents, and all the correspondence in this process can be signed with Cloud QES. Other potential systems using Cloud QES can be those of banks and financial institutions, telecoms, pension insurance companies, state administration, etc.\n- At what stage is the development? What are BORICA\'s plans for marketing?\nD.N.: Currently, project tests are carried out in a production environment. We work with several relying parties for integration with their systems. We hope that the service will provoke great interest due to the numerous advantages it provides. As a result, market expansion is expected with the attraction of new clients using QES. Increasing the security and trust of the relying parties will lead to the creation of new electronic services requiring the use of QES, which will contribute to the expansion of the QES market. Due to the nature of different services using QES, clients can both possess a card and a Cloud QES. We expect that the QES market will increase by at least 50%, and in the near future by even more. On the other hand, the volume of the market will only expand when services using Cloud QES appear in the relying parties’ systems - Internet and mobile banking, telecom systems, insurance and leasing companies.\nSource: The Banker newspaper', 'The electronic signature is the possibility of conducting joint document flow online for companies and organizations that are located at different ends of the planet. When concluding a transaction electronically, it is important to find out how this type of paperwork is regulated in the state in which the other party to the agreement or contract operates.\neSign documents in Pennsylvania with DigiSigner\nFor signing electronic documents following the rules and regulations established by the law of Pennsylvania, you can use online services. DigiSigner offers simple and convenient tools for signing electronic documents remotely, even if the two parties to a contract are on different continents.\nUpload the document and scroll to where you want to sign. You can sign with the mouse, touchpad, enter details or download a ready-made signature from the device. To sign a large number of papers, you can create a template by entering the date, name, and title.\nUse the available online services to facilitate document flow, while acting within the framework of the adopted legislation on electronic documents.\nGeneral Provisions for Electronic Signatures in Pennsylvania\nPennsylvania in terms of electronic workflow is subject to the Uniform Electronic Transaction Act – UETA. It ensures the execution of electronic documents but does not oblige their use. The goal of UETA is to regulate electronic document flow. General provisions:\n- the record or signature does not lose legal force only for the reason that it is made in electronic format;\n- the contract does not lose legal force and the need for enforcement only because of its formation was used an electronic signature;\n- if the law states that a written signature certifies the document, the electronic format meets these requirements;\n- if the document requires any signature, the electronic one meets the requirements.\nThe basic principle is that the signature is not part of the very essence of the transaction, but is its presentation or form.\nPurpose of electronic signatures according to the laws of Pennsylvania:\n- certificate: the signature certifies the authenticity of the letter by linking the signatory with the document;\n- Ceremony: the act of signing draws the attention of the signatories to the legal weight of the document and allows you to prevent the obligations taken “out of order”;\n- approval: the signature expresses the approval, intention or permission of the signatory to have legal weight.\nThe parties must agree in advance that they maintain joint documentation in electronic format. Once a transaction conducted in this format does not oblige the parties to continue the business relationship in this form.\neSignature Law in Pennsylvania\nThe Electronic Transaction Act was passed in Pennsylvania in 1999. He points out to all companies the standards for using electronic signatures published by the Administrative Office. After checking the security requirements, the agency must indicate whether an electronic signature is required in documents of this format. If so, it should be provided, as amended, in the laws of Pennsylvania:\n- type of signature required;\n- the method and format in which the signature should be attached to the document;\n- the identity of the criteria to which the third party representing the signatories must comply.\nThe company is responsible for implementing the control process to ensure adequate security, integrity, security and confidentiality of documents, as well as the possibility of their audit.\nObjectives and functions of electronic signatures\nRegardless of technology, electronic signatures should provide:\n- data integrity;\n- attribution – the exact signing of the document is not a third party, but a partner;\n- reliability – the inability to refute the fact of signing the document;\n- reliability – proof that the document has not been changed after execution.\nIf the agency is subject to the laws of Pennsylvania or state laws, it is not possible to introduce more stringent procedures and complicated policies for applying electronic signature tools and technologies.\nFor an electronic signature to comply with the law, it must meet the following requirements:\n- password-based signature used in conjunction with electronic stamps or paintings;\n- provide authentication of electronic signature technology;\n- the signature must be unique to the person;\n- the signature must confirm the person’s intent to be associated with this transaction;\n- the signatory must be fully aware of the purpose for which it provides its details, regardless of the technology.\nFor data protection, it is recommended to use the ITP-SEC020 encryption standards, for ITP-SEC031 transit data.']"	['<urn:uuid:1097389d-4b01-4bb7-ad6a-3d63b7ac37aa>', '<urn:uuid:8ce29e76-ae66-4f7d-aad3-be5ed24d19fd>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	8	117	2182
65	filming techniques used nutcracker 2018 movie	The Nutcracker was filmed using film rather than digital technology, as film is superior for capturing subtleties of color, especially in skin tones and forest greenery. The cinematography was done by Linus Sandgren, and the movie features extensive special effects with an unprecedented budget.	['Interview with Lasse Hallström on A Dog’s Purpose\nBy Scott Holleran\nLasse Hallström recently took a break from work to talk with me about his newest movie, A Dog’s Purpose, in theaters now. Mr. Hallström, whose films range from Dear John and Hachi: A Dog’s Tale to The Cider House Rules, The Hoax and Chocolat, has been directing motion pictures since 1985 with his feature My Life as a Dog. This is his first interview about the picture since A Dog’s Purpose debuted. This is an edited and partial transcript with one minor plot “spoiler”.\nScott Holleran: Congratulations on a commercially successful debut at the box office, where your movie, A Dog’s Purpose, made its money back in one week. Thank you for making an intelligent, wonderful and meaningful motion picture.\nLasse Hallström: Thank you for the lovely review. I really appreciate it. I put a lot of heart into this film and I totally enjoyed the process.\nScott Holleran: Applying the movie’s theme, what are you working on now?\nLasse Hallström: I finished shooting a live action version of The Nutcracker [Disney’s The Nutcracker and the Four Realms] based on the original story by E.T.A. Hoffman in the 1800s—the ballet came out in the late 1800s—which will come out around Thanksgiving 2018. So, now I start editing. It’s a lot special effects. I’ve never had a budget like this before. It was fantastic, not that the budget didn’t weigh on us—it’s a tremendous responsibility. We had a wonderful lead girl named Mackenzie Foy. She played the daughter in Interstellar. I think she’s amazing in it. We have cinematography by Linus Sandgren (La La Land, The Hundred-Foot Journey), music by James Newton Howard (The Hunger Games, Batman Begins, Concussion) and Tchaikovsky and we use the original ballet music. We have Morgan Freeman (An Unfinished Life, Feast of Love), Helen Mirren (Collateral Beauty, The Hundred-Foot Journey) and Keira Knightley (Collateral Beauty). It was a lovely experience.\nLasse Hallström: No. If there’s a [subconscious] choice, I can only say I enjoy making movies that focus on character and what characters have in common—in India, France, or America—I love character observations. So I work with actors to help to create something authentic and recognizable. That’s what drives me really.\nScott Holleran: What technology do you find best helps you achieve the look you want?\nLasse Hallström: That’s a good question. I have a split answer. If I’m egotistical, I would go with the digital system when it comes to capturing performances because I love to improvise especially with dogs in order to keep rolling. But for the artistic look I certainly prefer film. If I want the best and most authentic look, I have to go with film. Subtleties of the skin get flattened out with digital. The greenery of the forest looks very different, too. My cinematographer, Linus Sandgren, who just did La La Land, has taught me the wonderful difference between film and digital and I have to stick to film. Film is superior when it comes to subtlety of color.\nScott Holleran: What one quality did you seek in the actors who played Ethan?\nLasse Hallström: I look at the ability to improvise and be alive in front of the camera. I tend to want to improvise around the script. There’s a lot of improvising. It’s a great asset for me, it’s more vibrant. For example, when [two characters in A Dog’s Purpose] break up, that was all improvised. The scripted version felt a little written. So I used the improvisation.\nScott Holleran: Which scene best essentializes the movie’s theme?\nLasse Hallström: [Pauses] I don’t think I have one. Personally, I like the end shot of Maya [a character played by Kirby Howell-Baptiste] when she pats her dog and says ‘what are you thinking?’ and he says “…one of my best lives, really”. I thought that was the best interaction. I can’t say I have a defining moment.\nScott Holleran: Why did you decide to make another movie about dogs?\nLasse Hallström: It’s coincidence, really. I have to say if I’m offered something with potential charm that’s driven by character and allows for that, I’m undaunted. I like the idea of hearing a dog’s thoughts and trying to get in the head of the dog. I pay more attention to dogs now. I try to figure out what they’re thinking which makes me want to connect with dogs even more. I find that I’m more passionate in wanting to know what’s on a dog’s mind. I think you know about my [having had] five chow chows. I’m a fanatic dog lover. [Pauses] I lost my chow chow right before we started shooting [A Dog’s Purpose]. So, now I just have memories of them.\nScott Holleran: Did you have Dennis Quaid in mind as Ethan?\nLasse Hallström: He was cast very early on. It’s a lead character but I had worked with him before on Something to Talk About. I really love him. We both love dogs and play golf and we’ve worked together before so it was easygoing [on the set]. He’s got a great sense of humor.\nScott Holleran: Did he collaborate with the other actors playing Ethan at earlier ages?\nLasse Hallström: I kind of told him [about the character] and he met and discussed the character with K.J. Apa. I think they decided to have some mannerisms in common, like a little nervous thing with his hand. I trusted him to the point of letting him do whatever he wanted to do including when to tell the cameraman to stop. So we did a lot of takes. I said: here’s the crew, here’s the camera and there’s the crane.\nScott Holleran: Why did you choose Josh Gad (Frozen) as the voice of the dogs?\nLasse Hallström: That was an idea from the studio that I loved. We really hit it off long distance and, with him in Los Angeles and me in London, we kissed and hugged long distance. I still haven’t met him.\nScott Holleran: You chose Rachel Portman, who scored your movies Chocolat and The Cider House Rules, to compose the musical score. Why?\nLasse Hallström: She always delivers. I love what she’s doing and she’s a dog lover, too. She loved the film and was inspired by it, so we had another good experience. She made so many scenes [with her musical score]. It’s a perfect complement to that breakup scene.\nScott Holleran: What’s the most common criticism of the movie which you think might be valid?\nLasse Hallström: I knew it was [going to be] that I’ve been making too many “heartwarming” movies. So, it’s a bit too sweet even for me. It’s the nature of the project. I keep getting attracted to stories that have a certain life-affirming quality. I’m just that kind of guy. I can’t resist charm and life-affirming moments that entertain or, as we say in Swedish, roa röra, a phrase which means entertain and touch or move.\nScott Holleran: What’s the most common praise for the movie that you think might be valid?\nLasse Hallström: The one I pick up on and appreciate is that it’s heartwarming after all. But being drawn to it is crossing the line into sentimentality. I’m actually allergic to sentimentality. But I’m very, very drawn to it, or to the conflicts, because I keep saying that if I’m honest or realistic with wanting to convey strong emotion or sentimentality I can stay on the right side [of the line]. If I’m false or pushy, I can fall into sentimentality. The fact that people are moved by it, not by blatant attempts to push buttons and evoke emotion, may be why the movie earned an A from Cinemascore audiences.\nScott Holleran: Had you seen Frank Marshall’s Eight Below?\nLasse Hallström: No. But Frank Marshall is probably a kindred spirit. He has a positive outlook on life.\nScott Holleran: What did Walden Media add to the movie?\nLasse Hallström: I got to meet them for notes on the edit. But nothing was imposed on us.\nScott Holleran: What did Amblin add to A Dog’s Purpose?\nLasse Hallström: I really enjoyed working with the heads of Amblin, Michael Wright and Holly Bario. I respect them very much. Steven [Spielberg] wasn’t involved very much this time but he liked the final result which is the ultimate reward to me because he is my master.\nScott Holleran: What did Universal add to the movie?\nLasse Hallström: They gave it a fantastic release. They’re the best at releasing and doing publicity from what I’ve been told.\nScott Holleran: Is this the movie you wanted to make?\nLasse Hallström: Yes. There’s nothing I can’t stand for.\nScott Holleran: Had you read W. Bruce Cameron’s book, have you spoken with him and has he seen the movie?\nLasse Hallström: I read it, I met him on set and he likes the film. Expect similarities to the book but also a lot of differences. However, it is heartwarming.']	['<urn:uuid:bf240591-10dc-4db4-b0bd-3905bc265ec3>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	6	44	1506
66	As a geologist studying sustainable mining practices, I'm interested in understanding what minerals are from a chemical perspective and what environmental impacts their extraction has. Could you explain the chemical composition of minerals and their mining's effects on biodiversity?	Minerals are naturally occurring, inorganic solids with fixed chemical compositions and crystalline structures. They can be single elements like gold or compounds made of multiple elements, with specific geometric arrangements of atoms. For example, quartz (SiO2) always has a hexagonal structure due to how silicon and oxygen atoms bond. However, mining these minerals can severely impact biodiversity. It can lead to habitat destruction, wildlife population disruption, and ecosystem damage. Mining requires large-scale deforestation to create space for debris storage, and can cause contamination of soil, groundwater and surface water through chemicals used in mining processes. In some cases, especially in regions like Africa, mining areas are left in such unsustainable conditions that they risk becoming lifeless wastelands, threatening both plant species and wildlife.	"['What’s the Diff? Don’t Gloss Over This Info!\nWhat is a rock? Is it different than a stone? Than a mineral? Are gemstones rocks? Are minerals the same as crystals? Are minerals the same as elements? What is the difference between a precious and semi-precious stone? What is a gem? Rock hounds use a lot of terms that we take for granted folks understand.\nRead the quick glossary below so that you can be one of us (or at least sound like you are :-).\nElements: Elements are the simplest substances and cannot be broken down further using chemical methods. (Elements can only be changed into other elements using nuclear methods – and we don’t want to go there!) Elements are defined by the number of protons they have in their nuclei – their atomic number in that pesky periodic table from 8th grade. There are more than 100 known elements (only 92 of which occur naturally) and, either singly or in combinations, elements make up all known matter. At 75 percent, hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, followed by helium at 23 percent and oxygen at 1 percent. The other elements make up the remaining 1 percent. In the earth’s crust, oxygen (47 %) is the most abundant element, followed by silicon (28 %) and aluminum (8 %). “That’s elementary, my dear Watson”\nMinerals:The term mineral is used to describe a solid material which has a definite, fixed chemical composition. Minerals are homogeneous, naturally occurring, and inorganic solids. A mineral may be a single element such as copper (Cu) or gold (Au), or it may be a compound made up of a number of elements. The specific chemical composition of each mineral translates into a regular geometric arrangement of atoms (its crystalline structure) which results in geometric shapes and regular crystal faces (which are sometimes visible to the naked eye.) For example, a crystal of quartz (SiO2) is always hexagonal because of the way the atoms of silicon and oxygen join together.\nMinerals are not organic – they have never been alive as plants or animals.Neither are minerals man-made substances. Minerals have to be naturally occurring in the universe without us messing with them. We call pieces of minerals “specimens” because every piece of that mineral will have the same chemical composition.\nAbout 2,500 different minerals have been discovered and classified.Telling them apart requires testing them on a series of physical properties: luster, hardness, streak, color, specific gravity (relative density), rupture (cleavage and fracture), transparency, magnetism, and reaction to hydrochloric acid. Good, reliable mining sources that you trust to tell you what it is when you buy it are a great shortcut to all this testing\nCrystals:A crystal is a solid material whose constituent atoms, molecules, or ions are arranged in an orderly, repeating pattern extending in three dimensions. Because all minerals have a fixed chemical composition, they are all crystalline. This means that, grown or evaporated in ideal conditions, all minerals would have perfect crystal forms that we could enjoy with the naked eye. Reality being the bummer that it sometimes is, however, most specimens of minerals are a mish-mash of crystal growths that often look like a blob or lump. When you see a large, clearly formed crystal shape in a mineral specimen, consider yourself lucky and the specimen rare and valuable.\nQuartz is the most common mineral on earth and large, clean crystals of quartz are the most common crystals that folks see and recognize. Think “scepter with a six sided point” (and Dungeons and Dragons!).\nTying back to an earlier newsletter, druzy specimens of minerals are fantastic because they have huge numbers of little tiny crystals, all the same shape, or the mineral on the surface. Not only do you get to see the color clearly, but you also get that added “bling factor of seeing so many tiny crystal faces all aligned.\nRocks: Rocks are made up of one or more minerals. They form in one of three ways: igneous rocks forms from the cooling of molten lava; sedimentary rocks form as layers of accumulated sediments are pressed together over time; and metamorphic rocks form from older parent rocks (either igneous or sedimentary) when they are under intense pressure/heat deep inside the earth’s crust.Because rocks form under rather intense pressure and heat, the minerals that make them up get all jumbled together and don’t usually have a chance to form visible crystals.\nRarely, rocks are made up of only one element.Some lucky leprechauns have found rocks of gold (or silver). Jade and lapis lazuli are also found as rocks. The vast majority of rocks on Earth, however, are made up of combinations of minerals – most including quartz, feldspar, and hornblende.\nThe most embarrassing moment in my academic career happened on a geology fieldtrip. We were spread out in an area working to identify as many rocks and minerals as we could. The professor caught up with me while I was studying a very colorful and visually interesting conglomerate, trying to identify its constituent materials. “You do realize you have been staring at a concrete piling, don’t you?” he asked and walked away with a smirk. Who says that brunettes can’t blush beet red? That you can’t die of mortifaction?\nStone: Stone is a generic term used to describe any of the naturally occurring solid materials which make up the Earth. A stone is a fragment of rock that can be classified by its shape and size. The name stone is typically given to pieces of rock that are the size of gravel, cobbles, or boulders.Stone is not used to describe the really small fragments that make up sands, silts, and clays. However, stone is a term that is not widely accepted in the geological field so it is mostly used as a layman’s term.\nGem/Gemstone/Jewel: A gem is a piece of mineral, which, in cut and polished form, is used to make jewelry or other adornments. While almost all gems are minerals, certain rocks (such as lapis lazuli) and organic materials (such as pearls, amber or jet) are used for jewelry, and are therefore often considered to be gemstones as well. Most gemstones are hard, but some soft minerals are used in jewelry because of their luster or other physical properties that have aesthetic value.\nPrecious or Semi-Precious Gems: Gems are semi-precious or precious based upon their color, availability, and desirability. So, if they are pretty, rare, and everyone wants them, they are precious (read expensive). The four most precious stones are emerald, diamond, ruby and sapphire. Pearls and opals are sometimes included in this category. Interestingly, until they discovered huge Brazilian deposits of it in the 19th century, amethyst was considered precious (and royalty reserved this gem for their use.) Even in the last century certain stones such as aquamarine, peridot and garnet have been rare and popular and therefore been called precious. Currently, the line between these two categories is even blurrier Designers have used the most common gems in their most expensive pieces, and others use forms of the precious gems in costume jewelry. Unlike commodities which the market prices based on supply and demand, art and jewelry set their values with aesthetics and design.', ""Mining has several bad effects. It leaves behind a huge hole after mining is done. Secondly it damages natural beauty. A beautiful landscape which once existed is now a huge piece of dug up earth.\nEnvironmental Effects.

67	How can I check what firewall packets are getting blocked automatically?	You can log dropped packets by adding specific IPTables rules that will write to syslog (/var/log/messages). First create a LOGGING chain using 'iptables -N LOGGING', then add rules to jump packets to this chain, use the limit module to control logging rate, and specify logging parameters like prefix and level. The logs will show details including source IP, destination IP, protocol, ports and interfaces used.	"['This article is part of our ongoing Linux IPTables series of articles. When things are not working as expected with your IPTables rules, you might want to log the IPTables dropped packets for troubleshooting purpose. This article explains how to log both incoming and outgoing dropped firewal packets.\nIf you are new to IPTables, first get yourself comfortable with the IPTables fundamental concepts.\nLog All Dropped Input Packets\nFirst we need to understand how to log all the dropped input packets of iptables to syslog.\nIf you already have whole bunch of iptables firewall rules, add these at the bottom, which will log all the dropped input packets (incoming) to the /var/log/messages\niptables -N LOGGING iptables -A INPUT -j LOGGING iptables -A LOGGING -m limit --limit 2/min -j LOG --log-prefix ""IPTables-Dropped: "" --log-level 4 iptables -A LOGGING -j DROP\nIn the above example, it does the following:\n- iptables -N LOGGING: Create a new chain called LOGGING\n- iptables -A INPUT -j LOGGING: All the remaining incoming packets will jump to the LOGGING chain\n- line#3: Log the incoming packets to syslog (/var/log/messages). This line is explained below in detail.\n- iptables -A LOGGING -j DROP: Finally, drop all the packets that came to the LOGGING chain. i.e now it really drops the incoming packets.\nIn the line#3 above, it has the following options for logging the dropped packets:\n- -m limit: This uses the limit matching module. Using this you can limit the logging using –limit option.\n- –limit 2/min: This indicates the maximum average matching rate for logging. In this example, for the similar packets it will limit logging to 2 per minute. You can also specify 2/second, 2/minute, 2/hour, 2/day. This is helpful when you don’t want to clutter your log messages with repeated messages of the same dropped packets.\n- -j LOG: This indicates that the target for this packet is LOG. i.e write to the log file.\n- –log-prefix “IPTables-Dropped: ” You can specify any log prefix, which will be appended to the log messages that will be written to the /var/log/messages file\n- –log-level 4 This is the standard syslog levels. 4 is warning. You can use number from the range 0 through 7. 0 is emergency and 7 is debug.\nLog All Dropped Outgoing Packets\nThis is same as above, but the 2nd line below has OUTPUT instead of INPUT.\niptables -N LOGGING iptables -A OUTPUT -j LOGGING iptables -A LOGGING -m limit --limit 2/min -j LOG --log-prefix ""IPTables-Dropped: "" --log-level 4 iptables -A LOGGING -j DROP\nLog All Dropped Packets (both Incoming and Outgoing)\nThis is same as before, but we’ll be taking the line number 2 from the previous two examples, and adding it here. i.e We’ll have a separate line for INPUT and OUTPUT which will jump to LOGGING chain.\nTo log both the incoming and outgoing dropped packets, add the following lines at the bottom of your existing iptables firewall rules.\niptables -N LOGGING iptables -A INPUT -j LOGGING iptables -A OUTPUT -j LOGGING iptables -A LOGGING -m limit --limit 2/min -j LOG --log-prefix ""IPTables-Dropped: "" --log-level 4 iptables -A LOGGING -j DROP\nAlso, as we explained earlier, by default, the iptables will use /var/log/messages to log all the message. If you want to change this to your own custom log file add the following line to /etc/syslog.conf\nHow to read the IPTables Log\nThe following is a sample of the lines that was logged in the /var/log/messages when an incoming and outgoing packets was dropped.\nAug 4 13:22:40 centos kernel: IPTables-Dropped: IN= OUT=em1 SRC=192.168.1.23 DST=192.168.1.20 LEN=84 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=64 ID=0 DF PROTO=ICMP TYPE=8 CODE=0 ID=59228 SEQ=2 Aug 4 13:23:00 centos kernel: IPTables-Dropped: IN=em1 OUT= MAC=a2:be:d2:ab:11:af:e2:f2:00:00 SRC=192.168.2.115 DST=192.168.1.23 LEN=52 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=127 ID=9434 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=58428 DPT=443 WINDOW=8192 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0\nIn the above output:\n- IPTables-Dropped: This is the prefix that we used in our logging by specifying –log-prefix option\n- IN=em1 This indicates the interface that was used for this incoming packets. This will be empty for outgoing packets\n- OUT=em1 This indicates the interface that was used for outgoing packets. This will be empty for incoming packets.\n- SRC= The source ip-address from where the packet originated\n- DST= The destination ip-address where the packets was sent to\n- LEN= Length of the packet\n- PROTO= Indicates the protocol (as you see above, the 1st line is for outgoing ICMP protocol, the 2nd line is for incoming TCP protocol)\n- SPT= Indicates the source port\n- DPT= Indicates the destination port.

I followed the instructions exactly, but as per the first comments, the result was that the server would not accept connections, and I had to go to the console and restart iptables so that the new rules were removed.\nCan someone please explain what we’re doing wrong?\nAlso smart to stop the logging in /va/log/messages.\nI think the confusion is because of the statement “If you already have whole bunch of iptables firewall rules, add these at the bottom, which will log all the dropped input packets”. The (unstated) implication is that you already have a whole bunch of rules that ACCEPT connections, and so the suggested rules will log and drop *whatever is left*. That’s why it says “All the remaining incoming packets will jump to the LOGGING chain”. Of course if you only have existing rules that DROP connections (or no rules at all) then the net effect is to DROP everything (!).\n@ Simon Turner\nOr when you have default policy DROP in INPUT chain (like i do)\nI did the same stupidity without thinkind and now my server is down for 30 minutes (i have a cron job to reset iptables to the working one once an hour)\ni think will be better to specify this in article.\nIt only works when the default policy is accept.\nYou have some accept rule and this logging rule acts also as DROP everything else is not covered in rules.\nCan you log other things besides just dropped packets?\nI had to reset the server too, please modify the article or alert people.\nHi, I have a question. Could we log packets which are dropped because of forwarding queue is filled (e.g in congestion time)? How do I perform this work?\nMy default policy for the INPUT chain is DROP. I ran the four commands to log all dropped packets from the INPUT chain. Dropped packets are now being logged.\nOne hint that may help others. Make sure the firewall rules are working rather than just accepting everything. List the rules and make sure pkts are actually hitting any rules in place.\niptables -L –line-number -v\nI need to measure iptables’ latency.\nMy question is: what tools are there to use in order to measure iptables latency (delay when it processes different volumes of traffic) in Linux Debian?\nIs this done before?

I tried the 4th\ncommand as above\niptables -A LOGGING -m limit –limit 2/min -j LOG –log-prefix “IPTables-Dropped: ” –log-level 4\nbut show message as “iptables v1.4.12: no command specified .

But all input log rule shows only 8 packets why ?\nCould you mention which kernel modules are required for logging?\nFor some reason on Ubuntu 14.04 I don’t have a /var/log/messages file\nnot sure where these log statements are going.\nOk, I see it should be in /var/log/kern.log — but I don’t see any dropped packets being logged (on VPS).\nHi, I set logging for All Dropped Input Packets according to your example and I have noticed this in log: IPTables-Dropped: IN=eth0 OUT= MAC=ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:00:04:2e:58:47:ch:08:00 SRC=0.0.0.0 DST=255.255.255.255 LEN=334 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=128 ID=24675 PROTO=UDP SPT=68 DPT=67 LEN=314\nAny idea what is causing this (what is being blocked)?

68	What are some effective ways to prepare both garden compost and outdoor spaces for the winter season to ensure everything stays in good condition?	There are several approaches to manage both compost and garden preparation for winter. For composting, you can create either hot or cold compost piles, use worm farms, or practice chop-and-drop directly in the garden. To protect your garden for winter, it's essential to wrap garden furniture with damp prevention plastic and add silica gel packets, move metal tools and clay pots into protected storage areas, and add ground cover like mulch or straw to protect flower beds. For year-round garden access, you can replace grass with artificial turf or add concrete patios, though these require maintenance to prevent moss and algae growth.	['Composting doesn’t need to be complicated. Sometimes composting just means dropping your harvest waste and trimmings right onto the garden. In permaculture, this is known as chop-and-drop. And it is the simplest and easiest way to get organic matter into the garden.\nIf you want to know how to make the best compost, well, there really isn’t just one way to go about it. So I’ll go through a few different options so you can pick which one works best for you in your situation.\nHow do I compost? Let me count the ways.\nThere really are many ways that you can create excellent compost. From using worms, to cold composting, to hot composting, compost can be done in oh, so many ways.\nHere are a few ways to make compost that don’t involve making big piles and turning them.\nComposting directly in the garden\nYou can put your kitchen scraps directly into the garden. Dig a trench along the edge of the path (if there’s stuff growing in the beds), and bury your compost. This can sometimes create a problem: if it isn’t properly aerated it won’t compost it will just rot, and you’ll have a soggy, stinky mess in there. So make sure to mix it with some carbon (brown) material, and ensure that air can get in there.\nNot every scrap that comes out of the garden goes into the compost pile. Some of it just gets dropped into the garden, to break down and feed the soil in place. This is a perfectly acceptable way to compost. Sometimes.\nIf you are in a heavy slug area like I am, chop and drop in the garden could be the equivalent of building luxury slug hotels. They do love to have a nice covered area to stay cool and hide out from the gardener.\nSo while this can be a quick and easy way to keep the garden waste in the garden, it is not always the best choice. I do it in the hot summer months, when the slugs don’t seem to visit much; but I’ll stop doing it as fall approaches and the cooler weather puts out the call for the slugs to attack.\nAnother way to compost directly in the garden – and something I want to try this year – is to build worm towers. These are basically just buckets or large diameter pipes with holes drilled into the sides and bottom. They are then mostly buried into the garden, and the worms and compost materials are dropped inside.\nThe worms stay in the tower, if you use true compost worms, and the goodness created by their worm castings makes its way into the surrounding soil. Plus you get the bonus of pulling out some castings if you want to, and using them elsewhere.\nOur compost and garden have quite a good worm population, so I think I will try it first without buying and adding true compost worms, just to see what happens. Adding some manure in there will probably help to attract them.\nI’m going to place a few towers around the garden, and observe how the plants nearest to the tower fare. I’m thinking they’ll like the boost. I’ll be doing this experiment this summer in the garden, and will add a link here to the write up of my observations.\nIf you like things really tidy, you can purchase a store bought compost bin. These come in all shapes and sizes, from tumbling barrels, to stationary upright barrels.\nYou can also build compost bins out of wood scraps. Used pallets seem to be a popular choice, but you can really use anything, as long as it’s not treated wood.\nWorm farms are another way to take care of your garden scraps, and feed the soil. You can either have a worm farm in a bathtub, or a fancy store bought worm farm. And worm farms are a great way to compost your kitchen scraps if you live in an apartment. You can get a small worm farm!\nEven if you don’t have a garden, you can use the worm castings for your potted plants. You can also just take it outside and add it to any flower gardens in your area. Or you could take it to a friend who gardens. Just another way apartment dwellers can contribute to creating healthy soil!\nFor our home compost, we make a circle out of chicken wire and layer it with compost materials. It’s quick and easy. I suggest attaching the ends together with something that is easy to undo; then, when you want to take the compost out you just open up the wire and there’s your compost. Then you can put the wire cage back together and refill it with your turned compost.\nAnd of course, if you have lots of waste and resources to use, you can just make a big ol’ pile or windrow. But on this small property, there really isn’t a place to do that. That’s more for doing on a larger property, and for people who have equipment large enough to turn a big pile.\nI generally do a combination of chop-and-drop and chicken wire composting. Some garden trimmings just get dropped on the beds to act as mulch, and decompose in place. But I also do bulk composting, using natural resources that we gather hither and yon. If I had (or when I have) my own property, I would like to have a series of wooden bins, so I can turn the compost from one bin to the next, and when it gets to the end, it’s done!\nThen again, if (when) I have my own property, I will have lots of chickens, and they will do a large portion of my composting for me! Gotta love chickens.\nHot or Cold Compost\nThere are two kinds of compost piles: a hot compost pile and a cold compost pile. A hot compost – also known as the Berkley Method (developed at the UofC in Berkley) – is one that is piled up and left to heat up, then is turned, left to heat up, turned again, etc. Here is Geoff Lawton once again, showing us how to build a hot compost.\nA cold compost pile is built up in the same way, but it is not turned as many times; and sometimes not at all. Our compost piles here are basically cold compost piles. But I am going to do some turning here at the end of their life cycle, to finish them off, in anticipation of gardening season!\nThere are advantages to both systems – hot or cold compost – and it really depends on your space, time, and ability to actually turn a big pile of compost material every three days for two weeks.\nFinding compost resources\nWe love our compost around here. Finding natural resources to put into our compost piles is a game we love to play. There are lots of trails and cutlines in the area that offer access to all kinds of goodies, and we’re always on the lookout.\nWe found some old, breaking down piles of wood chips at an old sawmill, which were a great treasure! We’ve put it through the composting process, used it as fill behind the rock wall we built, and put it into the garden as paths or used it as fill around the edge where the trees are.\nAnother resource that we’ve decided to use is the discarded peat moss and perlite that pot growers take out and dump in the bush. I just can’t let that precious resource go to waste! It gets rained on quite a bit, rinsing it of any linger fertilizer; and then we put it through the composting process. I think that this will make it safe to use in the garden.\nThe third resource we’re excited about is elk manure. The area where I live hosts a fairly substantial elk population – although I’ve never actually seen one yet – and they kindly leave their droppings lying around for us to find. It’s like the poop version of an Easter egg hunt!\nThe dog gets exercise, we get exercise, and strange as it may seem, it’s kinda fun. I wish we had kept track of how much elk manure we’ve brought home; but suffice to say that it plays a major role in our many compost piles. You could also gather deer manure, which we often find. What animals live in your area that you could follow behind and clean up after?\nAnd there’s also seaweed, which brings many trace minerals with it, so it’s great to add to the compost. We haven’t collected a ton of seaweed, but we pick up a bucket or two now and then.\nBecause each of our compost piles was created at a different time, each contains a different mixture of ‘stuff’. Some was started when there was a lot of green waste coming out of the garden, and some contains only elk manure, peat moss, some kitchen scraps, and maybe a little seaweed. But they all also have urine poured on them (we both pee in jars).\nLayering the browns with the greens, we fill up a wire cage, and then move on to the next. We have filled 12 in the last 6 months or so, ranging from 3 to 4 feet across, and 3 to 4 feet tall.\nIt’s March now, and I’m taking the chicken wire off all the piles and mixing them together into one big windrow. Some are fresher than others, so I’m going to mix it up, cover it, and then turn the windrow a few times before it goes on the garden.\nFinal thoughts on composting\nHere’s what I have to say about composting:\nAs you can see, I can’t really tell you how to make the best compost, as it really depends on where you live, what you’re growing, and what resources you have to use. But if you make no compost at all, and you’re a gardener, you’re missing out on some of the best soil food for your garden. And a healthy soil, makes healthy food.\nThere are many ways to compost. But the best way to compost, is the way that works for you, and is appropriate for your garden and climate. So just do it. If it’s too difficult or complicated, you’re not likely to keep it up; so keep it simple.\nFor a healthy, soil feeding compost, diversity is key. The more different components you can add to your compost the better it will be, because each ingredient in the compost will bring with it its own microbes, bacteria, minerals, and other bits and bobs, and that will just make the mix stronger.\nSo take a look around your place, your neighborhood – wherever you go – and see what you can find. Then let me know what interesting ways you’ve discovered to find compost materials, or to set up composting bins, buckets, barrels, or piles in general. We can all learn from one another.\nHealth, Hope & Happiness', 'With summer almost out the door and autumn on the horizon, our gardens are slowly going to fall out of use as the air turns colder and we are less likely to enjoy sitting outdoors unless you have a patio heater or chiminea for warmth. Not only does it close of your garden for use, but if you are someone with a pet you might be half dreading the winter months as they start to bring in the dirt, mud and leaves from the garden on their trips outdoors.\nHere we’ve got some tips to winterise your garden and ensure its low maintenance and ready to enjoy once the spring rolls around in the New Year;\nWrapping Up Your Garden Furniture\nIf you’ve got nice garden furniture, you might be worried about it getting affected by damp during the cold, wet months and you might not have the available storage to bring it indoors. Damp prevention plastic is available to wrap outdoor soft furnishings with and for extra protection, silica gel packets are available cheaply through several online retailers. Silica gel packets are used by companies around the world to prevent their goods getting damaged during transit on aeroplanes, boats and in trucks so a few should be fine to protect your garden goods.\nProtecting Exposed Flower and Food Beds\nFor the flower boxes or raised planters in your garden, they aren’t likely to have a lot of ground cover over the winter. You can move planters into greenhouses or cover with plastic greenhouses but for extra protection against dry beds, especially when growing hardy vegetables over winter like kale, beets and cabbage, use some type of extra ground cover. This could be mulch, planting covers, shredded leaves or straw to name a few cost-effective options.\nReplace the Dirt with an All-Season Friendly Option\nShould you wish to make use of your garden all-round without getting bogged down by damp grounds and muddy patches, there are several options to replace your grass with year-round friendly alternatives. For a tidy, grass alternative, an artificial turf is a low-maintenance option with plenty of varieties available to choose from to suit your tastes for a lush, green garden. Click here for a project planner that helps you work out how much you would require for the size of your garden.\nAlternatively, patio or concrete offers an option that allows all year access, although does require more maintenance to ensure it stays safe and clean for use; a pressure spray or stiff brush for removing moss and algae growth and anti-slip additions like tape or etched surfacing.\nMove Fragile Items and Garden Tools into Storage\nThere are plenty of garden tools that don’t want to be left out over the winter months for fear of rusting and frost damage. Make sure to move all metal tools into indoor storage areas like sheds and utility rooms and put some dehumidifier pots around the room if you are concerned about damp making its way in. Clay pots should also be moved into protected areas as they are susceptible to temperature changes and lead to chips and cracks which shorten their lifespans.\nYour garden has offered you plenty of enjoyment over the summer, so it makes sense to protect it during the winter months. These tips can be utilised in addition to moving fragile plants into indoor pots, taking any soft furnishings or textiles indoors for storage and covering or applying winter coverage measures to wooden and wicker garden furniture. Be being prepared and acting now while the daily temperatures still hold some warmth, it may even prevent you having to spend a lot of money in the spring when you want to start preparing your garden for use again.']	['<urn:uuid:a4357f50-f342-41f1-a5ba-d54cb59a02bf>', '<urn:uuid:85bba3db-4581-4da6-89b6-f84007257481>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	24	102	2485
69	historical developments sugar trade impact ottoman world war 1 period parallels global power shifts	During the early 20th century, both the Ottoman Empire's involvement in World War I and the global sugar trade represented significant shifts in world power dynamics. The Ottoman Empire's entry into WWI in 1914, triggered by the unauthorized bombardment of Russian ports, led to its eventual dismemberment and the reshaping of Middle Eastern territories. Concurrently, the sugar trade was transforming global power structures through the European colonization system. Sugar production had already established new patterns of international trade and power relations, particularly through the Triangular Trade system and forced labor. Both developments involved European powers exerting increasing control - militarily in the case of the Ottoman Empire's defeat, and economically through sugar production and trade networks. These parallel developments contributed to significant changes in global power distribution and the formation of modern political boundaries and economic systems.	['The centenary of the Ottoman entry into the First World War\nAyşe Gülnev Osmanoğlu\nOttoman mariners are seen on board the Yavuz (Goeben) battlecruiser. In 1914, the Ottoman Empire acquired the Yavuz and its sister ship the Midilli, the two German-origin ships that bombarded Russia and took the Ottomans into World War I.Today marks the centenary of the Ottoman Empire’s official entry into World War I. It was today, 100 years ago, that the Russian ports of Sevastopol and Odessa were bombarded by ships of the Imperial Ottoman Navy, under the command of Admiral Wilhelm Souchon. This episode marked the first engagement in World War I by the Ottoman Empire, and remarkably it was carried out without the authorization or knowledge of Parliament, the Cabinet or even the Palace.\nA few days later, on Nov. 1, 1914, Russia declared war on the Ottoman Empire, followed by her Allies of the Triple Entente, Britain and France, on Nov. 5, 1914. The war would ultimately lead to the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire, the abolition of both the Ottoman sultanate and caliphate and the subsequent exile of the imperial family. It would lead to the creation of the Turkish Republic and to the divided and troubled Middle East that exists today. It would also lead to a tragic number of deaths among the Ottoman civilian population, along with the deaths of over three quarters of a million Ottoman soldiers and a similar number of Ottoman military wounded. Was war inevitable? Could the empire have remained neutral, or at the very least a non-belligerent nation?\nDid Britain and France provoke and manipulate the Empire into war by requisitioning the Empire’s new battleships and refusing to discuss an alliance with all Ottoman diplomats during the summer of 1914?\nADMIRAL WILHELM SOUCHON\nWhatever the truth, the result was that the Ottoman Empire entered the theatre of the First World War on Oct. 29, 1914. It was a step that was to have catastrophic consequences for the empire, the sultanate, the caliphate and for the people in Ottoman lands. All the political and diplomatic intrigue behind the reasons for and causes of the Ottoman Empire’s entry into World War I are of course interesting to debate and to consider, but they are not important today.\nAyşe Gülnev Osmanoğlu is married to British businessman Nicholas\nSutton.

It provides information about world history, how it reached the modern world, how the six plants had impact on the history of human behaviours, especially sugar. The aim of this essay is to discuss the seed of change by Hobhouse. This essay will focus on the origin and the spread of sugar then move to the history and the impact the spread of sugar had in the modern world and the influence sugar had on the creation of Natal’s history.\nDefinition of Sugarcane and Sugar\nSugar cane is an enduring plant that flourishes well in places or areas situated next to the tropics that needs high temperatures which can be the sunlight, rich soil, and a large amount of water. Sugar is a sweet substance which comes from sugar cane after it has been refined therefore it can be regarded as an end product of sugar cane. The quinine, sugar, tea, cotton, the potato and cocoa were the plants that Hobhouse believed that they introduced change in human behaviour and brought change in the world’s history. Sugar was one of the plants that had a enormous impact in the creation of the modern world and had a significant role of introducing change in world’s history and had an impact on the creation of Natal’s history.\nThe Origin and the Spread of Sugar\nSugar cane was first invented in three different countries which are, Polynesia where it was first established, and it then spread to Indonesia and the New Guinea moving westerly from the Pacific Ocean. It was often used in India and China therefore as it was found that sugarcane was firstly refined at Bihar on the Ganges in India and thence presented as sugar to China. A various number of canes were used for Indian sugar therefore which was particularly called the Puri and this diverse number of canes was the reason why sugar escalated gradually to the eighteen century therefore the New World and it was by the time western Europe was starting to utilize it. The role of honey was more like sugar when sugar cane was not yet refined, and it believed that it was first established in Egypt. “Sugarcane was unknown in the New World until Columbus introduced it on his second voyage in 1493.” This had a major impact on the usage of sugar in Europe as it resulted to more consumption and more to marketing.\nIn 1319 was the time sugar had finally reached England then Denmark in 1374 and in 1390 it also reached Sweden and it was very expensive during this time because it was used in different products one of them is medicine, it was used making herbs, entrails and other remedy substances of the medieval periods as there was a lot of illnesses during this era.\nSugar and honey were one of the most expensive products in the middle ages but as time went by they decreased in their prices because of a large amount of cane that was being produced in the cane industries. When they both decreased in prices, this gave chances for the availability on European market of sugar grown from canes outside Mediterranean.\nIn Portugal canes were planted in the Azores, Madeira and Sao Tome therefore expanding the number of canes and they were the first to come up with the use of slaves from outside Europe. In Spain they planted their plants in Canary Islands therefore which are in the West coast of Africa. The islands had all the characteristics that sugar canes and other plants required for them to grow on a right scale. The sugar industries were gaining more in Spain and Portugal, they used debtors, the African slaves, and Jews who resisted being converted to Christianity as their workers. Sugarcane was spread across the world as some of the workers that were taught how to manage plants were sent across Atlantic and used in the Americas on their larger numbers.\nThe Impact the Spread of Sugar Had in The Modern World\nSugar had quite a lot of effect in the making of the modern world therefore if looking at how the world is today and things that occurred due to sugar, you can tell that it had an impact. Slavery and slave trade are one of the effects of the modern world as there was a number of sugarcane industries that were introduced in different regions of Europe. All the industries relied much more on slaves for them to grow a surplus and for Europeans to make a good living out of it, through trade and as a result this led to slave trade. The trade of African slaves was one of the most transportation of foreigners in world history, which took place due to the sugar industries that needed more workers.\nIt was better known as the trans- Atlantic Triangular trade in African slaves and the Triangular Trade basically refers to the trade between African, America, Europe, and other European Caribbean colonies. It was divided into three, they were goods which were traded from Europe to Africa in exchange for slaves, African slaves that were traded to the Caribbean and American plantations and America returned/traded raw materials like sugarcane back to Europe.\nIt had an effect on Africa as many people were forced to migrate from Africa to America therefore to work on sugarcane plantations and there was a enormous number of Africans that were treated unfairly therefore abused in any other way that you can think of and killed during this era. Most of the slaves underwent depression on the sugar industries and this resulted to them rating themselves as people who were not vital enough in the world and also led to a formation of classes between whites and blacks.\nSugar also decreased the population for Africans therefore by trading the people to America through forced labour therefore of which this left their homelands with no developments and had to face difficulties as a number of them were traded and the those who were let suffered from the whites colonizes. The economy was not in a good state as productive adults were taken from their homelands and this led to civil wars that provided more opportunities for trading of slaves and Europeans were also developing thoughts that they were more different to Africans and those thoughts were propelling them to be racist.\nThe European colonization is another effect in the making of the modern world. The colonization by Europeans was therefore encouraged by sugar as they saw that it was making a good profit and highly required or needed through out the whole world. “When they first encountered sugarcane and learnt how to make sugar and forged the link between the sugar industry and Europeans colonialism that has endured until our times.” It was originally started by Portuguese and the Spanish followed them, but they were both were leaders that introduced sugar production at Europe and then the rest followed.\nThis also helped the Europeans to also practice their cultures in Africa as Christianity was introduced and more people were converted, and some had to follow the Moslem. Europe gained a lot from the triangular traded as they were able to take over and rule many regions therefore as they are still the region that is ruling worldwide. They also succeeded in their capitalist system as the world nowadays is using this type of economic system.\nAnother effect are health risks that were caused by over consumption of sugar. When people consumed a lot of sugar that could likely have diabetes, tooth decay, malnutrition from processed sugary foods and for others to be obese.\nThe Influence Sugar Had on The Creation of Natal’s History\nAccording to Freund “The history of Indian workers in and around Durban is crucial to the understanding of the history of Natal and Durban as local economy in particular.” The Indians had a larger population that was a threat for Europe and they acted as the hinders which hindered the whites to do a cheaper labour economy that will encourage skilled workers and owners.\nThe abolition of slaves and slave trade led to the introduction of a new system which is better known as the Indentured Labour System which refers to agreements made by employers that they will pay the employees, when they are employing them, it included quite a number of Indians migrating from India to Natal therefore to work in industries, one of them being sugarcane industries and just for them to gain profit and make a living out of it. It was not like slavery whereby slaves were forced to do a certain job that they are required to do without any agreements made and without no profit in return.\nThe British settlers from Mauritius are accountable for spreading sugarcane to the tropical climate of Natal in 1850s. According to Freund on a passage from India, “In Mauritius, the indenture system was introduced as early as 1834 therefore almost after the abolition of slavery while Natal began to import indentured labour from India in 1860.” The indenture labour lasted for about 3 – 5 years in and while they were payed inadequate salaries by their employers but the this was used by British to as part of a problem solving plan for rural overpopulation and poverty and they made the labourers look as if they were supported while they were not, some faced complexities with climate but were still under the cruel social system.\nIn 1860 the first indentured labourers landed into Natal, followed by the first stage which was in between 1860-1866 and second stage was in 1874-1911. In the first indentured labourers, they were exceeding 150,000 that were transported from India. Most of the indentured workers were not treated well therefore their working conditions were to bad as they had to face being treated cruel and there was to much loss of life for Indians.\nThere was time by which the Indians outnumbered the British, so they had to use race in order to win against them and so as a resulted some Indians ended up going back to India while others were suffering from free labour that was introduced after indenture labour system.\nIt is fair to conclude by saying this essay has discussed the seed of change by Hobhouse. It also focused on the origin and the spread of sugar then move to the history and lastly the impact the spread of sugar had in the modern world and the influence sugar had on the creation of Natal’s history. Taking into account, you can tell that sugar really had an impact in Natal’s history and Durban as a whole and therefore all the resources we have in nowadays were due to sugar especially sugarcane.\n- Henry Hobhouse.

70	hot water tank advantages safety issues	Direct hot water tanks are simple and straightforward to install, while indirect systems offer dual heating sources for reliability. However, both systems pose safety concerns - tanks without proper covers can lead to unclean water, and water temperatures between 20-45°C can support growth of dangerous Legionella bacteria that cause Legionnaires' disease through inhaling water droplets.	['Many of us turn on our hot tap with little thought of what it takes to supply that hot water. The route that the water takes and the way in which it is heated are dependent on several factors but they are broadly categorised as direct and indirect systems. There are advantages and disadvantages to each. Both will supply hot water, but in different ways. You may also have heard the terms ‘vented and unvented systems which we shall look at as well.\nWhat is a Direct Hot Water Cylinder?\nA direct hot water cylinder is one in which cold water is fed in, then heated directly by an electric element (an immersion heater) . This hot water is then fed directly from the tank to the hot tap. The simplest of these systems is a vented system. As the water is heated, the water pressure and the pressure of the adjacent air will rise, and that pressure must be allowed an escape route for safety reasons. In a vented system, that escape rout is via a pipe which leads back up to the cold water tank in the loft.\nIn an unvented system, there is no open pipe to take the excess pressure. Instead, the system is kept constantly full with an expansion vessel dealing with the rise in pressure.\nRelated Post: How Does an Immersion Heater Work\nDirect Hot Water Cylinder Advantages And Disadvantages\nThe main advantage of a direct system is its relative simplicity, particularly if it is of the vented variety. It is also more straightforward to install than some other types of heater. If it is an immersion heater, then it can be a source of hot water even if the boiler is not working and can draw power from clean energy sources such as solar panels.\nThe main disadvantage is that the water tank may need to be heated from cold which can be time consuming and use quite a lot of electricity. In addition, water storage itself can give rise to bacterial growth if the thermostat is not set to a high enough temperature, which is obviously undesirable in water used for washing. It can also be a potential problem if the same water is used for washing and the domestic heating system, as radiators are prone corrosion, which will end up in the water tank.\nWhat is an Indirect Hot Water Cylinder?\nIn an indirect water heater the water in the cylinder is heated by a coil which in turn is heated directly from the boiler. While these cylinders can also be fitted with electric elements as back up, the prime source of heat energy is the gas boiler. What this means is that the hot water which circulates in the central heating system never comes into direct contact with the water in the cylinder, hence the term ‘indirect’.\nIndirect Hot Water Cylinder Advantages and Disadvantages\nIn the case of indirect water heaters, the hot water coil which heats the water in the cylinder , is fed with hot water from the boiler.Because this water is separate from the water in the hot water cylinder, it follows that any contaminants such as rust particles, which will inevitably be shed by the radiators, can never end up in water which is used for washing. The hygiene advantage is obvious. There is also the advantage that even if the electrical power fails, an indirect cylinder will continue to supply hot water, since the boiler is gas powered.\nThe bonus with indirect cylinders is that should the boiler need to be switched off for maintenance or servicing, the electric heating element can still be used to heat the water in the tank. In the case of both types of water heater, good insulation around the water tank and associated pipework will maximise the efficiency of the process.\nOf course, there is never a perfect solution, and this is particularly true in the plumbing world! The main disadvantage of an indirect hot water cylinder is its relative complexity. This means that installation can be more costly than the direct type of heater due to the necessity of allowing for both electrical and gas fired heat sources. And it also follows that the more complex something is, the greater that the range of potential problems that will go with it is.\nWhich is Better?\nAs usual when this question is asked of two different types of heating equipment, the answer is it depends. Both will supply you with hot water, but how they do so is the real issue here.\nWith the direct system, the advantage of relative simplicity is certainly worth having. It does mean however, that there is only one method of heating the water in the tank. Should the power supply be interrupted, for whatever reason, you could be left with no means of supplying hot water until it has been restored.\nIt may be that the property has no domestic gas supply, in which case a direct hot water cylinder is going to be fitted anyway. This is particularly true of rural properties where it would be uneconomical to lay a gas main. Even if this is not the case, it is fair to say that the direct water heating system takes up relatively little space and is easier to install.\nIn the case of indirect hot water cylinders, the issue of its relative complexity is certainly there, but it is largely negated by the reliability of modern heating components. Regular boiler servicing will greatly reduce the chance of a problem further.\nWhere indirect hot water cylinders score points, is the fact that they rely on two separate sources of energy to heat the water, so if one is out of use, the other can do the job. While the boiler and pipework will take up more space, they provide the security of knowing that hot water will be there when it is required. In addition, with the hot water in the heat exchanger coil never coming into contact with the water in the tank, no cross contamination between heating water and washing water can take place.\nAssuming access to a gas main, the indirect hot water cylinder is the more versatile choice.\nYou may also like our guide to the Best Instant Water Heater', 'There are a number of important Health and Safety matters which must be considered when undertaking a Survey. Obviously gas and electrical safety are well known issues and it is likely that water safety will become more important over coming years.\nIt is often the case that cold water header tanks (often located in the loft) have no covers or poor covers and as a result it is highly likely that many older water heating systems will have unclean water in the hot tanks.\nThe age and condition of cold tanks is covered in our house and flat Surveys. We look at the adequacy of the support for tanks, the covers, lagging and overflow pipes.\nThere are also risks of Legionnaires disease in some properties and it is important that facilities such as spa baths be sterilised and flushed using hot water on a regular basis.\nThe following information was taken from the Health and Safety Executive Website. See:\n‘Legionellosis is a collective term for diseases caused by legionella bacteria including the most serious Legionnaires’ disease, as well as the similar but less serious conditions of Pontiac fever and Lochgoilhead fever. Legionnaires’ disease is a potentially fatal form of pneumonia and everyone is susceptible to infection. The risk increases with age but some people are at higher risk including:\n- people over 45 years of age\n- smokers and heavy drinkers\n- people suffering from chronic respiratory or kidney disease\n- diabetes, lung and heart disease\n- anyone with an impaired immune system\nThe bacterium Legionella pneumophila and related bacteria are common in natural water sources such as rivers, lakes and reservoirs, but usually in low numbers. They may also be found in purpose-built water systems such as cooling towers, evaporative condensers, hot and cold water systems and spa pools.\nLegionella bacteria are widespread in natural water systems, e.g. rivers and ponds. However, the conditions are rarely right for people to catch the disease from these sources. Outbreaks of the illness occur from exposure to legionella growing in purpose-built systems where water is maintained at a temperature high enough to encourage growth, e.g. cooling towers, evaporative condensers, hot and cold water systems and spa pools used in all sorts of premises (work and domestic).\nPeople contract Legionnaires’ disease by inhaling small droplets of water (aerosols), suspended in the air, containing the bacteria. Certain conditions increase the risk from legionella if:\n- the water temperature in all or some parts of the system may be between 20-45 °C, which is suitable for growth\n- it is possible for breathable water droplets to be created and dispersed e.g. aerosol created by a cooling tower, or water outlets\n- water is stored and/or re-circulated\n- there are deposits that can support bacterial growth providing a source of nutrients for the organism e.g. rust, sludge, scale, organic matter and biofilms’\nIn light of the above and other possible water-related health problems it is important to maintain and improve the water pipes leading into the house, internal fixtures and fittings etc.\nCareful attention must be paid to water storage tanks and any old tanks will probably need to be replaced. Spa baths present a particular risk and it is important that such fittings but also showers be regularly flushed with very hot water. It is also possible to arrange for a water system to be sterilised by a qualified plumbing contractor who has the experience and qualifications to sterilise a water system.']	['<urn:uuid:eb0cef75-2bb4-4898-b08c-66f91959b637>', '<urn:uuid:a461f60a-d9eb-434a-943f-e244c3201b4c>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	6	55	1629
71	how does oil from dough affect conveyor maintenance and what temperature controls are needed for worker safety	Oil saturation from bread dough causes significant maintenance issues on conveyor lines, requiring daily washdown and maintenance checks. The oil can cause belt stretch and tracking problems, particularly on dough-divider and inclined discharge conveyors. This leads to considerable downtime for washing, re-tensioning, and tracking the belt. Regarding temperature control for worker safety, when the environment becomes too hot, the body must work harder to maintain its normal internal temperature of 37°C. The body does this by pumping more blood to the skin and increasing sweat production. When the heat gain exceeds heat loss capacity, body temperature rises, potentially leading to heat illnesses. Therefore, proper temperature control is essential, as most people are only comfortable when air temperature is between 20°C and 27°C with relative humidity between 35-60%.	"['Oil saturation from bread dough necessitates daily washdown and routine maintenance checks on the conveyor lines. On dough-divider, inclined discharge conveyors, for example, oil can cause belt stretch and tracking problems.\n""Automated processing lines in bakeries should run like well oiled machines; sometimes they become a little too well oiled,"" says an engineer at the Interstate Brands Corp. bakery in St. Louis. ""Considerable downtime to washdown, re-tension and track the belt robs us of expensive production time.""\n""Our belting supplier, Midwest Industrial Rubber Inc., Hilliard, OH, worked with us on the ultimate solution,"" continues the Interstate engineer. ""First, the solid woven belt was replaced with a reinforced PVC belt. Since the belt change, and the switch to quick release take-ups, we have virtually eliminated unscheduled interruptions, and reduced sanitation washdown time by more than 75%."" To see a diagram of how the take-up configuration changed, click here.\nThe bread making process at the St. Louis bakery starts with mixing a 500-lb dough-sponge for four minutes at 74°F. Next, the dough is placed in a fermentation trough for three hours at 80°F and 75% humidity. Then the batched dough ball is sent to a divider which slices off predetermined sized pieces of dough for single loaves.\nThe dough pieces are moved on the PVC conveyor belt to a conical rounder. The dough receives a five minute intermediate proof, then passes through two cross-grain moulders and a curling chain into 4- or 5-strap pans. Line speeds are 150 loaves per minute.\nAfter receiving a 60-minute proof at 115°F dry and 112°F wet in a traveling tray proofer, the bread bakes for 18 minutes at 425°F before depanning and traveling to a ceiling cooler for 62 minutes. The loaves then pass through a slicer/bagger and an inkjet printing system that prints price, code date and price per pound on the bag.\nActive area concerns\n""Obviously, each step in the production process is critical to maximize throughput,"" states the engineer. ""However, in active areas where production equipment is running constantly, unscheduled downtime must be kept to a minimum. The mixer-to-conveyor-to-rounder is a key active area. Reducing maintenance needs, and the time it takes to clean the various components in this area, was a prime target for efficiency improvements.\n""For example, during a typical washdown procedure, conveyor belts are slackened so that 100% of the underside area of the belt can be cleaned and/or sterilized. Before, the final washdown step was repositioning pulleys, and refastening take-up devices, then tinkering and jogging to assure proper belt tracking.\n""Now, we simply release the take-up\'s toggle clamp, move back the pulley to slacken the belt and prop up the belt so that sanitation personnel can clean under it. Once the washdown is complete, we remove belt props, move the pulley into position and reclamp the take-up to its original position. The take-up always returns to the original tension and tracking setting so there is no need for time-consuming tension and tracking tinkering.""\nKey to the Quick Release Telescoper\'s performance is a patented, easy to operate, lock/release, pull-action toggle clamp that eliminates all pulley and belt tracking adjustment required. These take-ups are ideally suited for application on both new conveyors and for retrofit.\nUsing this Telescoper, releasing the toggle clamp allows belt slack, but does not disturb the Telescoper\'s take-up position. After the washdown cycle is complete, relocking the clamp resets take-up and tracking to the previous and correct position. All Telescoper take-ups feature a threaded adjuster rod totally enclosed in a stainless steel tube, protected from product build-up, rust, corrosion and thread damage.\nIn many applications, up to 90% time and labor savings are possible during belt washdown and maintenance activities. In addition to baking, applications include: poultry, fish, meat and food processing, beverage bottling and unit handling, among others.\nBryant Products, Inc., P.O. Box 270, Ixonia, WI 53036.

For example:\n- In foundries, steel mills, bakeries, smelters, glass factories, and furnaces, extremely hot or molten material is the main source of heat.\n- In outdoor occupations, such as construction, road repair, open-pit mining and agriculture, summer sunshine is the main source of heat.\n- In laundries, restaurant kitchens, and canneries, high humidity adds to the heat burden.\nIn all instances, the cause of heat stress is a working environment which can potentially overwhelm the body\'s ability to deal with heat.\nMost people feel comfortable when the air temperature is between 20°C and 27°C and when the relative humidity ranges from 35 to 60%. When air temperature or humidity is higher, people feel uncomfortable. Such situations do not cause harm as long as the body can adjust and cope with the additional heat. Very hot environments can overwhelm the body\'s coping mechanisms leading to a variety of serious and possibly fatal conditions.\nThis OSH Answers document contains information about the health effects of hot environments. Please see Hot Environments - Control Measures for information about the prevention and control for heat exposure.\nHow does the human body react to hot environments?\nThe healthy human body maintains its internal temperature around 37°C. Variations, usually of less than 1°C, occur with the time of the day, level of physical activity or emotional state. A change of body temperature of more than 1°C occurs only during illness or when environmental conditions are more than the body\'s ability to cope with extreme heat.\nAs the environment warms-up, the body tends to warm-up as well. The body\'s internal ""thermostat"" maintains a constant inner body temperature by pumping more blood to the skin and by increasing sweat production. In this way, the body increases the rate of heat loss to balance the heat burden. In a very hot environment, the rate of ""heat gain"" is more than the rate of ""heat loss"" and the body temperature begins to rise. A rise in the body temperature results in heat illnesses.\nHow does the body control heat gain and heat loss?\nThe main source of heat in normal conditions is the body\'s own internal heat. Called metabolic heat, it is generated within the body by the biochemical processes that keep us alive and by the energy we use in physical activity. The body exchanges heat with its surroundings mainly through radiation, convection, and evaporation of sweat.\nRadiation is the process by which the body gains heat from surrounding hot objects, such as hot metal, furnaces or steam pipes, and loses heat to cold objects, such as chilled metallic surfaces, without contact with them. No radiant heat gain or loss occurs when the temperature of surrounding objects is the same as the skin temperature (about 35°C).\nConvection is the process by which the body exchanges heat with the surrounding air. The body gains heat from hot air and loses heat to cold air which comes in contact with the skin. Convective heat exchange increases with increasing air speed and increased differences between air and skin temperature.\nEvaporation of sweat from the skin cools the body. Evaporation occurs more quickly and the cooling effect is more noticeable with high wind speeds and low relative humidity. In hot and humid workplaces, the cooling of the body due to sweat evaporation is limited because the air cannot accept more moisture. In hot and dry workplaces, the cooling due to sweat evaporation is limited by the amount of sweat produced by the body.\nThe body also exchanges small amounts of heat by conduction and breathing. By conduction, the body gains or loses heat when it comes into direct contact with hot or cold objects. Breathing exchanges heat because the respiratory system warms the inhaled air. When exhaled, this warmed air carries away some of the body\'s heat. However, the amount of heat exchanged through conduction and breathing is normally small enough to be ignored in assessing the heat load on the body.\nWhat are the effects of heat on the body?\nWhen the air temperature or humidity rises above the range for comfort, problems can arise. The first effects relate to how you feel. Exposure to more heat can cause health problems and may affect performance.\nAs the temperature or heat burden increases, people may feel:\n- Increased irritability.\n- Loss of concentration and ability to do mental tasks.\n- Loss of ability to do skilled tasks or heavy work.\nIn moderately hot environments, the body ""goes to work"" to get rid of excess heat so it can maintain its normal body temperature. The heart rate increases to pump more blood through outer body parts and skin so that excess heat is lost to the environment, and sweating occurs. These changes place additional demands on the body. Changes in blood flow and excessive sweating reduce a person\'s ability to do physical and mental work. Manual work creates additional metabolic heat and adds to the body heat burden. When the environmental temperature rises above 30°C, it may interfere with the performance of mental tasks.\nDoes everyone react to heat the same way?\nThe risk of heat-related illness varies from person to person. A person\'s general health influences how well the person adapts to heat (and cold).\nThose with extra weight often have trouble in hot situations as the body has difficulty maintaining a good heat balance. Age (particularly for people about 45 years and older), poor general health, and a low level of fitness will make people more susceptible to feeling the extremes of heat.\nMedical conditions can also increase how susceptible the body is. People with heart disease, high blood pressure, respiratory disease and uncontrolled diabetes may need to take special precautions. In addition, people with skin diseases and rashes may be more susceptible to heat. Other factors include circulatory system capacity, sweat production and the ability to regulate electrolyte balance.\nSubstances -- both prescription or otherwise -- can also have an impact on how people react to heat.\nThe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) reports that several studies comparing the heat tolerances of men and women have concluded that women are less heat tolerant than men. While this difference seems to diminish when such comparisons take into account cardiovascular fitness, body size, and acclimatization, women tend to have a lower sweat rate than men of equal fitness, size and acclimatization. This lower sweat rate means that there can be an increase in body temperature.\nWhat are the illnesses caused by heat exposure?\nHeat exposure causes the following illnesses:\nHeat edema is swelling which generally occurs among people who are not acclimatized to working in hot conditions. Swelling is often most noticeable in the ankles. Recovery occurs after a day or two in a cool environment.\nHeat rashes are tiny red spots on the skin which cause a prickling sensation during heat exposure. The spots are the result of inflammation caused when the ducts of sweat glands become plugged.\nHeat cramps are sharp pains in the muscles that may occur alone or be combined with one of the other heat stress disorders. The cause is salt imbalance resulting from the failure to replace salt lost with sweat. Cramps most often occur when people drink large amounts of water without sufficient salt (electrolyte) replacement.\nHeat exhaustion is caused by loss of body water and salt through excessive sweating. Signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion include: heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, visual disturbances, intense thirst, nausea, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle cramps, breathlessness, palpitations, tingling and numbness of the hands and feet. Recovery occurs after resting in a cool area and consuming cool drinks (e.g., water, clear juice, or a sports drink).\nHeat syncope is heat-induced dizziness and fainting induced by temporarily insufficient flow of blood to the brain while a person is standing. It occurs mostly among unacclimatized people. It is caused by the loss of body fluids through sweating, and by lowered blood pressure due to pooling of blood in the legs. Recovery is rapid after rest in a cool area.\nHeat stroke is the most serious type of heat illness. Signs of heat stroke include body temperature often greater than 41°C, and complete or partial loss of consciousness. Sweating is not a good sign of heat stress as there are two types of heat stroke - ""classical"" where there is little or no sweating (usually occurs in children, persons who are chronically ill, and the elderly), and ""exertional"" where body temperature rises because of strenuous exercise or work and sweating is usually present.\nHeat stroke requires immediate first aid and medical attention. Delayed treatment may result in death.\nWhat are symptoms and first aid steps for heat exhaustion?\nSymptoms of heat exhaustion may start suddenly, and include:\n- Nausea or irritability.\n- Muscle cramps or weakness.\n- Feeling faint.\n- Heavy sweating.\n- High body temperature.\nFirst aid for heat exhaustion includes:\n- Get medical aid. Stay with the person until help arrives.\n- Move to a cooler, shaded location.\n- Remove as many clothes as possible (including socks and shoes).\n- Apply cool, wet cloths or ice to head, face or neck. Spray with cool water.\n- Encourage the person to drink water, clear juice, or a sports drink.\nWhat are the symptoms and first aid steps for heat stroke?\nHeat exhaustion may quickly develop into heat stroke. Symptoms of heat stroke include:\n- Hot, dry skin or profuse sweating.\n- Loss of consciousness.\n- Very high body temperature.\nFirst aid for heat stroke includes:\n- Call 911 immediately. Heat stroke is a medical emergency.\n- Stay with the person until help arrives.\n- Move to a cooler, shaded location.\n- Remove as many clothes as possible (including socks and shoes).\n- Wet the person\'s skin and clothing with cool water.\n- Apply cold, wet cloths or ice to head, face, neck, armpits, and groin.\n- Do not try to force the person to drink liquids.\nWhat are the illnesses caused by long-term (chronic) heat exposure?\nNIOSH reports that certain heart, kidney, and liver damage are thought by some researchers to be linked to long-term heat exposure. However, the evidence supporting these associations is not conclusive.\nChronic heat exhaustion, sleep disturbances and susceptibility to minor injuries and sicknesses have all been attributed to the possible effects of prolonged exposure to heat.\nHeat exposure has been associated with temporary infertility in both women and men, with the effects being more pronounced in men. Sperm density, motility, and the percentage of normally shaped sperm can decrease significantly when the temperature of the groin is increased above a normal temperature. Workers exposed to high heat loads should inform their family doctors of their exposure.\nLaboratory study of animals has shown that exposure of the pregnant females to high temperatures may result in a high incidence of embryo deaths and malformations of the head and the central nervous system (CNS). There is no conclusive evidence of teratogenic effects of high temperatures in humans. The NIOSH criteria document (Draft: 2013) recommends that a pregnant worker\'s body temperature should not exceed 39-39.5°C during the first trimester of pregnancy.\n(Reference: Criteria for a Recommended Standard: Occupational exposure to heat and hot environments. Revised Criteria 2013. Cincinnati, Ohio: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Draft, 2013)\nWhat are some of the terms used in this document (Glossary of Terms)?\nAcclimatization - Physiological changes which occur in response to several days of heat exposure and make the body accustomed to a hot environment.\nConvection - Process of heat exchange between the body and the surrounding air or fluid as a result of bulk flow of that air or fluid.\nDehydration - Loss or deficiency of water in body tissues caused by sweating, vomiting or diarrhea. Symptoms include excessive thirst, nausea, and exhaustion.\nHeat cramps - Painful and often incapacitating cramps in muscles. Heat cramps are caused by depletion of salt in the body as a result of heavy sweating, and ingestion of water without replacing salt.\nHeat exhaustion - Weakness, lassitude, dizziness, visual disturbance, feeling of intense thirst and heat, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, tingling and numbness of extremities after exposure to a hot environment.\nHeat rash (prickly heat or milliaria) - An itchy rash of small raised red spots on the face, neck, back, chest and thighs caused by a hot and moist environment.\nHeat strain - Physiological and behavioural responses of the body as a result of heat exposure.\nHeat stroke - Acute illness caused by overexposure to heat. Symptoms are dry, hot skin, high body temperature (usually over 105F) and mental dysfunction.\nHeat syncope - Temporary loss of consciousness induced by insufficient flow of blood to the brain. Recovery is normally prompt and without any long-term ill effects.\nMetabolic rate - Rate of energy (heat) production of the body which varies with the level of activity.\nNatural Wet Bulb Temperature - Air temperature measured using a thermometer in which the bulb is covered with wet cotton wick and cooled by the natural movement of air.\nNausea - The feeling that one is about to vomit as experienced in seasickness.\nPrickly heat - See Heat rash.\nRadiation (heat) - Transfer of heat between hot and cold bodies without contact between them.\nRelative humidity - The ratio of the water vapour content of air to the maximum possible water vapour content of air at the same temperature and air pressure.\nAdd a badge to your website or intranet so your workers can quickly find answers to their health and safety questions.\nAlthough every effort is made to ensure the accuracy, currency and completeness of the information, CCOHS does not guarantee, warrant, represent or undertake that the information provided is correct, accurate or current.

72	silica sand basic chemical formula	The chemical formula for silica is SiO2, which is a combination of Silicon and Oxygen elements	['Silica Sand is actually a granular material. It contains quartz and minute amounts of coal, clay. Sometimes it has minerals in it. People call it quartz sand too. Most importantly it is the industrial sand. Quartz over time turns into Silica sand gradually because of the influence of water and wind.\nYou have to use it when gradually it breaks into tiny granules. Silica sand or industrial sand is actually a type of high purity quality Silica Sand products. But it is actually sized controlling the material. It is not like common concrete and asphalt gravels.\nSources of Silica Sand\nThe chemical sign of Silica is SiO2. It is actually the group of minerals which is a mixture of Silicon and Oxygen. It is often got in the crystalline state. Because of weathering, plankton fossilization happens and that results in crystallizing SiO2.\nThese are found as mines in most regions of the world. It is got in high hardness. Good Silica Sand Crystal depends more on the hardness ratio, silica ratio and chemical structure of mines. Silica sand is mostly used as wet and dry in the industry. The sources of Silica sand have a wide variety. These are yellow, beige and white in color.\nUses of Silica Sand\nYou can use Silica Sand in many sectors and that too in a very indescribable way. It is usually used as a raw material in most of the construction industry. It can be used both as dry and wet. Sometimes it is used as filtration sand, molding sand and in glass production. If you think about industrial and manufacturing applications then deposits of silica yielding products of at least 95% SiO2 is preferred. Silica has a high melting point. It is hard. SiO2 is used for industrial sand’s strength. In every industrial sector, silica sand is a very important element.\nFlowings are the major fields where we see uses of silica sand:\n- For Glassmaking\n- Metal Casting\n- Metal Production\n- Paint and Coating\n- Filtration and Water Production\n- Oil and Gas Recovery\nBrief descriptions of these uses are given below:\nIn glassmaking, the primary component is silica sand. Silica sand is used for all types of glass whatever the standard and specialty are. Every glass formulation needs its basic component. Silica sand has clear and strong chemical purity. Glass making cannot be possible without the help of silica sand. It is the primary determinant of color. Industrial Sand is used for producing flat glass for automotive and building use. In Foods, beverages and tableware containers production, it is also used. Silica Sand is needed for the production of fiberglass insulation. It reinforces glass fibers. It is also used in test tubes and other scientific tools.\nFor the ferrous and nonferrous foundry industry, industrial sand is the most important part. the clay is molded to achieve the external shape. Metal parts are cast into the sand. Core sands can be mechanically recycled to produce new cores or molds. Metal parts need SiO2 for their strength.\nAll those soap and dye productions are made from Silica Sand. The main ingredient of chemicals like Sodium silicate, silicon tetrachloride, silicon gels is silicon sand. These chemicals are used to produce household and industrial cleaners.\nFor all those wide varieties of building and construction products, Silica Sand is the primary component for it. Ground Silica works as a functional extender to add durability and anti-corrosion. For epoxy-based compounds, sealants and caulks it works like magic. In flooring compounds, mortar, cement, stucco, roofing shingles, and asphalt mixtures, whole grain silica sand is used. It affects the chemical properties of the binding system.\nPaint and Coating\nTo improve the appearance and durability of any kind of architectural and industrial paint and coatings, Silica Sand is used. Paint formulators always select micron-sized industrial sands. High purity silica is able to contribute critical performances in properties like brightness and reflectance, color consistency and oil absorption. It is also used in architectural paints. Silica fillers are able to improve tint retention, durability, and resistance to dirt, mildew, cracking and weathering. Low oil absorption always allows increased pigment loading and improves finish color.\nFiltration and Water Production\nFor the filtration of drinking water, the processing of wastewater, the production of water from wells, Silica Sand is used. Silica gravel is something that is used as packing material in deep water wells. Grain size distributions are also very necessary for efficient filtration bed operations.\nOil and Gas Recovery\nSilica Sand is known as Frac Sand in the oil industry. Silica’s hardness is important here. The chemical purity in Frac Sand is able to attack in the corrosive environment. Whole grains deposits of Frac sand is able to attack in the corrosive environment. Whole grains deposit of Frac Sand is able to maximize formation cuttings.\n- What is sand?

73	us export control laws main regulations purpose	US export control laws serve to protect national security, meet foreign policy goals, and prevent sensitive items from reaching restricted entities. There are two main regulatory regimes: The Export Administration Regulations for commercial and dual-use items, administered by the Department of Commerce, and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations for defense articles, managed by the Department of State. Additionally, the Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control oversees regulations for sanctioned countries and entities. These laws require licenses for certain exports based on end-use and end-user, with current priorities focusing on preventing sensitive US technologies from reaching adversaries, particularly China and Russia.	['Segev Shani (firstname.lastname@example.org) is Chief Compliance & Regulatory Officer at Neopharm Ltd., Petach Tikva, and Senior Lecturer at the Department of Health Systems Policy & Management & School of Pharmacy at Ben-Gurion University in Beer Sheva, Israel.\nInternational trade laws include export controls, economic sanctions and embargoes, customs and import controls, and antiboycott requirements. These are used by national governments and international organizations throughout the world to safeguard national security, prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, support foreign policy objectives, protect economic security interests, ensure the public’s health and safety, and meet other standards.\nInternational trade requirements touch almost every organization that buys or sells products, services, software, or technical data from/to other countries. Every such organization must conduct its business in full compliance with all domestic and international trade laws and regulations; failure to meet these obligations may result in significant civil and criminal penalties, disrupt business initiatives, delay fulfillment of on-time deliveries to customers, and damage the organization’s reputation.\nThe aim of this article is to describe international trade requirements and the processes to be implemented by an organization in order to assure trade compliance. To manage supply chain compliance requirements efficiently and effectively, organizations need not only the knowledge, access to information, and ability to interpret the impact of existing compliance requirements, but they must also have the capability to adapt to new and rapidly emerging requirements.\nExport and import controls\nExport controls are rules that restrict the export of products, services, and information, depending on their type, use, and destination. The objective of US export regulations is to protect US national security, meet its foreign policy goals, and prevent diversion of sensitive products or technical data. The outcome of these export regulations is several lists defining restricted countries and entities.\nCompanies must understand whether the products they export are subject to US export control laws, because those exports could require government-issued licenses—depending on the products’ “end use” or “end user”—before they may be shipped abroad. In those situations where an export license is required, the company cannot send the product (or any associated technical data) abroad or otherwise share the product with non-US persons until and unless the appropriate authorization has been obtained from either the U.S. Department of State or the U.S. Department of Commerce.\nUS export control laws prohibit any involvement of a US person or support from the US in a sale to an embargoed country. The US also may impose separate technology controls on sales to embargoed countries of products that incorporate US origin goods or are developed with US technology or other assistance.\nTwo principal US regulatory regimes govern the export of products and technology:\nThe export of items or technologies that are either commercial or “dual-use” in nature is subject to the Export Administration Regulations, administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security. Dual-use items have a predominant commercial purpose, but they can be adapted for military purposes.\nThe export of defense articles and related technical data (i.e., items or technology that are “inherently military” in nature, as well as most space-related items) is subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, administered by the U.S. Department of State Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.\nMoreover, the U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control administers regulations governing the export of items involving countries subject to sanctions or embargoes or certain blocked named persons or entities. The anti-boycott laws and regulations are intended to prevent US companies from taking action in support of a boycott imposed by a foreign country upon a country that is friendly to the US. In general, the anti-boycott laws prohibit US firms and persons from providing information concerning business relationships with a boycotted country, in a boycotted country, or with a company in a boycotted country. Any agreements or transactions seeking to discriminate or actual discrimination against other persons based on race, religion, sex, national origin, or nationality are prohibited.\nThe company should consider that it may be subject to additional various trade sanctions imposed by the United Nations, the European Union, the US, and any other countries in which it does business. Therefore, the company should be able to perform a screening of customers in a database containing numerous blacklists of all different origins.\nLastly, based on the agreed Incoterms, local import laws should be taken into account as well—whether the product requires an import license or any other regulatory or governmental license or approval for entering the territory it is shipped to.', 'US Commerce Department Highlights Export Control Enforcement Priorities\nThe Biden Administration’s national security priorities center on “out-competing China and constraining Russia” according to Matthew S. Axelrod, Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement at the US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), who recently spoke at an event hosted by the Society for International Affairs. He further stated BIS’s singular mission is “to enforce the nation’s export laws in order to prevent the most sensitive US technologies from falling into the hands of our adversaries.”\nIn his remarks, Assistant Secretary Axelrod laid out three criteria the Office of Export Enforcement (OEE) is using to track and prioritize enforcement cases in order to focus on the areas of highest national security concerns:\n- Criticality of the technology: OEE is coordinating with licensing officers across the US government to determine the highest-priority items on the Commerce Control List (CCL) with a primary focus on technologies that could contribute to foreign advisory’s military outcompeting the United States. These efforts also look to identifying technologies with military applications or those that could facilitate human rights abuses.\n- The end users of most concern: Enforcement actions are focused on military, intelligence and security end users in China, Russia, Iran, and other countries of concern.\n- The end uses of most concern: OEE is focusing on the misuse of dual-use technology in nuclear weapons, missiles, chemical and biological weapons, advanced conventional weapons, and human rights abuses.\nAssistant Secretary Axelrod also acknowledged the broader policy changes undertaken by BIS over the past year, including the export control restrictions imposed by the United States and its allies aimed at degrading Russia’s military capabilities, and the issuance of several Temporary Denial Orders (TDOs) against Russian, Belarussian and Iranian airlines, which are discussed in our previous Advisories. He also noted that BIS has a “significant number of ongoing investigations related to Russia.” As an example of such effort, he pointed to a recently unsealed indictment charging individuals and companies for violating US export controls laws by attempting to smuggle a jig grinder to Russia, which is discussed in our previous post. Assistant Secretary Axelrod also emphasized the new controls focused on restricting the use of US technology in China’s military modernization, such as the new controls on semiconductor and supercomputer items destined to China and the changes to the policy around the end-use checks and Entity List, which are also discussed in our prior Advisory.\nAssistant Secretary Axelrod also highlighted the changes made to BIS’s administrative enforcement tools back in June 2022, which include:\n- Imposition of higher penalties for more serious administrative violations: BIS is actively applying the mitigating and aggravating settlement guidelines found in Supplement No. 1 to Part 766 of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to categorize cases as “egregious,” opening the door for more severe penalties. BIS hopes to create a “level playing field” for companies with effective export controls compliance programs by aggressively imposing penalties on those that disregard the rules for an economic advantage.\n- Elimination of “No Admit, No Deny” Settlements: In order for companies and individuals to take advantage of a reduced penalty in settlement actions, they must admit to the underlying factual conduct. Previously, companies and individuals could resolve allegations against them through settlements with BIS without admitting to their conduct. BIS expects this change will help companies “have a clear sense of what the company or individual did that got them into trouble” and “modify their own behavior accordingly.”\n- Non-Monetary Settlement Agreements: BIS has been entering into non-monetary settlement agreements with companies and individuals when the relevant case rises above the level of a no-action letter or warning letter but is not considered “egregious.” For such cases, BIS is requiring remediation through “suspended denial order with certain conditions, such as training and compliance requirements.”\n- Amended Voluntary Self-Disclosure (VSD) Process: BIS is fast-tracking VSDs with minor or technical infractions and issuing warning letters or no-action letters within 60 days of a company’s or individual’s final submission. Conversely, this allows BIS to more actively scrutinize VSDs with potentially more serious violations.\n- Public Charging Letters: Pursuant to a final rule effective as of June 2, 2022, charging letters are made public once filed with an Administrative Law Judge rather than after the matter is resolved. Pre-charging letters remain private. This policy change furthers BIS’s intent to “give the export community—and the wider world—visibility into what types of violations we see occurring and what we’re doing about them.”\nBased on these policy changes and continued use of export control restrictions, companies and individuals should take stock of BIS’s enforcement priorities.\n* Junghyun Baek contributed to this Advisory.

74	Do Des canyons aux étoiles and Serenade for String Orchestra have similar duration?	No, they have quite different durations. Des canyons aux étoiles has a total time of 100:06 (about 100 minutes), while the Serenade for String Orchestra lasts approximately 30 minutes for a complete performance.	"['Olivier Messiaen: Des canyons aux étoiles (From the Canyons to the Stars). Tzimon Barto (piano). John Ryan (horn), Andrew Barclay (xylorimba), Erika Ohman (glockenspiel), London Philharmonic Orchestra, Christoph Eschenbach (conductor). (LPO – 0083 [2 CDs]). Total Time: 100:06\nBy Paul E. Robinson\nDIGITAL REVIEW — There are birds all around us, and many of them make the most extraordinarily beautiful sounds. Over the centuries, composers have been fascinated with birdsong and some were moved to incorporate it into their music; for example, Vivaldi in his Flute Concerto “Il gardellino” and Beethoven in his “Pastoral” Symphony. In the 20th century, Stravinsky composed Chant du rossignol (Song of the Nightingale) and Respighi added the recorded “live” song of a nightingale to the slow movement of his Pines of Rome.\nFrench composer Olivier Messiaen (1908-92), however, surpasses all others with his near-obsession with birdsong, which is a major element in his little-known orchestral work, Des canyons aux etoiles, composed in 1971-74 after a visit to Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah. A rare opportunity to hear the work in concert will occur when the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival presents “the largest-ever ensemble gathered for one performance at the Festival” under New York Philharmonic music director Alan Gilbert on Aug. 23. For information, go here.\nBirdsong was one of the elements frequently used by Messiaen in his compositions. The average listener will have a tough time identifying any particular birdsong when listening to Messiaen, because he almost never transcribed exactly what he heard in nature. Instead, he filtered birdsong through his imagination and invariably came up with something far removed from the original.\nI recently visited the Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland exhibition at the Harry Ransom Center in Austin, Tex., and among the fascinating items on display was an edition of Alice in Wonderland with illustrations by Salvador Dali. Lewis Carroll chose John Tenniel to do the illustrations for the first edition in 1865, and they were quite realistic — if one can use that word to describe any of Carroll’s projects — while Dali’s graphics were surreal. That word surreal comes to mind when attempting to describe how Messiaen made the leap from hearing birds in the wild to actually putting musical notes on paper. Readers and music-lovers interested in the process used by Messiaen to do this can check actual examples here.\nMessiaen’s Catholicism also influenced his music. Awed by the sights and sounds of Utah, he not only notated the birdsongs, but also took away with him impressions of the beauty and variety of nature and even more meaningfully, perhaps, a sense of the all-encompassing power of the Creator.\nDes canyons aux étoiles, he said, is “above all a religious work, a work of praise and contemplation.” One does not have to share Messiaen’s religious beliefs to marvel at the extraordinary music he created. Des canyons aux étoiles is endlessly fascinating for its unique instrumental colors and sound impressions that linger in the memory.\nThe orchestration is very unusual. There are 13 strings, quadruple woodwind, triple brass, and dozens of percussion instruments. There are even a wind machine and a sand machine (géophone), the latter instrument created just for this piece, according to Messiaen’s instructions. It is a flat drum, filled with beads, imitating the sound of moving sand. Finally, there are prominent solo parts for piano and horn.\nAlthough Des canyons aux étoiles is performed infrequently, there have been some excellent recordings over the years. Esa-Pekka Salonen led a performance with the London Sinfonietta (1988; Sony M2K 44762), and Myung Whun Chung conducted the French Radio Orchestra recording about 15 years later (2003; DG 471 617-2).\nChristoph Eschenbach, conductor of this new recording, earned his Messiaen spurs with performances of the Turangalîla-symphonie all over the world. While music director of the Houston Symphony, he played the piano part in a recording of the Quartet for the End of Time (1999; Koch 3-7378-2). About 10 years ago, I attended a mesmerizing performance of Messiaen’s two-piano masterpiece, Visions de l’Amen, by Eschenbach and Tzimon Barto in Philadelphia.\nEschenbach superbly paces Des canyons aux étoiles, a long and demanding work, ensuring that all details are in place. Barto masters the fiendish demands of the piano part, while maintaining sensitivity in the delicate passages. Hornist John Ryan and his colleagues in the London Philharmonic play with unremitting concentration and virtuosity.\nIt could be argued that a piece inspired by the vast outdoors of Utah would best be served by an audio quality long on reverberation, with a sense of distance. From that perspective, this live recording from the Royal Festival Hall in London is a little dry and clinical, but I did enjoy the amazing clarity of detail.\nPaul E. Robinson is a Canadian conductor and broadcaster, and the author of four books on conductors. He writes regularly about music for www.theartoftheconductor.com, www.musicaltoronto.org, and www.scena.org.', 'Serenade for String Orchestra\nThe Serenade is scored for violins I, violins II, violas, cellos, and double basses. In the score Tchaikovsky noted: ""The larger number of players in the string orchestra, the more this shall be in accordance with the author\'s wishes"".\nMovements and Duration\nThere are four movements:\n- I. Pezzo in forma di sonatina. Andante non troppo—Allegro moderato (C major, 295 bars)\n- Ii. Valse. Moderato. Tempo di Valse (G major, 223 bars)\n- Iii. Elegia. Larghetto elegiaco (D major, 162 bars)\n- Iv. Finale (Tema russo). Andante—Allegro con spirito (C major, 406 bars).\nA complete performance of the Serenade lasts approximately 30 minutes.\n""No sooner had I begun to spend a number of days relaxing, than I began to feel somewhat restless and rather unwell... Today I could not bear it, and endure it no longer, and I busied myself a little with designs for a future symphony—perhaps? I immediately began to feel cheerful, well and relaxed ... This effect proved not to diminish itself with time, and I satisfied my intrinsic need to work—especially composition. Now here I am already with designs for a symphony or string quartet; I do not yet know which"", Tchaikovsky told Nadezhda von Meck on 9/21 September 1880 . He also wrote to Anatoly Tchaikovsky on 21 September/3 October 1880 that he had: ""started to write something"" . By 25 September/7 October three movements of the new work were ready .\nIn a letter to Nadezhda von Meck of 25 September/7 October, Tchaikovsky described his new work as a suite for string orchestra. On 6/18 October in a letter to Anatoly Tchaikovsky he reported: ""I\'ve done quite a lot recently. I\'ve already written the overture for the exhibition , and also written and should finish off a Serenade for string instruments"" . ""I am now gradually orchestrating it"", we read in a letter to Nadezhda von Meck of 8/20–10/22 October 1880, and later: ""The Serenade... I composed from an innate impulse; that is something which arises from having freedom to think, and is not devoid of true worth"" .\nBy 14/26 October the Serenade was ready, and Tchaikovsky set to work on its arrangement for piano duet , which according to the date on the manuscript was completed on 23 October/4 November 1880. Despatching the score and piano duet arrangement to Pyotr Jurgenson to be published, Tchaikovsky wrote: ""I happened to write a Serenade for string orchestra in four movements, and am sending it to you the day after tomorrow in the form of a full score and four-hand arrangement ... I love this Serenade terribly, and fervently hope that it might soon see the light of day"" .\nAs noted above, Tchaikovsky\'s arrangement of the Serenade for piano duet (4 hands) was made between 14/26 October and 23 October/4 November 1880.\nThe Serenade was performed for the first time on 21 November/3 December 1880 at a private concert in the Moscow Conservatory by a force of professors and students, as a surprise for Tchaikovsky, who was visiting after long absence from the Conservatory .\nOn 17/29 June 1881, Tchaikovsky wrote to Eduard Nápravník, asking if the Serenade might be included in one of the future concerts . In his reply of 27 June/9 July that year, Nápravník agreed to perform the Serenade in one of the forthcoming concerts .\nThe first public performance of the Serenade for String Orchestra took place in Saint Petersburg on 18/30 October 1881, at the third symphony concert of the Russian Musical Society, conducted by Eduard Nápravník. In Moscow it was performed for the first time on 16/28 January 1882 at the seventh concert of the Russian Musical Society, conducted by Max Erdmannsdörfer.\nOther notable early performances include:\n- Tiflis, 2nd Russian Musical Society symphony concert, 27 March/8 April 1884, conducted by Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov\n- New York, Academy of Music, Symphony Society concert, 12/24 January 1885, conducted by Leopold Damrosch\n- Saint Petersburg, Philharmonic Society concert, 5/17 March 1887, conducted by Tchaikovsky (2nd and 3rd movements only)\n- Hamburg, 6th Philharmonic Society concert, 8/20 January 1888, conducted by Tchaikovsky\n- Prague, National Theatre, 9/21 February 1888, conducted by Tchaikovsky\n- Paris, Colonne Orchestra concert, 16/28 February 1888, conducted by Tchaikovsky (2nd and 3rd movements only)\n- Paris, 16th Châtelet concert, 21 February/4 March 1888, conducted by Tchaikovsky\n- Paris, 17th Châtelet concert, 28 February/11 March 1888, conducted by Tchaikovsky (2nd and 3rd movements only)\n- London, Saint James\'s Hall, 2nd Philharmonic Society concert, 10/22 March 1888, conducted by Tchaikovsky\n- Berlin, Philharmonic Society concert, 14/26 February 1889, conducted by Tchaikovsky\n- Geneva, New Theatre, 25 February/9 March 1889, conducted by Tchaikovsky\n- Kiev, 1st Russian Musical Society symphony concert, 21 October/2 November 1889, conducted by Aleksandr Vinogradsky\n- Tiflis, special Russian Musical Society symphony concert, 20 October/1 November 1890, conducted by Tchaikovsky\n- Baltimore, Lyceum Theatre, 3/15 May 1891, conducted by Tchaikovsky\n- Warsaw, 2/14 January 1892, conducted by Tchaikovsky (2nd and 3rd movements only)\n- Brussels, 2/14 January 1893, conducted by Tchaikovsky (2nd and 3rd movements only)\n- Odessa, Slavonic Society free concert, 22 January/3 February 1893, conducted by Tchaikovsky (2nd movement only)\n- Kharkov, 2nd Russian Musical Society symphony concert, 14/26 November 1893, conducted by Ilya Slatin (2nd movement only)\nSergey Taneyev assisted Tchaikovsky in correcting the score for publication . In January 1881 the full score and parts of the Serenade were printed and issued by Pyotr Jurgenson, and the following April the composer\'s arrangement for piano duet was published.\nThe full score of the Serenade was published in volume 20 of Tchaikovsky\'s Complete Collected Works (1946), edited by Ivan Shishov, and Tchaikovsky\'s arrangement for piano duet in volume 50Б (1965), edited by Irina Iordan.\nTchaikovsky\'s manuscript score and arrangement for piano duet are preserved in the Glinka National Museum Consortium of Musical Culture in Moscow (ф. 88, Nos. 82 and 83).\nIn the Serenade\'s finale, the opening Andante section includes the folksong \'On the Green Meadow\' (А как по лугу), and the main theme of the ensuing Allegro is the folksong \'Under the Green Apple Tree\' (Под яблонью зеленою).

75	Who had a longer sports career, Joe Nuxhall or Ethel Smith?	Joe Nuxhall had a longer sports career. He began in Major League Baseball at age 15 in 1944 and continued playing until 1966, followed by a broadcasting career until his death in 2007. While Ethel Smith's career length is not explicitly stated, we know she competed in the 1928 Olympics and the documents don't mention her continuing competitive career beyond that point.	"['Hall of Famer\nInducted in 1955\nMember,\'Matchless Six\', Canada’s first women’s Olympic track team\nGold medal, 4 x 100m relay, Olympic Games\nBronze medal, 100m race, Olympic Games\nThe year 1928 was a monumental one in sport for women. Despite much public protest over the unladylike deportment of female athletes, as well as numerous allegations about the unhealthy consequences of vigorous physical activity on the female body, women were permitted to compete in track and field at the Amsterdam Olympics that year. No Olympic team made a better case for the tremendous ability of women athletes than the ""Matchless Six,"" Canada first and most famous female track team. The six women were successful in a number of events, but their crowning moment came when four of the six members--Bobbie Rosenfeld, Myrtle Cook, Ethel Smith, and Jane Bell--took the gold medal in the 4 x 100m relay race. Though they were not all well acquainted before the Games, these four women had similar sporting backgrounds. Growing up in and around Toronto, they had all been active in athletics throughout their youth, and each showed significant talent in a wide variety of sports. Ethel Smith was born in Toronto in 1907. At the age of 14, she quit school and went to work in order to help support her family. A versatile athlete, Smith eagerly took part in her company\'s baseball, basketball, and track and field teams. She and Cook had also competed at the Millrose Games in New York, and always returned home with diamond medals. The 1928 Olympic trials in Halifax drew the most talented female athletes from across the country. Cook, Rosenfeld, Smith, and Bell were pitted against each other in the 100m race. Smith won the first heat, Cook the second, and Rosenfeld the third. In the finals, Cook set a world record of 12.0 seconds. All four were chosen for the Olympic team, along with champion high-jumper Ethel Catherwood and 800m runner Jean Thompson. The Matchless Six was born as was a new era in Olympic sports. Until this time, Smith, Bell, Cook, and Rosenfeld had competed against each other, but never as a team. Luckily, they had a ten-day boat journey across the Atlantic to practice and perfect their baton passing. Before working together, however, Cook, Rosenfeld, and Smith were opponents once more in the 100m event. With a world record to her name, Cook was the gold-medal favourite in Amsterdam, but she was disqualified after two false starts. Rosenfeld and Smith raced on. Smith claimed the bronze medal, while Rosenfeld and American sprinter Betty Robinson were so close at the finish line that the judges were divided over who had actually broken the tape. After much contestation, the gold medal was awarded to the American, while Rosenfeld took a respectable silver. During the preliminary heats for the 4 x 100m relay, Rosenfeld, Smith, Bell, and Cook easily took the lead and finished the course in a record time of 49.4 seconds. The finals brought tremendous hopes for a gold medal for Canada as these four women took their places at the starting line. Rosenfeld, the lead runner, took a false start at the beginning of the relay but broke away cleanly with the starting pistol the second time around. She quickly established a lead for the Canadians before passing the baton to Smith. Smith sped around the course and handed it to Bell, who steadily increased their lead. Cook, the anchor of the team, was still slightly shaken from her failure in the 100m event. When Bell approached for the pass, Cook took off a little too quickly, and was almost out of the passing zone by the time Bell caught up to her with the baton. Though she teetered on the edge of disqualification once more, Cook managed to make a clean pass, and fully redeemed herself as she increased the Canadians\' lead and crossed the finish line a full five metres ahead of the second place team. To add to their golden triumph, these four women finished the course in a record time of 48.4 seconds, bettering their previous record by almost a full second. To cap off their success, teammate Ethel Catherwood claimed the gold medal in the high jump, while Jean Thompson took fourth place in the 800m race. With two gold medals, a silver, a bronze, and 26 points in total, they had the top women\'s score at the Games, making the Matchless Six one of the most successful Canadian Olympic teams in history. Upon their return to Canada, these Olympic champions were greeted by more than 200,000 adoring fans at Toronto\'s Union Station, and the ensuing four-mile procession through the city was equally celebratory. Their achievements not only brought tremendous international recognition to Canada but helped to break down gender barriers in the athletic world and forge a new era in women\'s sport. Several members of the mighty Matchless Six remained advocates for women\'s participation in sport the rest of their lives. Bell went on to pursue a career in physical education, sharing her passion for sport with the next generation of female athletes. Both Rosenfeld and Cook enjoyed successful careers in sports writing, using their positions to help promote women\'s sports. Cook became known as ""Canada\'s First Lady of Sport,"" while Rosenfeld was voted Canada\'s female athlete of the half-century in 1950. The pioneering efforts of these remarkable women opened a whole new world for female athletes, while their achievements continued to amaze and inspire.', 'A Brief History\nOn March 22, 1997, figure skater Tara Lipinski, age 14, became the youngest skater ever to win a World Championship. (Okay, she was actually 14 years and 9 months old for you nitpickers.) Prior to her history making performance at the World competition, Tara had won the United States National Championship and in 1998 would go on to win the Gold Medal at the Winter Olympic Games. Lipinski is only 1 of many young athletes who have excelled beyond their seemingly tender years, and today we list 10 such young athletic stars that strike us as particularly worth noting. Many teens have made their way into the Major Leagues of baseball and have competed as Olympic athletes, but some sports have limited the age of professionals to a minimum of 18 years old, making really, really young stars impossible. Some young athletes have even lied about their age in order to compete at a higher level. So many are worth mentioning! As always, feel free to mention other notable people that should be on this list.\nQuestion for Students (and others): Who is your favorite young athletic star? Please let us know in the comments section below this article.\n1. Tara Lipiniski, World Champion Ice Skater, age 14.\nOf Polish heritage (you may have guessed from her last name), Lipinski was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1982. Her early childhood was in New Jersey before her family moved to Texas, and then to Detroit where she could better train for figure skating. She actually started her ice skating career at the age of 6, though even before then became a roller-skater. In addition to her 1997 National and World Titles, Lipinski won the coveted Gold Medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, as well as the 1996-1997 Grand Prix Gold Medal (Ladies’ Singles) in Hamilton, Ontario, and the 1997-1998 Grand Prix Gold Medal at Munich (Ladies’ Singles). After having to withdraw from the 1998 World Championships due to an infection occurred from having molars extracted, Lipinski turned professional. (See our article “10 Major Accomplishments by Young People” for more youthful achievements.)\n2. Joe Nuxhall, Major League Baseball Pitcher, age 15.\nIn 1944, while most American able bodied men were in the military service during World War II, this teen aged prodigy made his major league debut as a left handed pitcher at the tender age of 15, the youngest major leaguer ever. Joe was no flash in the pan as his career with the Cincinnati Reds lasted until 1966, although interrupted by stops in Kansas City and Los Angeles. Along the way he managed to set the team record for pitching appearances (pitching in 484 games) and compiled a record of 135 wins and 115 1osses with an ERA of .390. Joe’s career in the major leagues lasted only the one game in 1944, until he worked his way back up to the “Big Show” in 1952. After his retirement as a player in 1966, Nuxhall went into broadcasting, a second career that lasted until his death in 2007 at the age of 79. Nuxhall was a product of Hamilton, Ohio. Joe Nuxhall was a 2 time National League All Star and is an inductee to the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame.\n(Special Mention: Bob Feller of the Cleveland Indians, perhaps the greatest pitcher of all time, who made his debut with the Tribe in 1936 at the age of 17. Feller went on to a terrific major league career, a career with 4 of his best years taken out of the middle by his voluntary service in the US Navy during the war, serving aboard the battleship USS Alabama. Feller ended his career with a then record 3 no-hitters and a still record 12 1-hitters. In fact, the next nearest pitcher on the list since 1900 has only 6 1-hitters! Who knows what Feller may have done in his prime had he not been interrupted by war service.)\n3. Marjorie Gestring, Olympic Gold Medal Diver, age 13.\nA product of the Golden State (California), Gestring was born in 1922, and before she even turned 14 she had won an Olympic Gold Medal at the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics in the 3 meter diving competition. At that time, Marjorie was the youngest Olympian ever to win a Gold Medal, and remains the second youngest to this date. Gestring added 3 National titles to her trove of awards, and in 1940, with World War II in progress, the US Olympic Committee awarded her an Olympic Gold Medal even though the Games were not held that year due to the war. Attempting a competitive comeback in 1948, Marjorie failed to make the US Olympic team. South Korean speed skater\nSpecial Mention: Kim Yun-mi broke Gestring’s age record at the 1994 Winter Olympics when she took the Gold Medal in the 3000 meter relay, a feat she repeated at the 1998 Winter Olympics.\n4. Nadia Comăneci, Olympic Gold Medal Gymnast, age 14.\nBorn in Onești, Romania in 1961, Nadia took the 1976 Summer Olympics and the world by storm by winning 3 Olympic Gold Medals in Gymnastics before she had turned 15 years old. Not only that, Nadia became the first ever Olympic gymnast to score a perfect 10 at an Olympic competition. For good measure she came back at the 1980 Olympic Games and won 2 additional Olympic Gold Medals. In all, Nadia earned 9 Olympic Medals, and won the hearts of millions of people across the world, greatly enhancing the popularity of the sport of gymnastics. Her official retirement ceremony took place in Bucharest in 1984. Nadia has lived in the United States since 1989, with her husband, US Olympic gymnast Bart Connor.\nSpecial Mention: Prior to Nadia’s groundbreaking performance in 1976, Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut was the darling of the gymnastics world when she won 3 Olympic Gold Medals in ladies Gymnastics in 1972 (Team, Balance Beam, and Floor) at the age of 17.\n5. Betty Robinson, Olympic Gold Medal 100 meter Dash, age 16.\nThe 1928 Summer Olympic Games in Amsterdam would be the debut of the Women’s 100 Meter Dash competition, and a 16 year old girl from Riverdale, Illinois (born 1911) would become the first ever female Olympic 100 Meter Dash Gold Medalist. She also won a Silver Medal at the Amsterdam Olympics in 1928 in the Women’s 4 X 100 meter relay, and won another Gold Medal at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, again in the 4 X 100 meter relay. Amazingly, Betty’s first ever race was in March of 1928, and at her second race ever she tied the 100 Meter Dash world record for women! Her Olympic Gold Medal 100 meter dash was only her 3rd race in competition, and she again tied the Women’s World Record in that event. She attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. A victim in a serious plane crash in 1931, Betty was reportedly taken to the coroner’s office where a startled coroner found the injured girl was still alive, but later information proved that story to be mistaken. Unable to walk normally for the next 2 years, she of course missed out on the 1932 Olympics, but made her comeback in 1936 to earn that second Gold Medal. She went on a long life, dying in 1999 at the age of 87.\n6. Lexi Thompson, Women’s US Open Golf Qualifier, age 12.\nNot surprisingly still an amateur golfer at the age of 12, Lexi became the youngest ever golfer to qualify for the Women’s US Open golf tournament in 2007, and remember, although she was an amateur, she was competing against the best professionals and amateurs in the world for a spot on tournament roster! Lexi turned professional in 2010 at the age of 15, and in 2011 she became the youngest ever winner of a professional women’s golf tournament LPGA) at the age of 16. Thompson also became the youngest winner of a Ladies European golf tournament event in 2011, and at the age of 19 won her first major tournament, the 2014 Kraft Nabisco Championship, at the time the second youngest female major tournament winner. She is still playing golf at the advanced age of 24! Lexi is a native of Coral Springs, Florida, and stands 6 feet tall.\n7. Bob Mathias, Olympic Gold Medal Decathlon, age 17.\nBorn in Tulare, California in 1930, Mathias became the “World’s Greatest Athlete” by winning the 1948 Olympic Decathlon at the London Olympics at the age of 17, an incredible feat. Bob matched his remarkable performance of 1948 by winning the 1952 Olympic Gold Medal in Decathlon at the 1952 Olympic Games in Helsinki. Bob’s 1952 performance was so dominating that he set a World Record in the Decathlon for margin of victory. Mathias later served for 8 years as a US Representative to Congress from California and held other government service jobs. He died of cancer at the age of 76 in 2006. Mathias attended Stanford University and even played 2 years of college football.\n8. Wilfred Benítez, World Champion Boxer (Junior Welterweight Division), age 17.\nBoxing is a brutal, very brutal sport. People get killed from injuries incurred in the boxing ring every so often, so the feat of becoming a World Champion boxer at the age of 17 (apologies to Stevie Nicks) is remarkable. Born in Puerto Rico in 1958, Wilfred turned professional at the incredibly young age of 15! Benitez piled up 25 wins and 0 losses by the time in 1976 when he got his first shot at the Welterweight title, facing champion Antonio Cervantes. A 15 round battle ensued, and at the end Benitez became the youngest ever professional boxing champion. He went on to a stellar career, marked by notable bouts with Thomas Hearns, Sugar Ray Leonard, and Roberto Duran. His career record stood at 53 wins, 8 losses, and 1 draw when he retired in 1990. His nickname was “El Radar.”\n9. Mike Tyson, World Champion Boxer (Heavyweight Division), age 20.\nIron Mike Tyson has had a checkered life in and outside the ring, marred by allegations of domestic violence, possible juvenile felonies, and biting a chunk of ear out of Evander Holyfield during a Championship bout! Still, what he accomplished by gaining the Heavyweight Boxing Championship at the age of 20 in 1986 against Champ Trevor Berbick is truly amazing. Tyson had amassed 27 professional victories in the ring in 1985 and 1986 prior to winning the Heavyweight Belt, a daunting number of professional fights in only a little more than one year! An arrest for rape in 1991 resulted in a conviction for that crime in 1992, and a 3 year stretch in prison during what should have been the prime of his career. Tyson is forever branded by the US Federal Government as a “Sex Offender.”\n10. Al Kaline, American League Batting Champion, age 20.\nKaline joined the Detroit Tigers at the age of 18 in 1953, bypassing the minor league development phase. In his third year of major league baseball, he stunned the American League by winning the Batting Championship with a batting average of .340, becoming the youngest player to win a major league batting title. Not since Ty Cobb in 1907 had a 20 year old won a batting title in the major leagues, though Kaline edged out Cobb in age. Al Kaline went on to a stellar career, posting a .297 lifetime batting average, smacking 3007 hits, and slamming 399 home runs while appearing in 18 All Star Games and winning 10 Gold Glove Awards.\nYour readership is much appreciated!\nFor more information, please see…\nGelman, Steve.

76	What exactly is civil society?	Civil society is the space for collective action around shared interests, purposes and values, distinct from government and commercial actors. This includes charities, NGOs, community groups, women's organizations, faith-based organizations, professional associations, trade unions, social movements, coalitions and advocacy groups.

Research shows that health equity is driven by policies in other sectors as well as complex social, economic and political factors. By providing information on other sectors’ agendas and policy approaches and by illustrating areas for potential collaboration, the Series encourages a more systematic dialogue with other sectors. Rather than concentrating only on public health interventions (e.g. treatment, prevention, protection), the Series suggests areas of mutual interest to motivate joint work.\nHealth in All policies (HiaP)\nHealth in all Policies (HiaP) highlights the important links between health and broader economic and social goals in modern societies, and it positions improvements in population health and reductions in health inequities as high priority, complex problems that demand an integrated policy response across sectors. This strategy considers the effects of policies on social determinants as well as the beneﬁcial impact of improvements in health on the goals of other sectors.\nThese case studies were commissioned by WHO and PHAC and focused on documenting experiences of intersectoral policy processes.

77	I'm studying wartime industry - how did Kaiser Shipyards revolutionize shipbuilding methods?	Kaiser Shipyards revolutionized shipbuilding by using cutting-edge technology where instead of building ships one piece at a time, workers built many pieces simultaneously and welded them together rather than riveting. This innovative approach led to remarkable efficiency - they built the S.S. Robert E. Peary, a 10,000 pound vessel, in just four days, 15 hours and 29 minutes, which was an incredible achievement.	['In the 1930’s many people of the Great Plains and beyond were being hit by two catastrophes, one being the Great Depression and the other the Dust Bowl. This resulted in people from states such as Oklahoma and Arkansas migrating west to California, known as the land of opportunity to seek a better life. By the year of 1940, two and a half million people had fled the Great Plains, and approximately 200,000 people had reached California. Vicella Hendrick and her husband Ray were a part of this migration as they successfully moved to California. Since then their descendants, three generations, still reside in the San Francisco Bay Area and have never moved out of the area.\nIn April of 1916, James and Martha Stovall’s third daughter was born in Sims, Arkansas, and they named her Vicella. James, Vicella’s father, a farmer by trade, owned a farm in a little town by the name of Antlers, Oklahoma where he raised livestock and grew cotton, fruit, and vegetables. Martha, Vicella’s mother tended the household and sold butter and eggs on the side. The Stovall’s had six children, which included three other girls and two boys: Della, Clyde, Hazel, Dorsey, and Lila.\nVicella attended a public elementary school in town, which had two classrooms, one class taught 1st through 4th grades and the other taught 5th through 8th grade. She then attended Antlers High School. While In school, Vicella loved all kinds of sports, especially baseball. During her school days Vicella learned many skills. Living on a farm, she and her siblings performed many chores; in addition Vicella’s mother taught her how to sew, embroider, and the art of quilting. Vicella has made many beautiful and expertly crafted quilts. She would later sew beautiful clothing for her daughter and granddaughter. She also knows how to ride a horse as the family owned horses and many other farm animals.\nVicella married Ray Hendrick in 1932 who was born in De Queen, Arkansas. He was a local boy who also lived in Antlers and they eventually moved into their own apartment after living with Ray’s parents for a while. In 1935, Ray found employment with the State of Arkansas as a Forest Ranger in which he remained employed until 1940. Ray was truly fortunate to have a steady job during the time of the Great Depression and Dust Bowl which enabled he and Vicella to save enough money to eventually fulfill their dream of moving to California.\nEven with a steady income in an unstable time, the Hendrick’s wanted more out of life and moved forward with their plans to move to California, the land of opportunity. Most of the people who moved to California at that time did so as an act of desperation, but not for Vicella and Ray. In 1940 during World War II with the help of Ray’s father Charles Hendrick, who had already relocated to California a few years before, they finally made the move. While in California, Ray’s father Charles had procured employment at the Kaiser Shipyard in Richmond, California, and lived in a small apartment. For Vicella and Ray, who left their families behind and made the long drive from Oklahoma in their 1932 Chevrolet Coupe, the trip was a little more bearable as they had a home and a family member waiting for them when they arrived at their destination.\nIt did not take long for the Hendrick’s to establish themselves in their own apartment in San Francisco. After moving into their new apartment Ray procured employment the very next day at the Kaiser Shipyards in Richmond. Vicella also found employment with the Sears Roebuck Company two weeks later. During this time, World War II was heating up and in December of 1940, the Kaiser Shipyard began to build war ships. More than 747 ships were built there which was not equaled anywhere else in the world. The demand for workers was very great and the pay was good, so Vicella left her job at Sears Roebuck and she also went to work at the Richmond Shipyard.\nDuring World War II the little town of Richmond, California became famous mainly because of the Kaiser Shipyards. Richmond’s population grew dramatically from 23,000 to over 100,000 in a very short time, with migrants coming from all over the country. Henry J. Kaiser had constructed 25,000 temporary dwellings to house the influx of workers. At the peak of the War, the shipyard employed over 90,000 workers in which 25% were women. The shipyard used the most modern and cutting edge ship building technology existing at the time to set records that still remain today. Instead of building a ship one piece at a time, the workers built many pieces at the same time and then welded them together instead of riveting them together. This saved a lot of time and in fact, they built the S.S, Robert E, Peary a 10,000 pound vessel in only four days, 15 hours and 29 minutes, which was an incredible feat. The motto of the time for women was “Can you use an electric mixer? If so, you can learn to operate a drill.” As many as 20 million women worked outside the home between the years of 1941 and 1945 and by 1944 they made up 65% of the workforce. The name given to women who left being housewives to help in the war effort was “Rosie the Riveter.”\nVicella was one of these “Rosies” during this time and her job title at the shipyard was “Shipfitter” where she assembled dry racks. These racks that she and her crew assembled were used for dry food storage on board the Liberty Ships they were building. In the construction of these racks, two girls worked out on the fitting dock burning, beveling, and notching the angles of the racks. Each piece was then marked and sent to the hull, where the other girls on their crew fit them together. This practice of completing as much work as possible away from the crowded ship enabled the crews to cut the assembly time by one-fourth. Shipfitter’s wages were 97 cents per hour, which was pretty good money in those days. Vicella and her husband continued to work in the Shipyard until the war was over.\nAfter the war almost everybody in the shipyards were laid off, and they flocked to the unemployment office, including Vicella and Ray. Vicella and Ray both worked at odd jobs for a couple of years after that and their first child Marsha was born in October of 1948. At the time of the birth of their daughter, Ray was working at a local Texaco service station in Richmond. He eventually bought the service station in 1950, and owned and operated it for 17 years. Vicella, on the other hand, worked at a local pharmacy, and continued to work in pharmacies for over 25 years. She also returned to school at that time and earned a certificate as a licensed cosmetologist and sold high end cosmetics and expensive perfumes to ladies who came into the store.\nVicella was a member of the Rheem Avenue Baptist church in Richmond in which she served as the church treasurer for many years.\nShe has enjoyed many activities and hobbies which includes sewing, quilting, needlework and reading. She and her husband also enjoyed fishing and boating in the nearby lakes and rivers.\nVicella’s husband passed away in the early 70’s. Vicella continued to live in Richmond for several years then moved to Antioch where she retired and purchased a new home. To keep busy she found a part time job at the local Sears store and also volunteered at the Antioch Senior Citizens Center. Vicella also learned to bowl and bowled on a senior league for many years.\nVicella currently has two grandchildren, Lori Galiza and Ray Painter, and has four great grandchildren.\nLast August, Vicella came to reside at Diamond Terrace Retirement Community where she currently enjoys a leisurely life and has made many friends.\nOn April 4, we wish Vicella a Happy 100th Birthday!']	['<urn:uuid:7f5008f9-19ae-4f8b-a7dd-0fbcd29d0848>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	12	63	1350
78	how many tons plastic blocker process monthly	There are two sizes of Blockers: The Community Blocker can process up to 30 tons of plastic per month and is designed for small recycling operations and community projects. The Industrial Blocker is larger and can process 90+ tons of plastic per month, being intended for large-scale industrial installations.	['The global plastic recycling industry has been in the spotlight over the last few years due to increasing awareness about the abundant plastic waste problem, carbon emissions issue and the need to reduce them both. This coupled with the recent China ban, which took effect in December 2017, has accelerated the need for new and different solutions to plastic waste. ByFusion is offering such a solution through it’s patented process that converts all types of plastic waste into an advanced building material.\nGround Zero for Plastic Recycling and Diversion– Materials Recovery Facilities (MRF’s) + ByFusion\nMeet the Blocker and ByBlock\nWe call the Blocker the “ultimate environmental diversion solution”. To explain it simply, this machine takes plastic waste and converts it into construction-grade building blocks, ByBlocks. The Blocker is designed to be placed and operated in MRFs and plastic producing facilities as their purpose is to “maximize the quantity of recyclables processed, while producing materials that will generate the highest possible revenues in the market.”² Because copious amounts of plastic are being sent to MRFs already, they have the ability to significantly increase the plastic being processed by allocating unrecyclable plastics to the Blocker which then produces the ByBlock (without the costs of sorting and prewashing), a product able to generate increased revenue.\nBlockers– Modular and Scalable\nThe Blocker comes in two primary sizes– Community and Industrial. The Community Blocker is geared toward small recycling operations, community projects, disaster relief/clean-up efforts and mobility, with the capacity to process up to 30 tons of plastic per month. The Industrial Blocker, however, is intended for large scale, industrial installations and can be scaled up or down to meet venue space limitations and almost any plastic volume requirement, processing 90+ tons per month.\nBlocker– How it Works\nThe innovative technology which makes up the Blocker, converts any type of plastic, including plastic numbered 3-7, which are among the most difficult to recycle, into a useful, marketable construction-grade building block called ByBlock.\nByBlocks in a nutshell– or plastic clam shell as it were:\n- Dimensions: 16″ x 8″ x 8″ / 40cm x 20cm x 20cm\n- Weight: 22lbs / 10kg\n- Can be customized to specific densities\n- Doesn’t crack or crumble like concrete blocks\n- Requires no glue or adhesives\n- 41% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than concrete blocks\nLet’s Build with the ByBlock\n- Landscaping & Walling: Privacy, sound and retaining\n- Infrastructure & Utility: Sound walls, kiosks, storage sheds, security\n- Parks & Recreation: Pavilions, benches, planters, open space projects\n- Commercial, Residential & Consumer: Accent walls, furniture, modular structures such as sheds, detached office spaces and various other residential projects\nThe ByBlock can be utilized to improve infrastructure by anyone, eliminating the need for highly skilled, in-demand construction tradesmen/women, opening up a whole new labor field to support construction needs. However, as highlighted above, ByFusion’s business plan is not limited to consumer building needs. ByFusion aims to partner with materials recovery facilities, corporations, waste management companies, and governments to install Blockers on site, allowing them to effectively process excess plastic and create an additional revenue stream through the budding ByBlock market.\nWhy Choose ByFusion?\nBelow are four reasons for MRFs to incorporate a ByFusion Blocker into their technology stack:\nByFusion Increases Revenue Opportunities and/or Lowers Costs:\nByFusion allows MRFs to create saleable construction-grade building products, ByBlock, thus creating a new revenue stream and decreasing the overall cost associated with currently sending this plastic to landfill and paying tipping fees.\nDecreases Contamination and Increases Diversion:\nContamination in recycling is a major issue for all MRFs. ByFusion creates systemic incentive to sort what is currently considered a contaminant, bound for the landfill and recovers it as valuable material for construction-grade building blocks.\nByFusion’s Blockers Are Modular:\nMRFs come in all shapes and sizes and thus require adaptable, modular technology to custom fit their unique waste volumes and space requirements. Similarly, Blockers are designed to support small facilities and waste streams or scaled to meet the needs of large volumes and expansive facilities.\nMeeting Community’s Environmental Goals:\nMRFs have the challenging position of meeting regional or statewide waste diversion requirements, yet are subject to the vagaries of national and international waste markets. ByFusion offers MRFs something no other plastic recovery technology does– the opportunity to locally divert a community’s plastic waste and turn it into a product for building local facilities and structures– true local diversion and local recycling.\nOur Dedication to Bettering the Environment and Communities Across the Globe\nByFusion is focused on creating a partner network that solves the global plastic crisis by empowering communities to block their waste in place while leveraging it to solve increasing challenges around job creation, affordable housing and crumbling infrastructure, the support of aggressive waste reduction goals, and supply the local market with an incredibly cost effective, 100% recycled advanced building material. ByFusion is recognized by the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, New York Times, Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas (2019), US Green Building Council Net Zero Accelerator (2019), B Corps Best for the World (2019), 1% for the Planet’s Innovation of the Year (2018) and Waste Dive’s ‘Most Disruptive Innovation of the Year’ Award (2016). As a company, we are dedicated to the healing of Earth and truly believe our patented process is a key component to regenerating the planet and reshaping our relationship to plastic.']	['<urn:uuid:380c88c1-918a-4b35-ab9f-f0425a5d1594>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	7	49	893
79	I'm learning about World War 2 and am curious why Britain needed aircraft carriers so much - what would have happened if Britain didn't have success with their carriers in the Atlantic?	Without the Allied victory in the Battle of the Atlantic, Britain could not have fed her people or withstood Axis offensives in Europe and North Africa. Additionally, without Britain's survival and Allied shipments of food and industrial equipment to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's military and economic power would likely not have recovered in time for Russian soldiers to prevail at Stalingrad and Kursk.	"['Aircraft Carrier Operations During WW2\nContributor: Bob Bryant\nAircraft carriers played a large part in deciding the outcome of World War II\'s decisive victories at sea that, in turn, created the essential conditions for the war\'s decisive victories on land. Shortly after the war began, carriers bypassed battleships and and became the capital ships around which combatant navies centered their fleets for major offensive operations. Carrier aircraft could deliver bombs and torpedoes to targets hundreds of miles away, while even battleships with the largest guns could only rain destruction down on targets within 26 miles. Accordingly, the major naval powers, the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan, commissioned a total of only 23 new battleships during the war but commissioned a total of 55 new fleet carriers (CV) and light carriers (CVL). A total of 145 escort carriers (CVE) and merchant aircraft carriers (MAC) were also launched.\n|Production of aircraft carriers, September 1939 - August 1945|\nDuring the entire war, battleship guns sank only a single fleet carrier and a single battleship. In comparison, carrier-launched aircraft damaged, sank, or took part in sinking 19 battleships, including eight at Pearl Harbor. Along with Pearl Harbor, the earlier use of carrier-launched aircraft at Taranto demonstrated their effectiveness. After the Battle of Midway, Japan began leaving battleships out of major naval engagements, and battleships of all navies were more often used for bombarding land targets than engaging in naval battles.\nSuccessful naval battles kept shipping lanes open for a combatant\'s movement of troops, guns, ammunition, tanks, warships, aircraft, raw materials, and food. Without the Allied victory in the Battle of the Atlantic, Britain could not have fed her people or withstood Axis offensives in Europe and North Africa. Without Britain\'s survival and without Allied shipments of food and industrial equipment to the Soviet Union, that country\'s military and economic power would likely not have rebounded in time for Russian soldiers to prevail at Stalingrad and Kursk. Without victories at sea in the Pacific Theater, the Allies could not have mounted amphibious assaults on or maintained land forces on Guadalcanal, New Guinea, Saipan, The Philippines, Iwo Jima, or Okinawa.\nNumber of Aircraft Carriers In Operation During the War\nThe United States, United Kingdom, and Japan were the only combatants that made significant use of aircraft carriers during the war. The table below shows the number of ships each country operated between July 1937 and August 1945 that had flight decks for both launching and recovering aircraft at sea. Early in the war, the Royal Navy introduced fighter catapult ships (FACs) and catapult aircraft merchant ships (CAMs) for convoy escort that could launch aircraft by catapult, but there was no provision for recovering them. Â After completing an attack, the planes were simply ditched and their pilots recovered. Â Late in the war the Japanese Army introduced some ships that had flight decks from which aircraft could be launched, but the decks were too short for the aircraft to land on. These UK and Japanese ships are not included in the table.\nFrance had one aircraft carrier, but it did not see action during the war. Canada operated two of the escort carriers included below under Britain\'s carriers using British aircrews. All but six of Britain\'s escort carriers were produced in the US.\n|Aircraft Carriers Operated, September 1939 - August 1945|\n|Fleet (CV)||Light (CVL)||Escort (CVE)||MAC||Total|\nAircraft Carrier Functions\nAircraft carriers were used in a wide variety of operations. They fought in major naval battles against enemy fleets. They supported invasions during which carrier-launched aircraft bombed enemy positions, spotted for warship bombardment guns, and delivered aircraft to land bases afterward. They raided enemy positions, keeping them off-balance and reducing their combat capability. Carrier aircraft denied shipping lanes to enemies, sank raiders and submarines, escorted conveys, and delivered aircraft to other carriers and to land bases. Carriers were also used for training pilots and, at the end of the war, helped repatriate troops to their homes.\nThe combatants differed in the functions they emphasized for carrier use, in part as a result of the challenges presented by their principal theater of operations. The table below indicates the percentage of carriers each combatant used for each function. For example, the US Navy operated a total of 33 fleet and light carriers during the war. Seventy-three percent of these carriers participated in naval battles at one time or another. Eighty-five percent were involved in support of invasions, etc. Escort carriers, although initially envisioned by many to perform only in support roles, ultimately performed all of the functions that the fleet and light carriers did.\n|Number of Carriers||Naval Battles||Invasions||Raids||Anti-Ship||Anti-Raid||Anti-Sub||Convoy Escort||Trans.||Training||Repat.|\n|CVs & CVLs|\nOverview of Operations Involving Aircraft Carriers\nBritain entered the war in 1939 with a total of seven fleet and light aircraft carriers, all but one of which was in the Atlantic Theater. Three of these carriers were sunk before the US entered the war. During the war in the Atlantic Theater, Allied carriers transported and protected transportation of troops, aircraft, tanks, oil, and food from or routed through North America or up the West African coast to Britain, Russia, North Africa, and continental Europe. Allied escort carriers screened by corvettes, destroyers, and destroyer escorts proved more successful and cost-effective than using fleet carriers, battleships, or cruisers for protecting convoys from attacks by Axis submarines, raiders, and land-based aircraft. By mid-1943, the Axis threat of cutting essential Allied supply lines had passed. By this time, however, German battleships and submarines had sunk a total of five British fleet and light carriers, as shown in the table, below. Three Allied escort carriers had also been sunk.\n|Fleet/Light Carriers Sunk|\n|1939-1945 CV & CVL||5||5||16||26|\n|1939-1945 CV, CVL, & CVE||12||8||21||41|\nAt the time Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, she had nine carriers in the Pacific and had superiority both in number and effectiveness. During the 1930s, Japan had originated and refined the massed use of carriers and carrier aircraft in combat operations. For the first six months of the war, her unequaled Mobile Force of six fleet carriers (Kido Butai) was able to roam virtually at will from Hawaii in the east to Ceylon in the West. Japan\'s carriers supported successful invasions of the American Philippines, British Malaya and Burma, and the Dutch East Indies.\nBetween May and October 1942, however, Japan lost six of her carriers as Japanese and United States navies fought four major naval battles between fleets centered on their aircraft carriers. During these battles, opposing warships never came within sight of each other nor fired their guns at other warships. Aircraft alone did the attacking. The first of these battles thwarted the Japanese attempt in the Coral Sea to isolate Australia. The second halted the expansion of Japanese control eastward in the Pacific toward Midway Island. The next two helped sustain the American presence on Guadalcanal. These four engagements were costly for both sides. At the time Pearl Harbor was attacked, Japan had a total of nine fleet and light carriers in the Pacific theater. The United States had four in the Pacific with another two far away in the Atlantic. At the end of October 1942, after battle attrition from sinkings and damages, Japan had only three such carriers fully operational in the Pacific theater and The United States, for a two-week period, had none. Though costly, the battles were strategically advantageous for the Americans, contributing significantly to the shift of strategic initiative in the Pacific Theater from Japan to the United States. Japan did not engage her carriers in a major initiative again until the Battle of the Philippine Sea in mid-1944.\nNumber of Operational Aircraft Carriers\nCarriers were not available for operations all of the time they were afloat. After commissioning, there were delivery periods, refits and sea trials before carriers became operational. After first becoming operational, combat damage, operational mishaps, or damage from typhoons could render a carrier not combat-ready. Taking into account all the factors that kept aircraft carriers out of combat after first becoming operational, fleet and light carriers were typically operational about 80% of the time. They were typically out of service 5% to 15% for combat-related damage repair and 5% to 10% for delivery and refitting to otherwise improve performance.\n|In Service||Damage Repair||Refitting|\n|Fleet & Light Carriers|\nThe number of operational carriers available to the combatants at any point in time affected the capability, plans, and outcomes of military operations in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters throughout the war. Taking into consideration the time for construction, shakedown trials, delivery, refitting, combat damage, and sinkings, the table below shows the number of fleet and light carriers that were operational for each combatant in each combat theater at the end of each month. The Pacific Theater includes the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic Theater includes the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe table capsulizes the course of the war for aircraft carrier operations. It reflects how Japan more than doubled the number of her carriers between leaving the Washington/London naval treaties in 1936 and the time she attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941. It also reflects the attrition for carriers during the formative year of 1942. It reflects the industrial capacity of the United States, illustrating how she could make good her losses of 1942 while Japan could not. Finally, it reflects the shift of British carriers to the Pacific after the Allies prevailed in battles for Atlantic waters. Note also that, after mid-1942, the percentage of aircraft carriers afloat that were in fact available for combat operations was typically less than 70%. During the Guadalcanal campaign that year, that percentage fell below 50%. From then until mid-1944, Japan did not engage her carriers in a major operation. When at last she did, the rest of her carriers were sunk or damaged.\n|Carrier Type: CV & CVL|\n|Theater:||Pacific||Atlantic||Pac & Atl||Pac & Atl||Oper.|\nThe details behind the numbers in the above tables may be found in the ""Documents"" section at the ""Reference"" tab at the World War II Database:\n- Collection of Statistics on Japanese Aircraft Carriers\n- Collection of Statistics on UK Aircraft Carriers\n- Collection of Statistics on US Aircraft Carriers\nRichard Frank (1990).

80	I want to learn about ancient animals - which lived longer on Earth, turtles or dinosaurs? Can you compare how long each existed?	Turtles have been around for 230 million years and are still alive today, while dinosaurs existed for about 170 million years before going extinct (except for birds) around 66 million years ago. This means turtles have existed for a longer time period, having survived through multiple mass extinctions including the one that killed the dinosaurs.	['Fossils give clues as to how turtles might respond to a warming planet\nThe distribution of ancient turtles from when the planet was warmer than today is helping scientists to anticipate how living turtles may respond to environmental change.\nFuture predictions of global warming means that current turtle habitats are likely to become unsuitable, but new areas could become available if turtles are able to adapt in time.\nWith global temperatures predicted to exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels in the next few decades, rapid environmental change is expected to have a devastating effect on animals and plants worldwide. However, determining how different species will be affected is difficult to anticipate.\nA new study published in Current Biology looks at the distribution of fossilized terrestrial and freshwater turtles over the past 100 million years during periods when temperatures were much warmer than they are today. The researchers then used this information to project forward and predict how modern-day turtles may respond to future climate scenarios.\nProfessor Paul Barrett, a paleobiologist at the Museum and senior author of the study, says, “What we find is that many of the areas where turtles are particularly diverse at the moment will become drier and hotter due to man-made global warming. As a result, those areas will become less suitable for these animals to live there.”\n“On the other hand, as the world warms other places may become habitable for turtles that would not have been suitable previously. Then they could migrate to different areas, but that depends on if they can do it in time, unobstructed by human interference.”\nCan we predict how turtles will respond to environmental change?\nTurtles are a group of reptiles found on every continent except Antarctica. They include sea turtles, terrapins and tortoises and are made up of species that live on the land and in salt and fresh water.\nAs cold-blooded animals, turtles cannot generate their own heat and so rely on their surroundings to regulate body temperature. Therefore, their distribution and species diversity are closely linked to environmental conditions.\nPrevious research has looked at the distribution of fossil turtles and compared them to climate models from those time periods. The study revealed that the conditions of areas occupied by ancient turtles were similar to those of living species.\n“Our latest research goes one stage further,” explains Paul. “We wanted to know what would happen to the distribution of turtles in worlds that are warmer than today.”\n“We looked at two time periods over the last 100 million years during the warmest parts of the Cretaceous and Eocene. We then took that information and projected forwards to a world that’s 1.5°C warmer than now, which is predicted to happen in the coming decades.”\n“As turtles have not changed much in their ecology over the last one hundred million years, we can assume that environmental conditions affecting their distribution today were also constraints on their distribution in the past.”\nTurtles have a surprisingly good fossil record compared to many other organisms because their shells preserve relatively well. This gives scientists a good idea of what their distribution would have been like in the past.\nDr. Alfio Alessandro Chiarenza, a researcher at the University of Vigo and lead author of the study, says, “Turtles are extraordinary biological models for understanding the biogeography of living animals because of their long evolutionary history, which probably pre-dates the dinosaurs.”\n“This means they faced and survived a plethora of environmental changes. So we wondered whether that could also tell us something relevant for their conservation in the wake of the ongoing anthropogenic climate change.”\nTurtles are resilient animals, having been around for 230 million years and weathering many mass extinctions, including the one that killed the dinosaurs. But their future is threatened once again as humans radically alter the environment.\n“By looking at modern and fossil distribution of turtles and reconstructing their ideal climatic conditions, we found that in the past, turtles moved towards the pole at times of global warming,” says Alfie “If we project the ideal conditions where turtles could live with future emission scenarios, by 2100 we expect these animals to reach similar high latitudes.”\n“Unfortunately, the rate at which this change is happening might be too fast for evolutionary time scales. Additionally, many of these high-latitude areas correspond to the densely human-populated temperate zones, so our own distribution and pressure in these areas may further hamper their survival.”\n“By looking at deep time history and merging modern biological knowledge with paleontology, we may provide additional guidance in the conservation of this group of reptiles.”\nAlfio Alessandro Chiarenza et al, 100 million years of turtle paleoniche dynamics enable the prediction of latitudinal range shifts in a warming world, Current Biology (2022).

Together, these three periods make up the Mesozoic Era. Due to the dominance of the dinosaurs and other reptiles during the Mesozoic Era, it has become known as the ‘Age of Reptiles’.\nMesozoic Era (252.17 to 66 million years ago)\n- Triassic Period (252.17 to 201.3 million years ago): Dinosaurs begin to appear, having evolved from reptiles called Archosaurs.\n- Jurassic Period (201.3 – 145 million years ago): Dinosaurs become the dominant land vertebrates.\n- Cretaceous Period (145 – 66 million years ago): Dinosaurs continue to thrive and diversify.\n- Cretaceous–Paleogene Extinction Event (around 66 million years ago): The dinosaurs are wiped out; only avian dinosaurs (birds) survive.\nFurther down the page you’ll find information on each of the three periods of the Mesozoic Era, including examples of the dinosaurs that existed during each period.\nMesozoic Era: ‘Age of Reptiles’\nThe Mesozoic Era lasted for around 186 million years. It began around 252.17 million years ago, and ended around 66 million years ago. Dinosaurs started to appear around 243 to 231 million years ago, during the Triassic Period.\nDinosaurs are among the most successful groups of animals ever to have lived. They walked the earth for around 170 million years. (Bear in mind that humans have only existed for 2 million years!)\nHowever, the dinosaurs’ successful reign came to an abrupt end.\nDinosaur Periods: Extinction\nThe Mesozoic Era ended with the ‘Cretaceous–Paleogene Extinction Event’, which wiped out the dinosaurs and many other species.\n(An extinction event is a sudden and wide-ranging decrease in the amount of life on Earth.)\nDivisions Of The Mesozoic Era\nAs we’ve seen, the Mesozoic Era is subdivided into three periods: the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. These are ‘geological periods’ of time: each corresponds to a particular layer of rock.\nThe scientific body responsible for measuring the geological timescale is the International Commission on Stratigraphy.\nIn the geological timescale, each period is further divided into ‘epochs’. The Triassic and Jurassic periods are divided into three epochs, the Cretaceous into two.\nMesozoic Era (252.17 to 66 million years ago)\n- Triassic Period (252.17 to 201.3 million years ago)\n- Early Triassic Epoch (252.17 – 247.2 million years ago)\n- Middle Triassic Epoch (247.2 – 237 million years ago)\n- Late Triassic Epoch (237 – 201.3 million years ago)\n- Jurassic Period (201.3 – 145 million years ago)\n- Early Jurassic Epoch (201.3 to 174.1 million years ago)\n- Middle Jurassic Epoch (174.1 to 163.5 million years ago)\n- Late Jurassic Epoch (163.5 to 145 million years ago)\n- Cretaceous Period (145 – 66 million years ago)\n- Early Cretaceous Epoch (145 to 100.5 million years ago)\n- Late Cretaceous Epoch (100.5 to 66 million years ago)\nThe Age of the Dinosaurs\nLet’s find out what the world was like during the three ‘dinosaur periods’ of the Mesozoic Era …\n1: Triassic Period (252.17 to 201.3 million years ago)\nThe Eoraptor is one of the first dinosaurs. It appeared during the Triassic Period.\nThe Triassic Period followed the worst extinction event that the world has ever experienced. (Yes, it was even worse than the later extinction event that would wipe out the dinsoaurs.)\nThe Permian-Triassic Extinction Event, or the ‘Great Dying’ as it is otherwise known, caused between 90% and 96% of all species on Earth to became extinct.\nAt the beginning of the Triassic Period, life on Earth struggled to rebuild itself. At first, the mammal-like reptiles, successful before the extinction event, started to dominate once again.\nMammal-like animals such as the Lystrosaurus – a strange, dog-sized animal with tusks – thrived in the Early Triassic. Mammals themselves would appear towards the end of the Triassic Period.\nHowever, it was another group of animals that would win the race to supremacy: the Archosaurs. Through the course of the Triassic Period, these reptiles became the dominant land vertebrates (animals with backbones).\nAs the Triassic Period progressed, the archosaurs split into two main branches. One of these was the Pseudosuchia, which includes the Crocodilians, and similar animals. The other branch was the Avemetatarsalia, which itself split into Pterosaurs and Dinosaurs.\nThe first dinosaurs were, small, walked on two legs, and ate meat.\nIn the Triassic period, all of the world’s land was joined together in one vast supercontinent called ‘Pangaea’, which means ‘whole Earth’. The climate was hot and dry. The interior of Pangaea was a vast desert.\nPlants such as conifers and ginkgoes flourished. There was no grass, and there were no flowering plants.\nWhen Were Dinosaurs Alive: Triassic Period Dinosaurs\nOne of the earliest dinosaurs was the Eoraptor, a small predator that lived around 228 million years ago (see picture, above). Found in north-west Argentina, it walked on two legs and stood knee-high to a human.\nEoraptor looked like a ‘typical’ dinosaur, with a long tail, long neck and short arms.\nSaurischia and Ornithischia\nEoraptor was a saurischian, one of the two main types of dinosaur. All of the meat-eating dinosuars were saurichians, as were many of the large, four-legged plant eaters.\nThe other main type of dinosaur was ornithischia. The Ornithischians were all herbivores (plant-eaters)\nOne of the earliest known Ornithischians is the Pisanosaurus. This was a small dinosaur that walked on two legs, and outwardly looked much like early bipedal (2-legged) saurichians.\nWhen Were Dinosaurs Alive: Triassic Period Dinosaurs\n2: Jurassic Period (201.3 – 145 million years ago)\nThe Jurassic Period began with another extinction event – the Triassic-Jurassic Extinction Event. While not quite as devastating as the earlier Permian-Triassic Extinction Event, it still led to a substantial decline in both sea and land species.\nThe extinction set the scene for dinosaurs – who were already flourishing by the end of the Triassic – to completely dominate the land.\nPangaea began to break apart in the Jurassic Period, forming two landmasses, Laurasia in the north, and Gondwana in the south. As the continents separated, the climate became wetter and more humid.\nConifer forests covered much of the land, especially near the poles. Ginkgoes, palms, tree-ferns and horse-tails were also present. The first birds appeared. Insects and amphibians continued to develop. Mammals evolved fur coats and started giving birth to live young.\nHuge sauropods such as Brachiosaurus walked the land, feeding on the flourishing vegetation. Large predators, such as Allosaurus also made an appearance.\nWhen Were Dinosaurs Alive: Jurassic Period Dinosaurs\nExamples of Early Jurassic Dinosaurs\nExamples of Mid Jurassic Dinosaurs\nExamples of Late Jurassic Dinosaurs\n3. Cretaceous Period (145 – 66 million years ago)\nDuring the Cretaceous Period, the continents continued to separate. Gondwana broke up to form South America and Africa, and Antarctica and Australia also drifted away. Laurasia began to split into North America, Europe and Asia. The world – as we know it today – began to take shape.\nThe climate became wetter, and the newly formed oceans offered new habitats.\nFlowering plants appeared in Laurasia at the beginning of the Cretaceous Period. By the end of the Cretaceous they were the Earth’s dominant plant type. Oak, maple and beech trees were all present. Insects evolved alongside the new plants.\nWhen Were Dinosaurs Alive: Cretaceous Period Dinosaurs\nAlthough some types of dinosaur, such as the Stegosaurs, died out during the Cretaceous Period, ever-more varied types evolved to take their places.\nDuck-billed dinosaurs such as Iguanodon, armoured dinosaurs such as Polacanthus, and the Ceratopsids, including Triceratops, all thrived during the Cretaceous Period.\nCretaceous–Paleogene Extinction Event\nMany of these dinosaurs existed right up to the end of the Cretaceous Period. However, 66 million years ago, the Earth was rocked by a catastrophic event that wiped out over 75% of all living species.\nThis was the Cretaceous–Paleogene Extinction Event, and it brought the whole Mesozoic Era to a close. At the dawn of the Cenozoic Era, the only dinosaurs still alive were the birds.\nAll of the non-avian dinosaurs had become extinct.\nScientists believe that the Cretaceous–Paleogene Extinction Event (which is also known as the K–Pg extinction event, or Cretaceous–Tertiary (K–T) extinction event) was caused by a large asteroid striking the Earth.\nThe explosion would have thrown up a dust cloud big enough to hide the sun for months, or even years. Plants would have been unable to grow in the darkness, and many of the Earth’s animals – including the dinosaurs – would have been unable to find enough food to survive.\nThe age of the dinosaurs had come to an end.\nExamples of Early Cretaceous Dinosaurs\nExamples of Late Cretaceous Dinosaurs\nDinosaur Periods: When Were Dinosaurs Alive – Conclusion\nThe Mesozoic Era is subdivided into three periods: the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.\nDinosaurs first appeared towards the end of the Triassic Period. Following the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event, the dinosaurs quickly became the dominant land animals on Earth. They would remain so throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods.\nThe dinosaurs became increasingly diverse throughout the Cretaceous Period, and thrived right up to the Cretaceous–Paleogene Extinction Event.\nThis extinction event, believed to have been caused by a large asteroid striking the Earth, wiped out all of the (non-avian) dinosaurs. Only avian dinosaurs – or birds – survived. (Many scientists today believe that birds are actually dinosaurs, meaning that birds are the only dinosaurs to have survived the extinction event).\nWe hope that you’ve enjoyed reading about the three ‘dinosaur periods’ of the Mesozoic Era.\nOther Relevant Pages on Active Wild\nYou can find more dinosaur information on our main Dinosaur Facts page, or check out these pages for in-depth dino facts:']	['<urn:uuid:b0e76b9a-3b04-4fa3-aa70-43769ee14861>', '<urn:uuid:9a6e8fa5-cab4-43f4-9eb6-c7dda4ff9d92>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	23	55	2481
81	What role do visual aids play in teaching angles versus fractions?	In teaching angles, visual aids include protractors, geo strips, construction materials and real-life examples from the environment. For fractions, visual aids include measuring cups, recipe ingredients, and poster board displays. Both subjects rely heavily on physical demonstrations - angles through body movements and turns, fractions through actual recipe preparation and measurement activities.	"[""|Lesson Plan ID:\nFractions and Recipes\nThis is a lesson used to show how fractions are used in everyday life. Students will use the knowledge they have about fractions to change a recipe to accommodate different amounts of people. Students will enjoy navigating the Internet to locate a recipe. Students will also have the opportunity to make the recipe in class and share it with their friends.\n|MA2015(5) ||16.

An angle is the shape of a corner. It may be sharp, or blunt, or right angled. Much more fruitful than the static conception of an angle is the dynamic conception of the measure of an angle. If a book is gradually opened, its pages make a growing angle with each other.”\nWilliams and Shuard (1994)\nIn order for the children to recognise angles in terms of rotation, it is preferable initially, for the children to investigate the angles in their environment that are dynamic, (where the angle can be easily made bigger or smaller by increasing or decreasing the distance between the two lines) e.g. a door opening and closing, a scissors cutting paper, the angles made by the hands of a clock. The children can then proceed to examine static angles (where the angle is fixed) e.g. in 2-D shapes or 3D objects.\nIn second class (and revised at the start of third class), the concept of rotation of an angle is taught through the terms quarter-turn, half-turn and full turn. Ideally, this should be introduced concretely by getting the children themselves to do half-turns and quarter-turns, and to turn in clockwise and anticlockwise directions:\n- In the classroom, the children start facing the board/front of room and make half/full/quarter turns to left/right as directed by the teacher.\n- Repeat, but this time with different starting points\n- Repeat, but this time after the teacher gives the directions the children must say where they will be facing, before they do the actual turn. The children could also record their predictions quickly on their Operation Maths MWBs\nThe children will be also be asked to identify 90º angles as square corners (2nd class) or right angles (3rd class). This will also be reinforced as part of the 2D shapes chapter. The children can be asked how they might decide if a corner/vertex of a shape is a square corner/right angle. Prior to the introduction of the protractor, something as simple as a corner torn from a piece of paper would suffice as an instrument with which to measure these angles.\nThe children should be enabled to classify angles according to the criteria appropriate to their class level (see table above). In particular, the ability to identify angles as acute (or less than a right angle), obtuse (or greater than a right angle) or reflex will greatly help the children, to later, estimate the measure of the angle in degrees, and to accurately measure and construct angles when they encounter this in 5th and 6th classes.\nIt is important to constantly reinforce the children’s understanding of what an angle actually is, i.e. an amount of turn and that this can be represented by two adjoining lines, one showing the starting position, the other showing the point after the turn. Return to concrete examples if necessary; the children stretch out two arms in front and, leaving one arm in original position, they move other arm a certain amount (90 º, 180º etc). This could also be repeated using geostrips, connected at one end using a brass clip, so as to be able to move one of the ‘arms’. Such concrete experiences also link well to measuring using a protractor; the original arm is the ‘base’ line.\nMeasuring and constructing angles (5th & 6th classes)\nUsing degrees to describe angles is introduced in 5th class, which develops to include measuring and constructing angles using degrees. This necessitates the use of a protractor for the first time, which in itself can lead to difficulties. The child may be unsure where exactly to place the protractor; this can come from a lack of understanding of what an angle actually is and where the angle actually is. Also, a child can be uncertain of which scale to use to measure the size of the angle eg for an acute angle measuring 45º, the child writes down 135º.\nTo reduce the likelihood of this arising you can ask some/all of the following questions:\n- What important tips would you give to a person about using a protractor?\n- How do you know which scale to use on the protractor?\n- What type of angle is this? How do you know? (To save time, they can write A, O or Re for Acute, Obtuse or Reflex).\n- Estimate the measure of the angle to the nearest 10º. Is your estimate/measurement sensible? Why?\n- How can you use what you know about acute and obtuse angles to check your measurement?\nYou can also watch some of the tutorial videos for using a protractor on the internet, such as the one below, for example. These videos can be a very visual way of demonstrating this skill. This interactive tutorial is also very useful to demonstrate how to measure angles, while also offering the child a chance to practice them selves. See also the list at the end of the blogpost for many other interactive angle activities from the internet.\nReasonableness of answer\nAngles is another area where it is important for the child to check the reasonableness of the answer. First, the child needs to identify whether the angle is acute or obtuse. Then, if measuring an acute angle, the measurement must be less than 90º. If it isn’t, then the correct scale wasn’t used.\nLines and Angles all around us\nIt is a given that lines and angles are all around us, although children may often be oblivious to the examples! Again, appropriate to each class level, the children should be encouraged to identify different types of lines and angles in their classroom, school and home. Enrich your own classroom space with lines and angles by labeling the line types in the room and the measure of angles of the open door. Make it personal by relating this topic to the children themselves and to the geometry in their names. Incorporate lines and angles into your visual art lessons (see also image below). Operation Maths 4 and 5 users can show the Maths Around Us video to their class, accessible on www.edcolearning.ie. For more ideas, check out this Lines & Angles board on Pinterest.\nOnline Interactive Resources\n- Operation Maths users don’t forget to check out the extensive digital resources available for this topic on Edco Learning. These include Maths Around Us and Write, Hide, Show videos, Create Activities using the Clock and Fraction eManipulatives and full instructions for linked Scratch lessons.\n- Math Games: Identify the parallel, perpendicular and intersecting lines\n- Study Ladder: Identify parallel and perpendicular lines in shapes (you will need to register for a free teachers account, where you can also register your students if wished).\n- That Quiz – Angles: A great interactive measuring test/practice. Ensure that only the “Measure” option on the left-hand side is ticked, and when you bring the mouse across the screen, it changes into a transparent protractor. Change the level on the drop-down menu also on the left-hand side to make the measurements required easier/more difficult. Another option is to use this quiz to calculate the value of a missing angle in a triangle; instead of ticking the “Measure” option, tick only “Triangle”.

82	When did the American people first come together to observe a nationwide celebration dedicated to protecting our planet and raising environmental awareness?	Earth Day was first celebrated in 1970, as a result of the efforts of Sen. Gaylord Nelson (D-Wis.)	"['Spikes in oil, gas, and food prices raise awareness of the need to conserve resources\nEarth Day was first celebrated in 1970, a result of the efforts of Sen. Gaylord Nelson (D-Wis.), a passionate advocate of protecting the environment and increasing awareness of environmental issues. While social activism was at peak levels in the late 1960s and early \'70s, legislation on environmental issues was nearly nonexistent. Nelson struggled since he was elected to the Senate in 1962 to persuade Congress to establish an environmental agenda. Frustrated by the obstacles and resistance he faced, he appealed to the mood of the public and designated April 22 as a ""national day for the environment."" He hoped to impress upon fellow politicians that humans have an enormous impact on the environment. Nelson certainly achieved his goal. More than 20 million Americans participated in the first Earth Day celebration, prompting voter-hungry politicians to take notice. The overwhelming response helped generate a new political focus on the environment. As that focus has become increasingly global, more people than ever are celebrating Earth Day around the world.\nIn the past several years as countries all over the world have been mired in recession and affected by turmoil in the Middle East, Earth Day has taken on increased significance. Indeed, skyrocketing food, gas, and oil prices have impacted people rich and poor, businesses large and small. That\'s the bad news. The good news is that the spike in energy and food prices has increased awareness about the dangers of global warming and inspired people and corporations to conserve resources and ""go green.""\nMany companies are doing their part by encouraging employees to use less paper and take public transportation to and from work, allowing some employees to telecommute, and using green materials and alternative heating systems when they rebuild or renovate.

83	What are the main manufacturing methods for pile fabrics?	Double-cloth and over-wire methods are the two ways to create pile fabrics. In the double cloth method, two fabrics are woven, one above the other, and connected with an extra set of warp yarns. The over-wire method involves placing wires across the loom so that they intersect the cloth in certain places that create a pile.	['Select from these categories\nto narrow the results.\nFabric Properties and Distinctions – Velvet\nThe luxury, the indulgence that is velvet…\nBy: Karen Brandon\nIn the past there has been some controversy surrounding the existence of velvet in earlier centuries. Velvet has in fact been around as early on as 2000BC. The Egyptians were documented using a technique similar to the one that is utilized today in velvet production. Throughout the centuries from the medieval era through the renaissance into the flapper rage and still today velvet is being used in a variety of ways. In earlier times only royalty and nobility could afford to own garments of velvet. It requires more yarns to create and a number of extra steps in the process, which adds to the expense of velvet garments. It was also common for supplementary sets of yarns to be placed on the surface of the fabric to create a brocade effect making the design intricate and interesting. As the nobility knew and we can still see today some of the richest colors can be produced when dying velvet. It has only been in this century that velvet has become affordable to the masses. The industrial revolution brought with it the chance for the common person to experience luxury that was for centuries reserved for royalty and the rich.\nTypes of Velvet:\nThe most common type of velvet is a plain weave with a cut pile. It is soft, comes in deep, rich colors and is typically used in formal or eveningwear. This type of velvet generally retails between $16 and $25 a yard (the price may vary depending on quality and location). Velvet is also commonly used in interior design applications from curtains to upholstery to accent pillows. A common type of upholstery is cut velvet, which has a pattern cut out from around uncut loops of pile. Crushing the velvet pile can produce two additional types of velvet, crushed velvet and panné velvet. Crushed velvet involves the fabric being mechanically twisted while wet. Applying heavy pressure to the pile in one direction produces panné velvet. Crushed velvet is also found in interior applications but is often used in apparel as well. For upholstery purposes crushed velvet can have a coated backing applied to provide stability. When being used in apparel the texture of the crushed velvet creates a beautiful luster effect and the direction of the pile can also be used to provide various looks from the same piece of fabric.\nNot to be confused with:\nAlthough they are made the same as true velvet the pile depth differs.\nVelveteen: A pile fabric that generally has a shorter pile than true velvet.\nVelour: A cotton fabric that has a deeper pile than velveteen and is heavier in weight. It is commonly used in upholstery and draperies.\nKnit fabrics can now be made to resemble types of velvet, allowing for the stretch and comfort that we enjoy in today’s clothing. Panné velvet is often found as a knit. Garments are often mislabeled in catalogs as velvet when they are really knits. Even though they may look the similar, knits are not true velvets.\nVelvet is a warp-pile fabric, which means that it has one set of filling yarns and two sets of warp yarns. The second set of warp yarns can be cut or un-cut. Double-cloth and over-wire methods are the two ways to create pile fabrics. In the double cloth method, two fabrics are woven, one above the other, and connected with an extra set of warp yarns. The over-wire method involves placing wires across the loom so that they intersect the cloth is certain places that create a pile. The pile is then cut with a blade that is over the loom. The wire is removed before the fabric is removed from the loom. If an un-cut pile is desired, waste picks can be placed on the wire and are removed after the fabric is off the loom. Velvet can be made out of various types of fibers and blends. The most common types of fibers used are rayon, silk and acetate.\nVelvet must be handled carefully and stored properly because folds and creases can permanently flatten the pile. If you need to get creases out of velvet you will need a steamer or a velvet board (a fat board that has hundreds of fine wires sticking out perpendicular). The velvet board helps to protect the pile while it is being ironed. Finer, plain weave velvets can only be dry-cleaned and are difficult to spot clean. Most knit velvets must also be dry-cleaned but some panné and other crushed velvet fabrics can be machine-washed. As always the best thing to do is read the manufacturer’s label for recommended care. Velvet is a beautiful and luxurious fabric to own but you must provide extra attention to the care and maintenance of this fabric.\nTextile Fabric Consultants, Inc. manufactures fabric swatch kits for students who study textiles in colleges and universities. These kits are also sold to professionals in the industry. We also sell to high schools, department stores, interior designers and costume designers. The kits are designed to help educate people about a variety of fabrics and to be a permanent hands on reference for the user.']	['<urn:uuid:f361f482-f4bb-423a-8fe2-ec2646a9fe21>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	9	56	882
84	Do Camp Aranu'tiq and Scout troops both offer outdoor camping programs?	Yes, both offer camping programs. Camp Aranu'tiq is an overnight summer camp with 135 campers per session, while Scout troops engage in extended hikes and lots of camping as part of their outdoor and environmental activities. Both programs focus on creating safe and structured environments for youth to build confidence and make friends.	"['Who can attend Camp Aranu\'tiq\'s programs?\nCamp Aranu\'tiq is for those who feel that they do not fit into the norms our society has prescribed for gender. This includes those who have ""transitioned,"" those who happen to express their gender differently than others, and those who may experience teasing or bullying because of their gender.\nWhy don\'t you say exactly where your camps are?\nConfidentiality and privacy are very important to our campers and their families. Our camp population is not as safe as we wish they could be in the world outside of camp, and we want to make sure that the only people with access to our location are families & volunteers who are signed up to attend.\nIs Aranu\'tiq a ""therapy"" camp?\nNo. Aranu\'tiq is in most ways a very typical overnight summer camp; our population (and great people!) are what makes us unique. We do not hold formal discussions about personal experiences of gender, though of course many of our campers talk about it with each other. Our campers should be able to be successful in a structured, loud, and very busy environment for a full week or two with 100+ other people.\nWho are the Aranu\'tiq camp counselors?\nOur counselors are a mix of staff and volunteers who help create a wonderful place for our youth. Many return summer after summer. About half to two-thirds of our counselors at each program are trans-identified. We feel it is important to have role models who are of all gender identities and expressions. We seek a diverse group of staff and volunteers. We have an application process that includes interviews, references, and background checks.\nCan camper parents be volunteers?\nUnfortunately, due to the high number of requests we receive, we have made a blanket policy not to accept parents, guardians, or close family members of campers as volunteers. Check out our family camp!\nWhat is Harbor Camps?\nHarbor Camps is the overarching ""parent"" organization that Camp Aranu\'tiq is a part of. Harbor Camps was also founded by Nick Teich and is run by the same staff that runs Aranu\'tiq. Harbor Camps includes not just Camp Aranu\'tiq (although that is its largest camp), but also two weeklong camps separate from Aranu\'tiq for the following populations:\n- Camp Seneb for youth with dwarfism (2016)\n- Youth with craniofacial anomalies/facial differences (2019)\nEach of these communities are often marginalized and face teasing and bullying simply because of who they are. Harbor Camps seeks to be a safe camp atmosphere that brings together youth, historically under-served in the camp community, who can understand each other\'s journeys and make lifelong friends. All of Harbor Camps\' additional camps take place at our property in New Hampshire.\nVisit www.harborcamps.org for more information.\nHow do you pronounce ""Aranu\'tiq?""\nWhat does ""Aranu\'tiq"" mean?\nAranu\'tiq is a chugach (Yup\'ik, an Indigenous people of Alaska) word for a person who was thought to embody both the male and female spirit. Aranu\'tiq people were often revered and thought to be very lucky because their existence transcended traditional boundaries.\nHow many times can campers return to Aranu\'tiq\'s programs?\nCampers can come back until they age out of each program, as long as we have room.\nHow many campers attend Aranu\'tiq?\nWe have approximately 135 campers in each session.\nCan you accommodate special diets at Aranu\'tiq?\nYes, our chefs are used to providing food for a typical diet, as well as for vegetarians, vegans, and those with gluten intolerance. We are a peanut-free camp. If your child has more complex food needs, please contact us so we can discuss them.', ""Scouts (Ages 11-14)\nScouts is about having fun while gaining value leadership skills and self-confidence.\nScouts enjoy outdoor adventures like mountain biking, rock climbing and lots of camping while working together with other young people to accomplish thrilling challenges.\nScouting gives every member a chance to be a leader. It might involve running an activity, organizing a camp, or participating with other young people across your province or Canada in a youth forum.\nBlaze a Trail: Scouts blaze their own trails.

In short, it’s about having life-changing experiences.\nEach Outdoor Adventure Skills pathway is divided into nine stages with a badge awarded for each stage; however, the purpose of the OAS program is not the badge. Rather, the Outdoor Adventure Skills should be seen as tools to support the Plan-Do-Review process—for example, organizing an activity that matches the level of skills that the participants have, or evaluating the amount of growth a person experienced in a particular skill set they wanted to expand on.\nPERSONAL ACHIEVEMENT BADGES (PAB)\nYouth have opportunities to earn up to 16 badges by planning their own adventures.\nPERSONAL PROGRESSION BADGES (PPB)\nFollowing a Year-End Review, a Scout received the appropriate Person Progression Badge.\nAJ D. - Chief Scout's Award Recipient (2018)\nAJ D. - Chief Scout's Award Recipient (2018)\nTOP SECTION AWARD\nChief Scout's Award\nThis very special top section award is awarded to a Trailblazer who has completed a personal progression review, 18 OAS badges, 30 community service hours, one community service project that is personally challenging, and a final review of the Award Project with Troop Leadership Team, or its designates.\nMeet the Troop Scouter Team\nScouter Candy (Bubbles)\nScouter Bubbles joined 15th Lethbridge as a volunteer in 2014.

Willow trees are also excellent early spring food sources for pollinators. When planning for pollinators, it's important to ensure there's always something available throughout the season.	"[""Preserving and Enhancing the Genetic Diversity of Southern Ontario Plants with Puslinch Naturally Native Trees\n“I love the winter time,” Marion Robertson says to me, over the speakerphone. She’s got the kettle on and lets me know that her husband and business partner Richard, may be popping in and out of the conversation. They are owners of Puslinch Naturally Native Trees, a nursery plant stock supplier. Now that the snow is thick on the ground, it’s the ideal time to do inventory and plan for the spring.\n“I can research other classes of plants and trees and spend the next year sourcing them,” she says.\nMarion shares a little about the origins of the business. They began as beekeepers (and still are). Richard chimes in, “We started growing trees, shrubs and wildflowers because of the honeybees and also endangered pollinators. You start out looking at one aspect; originally it was asking ourselves how we could help.”\nWith the best of intentions in mind, the couple purchased trees and shrub stock from local area nurseries. But what they discovered was that within a year, a good portion of these trees and shrubs had died.\nThe lesson learned? “A Latin, botanical name only ensures you are getting that specific plant. It does not indicate the origin of the seed,” Marion says. Plants from locally collected seeds have a much higher survival rate than those plants imported from outside an area’s growth zone.\n“It was next to impossible to find Carolinian or native stock from seed collected in our area at our local nurseries. That’s why we started our nursery business.”\nOn this cold, overcast morning, there are around 10,000 plants in pots sitting outdoors, all having sprung from local seed. What’s captivating my imagination is that all Marion and Richard’s seeds are hand collected, nothing bought, except for some from special reintroduction programs. A lot of their stock is Carolinian, endangered or uncommon larval pollinator plants that have disappeared from the landscape. As to be expected, this dedication to increasing the biodiversity of our southern Ontario landscape poses obvious challenges: the availability of stock, year by year is affected, due to adverse weather that impacts flowering and seed set.\nNo matter, the commitment is strong: “These native species were once a natural component of the landscape and need to, again, be a part of it,” Marion says. The pair also pick up local and heritage seed from the University of Guelph.\nMarion and Richard tell me that the value of most seeds is still not broadly appreciated. This is a very serious problem. For instance, they attribute canceling of funds to and subsequent closure of the Ontario Tree Seed Facility in Angus (by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry) to the undervaluing of seeds, and their true worth--as such, the facility ran a deficit.\n“Compared to the cost of gathering, cleaning and storage the seeds were not sold at a high enough price to offset costs,” Marion says. Something like Kentucky Coffee actually went for 27 cents a seed. A more fair price would be $1.”\nWhen the seed facility announced its closing, the bigger nurseries bought the surplus seeds. “This gave them a cushion for approximately one year,” Marion says. She predicts that once these reserves are gone there will be pressure on the industry to hire and train seed collectors; “So there will be opportunities in the future.”\nDriven to growing plants from original and ancient stock, Marion says she considers herself somewhat of “a sleuth,” venturing across various terrains to uncover these hardy seeds. She’s referring to the investigating she did on her search to find one particular 400-year-old oak located in the Niagara on the Lake region.\nOf course, that leads to the issue of ethical seed collecting. “You only want to take a percentage of the seeds you find, you have to leave some for natural regeneration,” Marion explains. She describes scenarios where some people have literally vacuumed masses of seeds up in one go. Furthermore, seeds collected this way prove to not be very resistant genetically: “a thousand seeds from three trees--but what have you really done?” she asks.\nIs there a specific time of year to actually collect seed, I wonder?\n“It depends on the species,” Richard interjects, surprising me by the sound of his voice--I thought he’d left. “For instance, you can pick serviceberries seeds in May; oaks you can pick their seeds up to the end of November.” He describes their catalog of plant stock as being “unique” and constantly evolving since they are always searching for new seed sources that will help preserve the genetic base of Ontario plants.\nAs a seed collector, Marion says the number one issue of concern is indeed, genetic resilience: “it goes beyond writing a plant list,” she says. Marion says the concept of purchasing seed from various nurseries when one is doing a planting, so as to enhance and diversify genetic biodiversity, has been lost. She believes that idea is worth bringing back, “We’ve got to change the way we get out there an buy, not just one big order from one nursery!” Rather, she would like to seem more “mom and pop operations,” the Conservation Authority playing a bigger role,\nSome other key factors to consider when it comes to genetic biodiversity is the longevity of species. “Take oak trees--they have suffered air pollution, climate change, and so on. Those are the trees we want to collect seed from.”\nClimate Change and Assisted Tree Migration\nOur conversation now turns to the frightening topic of climate change, and how, as Marion says, it is happening so much quicker than natural migration. From her research, derived from experts at Yale University, climatology papers and the forestry think tank at Sudbury to mention a few sources, she explains how trees grow in a “climate envelope,” and that they have evolved a rate of migration in response to glaciation.\n“Considering the glaciers only moved 1 inch a year the trees evolved just to stay ahead of the advancing ice,” Marion explains. She points out that the climate has changed and is predicted to change much faster than the rate of glacier movement, and that eventually, trees and ecosystems will have to move a projected 300 miles. Way beyond their ability.\n“On top of that, we have declining pollinator populations, and roads that are an environmental impediment in front of those natural migrations,” Marion says. “So we need to do it for them.”\nThat’s why, last year, Marion and Richard’s launched their “assisted tree migration” program.\n“The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources realizes that we are still stuck in seed zones--that are not relevant anymore, but they don’t know how to deal with it,” Marion says. “It’s going to have to be an industry based movement and in places like British Columbia, Quebec, Michigan, Minnesota have started to do this mitigation work.”\nIn creating plant stock that will be better suited to climate change, the hope is that these hardier plants will be able to survive and thrive in biodiverse plantings. This means growing tree stock that is wind and drought resistant in response to climate change. To this end, Marion talks about the necessity of having “wind action on trees.”\nMarion explains how when a tree that has been staked, that weakens its “bone structure.”\n“If trees don’t have a wind action on them, they won't learn to respond,” she says. “The first violent storm in their new habitat, they can’t withstand it. But people don’t want to buy crocked trees. They get upset if they see bit marks.”\nShe considers the onus for climate resilient trees falls “square on the lap of consumers” because it’s driven by consumers. “They want absolutely straight perfect trees,” she says. “But we have to get out of that “it has to be perfect” mentality” with its “colour of the year” and so on.”\nRather, people would do well to learn to “rejoice if you see things being eaten!”\nHow we can help\nNow it’s our turn. Let’s talk about what we can do in our yards and on our properties to up genetic biodiversity. Enter the “survival trees,” as Marion and Richard call them. In March and April, when nothing is blooming, Silver Maples are some of the first trees that pollinators will go to take the sugary water as food. Willow trees are also popular with pollinators; they are a great spring addition.\nIn planting for pollinators, Marion suggests working it so there is always something available; think goldenrods and asters, two plants that are “hugely critical” food sources because they last well into November. “The point is to do meaningful planting; plant with purpose,” Marion stresses. “Ask yourself, is it native, does it help endangered pollinators?”\nMore Useful Tips\nPlanting for the host critter in mind ex: native pipevine is the larval plant for the endangered Pipevine swallowtail butterfly.\nPlanting complimentary plants to extend feeding season of pollinators: For example, the added bonus is that the Ohio Buckeye and Kentucky Coffee trees bloom at different times, therefore, extending the feeding season for all pollinators.""]"	['<urn:uuid:733ff9f2-19b3-4a57-873e-34fc93d08fe7>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	14	53	1525

88	what is executive function in brain	Executive function is a set of mental skills that help you get things done. It is controlled by the frontal lobe, located in the top front part of the brain behind the forehead. These skills include working memory, mental flexibility, and self-control. Executive function enables us to plan, focus attention, remember instructions, carry out tasks, set goals, control impulses, and organize behaviors. It works like an air traffic control system, helping filter distractions and prioritize tasks.	['WHAT’S THE EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AND WHY IS SO IMPORTANT?\nThe set of mental skills that help you get things done is executive function. An area of the brain, the so called frontal lobe, is in charge of controlling these skills and is located in the top front part of the brain, right behind the forehead and continue its development through adolescence and into adult life. Many body functions are controlled by the frontal lobes, some of which are managing body movement (motor function), emotions, attention, motivation, and other thinking functions such as decision-making, judgment, abstract reasoning, planning and completing tasks, working memory (storing and using details to function), and meeting goals.\nExecutive function is a term used to describe the management of activities and derives from the business world. In other words, just as a manager decides, adjusts and supervises business activities, the frontal lobes are in charge of the body functions.\nWhat enables us to plan, focus attention, remember instructions, carry out a set of tasks are those mental processes known as executive function. The brain acts just as an air traffic control system at a busy airport. With the help of executive function it filters distractions, prioritize tasks, set and achieve goals, and control impulses.\nExecutive function also enables the brain to organize, self-monitor and control behaviors and multiple other cognitive functions, and to perform goal-directed behavior. These high level thinking skills manage and direct lower levels of cognitive functioning.\nWhat is interesting to notice is that although memory impaired people are often executively impaired, an individual may show no memory deficits but can be impaired as far as decision-making and executive functioning are concerned.\nExecutive function depends on three types of brain function: working memory, mental flexibility, and self-control. These functions are highly interrelated, and the successful application of executive function skills requires them to operate in coordination with each other.\n- Working memorycontrols our ability to retain and manipulate distinct pieces of information over short periods of time.\n- Mental flexibilityhelps us to maintain or shift attention in response to different commands or to apply different rules in different environments.\n- Self-control enables us to set priorities and resist impulsive actions or responses.\nSome people are born with weak executive function. Also, people with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), depression, or learning disabilities often have weaknesses in it. An injury to the front of the brain, where the frontal lobe is, can harm the individual’s ability to stay and concentrate on task. Problems may also be caused by Alzheimer’s disease or strokes.\nIt is no easy to identify problems since there is no single test to recognize executive dysfunction. Experts rely on different tests to measure specific skills. However, they can’t predict how well adults or children will perform in real life. Sometimes, watching them and trying different things are better ways to improve weak executive function. Some elder patients perform well on global tests of cognition; however, their behavior is disruptive not only to their lives but also to those of their families. What generates these behavior problems is not really understood, and thus, this kind of bad behavior is attributed to the personality of elder people.\nExecutive function can be divided into two groups:\n- Organization – Gathering information and structuring it for evaluation, For example: attention, planning, sequencing, problem-solving, working memory, cognitive flexibility, abstract thinking, rule acquisition, selecting relevant sensory information\n- Regulation – Assessing your surroundings and changing behavior in response to it. For example: initiation of action, self-control, emotional regulation, monitoring internal and external stimuli, initiating and inhibiting context-specific behavior, moral reasoning, decision-making.\nWhy is it important at the functional level?\nOn a practical level, impairments in executive functioning have been associated with impairments in activities of daily living which include getting dressed, the ability to feed oneself, bathe oneself and more. In other words, executive functions handle planning and paying attention to important needs and actions of the body. It includes: controlling, starting, stopping, regulating, adjusting to change, planning when faced with new settings or situations, forming ideas, storing information in and accessing it from working memory, controlling emotions, and thinking abstractly. Also, it is a function that helps people manage their time, pay attention, switch focus, multi task, remember details and avoid saying or doing the wrong thing. For example, to pay a bill, executive function includes choosing:\n♦ what to do (such as which bill to pay),\n♦ how long to do a current step (find the checkbook or log into the web page for that bill),\n♦ when to shift to the second step (such as fill in the details on the check or web page),\n♦ when to shift to the next step (such as checking the figures and other details on the check or web page and then sign your name), and\n♦ when to stop the completed task (such as put away the checkbook or close the web page) and then move on to a different activity.\nFeedback about the quality of each completed step should lead to improvements at that step or fixing any errors before finishing the whole task. When executive function isn’t working as it should, people’s behavior is less controlled. This can affect the ability to:\n- Work or go somewhere\n- Do things independently\n- Maintain relationships\nALTERATIONS IN THIS DIMENSION IN PATIENTS WITH ALZHEIMER’S DEMENTIA\nResearch has shown some decrease in executive function as people age. In the case of sudden injury to the frontal lobes such as in a stroke or a head injury from a fall, car accident, or sports injury, there may be sudden but not progressive loss of functions from this area of the brain. The frontal lobes are affected by Alzheimer’s disease, although it appears that early in the course of the illness there is a lot of frontal lobe activity which attempts to compensate for the damage. Persons diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease frontal lobe damage often lose their ability to sequence a task because they can no longer prioritize each segment of an activity.\nWhen there is slow progressive decline such as with Alzheimer’s disease, a frontal dementia, or a related progressive memory disorder, abilities may waver; some days the executive function may be better while other it may be worse. Slowly over time in a progressive dementia such as Alzheimer’s disease or frontal dementia, executive functions decline and a caregiver has to take over more of the related responsibilities. Brain cell changes that result in decline in executive function could interfere with memory, applying good judgment to choices, and paying attention long enough to a conversation to be able to respond appropriately.\nA new study finds that after memory begins to decline, executive function is the next brain function to deteriorate in the progression from mild cognitive impairment, a pre-Alzheimer’s disease condition, to Alzheimer’s disease. It is hard to make a decision if you cannot remember the important elements that are needed to go into that decision.\nIn general, among the elderly, measures of general cognitive ability are not consistently related to the capacity for independent functioning. Impaired executive functioning is common in dementia, but also may be present in the context of an age-related decline in the speed and capacity of information processing and varying levels of general cognitive impairment. Τhere are sufficient data concerning the so-called executive functions of the brain and their impairment in both normal aging and various types of dementia, to support the hypothesis that many behavioral disturbances among demented older adults are a function of different degrees of loss of the capacity to engage in purposeful, goal-directed activity.\nAccording to the results of another research, very mild AD patients differed significantly from controls on executive tasks (Self-Ordering task, Hukok Logical Matrices, Trail Making Test and verbal fluency test) that required concurrent manipulation of information, i.e., set shifting, self-monitoring, or sequencing tasks. Furthermore, the results show that impairment of executive function in very mild AD patients precedes the disturbance of sustained attention, language (oral comprehension, verbal abstraction and naming) and constructional abilities.\nSome reports, however, are in contradiction with executive dysfunction in the early stage of the disease. They claimed that, executive function is relatively spared in the early stage of the disease. Executive impairment was related to the severity and duration of AD. Similarly, other authors claimed that executive deficits simply reflect a moderate or severe cognitive deterioration.\nSERIOUS GAMES APPROPRIATE FOR THIS DIMENSION:\nIt is possible to use serious games to improve executive function or slow down its deterioration. Various scientific investigations reflect that certain activities like brain training game (Brain Age), popular puzzle game (Tetris) and board games help to improve the executive function. Apart from video games, some studies suggest that physical exercise can help improve executive functioning in people with dementia.\nIn the training materials of AD-GAMING we have selected some games that allow executive function to work:']	['<urn:uuid:bb86f7e2-9295-4e07-bd47-c5e9b8211fd0>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	6	76	1487
89	How long should disaster preparation last and what mental support exists?	For disaster preparation, communities should be prepared to sustain themselves for at least 72 hours (3 days) without outside assistance, including food, water, and medical necessities. For mental health support, there are effective treatments available for trauma and PTSD, including both medication and non-medication options, with healthcare professionals in communities ready to offer relief from its debilitating effects.	"['APHA\'s 2010 Get Ready Scholarship: Excerpts from winning essays\nSix students — at the high school, undergraduate and graduate college levels — were chosen from 900 applicants as the winners of APHA\'s 2010 Get Ready Scholarship. Below are excerpts from the winning essays.\n• Leah Wight— Golden Valley High School, Merced, Calif. (high school level)\nGeographically, the most probable natural disaster to occur where I live would be an earthquake. I live in the Central Valley of California, so I have experienced a mild earthquake or two. But I certainly haven\'t experienced anything even close to the same magnitude as the Haiti earthquake. This recent catastrophe has urged me to rethink my own family\'s earthquake disaster plans....Earthquake prevention is impossible, and earthquake prediction is near impossible. The only way we can protect ourselves is through planning and preparing. Earthquakes can shatter windows, destroy houses, annihilate entire cities, but they cannot eradicate my earthquake preparedness.\n• Courtney Farr — Robert L. Patton High School, Morganton, N.C. (high school level)\nGreat floods in the valley\nI live in the Foothills of North Carolina and happen to be in the direct vicinity of the large Catawba Valley. We do not receive a tremendous amount of precipitation, but when we do the rain usually comes in such large quantities, flooding seems almost inevitable...Based on my experiences and watching the devastating effects in my community, I am now more aware of the weather expected for my area. If another natural disaster such as a dangerous flood were to occur again, this time I would make sure to have a safe and effective plan and follow through to the best of my abilities...Ultimately, you have to know there is no way to stop a natural disaster, just be prepared for it the best you can and take the necessary precautions.\n• Brittany Voorhees — Holy Names University, Oakland, Calif. (undergraduate level)\nEarthquake reality: The first 72 hours\nLiving in Northern California, and the San Francisco Bay area specifically, there is always the potential for a significant seismic event. This is particularly true in both the area I live and the university I will be attending this fall as a junior. Living and going to school on two major active earthquake faults presents an ever-present awareness and challenge to prepare for the inevitable. The thought that ""it will never happen here,” simply is not a viable approach to follow. With this awareness comes the need to be prepared to survive for at least 72 hours without assistance from outside sources. This requires food, water, medical necessities and information on friends and fellow students on campus.\n• Delaney Moore — Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, Ind. (undergraduate level)\nWinter is the season for cold skies and warm, bacteria-filled buildings. People constantly find themselves overcome with illness. This is the time of the year when hygiene is most important, especially in a dorm setting where students are in close corridors. Preparation for the flu season as well as constant awareness and care throughout the flu season will result in less illness and life-changing habits. In the incident of an emerging epidemic, such as the recent H1N1 (outbreak), taking precautions is vital for protection. It\'s important to educate, supply and enforce hygiene behavior. At a college campus, many actions can be taken.\n• Tazeen Dhanani — George Mason University, Fairfax, Va. (graduate level)\nPrevention, preparation and partnership to fuel community readiness\nPublic health emergencies like natural disasters and infectious disease outbreaks are inevitable. Events such as fires, floods, earthquakes and hurricanes are disasters that people usually have very little to no control over, yet these disasters have the most impact on its victims and others indirectly affected by them...However, whether it is a devastating earthquake that affects the entire global community or a small house fire that (displaces) only a single family, the need for planning well in advance of these disasters will most effectively serve the victims\' needs. Having a plan and putting that plan into action during crises will prepare communities on a scale far superior and with more efficacy than having no plan at all.\n• Kristen Paz — Pepperdine University, Malibu, Calif. (graduate level)\nEarthquakes: Prepping for the aftermath of California’s faults\n...All Californians should ensure that their communities are prepared to sustain themselves for three days in the event of a major quake. Each family should have a preparedness plan. Creating guidelines on how to prepare should be a consolidated effort of the fire and police departments, county agencies, city officials and residents. Distributing these guidelines can be accomplished at city council meetings, via direct mail pieces and articles in local papers, neighborhood watch meetings and through local groups such as baseball and soccer leagues and YMCA. City engineers can advise on which areas are more likely to sustain higher levels of damage as they have a greater understanding of possible structure and soil issues.\nReturn to main Get Ready Scholarship page', 'June is PTSD Awareness Month. PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) is the official name of an injury listed in the DSM V (the most current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). Clinically, it’s considered a specific form of anxiety. Yet, in recent years it has been referred to as an invisible wound because of it being not readily visible by others who may be interacting with the person challenged by the symptoms. We now know it’s not just a psychological wound, but also an injury that’s been imposed on a person’s nervous system. Because of its covert existence, PTSD sometimes goes undetected for periods of time or can even be mistaken for other mental health illnesses because of its shared symptoms with those diagnoses. Though for those individuals whose lives are turned upside down by PTSD, it might be considered the “not-so-invisible” wound. The personality changes they undergo and the way their bodies respond to the impact are life-altering, sometimes creating distress that seems impossible to bear.\nIn order to erase the stigma behind what is officially a mental health illness, some in the healthcare profession have dropped the “disorder” and just say PTS. While a person’s life can be dis-ordered by the impact of trauma and they might actually feel physically ill by its presence, addressing PTS as the injury it is can lead to more accurate understanding and care. Excellent care for those wounded in this way is the most important reason to gain as much comprehension as possible. In our communities, that understanding can lead to the development of necessary resources for those that suffer from PTS.\n“…..for those persons whose lives are turned upside down by post-traumatic stress, PTSD might be considered the “not-so-invisible” wound”.\nRegardless it’s call-name, post-traumatic stress can be as debilitating as any physical injury suffered by someone. The impact can be life-changing, whether managed swiftly or lingering for years. If there are multiple traumatic event(s) or the trauma experienced is prolonged in nature, a healthcare provider may refer to the stress response as complex post-traumatic stress. Either diagnosis is accompanied by a litany of distressing changes in how the person copes with his/her life. Some of those changes might be physical in nature, such as severe sleep deprivation and even headaches or nausea when recalling the traumatic event. PTS can cause major changes in what we believe about ourselves and the world around us. One of the most uncomfortable changes is how our nervous system responds to being startled or while having even just having thoughts about the traumatic event(s). This is called hyper-arousal and happens when a person is triggered by something in their environment that has even the slightest resemblance to the original trauma. When a person’s life is stricken by these stresses, he/she is likely to do whatever possible to avoid reminders of the trauma. This avoidance may cause that person to change how they exist in the world by removing themselves from otherwise healthy socialization (isolation). The internal disruption caused by the PTS wound can leave someone feeling stuck on an emotional roller-coaster without escape. Called emotional dysregulation, this upheaval in their emotions is not only stressful for them, but can be equally overwhelming for anyone in proximity to the person suffering.\n“The internal disruption caused by the PTS wound can leave someone feeling stuck on an emotional roller-coaster without escape“.\nIn the United States, and in part as a result of the post-9/11 wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, PTS has received a much-needed increase in the attention it receives. Mental healthcare providers, desperate to encourage service members toward asking for help, have done remarkable work in advocating for treatment of PTS. Though anyone, regardless of the nature of trauma (rape, childhood abuse, near-death accidents or illness), could meet the criteria for PTS. Even being in long-term relationships with emotionally unsafe people is known to produce symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Thankfully, there are treatments that are effective in treating the injury. While medications may be prescribed as part of a treatment plan, there are multiple treatments available that do not require medication.\nIf you believe you or someone you care about is suffering from a PTS injury after being exposed to trauma, please consider reaching out to a healthcare professional in your community. There are people who know this wound is “not-so-invisible” to you and are able to offer relief from its debilitating effects.\nTo learn more about PTSD, please join me as I partner with PsychHub.com to educate about all mental health issues and available treatments.

As demand for protein is expected to require 25-70% more agricultural production by 2050, higher food prices will likely be needed. Simultaneously, environmental imperatives for planting trees are competing for the same land as cattle grazing, with carbon prices raising land values by around 35% in some regions. This dual pressure on land use suggests food prices will rise as biological sequestration competes with food production for available land.	"['Is the price of food catching up with energy?\nExploring the likely pathways of food versus energy commodities\n1. Will agriculture finally out-perform energy?\nThis Commentary explores the likely pathways of food vs. energy commodities in the 2020s and ‘30s. It explores key factors including renewable energy and synthetic food technologies that are likely to drive their relative performance. It concludes that prices of food commodities are likely to out-perform those of energy in the years ahead.\n2. Why may relative commodity prices matter in a post-Coronavirus world?\nThe world economy is currently reeling from the Coronavirus shock to the real economy (which via business losses will, in turn, hurt the financial and insurance industries). The responses of Governments to Coronavirus are significantly impacting discretionary sectors (particularly services)*. For example, it is estimated 25% of jobs in the UK are likely to be either made redundant or furloughed in 2020.\n* See the Craigmore commentary “Analysing a Possible Coronavirus Recession”\nTo counter falls (estimated at an annual rate of 10% to 20% for at least two quarters) in GDP of the advanced economies, widespread income support is being made available by governments to citizens. In the UK it is likely that the income of approximately 5 million citizens will be supported by the government to maintain their solvency and some of their spending power.\nFor this period the productive capacity of the UK economy will be smaller (due to the lost services of e.g. restaurants and tourism that were until very recently part of GDP). If we assume that those who are supported do not save all the hand-outs, the question then arises; on which goods and services will citizens spend this borrowed (or will it be printed) income?\nPutting it another way, since citizens will not be able to spend as much on foreign holidays or restaurants this year, where will they spend that part of their income they do not use to repair their bank accounts?\nAs before they will of course spend some of it on consumer staples, like food and energy. As before, if well supplied, prices of these will not necessarily increase. However, if the supply of energy or food falls short in coming months, then it is likely a population with the same spending power as before yet fewer things on which to spend it, may bid up any such “tight” commodities.\nThis is the reason why we focus in this Commentary on the likely path of supply and demand for commodities, to seek to identify which are likely to remain abundant, and which might go into short supply?\n3. What has been the history of food commodities vs oil?\nThe graph below plots the relative performance of oil, as the benchmark energy commodity, vs. a simple basket of US$ spot prices of Corn, Wheat, Soy, Live Cattle and Milk over the 50 years since 1970.\nAs can be seen oil significantly out-performed food commodities for most of this period creating a shift in the allocation of world incomes to the oil sector. While the wealth and influence of rural landowners languished. Basically “Dallas” replaced “Downton Abbey”.\nMore recently, however, oil prices have “returned to earth”. Indeed, as can be seen in the graph, indices of energy and food are level-pegging again in 2020, for the first time in 50 years (in fact this graph is a 2-year moving average showing an oil price of around $35. In fact, oil has traded as low as $20 in the last few days).\nFigure 1: After 1970 oil outperformed food – until 2020\nLooking more closely at the (less volatile) price of food commodities these spiked in 2010-2013 (a period of US and Russian droughts coming immediately after the world had eaten up the subsidy driven excess food stocks of the ‘80s and ‘90s). At the peak of this short boom prices had doubled to approximately twice their 2007 levels. They have since fallen back 25% when measured in US$.\nThe US$ has however risen more than 25% since then against many currencies (the US$ TWI index has risen 26% from 102 to 129 in the six years since 2014). As a result, as can be seen in the graph below, farm-gate prices received by most non-US farmers, including in New Zealand after its currency softened over the past three years (as it brought interest rates into line with those of other countries), are right “on trend” i.e. close to as good as they have ever been.\nFigure 2: NZ$ (blue) vs US$ (red) Dairy Prices\n4. What drives the “terms of trade” of commodities?\nPrices of both energy and food commodities are of course primarily determined by changes in the volumes of supply and demand. Increases in productive capacity should lower prices whereas increases in demand for a commodity should lift them. Until 1970 this situation applied in both the oil and the food markets. Large numbers of oil companies and large numbers of farmers competed to supply their commodities to growing markets. And large numbers of consumers paid intermediaries (oil and food companies) for the respective end products. This “Adam Smithian” arrangement remains the case in the (highly fragmented) agricultural markets i.e. prices there continue to be driven almost entirely by supply and demand. Particularly by supply since food demand tends to be fairly constant whereas production varies in the short term as a result of climatic, political and economic events (including, we may soon discover, measures designed to protect human health but which have unintended consequences in terms of labour supply to agriculture, and hence food production).\nHowever, from 1970, the energy markets were transformed when the major oil exporting nations, led by Saudi Arabia, began to influence supply, not in the traditional way (by allowing many companies to each make their own capacity decisions) but by “rigging the market” via the OPEC oil cartel. The cartel actively restricted supply to lift oil prices from $3 per barrel in 1970 to $40 by 1980. Such has been (until recently) the concentration of global supply of oil from the Middle East, that OPEC was able to heavily influence movements in the price of oil for 44 years, from 1970 until 2014. However, as can be seen from the brown line on the graph, since 2014 the price of oil has significantly fallen, especially in the past 10 weeks (when it has fallen from $63 per barrel for WTI Crude on 6th Jan to a price range between $20 and $30 in March, 2020).\n2014 was the year that oil (and gas) from fracking began to surge and put the US on track to become the largest oil producer in the world and a net energy exporter (which was achieved in 2019). This pressure, plus the rise of cheap and attractive renewable energy alternatives has effectively broken the OPEC cartel, further damaged by the withdrawal of Russia as an OPEC observer and ally. It seems likely, now that there are many competing suppliers each making their own decisions on volume of production, oil prices will return to being set, “at the cost of marginal production” (presumably of extraction via fracking in the US mid-west, west and south). Given how rapidly fracking and renewable energy technologies and regulations are advancing, it does not seem likely that these supply (and demand) decisions, at the margin, are now going to drive up the price of oil.\nTherefore, I conclude that abundant supplies of energy make it unlikely the current crisis will lead to sharp rises in prices of oil or other energy commodities. On the contrary, energy and especially oil are likely to remain cheap (and in so doing create a transfer of wealth from energy exporting countries to net importers). Before discussing prospects for food commodities in Section 6, the next Section will review the historic correlation of the two sets of commodity prices.\n5. Are farm commodity prices correlated with oil?\nAs we saw in the previous section, in the 1970s oil prices increased by over 12x. Over the same period farm commodity prices increased by 2.5x. In the 1960s and 1970s a “green revolution” in crop production was sweeping world farming, raising yields and efficiency via improved genetics, fertiliser and machinery. This meant that, although farm commodities kept pace with the high inflation of that decade (the US CPI also increased by 2x during that decade) they did not outperform in line with oil.\nAs can be seen in the graph below, this period of significant out-performance by oil in the 1970s was then replaced by 30 years, from 1984 until 2014, when oil and food commodities traded in lock-step. There were good reasons for that. The green revolution had made farming so efficient that in some countries the price of ethanol from crops was cheaper than that of ethanol from oil. The produce of the two industries traded on an effective “wholesale energy equivalence” basis for most of those three decades.\nFrom 2014, as noted, farm commodities, although soft (down about 25% in US$ terms), significantly outperformed oil, which fell 75% from $100 per barrel in early 2014 to, say, $25 today.\nFigure 3: Relatively Weak Correlation > Strong Correlation > Weak\nMight food prices now revert to their previous high level of correlation, i.e. “follow oil down”? This is the topic of the next sections.\n6. Supply factors for foods\nWe farmers are our own worst enemies. For two centuries we have over-produced and lowered our terms of trade:\nIn the nineteenth century we discovered the “new world” prairies, invented refrigeration, and massively lowered farm relative incomes (from about 70% to 10% of GDP) as a result.\nIn the last century we added only very little new land, and this continues. However, we have adopted technology after technology to produce more grain, meat and dairy from each of those hectares. These techniques have also increased productivity per labour unit and per $ of capital employed. Meanwhile subsidies to farmers in most wealthy countries protected farms against the odd bad harvest – encouraging further over-production.\nThose two centuries period of declining terms of trade for agriculture ended up in the year 2000 with farmers being rewarded, as the rest of the economy grew but our share did not, with farm incomes of less than 1% of GDP in the industrialised west.\nHowever, pleasingly for us farmers in the first 20 years of this century this “fall” in real prices of farm produce has levelled off and indeed real prices of farm produce has increased (the graph below replicates the indices from the first graph but deflated by US$ inflation i.e. shown as real prices).\nWhat is the reason for this improvement in farmers’ pricing power?\nFigure 4: Inflation Adjusted Commodity Indices\nThe two main reasons for improvements in real farm produce prices are:\nYield growth per hectare, while still increasing for some crops (e.g. US corn or NZ dairy), has stabilised across much of the farming sector e.g. average European cereal yields per hectare have been “stuck” at 7 tonnes for 20 years (graph below).\nFigure 5: Western European Cereal Yields\nDiets are significantly changing around the world as, for example, the E Asian middle-class rockets from 500 m people in the year 2010 to 1.5 bn now and heading to 3 bn in 2030. Despite concerns in the west with health and the environmental impacts of animal protein, these newly wealthy people want infant formula, yogurt, cheese, pizzas, chicken nuggets and hamburgers just as do their counterparts in the west. And, since average protein consumption in many of these countries is below the levels experts believe are optimal, it is hard to see how rich western countries, even if they are able to bring down their own (in many cases excessive) consumption of “land intensive” proteins, are going to be able to prevent the populations of these countries gaining the health benefits of moderate amounts of protein in their diets? Since it takes a lot more land to grow animal rather than vegetable protein estimates are that the production of the world farming industry will need to grow by 25-70% by 2050. In order to persuade the “marginal producer” of food to deliver this increase it is likely higher prices will be needed.\n7. Substitutes for “farmed foods”\nHopefully, for environmental reasons, some of the demand of this emerging middle class for protein will be met with synthetic foods, e.g. re-constituted soy into burgers, oats into milk substitute. However, it seems unlikely, as plant based and highly processed foods seldom have the same nutritional density as animal protein, that these synthetic proteins will take over the roles of especially the low-cost parts of the current protein value chain i.e. dairy farming (cheese and fresh milk are after all a big part of the diet of most vegetarians) and also white meat production. We will discuss red meat in the next and final section, below.\n8. Environmental factors\nMankind’s attempts to combat climate change are driving energy innovation to reduce energy costs and substitute production away from fossil fuels. As discussed in Section 2 this is likely to lower the terms of trade of energy products, especially fossil fuels such as oil.\nMany urge a parallel shift in protein production from livestock systems to vegetable protein and synthetic foods. And especially away from red meat, since ruminant animals are more polluting per kg of nutrition than animal protein from dairy, poultry or fish. If implemented (as discussed not all of an emerging middle class will accept limitations on their right to beneficial nutrition) this may, other things equal, also be a negative for the equilibrium prices of conventionally grown food.\nHowever, as readers will be aware, there are simultaneous environmental imperatives for planting trees. Conveniently these are most suited to the same class of land (extensive rangelands) that grow cattle. This fact may make the environmental calculus for farming different from fossil fuels. There are no other uses for oil wells and refineries than to produce and then distil their production into a series of chemicals, most of which will be burned. Forestry and other forms of biological sequestration (e.g. low input, low stocking rate regenerative farming to sequester carbon into pastoral soils) represent viable alternative land-uses in a world that is seeking to address climate change. Therefore, if a reduction in demand for farmed red meat does eventuate, then prices of these and other agriculture products will only fall if demand for land shifted to biological sequestration does not fully off-set reductions in demand for land for red meat.\nTo illustrate this point with a brief case study; Craigmore Sustainables, on behalf of our investors, has been an active purchaser of marginal sheep and beef country in NZ for afforestation i.e. livestock have been retired from this land and it has been planted with trees. The rise in the NZ carbon price (to around NZ$25 per tonne) over the past three years has lifted the price of such land from around $8,000 per hectare (fair value for pure sheep and beef growing) to now around $11,000 (fair value to forestry investors). If this approx. 35% gain in economic returns and land valuations is reflected in other regions as environmental measures are rolled out, we may find land use industries no longer accrue such a derisory share of GDP. It seems logical to this author, and borne out by NZ’s carbon forestry experience, that if mankind really wants to address climate change (and we must) then society will need to reward farmers with more than 1% of GDP. As soon as this is done then, as argued in the Craigmore commentary In “Praise of Trees”, the farm/forest industry is ready and willing to use our skills to off-set climate change using some of our land to sequester carbon, and enabling us to either sell the credits from this or, indeed, to produce carbon neutral produce.\nShifts in tastes toward (more land intensive) animal protein as well as population growth itself are forecast to require an approx. 50% extra production from the same amount of land in the next 30 years. This is achievable, but it seems logical that society, especially if we wish to raise our game to address climate change, will need to pay farmers more than the 1% of developed country GDP to get this.\nIt is too early to know whether the Coronavirus slump and massive governmental fiscal and monetary responses to it are likely to cause inflation (this risk will be the subject of a future Commentary), however, the above analysis suggests that if this occurs it is foodstuffs, not energy (or at least not fossil transport fuels i.e. oil) that would be more likely to exhibit those rising prices.\nEnvironmental imperatives do not, I believe, change this analysis since biological sequestration will compete with food for land resources, further “tightening” capacity of the global farming industry.\nIt is these factors, which may lift the real prices of farm produce in coming years, that should allow farm commodities to continue the break in their historic correlation with energy prices, which already began with the scaling up of fracking and renewable energy substitution, from 2014.', ""Agro-forestry, as defined by the World Agro-forestry Centre, is “a dynamic, ecologically based, natural resources management system that, through the integration of trees on farms and in the agricultural landscape, diversifies and sustains production for increased social, economic, and environmental benefits for land users at all levels”. On the other hand, the Association for Temperate Agro-forestry describes it as “an intensive land management system that optimises the benefits from the biological interactions created when trees and/or shrubs are deliberately combined with crops and/or livestock” (IGUTEK, 2011). Agro-forestry offers great potential for carbon sequestration (UNFCCC, 2008).\nIn addition to mitigation benefits, agro-forestry can also address the need for improved food security and increased energy resources, as well as the need to sustainably manage agricultural landscapes. These functions of agro-forestry are described in the article 'Agro-forestry (adaptation) '.\nTerrestrial sequestration is based on the fact that plants take CO2 out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis and store it as organic carbon in above-ground biomass (trees and other plants) and in the soil through root growth and the incorporation of organic matter (figure 1). Thus, the process of carbon loss through land use change can be reversed, at least partially, through improved land use and management practices. In addition to afforestation, changes in agricultural land management, such as the adoption of tillage practices that reduce soil disturbance and incorporate crop residues into the soil, can remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the soil as long as those land use and management practices are maintained. Agro-forestry systems will vary by region. However, crops and forests together will elevate the carbon conserving capacity of the agro-ecosystem of a region.\nAgro-forestry is one of the important terrestrial carbon sequestration systems. It involves a mixture of trees, agricultural crops, and pastures to exploit the ecological and economic interaction of an agro-ecosystem. Agro-ecosystems play a central role in the global carbon cycle and contain approximately 12% of world terrestrial carbon (Dixon, 1995). Increased C sequestration by agro-forests is an important element of a comprehensive strategy to reduce GHG emissions. According to Richards and Stokes (2004), forest land can fix about 250 million metric tonnes of carbon each year (12% of total CO2 emissions), crop land can sequester about 4-11% of atmospheric C/yr, and grazing land can sequester about 5% of atmospheric C/yr in the USA. The system of planting trees in strategic locations on farms to compensate for the lost carbon due to cutting of trees for agriculture is called agro-forestry. It has the biggest potential for increasing agricultural carbon sequestration in tropical countries (Youkhana and Idol, 2009).\nIncreasing agroforestry may involve practices that increase emissions of GHGs including shifting cultivation, pasture maintenance by burning, paddy cultivation, N fertilisation, and animal production. On the other hand, several studies have shown that including trees in agricultural landscapes often improves the productivity of systems while providing opportunities to create C sinks (Albrecht and Kandji, 2003). The trees play various functions, including shading crops, erosion control, and nutrient cycling. Shading crops and the rhizosphere by the trees would significantly reduce evapotranspiration (ET) of the cropped area although overall ET of crops plus trees may increase. The soil organic carbon content increases at the rate of 50kg ha-1 yr-1 in the top 10cm depth of an improved forestry plantation of Cassia siamia where the high rate of litter fall under Cassia (5 to 7 Mg ha-1 yr-1) helps to maintain high soil organic carbon content (Lal et al., 1998b).\nBamboo is an especially effective agro-forest sink of CO2 with a C sequestration rate as high as 47% amounting to 12-17 t CO2 per hectare per annum. It also generates 35 per cent more oxygen than other timber species (Aggarwal, 2007). Additionally, bamboo plantations generate income, provide a livelihood for forest dependent people. Degraded lands can be used for plantations of fast growing clones of bamboo species up to an altitude of 1,800m. Bamboo grows much faster than other trees with some species growing up to 150ft in just six weeks, occasionally more than 4ft per day. Bamboo is a pioneering plant that can also grow in over grazed soil using poor agricultural techniques (Aggarwal, 2007).\n- Trees act as a buffer against storms to prevent crop destruction.\n- Dry land forests apparently manage to sequester carbon by reducing respiration rates and growing rapidly in early spring to take advantage of temperatures most favorable for growth (Rotenberg and Yakir, 2010).\n- Trees send their roots considerably deeper than crops, thereby placing organic matter at deeper depths in the soil where tillage won’t accelerate its decomposition and the release of CO2. In some instances trees have extracted water from deeper depths which has become redistributed at shallower depths with positive effects on the growth of understory plants. In other cases of negative effects have also been reported, so the phenomenon remains controversial (Prieto, et al., 2012). While such redistributions could be ecologically important, allowing some species to survive that would otherwise perish, it is less clear that the amounts of water involved would enable significant increases in the yield of agronomic crops.\n- Leaf litter generates compost and serves as mulch that reduces runoff from rainfall. It also slows soil water loss from evaporation into the atmosphere.\n- Agro-forestry trees also improve land cover in agricultural fields in addition to providing carbon inputs (root biomass, litter and pruning) to the soil. These often reduce soil erosion, which is a crucial process in soil carbon dynamics.\n- Carbon sequestration continues beyond harvest if boles, stems, or branches are processed into durable products that do not decompose and release CO2.\n- An agro-forestry induced micro-climate improves quality and increases the yield of some crops, although it is difficult to provide an estimation of the yield increase (Ebeling and Yasue, 2008).\n- Increasing soil carbon greatly benefits agricultural productivity and sustainability.\n- Cost of carbon sequestration through agro-forestry appears to be much lower than through other CO2 mitigating options (Albrecht and Kandji, 2003).\n- This technology involves a very slow process of marginal carbon conservation.\n- Soil carbon increases only in drier sites and actually decreases in wetter sites of agro-forestry regions (Jackson et al., 2002). As a result, the net carbon balance was marginally positive for the dry sites but negative for the wet sites.\n- Under dry environments, the tree-crop competition for water usually results in low crop yields, which makes this technology unattractive for dryland farmers. Under dryland conditions, trees with their effective rooting systems take more water compared to crops with relatively less effective rooting systems, so the crops are more vulnerable to water stress with consequent lower yields (Schroeder, 1995).\n- Various species of damaging insects, pests, and diseases have been associated with dead or dying trees. These are a major threat to the development of agro-forestry in the tropics.\n- Emissions of other greenhouse gases such as N2O and CH4 in the atmosphere may increase, which reduces overall mitigation potential.\nAgro-forestry is practiced to some extent all over the world. It is especially used for crops that benefit from the quality improvements associated with shading. However, the other benefits, including carbon sequestration, are being more recognised, and agro-forestry appears to be growing in popularity.\nLight is a limiting factor for crop production in agroforestry system, and most crops yield less when shaded with higher plants. Therefore, unless the several advantages such as quality improvement and carbon sequestration can overcome the yield depression, agro-forestry is not likely to become widespread. In addition, most farmers have the equipment to accommodate only a few similar crops. Adapting to growing both small stature and large stature tree crops presents a greater challenge for them.\nTakimoto et al. (2008) experimented with two types of agro-forestry systems (live fence and fodder bank) at the Segou region, Mali. The live fence treatment showed US $96 net present value (NPV), 1.53 benefit cost ratio (BCR) and 25.5% internal rate of return (IRR), while fodder bank project showed $159 NPV, 1.67 BCR and 29.5% IRR.\nPromotion of agro-forestry can reduce the amount of carbon emitted to the atmosphere annually by 700,000 million tonnes. This can happen due to controlled grazing, fire management, use of fertilisers, improved cultivars, and re-vegetation of reclaimed lands.\nAccording to Rotenberg and Yakir (2010), agro-forestry in semi-arid regions can sequester as much carbon as forests in temperate regions. Every tonne of carbon added to and stored in plants or soils removes 3.6 tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere.\nAccording to Lal et al. (1998a), a small agro-forestry enterprise following nutrient recapitalisation had a cost of $87 per tonne of carbon sequestered in East African Highlands. Sudha et al. (2007) carried out a costbenefit analysis of baseline (chili crops – best alternative to agro-forestry and the dominant pre-plantation crop) and agro-forestry (Eucalyptus clones) scenarios in the Khammam district, India. Costs and benefits under both the scenarios can be seen in figure 3.\nAggarwal, A.

91	How many aircraft could the modernized USS Midway carry?	After its 1963 modernization, the USS Midway could carry about sixty aircraft, increased from about forty aircraft.	"['With advanced targeting, missiles and other advanced tools at the disposal of rising and resurging adversaries, the U.S. Navy must rethink the way it structures its carrier fleet with an emphasis on legacy full-scale aircraft carriers and a new breed of smaller carriers, the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessment (CSBA) says in a recent report.\n“The Navy should also pursue a new “high/low mix” in its aircraft carrier fleet,” CSBA says in its report, CSBA “Restoring American Seapower, A New Fleet Architecture for The United States Navy,” released Feb. 9.\n“Traditional nuclear-powered supercarriers remain necessary to deter and defeat near-peer competitors, but other day-to-day missions, such as power projection, sea lane control, close air support, or counterterrorism, can be achieved with a smaller, lower cost, conventionally powered aircraft carrier,” CSBA says “Over the next five years, the Navy should begin transitioning from large deck amphibious ships into smaller aircraft carriers with the goal of delivering the first such ship in the mid-2030s.”\nThe CSBA refers to the ships as light aircraft carrier (CVL), saying it “initially be a legacy LHA/LHD, but eventually replaced by a purpose-built 40,000- to 60,000-ton CVL with catapults and arresting gear.”\nWhen the Navy modernized the USS Midway in 1963, CSBA notes, it added catapults, arresting gear, and an angled deck. “This grew the displacement of the ship from 40,000 tons to 60,000 tons and increased its aircraft capacity from about forty to about sixty aircraft. The proposed CVL would not be as large as the modernized USS Midway, but between the two versions in terms of aircraft capacity.”\nAs the Navy builds CVLs with catapults and arresting gear, CSBA says, the CVL air wing will evolve to add one to two unmanned aerial vehicles (UCAVs), one to two utility/tanker unmanned vehicles, one to two electronic warfare (AEW) aircraft, and electronic attack (AEA) aircraft needed “for the threat environment. This evolution will require Navy-Marine Corps air wing integration, as is done today in CVN (traditional carrier) CVWs (carrier air wings).”\nThe CSBA offers an example for CVL operational concepts.\n“The Deterrence Force in the Philippine Sea and Western Pacific, would be centered on the CVL (or LHA/LHD) from the ARG (amphibious readiness group) associated with the small-deck amphibious ships inside the first island chain. CVL strike-fighters would conduct strike, SUW (surface warfare), and ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) operations to help deny Chinese aggression inside the South and East China Seas or attack Chinese naval and other targets outside the first island chain. It is to be expected that the CVL would be targeted and attacked by China’s reconnaissance-strike complex in time of war, so this Deterrence Force would include DDGs (guided-missile destroyers) to protect the CVL and a modified Counter-ISR Group to reduce the effectiveness of Chinese targeting.”\nIn the wake of the release of the CSBA report, which was done for and with the help of Defense Department and naval officials, Adm. John Richardson, the chief of naval operations, refrained from releasing official comments about some of the recommendations in the report, but released the following general statement:\n“""The Navy is at an inflection point where we are back in competition. Many of the ideas from these studies will help us win that competition. To win, our thinking must sharp and these studies help us - they give us exactly what we want...some fresh ideas. Each study provided ideas that in some cases validated and advanced the Navy\'s current thinking. Some of the recommendations from the studies are so sound that we will act on them quickly. Other ideas show promise and we\'ll study those hard. The studies will be rolled into our program of analysis, war games, experiments, technology demonstrations, and prototyping.""\n----Michael Fabey is a Scout Warrior Pentagon Correspondent----']"	['<urn:uuid:572753a1-8fa7-40c3-944a-5bef43afb802>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	9	17	627
92	Do Dutch elm disease and Phomopsis spread similarly through water movement?	While both diseases can spread through water, they have different mechanisms. Phomopsis tip blight is primarily spread by splashing rain, wind, insects, or mechanical means, especially during periods of high humidity and wet foliage. In contrast, Dutch elm disease primarily spreads through elm bark beetles that transport fungal spores, or through root systems when infected roots graft together with healthy trees' roots.	['Juniper tip blight is a common disease of junipers found in most states east of the Mississippi River. There are many varieties of junipers susceptible to tip blights; however, the disease is most serious on young or newly transplanted plants. As the plant matures, disease susceptibility and severity decreases. Occasionally it can infect arborvitae, cedar, European larch, jack pine, and Douglas-fir. The two most common juniper tip blight diseases are Phomopsis juniperovora (Phomopsis tip blight) and Kabatina juniperi (Kabatina tip blight).\nPhomopsis tip blight\nPhomopsis tip blight, sometimes referred to as juniper twig blight, is mainly a leaf and shoot infection that affects the new, young foliage of junipers. The first symptoms, yellow spots on young needles, may occur 3-5 days after infection. (Sometimes older needles may also show spotting.) The fungus then enters young stem tissue causing dieback of the new shoot tips. Affected foliage turns dull red to brown and then ash gray. As the disease progresses, small lesions (cankers) form on the stems where infected and healthy tissue meet. Eventually the entire branch may die. Infection is spread primarily by splashing rain, wind, insects, or mechanical means. Repeated infections occur when temperatures are between 70 - 80 degrees F, during periods of high humidity, and when foliage is wet. The fungus can persist in dead parts of infected plants for as long as two years.\nKabatina tip blight\nKabatina causes symptoms very similar to Phomopsis, but usually only infects twigs a year or more old. This fungus does not infect healthy foliage, but enters through wounds caused by pruning, insects, or severe winter weather. The first symptoms, dull green then red or yellow discoloration of branch tips, appears in February and March, well before symptoms of Phomopsis tip blight appear. As the disease progresses, spores are formed in the small, ash-gray lesions (cankers) found at the junction between infected and healthy tissue. The brown, dried foliage eventually drops from the plant in late May or June. Kabatina tip blight occurs only in the early spring and does not cause extensive branch die back. The primary infection period for the Kabatina fungus is autumn, even though symptoms are not apparent until late winter or early spring.\nAlthough Phomopsis and Kabatina blights cause almost identical symptoms, their stages of development and control differ. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between the two.\n- Plant trees and shrubs that are resistant to Phomopsis and Kabatina tip blight.\n- When planting, avoid heavily shaded areas and space plants to allow for good air circulation.\n- Avoid wounding plants, especially in spring and fall.\n- Water plants in early morning so foliage will dry during the day.\n- Prune out diseased branch tips during dry summer weather and destroy.\n- If the infection is severe, removal of the plant may be necessary. Replace with a resistant tree selection.\n- Avoid excessive pruning or shearing.\nContact the Plant Clinic (630-719-2424 or firstname.lastname@example.org) for current recommendations.

Reference to commercial products or trade names is made with the understanding that no discrimination is intended and no endorsement made by The Morton Arboretum.', 'Dutch Elm Disease\nDutch elm disease is caused by a fungus (Ophiostoma novo-ulmi; O. ulmi) that affects elm trees, primarily the American elm (Ulmus americana). The fungus grows in the xylem layer of the tree, blocking the movement of water and nutrients, which eventually girdles and kills the tree. The fungus is transported to host trees on elm bark beetles which feed on the bark, creating wounds through which the fungus spores can enter the tree. The fungus can also move through the root system of diseased trees into the roots of adjacent trees if the roots have grafted together.\nsigns and symptoms\nSymptoms develop quickly, usually within 4-5 weeks after infection. The first visual symptom is called “flagging”, which is when the leaves on one or more branches begin wilting and yellowing. Flagging may begin in a discrete part of the crown but can rapidly spread to all branches. Eventually, the leaves may die and fall. Brown streaking can be seen under the bark in the xylem. This brown discoloration looks like a circle of brown dots when observed in a cross section.\nSee image slideshow above for signs and symptoms.\nDutch elm disease was first described in Holland in 1921, although it is thought to have originated in Asia. It was introduced into the United States in the 1930’s on diseased timber from Europe. It rapidly spread across the country, reaching the west coast in 1973. Since its arrival, it has killed over 40 million American elm trees and has proven to be one of the most destructive shade tree diseases in North America.\nThe fungus reproduces through spores that are stored in the xylem of the host tree. Bark beetles burrow through the bark into the wood to lay their eggs, and in that process spores become attached to their bodies. When the beetles travel to a new elm tree, they transport the fungal spores and thus spread the pathogen. The pathogen can also spread between root systems of trees if they are planted close enough together to allow root grafting. From the point of inoculation, the fungus moves up and down the trunk through the xylem. Once the fungus reaches the root system, it may ascend the trunk in a wave of infection that kills the whole tree or a major section of it.\nThe American elm tree was an important forest and urban tree in North America, up until the early 1900’s. Its form and tolerance of the urban environment made it a favored street tree across the United States. It was also a prominent species in bottomland forests, greatly contributing to the health of riparian ecosystems. Since the disease’s arrival in the 1930’s, over 40 million American elm trees have been killed, and today it continues to suppress the population of elm trees in forested ecosystems. American elms can still be found in forests since the tree is a prolific seed producer and grows quickly, allowing many trees to bear seed before succumbing to the disease.\nCheryl Kaiser, University of Kentucky, Bugwood.org\nGeorge Hudler, Cornell University, Bugwood.org\nUK Forestry Commission, Bugwood.org\nWilliam M.

93	How does artificial intelligence improve animal monitoring in aquaculture, and what security measures are needed to protect these digital tracking systems?	Artificial intelligence in aquaculture, as implemented in the iFarm project, enables real-time monitoring of individual fish through multiple camera angles, creating individual health records for each fish. The system includes sophisticated camera arrangements, lighting, and data processing capabilities to track fish welfare and behavior. Regarding security measures, such digital systems require comprehensive protection. Organizations must implement security-by-design principles, conduct continuous auditing, and maintain appropriate security measures to protect both informational and operational data. They need to detect and respond to security incidents promptly, and ensure system resilience against various cyber threats like data manipulation and content theft.	"['The first iFarm fish on the way to market\nThe results from the harvest show high quality of the iFarm fish, which confirms that the health and welfare of the fish has been good in the iFarm net pens. The very first iFarm fish was stocked in Martnesvika sea site in the autumn of 2020.\nUsing artificial intelligence and machine learning, Cermaq and BioSort aim to identify each individual fish in a pen and give individual follow-up and health journals. The iFarm project, which will develop individual aquaculture, is planned to run over five years. In phase 1, the main task has been adapting the iFarm equipment in the pen to the fish\'s behavior and ensuring that the fish are well and have good welfare.\n""The fish behavior we have observed in phase 1 tells us that the fish is doing fine with the iFarm equipment in the pen. This is further supported by the results from the harvest. The fish has had a good life in the iFarm pens,"" says Cermaq’s iFarm project manager, Karl Fredrik Ottem\nThe need for delousing was reduced by 50% in the iFarm pens compared to the conventional pens on the site and scoring of welfare indicators was good throughout the production.\nThe iFarm project is a development project with a high degree of innovation, and with many uncertainties. The iFarm concept cannot be combined with ordinary underwater feeding equipment, and the harvest results showed that there is a need for further development of the underwater feeding system to achieve as good feeding factor as we normally have in Cermaq. The first production has also provided important experience in terms of solutions for integration between various main components of iFarm and how these should be further developed to improve handling operations and daily operations.\nAlso, the first version of the iFarm sensor has been tested in phase 1 in Martnesvika sea site, which has resulted in important experiences regarding the camera arrangement, lighting, and data processing to enable a health record for each fish. ""Checking the fish in real time with cameras from multiple angles opens up to tell more about each fish, but at the same time it requires a lot from the software and hardware solutions we develop,"" says general manager of BioSort, Geir Stang Hauge.\nThe further development of iFarm - phase 2 - is taking place in Vesterålen. An entire sea site has been equipped with iFarm setups in all the pens, after the fish was stocked last autumn. In this phase, there will be real full-scale testing of the concept and technology.\n""We have learned a lot that we have already implemented in phase 2, and we have received a number of answers that take us to the next step. An important part of the innovation work is to find out what works and what does not work "", says Ottem.\nThe first iFarm fish was harvested at Steigen processing plant and has been sent to customers in Europe and Asia.', 'Keeping transport safe, secure, and sustainable\nKeeping transport safe, secure, and sustainable\nWhether by rail, road, air, or sea, transport and logistics systems play a critical role in supporting the global infrastructure network. Today’s transportation systems are more sophisticated than ever, comprising complex plans, large volumes of real-time information, and connectivity through the industrial internet of things (IIoT).\nCybersecurity for the transportation sector faces two primary challenges:\nThe digitisation of railway systems, such as the European signaling ERTMS system (European Rail Traffic Management System), has made public transport systems vulnerable to a new generation of cybersecurity threats. In 2020 alone, ransomware attacks on the global transportation industry saw a 186% increase year-over-year.\nThese challenges require continuous updating of cybersecurity practices and new methodologies to keep transport systems agile. Failure to take action can be costly and disruptive, potentially exposing organisations to liability and legal action, particularly when customer data breaches are involved.\nAs global transportation and logistics networks continue to evolve alongside the rise of new technologies, organisations like yours must recognise the importance of cyber resilience and its ability to protect cargo and passengers.\nResilience to cybersecurity attacks requires more than just creating controls and processes. Your transport firm’s resilience begins and ends with the people in charge of data and assets. From IT personnel to executives, every employee must adopt a cybersecurity-first mindset. This means recognising that people are the first line of defence against threats. Through training and inhouse workshops, safety and security can be at the heart of your practises and corporate culture.\nThe rapid digitalisation of transport networks puts you at risk of disruptions caused by data breaches. As more devices and transport control systems depend on online connectivity, vulnerabilities will inevitably arise, increasing the potential for sensitive data to wind up in unscrupulous hands.\nWith new threats constantly emerging, you must do your due diligence to identify risks and shut down attacks before they affect operations. Steps that you can take to manage cybersecurity threats include:\nAt TÜV SÜD, our cybersecurity specialists provide advisory, assessment, training, audit, and certification services specifically designed for the transportation industry. Our solutions cover all aspects of IT security in the transportation sector, from rail cybersecurity and IT penetration testing to TS 50701 and IEC 62443 (railway) certification projects.\nOvercoming external and internal cybersecurity issues and threats to critical IT infrastructure requires expertise and experience. Powered by over 150 years of safety and security experience, TÜV SÜD delivers unbiased advice and trusted in-house safety and security workshops for transportation firms.\nAs a leader in helping organisations worldwide navigate through their digital transformation journey, TÜV SÜD is acutely aware of the cybersecurity challenges that come with digitalisation. We are here to work alongside your team to conduct comprehensive security tests and stay on top of new regulatory requirements in the transportation industry.\nWork with a trusted name in cybersecurity to ensure the resilience of your transportation networks and keep your customers’ data safe. Our team of 25,000 multidisciplinary experts from more than 1,000 locations around the world is here for you.\nAligning systems with security-by-design principles\nRailway companies must follow risk management procedures and conduct continuous auditing according to industry-specific guidance. Adhering to security-by-design principles ensures that the networks and technologies supporting your infrastructure are designed and built securely.\nMeeting KRITIS requirements for IT security\nIn Germany, KRITIS providers, such as water, food, electricity, and transport, are required under the IT Security Act 2.0 to demonstrate that they are enforcing cybersecurity measures to protect their systems. The constant threats you face require you to maintain the highest safety and security standards.\nSecuring products and systems data operational risks\nYour firm has a wide range of datasets flowing between physical and digital systems, allowing cybercriminals to hide in the heavy traffic to attack and control informational and operational data. Your IT infrastructure must have the appropriate security measures and defences in place to manage these risks.\nDetecting and responding to security incidents\nApart from compromised data, cybercrime can have a debilitating impact on railway companies due to disruptions like for example: 1. Interruption of traffic lights, electronic signals, toll booths, and railway signal systems 2. Disruption of ticketing machines and fare gates 3. Blocked access to backend systems and data\nPenalties and fines for non-compliance\nKRITIS organisations that fail to comply with industry regulations face fines of up to €20 million or up to 4% of their annual turnover, whichever is higher. Failure to comply with KRITIS regulations may also lead to imprisonment and the prosecution of responsible executives, managers, and personnel.\nEnsuring the availability and resilience of operational systems\nCyberattacks on transport networks can have lingering effects that last weeks, if not months. Attacks that can paralyse transportation systems and networks include: DDoS attacks, DNS attacks, credential stuffing, brute force attacks, DNS spoofing, malware, data manipulation and content theft, and phishing.\nA compact overview of the functional safety regulation landscape\nLearn more about the safety challenges for autonomous machinery\nLearn about current trends and challenges and get an overview about opportunities offered by functional safety.']"	['<urn:uuid:1b6b6b73-f34f-4522-9bdb-cd23fc9936a3>', '<urn:uuid:83c51e42-7251-472e-8c9a-d89ae9db46e6>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	21	97	1347

Kakadu has been home to Aboriginal people for more than 50,000 years, and many of the park’s extensive rock art sites date back thousands of years. Kakadu’s rock art provides a window into human civilization in the days before the last ice age. Detailed paintings reveal insights into hunting and gathering practices, social structure and ritual ceremonies of Indigenous societies from the Pleistocene Epoch until the present.\nThe largest national park in Australia and one of the largest in the world’s tropics, Kakadu preserves the greatest variety of ecosystems on the Australian continent including extensive areas of savanna woodlands, open forest, floodplains, mangroves, tidal mudflats, coastal areas and monsoon forests. The park also has a huge diversity of flora and is one of the least impacted areas of the northern part of the Australian continent. Its spectacular scenery includes landscapes of arresting beauty, with escarpments up to 330 meters high extending in a jagged and unbroken line for hundreds of kilometers.\nThe hunting-and-gathering tradition demonstrated in the art and archaeological record is a living anthropological tradition that continues today, which is rare for hunting-and-gathering societies worldwide. Australian and global comparisons indicate that the large number and diversity of features of anthropological, art and archaeological sites (many of which include all three site types), and the quality of preservation, is exceptional.\nMany of the art and archaeological sites of the park are thousands of years old, showing a continuous temporal span of the hunting and gathering tradition from the Pleistocene Era until the present. While these sites exhibit great diversity, both in space and through time, the overwhelming picture is also one of a continuous cultural development.\nKakadu National Park doesn’t get as much attention as other sites in Australia, but it is arguably the best. Kakadu is home not only to more wildlife than you will find almost anywhere else in Australia but is also the home to some of the oldest rock paintings on the continent.\nKakadu is a 2-3 hour drive from Darwin in the Northern Territory. In addition to saltwater crocodiles and kangaroos, you can see stunning waterfalls and enormous termite mounds.\nMuch of what you experience will be determined by the time of year you visit. I visited at the beginning of the dry season, which was a great time to view crocs on the river, but not so great for going to the waterfalls (the roads were closed).\nMany of the outback scenes from the movie Crocodile Dundee were shot in Kakadu National Park.\nKakadu National Park is a national park and protected area in Darwin, Northern Territory in Australia. The park specifically sits within the Alligator Rivers region with a total land area of nearly 20,000 square kilometers. The park is equivalent the size of Slovenia or nearly half of Switzerland! The park was established in 1979 and was inscribed into the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1981. In 1987 and 1992, there were extensions to the area in Kakadu National Park that is covered by the heritage area.\nThe park is the largest terrestrial national park in the country and also contains the most productive uranium mines in the world – Ranger Uranium Mine.\nAbout Kakadu National Park\nKakadu National Park is a land of extraordinary landscape and rich diversity when it comes to ecology and biology. It also transforms according to every season; hence, this makes it possible for a wide variety of plants and animal species to thrive.\nThe geology of Kakadu is all about the ancient landscape. The heritage area consists of some of the oldest exposed rocks there is with most of them dating back to 2,500 million years ago. About 140 million years ago, Kakadu is part of a shallow sea. As time went on, the sea drained and the former sea cliffs are now transformed into dramatic escarpment walls. If you explore the land at the Kakadu National Park, you will discover various landscape features that were formed out of various geological activities over the years. These landscape formations include vast floodplains, cross bedding, ripple marks, igneous intrusions, conglomerates, and unconformity.\nAs mentioned above, the park is also known for its biological diversity. There are six main landforms within the park and each one is home to different species of plants and animals. According to researchers, there are more than 2,000 plant species in the park and many of them had been used by early Aboriginal settlers for medicinal and weaving purposes. Meanwhile, the diverse ecosystem also enables mammals, birds, reptiles, fish and amphibians to thrive in this environment. Many endangered, endemic or rare species are living in the Kakadu National Park.\nKakadu National Park is more than just a park showcasing the natural beauty of the Northern Territory in Australia. It is also of cultural importance to the land where it is located. Before the national park was established, it is a living cultural landscape. The original settlers on the land were the Bininj Mungguy. They settled in the area where Kakadu National Park is for more than 50,000 years. Hence, they have established a deep spiritual connection to the land and are integral parts to the history of Kakadu.\nThe Kakadu National Park in Australia is a wild place. Hence, it is important to be aware of your surroundings when exploring and follow these safety guidelines:\n- Drink lots of water when you are hiking. Pack at least four liters of water for a day tour.\n- Wear sturdy but comfortable shoes.\n- Always use sun protection. In a barren landscape, there is little place to find shade.\n- On your visit to Kakadu National Park, always listen to instructions from the park rangers and your guide. Do not go off exploring on your own.\n- If you are bringing your own children, make sure to supervise them at all times.\n- When exploring, always stay on marked tracks. There are also designated visitor areas that you should stay in.\n- Obey all warning signs. They were placed there for a reason.\n- There is no mobile phone coverage on most parts of the park. If you plan to leave for to tour the national park, make sure to let someone know.\n- Prepare for the heat. Use protective gear such as sunglasses and hats/caps. The hottest time of day in the park is between 2:30 PM to 6:30 PM with temperature reaching 30 degree Celsius or more.\n- Saltwater crocodiles are common in bodies of water. Beware when exploring via boat.\nView the complete list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Australia.\nView the list of all of the UNESCO World Heritage sites I have visited on my travels.']	['<urn:uuid:690108a2-dc07-4ce0-bac1-a0c662e850d4>', '<urn:uuid:52c368ea-7bad-4c61-abd0-4ca49b192512>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	10	54	2186
95	compare laser capabilities spreos dircm versus mini music dircm missile protection systems	SPREOS DIRCM and mini-Music DIRCM have different laser capabilities for missile protection. SPREOS combines a dual-band countermeasure laser with radar-based confirmation and tracking, causing incoming missiles to miss the aircraft. The mini-Music system, on the other hand, uses a powerful fiber laser for efficient operation along with a thermal camera for accurate acquisition and tracking. Both systems are designed to protect against IR-guided missiles, with SPREOS specifically focused on MANPADS threats.	['This is the first time BIRD Aerosystems’ presented its SPREOS DIRCM System in the USA\nBIRD Aerosystems, the leading developer of Airborne Missile Protection Systems (AMPS), presented its RF Confirmation and Jamming Sensors Family at the Quad-A Aircraft Survivability Equipment Symposium in Huntsville, Alabama.\nBIRD’s RF (radio frequency) Confirmation and Jamming Sensors Family include the MACS sensor, which performs confirmation of suspected incoming missile threats and ensures a zero False Alarm Rate with maximum aircraft protection, and the SPREOS DIRCM, which combines a radar-based confirmation sensor and an active laser jammer, and provides enhanced protection against the immediate threat of Man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS).\nRonen Factor, Co-Chief Executive Officer and Founder: “BIRD’s clients are operating in the most dangerous theaters, where the need to avoid false alarms in order not to be detected is essential. BIRD’s MACS has the capability to accurately differentiate between a false alarm and a missile in a very short time frame, thus reducing the false alarm rate to practically zero. BIRD’s new SPREOS DIRCM combines a laser jammer on the MACS, thus creating a single unit that is able to eliminate the false alarm while also jamming the missile. Altogether, these products offer the optimal aircraft protection. We were excited to once again participate at the Quad-A Aircraft Survivability Equipment Symposium, and to present our cutting-edge RF Confirmation and Jamming Sensors Family in the USA”.\nThe patented Missile Approach Confirmation Sensor (MACS) sensor performs unique confirmation of suspected incoming missile threats detected by the main electro-optical passive sensors, and practically eliminates any False Alarms. Upon receiving a pre-alarm warning from the electro-optical sensors, MACS slews to the direction of the incoming threat and verifies the threat’s validity. Concurrently, MACS also collects relevant information on the target (velocity and distance) and calculates its time-to-impact, enabling the most effective countermeasure response to the incoming missile. This validation process between the electro-optical sensors and the MACS provides the most effective filtering for all nature and man-made known types of false alarms that are usually detected by electro-optical sensors. MACS ensures that only real missiles will be declared by the system and reacted upon.\nBIRD’s Self Protection Radar Electro-Optic System (SPREOS) combines a radar-based sensor (verification) and an active laser (DIRCM), and provides enhanced protection against the immediate threat of Man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS). SPREOS integrates into a single Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) multiple functions, including threat confirmation, tracking and jamming of advanced IR guided missiles. Upon receiving a warning from the onboard Missile Warning System (MWS), SPREOS quickly slews to the direction of the incoming threat and activates the dual-band radar function for confirmation and high precision tracking. Following the confirmation and tracking SPREOS deploys the dual-band countermeasure laser causing the missile to miss the aircraft.

96	prevent cross contamination washdown equipment	Cross contamination can occur through food-to-food, equipment-to-food, and people-to-food contact. In washdown environments, equipment must be designed to minimize areas where bacteria can build up. This includes using one-piece bonded bearings instead of open-ended bearings with grooves, avoiding multiple component assemblies, and ensuring proper drainage. Additionally, equipment surfaces should be properly cleaned and sanitized, and good hygiene practices must be followed. Stainless steel is preferred in food contact areas due to its corrosion resistance and cleanability.	"['Linear Motion in Washdown: Select the right components for food-processing equipment\nA washdown environment is one that utilizes, either by hand or by automatic means, cleaning with water, chemicals or a mixture of these. This washdown process can be as simple as a cloth and bucket or use of a hose to spray clean — or it can be under sophisticated high-pressure, controlled systems. The goal of these washdown operations is to eliminate bacteria and other microorganisms that can cause and spread disease. In recent years, examples of incidents such as e-coli breakouts and mad cow disease have rightfully led to greater scrutiny on processing equipment that may contain areas where unwanted bacteria can develop.\nOne key to successful linear motion design for a washdown environment is the choice of the materials used for the bearing, shaft or rail, and seal components. To achieve the requirements needed for corrosion resistance, proper standard and regulation compliance, and machine performance requires the right selection of materials.\nStainless steel is typically the preferred material for general use in direct food contact areas because of its corrosion resistance and durability. However, there are variations in stainless steel grades mostly in the levels of chromium and nickel.\n• 300 Series: the most widely accepted material for food grade and medical applications. It is relatively soft, cannot be hardened and is also non-magnetic. Each of the grades (303, 304 and 316) can have different types that have slightly different formulations with varying strengths and weakness based on the addition to the mixtures.\n• 400 Series: the most widely available and most used in industry is the 440, which can be heat treated and hardened. It is often used for cutlery, linear shafting and in applications requiring good wear resistance. It can be hardened up to approximately RC58; however, due to added carbon in its makeup, 440 will oxidize under washdown conditions.\nStainless steels do not rust with a red colored oxide on the surface the way that “rust” is normally observed. If these types of particles appear on a stainless surface, it is most likely due to iron particulate that has contaminated that surface or is coming from fillers within the bearing. To cleanse that surface, a solution of 10-per-cent nitric acid and two-per-cent hydrofluoric acid at room temperature can be effective.\nAluminum can be used in some areas of a washdown environment where weight is a concern. However, be aware that bare aluminum will have poor corrosion resistance and is susceptible to pitting and cracking. In washdown conditions, aluminum MUST be coated for protection. Often anodizing, ceramic coating, or other types of coatings with PTFE or other fillers are used, but may not provide the resistance or life that stainless steel offers. In more caustic chemical washdown environments, stainless steel is the preferred material.\nElectroless nickel coatings have become increasingly popular because of their corrosion and wear resistance combined with a smooth polished appearance. Some forms include a PTFE infusion to aid in non- sticking properties. Most forms of this coating are FDA compliant as well.\nNon-metal materials like plastics, polymers and fillers tend not to have the corrosion resistance and durability of metal surfaces over time and are thus not used as often as major components in food and pharmaceutical equipment. However, due to cost, weight, manufacturability, etc., they are increasingly being used “under the hood”, inside of mechanical drive components, guides, bearings, fasteners and more. Many solid plastics, such as injection molded bearing inserts, can present drawbacks in washdown applications in that most will absorb liquid, causing the component to swell and increasing the potential for binding and failure.\nAlso, be aware that each of the standards organizations covered earlier has extensive information on a variety of plastic materials that are acceptable.\nLinear motion components offer their own unique challenges when being designed for washdown applications. Rotating components need to be mounted and sealed within a limited area, but because the moving component of a bearing, slide or actuator system travels in a linear fashion, the space needing to be sealed or cleaned will be far greater; often up to several feet. Below are some tips on how to minimize areas of potential bacteria buildup and maximize cleanability.\nThere are two basic types to be aware of when considering plain bearings. When using plastic inserts, be aware of moisture absorption that will lead to the bearing material swelling. This can result in binding issues. If the inside diameter is increased to deal with the swelling, it can often cause loose tolerances and inaccuracies in the system.\nIt is best to avoid open-ended bearings with grooves or inserts in areas that may be susceptible to bacteria buildup. These two-piece type bearings will allow the microscopic bacteria to seat in the crevices, grooves, and to hide between the outer shell of the bearing and the plastic bearing insert. One- piece bonded bearings eliminate this potential for bacteria collection.\nThe same principle is true for recirculating ball bearing type products, such as roundway linear ball bearings and profile rails. They provide advantages, such as low friction and tight tolerances, and are often available in stainless steel materials with FDA compliant lubrication. However, they can present disadvantages in that they require grease lubrication to be used due to the metal-to-metal contact. This lubrication picks up material from the food items being processed and can then become trapped inside of the multiple crevices and cavities around the balls and in the raceways of the bearing. This can potentially be a breeding ground for unwanted bacteria.\nThe best solution for most applications is to utilize a one-piece bonded bearing. The bearing materials, are PTFE based, self-lubricating and require no external lubrication that can collect potentially contaminated material. In addition, there are no grooves, crevices, or space between liner and bearing shell where residue can become lodged allowing bacteria to grow. The bearing material and outer shell are bonded together creating a true one-piece bearing.\nIn vertical applications such as those found on in-line and carousel bottle filling machines, it is advisable to utilize a bearing that is sealed at the top end. This eliminates contamination and the majority of fluid in the filling and washdown process from penetrating the bearing ID. Yet it allows the liquids that do get into the bearing system to easily flow through and exit at the bottom of the assembly.\nAnother area of potential concern in this type of configuration is that the many multiple component sub-assemblies utilizing a parallel shaft design can experience bearing binding problems due to misalignment. In addition, these multiple components are also susceptible to bacteria buildup around the connectors and joints. Newer technology that incorporates dual rail load capacities and functionality into a single rail design can eliminate potential areas of contamination collection.\nIt is best to avoid as much component assembly as possible in a washdown environment. Traditional methods for linear assemblies utilize a shaft and support rail bolted together, which are then bolted to a mounting plate or carriage. Each of these connection points creates a joint, crack, or crevice and a potential location where liquids can penetrate or where bacteria can begin to cling and buildup over time.\nNew technology in linear motion has created slide assemblies that eliminate the need for traditional multiple components and connectors. Unique two-piece slide systems are an ideal solution for washdown environments. In addition, these new style linear motion components are designed with smoothly curved edges that do not have recesses where buildup can occur.\nWhen possible, avoid mounting connectors from the washdown side. They protrude and create another area where contamination can collect. It is best to bring the connector up through the bottom of the rail to be mounted. If necessary and connectors enter the washdown area, use a domed nut for easier cleaning.\nParticularly in food grade applications, it is important to consider the location where the linear motion device is to be mounted in relation to the food being processed. When components that are not compliant or that do not meet other regulations for food contact, are used over the open food path or in a position where it could potentially come into contact with the food items being processed, risk can be eliminated by installing a stainless steel shield or cover over the components.\nWhen constructing shields and other covers, it is important to give consideration as to how the panels and plates are to be connected or welded together. Small collection points for moisture and the potential for corrosion and bacteria buildup are the result of leaving the irregular surface of a weld exposed to the splash area. Whenever possible, the best-case scenario is to radius all corners.\nAnother tactic used to help in the management of moisture and fluids around linear motion components is to add weep holes, drainage channels, slots, or other porting features designed to channel the moisture away from potential pooling areas.\nThis is an edited article based on the PBC Linear whitepaper, “Linear Motion Design for Washdown Applications.” For more information, visit www.pbclinear.com.', 'Presentation on theme: ""Sanitation In an Industrial Kitchen Student Need-to-know Information.""— Presentation transcript:\nSanitation In an Industrial Kitchen Student Need-to-know Information\nRole of the Public Health Inspector They are employed by your local health unit to: inspect food premises examine records close a food premise investigate complaints educate people other public health matters\nPremises awaiting First FoodCheck Peel Inspection Premises in substantial Compliance with the Food Premises Regulation Minor non-compliance Reinspection at next Scheduled inspection Disclosure Signs\nSignificant non-compliance With the Food Premises Regulation Threat to food safety with reinspection within 72 hours Immediate health hazard observed in the premises.

97	gettysburg address length words details how many minutes deliver	The Gettysburg Address was remarkably brief at approximately 270-272 words and took Lincoln just two to three minutes to deliver with interruptions for applause. Lincoln worked on the speech for two weeks, writing the final version on two pages: a piece of White House stationary and a plain blue sheet. Despite its brevity, it became one of the most famous speeches in U.S. history, with the Springfield Republican newspaper praising it as 'a perfect gem; deep in feeling, complete in thought and expression.'	"['Last summer I spent a day on the battlefields at Gettysburg, Pa. From July 1-3, 1863, almost 50,000 men died here. The relatively short battle turned the Civil War; Gen. Robert E. Lee’s Confederate army would never again invade the North.\nWalking along the Union battery line at Cemetery Ridge, I thought about why Gettysburg happened. It’s an echo of the gospel: Great sacrifice is required to right a great wrong.\nI walked a few hundred yards north from Cemetery Ridge. On Nov. 19, 4 ½ months after the battle, President Abraham Lincoln came here to dedicate Soldiers’ National Cemetery. The event’s main speaker was U.S. Sen. Edward Everett, who blathered two hours and 13,607 words in a speech no one ever quotes.\nThen the president stepped forward. He began: “Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, on this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.”\nOver the next two minutes, and in just 272 words, Lincoln delivered “the most eloquent articulation of the democratic vision ever written.” Great sacrifice was required to right a great wrong and restore a great vision.\nEverett wrote to Lincoln the next day: “I should be glad, if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the central idea of the occasion, in two hours, as you did in two minutes.”\nHistorians have called the Gettysburg Address “deliberately biblical.”\nJesus told some of the most memorable stories in the history of humanity in fewer words than Lincoln would use for the Gettysburg Address. For consistency, I’ll use NIV for these examples.\n- The parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:30-35) takes just 163 words.\n- The lost sheep (Luke 15:4-7): 100 words\n- The lost coin (Luke 15:8-10): 74 words\n- The Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32): a whopping 508 words. That’s verbose by comparison, but at 11-point Times New Roman, it still fits nicely on one page.\n- The Lord’s Prayer (Matthew 6:9-13): 57 words!\nLuke might have been the best journalist among the biblical writers. He not only quoted Jesus, he also followed his example. The story of Mary and Martha and their contrasting responses to Jesus visiting Martha’s home (Luke 10:38-42) took 121 words. The story of the Transfiguration – the moment when Jesus’ true glory is revealed at last (Luke 9:28-36): 212 words.\nIf there’s a secret to brevity, revered newspaper writing coach Donald Murray nailed it: Selection, not compression. Read Luke’s gospel and note the details he didn’t include. We have no idea what Mary or Martha looked like, what Martha’s house looked like or what they were having for dinner. We don’t even get the name of their “certain village.” All irrelevant. Instead, Luke selects the detail that Mary sat at Jesus’ feet while Martha prepared the dinner. He quotes Martha directly: “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!”\nAnyone who’s ever hosted a party can relate. And then Luke gives us Jesus’ response: “Martha, Martha,” the Lord answered, “you are worried and upset about many things, but few things are needed—or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.”\nLuke chose the precise details that best delivered the story’s meaning. The rest, interesting as they might have been, didn’t make the final cut. That’s a profound lesson in good writing.\nContrary to popular myth, Lincoln didn’t write the Gettysburg Address on the back of an envelope during the train ride to Pennsylvania. He worked two weeks on it, with the final version written on two pages: a piece of White House stationary and a plain blue sheet.\nLincoln knew his Bible. It’s not hard to imagine him drawing on the gospel stories’ brevity as examples. He also knew his audience: 15,000 people who had been standing for hours in the November cold. Presidential or not, a short speech would be better.\nWriting short is harder than writing long. Every word, every comma and especially every period matters. Of Lincoln’s address, the Springfield (Mass.) Republican newspaper wrote: “His little speech is a perfect gem; deep in feeling, complete in thought and expression, and tasteful and elegant in every word and comma.”\nToday’s writers tend to think we have to invent a new art of writing ridiculously short, for a newly distracted audience. Hardly. The art has been there all along, just waiting to be rediscovered.\nDeliberately biblical, you might say.', 'Tue November 19, 2013\nShort Speech Still Resonates: The Gettysburg Address Turns 150\nOriginally published on Tue November 19, 2013 3:54 pm\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:\nThis is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I\'m Robert Siegel.\nMELISSA BLOCK, HOST:\nAnd I\'m Melissa Block. A few appropriate remarks. That was the invitation extended to President Lincoln. Would he formally consecrate the National Cemetery at Gettysburg with a few appropriate remarks? Lincoln\'s speech, delivered 150 years ago, the Gettysburg Address, is, of course, now considered among the most famous in U.S. history.\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\nBLOCK: It\'s a speech of remarkable brevity, about 270 words. It took Lincoln just two, maybe three minutes to deliver with interruptions for applause.\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.\nBLOCK: Gettysburg was the bloodiest battle of the Civil War, more than 50,000 dead and wounded. When Lincoln spoke, it was more than four months after that battle. Bodies of Union soldiers that had been hastily buried in makeshift field graves were being reinterred in the new cemetery and carcasses of dead horses were still strewn all over the battlefield.\nHAROLD HOLZER: It is almost inconceivable to think of what that area was like over the miles square that this battle took place in.\nBLOCK: That\'s Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer.\nHOLZER: There were hundreds of dead animals, probably thousands of dead horses and then add to all of that the heat of the Pennsylvania summer, really made the town almost unbearable and people walked around with scented handkerchiefs over their noses for months.\nAnd the odor apparently lingered into the winter, long past the day this ceremony took place.\nBLOCK: On November 19, 1863, President Lincoln rose before the crowd, 10 maybe 20,000 people. They converged on the small town of Gettysburg for the event. And Harold Holzer explains, in those brief remarks, Lincoln called on the nation to fulfill the pledge of equality spelled out in the Declaration of Independence, that cause for which the Gettysburg dead gave the last full measure of devotion.\nHOLZER: It is almost to take a subject, any subject, and I would think any writer, with all due respect to great writers, and do something so declarative and so emotional and so transformative in the space of time that he took in just a few sentences, as you say, of 270 or so words, dedicated to consecration and rebirth at the same time, using Gettysburg as the springboard for a new birth of freedom throughout the whole country, never mentioning specific subjects unrelated to the consecration, but clearly implying that the time had come for America to continue, as he said, its unfinished work and embrace African Americans as part of the promise of the new birth of freedom. It\'s extraordinary.\nBLOCK: When you say embrace the cause or embrace African Americans, that\'s implicit in the text, but certainly not explicit.\nHOLZER: That\'s sort of the remarkable thing about it and probably why it has stirred conversation on every anniversary now for the sesquicentennial especially, is that it almost rose above specific issues and controversies and attempted to steer everyone, no matter what their political view, toward the idea that the country had changed and that it would emerge from the Post-Gettysburg, Post-Civil War era as a totally different country.\nBLOCK: There\'s that famous note of humility embedded in this speech when Lincoln says the world will little note nor long remember what we say here.\nHOLZER: Well, he was a modest person, but I don\'t believe he thought it for a minute. So it\'s the biggest mistake he ever made in the speech.\nBLOCK: There are a number of myths surrounding the Gettysburg Address that have sprung up over the years. What are a couple of them?\nHOLZER: One of the myths is that he regarded it as a flat failure. He allegedly turned to his friend Ward Lamon, who was the master of ceremonies at the event, and said, the speech won\'t scour. It\'s a flat failure. I should\'ve done more work on it. I don\'t think he was received disrespectfully at all and it wouldn\'t have happened. And if there was silence as some allege at the end of the speech, it was probably because people were either dazzled or surprised that it was so brief.\nThe other myth is that it was ridiculed and attacked universally as inappropriate after it was delivered. And I think if you carefully look at the newspapers of the day, you find out that public opinion broke in an entirely and predictably partisan way, that is Republican newspapers cheered the address and praised it to the skies and Democratic newspapers, fearful, I think, that it was an opening salvo on a presidential reelection campaign attacked it and attacked Lincoln.\nSo I think the myth of the failure is the biggest myth of all. There are lots of little disagreements. Was Lincoln audible or not audible? Was it warm or was it cold? Did Lincoln arrive on a gallant horse or did he ride on an animal that was so short that his legs were dragging along the ground? You can go on and on and on and on. But...\nBLOCK: Did he ride in on the back of an envelope?\nHOLZER: Oh, I forgot. That\'s, of course, I had even discarded that because it\'s such an old story. The truth is, Lincoln prepared it very carefully, as carefully as he had — was able to prepare anything during his presidency, including his annual messages which were the equivalent of State of the Union messages today.\nHe worked whenever he could for a couple of weeks on it and as a Rhode Island newspaper acknowledged afterwards it\'s harder to write a short speech than it is a long speech in many ways because of the compression of emotion and ideas that brevity requires.\nBLOCK: When you think about the Gettysburg Address 150 years after it was delivered, what to you seems the most timely part of what Lincoln had to say on that day?\nHOLZER: I think the most timely section, the most relevant for today, is the concept of unfinished work. America\'s work is always unfinished, I suppose. There are goals that we yearn (technical) to achieve and that others really resist achieving. Twas ever thus. President Obama paraphrased that famous line when he went to the 50th anniversary of the ""I Have A Dream"" speech at the Lincoln Memorial, appropriately enough this summer.\nAnd he talked about America\'s unfinished business and completing America\'s unfinished business. There is a concept that we adopted centuries ago of a perfect union or at least a more perfect union, which indicates that there\'s always work to be done and we still walk that walk and march that march in quest of the more perfect union.\nI think Lincoln was looking at the fact that America\'s founders had created a government and now we were testing whether the government could survive an internal challenge.\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.\nHOLZER: That\'s the part that continues to challenge us, a notion that there\'s always work to be done to achieve the more perfect union.\nBLOCK: Harold Holzer, thanks so much for talking to us.\nHOLZER: Thank you.

98	How do lizards adapt to predators, and how do fish adapt to darkness?	Brown anoles show rapid adaptation to predators by evolving from long legs for outrunning to shorter legs for hiding in crevices and climbing trees within a single generation when faced with curly-tailed lizard threats. Meanwhile, blind cavefish adapt to darkness through vibration attraction behavior (VAB) - swimming toward oscillating objects - which provides a 47% increase in foraging efficiency, facilitated by superficial neuromast sensors in their eye orbit.	['Most of us think that evolution in species take several generations to thousands of years to occur. However, how about if I say in one generation’s time there is a significant change in morphology? Jonathan Losos and his team of researchers from Washington University, St. Louis has found a peculiar lizard that is evolving in a tremendous rate. The brown anole, a Caribbean native lizard, spends most of its day hunting on the ground. One of its main predators is the curly-tailed lizard.\nAs we all know from our evolution class, a chain of islands sets up a great opportunity for parent species to change significantly. Since the Bahamas are home to the brown anole, natural selection will most likely to occur if there is a change in predator population. Losos has tested his hypothesis that with the introduction of more curly-tailed lizards into the main island, the brown anoles are under the influence of selection pressure change (Losos, et. al, 2006). When brown anoles sense danger of increasing populations of curly-tailed lizards, it flees towards trees and stay away from the ground activities for a few generations.\nAfter a year’s experiment, Losos discovered that the brown anoles are experiencing a change in leg morphology. In the first six months of his study, the anoles originally had long legs, which enable them to outrun the predators. However, six months later, the survivors had drastically shorter legs, which permit them to hide in narrow crevices and climb in trees. Losos noticed that within a single generation, the anoles went to quick reversals in selection pressure (Losos, et. al). The behavior of the lizards changed, as they prefer treetops than the ground. Here we see natural selection at its finest.\nOver several generations down, the continuing threat of curly-tailed lizards will force the anoles population to evolve shorter and shorter legs. However, I find it hard to believe that brown anoles can evolve in one generation at such a fast pace. Perhaps through time the longer legged anoles died off and Losos found mostly shorter legged since it was able to survive and reproduce.\nThe quick reversal of evolution by means of selection pressure is quite interesting. The brown anoles started with long legs to outrun its predators but discovered it to be a hindrance as it cannot bend its legs to hide in crevices. It preferred to have shorter legs to save energy and it is easier to live in trees away from the main predator. The anoles do not have a use of long legs anymore so it does not have to evolve back. For example, ostriches, emus, and kiwis all are flightless birds yet they have small wings. Their ancestors were flying species, but, through time, with fewer predators to run away from, they probably foraged on the ground more. Over generations, they most likely could adapt better on land and did not need developed wings for flight. That is why they evolved long, strong legs for running and scratching for food. I believe this is similar to what is occurring to the brown anoles. Their ancestors must have evolved longer legs to run away from predators. however, current species reverted to shorter legs when selection pressure changed. Although I believe the leg lengths did change because of pressure, I find it hard to believe this had all occurred in one generation.\nJ. B. Losos, T. W. Schoener, R. B. Langerhans, D. A. Spiller (2006). Rapid Temporal Reversal in Predator-Driven Natural Selection Science, 314 (5802), 1111-1111 DOI: 10.1126/science.1133584', 'Evolution of an adaptive behavior and its sensory receptors promotes eye regression in blind cavefish: response to Borowsky (2013)\n© Yoshizawa et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. 2013\nReceived: 11 June 2013\nAccepted: 28 June 2013\nPublished: 11 July 2013\nVibration attraction behavior (VAB) is the swimming of fish toward an oscillating object, a behavior that is likely adaptive because it increases foraging efficiency in darkness. VAB is seen in a small proportion of Astyanax surface-dwelling populations (surface fish) but is pronounced in cave-dwelling populations (cavefish). In a recent study, we identified two quantitative trait loci for VAB on Astyanax linkage groups 2 and 17. We also demonstrated that a small population of superficial neuromast sensors located within the eye orbit (EO SN) facilitate VAB, and two quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified for EO SN that were congruent with those for VAB. Finally, we showed that both VAB and EO SN are negatively correlated with eye size, and that two (of several) QTL for eye size overlap VAB and EO SN QTLs. From these results, we concluded that the adaptive evolution of VAB and EO SN has contributed to the indirect loss of eyes in cavefish, either as a result of pleiotropy or tight physical linkage of the mutations underlying these traits. In a subsequent commentary, Borowsky argues that there is poor experimental support for our conclusions. Specifically, Borowsky states that: (1) linkage groups (LGs) 2 and 17 harbor QTL for many traits and, therefore, no evidence exists for an exclusive interaction among the overlapping VAB, EO SN and eye size QTL; (2) some of the QTL we identified are too broad (>20 cM) to support the hypothesis of correlated evolution due to pleiotropy or hitchhiking; and (3) VAB is unnecessary to explain the indirect evolution of eye-loss since the negative polarity of numerous eye QTL is consistent with direct selection against eyes. Borowsky further argues that (4) it is difficult to envision an evolutionary scenario whereby VAB and EO SN drive eye loss, since the eyes must first be reduced in order to increase the number of EO SN and, therefore, VAB. In this response, we explain why the evidence of one trait influencing eye reduction is stronger for VAB than other traits, and provide further support for a scenario whereby elaboration of VAB in surface fish may precede complete eye-loss.\nKeywordsAnimal behavior Regressive evolution Constructive evolution Neuromast Tradeoff Pleiotropy Quantitative trait locus Eye QTL cluster Adaptation\nBorowsky’s first two points involve the interpretation of specific experimental results, specifically the evidence for an relationship among vibration attraction behavior (VAB), neuromast sensors located within the eye orbit (EO SN) and eye size based on the overlap of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for these traits. Borowsky highlights several additional QTL on linkage groups (LGs) 2 and 17 that could also interact with eye size, including those for traits that are putatively adaptive (condition factor, maxillary teeth), maladaptive (maxillary teeth, weight loss, depth of caudal peduncle), and neutral (melanophore number, suborbital bone width, thoracic rib number). “Thus,” Borowsky writes, “there are numerous potential interactions in this region; none of which is individually strongly supported on the sole basis of the proximity of QTL.”\nContrary to Borowsky’s contention, we did not argue for the existence of an ‘exclusive’ relationship among VAB, EO SN and eye size, only the existence of a ‘direct’ relationship between VAB and EO SN and (possibly) an ‘indirect’ one among these and eye size. We based these conclusions on several lines of evidence. First, we concluded that VAB and EO SN are directly related based on experimental evidence that EO SN ablation reduces VAB . Second, we concluded that both may be indirectly related to eye size given (1) the position of the EO SN within the eye orbit, (2) the correlation of both VAB and EO SN with eye size among the members of our genetic cross (r = −0.26 and −0.44, respectively, both P <0.001), and (3) the significant clustering of all four QTL for VAB and EO SN with two of the five QTL for eye size in just two regions of the Astyanax genome, a pattern that is unexpected by chance assuming a Poisson distribution of QTL locations (χ 2 = 98.2, df = 3, P = 3.8 × 10-21). Although we feel that these results offer strong evidence for our conclusions, their strength and significance may be best understood in comparison to the other QTL that Borowsky has highlighted.\nFirst, we concede that other traits within this region are also genetically correlated with eye size. Several putatively adaptive traits exhibit strong genetic correlations with eye size (condition factor, weight loss and chemical sensing ability; r = −0.24, 0.17, and −0.32, respectively; all P <0.01), although many putatively neutral and maladaptive traits do not (suborbital bone width, depth of caudal peduncle, melanophore number and maxillary teeth) . But in either case, these observations constitute neither evidence for nor against the existence of a direct relationship between VAB and EO SN or an indirect one among VAB, EO SN and eye size.\nSecond, our argument did not rely solely on the existence of overlapping QTL, but also on QTL clustering in a manner that was unlikely to be observed by chance. Importantly, when the overlap among Borowsky’s other putatively adaptive QTL is measured in the same manner, the observed overlap of condition factor, weight loss and maxillary teeth with the eye size QTL is not significantly different than expected by chance (χ 2 = 2.0, df = 2, P = 0.359). The clustering of these additional traits does reach statistical significance if considered in terms of the multi-trait model used by Protas et al.  (χ 2 = 13.1, df = 4, P = 0.0001); however, this model is different from the QTL strategy that we implemented and it implicitly assumes that traits are correlated as a result of pleiotropy or tight linkage  - the same conclusion we draw in our study. We acknowledge that the large distance between peaks for the eye and VAB QTL on LG2 may not provide the most convincing evidence for pleiotropy or hitchhiking under the assumption that the responsible mutations reside under the peak of each QTL; however, we only assume that they fall somewhere within the QTL’s 95% confidence limits.\nFinally, of all the putatively adaptive traits that Borowsky implies could just as easily explain the correlated evolution of traits on LGs 2 and 17, there is only genetic or experimental evidence of adaptation for two: eye size and VAB [1, 2]. We estimated that VAB provides a 47% increase in foraging efficiency under laboratory conditions . Assuming that this advantage provides an estimate of the selection coefficient for VAB , so long as the selection coefficient of VAB and/or eye size remains substantially larger than the selection coefficients of nearby alleles that determine putatively neutral or even maladaptive traits, then these linked QTL can still be carried to fixation as a result of genetic hitchhiking [7, 8].\nBorowsky’s final two points concern the assumption that indirect selection is necessary to explain the evolution of eye loss among cavefish. Given the numerous tradeoffs between eyes and non-visual sensory systems that have been documented among cave organisms [9–11], we made this assumption explicit at the outset of our study. But, based on the consistent polarity of numerous eye QTL, Borowsky argues that no such assumption is necessary since the most parsimonious explanation for this observation is direct selection against eyes. Borowsky further argues that eye size must first be reduced in order to promote EO SN expansion and, therefore, VAB. Whether or not direct or indirect selection (or both) is ultimately responsible for cavefish eye-loss is beyond the scope of this reply, but we can address the validity of this assumption and our proposed evolutionary scenario.\nWe agree that the consistent polarity of cavefish eye QTL constitutes strong genetic evidence for selection against eyes. And although direct selection against eyes may be the simplest explanation for this observation, it is not necessarily the only one. In his paper describing the sign test used to infer the role of selection based on the polarity of QTL, Orr noted that, “rejection of the null hypothesis does not, strictly speaking, allow us to conclude that the analyzed character was the direct target of selection. One can never completely exclude the possibility that the measured character changed as a correlated response to selection (although this seems less plausible for the larger, and sometimes dramatic, character differences often considered in QTL analyses)” . Thus, indirect selection against eyes is not ruled out on the basis of QTL polarity.\nAs for the plausibility that VAB promotes eye loss before eyes have been completely reduced, we wish to highlight three important points. First, we note that some lab-reared and fully-eyed Astyanax surface fish exhibit a weak form of VAB [5, 13], suggesting that this trait may be present at low frequencies in natural populations. Second, competition assays between these VAB-positive and VAB-negative surface fish confirm that VAB-positive surface fish out-compete VAB-negative ones and that this advantage disappears under lighted conditions, supporting the foraging advantage of VAB in darkness even among surface fish ; furthermore, VAB was abolished when VAB-positive surface fish were treated with lateral line inhibitors, suggesting that surface fish VAB also function through the lateral line system [5, 13]. Third, we also found that the number of EO SN is negatively correlated with eye size among eyed F2 and F3 progeny. These three observations suggest that VAB and EO SN number can increase foraging efficiency even among Astyanax eyed populations . Since surface fish with VAB lack EO SN but nonetheless respond weakly to a broad range of vibrations between 5 and 35 Hz , the enhanced EO SN and 35 Hz VAB tuning found among cavefish might have evolved following some initial reduction in eye size among VAB-positive surface fish populations that invaded caves .\nWe acknowledge that other factors can and do promote eye loss in Astyanax. In Yoshizawa et al. , we demonstrate that the proposed VAB-EO SN pathway is independent of the pleiotropic SHH-pathway that has already been shown to influence cavefish eye degeneration . Here, we also note that there are cavefish populations that exhibit eye reduction without exhibiting VAB, especially those found in the Molino and Tinaja caves . But these observations do not contradict the conclusions of our study. It is well established that eye-loss has evolved more than once among different Astyanax cavefish populations [15–20], and several lines of evidence suggest that different mutations are responsible for eye-loss among these groups [17, 21]. We did not propose that all cases of eye-loss in Astyanax are the result of VAB or even that VAB is directly responsible for eye reduction. Rather, we proposed that VAB may have promoted eye-loss due to direct selection on nearby loci for VAB. If the nearby eye QTL are not under direct selection (as Borowsky suggests may be the case for the QTL on LG 17), then eye-loss could have evolved indirectly via pleiotropy or hitchhiking, perhaps following some initial reduction in eye size due to direct selection at several other eye QTL. Alternatively, if both VAB and the nearby eye QTL are under direct selection, then eye reduction and VAB could have evolved together due to the combined fitness of their alleles. Unfortunately, our current results cannot distinguish between these two evolutionary scenarios. In the end, we agree with Borowsky that “the hypothesis may or may not be true, but we will not know until the genes are identified and characterized.” And, thanks to the active development of new genomic resources for Astyanax, the answer may come sooner rather than later.\nQuantitative trait locus\nSuborbital bone 3\nVibration attraction behavior.\n- Yoshizawa M, Yamamoto Y, O’Quin KE, Jeffery WR: Evolution of an adaptive behavior and its sensory receptors promotes eye regression in blind cavefish.

99	looking for oldest living tree world where is methuselah located how old	Methuselah, a bristlecone pine located in the White Mountains, is the oldest known, verified living tree in the world at 4,853 years old.	"['White Mountains (California)\n|Peak||White Mountain Peak|\n|Elevation||14,252 ft (4,344 m)|\n|Length||60 mi (97 km)|\n|Width||10 mi (16 km)|\nThe White Mountains along the east side of Owens Valley\n|States||California and Nevada|\n|Parent range||Basin and Range Province|\n|Borders on||Inyo Mountains and Sierra Nevada|\nThe White Mountains of California and Nevada are a triangular fault-block mountain range facing the Sierra Nevada across the upper Owens Valley. They extend for approximately 60 mi (97 km) as a greatly elevated plateau about 20 mi (32 km) wide on the south, narrowing to a point at the north, with elevations generally increasing south to north. The range\'s broad southern end is near the community of Big Pine, where Westgard Pass and Deep Springs Valley separate it from the Inyo Mountains. The narrow northern end is at Montgomery Pass, where U.S. Route 6 crosses. The Fish Lake Valley lies east of the range; the southeast part of the mountains are separated from the Silver Peak Range by block faulting across the Furnace Creek Fault Zone, forming a feeder valley to Fish Lake Valley. The range lies within the eastern section of the Inyo National Forest.\nEcologically, the White Mountains are like the other ranges in the Basin and Range Province; they are dry, but the upper slopes from 9,200 to 11,500 ft (2,800 to 3,500 m) hold open subalpine forests of Great Basin bristlecone pine on permeable dolomite and certain granite substrates and limber pine on less permeable rocky substrates. Middle slopes from 6,500 to 8,200 ft (2,000 to 2,500 m) have somewhat denser stands of piñon pine and Utah juniper. These upper and lower conifer zones are often separated by a zone of mountain mahogany brush. Various subspecies of sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) extend from surrounding valleys to the lower alpine zone.\nA bristlecone pine, named Methuselah, located within the mountain range is the oldest known, verified living tree in the world, at 4,853 years old. Pine nuts from piñon pine stands were harvested as a winter staple food by Paiute Indians whose descendants still live in adjacent valleys.\nThe White Mountains also have small remnant groves of lodgepole pine, Jeffrey pine, ponderosa pine, Sierra juniper and aspen including an unusual dwarf variety. These species are common in the nearby and wetter Sierra Nevada range west of the Owens Valley and must have been more widespread in the White Mountains until Holocene droughts extirpated them in most of this drier range. A number of plant species are endemic to the White Mountains, including the White Mountains horkelia, Horkelia hispidula.\nFauna include two herds of bighorn sheep, mule deer, marmots and feral horses. Permanent streams have no native fish, but there are naturalized populations of trout including rare Paiute cutthroat trout which is protected from angling. Birds include Clark\'s nutcracker and other Corvidae which eat and cache pine nuts.\nCattle from ranches in surrounding valleys are still grazed under permit as high as the alpine zone. Historically sheep were also grazed in large numbers, introducing diseases from which the native Bighorn Sheep populations are still slowly recovering. Before European colonization of surrounding valleys in the mid 19th century, Paiute Indians occupied summer hunting camps up to about 13,100 ft (4,000 m), leaving ruins of archeological interest.\nThe highest point in the range is White Mountain Peak, which at 14,252 ft (4,344 m) is the third-highest summit in California. This peak is actually an extinct volcano rising about 1,600 ft (490 m) above the plateau surface. The summit is composed of Mesozoic metavolcanic rock – lava lifted and melted by rising granite. The volcano itself is long since gone. The White Mountains are the highest range completely inside the Great Basin, although the adjacent Sierra Nevada Range along the basin\'s western edge has two higher summits. The entire range is within the Inyo National Forest.\nA four-wheel drive road reaches the summit of White Mountain Peak from the south to service the summit laboratory of the White Mountain Research Center. The road is normally gated seven miles from the summit at an elevation of 11,680 ft (3,560 m), making this California\'s easiest 14,000 ft (4,300 m) summit.\nNorth of White Mountain Peak, two sharp arêtes alternate along the crest with the broad ""whalebacks"" plateau of Pellisier Flats with about six more summits over 13,000 ft (4,000 m). Pellisier Flats is a wide sloping bench at the 13000 foot level with rocky fields and short alpine vegetation. The bench includes Mt. Hogue at 12,743 ft. and further north Mt. Dubois at 13,559 ft., the high point on the plateau. Pellisier Flats is the broad spine of the White Mountains.\nThe crest crosses the California–Nevada state line just south of a final high summit Boundary Peak 13,147 ft (4,007 m), Nevada\'s high point. Boundary Peak is the ""prow"" of the triangular fault block. It has views directly down into valleys to the west, north and east that are hidden by the increasing width of the high plateau to the south. North of Boundary Peak the range rapidly loses altitude and ends at Montgomery Pass.\nThe west face of the White Mountains rises steeply out of Owens Valley. Climbing to any summit from this direction is a scramble with about 8,000 ft (2,400 m) elevation gain. Eastern slopes are somewhat gentler and have numerous cirques left by Pleistocene glaciers and even a few snowfields persisting through most summers. Most of these cirques are entered or approached by jeep roads and offer scenic yet non-technical routes to the crest.\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.

100	I'm starting a garden which needs dormancy delphinium amaryllis need dormancy period	Amaryllis and delphinium have different dormancy requirements. Amaryllis bulbs need 4-6 weeks of dormancy in a dark place before reblooming, which is typically done by stopping watering and placing them in a dark closet or basement. In contrast, delphinium seeds actually require a cold stratification period (exposure to cold temperatures) for better germination - they need to be placed in a refrigerator or cold balcony for 3-4 days where temperatures can drop to 23°F before being returned to room temperature for sprouting.	"['Sorry for the long delay between posts. We’ve had major technical difficulties with our blogs and they’ve all been down for several days.\nNow back to gardening…\nIf you were a very good and diligent gardener and saved your amaryllis bulbs from last Christmas, now is the time to bring them inside and make them go dormant in time for another round of holiday blooms.\n(photo from Netherlands Flower Bulb Information Center)\nAmaryllis bulbs need a good four to six weeks of dormancy before they’ll come into flower again. Stop watering them now and put them in a dark closet or basement for six weeks and forget about them. Just let the foliage die back on its own.\nThe key to getting them to rebloom from year to year is to treat them just like any other houseplant for the rest of the year. After the big flowers fade (just after the Christmas holidays if your timing is good), cut off the stalks but leave the green foliage to keep growing.\nIn late May, I put mine outdoors for the summer in an inconspicuous corner of the garden and ignore them till late September or early October. Definitely bring them in before the first frost.\nHere’s a pot of three amaryllis bulbs that I bought last December and set outdoors in May.\nAnd another that was in a really ugly plastic pot that I threw out. You can just stick the bare bulbs into the garden for the summer and then dig them up now and cut back the roots.\nAfter six weeks in the dark, dump out an inch or so of topsoil around the bulb and replace with compost or good-quality potting soil. Then start watering again and wait six or eight weeks for your bulb to begin anew.\nWant to know more about amaryllis? Here are excerpts from an article for the paper that I did last December:\n“Each winter brings a new crowd of amaryllis admirers who have discovered how incredibly easy it is to grow these showy, almost gaudy bulbs. Just stick the bare bulb in a shallow pot with a little potting soil, add water and sunlight and you’re ready to go.\nIn six to 10 weeks, you’re rewarded with a blast of richly colored blooms atop long, sturdy stems. Red remains the traditional favorite, especially for Christmas and Valentine’s Day, but new varieties in shades of white, salmon and pink arrive from growers every fall. Bicolored shades of red and white have been big sellers in recent winters.\nAmaryllis bulb production has more than doubled worldwide since the late 1990s, according to the Netherlands Flower Bulb Information Center. Most of the new production has been in South America, the bulb’s native continent.\nThat means many more amaryllis bulbs for North American households, especially early in the season.\nBrazil now has nearly 500 acres devoted to commercial amaryllis production, up from almost none in the late 1990s. Many of the new growers are immigrants from Holland, which had been the worldwide leader for many years.\nCommercial growers in Holland still use nearly 150 acres for amaryllis, down from a peak of about 250 acres. Two other production centers, Israel and South Africa, have remained steady at about 62 acres.\nMany varieties these days are doubles – when one flower-covered stem begins to fade, another rises up to take its place and add several more weeks of bloom time.\nUnlike other bulbs such as tulips, daffodils and hyacinths, amaryllis bulbs don’t need a cooling-down period of several weeks to set their blooms. Like paperwhites, they’re ready to begin growing as soon as they come home from the garden center or arrive\nAmaryllis (known botanically as Hippeastrum) like to be potbound, so set the bulbs snugly into a shallow pot with a drainage hole. Use just enough potting soil so that the top third of the bulb sits above the soil. Give them bright light and a good drink of water to start, then water sparingly until green shoots begin to appear. (The soil should be dry to the touch about 1/2 -inch down from the surface.)\nAfter they begin to grow, water regularly to keep the soil moist but never soggy.\nWhen in full flower, move the plants out of direct sunlight to make the flowers last as long as possible. The cooler the room, the better.\nBecause amaryllis have all the food they need inside the bulb, you can also forgo soil completely and just set them into pebbles or stones. Add just enough water to keep the roots wet.\nAmaryllis bulbs can live for decades, and it’s easy to maintain them from year to year.\nBrent and Becky’s Bulbs 877-661-2852 www.brentandbeckysbulbs.com\nDutch Gardens 866-866-3780 www.dutchgardens.com\nJohn Scheepers Inc. 860-567-0838 www.johnscheepers.com\nNetherlands Flower Bulb Information Center 802-293-2852 www.bulb.com\nVan Bourgondien 800-622-9997 www.dutchbulbs.com\nWhite Flower Farm 800-503-9624 www.whiteflowerfarm.com.', ""It is believed that the unopened delphinium flower looks like a dolphin's head, but there is an opinion that the delphinium flowers received its name in honor of the Greek city of Delphi, in the vicinity of which they grew in a great amount. Anyway, all florists will agree that this luxurious flower will decorate any flower garden.\nFeatures of delphinium flower\nGrowing of delphinium is not an easy task, it requires knowledge and work. Firstly, the planting site must be in full sun in the morning and protected from a strong wind, also water should not stagnate, otherwise delphinium will just rot. After planting mulching with peat or humus is mandatory. On one site delphiniums grow no more than 5-6 years, and Pacific species are less durable and can grow on one site no more than 3-4 years, then the bushes should be divided and planted out. Delphiniums should be staked several times during a season for their hollow stems not to get broken by wind. In addition, the delphinium is susceptible to powdery mildew and some pest species. But if you care for delphinium properly, it will reward you with a vigorous prolonged flowering in June and one more flowering in August or September that will be shorter but no less beautiful.\nSpecies of delphinium\nThere are annual and perennial delphiniums. The most popular varieties of annual delphiniums are field larkspur and the delphinium ajacis.\nFiled delphinium (Delphinium Consolida)\nis 6.6 ft high. Flowers of the inflorescences are simple or double, pink, white, lilac or blue. It has been cultivated since 1572. Frosted Sky varieties (blue flowers with white center), pale pink Rose and dark blue Dark Blue look very impressive. Field delphinium blooms in early summer until autumn.\nis a hybrid of doubtful larkspur and East delphinium and it has the best of their qualities as a result of breeding. The stem of this species is from 1.3 to 3.3 ft in height, almost sessile leaves are strongly dissected, spicate inflorescences reaching 11.8 inches in length have a variety of flower colors: violet, red, blue, pink, blue and white. The flowers of some varieties are fully double. There are dwarf varieties such as Dwarf Hyacinth, up to 11.8 inches high with double flowers of purple, pink, crimson and white colors. Delphinium ajacis blooms from June till the frosts.\nCultivation of the perennial delphiniums began in the 19th century: on the basis of the first perennials delphinium elatum (Alpine delphinium) and delphinium grandiflorum (Siberian larkspure) the first hybrids were obtained, and then the French flower breeder Victor Lemoine created the double forms of perennials of purple, blue and lavender colors named delphinium ornatum or hybrid delphinium (delphinium hybridum), and then renamed into delphinium cultorum. Today there are up to 800 flower colors of perennial delphiniums! Among them there are tall, medium-height and low-growing varieties with simple, semi-double, double and fully-double flowers ranging in size from 0.8 to 3.5 inches in diameter.\nHybrid perennials are divided into groups according to the place of origin. The most popular are Scottish (hybrids F1), New Zealand delphiniums (New Millennium Delphiniums, or New Zealand Hybrids) and Marfin hybrids, named after the state farm “Marfino”. Each group has its own features and advantages. Marfin hybrids, for example, have excellent frost resistance and are very ornamental, they have large semi-double flowers with a bright contrast spot ( “Blue Lace”, “Morpheus”, “Spring Snow”, “Pink Sunset”). But it is very difficult to grow a Marfin perennial delphinium from seeds since the seeds do not preserve varietal characteristics.\nBeing recently created, the New Zealand groupis distinguished by its high growth (up to 7.2 ft), large semi-double or double flowers (2.7-3.5 inches in diameter), and some species have wavy petals. These hybrids are frost-resistant, insusceptible to diseases, durable, perfect cut flowers, and that's why they are the most popular today. Cultivation of New Zealand delphiniums is a rewarding and profitable business, if you earn money by selling flowers. Popular varieties are Sunny Skies, Green Twist, Pagan Purples, Blue Lace, Sweethearts.\nThe creator of the Scottish hybrid perennial delphiniums is Tony Coakley. These hybrids are distinguished by very fully double and double inflorescences, sometimes having up to 58 petals. If the plant reaches 3.6-5 ft in height, the inflorescence can be 2.6 ft in length! Scottish hybrids have a wide flower color palette. They are minimal care plants, long-flowering and perfectly retain their varietal properties during seed reproduction. The most famous varieties are the Morning Sunrise, Blueberry Pie, Moon Light, Sweet Sensation, Crystal Delight and Deepest Pink.\nGrowing of delphinium from seeds\nSowing of delphinium\nGrowing of perennial delphinium from seeds is not only a profitable but also fascinating business if compared with the purchase of planting material. Delphinium is propagated by seeds, the rhizome division, by buds and cuttings, but in this section we will tell you how to grow delphinium from seeds. Sowing of delphinium is carried out at the end of February. Remember that when storing seeds in a dry warm place, the germination capacity is lost. Fresh seeds must be sown immediately or kept in the refrigerator until the right time.\nPrepare the soil for the seeds: take peat, garden soil and humus (compost) in an equal amount, add a half part of the washed sand, sift the mixture. To increase the moisture capacity and looseness of the soil, add perlite at a rate of half a glass to 1 gallon of soil mixture. Now heat the mixture on a water bath for an hour to destroy the seeds of weeds and spores of mushrooms. Fill the seed starter pots with a mixture and lightly compact it.\nPlanting of delphinium: scatter the seeds over the soil surface, immediately fixing the labels with the name of the variety and the date of sowing. Sprinkle the seeds with the 0.11 inch layer of soil mixture so that the seeds are not washed away when first watered, and slightly compact the topsoil layer. Gently pour or sprinkle the surface with cold boiled water. Cover the container with a transparent lid, and then with black foil or cover material, as the delphinium seeds grow better in the dark, and place the container on the windowsill near the glass. The best temperature for seed germination is 50-59 °F. To increase the germination, in 3-4 days place the container in the refrigerator or on the glassed balcony and do not be afraid if the night temperature drops to 23 °F. In two weeks, place the container with the seeds on the windowsill. After this procedure (stratification) the shoots should appear in a week or two, and try not to miss this moment as you should immediately remove the foil. You should prevent the soil from getting dried out, spray it from time to time and air the container to get rid of the condensate.\nSeedlings of delphinium\nHealthy sprouts are dark green, strong, their cotyledons are pointed. When the plants have 2-3 leaves, you can prickle the plants in 7-11 fl oz pots, and then grow them at a temperature of no higher than 68°F. Soil must be loose, light. Watering should be very moderate to avoid a “blackleg” disease that will lead to the death of seedlings. Since the beginning of May, gradually accustom the seedlings to fresh air, without removing them from the windowsill during airing. Keep it in the bright sun for a while. Before planting in the soil, feed the delphinium seedlings with combined fertilizers 1-2 times with a 2 week break. The fertilizers should not get on the leaves. Adult seedlings can be planted in the open ground, when the lump of soil in the pot is fully filled with roots – the seedlings are easily removed with the lump without damaging the root system.\nPlanting of delphinium\nThe seedlings of delphinium are planted out in the open ground when the threat of night frost passes. As already mentioned, the planting site should be sunny in the morning and without stagnation of moisture. The planting holes are dug at a distance of 2-2.3 ft from each other, the diameter of holes should be 1.3 ft and the depth is 1.6 ft, pour half a bucket of humus (compost), two tablespoons of a combined fertilizer and a glass of ash into each hole, mix it with the soil so that fertilizers do not got on the root of the plant, then make a deepening, put a seedling into it, compact the soil around it and water it. For the first time it is better to cover each seedling with a plastic bottle or a glass jar until the plants take root properly, but once the delphiniums start growing, the cover needs to be removed.\nCare for delphinium\nWhen the shoots are 4-6 inches long, they are fed with a solution of cow dung at the rate of 1 bucket of manure per 10 buckets of water for 5 large shrubs. After weeding and loosening of the soil, the flower beds should be mulched with a 1.2 inch layer of humus or peat. When the stems are 7.8-11.8 inches high, the bush should be thinned: keep 3-5 stems on a bush to get large and beautiful inflorescences. Remove the weak shoots of the inner part of the bush, breaking or cutting them off at the base. This will protect the plant from diseases and allow air to circulate. If the cuttings are not hollow and cut with a heel (part of the rootstock), they can be rooted. The cut is treated with a mixture of charcoal and crushed pills of heteroauxin, the cuttings are planted in a mixture of sand and peat and covered with a foil. In 3-6 weeks the cutting starts taking roots, and two weeks later it is planted in the open ground. This is the answer to the question of how to grow delphinium vegetatively by cuttings.\nDuring the growing season, each delphinium drinks up to 13 gallons of water. How to grow delphinium in the heat? You need to pour 2-3 buckets of water for each bush weekly. When the soil dries after watering, you need to loosen it to a depth of 1.2-2 inches. Delphiniums need watering especially during the formation of inflorescences, and if there is a heat during this period, then the inflorescence will get “gaps of the truss”, that is, the areas without flowers. To avoid this delphinium needs heavy watering and top-dressing with potash phosphorus fertilizers at the rate of 0.7 oz of fertilizer per bucket of water, 35 fl oz of solution for each bush.\nAfter flowering the inflorescences are cut off, seeds are harvested, but new shoots appear and in autumn delphiniums bloom once more. At the end of summer or early autumn, between the first and second flowering, you can divide three-four-year-old shrubs of delphinium. The bush needs to be dug out, neatly divided or cut with a knife so as not to damage the buds of renewal, the places of cuts are sprinkled with wood ash and the separated parts are planted out. This is another way of vegetative reproduction of delphinium.\nDelphinium after flowering\nWhen the leaves wither after flowering, the stems of delphinium are cut at a height of 11.8-15.7 inches from the ground and for safety reasons the top of the tube (the hollow stem) is covered with clay. This should be done so that autumn rains and melt water do not get through the cavity to the root neck and do not lead to the death of the plant from decay of the rhizome. Almost all delphiniums are frost-hardy, both adult plants and seedlings. If winter is cold and snowless, beds with delphiniums should be covered with fir twigs or straw. The plants can be seriously damaged only by frequent and sharp temperature drops, because they lead to an excess of moisture that can make the rhizomes rot. The best way to avoid this is to add half a bucket of sand into the planting hole, so that excess moisture can go deep through it.\nYou might think that dealing with this plant, especially growing of delphinium from seeds, is too troublesome, but if care for it properly and spend a little time and effort, the results will exceed all your expectations.\nReferences and links\n- Read also about topic at Wikipedia\n- Features and other plants of the family Ranunculaceae\n- List of all species on The Plant List\n- More information at World Flora Online""]"	['<urn:uuid:75973369-32d8-4f9f-b976-99c199512e86>', '<urn:uuid:654ce4b8-c3c1-4493-b03b-a21d5080c841>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T04:17:31.021795	12	82	2899
