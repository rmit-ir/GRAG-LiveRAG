1	compare greek heroes kleos versus samurai bushido code warrior values honor	Both Kleos and Bushido were warrior codes that emphasized honor and fame, but they had distinct characteristics. In Ancient Greece, Kleos focused on achieving everlasting fame through battlefield glory, with warriors seeking to be remembered in songs and stories after death. Physical rewards (kudos) like gold, tripods, and other treasures were concrete manifestations of this glory. For Samurai, Bushido emphasized loyalty to one's master, self-control, and fearlessness in the face of death. While both valued honor more than life itself, Samurai were expected to commit ritual suicide (seppuku) if they failed to live up to their code, whereas Greek heroes sought to win glory through battlefield achievements and accumulation of prizes. Both systems were deeply connected to religious beliefs - Greek heroes sought immortality through fame, while Samurai drew strength from Zen Buddhism's teachings on discipline and conquering the fear of death.	"['“Death in ten thousand shapes hangs ever over our heads, and no man can elude him; therefore, let us go forward and either win glory for ourselves, or yield it to another.”\n– Sarpedon, Iliad, 12.310-28\nWe’re back to classical concepts this week, with another cast favourite. This week is all about glory, or Kleos as the Ancient Greeks called it. It’s a fascinating concept that really helps us to understand the world of the Iliad and Odyssey (and of the Batrachomyomachia)!\nWhat is Kleos?\nΚλέος (kleos) is often translated in English as “Glory” or “Renown”, but it’s roots are in κλύω (klúō) which is “I hear” in Ancient Greek, so in reality, Kleos means something more like “that which is heard”. No, this isn’t the original gossip girl; your Kleos is your everlasting fame and it is the ultimate drive for any Ancient Greek hero.\nAncient Greek Kleos…\nWhy is it important?\nThe desire for Kleos defined Greek society in so many ways. There is a school of thought that since life was short and hard, and death was ever present in the Ancient World, everyone had a very acute sense of their own mortality. The cure for mortality was in your Kleos. If you could do something that gained you fame and renown, people would write songs and stories about you and through those you would become, in a way, immortal. The best way to gain Kleos was by being a famous warrior. Nowhere is this more encapsulated than in the fate of Achilles.\nAchilles is perhaps the only mortal ever given the choice of two fates – Thetis, his sea nymph mother, tells him that if he avoids the Trojan War, he will live to a ripe old age with a large family who will love and honour him, but after a few generations his name will be lost to the winds of time. However, by fighting before the gates of Troy, he will live a short and bloody life, become the aristos archaeon – the best warrior in the world – and die as a young man heaped with Kleos. It is a testament to Kleos’ allure that Achilles chooses the latter. But, after-all, we are still talking about him today, so maybe he made the right choice?\nElsewhere, the Iliad is incredibly self-aware of the power of Kleos; when the characters talk about their own mortality, it is with the knowing irony that they will live on forever in the poem. Helen tells Hector that\n“Zeus gives us an evil fate, so we may be subjects for men’s songs in generations yet to come.” (Iliad VI. 442).\nOther characters, like the Lycian king Sarpedon, openly admit that their prominent position in society comes from their willingness to stand in the front line of battle:\n“Why in Lycia do we receive especial honour as regards our place at table? Why are the choicest portions served us and our cups kept brimming, and why do men look up to us as though we were gods? … one may say to another, our princes in Lycia eat the fat of the land and drink best of wine, but they are fine fellows; they fight well and are ever at the front in battle.” (Iliad IX. 320).\nKleos is so important to the Ancient Greek heroes that they were quite literally ready to die for it.\nThe Euphronios Krater showing the (spoiler alert) death of Sarpedon\nSo how do you get it?\nStuff was really important in Ancient Greece – actual physical stuff like tripods and sheep, gold cups and cloaks of the finest Tyrian purple. The heroes of the Iliad and Odyssey care about getting stuff so much that they take frankly ridiculous risks, even to the point of risking certain death just to gain more. Odysseus allows the Cyclops to eat 6 of his men just for the possibility of getting some presents, and Achilles begs the King of the Gods, Zeus, to make the Greeks lose the war – his own people – just because they took some of his precious stuff away from him! It all makes very little sense to a modern audience and many an undergraduate classicist has spent the first few years of their degree not really understanding why the greatest hero of the Greek world was a giant crybaby who kicks off about losing some stuff and causes a LOT of other people to die. But armed with a better understanding of Kleos, we now know that all this stuff is actually kudos and those heroes cared about that stuff so much because it represented their Kleos.\nSome examples of Kudos\nYou’ve probably heard of kudos, right? As in “hey I heard you got that amazing new job – kudos!”. Well kudos is an Ancient Greek word too, and it is completely tied up with Kleos. Your kudoswas the physical manifestation of your Kleos– that is your worth and fame were literally measured in how much stuff you had (#earlyconsumerism).\nSo how do you get stuff in the Ancient World? Well battle is the best place. War can be incredibly lucrative if you’re attacking a rich settlement, and Troy was particularly rich. As it was placed in a fruitful position for trading with both the East and West, the city is described as “rich in horses” which are a traditional symbol of wealth and power and having “a shining diadem of towers”. Arguably, the Greeks attacking Troy had nothing to do with Helen and a lot more to do with the riches to be won – this is basically the plot of the 2004 blockbuster adaptation Troy.\nThe prizes from war were allotted to the heroes at the end of each day of fighting in accordance with how well they had fought. But there were other ways. For example, you could win sports competitions like the ones held during the funeral for Patroclus in Book 23 of the Iliad. The prizes for this included a slave woman (skilled in all the useful arts), talents of gold, horses and tripods worth an incredible 12 oxen (we’ve told you about this legit currency before!). At funerals the dead’s possessions would be distributed among his friends (check out this great story about Ajax killing himself because he didn’t get Achilles’ armour after he died), and gifts were also a traditional part of Xenia, which we wrote a whole blog post about that you can check out here!\nSo without writing a dissertation, I think we’ve just about covered Kleos. If you want to find out more, then we’d recommend reading literally any part of the Iliad, or if you are more of a film buff the movie Troy does actually do a decent job of showing how important glory was to the Ancient Greek warrior-heroes. If you have any burning questions or comments, feel free to tweet us with them, or really any other form of social media…we’re on Instagram here and Facebook here!', 'Rise of the Military Society\nWhen Minamoto Yorimoto came to power to Japan in 1192, instead of taking place as emperor, he took place as shogun and set up a military government with a capital of Kamakura, which started a new era that marked a beginning in Japan history. Samurai, professional warriors, became Japan\'s ruling class.\nThe military government was led by a shogun, who ruled with help of warrior-lords called daimyos. Which in turn, they were supported with large numbers of samurai. The samurai pledged to protect the shogun and in the 14th century Japan resembled the lord-vassal system of Europe. Because of the samurai\'s loyalty to their leaders, they were rewarded with appointments to office and grants of land.\nThe samurai were expected to be honest, brave, and intensely loyal to his lord. The word samurai means ""those who serve."" For the samurai\'s it was more important to die an honorable death than to live a long life. The samurai were fearless fighters and devote Buddhists, which helped them prepare to face death and their duties.\nSamurai Armor, Weapons and Fighting\nThe samurai went into battle dressed in heavy armor, since it was needed for them to be protected. The first thing on was a robe called a kimono and baggy trousers, and to protect their legs they wore leather or cloth shin guards. But, the actual armor itself was unique and different, lined with small metal plates coated with lacquer and was laced with silk cords. To protect their chest and back, they wore boxlike panels of armor. The samurai\'s would wear metal sleeves to protect their arms and broad shoulder guards and panels that hung over his hips to provide extra protection. To look fierce to their opponents, they wore a mask that was mean looking, yet still protected his face. Last but not least was the helmet, which they burned incense in it before putting it on.\nMilitary Training and Fighting Skills\nLearning the skills of the samurai to extensive training. They had to learn archery, fencing and/or sword fighting. The samurai\'s were apprenticed by archery masters that taught the mental and physical techniques. They also learned how to breathe and shoot properly by riding on a galloping horse. In s wording Fighting they learned how to make their opponent make the first move, how to stay out of range of their enemy\'s sword, and how to fight fight against their enemy in tight spaces or against more than one opponent. When they would either lose or break their swords in battle, they learned how to fight using other object such as a metal fan or wooden staffs. Another option was martial arts.\nThe samurai had a unique style in battle.\n1. Messages from opposing sides met to decide the time and place if combat?\n2. The two armies faced each other a few hundred yards apart.\n3. The samurai shouted their names , ancestors, heroic deeds, and reason for fighting.\n4. Then the armies charged with samurai firing arrows as they urged forward.\n5. After battle they would clean and mount their Oppenheimer heads and show to the warlord that they really killed their foes.\nSamurai Training and the Warrior Code\nMetal and Physical Training:\nThe samurai\'s education of war also included mental training. This was key to their training, especially since they had to learn self control to overcome their emotions, Like the fear of death. To learn how to handle pain, they went days without eating, walked barefoot in the snow, and had stiff posture for over long periods of time. The samurai were trained to develop a ""sixth sense"" about danger and came from tough training.\nThe code of Bushido:\nThe samurai code developed over servearl centuries, and in the 17th century it took for as Bushido, "" Way of the Warrior."" This governed the samurai\'s life. It required the samurai to be honest, fair, and fearless in the face of death. They valued loyalty and honor even more than their life. Their job was to be loyal to his master, and if his lord died he would avenge his death.\nIf one did not live up to Bushido, the price of pay was ritual suicidqe, or seppuku. The would also do this if they did a shameful deed, committed a crime, or insulted a person of higher rank. When seppuku was performed guests were invited. To prepare they would take a bath, unbide their hair, and put on white clothes, and was served his favorite foods. When finished eating he took a sword and plunged into his stomach trying to make a circle. To put him out of his agony, a swordsman would quickly cut off his head.\nMost samurai studied Buddhism, the two popular forms were Amida and Zen. The samurai were drawn to this, and especially zen.\nIn the 12th century a monk named Honen founded Amida Buddhism. They believed that all people could reach paradise. They taught that believers could reach paradise by relying on Amida Buddhism. Amida was an Indian Prince and when he became Buddha he set up a paradise named Pure Land. To enter, one must prayerfully repeat Amida\'s name over and over again. When the believer died he would go to the Pure Land.\nZen was another form of Buddhism, the samurai liked it because of its emphasis on effort and discipline. To achieve enlightenment and self-reliance, you meditated. Zen Buddhists would meditate for hours to reach enlightenment. To become enlightened it required giving logical thinking everyday. Zen masters used puzzling questions called koans. They also created zen gardens to aid their meditation . It symbolized nature, like rocks on the sand could represent islands in the ocean. Zen helped samurai learn discipline, focus on their minds, and conquer the fear of death.']"	['<urn:uuid:5f8417e3-9232-4a62-9355-cb4960b842fe>', '<urn:uuid:b18f8611-e1ef-43f0-b0df-79179fead026>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	11	142	2140
2	My grandmother lives in a remote village with limited access to doctors - I've heard about some new ways to get medical care remotely. What options are available nowadays?	Telemedicine is a solution that can connect patients, clinics and hospitals in remote areas to centres of excellence. Through telemedicine, X-rays, ECGs, ultrasound images, and pathology slides can be transmitted to specialist centers for opinion. Video conferencing allows patients and doctors to engage live with specialists for diagnoses and advice. This technology can improve health outcomes through early diagnosis, provide access to specialist care, and reduce hospital stays by enabling home monitoring. However, it may have limitations such as cost, availability, and the lack of personal touch that some patients find important.	"[""Is Technology the Future of Healthcare Sector?\nYou're reading Entrepreneur India, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media.\nIn prehistoric and ancient times magic and religion played a large role in the origin and the cure of disease. Diseases were thought to be of supernatural origins such as a spell cast by an enemy, possession by a demon or a god who had been offended. The methods to treat such diseases varied. They included potions, counterspells, incantations, suction and trephining. So “doctors” then were either witch doctors or sorcerers.\nMedicine and healthcare have come a long way since the ancient times. Some of the greatest discoveries in medicine have happened in the last one hundred years. The practice of medicine has become evidence-based as opposed to individual based. There are guidelines and protocols for almost every disease and problem in medicine. Medical or health technology has progressed rapidly thus enabling doctors to widen the boundaries of the scope and practice of medicine.\nSo what is Health Technology?\nWHO defines health technology as the application of organised knowledge and skills in the form of devices, medicines, vaccines, procedures and systems developed to solve a health problem and improve quality of lives. It also recognises that “health technologies equips health-care providers with tools that are indispensable for effective and efficient prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation and attainment of internationally agreed health-related development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration”.\nSo what are the examples of Health Technology as applied to day to day medicine?\nThis could for example range from something as simple as a medical examination to preventive immunisation, contraceptives, imaging procedures such as ultrasonography, MRI, angiogram, angioplasty and laparoscopic surgery, to more complex procedures such as joint replacement, organ transplantation, life-sustaining technologies for critically or terminally ill patients and more recently, genetic testing, genetic therapy, and stem cell research.\nThe other devices that have changed the way medicine is practised include electronic health records as opposed to paper records, use of smartphones, tablets and applications, telemonitoring and video conferencing, GPS trackers for disabled and sufferers of Alzheimer's.\nIndia is a country of diversities - diverse geographies and terrains and populations, stark socio-economic divides and crippling inequality in access to health care.\nUnder these circumstances what are the health technologies that could be useful for the vast majority of Indians that cannot afford healthcare nor access them?\nTelemedicine is one such modality that can connect patients, clinics and hospitals in remote areas (who may not have access to specialist care) to centres of excellence. For example, X-rays, ECGs, ultrasound images, pathology slides etc can be transmitted to these centres, which can then give an opinion. Video conferencing is another important way in which patients and doctors can engage live with a specialist centre to seek live diagnoses and advice. There are examples of doctors in remote areas being guided successfully through surgeries since the time taken to transfer the patient to a specialist centre would have further worsened the condition of the patient.\nOn another dimension, telecommunication has helped set up digital libraries that provide easy online access to medical journals and books thus putting medical knowledge just a “click” away. This is in direct contrast to a non-digital era when print was the only method of accessing data and knowledge.\nThe advantage of telemedicine, especially for a country like India where health care in some areas is either non-existent or accessed with difficulty, is enormous. It has the potential to improve health outcomes by an early diagnosis, allow access to specialist care, reduce the manpower needed to run healthcare (it well known that the doctor-patient ratio in India is less than 1 per thousand population) and reduce the cost of hospital stays by monitoring patients at home. The disadvantages include cost and availability. Smaller hospitals and clinics may not be able to afford this facility. It takes away the personal touch from the consultation which a lot of patients find vital to their healing process. Telemedicine cannot diagnose all conditions via video conferencing and may require a face to face consultation.\nThese are exciting times in the field of medicine with an abundance of technology and innovative procedures available to doctors and hospitals. And because of the several choices available in the market, an easy mistake to make is to invest in costly technology without adequate forethought on its usefulness in the long term. In order to prevent this the WHO mandates that there should be rigorous policies in place. This is known as health technology assessment (HTA).\nHealth technology has in many ways revolutionised the way in which medicine is practised. It has made accessible what was once inaccessible to large sections of the world. However like all other fields in technology also, the pros and cons should be carefully considered before embracing it wholeheartedly. It should also be remembered that the art of medicine lies in treating the patient as a whole. Ancient physicians exemplified this by treating both the body and the soul. And despite all the advances in medicine, it must never be forgotten that medicine is both a science and an art. A science which brings the very latest to mankind and an art that still considers the patient as a body and a soul.""]"	['<urn:uuid:87767b80-7df3-4380-9ddc-8789ce84e81d>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	29	92	880

It’s well-made. And it’s fun to watch.\nAnd, according to Time magazine, it’s one of the greatest films ever made.\nBut is Pixar’s 2003 animated confection about a dotty chick fish who helps a nervous Nelly of a papa fish look for his beloved son one of the 100 greatest films of all time?\nShould it be part of the canon?\nShould children be taught to enjoy its aesthetic and moral splendor just as they are supposed to adore the works of Chaucer, Shakespeare, and T.S. Eliot? (Visions of college lit courses on “The Royal Son: Hamlet & Nemo and the Dialectics of Being Lost.”)\nFifteen years after the culture-war skirmish around Harold Bloom’s controversial defense of “The Western Canon” in literature, there’s a parallel debate over film.\nIs it possible to compile a universally recognized canon of the world’s greatest movies?\nIt won’t be easy, if the still-unresolved literary wars are any sign.\nThe debate has been precipitated by “Essential Art House,” a series of six-film DVD sets from the Criterion Collection, featuring titles from Janus Films. Janus is the theatrical distributor that introduced Americans to Federico Fellini and Ingmar Bergman and helped launch the art-house movie craze of the 1960s.\n“Essential Art House” — two sets are available, and the third goes on sale June 16 — includes all the usual suspects: Jean Cocteau, Jean Renoir, Akira Kurosawa, Andrzej Wajda, Francois Truffaut.\nEven if many movie buffs know that these directors should belong on any canon list, many would be hard-pressed to explain why. Most of us have come to believe that film appreciation is entirely subjective.\nTime magazine film critics Richard Corliss and Richard Schickel, who compiled the “Nemo”-friendly “All-Time 100 Movies” list in 2005, have no pretensions that their list is definitive.\n“This is just one of what must be a hundred 100-best-films lists,” Corliss writes.\nThere’s the rub: Best-of lists, even those by respected critics, seem arbitrary.\nCritic-turned-screenwriter and director Paul Schrader (“Taxi Driver,” “Affliction”) has argued that, as a society, we have become so afraid of being branded elitists that we are loath to judge films according to artistic excellence.\nIn an essay modeled after Bloom’s book, Schrader says academics and journalists have abdicated their role as arbiters of taste. He argues that film profs are more obsessed with analyzing the political subtext of movies, while the media churn out best-of lists defined by money and celebrity, not aesthetics.\nSchrader argues that the “great middle” of film criticism — serious yet accessible film discussion — has disappeared, pushed out on one side by jargon-filled academic studies, and on the other by mass-media film reviews that are little more than consumer guides.\nThe weekly box office report has become one of the public’s primary viewing guides.\nWe’re impressed that a washing machine, car, or shampoo is a best-seller, but aren’t artworks supposed to be qualitatively different?\nTry telling that to the American Film Institute, which compiles the “100 Years ... 100 Movies” list of American films from a survey of critics.\nAFI’s list, last updated in 2007, includes classics but is larded with pop fluff, including the ultimate celebration of American anti-intellectualism, “Forrest Gump” (1994), and it features five films by Steven Spielberg. (Five?) Worse, the list is part of the marketing campaign for an annual TV special.\nSchrader blames our growing film illiteracy on his late mentor and friend critic Pauline Kael, charging her with ushering in the contemporary dumbing-down of film.\nKael, whose influence on American film criticism cannot be exaggerated, mocked the idea of film-as-art and accused Bergman and Fellini of being pretentious bores.\nShe celebrated movies as “trash” and taught that critics should judge films for their emotional effect, rather than their formal qualities or intellectual content.\nThe Criterion series represents the sort of qualitative canon that Kael rejected.\nThese films demand active engagement from viewers by challenging preconceptions about our social structure and self-identity.\nKurosawa’s “Rashomon,” about witnesses to a crime who have totally different testimonies, shows how individual desires color how we see reality. Cocteau’s “Beauty and the Beast” proves that film can embody poetry, not just talk about it. Roman Polanski’s “Knife in the Water” critiques how social-power relations can deform the most private acts between lovers.\nPop films encourage passive viewing (the suspension of disbelief) and incite our most primitive emotions. For all his brilliance as a filmmaker — and he is a master of his craft — Spielberg manipulates music, color, framing, and composition to elicit specific emotional responses. (You may dislike “E.T.” as a movie, but I’ll bet you can’t help but cry when the alien says goodbye to the children.)\nSo, how to decide what films are art?\nSchrader offers five criteria, including a film’s beauty, its potential to become timeless, and how it elicits viewer engagement.\nBut if there’s one thing art resists, it’s being reduced to formulas. As Corliss says, “You can’t calibrate genius.”\nSchrader’s criteria are helpful, but the real arbiter is what the late University of Pennsylvania sociologist Philip Rieff called “the feeling intellect,” or taste — an elitist term, if there ever was one — cultivated over time.\nCorliss calls it experience.\nOne of the best ways to fine-tune one’s taste is to study Janus’ film catalog, which for decades has been taught in college film courses.\nBut the Janus-Criterion canon is less than definitive, since it mostly features the European films that inspired the first generation of art-film fans. (Kurosawa and Yasujiro Ozu were the only Asian directors then to make the cut.)\nSo, watch the “Essential Art House” series, then check out the new generation of great filmmakers, many of whom hail from Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, including Abbas Kiarostami, Bela Tarr, Carlos Diegues, Tsai Ming-liang, Gaspar Noe, Wong Kar-wai, Michael Haneke, Bruno Dumont, Lars von Trier and Hong Sang-soo.\nAs for the film canon, think of it more as an open question than as a Holy Grail waiting to be discovered.\nCRITERION ESSENTIAL ART HOUSE\nTitles included in the first four volumes of the Essential Art House DVD series released by the Criterion Collection in collaboration with Janus Films. Each boxed set costs $99.95. (Films also available for $19.95 each.)\nFor information about Criterion, visit www.criterion.com.

It has the force of law. The particular term used for this concept may vary from country to country.

In non-legal English usage, however, the term refers to any authoritarian decision.\nFor other uses of the term decree, see: Decree.\nDecree in Belgium refers to legislation passed by community or regional parliaments, except by the Brussels Parliament. Decrees have the same legal force as laws, the main difference being that laws can be passed only by the Federal Parliament.\nThe following legislative assemblies have the power to pass decrees: the Flemish Parliament, the Parliament of the French Community, the Walloon Parliament, the Parliament of the German-speaking Community and the Assembly of the French Community Commission, which is informally known as the Brussels Francophone Parliament. The Flemish counterpart of the Brussels Francophone Parliament, the Council of the Flemish Community Commission, does not have the power to pass decrees. Instead, it legislates by regulation.\nUnlike laws, decrees are not subject to royal assent. Decrees are not signed and promulgated by the king but instead are promulgated by the community or regional government or, in the case of the Brussels Francophone Parliament, by the College of the French Community Commission. Unlike ordinances, decrees are not subject to judicial review or to supervision by the federal government.\nDecree is a Canadian industrial band from Vancouver that was founded by Chris Peterson and John McRae in 1991.

In the usage of the canon law of the Catholic Church, it has various meanings. Any papal Bull, Brief, or Motu Proprio is a decree inasmuch as these documents are legislative acts of the Pope. In this sense the term is quite ancient. The Roman Congregations were formerly empowered to issue decrees in matters which come under their particular jurisdiction, but were forbidden from continuing to do so under Pope Benedict XV in 1917. Each ecclesiastical province, and also each diocese may issue decrees in their periodical synods within their sphere of authority.\nUsage examples of ""decree"".\nEach in my world, it seemed, carried about with him a bubble of space, a perimeter, a wall, an invisible shield, an unconsciously acculturated, socially sanctioned remoteness, a barrier decreed by convention and conditioning.\nTo make matters worse, Adams learned of further French seizures of American ships in the Caribbean and that by decrees issued in Paris, the Directory had, in effect, launched an undeclared war on American shipping everywhere.\nLoreley had decreed to attract a soul thither, or Amphion, the enchanter, intended there to build a city.\nDid I not decree that they be known as my Ansar, my helpers and partisans?\nIt was decreed that the faith and devotion of the Ansar should be rewarded.\nThey appeared to have patiently expected, and submissively obeyed, the decree of the senate which regulated the succession to the throne.\nFinding the Governor absent from Asuncion and lying under a decree suspending him from all his functions, it seems at once to have occurred to Antequera to seize his place.\nBut Nadar had decreed that both balloons should depart together, and had installed an extra windlass of rope for that purpose, reasoning that a dual launch would confuse and make even more ineffectual the rifle fire from the enemy lines.\nThe nursery of our greatest dramatists must be looked for, not, it is true, in the transfigured bear-gardens of the Bankside, but in those enchanted taverns, islanded and bastioned by the protective decree - IDIOTA, INSULSUS, TRISTIS, TURPIS, ABESTO.\nHe was also conscious that rank gave him the freedom to leave the battle line, except that the responsibility of command perversely decreed that he could not take that voluntary backward step.\nAfter all, he was at least a little bit of a mage, as well as a certified bonesetter and herb-Healer, and Selenay of Valdemar had decreed that Valdemar still needed mages.\nAlthough they are partly followers of Bramah and Pythagoras, they do not believe in the transmigration of souls, except in some cases, by a distinct decree of God.\nThe decree, the preamble of which Carnot insisted upon writing from my dictation, was drawn up in these terms.\nOver the end of the year, the two mathematicians, Casanova and Opiz, at the request of Count Waldstein, made a scientific examination of the reform of the calendar as decreed the 5th October 1793 by the National Convention.\nMy contact tells me that he can find no Chadian statutes, decrees, or court decisions that deal with found property.']"	['<urn:uuid:c32e9c99-a34a-4830-946b-9455c8369996>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	19	31	1369
5	dynamic routing protocols transport system vulnerabilities	Dynamic routing protocols like RIP, OSPF, ISIS, BGP, and IGRP allow network devices to learn network structure automatically from peers. However, this connectivity through industrial internet of things (IIoT) makes transport systems vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, particularly in digitized systems. These vulnerabilities can lead to disruptions such as interruption of traffic lights, electronic signals, and railway signal systems, as well as disruption of ticketing machines and blocked access to backend systems.	"['A route is the path that data takes when travelling through a network from one host to another. Routing is the process by which the path, or some subset of it, is determined. One of the characteristic features of the Internet, as compared to other network architectures, is that each node that receives a packet will typically determine for itself what the next step in the path should be.\nIP routing decisions are generally made based on the destination of network traffic. When an IP packet is sent from a node on the network, it will consult its routing table to determine the next hop device that the traffic should be sent to, in order for it to reach its final destination. The routing table on a typical home machine may look something like this (except formatted properly :):\nKernel IP routing table Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface x.y.z * 255.255.255.255 UH 0 0 0 ppp0 192.168.0.0 * 255.255.255.0 U 0 0 0 eth0 127.0.0.0 * 255.0.0.0 U 0 0 0 lo default x.y.z 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 0 ppp0\nSo, for example, when it receives a packet on interface eth0 which has a destination of 18.104.22.168, it will consult the table and see that it should send it through the default interface, the host x.y.z, which is on interface ppp0.\nThe routing table is constructed from a combination of statically defined routes and those learned from dynamic routing protocols.\nStatically defined routes may be declared at system boot time, or via a command line interface. They will generally include the following parameters:\n- Destination - this may be either a single host, or a network (in which case a network mask is also required).\n- Gateway - the device to which traffic with the defined destination should be sent.\nStatic routes may also include the following parameters:\n- Interface - the interface through which the traffic to a destination must be sent. (Most OSs can determine this automatically)\n- Metric - the number of \'hops\' away that the gateway is from this host. For a gateway that resides on a directly connected network, the metric is \'1\'.\nThe default route is a special case of a statically defined route. It is the route of last resort. All traffic that does not match another destination in the routing table is forwarded to the default gateway.\nDynamic routing protocols allow network attached devices to learn about the structure of the network dynamically from peer devices. This reduces the administrative effort required to implement and change routing throughout a network. Some examples of dynamic routing protocols are:\n- RIP (Routing Information Protocol)\n- OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)\n- ISIS (Intermediate system to intermediate system)\n- BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)\n- IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)\nISIS and OSPF are link-state protocols, meaning each node part of the same zone, will know the state of all the link in the mesh. Due to the exponential number of link in a mesh, thoses protocols are for small mesh such as an ISP national backbone.\nRIP is usually used to easily announce customer\'s routes in a backbone.\nBGP is used as an external routing protocol to exchange routes with other entities. ISP use BGP extensivly to ""trade"" their routes. It can also be used to carry customers routes accross a network, in a MPLS backbone for example.', 'Keeping transport safe, secure, and sustainable\nKeeping transport safe, secure, and sustainable\nWhether by rail, road, air, or sea, transport and logistics systems play a critical role in supporting the global infrastructure network. Today’s transportation systems are more sophisticated than ever, comprising complex plans, large volumes of real-time information, and connectivity through the industrial internet of things (IIoT).\nCybersecurity for the transportation sector faces two primary challenges:\nThe digitisation of railway systems, such as the European signaling ERTMS system (European Rail Traffic Management System), has made public transport systems vulnerable to a new generation of cybersecurity threats. In 2020 alone, ransomware attacks on the global transportation industry saw a 186% increase year-over-year.\nThese challenges require continuous updating of cybersecurity practices and new methodologies to keep transport systems agile. Failure to take action can be costly and disruptive, potentially exposing organisations to liability and legal action, particularly when customer data breaches are involved.\nAs global transportation and logistics networks continue to evolve alongside the rise of new technologies, organisations like yours must recognise the importance of cyber resilience and its ability to protect cargo and passengers.\nResilience to cybersecurity attacks requires more than just creating controls and processes. Your transport firm’s resilience begins and ends with the people in charge of data and assets. From IT personnel to executives, every employee must adopt a cybersecurity-first mindset. This means recognising that people are the first line of defence against threats. Through training and inhouse workshops, safety and security can be at the heart of your practises and corporate culture.\nThe rapid digitalisation of transport networks puts you at risk of disruptions caused by data breaches. As more devices and transport control systems depend on online connectivity, vulnerabilities will inevitably arise, increasing the potential for sensitive data to wind up in unscrupulous hands.\nWith new threats constantly emerging, you must do your due diligence to identify risks and shut down attacks before they affect operations. Steps that you can take to manage cybersecurity threats include:\nAt TÜV SÜD, our cybersecurity specialists provide advisory, assessment, training, audit, and certification services specifically designed for the transportation industry. Our solutions cover all aspects of IT security in the transportation sector, from rail cybersecurity and IT penetration testing to TS 50701 and IEC 62443 (railway) certification projects.\nOvercoming external and internal cybersecurity issues and threats to critical IT infrastructure requires expertise and experience. Powered by over 150 years of safety and security experience, TÜV SÜD delivers unbiased advice and trusted in-house safety and security workshops for transportation firms.\nAs a leader in helping organisations worldwide navigate through their digital transformation journey, TÜV SÜD is acutely aware of the cybersecurity challenges that come with digitalisation. We are here to work alongside your team to conduct comprehensive security tests and stay on top of new regulatory requirements in the transportation industry.\nWork with a trusted name in cybersecurity to ensure the resilience of your transportation networks and keep your customers’ data safe. Our team of 25,000 multidisciplinary experts from more than 1,000 locations around the world is here for you.\nAligning systems with security-by-design principles\nRailway companies must follow risk management procedures and conduct continuous auditing according to industry-specific guidance. Adhering to security-by-design principles ensures that the networks and technologies supporting your infrastructure are designed and built securely.\nMeeting KRITIS requirements for IT security\nIn Germany, KRITIS providers, such as water, food, electricity, and transport, are required under the IT Security Act 2.0 to demonstrate that they are enforcing cybersecurity measures to protect their systems. The constant threats you face require you to maintain the highest safety and security standards.\nSecuring products and systems data operational risks\nYour firm has a wide range of datasets flowing between physical and digital systems, allowing cybercriminals to hide in the heavy traffic to attack and control informational and operational data. Your IT infrastructure must have the appropriate security measures and defences in place to manage these risks.\nDetecting and responding to security incidents\nApart from compromised data, cybercrime can have a debilitating impact on railway companies due to disruptions like for example: 1. Interruption of traffic lights, electronic signals, toll booths, and railway signal systems 2. Disruption of ticketing machines and fare gates 3. Blocked access to backend systems and data\nPenalties and fines for non-compliance\nKRITIS organisations that fail to comply with industry regulations face fines of up to €20 million or up to 4% of their annual turnover, whichever is higher. Failure to comply with KRITIS regulations may also lead to imprisonment and the prosecution of responsible executives, managers, and personnel.\nEnsuring the availability and resilience of operational systems\nCyberattacks on transport networks can have lingering effects that last weeks, if not months. Attacks that can paralyse transportation systems and networks include: DDoS attacks, DNS attacks, credential stuffing, brute force attacks, DNS spoofing, malware, data manipulation and content theft, and phishing.\nA compact overview of the functional safety regulation landscape\nLearn more about the safety challenges for autonomous machinery\nLearn about current trends and challenges and get an overview about opportunities offered by functional safety.']"	['<urn:uuid:4798d511-2e1c-4349-a6bd-2f660c83339c>', '<urn:uuid:83c51e42-7251-472e-8c9a-d89ae9db46e6>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	6	71	1411
6	How do the concepts of Nirvana in Buddhism and Brahman in Hinduism compare in terms of being the ultimate spiritual goal?	In Hinduism, Brahman is described as the ultimate Divine Reality - a Supreme Principle rather than a being, characterized as 'infinite expansion,' 'Pure Consciousness,' and 'the eternal Reality.' Meanwhile in Buddhism, Nirvana represents the highest spiritual goal, described as a state of ultimate bliss and spirituality where the cycle of rebirth and death ends. While both represent ultimate spiritual states, Brahman is portrayed as an all-encompassing divine principle that one realizes their identity with, while Nirvana is portrayed as a state of enlightenment that one achieves by following the Eight-Fold Path and ending suffering.	['WHAT IS THE MAIN “BIBLE” OR SCRIPTURE FOR HINDUS? – WHAT IS THE HINDU VIEW OF GOD? – DO HINDUS BELIEVE IN CREATION AND TEACH CREATIONISM? – WHAT DOES HINDUISM SAY ABOUT THE END OF THE WORLD? – DOES THE WEST HAVE AN ACCURATE VIEW OF HINDUISM NOWADAYS?\nQ. What is the main “Bible” or Scripture for Hindus?\nA. There isn’t actually a main “Bible” or sole central scripture of Hinduism. There are many hundreds of different kinds of scriptures and spiritual texts belonging to the many different and diverse forms of the religion. Some which are well known include the Ramayana, the Vishnu Purana, Shrimad Bhagavatam (Bhagavata Purana), and Yoga Vasistha.\nThere are six divisions of Hindu scriptures and these – in order of general authority and importance – are (1) the Shrutis, (2) the Smritis, (3) the Itihasas, (4) the Puranas, (5) the Agamas, and (6) the Darshanas.\nHowever, there are three specific central scriptures which comprise the Prasthanatraya (“Triple Canon”) and these are the main and truly authoritative scriptures for a Hindu. They are the Upanishads, the Brahmasutras (Brahman Sutras), and the Bhagavad Gita.\nOf these three, the Brahmasutras are the least read, due to their being very abstruse and intellectually philosophical, and almost impossible to understand without the aid of a special commentary known as a Bhashya. Their aim and purpose is to expound and clarify the nature of Brahman, the Ultimate Reality, as presented in the Upanishads.\nRegarding the Upanishads, Swami Sivananda has written, “The Upanishads are the concluding portions of the Vedas or the end of the Vedas. The teaching based on them is called Vedanta. The Upanishads are the gist and the goal of the Vedas. They form the very foundation of Hinduism. … Even the Western scholars have paid their tribute to the seers of the Upanishads. At a time when the Westerners were clad in barks and were sunk in deep ignorance, the Upanishadic seers were enjoying the eternal bliss of the Absolute, and had the highest culture and civilisation.”\nThe Upanishads, the oldest of which were written at least 3,500 years ago, are timeless, beautiful, and inspiring treatises which all focus on the identity, unity, and literal sameness of the spiritual nature of the individual and the Divine Absolute Reality or, in other words, the Oneness of our Higher Self (Atman) with the Supreme Self (Brahman). The Upanishads describe Brahman as the ONE Infinite Divine Life and speak of the oneness, non-separateness, and inner divinity of all things. They are the source and the deepest and most profound expression in history of the spiritual teaching of non-duality and universal oneness.\nThe Bhagavad Gita, which literally means “Song of God” or “The Lord’s Song,” is without doubt the most popular and universally loved of all Hindu scriptures. It consists of a conversation between Krishna and Arjuna and is admired by multitudes around the world for its practical yet profound spiritual philosophy of life. It has been described as “the Manual of Life” and “the Gospel for the 21st Century.” Krishna is thought to represent the Higher Self and Arjuna the individual human soul, who must turn towards and seek refuge in that Self. Set on the scene of a battlefield, it in no way promotes or encourages war and violence as some enemies of Hinduism have ignorantly claimed, but rather symbolises the battlefield of life or “the war within,” which each of us must at some time face. Although not a particularly long book, it is truly an unforgettable classic of the world’s spiritual and religious literature.\nBeing part of the Vedas (the original foundational scriptures of Indian civilisation and the most ancient books known to man), the Upanishads are thus of the nature of Shruti, meaning direct revelation, and are thus ultimately the primary and final scriptural authority of the religion of Hinduism.\nQ. What is the Hindu view of God?\nA. The Upanishads very clearly and repeatedly explain that God – the Divine Absolute Reality – is not a Supreme Being but rather a Supreme Principle. It is referred to as Brahman, which can be translated as “infinite expansion.” It is acknowledged as being ultimately undefinable and indescribable but the Upanishads try their best by using such terms and phrases as “the divine Principle of existence,” “attributeless reality,” “the ground of existence,” “changeless, nameless, formless,” “Pure Consciousness,” “formless in the midst of forms, changeless in the midst of change, omnipresent and Supreme,” “the eternal Reality,” “without form and unconditioned,” “infinite and invisible,” “beyond all attributes,” “without body and without mind,” “without action or organs of action,” “beyond good and evil,” “beyond the reach of words and works,” “the indivisible unity of life,” and “That from which all words turn back and which thought can never reach.”\nThose are just a few examples out of hundreds of similar terms.\nSince Brahman is the ONE Life and the ONE Reality, it is said in Hinduism that there is nothing but Brahman and that thus Brahman is all there is, being all and in all. This is the main reason for Hindus revering all living beings and life itself as something sacred, precious, and divine. They know that Brahman is “the Only One,” “One without a second,” as the scriptures say.\nAnd so, in the highermost part of our being, in our essential nature as pure eternal spirit, we too are Brahman, this “Eternal Light” and “Infinite Life.” This is why the Vedanta philosophy speaks constantly of man’s identity and oneness with the Divine. Many Hindus will meditate upon and affirm the statement “Aham Brahmasmi” – “I am Brahman.”\nSince Brahman is recognised as being absolute, infinite, immutable, and unconditioned, It can thus have nothing finite, conditioned, or anthropomorphic about Itself, such as form, personality, physical appearance, name and human-like characteristics, etc. Rather than being a “He,” it is taught that Brahman is to be reverentially referred to as “IT” since to do otherwise would surely be an attempt to drag the purely Spiritual and purely Divine down to the physical, material, human level, whereas we should be endeavouring instead to raise and elevate ourselves in consciousness up towards the purely Spiritual and Divine, for That is who and what we truly and eternally are.\nHowever, as well as being an expressly monist or monistic religion, Hinduism is also pluralistic in that it not merely permits but actively encourages everyone to relate to God or the Divine in the way that suits them best and which appeals to them the most. The above may be somewhat unpalatable for some and so we also find many Hindus viewing and worshipping God as a Supreme Being with personal characteristics. Many acknowledge and accept that behind their anthropomorphic concept of God there is the Infinite Brahman Principle but they feel that it is more beneficial and helpful for them personally to give a more human and comprehensible touch to It, characterising It as Vishnu, Krishna (who is considered to have been the supreme Avatar of Vishnu), Shiva, Ganesha, Rama, one of the representations of the Divine Mother, or indeed anyone or anything else of their choosing.\nThis is accepted and celebrated in the vastly diverse and open religion of Hinduism, where many differing viewpoints and perspectives live harmoniously side by side, yet it cannot be denied that the Upanishads teach of a Supreme Pure Divine Consciousness which is everything and in everything, rather than a Supreme Being modelled in the image and likeness of us human beings.\nThe Hindu Trinity or Trimurti is comprised of Brahmā (note the important distinction between Brahmā and Brahman; they are not the same!), Vishnu, and Shiva. Their roles are popularly described as Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer. It is said that at the appointed time Brahmā-Vishnu-Shiva comes forth from Brahman and causes the universe to come into being. Brahmā performs the initial task of evolution into manifestation, Vishnu then preserves and sustains the whole universe until finally the universal life cycle reaches its appointed end, whereupon Shiva destroys it all.\nPhilosophically speaking, Brahmā, Vishnu, and Shiva are not three distinct “beings” or entities but are the three different aspects of the One all-ensouling Life of the Universe or, in other words, Brahmā-Vishnu-Shiva is the Living Universe itself…self-evolving (when it radiates forth from the absoluteness of Brahman), self-sustaining, and finally self-dissolving, whereupon everything is completely reabsorbed back into Brahman until eventually the universe has to be reborn, just as everything in Nature is constantly being reborn and following a cyclic pattern.\nQ. Do Hindus believe in Creation and teach Creationism?\nA. Although the terms “Creation” and “Creator” are used in various places in Hinduism, this is an unfortunate choice of word and in some cases is simply a mistranslation into English, since what Hinduism teaches is not Creationism but rather a very broad and far reaching system of Evolution.\nIt is widely unknown or at least often overlooked in Western civilisation that Hinduism, along with other Indian religions such as Buddhism and Jainism, believed in and taught evolution thousands of years before Darwin came along. Hinduism does not deny but readily affirms that evolution is a fact and that all manifestation is in a continual state of change, transformation, and progressive development into higher and better adapted forms, affecting the species of animals as well as the vegetable kingdom and everything else, humanity included.\nAnd since Hinduism upholds the idea of non-duality and the Oneness of Brahman, it has to deny creation in the literal sense of the word, since if Brahman is all there is then nothing – no new thing – can ever be created, since that would imply duality and multiplicity and thus negate the non-dualistic ideal as well as unphilosophically implying that infinite impersonal Oneness somehow has the intention and ability to personally make things out of nothing.\nIt is maintained that Brahman emanates Itself, through Itself, within Itself, and as Itself. It cannot be otherwise, since Brahman is the One and Only Reality; Absolute Infinite EXISTENCE Itself. Thus emanation and evolution are facts, whereas creation as commonly understood and portrayed in the Abrahamic religions is not.\nOne important difference between the modern scientific view of evolution and the Hindu view is that Hinduism says that the most important aspect of evolution is not the evolution of the outer material form but the constant gradual progression, development, unfoldment, and advancement of the inner life entity through a long series of changing physical forms and experiences, eventually working its way up to the human kingdom and beyond. In other words, inner evolution is much more important than outer evolution because ultimately only the inner survives and endures and everything external, material, and objective must eventually disappear and cease to be.\nQ. What does Hinduism say about the end of the world?\nA. Hinduism teaches an ever-ongoing process of the cyclic appearance and disappearance of the universe and everything in it. This again is an aspect of the cosmic and universal system of evolution as propounded in the Hindu religion. This alternating process of the existence and non-existence of the universe is known as Manvantara and Pralaya or the Days and Nights of Brahmā, since Brahmā represents the universe itself.\nFollowing the cyclically occurring dissolution of the universe, there is complete rest, absolute inactivity, nothing manifest or objective whatsoever, and a complete reabsorption in Brahman. This remains for the exact same duration as the universe had previously been in manifested objective existence, the life span of the universe being said to always be a period of 311,040,000,000,000 years.\nAfter that, the whole process of universal evolution begins all over again, with everything now raised to a higher level than it was before.\nThus the universe itself is ultimately only a temporary and impermanent thing (hence it being called “maya” or illusion) and its contents such as the solar systems and planets even more so, since they die and are reborn a multitude of times within the universal life cycle. Our world will therefore eventually come to its end, only to later be reborn or “reincarnated” in some way, but this will not and cannot happen until the appointed cyclic time and according to the calculations and calendars of the ancient Hindus that time is still an incredibly long way off.\nQ. Does the West have an accurate view of Hinduism nowadays?\nA. Unfortunately not. Despite being the world’s third largest religion and 15% of the world’s population identifying themselves as Hindus, the religion and its teachings and practices are still sorely misunderstood and misrepresented here in the West, with many people not actually knowing anything about it at all. To the average person in the street, the word “Hinduism” signifies a strange, impenetrable, chaotic, colourful world filled with hundreds or thousands of peculiar gods or deities with many limbs, many heads, and unnaturally coloured skin.\nIt’s true that a few terms and concepts that originate in Hinduism have filtered into popular Western usage, such as karma, reincarnation, yoga, mantras, and so forth, and quite a lot of people are aware that karma and reincarnation play some sort of role in the Hindu philosophy but that’s about all they know at the very most and those terms themselves are often either partially or severely misunderstood, particularly in the case of yoga. But then again, the average Westerner doesn’t know very much at all about Christianity either, despite most of the Western nations still being nominally Christian countries…so perhaps we shouldn’t be overly concerned about this at the moment.\nWhat is a cause of concern is that even the majority of spiritually interested people have a warped view of Hinduism, often falling into one of the two extremes of either erroneously equating tantric things such as Kundalini awakening and the chakras (which play an extremely minor and virtually inconsequential role in the teachings and general practices of Hinduism) with Hinduism at large or alternatively assuming that Hinduism as a whole is a type of Bhakti movement with the central focus on worshipful devotion of a Supreme Being figure and various deities.\nThe first erroneous view is largely due to the New Age movement which is famous for misrepresenting, misunderstanding, and grossly distorting numerous aspects and teachings of Eastern religions. New Agers spend their time – and money! – attempting to “cleanse,” “unblock” and “heal” their chakras, naively believing the claims of various writers and teachers that this is actually an ancient and prominent practice of the Indian sages, whilst in reality the Indian sages observe such nonsense with pity and cannot help but laugh. The second view is often formed by someone visiting a Hare Krishna temple, for example, and then automatically assuming that all of Hinduism is like that.\nThose who are genuinely and sincerely interested in gaining a clear and deep understanding of the heart of Hinduism, which is Vedanta, may perhaps have some idea where to look after reading this article. One excellent and influential new endeavour is the “Upanishad Ganga” television series from Chinmaya Creations, which is part of the organisation founded by the late Swami Chinmayananda, one of the most widely respected and beloved teachers of Advaita Vedanta in modern times. The first seventeen episodes of the 52 episode series are now widely available on DVD, complete with perfect English subtitles, and many more episodes other than those first seventeen can be freely watched, albeit without subtitles, on YouTube.\nDespite some of the current misunderstandings and misconceptions, it is believed that the teachings of Hinduism – or Sanatana Dharma – will soon begin to play a new and more influential role in the world than ever before. It’s surprising how many people say, once they learn more about Hinduism, that they have always believed and known such things to be true. Such is the nature of the world’s oldest and perhaps most universal religion.\n~ BlavatskyTheosophy.com ~\nSOME RELATED ARTICLES: Gandhi on Blavatsky and Theosophy, The Theosophy of the Bhagavad Gita, The Life & Times of Adi Shankaracharya, Ramalingam Pillai and the Theosophical Movement, The Three Gunas, Trimurti – The Hindu Trinity, The Mandukya Upanishad, The Seven Yugas, Our Mother India, Who are you, Madame Blavatsky?, Is Theosophy Hinduism, Buddhism, or Something Else? and Esoteric Symbolism.', 'Discuss on our China Forum with\nother visitors of Chinaorbit about Chinese culture\nliving and studying in China\nHistory of the first Buddha\nBuddhism began thousands of years ago in India by Siddhartha Gautama the first â€œBuddhaâ€, meaning â€œthe enlightened oneâ€. As a young boy Siddhartha lived the life as a royal prince privileged and sheltered from the evils and sufferings outside the royal palace gate in India. He soon witnessed and was astonished by the sufferings of human beings. Disabled, disease, old age, and death plagued the people of the kingdom. Siddhartha journeyed alone to find the answer in order to abolish human suffering. Under a Bolhi tree he meditated and starved enduring sufferings himself hoping it would lead him to the answers he was looking for. One full moon night in May, the answers came to him and he quickly understood the meaning and cycle of life; birth, death and rebirth. This enlightenment realization ended his spiritual journey and from this point forward he became â€œthe Buddhaâ€. He understood that his mission in life was to teach and spread the principles of Buddhism to anyone and everyone no matter their rank of class or gender.\nThe Four Noble Truths\nOne of Buddhaâ€™s first philosophies in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: Dukkha, Tanha, Nirvana, and The Eight Fold Path. These truths show his view towards human life and human suffering.\nThe first noble truth explains that suffering exists. This suffering can be in the form of pain, sickness, loss, separation, or even unsatisfied feelings.\nThe second noble truth tells us that there is a cause for suffering. The origin of\nsuffering is the attachment to desires or cravings. These desires may take the form of such things such as sexual pleasures, fame, or fortune.\nThe third noble truth informs you that there is an end to suffering. If you can let go of your desires and free yourself from attachment, you can end suffering.\nThe Eight Fold Path\nThe fourth noble truth shows you the way to end suffering. To stop suffering one must follow the Eight Fold Path which is a guideline for living everyday life. These values are Right Understanding, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration.\nBuddha teachings believe that you are responsible for your own actions. Karma, meaning â€œactionâ€, is the belief that intentional good actions bring happiness and that intentional bad actions bring suffering. These actions determine your next life when you are reborn.\nThe Buddha had seen all of his previous lives before him during his meditated\nenlightenment. He followed the idea of rebirth, meaning that we are reborn once your current life has ended. Your next life could be in any of the six realms: the hell realm, the realm of the hungry ghosts, the animal world, the human realm, the realm of the jealous gods and the heavens. The actions from your previous life influence the next realm you will be reborn in. Reaching true Nirvana and enlightenment in the human realm is the Buddhist highest goal. Here the cycle of rebirth and death is over and a state of ultimate bliss and spirituality is met.']	['<urn:uuid:d62e8167-2724-4cb6-b86c-0d9c3b077f9b>', '<urn:uuid:6a8d0972-05f5-4785-a2a4-d4529c2b75c5>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	21	94	3244
7	Can radiation and eye removal both treat eye cancer?	Yes, both options are available for treating eye melanoma. According to an NIH clinical trial called COMS, for medium size tumors, patient survival rates are the same whether the eye is removed or treated with radiation. While radiation usually reduces vision, it often allows preserving some degree of vision, unlike eye removal.	['External beam radiation therapy treatments\nThe goal of radiation therapy is to get enough radiation into the body to kill the cancer cells while preventing damage to healthy tissue. There are several ways to do this. Depending on the location, size and type of cancer, you may receive one or a combination of techniques. Your treatment team will help you to decide which treatments are best for you.\nRadiation therapy can be delivered in two ways, externally and internally. During external beam radiation therapy, the radiation oncology team uses a machine to direct high-energy X-rays at the cancer. Internal radiation therapy, or brachytherapy, involves placing radioactive sources (for example, radioactive seeds) inside your body.\nExternal Beam Radiation Therapy\nDuring external beam radiation therapy, a beam of radiation is directed through the skin to the cancer and the immediate surrounding area in order to destroy the main tumor and any nearby cancer cells. To minimize side effects, the treatments are typically given five days a week, Monday through Friday, for a number of weeks. This allows doctors to get enough radiation into the body to kill the cancer while giving healthy cells time each day to recover.\nThe radiation beam is usually generated by a machine called a linear accelerator. The linear accelerator, or linac, is capable of producing high-energy X-rays and electrons for the treatment of your cancer. Using high-tech treatment planning software, your treatment team controls the size and shape of the beam, as well as how it is directed at your body, to effectively treat your tumor while sparing the surrounding normal tissue.\nSeveral special types of external beam therapy are discussed in the next sections. These are used for specific types of cancer, and your radiation oncologist will recommend one of these treatments if he or she believes it will help you.\nThree-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy (3D-CRT)\nTumors are not regular — they come in different shapes and sizes. Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, or 3D-CRT, uses computers and special imaging techniques to show the size, shape and location of the tumor. Computer assisted tomography (CT or CAT scans), magnetic resonance imaging (MR or MRI scans) and/or positron emission tomography (PET scans) are used to create detailed, three-dimensional representations of the tumor and surrounding organs. Your radiation oncologist can then precisely tailor the radiation beams to the size and shape of your tumor with multileaf collimators (see picture, right) or custom fabricated field shaping blocks. Because the radiation beams are very precisely directed, nearby normal tissue receives less radiation and is able to heal quickly.\nIntensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)\nIntensity modulated radiation therapy, or IMRT, is a specialized form of 3D-CRT that allows radiation to be more exactly shaped to fit the tumor. With IMRT, the radiation beam can be broken up into many “beamlets,” and the intensity of each beamlet can be adjusted individually. Using IMRT, it may be possible to further limit the amount of radiation that is received by healthy tissue near the tumor. In some situations, this may also allow a higher dose of radiation to be delivered to the tumor, potentially increasing the chance of a cure.\nProton Beam Therapy\nProton beam therapy is a form of external beam radiation treatment that uses protons rather than X-rays to treat certain types of cancer and other diseases. The physical characteristics of the proton therapy beam allow doctors to more effectively reduce the radiation dose to nearby healthy tissue. Proton therapy is available at only a few specialized centers in the country.\nNeutron Beam Therapy\nLike proton therapy, neutron beam therapy is a specialized form of external beam radiation therapy. It is often used to treat certain tumors that are radioresistant, meaning that they are very difficult to kill using conventional X-ray radiation therapy. Neutrons have a greater biologic impact on cells than other types of radiation. Used carefully, this added impact can be an advantage in certain situations. Neutron therapy is available at only a few specialized centers.\nStereotactic radiotherapy is a technique that allows your radiation oncologist to precisely focus beams of radiation to destroy certain types of tumors. Since the beam is so precise, your radiation oncologist may be able to spare more healthy tissue. This additional precision is achieved by using a very secure immobilization, such as a head frame used in the treatment of brain tumors. Stereotactic radiotherapy is frequently given in a single dose (sometimes called radiosurgery) although certain situations may require more than one dose. In addition to treating some cancers, radiosurgery can also be used to treat malformations in the brain’s blood vessels and certain noncancerous (benign) neurologic conditions.\nSometimes a high dose of stereotactic radiotherapy can be focused upon a tumor outside the brain and given in a few treatments (typically three to eight). This form of treatment is called stereotactic body radiation therapy.\nImage Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT)\nRadiation oncologists use image guided radiation therapy, or IGRT, to help better deliver the radiation to the cancer since tumors can move between treatments due to differences in organ filling or movements while breathing. IGRT involves conformal radiation treatment guided by imaging, such as CT, ultrasound or X-rays, taken in the treatment room just before the patient is given the radiation treatment. All patients first undergo a CT scan as part of the planning process. The imaging information from the CT scan is then transmitted to a computer in the treatment room to allow doctors to compare the earlier image with the images taken just before treatment. During IGRT, doctors compare these images to see if the treatment needs to be adjusted. This allows doctors to better target the cancer while avoiding nearby healthy tissue. In some cases, doctors will implant a tiny marker in or near the tumor to pinpoint it for IGRT.', 'Melanoma of the uvea or choroidal melanoma\nOur skin has pigment cells, called melanocytes. Pigment cells in your skin can develop into a mole, or “nevus.” That mole or nevus can grow and become a malignant melanoma.\nLike your skin, the eye has a tremendous amount of pigment cells, or melanocytes. Pigment cells in the eye can also develop into a mole, or nevus. Likewise, malignant melanoma can originate inside the eye, within the “uvea” or choroidal layer of the eye. The melanoma originates from pigmented cells in the eye.\nMelanoma inside the eye may decrease vision or cause a shadow in vision and thus come to attention. Alternatively, melanoma inside the eye may have no symptoms and be discovered on a regular routine eye exam.\nMalignant melanoma inside the eye can eventually travel via the bloodstream outside the eye, often to the liver, lung, or other body organs, and eventually cause death from metastasis. Thus melanoma inside the eye needs to be treated.\nThe eye can be removed. Even if the eye is removed as soon as the tumor is discovered, there is a chance that microscopic cells from the melanoma have already traveled outside the eye, perhaps to the liver. We recommend a medical exam and PET scan to look to see if melanoma has traveled outside the eye at the time of initial diagnosis. However, it is very important to realize that the PET scan or CT scan may be negative or normal, but small cells from the eye melanoma may have still gotten outside of the eye. Those cells may simply be undetectable in the beginning and only show up years later.\nThe alternative to taking the eye out is to treat the eye with radiation. An NIH clinical trial called the COMS study (see links below) showed that, for medium size tumors, survival is the same whether you take the eye out or whether you treat with radiation. The radiation usually reduces vision in the eye, but often some degree of vision is preserved.\nRadiation to the eye can be performed in two ways. Here in Oklahoma City, we treat melanoma inside the eye with Iodine 125 plaque radiation.We sew a special radiation treated plate or “plaque” to the eye and let the plaque stay there for 5 days, during which the plaque irradiates the tumor. The patient stays in the hospital during those 5 days. This plaque technique was used in the COMS study.\nThe alternative technique is proton beam therapy. In terms of which works best, for the majority of tumors Iodine 125 plaque therapy and proton beam therapy work equally well. For some tumors, especially tumors wrapped around the optic nerve (“circumpapillary tumor”), proton beam therapy is better.\nIf a patient wants proton beam therapy rather than Iodine 125 therapy, or the patient’s tumor is a “circumpapillary tumor” that will do better with proton beam, Dr. Dahr will refer you to Evangelos Gragoudas, M.D. at the Francis Burr Proton Therapy Center at Harvard University in Boston. Dr. Gragoudas developed proton beam therapy for the eye 30 years ago. His team is the most experienced in the world in proton beam therapy for the eye.\nFor patients and their primary care doctors and oncologists:Patients with uveal melanoma or suspected of having uveal melanoma should have a baseline medical examination with imaging.']	['<urn:uuid:6b49e6c7-ca02-4704-99cb-92c440dad3d5>', '<urn:uuid:7565922c-4f60-4f07-ac85-feff283fc5ab>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	9	52	1526
8	As a surgeon specializing in minimally invasive procedures, I'm curious about the potential complications that could arise during knee arthroscopic surgery. What are the key risks we need to consider?	While arthroscopic surgery is generally safe, there are several potential complications to consider. Severe local problems, including infections, occur in less than 1 in 1,000 patients. About 5-10% of patients may experience significant swelling that takes time to resolve. Venous thrombosis can occur but is uncommon. In rare cases, parts of the instruments can break, though these can usually be retrieved. Sometimes the operation cannot be completed through small puncture wounds and may require an open incision. Additionally, there are risks associated with general anesthetic, though these are very rare in young people.	['Because of the increased emphasis of physical fitness, knee injuries are becoming more common not only in athletes, but also in the general population.\nArthroscopy is the examination of the inside of the knee with a fibreoptic probe. It has become one of the most frequently\nused and accurate tools for diagnosis and treatment of knee injuries. It is a surgical procedure which is performed as a day\nThrough a few small incisions the surgeon can insert the arthroscopy instruments into your knee. The arthroscope allows\nthe surgeon to see the entire knee joint, and some injuries or disorders, such as a cartilage tear, can be treated by removal\nof the loose segment of the cartilage or, on occasion, repair.\nTo help you understand your knee injury and the need for the arthroscopy it helps to know a little about the anatomy of a normal knee.\nSome of the more common knee problems include meniscus injuries, ligament injuries, degenerative disorders and patella derangements\nMENISCUS INJURIES - Menisci are the shock absorbing pads of cartilage in your knee. They may tear, split or fray\nDEGENERATIVE DISORDERS - These are caused by changes in the joint surface cartilage. The cartilage may be rough or worn.\nLIGAMENT INJURIES - Ligaments hold the bones together and stabilize your knee. Ligaments may tear completely or partially.\nPATELLA DERANGEMENTS - The patella is the round bone in the front of your knee. It may be rough underneath or may not be in the correct\nRisks and Benefits of Arthroscopic Surgery\nJust because your knee hurts it does not mean an arthroscopy is indicated. Your surgeon will question you and examine your knee. An ordinary X-ray is usually performed. A MRI scan can be helpful and, if normal, it is rare that an arthroscopy will be helpful to you.\nIf there are true mechanical features in your knee i.e. locking, giving way, jamming, it is more likely a remedial problem that can be identified and put right, such as a torn cartlidge.\nYour surgeon will have given you some indication of the likely benefits of the procedure at consultation.\nAll operations under general anaesthetic have potential complications. Those associated with the anaesthetic are very rare in young people. Rarely are there severe local problems, which can include infections and which are less common than 1 in 1,000 patients who undergo arthroscopy. Perhaps 5-10% of patients, depending on the procedures undertaken, will have significant swelling that can take a while to go down. Venous thrombosis can occur but is uncommon.\nIn a sense, one of the most significant absences of benefit is that nothing is found that can be put right and you may continue with your symptoms. On rare occasions parts of the instruments can break and can usually be retrieved. On rare occasions the operation cannot be completed through the very small puncture wounds where the endoscope is inserted and an open incision may have to be undertaken. We cannot always advise you of this in advance and it is wise to consider that this is always a possibility. It does not mean that a major complication has occurred but it may slow your recovery down and you may have a little more pain and need physiotherapy and splintage or crutches for a slightly longer period.\nThe surgeons at Basford Consulting Rooms are trained and highly skilled in this procedure.\nYou will generally be called up to the hospital about one or two weeks before the proposed date of your operation. This allows doctors and nurses to check to see you are medically fit for the anaesthetic and operation. Fresh x-rays and blood tests may be taken.\nYou will be questioned about your current health and past medical, surgical or medication history. Particularly important things to tell the nurse or doctor about are:\n* any heart problems\n* asthma or any particular shortness of breath problems\n* any bad reactions to a previous anaesthetic\nThis is an opportunity to tell the nurse of any worries or special needs when you return home after your operation. The operation should not be performed if there are any active infections. If any infections, including a bad cold occurs before your admission, please telephone the Hospital Admissions Officer or Basford Consulting Rooms.\nYou must bring all your current medicines prescribed by your doctor to the Assessment Clinic and on admission to the ward.\nSmokers must stop prior to surgery to lessen the likelihood of a post-operative chest infection.\nHowever, if you are young, fit and healthy, a pre-operative assessment is usually not required.\nMost arthroscopic surgery of the knee is undertaken as a day patient procedure under general anaesthetic. Do not eat anything or drink anything after midnight, unless otherwise instructed by the doctor at the hospital.\nWhat to bring to the Hospital\nFor day case surgery, personal toiletries may be brought in. Bring your routine medication with you and take routine medicines only as directed by the Anaesthetist or Surgeon.\nMake arrangements to have a responsible adult available to drive you home after discharge following your day surgery. You will not be allowed to leave the hospital alone. You must not drive the same day as a general anaesthetic.\nAfter admission to the Hospital\nAfter you are admitted there will be further discussion with the day surgery nursing staff. You may be visited by a physiotherapist who will advise you of simple muscle bracing exercises. Any special post-operative exercises or rehabilitation needs will be indicated.\nBefore the procedure the Anaesthetist will talk to you and assess the most suitable form of anaesthetic, most often a general anaesthetic (being put to sleep). At any time please ask about the anaesthetic and post-operative analgesia. You may be given a pre-medication to make your wait less anxious.\nYou will be taken to the operating theatre on a trolley or bed. After the procedure there will be a light dressing on the knee.\nAfter your Operation\nYou will be observed and monitored for a short period in the Recovery Bay area which is close to the theatre. You may have a small drip in a vein which will be removed later on the Ward. Once you are breathing comfortably you will be allowed back in the ward to the Day Unit. You may remain in the Day Unit for an hour or so but this may vary according to the surgical procedure and the type of anaesthesia. Various checks on your blood pressure etc will be taken and your circulation, sensation and comfort will be assessed.\nBefore discharge you will be asked to stand and walk. You may feel tired and dizzy but this is a normal reaction following anaesthesia. The nurse will be there to assist you and advise. The nursing staff are trained to assess whether you are safe to go home. If you cannot perform a straight leg raise, i.e. have good limb control, the nursing staff may advise a splint and they or the physiotherapists will assess the need for walking aids (crutches).\nAnalgesics (medication) for pain will be provided for you to take if you have severe pain. You should not drink alcohol when you are taking the medication. As your recovery progresses Paracetamol should be sufficient.\nYou may feel a little drowsy for 24 or 48 hours and you should have someone at home. You must put as much weight on the operated leg as has been advised by your surgeon or physiotherapist. Keep your bandages clean and dry and do not remove them until you return to the clinic or as instructed by your surgeon. The dressing should not come into contact with water. If you bathe, cover the bandaged leg with a plastic bag, fastening securely beyond the upper edge of the bandage or dressing, with tape. There may be a small amount of pink or red drainage through the outer surface of the dressing, which is normal. If this increases in amount over a 12 hour period you should report this to the Day Unit or to your General Practitioner.\nElevate the operated leg, if possible, in the first 48 hours and an application of an ice pack will also help reduce any pain and swelling. When sleeping a pillow should be used to keep your leg up. Elevation in the first few days is a precaution that can prevent post-operative complications.\nThese are general exercises and you may be advised to modify them by the physiotherapist or your surgeon, according to the different circumstances. You must practice these exercises because if you do not, the knee may feel weak and there may be a sensation of giving way.\nThe quadricep is the front of knee muscle. Tighten this muscle to make your kneecap move. Hold this contraction for 5 counts and then relax. This exercise is done with the leg straight and can be performed standing, sitting, or lying down.\nStraighten supported leg with thee opposite leg off the side. Slowly lean forward until you feel a stretch at the back of your knee. Hold stretch for 10 counts. Do this with chin up, back straight, and without bouncing.\nTERMINAL KNEE EXTENSION\nLie on your back and place a towel roll under your knee allowing your knees to bend slightly. Lift heel in order to straighten your leg. Hold for a count of 5 and then relax.\nSTRAIGHT LEG RAISE WITH HEEL LIFT\nLie on your back and place a towel roll under your knee allowing it to bend slightly. Bend your opposite knee to protect your low back. Lift your heel in order to straighten your leg. Once the leg is as straight as possible, lift the entire leg to height of opposite knee. Hold for 3-5 counts and relax.\nTo add resistance, secure weight on top of thigh. Begin with 1-2 Lbs and gradually increase.The physiotherapist will advise you with regard to this.\nSTRAIGHT LEG RAISE\nLie on your back with opposite knee bent. Tighten the knee muscle performing a quad set. Lift your leg straight up slightly lower than your bent knee and hold 3-5 counts. The knee should be straight throughout the lift. Relax leg between each lift.\nTo add resistance, secure weight on ankle. Begin with 1-2 lbs and gradually increase.\nRest 30 seconds to 1 minute between each set of 10.\nCONCERNED? - CONTACT US\nContact the Day Unit nurse or your General Practitioner if the following occurs:\n* tingling, (pain or numbness in your toes which is not relieved by elevating\nyour foot for a period of one hour)\n* foul smell with discharge or drainage from your bandage\n* mouth temperature above 38.5ºC or 101 .3ºF\n* pain in the operated leg which is not relieved by test, leg elevation or']	['<urn:uuid:9b0d69cd-28cc-4b54-99d6-3ebdde465590>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	30	93	1796
9	As someone interested in sustainable development, I'd like to know how mining companies evaluate their projects' economic potential and what effect does mining have on local wildlife and plant life?	Companies evaluate mining projects by estimating revenues, operating costs and margins, analyzing resource grades, and determining production rates. However, mining operations can severely disrupt ecosystems - they cause deforestation, threaten plant species and wildlife populations, and can wipe out biodiversity in the area. The damage can persist long after mining ends, potentially turning these areas into lifeless wastelands when proper environmental management is not followed.

10	international student exchange program columbia icep vs cornell global health case competition team composition requirements compare	Columbia ICEP accepts medical students from partner universities along with select students from health professions programs and premedical undergraduates, while the Cornell Global Health Case Competition specifically requires teams to be composed of four students - two undergraduate students and two graduate students.	"[""The International Collaboration and Exchange Program - Preparing Global Leaders for Healthcare (“Columbia ICEP”), was initiated in 2014 within the Anatomy/Pathology Department at the Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University in New York City, NY, USA (Department Chairman: Kevin Roth, MD, PhD; Program Director: Anette Wu, MD, MPH, PhD). It partners over 20 major leading medical universities on 4 continents.\nThe program is an international student networking and exchange program specifically designed for junior medical students - originating from within the anatomy course and created by faculty and students to promote the improvement of global healthcare.\nThe overall objective of this program is to prepare students in the health professions for international leadership roles in their countries and global collaborative problem solving in healthcare.\nThe program is open to all medical students from our partner universities. In addition, the program accepts select students from related partner health professions programs (i.e., dental, health sciences graduate schools, schools of public health, anatomy and pharmacy students), and select partner premedical undergraduates, based on academic achievement and interests. We particularly welcome international students at our partner schools to join and enrich students' experiences with cultural diversity and to share their knowledge about healthcare and health related topics in their home countries.\nVia multidirectional exchanges with students from major international universities, the program provides students with leadership skills, cultural competency skills, international experience, and networking opportunities – resulting in raised awareness about differences in healthcare delivery systems and global public health challenges, improvement of cultural competency, acquisition of basic sciences research experience, development of leadership and multi-lateral international collaboration skills, and global healthcare problem solving.\nAll of these competencies are important for global leaders in healthcare. Early peer-to-peer interactions are expected to form collegiality, long-term bonding, and friendships, and help to improve global healthcare in the future.\nThe program provides students with a stepwise opportunity to share and exchange cultural and healthcare related knowledge.\nFall (October to May)\nInternational small peer group work initiates discussions about shared topics (e.g., comparison of healthcare systems, health ethics and law challenges, advancements in biotechnology, reflections on the topic of anatomy body donation, and thoughts on experiences during the global pandemic).\nLarge group discussions, platform debates and conference presentations train students for international public speaking while socializing in medium size groups online.\nThe program culminates in optional multi-directional international short-term basic sciences internships, to enhance basic sciences skills via immersion into an academic life abroad and/or virtual student research groups.\nExpert international faculty lecture series introduce students to areas of healthcare and Public Health that are often not part of the regular medical curriculum.\nSummer (June to August)\nAn optional condensed 8-week virtual summer program enhances leadership skills and scientific knowledge, as a replacement for, or in addition to summer exchange travel on select timely topics in healthcare that affect everyone. The summer program are themed and include weekly international faculty lectures.\nA final year international elective on cultural competency and food is offered in spring for senior medical students.\nStudents acquire skills that will enhance their careers and prepare them for leadership roles.\nWe take great pride in emphasizing the networking component of the program.\nFurther continuation into the clinical years is in the planning phase.\nSee program overview for further information and registration.\nCheck out our program video here:"", 'Global Health Case Competition - FAQs\nWhat is the Global Health Case Competition?\nThe Global Health Case Competition gives students from all backgrounds the opportunity to develop a realistic, innovative, and transdisciplinary solution to a global health problem.

11	What was the main difference between regular French soldiers and the elite troops like voltigeurs in terms of their uniform accessories?	The regular fusilier companies wore a single shoulder belt, while the elite voltigeurs and grenadiers were distinguished by wearing crossbelts.	"['Webmaster\'s notes: French infantry battalions were composed of fusilier (center) companies and voltigeur and grenadier companies. There were several fusilier companies in a battalion but only one each of voltigeurs and grenadiers. These last were considered elite troops. The voltigeurs were usually smaller men and able to act independently. They were used as light infantry skirmishers in front of the main line, harassing the enemy, fighting enemy skirmishers or as scouts. The grenadiers were big men and used as shock troops or for shock action.\nThe fusilier companies were distinguished by blue facings, the voltigeurs by green or yellow facings and the grenadiers by red facings. The fusiliers were also distinguished by having a single shoulder belt, the elite voltigeurs and grenadiers had crossbelts.\nOur Young Guard figures are post 1812 and single shoulder belted (they wore crossbelts before 1812), the other belt with the sabre-briquet was removed. These Young Guard figures can therefore be also used as French fusiliers in greatcoats. (Many thanks to both Alfred Umhey and Dan Peterson for providing this information.)\nSeveral visitors have also commented that of the 3 sets of French Line Infantry on the market (Airfix, ESCI and Italeri) only Airfix\'s French Infantry are correctly uniformed. Prior to 1812, the French line infantry wore a coat with an inverted V front (revealing a white waistcoat with a single line of buttons underneath) and long tails. After 1812, the French line infantry wore a flat fronted coat with a double row of buttons (plastron) and short tails. Only Airfix\'s French line infantry has the correct combination of flat front and short tails. Both ESCI\'s and Italeri\'s French line infantry have the inverted V fronts and short tails, a uniform that did not exist. Interestingly, the pictures and painting guides on the back of ESCI\'s and Italeri\'s boxes show the correct pre-1812 uniform.\nSome French light infantry (in blue breeches) had the V front and short tails, but they also had epaulettes, plumes and short gaiters.\nComments from visitor Peter Kogan:\nThose sets (ESCI and Italeri), plus the Airfix set, contain one other inaccuracy by portraying all of the infantrymen as wearing ""grands guetres"", or black gaiters reaching above the knee. Such gaiters were part of the French line infantry uniform prior to 1812 (together with the open-fronted habit), but were replaced at that time by shorter gaiters that were knee-length. Therefore, French line infantry in Russia, Germany in 1813 or Waterloo did not wear such gaiters. Incidentally, many French line infantrymen also wore overalls (wool or linen, depending on the season) over their gaiters, so an even more accurate picture would be to take an ESCI or Italieri torso and put it on the lower body of one of the ESCI or Revell grenadiers with pants.\nOne other peeve, of sorts, about the French line infantry sets is that, aside from the matter with the wrong coat, they will only accurately portray French infantrymen from a short time period: 1807-1812. Before that time, of course, French fusiliers wore bicornes and, after that time, the line infantry wore the closed-front habit vestes. Although shakos look better than hats, it\'s annoying to try to do a diorama showing the Austerlitz or Jena campaigs (not to mention earlier campaigns) by decapitating ESCI Prussians and giving their heads to French infantrymen.']"	['<urn:uuid:679b7534-9b50-43b1-bad0-a1ddac472d86>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	21	20	553
12	What are the climate characteristics of the taiga biome?	The taiga or boreal forest has a cold, harsh climate with temperatures below freezing for up to 6-month long winters. Summers are short, lasting 50-100 frost-free days, with temperatures sometimes exceeding 10°C. Annual precipitation is low, generally below 50cm, consisting of both snow in winter and rainfall in summer.	['Humid Mesothermal and Humid Microthermal Climate\nHumid Mesothermal Climate\nThis is the climate typical of the equator-ward parts of the temperate regions where the temperatures generally do not fall very low and they remain around 10 deg. C. This climate has three major sub types, the Mediterranean, the China type and the West European type.\nThe Mediterranean type of climate is characterized by a dry summer and humid winter. The summer temperatures are fairly high, i.e. around 25 deg. C. The typical vegetation of these regions is constituted by the plants which can withstand a long dry summer season and they have thick barks and long roots. Olives, grapevine and the citrus family fruits are the chief products of these regions and they are known for grain farming also. This type of climate occurs on the western margins of the continents in the latitudes between 30 and 45 deg. north and south latitudes. The areas around the Mediterranean Sea, central region of Chile, southern tip of South Africa and southwestern part of Australia are the chief regions of this climate.\nChina type of climate is characterized by warm summers and cool winters, the average temperature being around 19 deg. C. This type of climate is experienced in the eastern parts of the continents in the same latitudes in which the Mediterranean type of climate is found. The rainfall is available throughout the year and the major areas of this type of climate are in China, Argentina, south eastern part of USA and eastern coastal region of Australia.\nThe typical area of the west European type of climate is the coastal region of western Europe. This region extends between the 30 deg and 60 deg. latitude and includes western Europe, parts of North America, South America and south eastern coastal region of Australia. The summers are cool and the winters are cold here and the winter temperatures go below 10 deg. C. However, there is a distinct marine influence on the climate in these regions and the temperature even in winters remains slightly higher than the normal temperature of these latitudes. Rainfall occurs throughout the year but it is heavier in the winter season. Invasions of the cold polar air masses are common in these latitudes and temperate cyclones provide much of the precipitation.\nHumid Microthermal Climate\nThis climate is also known as the taiga type of climate, so named after the type of forests growing there. This type of climate is experienced in two large belts one each in North America and Eurasia. Most of the Siberian region and the high latitude areas of USA and Canada have this type of climate which has a cool summer and cold winter. The summer temperature sometimes goes higher than 10 deg. C. but the temperatures in the winter season go below the freezing point and remain so for eight months. The total annual precipitation is low, generally below 50 cm. but on account of the low temperatures this is enough to support the coniferous forests. These forests are the most important source of the softwoods and the fur bearing animals. Fur farming has now a days become one of the important activities, besides lumbering, in these regions.', 'What landforms are in the taiga?\nWhat is the taiga biome known for? The taiga biome is also known as coniferous forest or boreal forest. This biome typically has short, wet summers and long, cold winters. Precipitation is moderate in the taiga. It gets plenty of snow during the winter and plenty of rainfall during the summer.\nWhere is taiga found? The taiga is a forest of the cold, subarctic region. The subarctic is an area of the Northern Hemisphere that lies just south of the Arctic Circle. The taiga lies between the tundra to the north and temperate forests to the south. Alaska, Canada, Scandinavia, and Siberia have taigas.\nWhat do you mean by taiga? : a moist subarctic forest dominated by conifers (such as spruce and fir) that begins where the tundra ends.\nWhat landforms are in the taiga? – Related Questions\nWhat is another name for taiga?\nTaiga, also called boreal forest, biome (major life zone) of vegetation composed primarily of cone-bearing needle-leaved or scale-leaved evergreen trees, found in northern circumpolar forested regions characterized by long winters and moderate to high annual precipitation.\nDo humans live in the taiga biome?\nThere are also a few native communities of people who still live indigenously in the taiga. The major industries of the taiga include logging, mining, and hydroelectric development. Many large vertebrates who live in the taiga are sensitive to human presence, habitat alteration, and pollution.\nWhat is the climate of taiga?\nThe taiga is characterized by a cold, harsh climate, low rate of precipitation (snow and rain), and short growing season. Long, severe winters last up to 6 months, with average temperatures below freezing. Summers are short, lasting maybe 50 to 100 days without frost. Winters in the taiga are long and cold.\nAre there volcanoes in taiga?\nHigh plains cover most of the area with some mountain ranges dotted throughout. As glaciers receded, they also carved a plethora of lakes, rivers and streams into the vast open stretches that cover most of the taiga biome. Mountains exist in the Taiga biome too. Some of these mountains are dormant volcanoes.\nWhat is the hottest biome on Earth?\nDESERT BIOME • Deserts are the hottest and driest areas of the Earth. Temperatures reach 50˚C during the day, but fall below 0˚ at night.\nWhat are the 7 major types of biomes?\nThe world’s major land biomes include tropical rain forest, tropical dry forest, tropical savanna, desert, temperate grassland, temperate woodland and shrubland, temperate forest, northwestern coniferous forest, boreal forest, and tundra.\nWhat are 5 facts about the taiga biome?\nQuick Facts: –\nIn Taiga Biome, wildfires are very common. They are necessary to get rid of old and sick trees. The average annual rainfall in the boreal forest biome is approximately 33 inches. The dominant plant in the taiga is the coniferous evergreen tree.\nWhat are the two main seasons in taiga?\nTemperature. Taiga biome starts where the Tundra biome ends. The biome is, therefore, characterized by a lot of cold throughout most of the year. There are two major seasons, that is, winter and summer.\nWhat is the food chain in the taiga?\nVarious types of plants form the foundation of food chain in the taiga biome. The main trophic levels in the taiga biome food chain are producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, tertiary consumers and decomposers.\nWhat is the temperature range in the taiga?\nMean annual temperatures in the taiga range from a few degrees Celsius above freezing to −10 °C (14 °F) or more. Areas with a mean annual temperature below freezing are susceptible to the formation of permafrost soils (frozen ground; see below Soils).\nWhat forest is taiga?\nThe boreal forest, also known as the taiga, covers about 11% of the land mass of this planet. This makes it the world’s largest terrestrial biome! It is located in the northern hemisphere, approximately between the latitudes of 50° N – 65° N.\nWhat is the sentence of taiga?\nTaiga sentence example\nThe lowland ( taiga ) in the east comprises a plain with flat-topped hills covered by taiga vegetation with large open areas. They are chiefly hunters, passionately loving their taiga , or wild forests, and have maintained their Shaman religion and tribal organization into suoks.\nWhat animal live in the taiga?\nLiving in the Taiga\nThe insects attract a wide variety of species of birds to the forest like the spruce grouse and the pileated woodpecker. Mammals like pine marten, moose, bobcats, black bears, fishers, Canada lynx, and grizzly bears are found in the taiga.\nWhat percentage of trees are found in the taiga?\nThe Russian taiga accounts for 57 percent of world’s conifer forest and 23 percent of all the world’s woodlands. The Siberian taiga is larger than Amazonia.\nIs tundra colder than taiga?\nLooking at the temperatures, the tundra appears to be colder than the taiga. The taiga has trees, more flora and fauna while the tundra has no trees at all. It is just too cold for woody tress to grow.\nWhat is another name for the taiga quizlet?\nBoreal Forest Biome (Taiga)\nWhat is the opposite of taiga?\nThe word taiga typically refers to the biome characterized by moist coniferous forests found at high latitudes. However, one could loosely use dissimilar biomes as antonyms, e.g., desert.\nHow do humans use the taiga?\nHumans have a very large influence on the Taiga biome. The biome is rich in trees that are used for many different reasons, such as agri-business, industrial logging, Mining for metals, road building, and hydroelectric dams. Acid rain damages and harms the trees and the wildlife.\nIs the taiga in danger?\nCurrently, the taiga is experiencing threats from human activity that are creating many environmental issues.\nHow do animals adapt to taiga?\nMost animals migrate to warmer climates once the cold weather begins. Some animals have adapted to life in the taiga by hibernating when temperatures drop. Other animals have adapted to the extreme cold temperatures by producing a layer of insulating feathers or fur to protect them from the cold.\nHow do plants survive in the taiga?\nPlant Adaptations in the Taiga Biome\nNeedles will retain moisture and shed snow. The waxy coating on the tree needles prevents evaporation. The darkness of the needles helps to attract more sun. Many of the branches on evergreen trees droop down allowing the shedding of snow.']	['<urn:uuid:37306e95-c542-4a09-af3c-28ae00eac8fc>', '<urn:uuid:7751e742-c700-43da-bdee-70fc8b880796>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	9	49	1601
13	What exactly does a home inspector do during a house inspection, and is it something I need to get done when buying a house?	A home inspector is a generalist who performs a comprehensive evaluation of a home's condition and identifies safety concerns with the structure. While not typically required by banks, a home inspection is recommended. The inspector conducts a site visit examining the structure, roof, electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC, interior, exterior, and basic site work. They provide a written report of their findings. Buyers can choose to accompany the inspector during the inspection or meet at the end. The inspector's role is to provide an overall assessment of the visible components' basic condition, rather than to make recommendations about whether to buy the property or check for environmental concerns.	['The most common way to buy or sell a home is through realtors (also called an agent). The amount and who pays the realtors fee changes region to region, and country to country. Typically the realtors fee is split 50-50 between the buyer and sellers agent. Generally it’s the seller who pays the realtor’s fee, so sometimes sellers list and sell the property on their own. If this is the case, than it doesn’t cost a buyer to use a realtor, and there typically isn’t a contract established before hand, so if you don’t like your realtor you can leave.\nHowever if you use realtors to sell your home, than there is a contract that determines how long you have to stay with them, and how much you have to pay them. Generally the amount is 5-6%. There are a few agencies that take 4% but limit the amount of help they give you.\nThe problem with the lower fees is some buyers agents will not show clients property where there potential fee is limited to 1-2%. Realtors buy-in-large are worth the effort, since a good agent will increase the time and likelihood of your property selling, or you buying the right property.\nHow do I find a “good” realtor?\nRealtors can pretty much be found everywhere, but good ones are not. Remember it’s fairly easy to become a realtor and usually only need a few weeks or months of training. Here are four things to look for:\n1. Make sure they work full-time, and have been in the industry for a while. There are many who work part-time, have just started, or have jobs “on the side”. However, one must remember this, “if they were any good at what they do, they wouldn’t have to work at another job on the side”.\n2. Make sure the realtors you choose have experience and works with a reputable agency. It is important that the realtors and their company have experience in both the location (region) you want, and the kind (residential, multi-family, commercial) you want. It is also important to make sure the realtor, and agency is reputable. This can be done by calling the local realtors association, checking out the Better Business Bureau, Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, looking up references, and going online to research the current and past activities of the company.\n3. Make sure the realtors have in writing what they do for their clients. If the agent is too lazy to put things in writing, and only verbally tells you what they are going to do, than you had better find another realtor. Most realtors should at least make sure you are listed on some type of (MLS) Multiple Listing Service, LoopNet (more for multi-family and commercial properties), their own website, and various other online advertisements.\nThis ensures both realtors and people can find out the basic information about your property. The other things they should do is put up appropriate signage and informational boxes on the property, place advertisements in the local papers or magazines, put the property on local realtor drive-bys so other agents can see and show the property, open houses for the public, and place advertisements on free sites like Craigslist, bulletin boards, partner realtor sites etc.\n4 Make sure they are willing to list the selling or buying price at you are comfortable with. This does not mean that we can put any price on a property, and we should be willing to listen to the expertise of the person. Work with your realtor to determine what price you want the listing contract, or buying contract to be, and how much you are willing to negotiate. However in the end you have to live with the consequences and not them.\nI hear the term escrow all the time, what is escrow?\nHow do I know if the property is a good deal and what is an appraisal?\nA home inspection is not typically required by a bank or as part of escrow, but is a good idea. A home inspector is usually hired by the buyer to determine the overall condition of a home and to point out safety concerns with a structure (not environmental concerns). The inspector is a generalist (not code inspector) who performs a site visit, and then puts together a written report.A buyer can attend and walk along with the inspector, or come at the end if they choose. The inspection basically covers the structure, roof, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, interior, exterior and basic site work of the home.\nThey may or may not give recommendations, and most will not try to persuade you to buy or not buy the home. They are hired to basically provide overall assessment on the basic condition of the visible components on the home. A commercial building inspection is typically done on certain parts of a building that the potential buyer or seller is concerned with. Sometimes they include all the exterior, interior and site work. Other times they might include only the exterior, or roof, or electrical components. These may also include recommendations for repair, quotes on financial costs for repairs, potential safety concerns, conformance to various codes etc.\nMore articles on Buying a Home.']	['<urn:uuid:f8acd510-6603-4f17-a207-5b317cc925db>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	24	107	875
14	What role do physical skills play in specialized education and performance?	Physical skills are fundamental both in specialized performance contexts and educational curricula. For organ playing, this involves precise foot and ankle movements, keeping knees together, and maintaining proper posture on the bench. In educational settings, physical education and skills development are considered core curriculum components, offering opportunities to develop coordination, control, manipulation and movement abilities. Both contexts emphasize the importance of developing these skills gradually, promoting healthy lifestyles and contributing to physical development through practical experiences.	['Did you think your legs and feet were there just to keep you from falling off the bench?\nIt may surprise you how much undiscovered potential there is in those oft-neglected appendages!\n. . .\nAn Introduction to the Pedalboard\nthe organ’s most dreaded feature\n. . .\nAn organist plays the pedalboard with the heel and the toe of both feet. A good organ shoe is a basic tool of the organist.\nWhile playing in stocking feet may seem to be easier at first, the organ shoe offers many advantages. The sole minimizes the irregularity of the bottom of the foot. The heel of the shoe makes playing with heel of the foot less awkward. Additionally, playing intervals, such as a third or fourth, with one foot is a much easier task in organ shoes than in stocking feet. (Check out this fun video to see some great pedal technique.)\nIf you’re not ready to make the investment (about $50-60) in full-fledged organ shoes, you may want to look for some less expensive dance shoes that meet as many of the organ shoe characteristics as possible; with heel and sole characteristics being the most important.\nAnother option is to alter an existing pair of shoes. A shoe repair shop could add a heel, strap or a leather sole to make a pair of ordinary shoes suitable for organ use.\n. . .\nOn the Bench\nWhen preparing to play the organ, adjust the bench height so that your heels are at the same height as the pedals, with the feet roughly parallel to the keys. The feet should graze the white pedals as you move your feet around under the organ. You should have to lift your toes up off of the pedal board in order to reposition the feet, not stretch to press the foot pedals.\nAdjust the bench position forward or backward until both feet are just shy of the black pedals. Position yourself in the middle of the bench where you will remain seated while playing. Pivot your legs rather than sliding yourself along the bench.\n. . .\nPlaying the Foot Pedals\nEconomy of motion is the most important organ pedal technique, and using only slight movements will help you avoid wrong notes and missteps. During rests, reposition the feet and hold the toe over the next note to be played.\nPress the organ foot pedals with all of the toes, but don’t play with a flat foot. Keep the ankle flexible, like the wrist in keyboard technique, and roll the foot to the left or right to play the black organ foot pedals.\nPractice the foot position of different intervals until you get used to the motion of adjusting your feet and can judge where to place your foot based on the contact between your right heel and left arch. Practice both pressing and releasing notes cleanly, and keeping the feet from pressing any pedals unintentionally.\nKeep your knees together in all use of the pedals except where your feet must reach to the extremes of the pedalboard. Keep the ankle and knee in line, and allow the knees to move right and left to follow the foot and ankle, but do not let the knee bob up and down.\n. . .\nBuilding Your Skills\nOrgan techniques, like piano techniques, improve with practice. Finding a good organ teacher is ideal. If that is not a possibility for you, consider purchasing organ technique instruction materials.\nI highly recommend OrganTutor by Don Cook. It is an amazingly thorough and user-friendly computer-based resource for classical and traditional sacred organ instruction. and is available at ardpublications.com.\nAbove all, take time to build your skills starting with easier pieces and gradually moving to the more difficult. As you abilities grow, you’ll soon discover the organ is a creative, exciting challenge–not such a nasty beast after all!', 'School Curriculum- Aims, Approaches & Assessment\nWhat is the curriculum?\nThe curriculum is all the planned activities that we organise in order to promote learning and personal growth, development and independence. It includes not only the formal requirements of the National Curriculum taught in classrooms, but also any other activity organised by school, for example, educational visits and any other activities designed to enrich the experience of the children.\nWhat is our vision for how our outstanding curriculum will develop even further in the coming years?\n- Our curriculum will provide a strong element of ‘personalisation’, with a range of different pathways developed to enable each pupil over the long term to reach her/his own potential, whatever that might be.\n- The curriculum will have even stronger relevance for our pupils’ current and future lives.\n- The curriculum will continue to inspire a life-long love for learning.\n- Our broad and balanced curriculum will be highly effective in helping prepare children and young people for life in modern Britain.\n- The curriculum will be significantly enriched and brought vividly to life through a wide range of first-hand learning experiences beyond the classroom.\n- Pupils, where appropriate, will regularly express their needs and wishes in relation to the curricular pathway they follow.\nWhat do we strive to achieve for our pupils to become, as a result of our outstanding curriculum?\n- Successful learners who enjoy learning, make progress and achieve exceptionally well\n- Confident individuals who are able to get on well with each other and live safe, healthy and fulfilling lives\n- Respectful and responsible adults who are well prepared to play their part as law-abiding citizens in modern Britain, valuing equally different faiths and beliefs\nWhich are the most important aspects of children’s learning that underpin the content of our curriculum?\n- Communication skills\n- Personal, Social and Health Education, including healthy lifestyles\n- Physical skills\nWe provide a balanced, broadly based and relevant curriculum which promotes the spiritual, moral, social, cultural, mental and physical development of pupils, preparing them for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of later life.\nWhat is our overall approach to the organisation, planning and teaching of our curriculum?\nOur partnership with you\nBefore your child starts school, you will be invited to come and see the classroom, meet the teacher and senior members of staff in order to set up a partnership with you that will last throughout your child’s time at school. We place a high value on dialogue and exchange of information with parents/carers because knowing your expectations and priorities for your child is vital for us if we are to plan the best provision.\nThe ‘Big Picture’ for our curriculum\n- a specialist (local) curriculum is provided in the classes for sensory learners\n- thematic approach\n- accreditation and inclusion\n- priority areas\nIn room 10 the pupils follow a curriculum written by staff at Victoria School MSI Unit in Birmingham. There are four phases and eight Curriculum domains:\n- Social relationships and emotional development;\n- Conceptual development;\n- Sensory responses;\n- Understanding of time and place;\n- Orientation, movement and mobility;\n- Ownership of learning;\n- Responses to routines and changes\nThe class follows a termly theme with a focus on whole class, small group and individual work. On the timetable subjects may be identified but also activities such as Intensive Interaction, sensory stories, Rebound Therapy and individual programmes will also be evident.\nRoom 10 Example of 2 Year Curriculum\nIn this class there is an emphasis on multidisciplinary working with staff from Health and the Sensory Service supporting the pupil’s progress and wellbeing. Pupils are assessed using B Squared but also Routes for Learning or the MSI Profiles.\nKey Stage 3\nAt The Russett School we are following a thematic approach to teaching the National Curriculum as this enables pupils to link skills and knowledge taught across the theme. Pupils follow a three-year thematic rolling programme.\nWe continue to emphasise communication skills because they lie at the heart of teaching and learning. We adopt a ‘total communication approach’, drawing, for instance, on signing, Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), Voice Output Communication Aids (VOCAs) and objects of reference. This model enables a shared understanding between adult and learner, without which no true learning can take place.\nLearning activities are organised through schemes of work which are derived from the National Curriculum but adapted to suit the learning needs of the individual. Students are set challenging targets but there is a commitment to fun and enjoyment whilst learning. There are also increasing opportunities to participate in educational visits and extra-curricular activities, for examples in Key Stage 3, pupils may work towards environmental awards which allow more time for learning beyond the classroom.\nHow do we approach and what do pupils learn from different subjects in the curriculum?\n- English: Pupils access a wide range of texts from schemes such as Project X, Oxford Reading tree and Badger Learning Books. This gives a variety of fiction and non–fiction books helping to develop reading range. PM Benchmark is used as a reading assessment tool. Developing pupils’ ability to respond, to listen and to understand lies at the heart of our curriculum.\n- Mathematics: The teaching of mathematics enables pupils to use their awareness and developing understanding of pattern, space, shape and number, to develop problem-solving skills that contribute to making choices, taking decisions and gaining control over their immediate environment.\n- Science: The teaching of Science gives all pupils the opportunity to think and learn, and develop an interest in and curiosity about, the world around them. In particular, science offers pupils the opportunities to use their senses to explore and investigate, to develop an awareness of, and interest in, themselves and their immediate surroundings and environment. We also encourage pupils to participate in practical activities and develop an understanding of cause and effect.\n- Personal, Social and Health Education, including Citizenship and Careers Education: Learning PSHE and citizenship helps all pupils develop as individuals in a wider society. Pupils learn to understand themselves physically, emotionally, socially and sexually and understand their relationships with others. In particular, PSHE and citizenship offer pupils opportunities to make choices and decisions, develop personal autonomy by having a degree of responsibility and control over their lives. Careers is a vital part of the curriculum. From KS3 students are encouraged to think about the world of work and related skills, the curriculum is designed to develop knowledge, skills and learning useful in lifelong learning and work. Presentations from older students who have participated in work experience and talks from visitors give students the opportunity to consider options available. From Year 9 a member of staff from the Young People’s Service attends the annual person centred review meetings to help the student plan for the future and make the most of their life and career opportunities.\n- Religious Education (RE): Religion is the experience and expression of faith. Learning about religion and learning from religion are important for all pupils, as RE helps pupils develop an understanding of themselves and others. RE promotes the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of individuals and of groups and communities. In particular, RE offers pupils opportunities to develop their self- awareness, understand the world they live in as individuals and as members of groups, develop positive attitudes towards others, respecting their beliefs and experience, reflect on and consider their own values and those of others and deal with issues that form the basis for personal choices and behaviour.\nWe are very proud to have been awarded the RE Quality Mark twice- Gold standard.\n- Physical Education (PE): PE gives all pupils opportunities to develop their physical skills and to apply those skills in different situations. It also enables personal and group achievements to be acknowledged. In particular, PE offers pupils opportunities to develop their skills of coordination, control, manipulation and movement, promote a healthy lifestyle and contribute towards their physical development. PE also develops the personal qualities of commitment, fairness and enthusiasm.\n- Computing/Information Communication Technology (ICT): Developing capability in ICT helps all pupils become part of the rapidly changing world in which technology is an essential part. ICT helps pupils take greater responsibility for their own learning, plan and organise their ideas, and produce and present work of a high standard. It can also encourage creativity.\n- Humanities (Geography and History): Learning geography helps pupils develop curiosity in, and an understanding of, themselves, other people and places, and the relationships between them. Learning history helps pupils develop curiosity in, and an understanding of, the past and how their local community has changed. In particular, studying history offers pupils opportunities to develop knowledge and understanding of the sequences, routines and chronological patterns that make up their world.\n- Design and Technology (D&T): D&T provides practical learning experiences which make it accessible to all pupils. Pupils use knowledge and understanding from across the curriculum and apply and consolidate them in practical activities. Pupils carry out practical tasks in which they all can make a contribution to the development of individual or group projects.\n- Art and Design: Art and design stimulates creativity and imagination. It provides visual, tactile and sensory experiences, and is a unique way to understand and respond to the world, and to communicate with others. Pupils learn about the place and role of art, craft and design in life today, as well as in different times and cultures.\n- Music: Music is a powerful, unique form of communication that can change the way pupils feel, think and act. It brings together intellect and feeling and enables personal expression, reflection and emotional development. As an integral part of culture, past and present, it helps pupils understand themselves and relate to others and improves listening, concentration and attention skills.\n14-19, including Sixth Form\nAccredited courses, starting in Year 10, boost learning opportunities and raise achievements in a caring ethos which nurtures positive relationships and fosters the growth of responsible behaviour. All students will have the opportunity to:\n- achieve nationally recognised accreditation through ASDAN by gaining a diploma in ‘Life Skills’ and either an award, certificate or diploma in ‘Personal Progress’;\n- experience the workplace, receive impartial careers guidance and advice, voice their aspirations and work with staff, including our job coach, to achieve them;\n- receive travel training;\n- experience life in the community, e.g. visits to the local post office, library, shops and colleges\n- prepare for adulthood and independent living;\n- develop skills towards economic and personal and social well-being.\nIn the Sixth Form, we continue to deliver a curriculum linked to nationally accredited courses (ASDAN) which is tailored to students’ individual needs, interests and priorities. Our curriculum offers opportunities for our older students to develop their learning, functional and personal skills in real-life settings in school, the workplace and college placements, for instance. Students take responsibility for planning and making lunches, for running the school café and for acting as positive role models for younger students through our “Buddying” scheme.\nOur personalised progression pathways include college links, enabling students to gain real experience of, and be well-prepared for, life after school and make well-informed decisions about their future.\nOur Job Coach works with individuals and small groups to help students to identify and pursue their own career aspirations, offering real life experiences of the work place, an understanding of lifelong learning, and developing skills to enable students to contribute to society.\nHyperlinks to rolling programmes:\nWe use different methods and procedures to check that the curriculum is well-matched to pupils’ needs and achieving what it is designed to do. These include:\n- observations of teaching made by senior staff to see how well the curriculum is being taught and assess the impact that it is making on pupils’ learning and personal development;\n- work done by subject or curriculum leaders on reviews and audits, in order to identify future priorities for curriculum development;\n- analysis of pupil achievement data to check that the curriculum is promoting the best possible progress for learners;\n- questions asked by governors about the effectiveness of the curriculum and about the evidence that school leaders have of its impact on pupils’ learning and development;\n- feedback from parents/carers, so we can take account of their views on how well the curriculum is working.\nHow can I find out more about the The Russett’s curriculum?\nOther ways you might wish to use to find out more include:\n- Making an appointment to come into school to look at relevant documents, such as schemes of work\n- Making an appointment to come into school to talk to a senior member of staff.']	['<urn:uuid:984ec78e-a619-4ab8-b721-e29502e820a0>', '<urn:uuid:d9887aae-eb9e-455a-ba9a-56d0c426160e>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	11	76	2765
15	pond maintenance autumn winter tasks protect fish prevent algae growth	In autumn and winter, pond maintenance requires several key tasks. For fish protection, if the pond is less than 120cm deep, fish must be moved to an aquarium at 5-8 degrees Celsius in a bright, cool room. For deeper ponds, only exotic fish need removal. Install an artificial ice hole for fish air access. To prevent algae growth, remove excess leaves leaving only stringy threads for animal shelter, and avoid fertilizer runoff near the pond. You can use floating plants like lilies to shade the water, or apply pond dye to reduce sunlight penetration. Also monitor fish feeding - only provide what fish can eat within 30 minutes to prevent excess nutrients that fuel algae growth.	"['Autumn is a busy time in the garden – there is harvesting and preparing the garden for winter. What work needs to be done in autumn?\nAutumn: Harvest and cleaning time\nApples, plums, pears, and other fruits ripen in September. Some types of raspberries and strawberries can be harvested until the first frosts. Autumn is also the right time to harvest herbs. Walnuts ripen in October. If autumn is dry and sunny, you can also collect seeds from annual plants.\nIf pests or diseases have appeared on the plants, they should be eradicated immediately, using appropriate sprays. This can be done until the first frosts\nIn September, you should fertilize the lawn for the last time before winter. It is advisable to use a fertilizer containing phosphorus and potassium. These will strengthen the lawn and reduce the incidence of fungal diseases.\nRemove fallen leaves from the lawn regularly as they can lead to fungal diseases. Collected leaves can be put into a compost pile.\nAs long as the grass is growing, it should be mowed regularly. The grass should be cut to a height of 5 cm before winter. Shorter grass will be less resistant to cold. You should also aerate the lawn in autumn.\nAutumn is the right time to plant spring bulbs such as crocuses, tulips and hyacinths. Plant only healthy and undamaged bulbs, preferably in baskets. This way they will not be eaten by voles. In September, you can put into the ground perennial flowers that bloom in spring and summer.\nIn the autumn, remove potted houseplants from the garden and perennial plants which need to overwinter indoors. Evergreen plants can be safely left outside. Make new plantings in beds in early fall. Plants planted in the fall will root faster because they are not exposed to drought. In September, you can plant balled plants, heathers, and heathers into the ground.\nDo not forget to water the lawn and evergreens and conifers in autumn. This allows them to store a supply of water. If autumn is dry, water the plants until the soil freezes. The soil in the flowerbeds should be loosened and weeds removed.\nPruning shrubs and trees\nIf autumn pruning is necessary, it should be done in September while the leaves are still on. This way, only the branches that need to be cut will be removed. It is best to shred the cut branches and put them in the compost heap.\nIf you want your plants to overwinter safely in your garden, it is a good idea to protect them from excessive water loss. Mulching should be done on evergreen shrubs, thuyas and around perennials.\nAround shrubs and climbers you should make a mound 30-40 cm high. Small shrubs can be covered with airy material, e.g. fleece. Do not do this with evergreens. To prevent bark cracking on trees, bleach them. If you have ornamental grasses in your garden, tie them up and wrap them in airy material. It is also a good idea to bed them in.\nIf you have plants that overwinter in containers, protect the pots by covering them with, for example: Styrofoam. The layer must be quite thick. Throw overripe annuals into a compost heap and pour the soil from the pots into the flowerbeds. The pots should be washed, dried and stored until next season\nIf you have frost-sensitive plants in your pond, it is advisable to move them to an aquarium at home as early as September. These include: Water hyacinth, Carolinian azolla, crested water lily, and salvinia. The water temperature in the aquarium should be between 15 and 18 degrees.\nIf the pond has become excessively overgrown with plants, then they should be removed. Leaving 80-90% of the clean sheet. If the pond is less than 120 cm (20 in.) deep, the fish must be removed from it and transferred to an aquarium placed in a bright and cool room. Install a pump in the aquarium and keep the temperature at 5- 8 degrees. This way you won’t have to feed the fish; at temperatures below 10 degrees they fall into a state of numbness.\nIf the water tank is more than 120 cm deep, then exotic fish should be caught from it. It is worth removing dry leaves to leave only stringy threads, which will provide shelter for animals. Before winter, you need to install an artificial ice hole, e.g.: from Styrofoam. This way the fish will have access to fresh air. Remove water installations that may freeze. Clean them and store them in a dry room.\nProtecting gardening equipment\nIn late fall, it is a good idea to clean all digging and cutting tools and preserve them with the right product. You need to store them in a dry room. Turn off the water valve to the garden system and hide the garden hose. You need to clean the body and the blades on your lawn mower before winter. If you use a trimmer or a petrol scythe, do the same.\nmAIN PHOTO: Rob Sheahan/unsplash.com', ""Garden ponds and similar water features add visual interest, as well as the tranquil beauty of water plants, to any home landscape. They can also be used to attract birds while providing a habitat for colorful fish. Alas, the beauty of your backyard pond may become marred by algae, which turns the pond water an unattractive green. Keep your pond from going green by using proper pond management principles and, as a last resort, chemicals that kill algae blooms.\nKeep livestock and pets away from your pond by using fences, trellises, hedges or similar barriers. Animal manure contains nutrients that often provoke quick and severe algae growth in ponds.\nAvoid or minimize the use of plant fertilizer around your garden pond. For example, if you are growing a flowerbed adjacent to the pond, consider using bricks or wood berms to physically separate the soil from your pond's edge. Fertilizer runoff contains high levels of potassium, nitrogen and other nutrients that encourage algae blooms and turn pond water a green, murky color.\nShade your pond water. Sun exposure encourages the growth of pond weeds and green algae. Consider using floating plants, such as lilies, to help shield the water surface from the sun. Physical covers, such as a gazebo roof over the pond, can also help. A lower-maintenance option is pond dye, which darkens the water with dye pigments and helps reduce sunlight penetration into the water.\nMonitor how much fish food you use in your pond if you have fish such as carp or goldfish. Only apply as much fish food as they can eat within 30 minutes. If you notice food lying around the bottom of your garden pond after 30 minutes, use less fish food the next time you feed them. Overfeeding creates numerous problems. For example, excess food that's not eaten fuels algae and weed growth, and also physically contributes to murky water.\nApply an standard over-the-counter pond algaecide as a last resort to kill the algae and clear the water -- but note that green pond water problems will constantly return if you don't correct your pond maintenance strategies. For the best results, apply the algaecide once the pond water has reached an average temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.\nThings You Will Need\n- Fencing, hedge shrubs or similar obstructions\n- Bricks or wood berms\n- Floating pond plants\n- Aquatic pond dye\n- Pond algaecide\n- When choosing an algaecide, make sure it's labeled as fish-safe if you have fish in your backyard pond.\n- Algaecide can quickly kill algae and turn your pond water clear again. However, if you have problems like fertilizer runoff and fish overfeeding that continue, the green problems will return.\n- University of Rhode Island Landscape Horticulture Program: Water Gardens\n- University of Kentucky World Aquaculture: Managing Recreational Fish Ponds\n- Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service: Common Pond Problems\n- University of Vermont Extension: Algae in Farm Ponds\n- Kentucky State University Cooperative Extension Program: Use of Aquatic Dyes in Ponds\n- Clear Pond: General Maintenance\n- Ohio State University Extension: When to Apply Aquatic Herbicides\n- Ryan McVay/Photodisc/Getty Images""]"	['<urn:uuid:d3c0f58b-594b-402c-a43a-ae09abf26f4b>', '<urn:uuid:5d91bb26-4efd-45a0-9775-b280e0c3af60>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	10	116	1361
16	When to plan a river trip and what to do in emergencies?	The best time for river trips is between April and August, though trips are possible year-round depending on conditions. To avoid crowds, plan for non-weekend, non-holiday times. Water levels vary seasonally - spring brings higher flows, while August has lower levels with exposed rocks. If someone falls out of the raft, they should stay calm and let their life jacket bring them to the surface. They should float on their back with feet forward, try to hold the safety rope around the raft's exterior, and never attempt to stand in rapids. They should follow guide instructions and only swim to the raft if the current is weak.	"['Wallowa Wild and Scenic River\nBureau of Land Management, Oregon.\nIn keeping with Oregon and Washington State recommendations, a temporary Group Size Limit of 10 persons or less is in effect. Additionally, 6 foot social distancing must be maintained from other people who don\'t live in your household, including during travel to and from your destination.\nFederal public lands in the river corridor between Minam and the Snake River are open for dispersed recreation.\nSome Oregon and Washington State lands remain closed for overnight use, and are open for Day-Use only. Please contact the respective State for current information.\nRiver regulations still apply, and visitors are required to practice Leave No Trace to minimize impacts to the river resources.\nFor more river information, please call the BLM Baker Field Office at 541-523-1256.\nEach year, the Wallowa Wild and Scenic River receives thousands of visitors seeking the beauty and diverse recreation opportunities that the river offer. Where road and trail access is most limited, well-prepared whitewater boaters travel the river using a variety of specialized watercraft. A typical float trip begins at Minam on the Wallowa River and lasts two to three days, taking out on the Grande Ronde River downstream.\nPeak recreational boating season is between April and August, although river trips are possible throughout the year, depending on river conditions. Because the rivers are primarily free-flowing, water levels and river character changes dramatically with the seasons and local weather. Higher, faster river flows typically occur in the spring and early summer, as warmer temperatures and increased rainfall melt high mountain snows. As the season progresses, the river level gradually drops. By August, river flows are typically very low, with shallow water and exposed rocks being common. Low water levels usually remain throughout the fall and winter months. Boaters are strongly advised to obtain up-to-date river conditions and weather forecasts when planning their trip. Visitors wishing to avoid crowds should plan their trip to avoid weekends and holidays if possible.\nKnow Before You Go:\nEvery boating party must obtain a Self-Issue River Permit prior to launch, available at most public river access points. Permits are free, and do not restrict number of trips you make, or limit trip itineraries. Contact the BLM for more details-see contact information on sidebar.\nPrimitive, undeveloped river camping is available on a first-come, first-serve basis. Visitors are required to follow low impact, Leave-No-Trace practices to minimize the traces of their stay and help preserve the natural resources.\nVehicle shuttle routes often include rough roads, and may require good map reading skills and/or GPS to follow. Some roads may be unmaintained or impassable inquire locally for current conditions. Gasoline, food, and other services are often not available in rural areas. Cell phone service is generally not available in the remote, rugged terrain of the river corridor. Drivers should be well prepared, and carry extra fuel, food, water, and a spare tire.

Rafting involves risks and dangers, so one must follow the safety tips to gain a safe and an enjoyable rafting experience. Continue reading this article to know more about rafting, rafting safety tips, and ideas on what to do if you fall out of the raft while rafting.\nWhat is rafting?Rafting is a challenging and a risky competitive water sport in which the rafters have to navigate on river rapids using an inflated raft. It is generally a racing sport conducted in different formats with a set of rules in most of the countries around the world. Either a team or an individual can participate in the sport. The raft which reaches the finishing line first is declared as the winner. Rafting is conducted for both men and women of different age groups.\nWhitewater rafting or river rafting generally involves several levels of difficulty termed as 'grades' depending upon the degree of the rapids, size and type of the waves, the temperature of the water, remoteness and the dangers involved. Totally white water rafting includes 6 grades starting from Type 1(simple) to Type 6(very dangerous).\nRiver rafting is also considered as one of the popular recreational activities where the non-swimmers, non-rafters and even children can go for rafting and have fun after listening to the rafting instructions from the professionals or organizers. Before going for rafting, each and every individual will be provided with a life jacket, helmet, paddles, and rescue throw bags for safety. A raft can accommodate nearly 7 to 8 members, so the interested people can go as a team and gain fun-filled rafting experience.\nRafting safety tips- Do's and Don't sRafting involves some serious risks and environmental dangers such as undercut rocks, fallen trees on the way, heavy water flow, etc. Sometimes human behavior may also lead to a danger. So, before rafting one should have a basic knowledge of the safety tips and instructions on what to do and what not to do while rafting. Generally, a guide who knows rafting and first aid safety tips will accompany you while rafting.\nListed below are some of the rafting safety tips one must follow while rafting to avoid unnecessary risks and dangers caused by human activities.\nWhat to do while rafting\n- Wear a life jacket and buckle it properly. Make sure the jacket fits you perfectly. You can get the help of your guide while selecting a jacket.\n- Wear a helmet to protect yourself from getting hit on the rocks or from the paddles of the one sitting behind or in front of you in the raft.\n- Avoid wearing cotton clothes and most importantly try to wear a cloth that dries quickly.\n- Wear perfect and proper shoes that are recommended for rafting. It is a strict no to slippers, flip flops or bare feet.\n- Listen to your guide carefully and follow their instructions to keep yourself safe.\n- Without any hesitation, notify your guides in case of an emergency or medical conditions.\n- To protect yourself from sunburns, you can use sunscreen and sunglasses.\n- Follow the navigation commands of your river guide.\n- Paddle together with your companions by holding the paddle properly.\n- Leave all your valuables in a safe place on the land or any safety locker provided by the organizer.\nWhat not to do while rafting\n- Do not remove jacket and helmet in any situation.\n- Do not cross the safety line and strictly avoid keeping your feet outside the raft.\n- Do not tie any rope around your legs, waist, neck or arms.\n- Do not engage in any water fights or any other fun activities while rafting.\n- Do not jump or dive into the river from the raft without the permission of your guide because not all rapids are safe.\n- Do not stand up in the raft while rafting.\n- Avoid using your paddle as a splashing device or for any other fun activity.\n- Do not push and play with your companions in the raft because it may disrupt the balance of the raft.\n- Do not try to touch the rock or pull the branches from the trees while rafting.\n- Do not consume alcohol or drugs before rafting.\nWhat to do if you fall out of the raft while rafting?If you fall out of the raft while rafting, you should remember to follow several important things mentioned below to stay safe.\n- Stay calm. Do not panic. The rescue team will take necessary steps to help you.\n- As soon as you fall, your life jacket will bring you to the surface of the river. Just float on the river with your back and immediately extend your feet in front of you.\n- Try to hold the safety rope tied around the exterior of the raft to avoid moving far away from the raft.\n- Remember to hold the paddle tightly because the paddle is one powerful weapon through which you can get help by extending it to other rafters sitting in the raft.\n- If you are a swimmer and if you fall at a distance of one or two meters away from the raft, then you can swim to the raft if the river current is weaker. Never try to swim if the river current is stronger because you cannot swim in faster current and it may also lead to severe injury.\n- Do not try to stand in a rapid because chances are there for your foot to get caught in the rock or you may slip in the water.\n- Remember to follow the instructions of your guide. Swim in the direction where your guide points to.\n- If your guide throws a rescue throw bag at you, grab that carefully and put it over you as per the instructions provided.\nStrictly follow the safety tips and instructions to gain a safe and an enjoyable rafting experience.\nBe safe! Have fun! Create memories!""]"	['<urn:uuid:a5d06b9e-3dd6-4279-88d9-bd8c0c939e73>', '<urn:uuid:3a149a01-fd2d-4a31-bb52-604e550d50cd>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	12	107	1621
17	What basic amenities and climbing equipment are needed for tea house trekking?	For tea house amenities, you need sleeping bags, toilet paper, hand sanitizer, and earplugs since the walls are thin. For climbing equipment, you need trekking poles with cork grips for support, mountaineering boots for high altitudes, hiking boots with ankle support for lower elevations, and multiple pairs of trekking socks.	['Tea houses are accommodations along trekking routes in Nepal that offer basic lodging and meals. Many Sherpas in the Everest region own and operate tea houses along Everest’s trekking routes. To the west, the Annapurna region is protected in a vast conservation area managed by the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC). Tea houses in the Annapurna are monitored by the NTNC and must meet specific requirements including fixed pricing, standard menus, and limits on how many tea houses can be built along specific routes.\nIn lower elevations, tea houses may be multi-story concrete buildings with private rooms and attached western style bathrooms. The further you hike up, the more basic the accommodations get. The base camp may include a dorm-style shared room, boiling water (because it’s all frozen!), and a game of cards by solar light to conserve energy.\nDINING / COMMUNAL AREA\nEvery tea house has one large communal dining area with a wood-burning stove in the centre. It’s a great spot to meet other trekkers, swap stories, warm up, and sip tea while you watch the sunset over the mountains. Domestic tourism has skyrocketed in the past 6-7 years, and the growing number of Nepali trekkers coupled with an influx of international travellers can lead to overcrowding in the high seasons. At higher lodges, some travellers may sleep in the community room on extra cots or even tables if all the rooms are full.\nPRIVATE AND SHARED ROOMS\nMost tea houses more than a days walk from a town have a similar setup; two to three twin beds in every room, one overhead light (that works sometimes), a window and personal lock and key for your door. The beds are generally comfortable with a foam pad, pillow, and a blanket. We always ask travellers to bring a sleeping bag to ensure that you stay warm enough at night, and there is no guarantee of cleanliness when it comes to shared beds and sheets. A sleeping bag, or at least a liner in the warm months, is always a good idea. A solid pair of earplugs will also help ensure a good night’s sleep. We always try to reserve single rooms for travellers who request it. At times, the trail gets so crowded that trekkers may be asked by the tea house managers to share rooms to save space. While not ideal, it’s just a fact on the trail as tea houses are limited and everyone needs a place to sleep.\nTOILETS AND SHOWERS\nTea houses will either have western-style (sit down) toilets or the more traditional squat toilets found across Nepal. You never know which one you’re going to get, but the higher up you trek, it’s more likely to be the latter. Make sure to bring enough toilet paper for your entire trek and always have hand sanitizer nearby.\nAs for showers, they’re generally only available at the lower elevation tea houses and hot water is not always a guarantee. Wet wipes are your friend!\nELECTRICITY AND WI-FI\nMany of Nepal’s tea houses are run on solar power, providing a renewable and clean way to keep the lights on. Sometimes the power needs to be conserved, especially if it’s cloudy during the day, so expect for some power outages or afternoons where the lights won’t turn on until there’s enough energy to get everyone through the night. The electricity can also be disrupted by bad weather and wind.\nSome tea houses do have wifi for a small fee. Expect slow, dial-up-like speeds. Outlets are also available at the larger, concrete tea houses near towns, but just like the lights, may not always be running with electricity during the day. Expect limited to no power the higher up you go, although some tea house owners will let you use their power strip for $1-2/hr. If it’s a huge concern, bring an extra battery pack or small solar charger.\nFOOD AND DRINKS\nTea, tea, and more tea! The name isn’t misleading. Often the first thing you’ll be greeted with at a tea house is a warm cup of black tea with sugar. If you’re hiking in the rain, snow, or wind it’s the perfect way to relax.\nMeals are often cooked over a fire in the kitchen by the owners. While much of the food is delicious, especially the Nepali staples like momos and dal bhat, the quality of the Western-style dishes will vary greatly. Here’s a typical list of what you can expect to order in a tea house:\n- Tea, coffee, hot chocolate, & juice\n- Eggs any style\n- Ham/bacon/sausage (if available)\n- Toast with butter/jam/honey\n- Chapati, Tibetan bread, muesli porridge\n- Hash brown potatoes\nLUNCH & DINNER:\n- Pasta & noodles: chow mein, noodle soup, spaghetti, fried rice\n- Momos, dal bhat, pakauda\n- Popcorn, chips, potatoes\n- Spring rolls\n- Sandwiches & soup\n- Dessert (rice pudding, chocolate pudding, apple or banana fritters)\nTea houses are a unique part of your trekking experience in Nepal and add to the warm and inviting hospitality found throughout this amazing country. Here are a few extra tips for prepping for your tea house stay:\n- Have some extra rupees on hand to purchase candy bars, beer, or other snacks.\n- The plywood walls separating rooms are very thin – a good pair or two of earplugs can do wonders.\n- Fleece pants and comfy sandals are key for post-hike relaxation.\n- Portable solar lights can provide some extra light if the electricity goes out (or if you forget a headlamp).\n- Cards and books are a great way to pass the time, and don’t forget to play a friendly game of spoons with your guides! Just keep an eye on the spoons, until you realize, there is no spoon….\nLeave a Reply\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.', 'Last Updated on February 28, 2022 by Alpha Adventure Treks\nThe Himalayan mountains are not just for extreme mountaineers. Many of our guests are just outdoor enthusiasts who want to spice up their trip with a little excitement; many are also first-timers. In terms of difficulty, many of the trekking peaks (small to medium level summits) are not technical. They are climbed without the use of any additional oxygen. You will be able to enjoy the mountains more if you are in good physical condition and have a feeling of adventure. Anyone who can hike 5-8 hours per day for a couple of weeks, is not afraid of snow, and can follow our climbing guide’s very easy instructions, which include basic rope skills, proper equipment wear, and use, is qualified for small range (trekking peak) climbing trips. Climbing experience on lesser peaks, basic training, and an awareness of technical climbing issues are all required for large-scale mountaineering\nWhat Should You Bring for Peak Climbing in Nepal?\nPacking for a trip can be a difficult chore. Sometimes you bring more than you need, and other times you forget even your most important belongings.\nIn any case, packing chaos is something we all go through before heading on our journeys. Whether it’s a pleasant trip to the sun-kissed beaches or an adventurous excursion to the mountains, we can get lost in the details of what to carry in our rucksack.\nThe greatest method to keep this turmoil to a minimum is to stay informed on the journey you’re about to go on. Forgetting stuff on a regular vacation isn’t a big concern, but not having your needs during extreme experiences like peak climbing in Nepal can be disastrous.\nConsider not wearing your Gore-Tex pants on the summit night of your Mera Peak expedition, or neglecting the bandana and getting a Khumbu cough.\nAfter all, you can’t afford to be sick and lose out on the thrill of the adventure. Similarly, carrying too much weight on your climb might detract from your enjoyment as well as your safety by slowing you down.\nWhile your journey to Annapurna Circuit will be strenuous, it makes no sense to add extra weight to your bag with items you won’t use. Choosing your packing list for your Nepalese peak climbing trip is not an easy task.\n“Going light” has gotten a lot of attention. However, how light does “going light” have to be? This is the packing list for your Nepal mountaineering trip:\nClimbing in Nepal Packing List:\nFor starters, you’ll need a suitable travel bag for your excursion. You can carry your items in either a medium rucksack or a large duffel bag.\nYou’ll also need a daypack or backpack with a capacity of 35 to 50 liters to carry your essentials along the trip.\nThis backpack should feature adequate hip weight straps so that the weight of the bag is carried on your waist rather than your shoulders.\nPoles for trekking:\nMountaineering in Nepal necessitates the use of good trekking poles.\nYou’ll be walking over a variety of terrains on your excursion, and these poles will give support for your legs.\nThe poles are most useful during your descent since they allow you to put less pressure on your knees by supporting you.\nOne set of trekking poles with cork grips can be carried.\nYou’ll need mountaineering boots to get to the top. To protect your feet from frostbite, these boots must be light and warm.\nMake sure you get the proper size and that you can walk comfortably with it on.\nHiking boots are recommended for use on the trail’s lower elevations.\nChoose hiking boots with strong soles and ankle support.\nThese boots assist you in maintaining your balance while crossing Nepal’s various terrains.\nWhen climbing in Nepal, it’s essential to have the right socks. A variety of trekking socks are required as you travel from warm to cold weather and back to warm temperatures.\nYou can wear a combination of liner, light, and thick socks. Two pairs of thin socks and two pairs of thick socks are required at a minimum.\nKeep a new pair of socks on hand to change into when you arrive at the camp or tea houses.\nThe Basic Layer (for top and bottom):\nThe purpose of the basic layer is to keep you warm in chilly weather.\nYou can wear them under your Gore-Tex leggings and tops while sleeping in the camps or even on summit night.\nIt is preferable to wear a base layer (top) with a hood.\nPants and shirts made of Gore-Tex:\nOn the summit night, Gore-Tex shirts and pants are essential. You can keep them in your backpack and pull them out whenever you need them.\nThey are really useful on wet days.\nShorts for hiking/pants for hiking:\nIn the lower parts, trekking pants and shorts are required.\nYou can bring one pair of hiking shorts and one pair of trekking pants, or two pairs of trekking pants (one with a cut off which can be turned into shorts, if needed).\nThese trekking pants need to be light, washable, and quick to dry.\nIn the camp, you’ll need fleece pants to remain warm. You can change into comfy fleece pants once you arrive at the camp.\nThey can be worn when walking the lodges and tents, as well as while sleeping.\nFor the lower regions, you can bring 2–3 regular t-shirts to wear while trekking. These T-shirts can be washed on the trail.\nYou are free to wear whichever underpants you like. It is recommended that you bring enough undergarments, or at least a few, and wash the used ones along the route.\nKeep an extra plastic bag on hand to keep your used outfits. It’s not a good idea to mix old and new garments.\nDown or synthetic vest:\nYou have the option of wearing a synthetic or down vest. In the lower areas of the trail, you can use them to get to the base camp.\nThis vest keeps you warm and protects you from the Himalayan region’s frosty wind.\nThe purpose of a fleece jacket is to keep you warm in the chilly alpine weather. It can be carried in your bag and used while staying in tents, hotels, or even while sleeping. It’s best to wear a hooded fleece jacket.\nYour down jacket is another essential item to carry with you on your Nepal expedition.\nThe down jacket is lightweight and keeps you warm. They are very low in weight and can be packed into a small bag.\nA hooded down-jacket of decent quality is required.\nFor the Head:\nBandanas are huge, multicolored kerchiefs that can be used as a headband, handkerchief, neckerchief, bikini, or sweatband. You inhale chilly, dry air while in Nepal’s mountainous regions.\nA multi-functional bandana will keep your neck warm while also aiding in the retention of moisture in your mouth.\nThis will keep you safe from the deadly Khumbu Cough. They also keep you safe from the dust on the trails. It can also be worn as a hat.\nWe recommend that you bring a thin bandana and a fleece-lined bandana for use at higher elevations.\nSun hat and Sun Glasses:\nThe sun hat (also known as a baseball hat) keeps the sun off your ears and neck, preventing sunburns. Sunglasses with UV protection, on the other hand, protect your eyes from the sun.\nFleece lined hats:\nIn the chilly mornings and evenings, a fleece lined hat keeps your head warm. You can wear them while strolling around the lodges and tents at night.\nYou can also wear them below your helmet when climbing.\nFor the Hands:\nClimbing requires the use of gloves. They keep your hands nice and toasty. You can bring a pair of lighter gloves and a pair of thicker gloves with you.\nBoth gloves should make it easy for you to move your hands. Because climbing necessitates constant hand movement with ropes and equipment, a glove with a solid grip is required.\nDuring your Nepal expedition, bring a 2-inch-thick air mattress.\nEven though the mattress will take up room in your bag, adequate sleep is essential after spending longer time on the trails.\nIn most situations, sleeping bags with a temperature range of 30 to 50 degrees work properly.\nIt also strikes a balance between the sleeping bag’s weight and the amount of warmth required.\nYou can also bring a fleece sleeping bag liner with you, which will keep you nice and warm even on the coldest of nights.\nAside from the equipment listed above, there are a few extra add-ons that may be required for a Nepal adventure.\n- Extra plastic bags\n- Water bottles (min 2)\n- Head torch\n- Hand Sanitizer\n- Spare batteries\n- Journal and pen (if needed)\n- Toiletries (tissues, soaps, etc)\n- Trail map\n- Medical Kit (water purifying tablets, Diamox, etc)\n- Lightweight pillowcase\n- Power bank with solar panels\n- Travel game (cards, chess, board games, etc)\nFAQs: about Peak Climbing in Nepal\nThe best season for climbing the mountains in Nepal is April, May and October. In general climbing Himalayas is better in Spring season than on Autumn.\nThere are some 326 peaks where climbing is allowed by the Mountaineering Section of the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation in Nepal.\nThe Easiest Mountain to climb in Nepal is Pokalde Peak as it’s the shortest at the summit height of 5,806 M.\nThere is no such peaks considered as the easiest because even the easiest peak might get tougher considering the physical fitness and weather. You should be prepared to brace yourself.\nIt is very likely to get altitude sickness during the trek, it is why we have guides who are experienced and equipped with basic medical kit required for the treatment. If the illness is not cured with the basic treatment, then the person will immediately be airlifted back to Kathmandu for the further treatment.\nYes there is accessibility of telephone on the way to the Peak but it is very likely to get disconnected depending on the geographic and signal strength.\nGenerally, we walk around 5-6 hours on an average depending on the altitude we are at. If we are at the higher altitude, we don’t walk fast and long. We scientifically design our itinerary and hours of walk, as per gaining of altitude.\nThree-time meal with high in protein, vitamin and fiber is provided during the climbing. Staying energetic and hydrated is very important while on the Himalayas. It is mandatory to eat around 8000-10000 calories a day during climbing.\nBelow are few important equipment needed for climbing:\n• Quick draws\n• Down-turned, High-Performance Climbing Shoes\n• A Sport Harness\n• The Right Rope\n• An Assisted Braking Belay Device\n• A Chalk Bag and chalk\n• A Helmet\n• A Crag Bag or Rope Bag\nThere are many climbing equipment needed while peak climbing in Nepal and all such equipment’s are managed by the agency themselves and is included in package.\nClimbing an extreme altitude without a guide/porter is highly risky. You might not be alone there but easily could be so we recommend a guide and porter for your safety.\nDrinking water shortages have been a long-standing problem across the country. River or stream water are the most common sources of drinking water in the highlands, however we do not recommend them to our clients. During your journey, the water could be highly contaminated, causing a variety of ailments. Drinking water will be provided in the teahouses during the journey up to the base camp, either from taps, boiling water, or bottled water. We also recommend using steriPEN or other water\npurification solutions. Water is scarce during peak climbing season, therefore it must be carried all the way to the summit. We will provide bottled water or boiled and sterilized water to our customers to\nreplenish their water bottles or bladders.\nYou will be staying in teahouses or lodges at the end of each trekking day from Lukla to Chhukung.\nAs a result, for a modest fee, you will be able to charge your electronic gadgets here. However, as you\nleave Chhukung and return to Pangboche via Island Peak, we shall rely on solar chargers as long as the\ndays are sunny; otherwise, charging your smartphone would be impossible. Extra batteries and power\nbanks are recommended.\nThere are many Teahouses in the base camp where you will spend your night during the peak climbing. In some cases, we also set up a camp for you to stay the night where teahouses aren’t available.\nFEEL FREE TO CONTACT US']	['<urn:uuid:29d47280-bb2d-4706-8500-57f386bcc709>', '<urn:uuid:9f9278c4-53de-4a9c-9f62-5527c2fe2e09>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	12	50	3089
18	experienced boater safety gear preparation bad weather steps track weather updates	To prepare for bad weather, you should equip your boat with PFDs (Personal Flotation Devices) and foul weather gear for all crew members, secure all hatches, ports and windows, and ensure emergency equipment like hand pumps and bailers are ready. For weather tracking, you should continuously monitor VHF radio channel 16 for updates and use NOAA weather radio, which provides detailed forecasts and warnings within 20-40 miles range. For longer distances, an HF single sideband transceiver is recommended.	"['Boating in Heavy Weather - Part I\nPreparation For Heavy Weather\nThis week\'s tip is all about preparing yourself for heavy weather. If you have kept a proper lookout, developed a ""weather eye"" and monitored the weather on your VHF radio, you should have plenty of time to get prepared. Obviously, the best way to handle rough weather is to get to shore immediately and avoid it completely. However, this may not be practical if you are on an extended cruise. In this case, you should prepare yourself, the vessel and your crew for what is to come.\nAs boats vary in design and size, and weather conditions vary in severity, so does the laundry list of precautionary items that need to be performed. The following list was accumulated from various resources and from input from those who answered last week\'s question concerning ""what to do if heavy weather is approaching."" Thanks to those who contributed. For novice boaters we have defined some of the, perhaps, unfamiliar terms such as jack line, sea anchor and drogue below.\nWhat Every Skipper Should Know\n- Meet with the crew to explain the situation and reassure them. Make sure that they know what to do, and what not to do, when the extreme weather arrives. Explain such things as keeping low in the boat, not moving around excessively and not going out on deck unless necessary. Give them all an assignment to keep them occupied and keep their minds off the situation.\n- Determine position of storm, wind direction, speed and estimate time to your location.\n- Secure all hatches; close all ports and windows. (Keep the water on the outside.)\n- Pump bilges dry and repeat as required. This helps eliminate ""free water affect."" (Sloshing of water in the bilge as the boat rolls which can effect stability.)\n- Secure all loose gear above decks and below. Put away small items and lash down larger ones. Anything you want to have when the storm passes must be secured.\n- Break out PFD\'s and foul weather gear and exercise your authority as skipper by requiring them to be worn by everyone on board. Do this before the weather gets bad, don\'t wait too long.\n- Ready emergency equipment that you may need such as hand pumps, bailers, first aide kit, sound signaling device, etc.\n- Get a good fix of your position and plot it on your chart. Make note of the time, your heading and speed.\n- Make plans to alter course to sheltered waters if possible.\n- Continue to monitor channel 16 on your VHF radio for updates to severe forecasts.\n- For extremely severe weather, break out your abandon ship procedures and review them.\n- Make sure the life raft is ready to be deployed.\n- Make sure emergency food and water are in the life raft.\n- Rig jack lines (see below for definitions) and/or life lines and require anyone who must go on deck to wear a safety harness.\n- Make ready your sea anchor or drogue if needed.\n- Turn on navigation lights.\n- Keep away from metal objects.\n- Change to a full fuel tank if possible.\n- Keep a sharp lookout for floating debris and other boats.\n- If you have a choice, do not operate the boat from the flybridge.\nPrevent getting caught in heavy weather by developing a ""weather eye,"" listening to your radio, and heading for shore before it becomes an emergency.\nJack Lines - lines rigged along the outboard decks running from the bow aft. This allows you to attach the tether from your safety harness and move forward and back at will.\nLife Lines - usually vinyl or plastic covered wire rope at the sides of the boat\'s deck to keep the crew from falling overboard.\nSafety Harness - a nylon web harness worn in rough seas or heavy weather. It has a tether with a clip. The clip is attached to the jack lines or lifelines so that if you are washed overboard in a storm you are still attached to the boat.\nSea Anchor - A floating canvas cone, held open by wire rings, with an opening in the smaller end, and a rope bridle at the larger end attached to a line leading to the bow of the boat. It is used in storm conditions to (a) keep the bow of the boat into the wind, and (b) slow the downwind drift of the boat.\nDrogue - Any device steamed astern to check a boat\'s speed and/or to help keep the stern perpendicular to the waves in a following sea.', '- Special Sections\n- Public Notices\nRick Morgan, Owen County emergency management director, asks that you should know the weather which can be both friend and foe.\nCalm winds and water make for enjoyable power boating, waterskiing, and fishing.\nA fresh breeze and a light chop provide an invigorating sailing or wind-surfing experience. But the sudden emergence of dark clouds, shifting and gusty winds, torrential downpours and lightning can turn a day’s pleasure into a nightmare of distress.\nHere are some tips on how to keep your pleasure and safety to a maximum.\nIf you plan for a day of boating fun, look at the weather reports several days ahead of time. Start listening for the National Weather Service extended five-day outlooks on NOAA weather radio, radio and TV.\nThe outlooks give general information to help you decide whether or not to continue making plans.\nBefore you set out, pay close attention to the TV weathercast and listen to detailed weather forecasts on NOAA weather radio.\nTake note of small boat cautionary statements, small-craft advisories, or gale or storm warnings in the forecasts.\nThe advisories and warnings alert mariners to higher winds and waves either occurring now or forecast to occur up to 24 hours from now.\nAdvisories and warnings for conditions expected later give mariners time to take action to protect life and property.\nAfter you set out, don’t touch that dial. Stay tuned to NOAA weather radio.\nYou know the weather and it will change. The change often occurs out of your sight and may be headed your way.\nUpdated warnings and forecasts are aired immediately on NOAA weather radio, alerting you to changes that may require action on your part.\nWhile on the water, stay alert. Check NOAA weather radio for latest warnings and forecasts.\nWatch for signs of approaching storms: dark, threatening clouds that may foretell a squall or thunderstorm, a steady increase in wind or sea, lightning flashes.\nAn increase in wind opposite in direction to a strong tidal current may lead to steep waves capable of broaching a boat. Heavy static on your AM radio may be an indication of nearby thunderstorm activity.\nIf a thunderstorm is approaching, head for shore if possible. Get out of your boat and away from the water and find shelter immediately. If a thunderstorm catches you while afloat, remember that gusty winds and lightning pose a threat to safety.\nPut on your personal flotation device and prepare for rough water. Stay below deck if possible.\nKeep away from metal objects that are not grounded to the boat’s protection system. Don’t touch more than one grounded object at the same time (or you may become a shortcut for electrical surges passing through the protection system).\nIf you have a VHF transceiver with built-in NOAA weather radio channels, use them.\nIf your VHF radio is not equipped with weather channels, you may want to buy a VHF weather radio. Keep in mind, however, broadcast reception varies with the location of you and the transmitter, the quality of the radio, and any obstructions. A broad, average range is 20 to 40 miles.\nIf you venture beyond that range, you should consider buying a good quality HF single sideband transceiver to add to your VHF. It may be more expensive, but it is worth it to be able to get the information that may save your life and property.\nHave fun and be safe on Kentucky waterways.']"	['<urn:uuid:b1f61075-5a19-4eee-a7cd-965ce764a1b5>', '<urn:uuid:efff973a-f7ec-4679-b7ff-d56109973628>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	11	78	1348
19	Are ancient Ethiopian and Irish religious books similar in art style?	While both manuscripts feature rich illustrations, they show distinct styles. The Garima Gospels contain vivid illustrations typical of early Byzantine style, including depictions of the Jewish Temple and over twenty different birds. The Book of Kells features characteristically Irish art elements like closely coiled spirals, zoomorphic interlacements, geometric ribbon weaving, and intricate initials with multiple colors including sienna, purple, lilac, red, pink, green, and yellow. The Book of Kells notably contains no silver or gold, while showing extremely detailed ornaments with up to 158 interlacings in a one-inch square space.	"['Radiocarbon testing has revealed that a pair of illustrated gospels kept in a remote monastery in Ethiopia may have been made as early as the 4th century and are perhaps the oldest surviving illustrated Christian works in existence. The Garima Gospels were first reported on in the 1950s, but it has only been within the last couple of years that scholars have been able to examine the work and help conserve it.\nIn 2006 the British-based Ethiopian Heritage Fund began a project to examine the Garima Gospels, which have been kept at the Monastery of Abba Garima in northern Ethiopia for hundreds of years. Scholars were allowed to take two parchment fragments from the manuscripts, and testing at Oxford University revealed that they date back to somewhere between 330 and 650 AD. It had previously been believed that the texts were no older than the twelfth century. According to legend, the manuscripts were brought to Ethiopia from Constantinople by Abba Garima in the year 494.\nJacques Mercier, a French specialist in Ethiopian art, believes that the manuscripts may have been created around 600. Both of them contain several pages of vivid illustrations typical of early Byzantine style, which include a depiction of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, a portrait of Saint Luke, and images of over twenty different birds.\nMichelle Brown, a former British Library curator, tells the Art Newspaper that, “the Garima Gospels case vital light upon early Christian illuminated manuscript production and upon the role of sub-Saharan Africa…It is the sort of model the inspired such vibrant later Ethiopic art and is an important witness to the way in which the churches of the Christian Orient both absorbed the courtly Christian culture of Constantinople and developed their own voices and styles.”\nThe texts also received some conservation work, which was done in the monastery, as the texts were not allowed to leave its premises. Blair Priday of the Ethiopian Heritage Fund explained to the Daily Mail, “all the work on the texts was done in situ and everything is reversible, so if in future they can be taken away for further conservation we won’t have hindered that. The pages had been crudely stitched together in a restoration in the 1960s and some of the pages wouldn’t even turn. And they were falling to pieces. The Garima Gospels have been kept high and dry which has helped preserve them all these years and they are kept in the dark so the colours look fresh.”\nThe Ethiopian Heritage Fund was established in 2005 to undertake conservation of manuscripts and paintings in churches. They have worked on other medieval treasures, including two 15th century paintings of St. Mary. Priday added: ‘Ethiopia has been overlooked as a source of these fantastic things. Many of these old Christian relics can only be reached by hiking and climbing to remote monasteries as roads are limited in these mountainous regions.”\nWant more medieval? Take a look at our digital magazine – The Medievalverse – Click here to see our latest issues', 'An Irish manuscript containing the Four Gospels, a fragment of Hebrew names, and the Eusebian canons, known also as the ""Book of Columba"", probably because it was written in the monastery of Iona to honour the saint. It is likely that it is to this book that the entry in the ""Annals of Ulster"" under the year 1006 refers, recording that in that year the ""Gospel of Columba"" was stolen. According to tradition, the book is a relic from the time of Columba (d. 597) and even the work of his hands, but, on palæographic grounds and judging by the character of the ornamentation, this tradition cannot be sustained, and the date of the composition of the book can hardly be placed earlier than the end of the seventh or beginning of the eighth century. This must be the book which the Welshman, Geraldus Cambrensis, saw at Kildare in the last quarter of the twelfth century and which he describes in glowing terms (Topogr. Hibern., II, xxxviii). We next hear of it at the cathedral of Kells (Irish Cenannus) in Meath, a foundation of Columba\'s, where it remained for a long time, or until the year 1541. In the seventeenth century Archbishop Ussher presented it to Trinity College, Dublin, where it is the most precious manuscript (A. I. 6) in the college library and by far the choicest relic of Irish art that has been preserved. In it is to be found every variety of design typical of Irish art at its best.\nSome small portions at the beginning and end of the manuscript have been lost, but otherwise it is in a very good state of preservation. It was apparently left unfinished, since some of the ornaments remain only in outline. It is written in part black, red, purple or yellow ink, and it has been thought that the hands of two scribes, neither of whom is known to us by name, are discernible in the writing and illumination of the manuscript. The most characteristic ornaments of the Book of Kells, as of other illuminated Irish manuscripts of the period, are the closely coiled spirals connected with each other by a number of curves and terminating in the so-called ""trumpet pattern"". Almost equally characteristic are the zoomorphic interlacements, coloured representations of fanciful beings, or of men, animals, birds, horses, dogs, and grotesque, gargoyle-like human figures, twisted and hooked together in intricate detail. Other frequently occurring designs are a system of geometrical weaving of ribbons plaited and knotted together, and a simpler ornamentation by means of red dotted lines. The versatility and inventive genius of the illustrator surpasses all belief. Lines diverge and converge in endless succession, and the most intricate figures, in lavish abundance and with astounding variety of ornament, are combined and woven into one harmonious design. In spite of the extent of the work and its thousands of exquisite initials and terminals, there is not a single pattern or combination that can be said to be a copy of another. The artist shows a wonderful technique in designing and combining various emblems, the cross, vine, dragon, fish, and serpent. The drawing is perfection itself. It has been examined under a powerful magnifying glass for hours at a time and found to be, even in the most minute and complicated figures, without a single false or irregular line. Some of the most accomplished of modern draughtsmen have attempted to copy its elaborate designs, but, such is the delicacy of the execution, that they had to abandon the task as hopeless. In a space of one inch square were counted no less than 158 interlacings of white ribbon with a black border on either side. On the other hand, the pictures of the personages delineated are feeble and primitive and show but a limited knowledge of the human figure and its relative proportions.\nNo words can describe the beauty and the extreme splendour of the richly coloured initial letters, which are more profuse in the ""Book of Kells"" than in any other manuscript. The only thing to which they can be compared is a bed of many coloured crocuses and tulips or the very finest stained glass window, which they equal in beauty of colouring and rival in delicacy of ornament and drawing. The artist possessed a wonderful knowledge of the proportion of colour and the distribution of his material -- sienna, purple, lilac, red, pink, green, yellow, the colours most often used -- and he managed the shading and tinting of the letters with consummate taste and skill. It is remarkable that there is no trace of the use of silver or gold on the vellum. Sometimes the colours are laid on in thick layers to give the appearance of enamel, and are here and there as bright and soft and lustrous as when put on fresh more than twelve hundred years ago. Even the best photographic and colour reproductions give but a faint idea of the beauty of the original. Especially worthy of notice is the series of illuminated miniatures, including pictorial representations of the Evangelists and their symbols, the Blessed Virgin and the Divine Child, the temptation of Jesus, and Jesus seized by the Jews. These pictures reach their culminating point in what is, in some respects, the most marvellous example of workmanship that the world has ever produced, namely the full page monogram XPI which occurs in the text of the Gospel of St. Matthew . It is no wonder that it was for a long time believed that the ""Book of Kells"" could have been written only by angels.\nBiography Of St Brendan\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia is the most comprehensive resource on Catholic teaching, history, and information ever gathered in all of human history.

20	senior citizen age 70 risks complications from flu and shingles what should know	For people over 65, both flu and shingles pose significant health risks. The CDC estimates that 71-85% of flu-related deaths and 54-70% of flu-related hospitalizations occur in people 65 and older. For those above 65, there's a special high-dose flu shot (Fluzone High-dose) that's four times stronger than regular flu shots and 24.2% more effective. Regarding shingles, age is the most relevant risk factor, with half of all cases occurring in people 60 or older. Getting medical attention is especially critical for people over 70 with shingles symptoms, as untreated shingles can lead to severe complications including serious nerve damage, pain lasting months to years, vision loss, and neurological problems.	['What are shingles?\nShingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a viral infection that affects approximately one third of Americans. The virus typically causes an itchy or painful skin rash of small, fluid-filled blisters. Eventually, the blisters dry out, form a crust, and sometimes leave behind scars. Interestingly, shingles is caused by a re-activation (or “awakening”) of the varicella-zoster virus in the body, the same virus that causes the chickenpox (more on that later). The condition is very contagious and can spread through direct physical contact with open sores or blisters, not just to other parts of the affected person’s body, but to those around them who’ve never been vaccinated or have never been exposed to the virus. It’s highly recommended that anyone who suspects they may have shingles to seek medical attention as soon as possible, as the condition can result in serious health issues if left untreated. Thankfully, only one out of three people with shingles might experience complications or severe symptoms, including nerve pain.\nSo, what’s the difference between shingles and chickenpox if they’re caused by the same virus? Usually, most varicella-zoster viral particles are destroyed by a person’s immune system following a chickenpox infection. For most people in the U.S. this happens in childhood. However, some of these particles can remain dormant (or inactive) in the body for years, re-activating later on in life to cause a shingles outbreak during a time of weakened immunity. This is why shingles outbreaks are more likely to occur among individuals with chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems, people taking immunosuppressive drugs, and those over the age of 50. In fact, half of all shingles cases occur in people 60 years of age or older as age is the most relevant risk factor for developing shingles. While multiple outbreaks of shingles are fairly rare, the risk of recurrence is higher in immunocompromised individuals.\nKnowing what to look out for can not only help folks seek treatment early, but it can also prevent transmission to others. Symptoms of shingles may include:\n- Red, itchy rash with fluid-filled blisters, often on one side of the abdomen or near an eye\n- Pain, tingling, burning, and itchiness at infected sites of the skin, sometimes one to five days before the appearance of a rash\n- Fever or chills\n- General achiness, fatigue, headache, and upset stomach\nA shingles outbreak typically lasts about seven to ten days then blisters start to scab over. It may take another two to four weeks for the skin to clear completely — at this point, the person is no longer actively contagious. It’s worth noting that symptoms and the degree to which they’re experienced may vary between individuals. For example, some folks with shingles might experience pain without the rash, or vice versa. Left untreated, however, shingles can lead to severe complications, including serious nerve damage and pain that can last for months to years, as well as vision loss, neurological problems, and additional skin infections. Thus, if there’s a suspicion that shingles may be the culprit for a given set of symptoms, getting it checked out is wise. With this in mind, it has been noted that getting medical attention is especially critical for those people over the age of 70 concerned that they may have shingles or those who have characteristic symptoms that appear to be affecting the eye or areas of the face near the eye. Confirmation of a shingles diagnosis is only possible by assessing a person’s symptoms and ordering laboratory testing. Treatment started as soon as possible is recommended for best results and may include pain relievers (analgesics) and medicated creams to reduce the pain or itching. A prescription for an antiviral drug that can shorten the duration and severity of the outbreak and also reduce the risk of complications.\nAlthough shingles is less contagious than chickenpox, there are steps individuals can take towards prevention. There have been reports of airborne transmission — so it’s highly recommended that those with an active outbreak also avoid direct contact with newborn babies, pregnant women, and anyone with a weakened immune system. Frequent hand-washing, covering a shingles rash, and avoiding the urge to scratch are ways to prevent spreading the virus to others during an active outbreak. At-home remedies that might help with discomfort include wet compresses, calamine lotion, and oatmeal baths, pain relievers and fever reducers (though avoiding aspirin is a critical recommendation for young children, as it can lead to Reye’s syndrome).\nFortunately, there are also effective preventative strategies for avoiding a shingles infection all together. First, there’s the chickenpox vaccine, which most children receive as part of routine pediatric immunization in the United States. For individuals age 50 and over, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also approved the use of the shingles vaccine. While neither of these vaccines guarantees immunity, they can both help to reduce the onset, duration, and severity of outbreaks if they do occur.\nTo learn more about the condition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has additional information. If you’re experiencing concerning symptoms or are interested in being vaccinated, it may be a good idea to talk with your health care provider for more advice.Alice!', 'What is the recommendation for adult vaccines?\nThanks to advances in vaccine medicine, we live in a world where our immune systems can be taught to fight off a disease before we fall ill. As adults age, however, their immune systems begin to weaken, limiting the response to infectious bacteria and viruses in their bodies. Adult vaccines boost immune response and decrease likelihood of falling ill.\nAlthough you might have stayed on schedule for immunization as a child, protection provided by vaccines begins to wane over time. It is true that vaccination does not guarantee protection against an illness, but the increased protection does mitigate risks posed to yourself and your loved ones.\nThe CDC recommends that healthy adults aged 19 and older who are up-to-date with their childhood vaccinations receive the flu, Td/Tdap, shingles, and pneumococcal vaccines. If you have medical conditions which you believe might increase the risk of contracting a vaccine preventable illness, take the CDC’s Adult Vaccine Quiz.\nInfluenza, or the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by a viral infection of the nose, throat, and lungs. The virus travels from person to person through infectious droplets expelled from the nose or mouth, but chances of contracting the virus decrease to between 40-60% with the administration of a flu shot. Recommended once each year, influenza is the most frequent of the adult vaccines.\nAccording to CNN, the vaccine typically protects only 50%-60% of those immunized. While the influenza vaccination does not guarantee protection against the virus, medical professionals maintain it is still the best way to protect yourself against the flu.\nFor people 65 years and older, there is an even greater risk of severe flu disease. The CDC estimates that between 71-85% of flu-related deaths and 54-70% of flu-related hospitalizations occur among this age group.\nThe Fluzone High-dose, recommended for those above the age of 65, is four times the strength of a regular flu shot, intended to invoke a stronger immune response in the recipient. One study found the high dose injection to be 24.2% more effective than the regular injection in adults older than 64.\nCommon side effects associated with the flu shot include: (1) Soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given; (2) low grade fever; (3) muscle aches; or (4) toughness/itching at the injection site. These reactions typically present soon after the flu shot and last one to two days.\nIf you experience a life-threatening allergic reaction, such as (1) breathing problems; (2) hoarseness or wheezing; (3) hives; (4) paleness; (5) weakness; (6) increased heart rate; or (7) dizziness, seek medical attention immediately.\nTetanus, the “T” in Tdap and Td, is unlike other vaccine-preventable diseases in that it is not spread through human contact. The bacteria that causes Tetanus enters the body through breaks in the skin – like a cut or puncture wound – and can be found in soil, dust, or manure.\nMost often, individuals who are infected with tetanus experience stiffness in the jaw, neck, and abdominal muscles; as well as difficulty swallowing and muscle spasms. In some cases, fever, sweating, elevated blood pressure, and increased heart rate also indicate a Tetanus infection.\nDiphtheria, the “D” in Tdap and Td, is a highly infections bacterial disease caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Often life-threatening, Diphtheria can affect the respiratory (involving the nose, throat, and tonsils) or cutaneous (involving the skin) systems.\nSymptoms of Diphtheria often include weakness, sore throat, fever, and swollen glands in the neck. As the bacteria embeds itself in the lining of the skin or respiratory system, the toxin released destroys healthy tissue. The infected tissue then forms a gray coating that can build up in the throat or nose, making it difficult to breathe.\nPertussis, the “P” in DTaP, also known as Whooping Cough, is a highly contagious respiratory tract disease caused by Bordetella pertussis. These bacteria can live in the mouth, nose, and throat, making it easy to spread through droplets produced by coughing or sneezing.\nPertussis symptoms generally occur within 7 to 10 days of infection and include mild fever, runny nose, and a cough. In most cases, what starts as a mild cough develops into a paroxysmal cough over time, followed by whooping.\nThe DTaP vaccination is licensed only for infants, adolescents, and children under the age of 7. For adults seeking protection from Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis, Tdap was developed. The CDC recommends a single dose of Tdap for people between the ages of 11 and 64.\nTd, one of the adult vaccines recommended every ten years following initial DTaP or Tdap vaccination, protects against Tetanus and Diphtheria, but not Pertussis. If unsure of your vaccine history, it is recommended that adults first receive a dose of Tdap, then the Td booster every 10 years following.\nSide effects of vaccination vary by case, ranging from redness and swelling at the site of the injection, to hives, swelling of the face and throat, a quickened heartbeat, dizziness, or weakness.\nShingles, also known as Herpes Zoster or Zoster, is a painful skin rash that usually presents on a single side of the face or body. Caused by the same virus that causes the chickenpox, Varicella Zoster, shingles typically affects those above the age of 50, and is significantly less common in younger populations. Shingles can only be contracted by someone who has already introduced the chickenpox virus to their system.\nThe shingles rash usually lasts between 2 to 4 weeks, and is often accompanied by fever, headache, chills, and an upset stomach, in addition to pain. Roughly 1 in 5 people find that their pain continues long after the rash has cleared, referred to as post-herpetic neuralgia.\nAlthough shingles cannot be transferred from person to person, it is possible for someone who has never had the chickenpox to contract the virus from someone with shingles. This, however, is not common.\nShingrix, a new vaccine approved by the FDA on October 20th 2017, is a non-live, recombinant subunit injection given intramuscularly in a series of two doses, and, unlike some other adult vaccines, is recommended only for those age 50 and older.\nCompared with the previous vaccine, Zostavax, which was licensed in 2006 and reduced the risk of shingles by only 50%, Shingrix is significantly more effective. In clinical trials, Shingrix proved 90% effective in preventing shingles as well as the chronic nerve pain associated with the virus.\nThe most common side effects were sore arms and pain following injection. More general side effects included muscle ache, fatigue, shivering, fever, upset stomach and headaches, and typically resolve within three days.\nPneumonia is an infection of one or both sides of the lungs that causes the air sacs to fill with fluid and spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. Symptoms range in severity from a phlegmy cough, to fever, chills, and trouble breathing. A person can be a carrier even if they do not feel sick.\nPeople above the age of 65 experience more serious cases of pneumonia, as well as those with preexisting medical conditions. In the U.S. alone, 50,000 people die from the illness each year, 18,000 of those above the age of 65.\nTreatment of pneumonia ranges from oral antibiotics to hospitalization, depending on the severity of the illness. Some people take weeks to recover from pneumonia.\nThe CDC recommends 2 pneumococcal adult vaccines for those 65 and older: first, the pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13) and, at least one year later, the pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPSV23).\nThe first vaccine, the pneumococcal conjugate, protects against 13 strains of pneumonia-causing bacteria and has been found to be 75% effective in preventing invasive pneumococcal disease, and 45% effective at preventing non-invasive pneumonia. The second, the pneumococcal polysaccharide has been found 50-85% effective against the 23 strains of pneumonia-causing bacteria it covers, and aids in preventing infections like meningitis and bacteremia.\nSide effects associated with the pneumococcal vaccines include drowsiness, swelling at the injection site, fever, chills, muscle pain, and changes in behavior.\nNational Vaccine Injury Compensation Program\nAdult vaccines, and those for children, are equally important parts of public health, working to save lives by preventing disease. Most of the time, vaccines are administered without any serious problems. Like with any medication, however, there is a risk of side effects, ranging from mild to serious.\nFor this reason, the US government created the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP), a “no-fault” alternative to the traditional legal system. Petitions can be filed by any individual, at any age, after developing an injury believed to be a result of a covered vaccine, if jurisdictional requirements are met.\nConway Homer, P.C. is the most experienced vaccine injury law firm in the United States. We represent clients injured by adult vaccines from all 50 states and have advocated for landmark cases that have shaped the Vaccine Program and made it friendlier and more generous to those individuals who suffer from vaccine injuries.

Are you sure you want to continue?"", 'Software maintenance is a crucial phase in the software development life cycle that involves modifying, enhancing, and updating software applications after their initial deployment. It encompasses a range of activities to ensure that the software remains functional, reliable, and up-to-date throughout its lifecycle. Software maintenance is essential for addressing issues, improving performance, and adapting software to changing requirements.\nTypes of Software Maintenance\nSoftware maintenance can be categorized into the following types:\n- Corrective Maintenance: This involves addressing and fixing issues reported by users or discovered during testing.\n- Adaptive Maintenance: It involves modifying the software to adapt to changes in the environment, such as operating system upgrades or hardware changes.\n- Perfective Maintenance: This focuses on improving the software’s functionality or performance based on user feedback or changing requirements.\n- Preventive Maintenance: It aims to prevent future issues by proactively identifying and resolving potential problems.\nImportance of Software Maintenance\nIn today’s competitive landscape, choosing the right software maintenance company is paramount for ensuring your application’s long-term success. Software maintenance is vital for several reasons:\n- Despite rigorous testing, bugs and issues may still arise after software deployment. Maintenance helps in identifying and rectifying these bugs to ensure smooth operation.\n- As business needs evolve, software must be adaptable to meet new requirements and handle changes in the operating environment.\n- Maintenance allows for adding new features and functionalities, improving the software’s capabilities and user experience.\n- With the ever-increasing risk of cyber threats, software maintenance includes regular security updates and patches to protect against vulnerabilities.\n- Through maintenance, performance bottlenecks can be identified and optimized to ensure optimal efficiency.\nSoftware Maintenance Life Cycle\nThe Software Maintenance Life Cycle encompasses several key phases, each serving a specific purpose in the overall maintenance process:\n1. Problem Identification and Reporting\nThe first phase involves identifying issues and maintenance needs. Users, as well as automated monitoring systems, may report problems encountered during the software’s operation. These issues could range from functional errors and performance bottlenecks to security vulnerabilities or compatibility problems with new environments.\n2. Analysis and Planning\nThe maintenance team begins the analysis and planning phase once the issues are reported. The team thoroughly investigates each problem to understand its root cause and potential impact on the software’s overall performance and user experience.\n3. Implementation of Changes\nThe maintenance team implements the required modifications based on the planned approach in this phase. Depending on the complexity of the changes, this stage may involve tasks such as coding new features, updating existing code, fixing bugs, or optimizing performance.\n4. Testing and Quality Assurance\nAfter implementing the changes, the software undergoes rigorous testing to ensure that the modifications do not introduce new issues or conflicts with existing functionalities.\n5. Deployment and Release\nOnce the changes are thoroughly tested and verified, they are deployed to the production environment as part of a new software release.

22	Which one is bigger in length, a Gulf Flounder or a Cabezon fish when they are fully grown?	A Cabezon fish can grow larger, reaching up to 39 inches in length, while Gulf Flounder typically don't grow longer than 23 inches.	"['Saltwater fishing is known for beautiful, colorful fish that are caught miles offshore. That doesn’t necessarily mean that all saltwater fish fall into those categories.\nFlounder are one of the most highly targeted fish in the country, and over the next couple of minutes, you will learn why along with some top flounder fishing tips and how to catch flounder like a pro.\nTypes of Flounder (Flounder Identification)\nFlounder is an odd fish, plain and simple. They are flat, brown, and have both eyeballs on one side of their heads.\nWhile they look like a doormat in most cases, there are some variations among the different species, so we will start by breaking down how to identify the flounder that live in the waters you plan to fish.\nOlive brown on top and white on the bottom. Gulf flounder have 3 distinct spots that are larger and more pronounced than the rest, and they make up the points of a triangle on the top of the fish. They can be found living in shallow water from North Carolina all the way to Southern Florida.\nSwimming in the shallow saltwater from North Carolina down to Northern Mexico, this species is darker in complexion than the gulf version. Their spots tend to be more blotchy than round, and even disappear in the larger specimens.\nOn the West Coast of the United States, Starry Flounder can be found in the mud anywhere from shallow water, to 900 feet deep. These flatfish are a bit lighter colored and can grow up to 3 feet long.\nThe flounder you will find from Maine to the Carolinas are called Summer Flounder. They are lighter brown or sand-colored. Growing to about 23 inches, these fish can weigh up to 5 pounds. They are caught in great numbers near Cape Cod.\nWith a deepwater flounder, the windowpane is normally found about 150 feet down. They live along the Atlantic Shelf, off the East Coast of the United States. These fish are very light with dark brown spots and grow to roughly 18 inches when mature.\nAlmost as dark as mud, these fish are small and never grow more than 12 inches in length. At a near maximum weight of 1 pound, they do not have very much meat and are therefore pressured less by anglers. They are found from the Chesapeake Bay to the Gulf of St. Lawrence.\nWhat Do I Need for Flounder Fishing? (Must Have Equipment)\nGear for flounder fishing will vary slightly based on whether or not you are fishing in shallow or deep water.\nMost are caught in the shallow bays or estuaries, so gear does not have to be very heavy. Because the most common flounder are small, typical bass gear and live bait setups will do the trick.\nFishing Rods and Reels\nFlounder are not huge. Typically, you will not find too many fish being caught that are over 20 inches, and the legal keepers are 14 inches in most regions where they are caught.\nThis, paired with the fact that flounder live in shallow water, will let you get away with using a small, lightweight rod. Using a 6- foot to 8-foot medium-fast action rod will be plenty. Reel size can be anything larger than a 25 (sometimes referred to as 2500) size.\nFlounder are designed to eat baitfish. They lay in waiting for baitfish to swim within striking distance and ambush attack. This means you should try your best to use baitfish-style jigs or live bait. A major key when fishing for flounder is to have a natural presentation.\nThese fish will generally feed on bait that is moving with the current, not against it. So when casting or drifting, make sure your bait or lures are flowing with the current. Also, chartreuse is a great color for catching flounder when using a jig or paddle tail swimbait.\nLine and Tackle\nLine size will be heavier than you would think for the size of the fish. With a normal casting rig, you would think that a 10-pound test line would be plenty for a fish this size. The thing is, running a tandem rig requires you to run heavier lines, and that is the traditional setup for catching these fish.\nMost anglers will run a tandem setup, meaning that they have a jig at the end of their line but also have one tied on a few feet up. Tying that knot for the suspended jig creates a weak spot in the line, which the heavier 30-pound test makes up for.\nGig and fish ruler\nGigging flounder is generally done during the dark. Anglers use a trident spear to take flounder from shallow bays with these tools. This is generally practiced on the Gulf Coast and is a great way to take multiple fish on a single outing.\nA fish ruler is a tool that inexperienced giggers use to lay next to a flounder as it lays still, waiting on its next meal. The fish do not move, so laying a ruler down shows that a fish either is or is not of legal keeping size.\nHow to Catch Flounder (Tips from a Pro Angler)\nFrom a Pier\nPier fishing for flounder is one of the tougher methods of catching these fish. Because they do not move a ton, you have to be one of the early birds to catch fish that have moved in overnight. The flounder feed on bait that swims around the pier pylons, so positioning your bait along with the natural built will give you the best chance at hooking up.\nFrom a Boat\nFlounder fishing from a boat is the way to go. You can sneak up into the shallows and cast out or drift over flounder you spot and have great chances of hooking into one. Because you are mobile, trying multiple spots is easy by boat. You can also put fish in the live well of a boat so that you can throw back less desirable fish if you get into a group where you are catching a bunch of fish.\nFrom the shore\nShore fishing for flounder can be done in tidal pools, rivers, or in the surf. Because the fish like flat bottoms in shallow water, they are easily caught from just about any shoreline in either salt or brackish water. Cast out live bait or bottom bounce a shoreline, and you are bound to catch some flounder if they are around.\nThe drift and bounce\nProbably the best method of catching flounder is the drift method, bouncing your jig or swimbait along the bottom. It is super simple, and you can use either one or two baits on your line at the same time. The trick is to drift with the current, not the wind. Drop your bait down until it touches the bottom and then reel up about a foot, then drift along subtly jigging your bait until a fish bites. Because you are not using circle hooks, be sure to set the hook so that the flounder does not spit the bait and get away!\nThe gigging method\nIf you have a flat bottom boat and a spear, you can have so much fun gigging flounder. Take the boat into the shallows at night and use a lighting setup to spot the fish lying along the bottom. Once you decide that the fish is of the proper size, jab them with your spear and yank them topside. Piling up flounder on a night of gigging with friends is almost too much fun.\nWhere to Catch Flounder? (5 Regions Where Found)\n1. Catching Flounders in Texas\nEverything is bigger in Texas, including the Southern Flounder. Female fish of this species can grow to 25 inches, so they are traditionally targeted in Texas. These fish are also known to be the best-tasting flatfish, so they are pursued by many anglers. Texas flounder fishing tips are to gig them or drift jig for them in the Gulf. The high numbers of fish mean that there are plenty to pursue, so bring friends and family and catch yourself a flounder feast.\n2. Catching Flounders in Florida\nCatching flounder at John\'s Pass or Fort De Soto Park in Tampa Bay is one of the hottest bites during the summer. Using cut bait or live bait in the shallow flats adjacent to the structure will have you catching tons of flounder, among all the other possible saltwater species in these waters. Fishing by the marinas is a great place to start if you are an out-of-towner on vacation or do not know where to start.\n3. Catching Flounders in North Carolina\nFishing for flounder in NC is as good as it gets. Fishing for flounder in Murrells Inlet is the best of the best. This area of the country has both local and migrating fish that live within its waters, making it a flatfish Mecca. All methods and techniques are utilized by locals and tourists alike down here. Once you get your fill of flounder, head off into deeper waters and try your hand at catching some reds.\n4. Catching Flounders in New Jersey\nYou won’t hear anyone talking about flounder up in the Northeast. This is “fluke” country. While some people call all flatfish flounder, these anglers in the cold water refer to the summer flounder as a fluke. Fishing from boats or piers is most common, and the fish can grow to about 2 feet in length.\n5. Catching Flounder in Alabama\nThe back bays of Alabama are home to significant populations of flounder. Fishing piers and pylons around docks and bridges will be your best bet. Incoming tides make for a great time to fish these spots because the rising water brings fresh bait into the shallows where the flounder live and feed. Mobile Bay is a great place to start if you are in town visiting.\nBest Seasons to Catch Flounder\nPeople also Ask (FAQs)\nWhat size hooks for flounder?\nJig hooks and live bait hooks in the 6/0 to 8/0 size work well for flounder. They have a mouth that is similar in size to bass, so keep that in mind as you are shopping for the tackle. Most jig heads and swimbaits will do just fine for flounder.\nWhat is the best bait for winter flounder?\nBloodworms and sandworms are great for catching flounder in the winter. The best bait is always going to be what the fish are naturally feeding on during any given time of the year, so do not pigeonhole yourself by being married to any specific baits. Pay attention to the bait that is in your area and try using or mimicking that.\nWhat is the difference between a fluke and a flounder?\nFluke vs Flounder, what\'s the difference? Fluke is another term for a flounder found in the North Atlantic. They can also be referred to as ""Summer Flounder."" Some Chesapeake Bay anglers refer to Striped Bass as ""Rockfish,"" which is the same sort of situation.\nSo, while flounder may not be the largest or best-looking fish, they are one of the best eating and most fun to catch fish in saltwater areas. Just the thought of filleting up a batch of flounder and stuffing it with crab meat is making me salivate as I write this, so go out and try your luck, have fun, and tell your friends about the tricks you’ve learned!', 'SIZE: 16-30 in. max 39 in.\nDISTINCTIVE FEATURES: 1.

23	What are the essential first aid steps for treating different types of burns?	For burn treatment, first cool the burn under cool running water for 20 minutes, but never use ice as it can damage tissue and restrict circulation. For minor burns (first-degree or small second-degree), apply moisturizer after cooling and use sterile gauze for protection. Never apply ointments, grease, or oil as they contribute to the cooking process. For chemical burns, clean with copious amounts of water. For severe burns (third or fourth degree) or burns larger than 3 inches covering major joints, face, hands, feet, or groin, seek immediate medical care. Emergency care may include IV fluids, burn cream, tetanus shots, and antibiotics. The doctor will assess the burn using the Rule of 9's and follow the ABCDE approach for treatment.	"['Presentation on theme: ""If the practice is dangerous, explain why the practice is dangerous.""— Presentation transcript:\n1 If the practice is dangerous, explain why the practice is dangerous. Signs of SafetyDirections: Identify the practices described below as safe or dangerous. Decide if the practice is safe or dangerous.If the practice is dangerous, explain why the practice is dangerous.\n2 1. Fran stored the cast iron fry pan on the top shelf to get it out of the way.\n3 2. Jody put her long hair into a ponytail before she went into the kitchen to cook supper.\n4 3. Doris stapled the microwave cord in place to keep people from falling over it.\n5 4. Debra chose to use knives that were not very sharp so that she would not cut herself.\n6 5. When the butcher knife slipped out of Brenda’s fingers, she tried her best to catch it.\n7 6. Josh could not find the can opener, so he used a sharp knife to open the can of milk.\n8 What to do if there is a fire: Fires:Every kitchen should have a fire extinguisher.Turn off heat, cover pan or pour salt or baking soda on flames.Never use water – grease will spatter and burn.Never attempt to carry a pan with burning contents – Fire Dept. – go outside.In case of fire:Turn off appliance.Use baking soda instead of water.Use a fire extinguisher.If clothing catches on fire, drop to the ground and roll.STOP.DROP. ROLL.Crawl on the ground to get out of smoke filled room.\n9 First aid for Burns –Cool it with cold water/prolonged ice will freeze tissue.Avoid ointments, grease and oil (contributes to the cooking process of the burn).Tell your teacher!!!!\n10 What to do if you cut yourself: Cuts:Keep knives sharp and use properly.Use a drawer divider or knife rack for sharp cutting tools.Don’t try to catch a falling knife.Don’t soak knives in sink or dishpan or water.Sweep up broken glass from the floor using broom and dustpan.Use wet paper towel instead of bare fingers.First aid for cuts -Stop severe bleeding with the pressure of a thick cloth; get medical help.Minor cuts – wash with soap and water, blot dry and bandage.Tell your teacher!!!!\n11 Personal cleanliness involves the following: Wash hands before food preparation; after sneezing, coughing, using the rest room, and touching the face or hair.Keep hair away from the face.Wear clean clothes/apron (dirty clothing has bacteria).Don\'t handle food if you have an open cut or sore (staph).Don\'t cook and taste food with the same spoon; licking fingers is prohibited.Wash hands after handling raw meat and eggs.\n12 Kitchen cleanliness involves the following: Wipe up spills and remove dirty utensils.Wash the cutting board used for meat before cutting anything else on it.Don\'t wipe hands on dish towels; use separate towels so dishes don\'t get bacteria.Don\'t flick each other with dish towels or use a dish towel or dish cloth that has been dropped on the floor. (The floor is an excellent place for staphylococcus to grow.)Wash/dust off cans.Wash surfaces and cutting boards with antibacterial soap periodically.Use hot soapy water on dishes.Don\'t store food under the sink - it becomes damp.', 'Burn injury: When to seek emergency medical care\nWhat are burns?\nSevere skin damage that causes the cells to die is called a burn. It can range from minor to major injuries. Depending on the severity of the burn, the course of treatment changes.\nSome tips when dealing with burn injuries are:\n- Small scalds with some redness can be treated at home, while burns with blisters, deeper depth, larger surface area, or affecting major joints like spine or ankle need medical attention.\n- Never apply ice to a burn. It can damage the affected area even more and slow down the healing process.\nWhat are the symptoms of a burn?\nThe severity of a burn depends on the extent of the damage i.e. the depth of the skin it affects. A minor burn can be distinguished from a more serious one that requires medical attention through the classification of burns. The following are the types, ranging from minor to severe:\nIt causes minimal skin damage since only the outer layer (epidermis) is damaged. First-degree burns heal within 7-10 days without leaving a scar. It is accompanied by:\n- Minor swelling\nSecond-degree burn (Partial thickness):\nThe damage extends beyond the epidermis into the second layer of skin (dermis), and the burn is more serious. Depending on its extent, it may heal within 2-3 weeks. There may be pigment changes in the skin. It is accompanied by:\nThird-degree burn (Full-thickness):\nThe damage reaches the fat layer under the skin, making it an extremely severe burn injury. They require immediate medical attention, and there is no set timeline for their healing. The pain may not be felt if the nerve endings are damaged. Surgery may also be required to prevent scarring. The symptoms may be:\n- Stiff, waxy skin\n- Leathery skin\n- Dark brown color\n- Undeveloped blisters\nThis is the most severe burn category. The damage extends well beyond the skin and may even affect muscles and bones. Similar to third-degree burns, there may be no pain felt if the nerve endings are damaged. Symptoms are:\n- Blackened skin\n- Charred skin\n- Absence of pain\nWhile a first-degree or second-degree burn may be treated at home, third-degree and fourth-degree burns require medical attention. Even in the case of the former two, if the affected area is large or the burn is on a major joint like the spine, ankle, elbow, etc, it is advisable to seek medical help.\nWhat are the causes of burns?\nBurns can be caused by several substances. Some of them based on the category of burns are:\n- First-degree burn:\n- Scalds from hot liquid/surface\n- Minor electrical burns\n- Second-degree burn:\n- Severe sunburns\n- Accidents with hot boiling water\n- Accidents with flame\n- Third-degree burn:\n- Exposure to fire\n- Burns from electricity or lightning\n- Prolonged exposure to hot liquids/objects\n- Chemical burns\nFourth-degree burns are caused due to similar circumstances as third-degree burns. The extent of the damage increases though, and so does the long-term outlook for recovery.\nHow to manage burns?\nFirst aid for minor burns\nMinor burns that cause pain, blisters, superficial redness or are smaller than 3 inches in diameter do not require emergency care. With proper care at home, they resolve within a few weeks.\n- Cooldown the burn under cool, running water for 20 minutes total duration. Avoid the use of cold water or ice (ice slush) as they restrict blood circulation and increase the depth of the burn.\n- Do not break the blisters. If the blister breaks, clean with clean water and mild soap (optional).\n- Use lotion or moisturizer only once the burn is cooled to prevent drying and pain relief.\n- Apply plastic (cling) wrap to burn wound to prevent heat loss.\n- For chemical burns, clean with copious amounts of water to dilute chemical exposure.\n- Use sterilized gauze bandage to loosely wrap the burn to keep the air off and protect blistered skin.\n- If needed, over-the-counter medicines may be used for pain relief.\nWhen to see a doctor\nSeek immediate care for major burns that are deep or larger than 3 inches in diameter, covering the face, hands, feet, groin, or major joint. Also, burns that appear charred or patchy or that leave the skin dry and leathery need immediate attention.\nThe doctor may prescribe the following depending on the severity of the burn:\n- IV fluids to prevent dehydration and organ damage.\n- Burn cream to maintain moisture lock, prevent infection and facilitate healing.\n- Tetanus shot and antibiotics to prevent infection.\n- Pain medicines.\nWhat is emergency care for serious burns?\nThe treatments rendered in the first 4 hours of the incident can make a lot of difference in saving the life of the patient. Initial assessment, management of burn, evaluation of burn size, and fluid replacement plays a major role in the first 24 hours after burn injury. The ABCDE approach mentioned below is a priority response to address the complications of burns quickly and efficiently. The emergency care for serious burns is required to:\n- To stop the burn\n- For essential ABCDE monitoring, the following is required:\n- Airway maintenance\n- Breathing and ventilation\n- Circulation and cardiac status\n- Disability, neurological deficit, and gross deformity\n- Examine associated injuries and maintain warm Environment\n- To determine the extent of the burn, use the Rule of 9’s to assess the body surface area that has gotten burned. This helps to guide treatment decisions.\nIn some cases, surgical procedures may be necessary:\n- Decompression to ease breathing.\n- Reconstruction and skin grafting to assist healing and enhance cosmetic appeal.\n- Nasogastric tubing for feeding.\nWhat are the complications of burns?\nComplications generally arise with third-degree or fourth-degree burns, wherein the body is exposed to outside infections through broken skin, risks blood loss, etc. Some of them are:\n- Risk of infections: Severe burns make the body vulnerable to bacterial infections like tetanus and can even cause sepsis. Both of them are life-threatening conditions.\n- Hypovolemia (low blood volume): Blood vessel damage can lead to loss of fluids in the body. Due to the loss of blood and fluids, the heart may not be able to pump enough blood to all the body parts.\n- Hypothermia (low body temperature): While this seems uncharacteristic for a burn, the increased loss of blood can cause the body temperature to drop to dangerous levels.\n- Bone and joint problems: Deep burns can affect the movement of certain joints. When scar tissue forms over the burns on a joint, it may cause the skin, muscles, or tendons to tighten or shorten, which displaces them.\n- Scarring: Third-degree and fourth-degree burns may require skin grafting and surgeries.\nHow to prevent burns?\nIt is essential to follow prevention routines at home to avoid burn injuries. Children, especially, are vulnerable to burns. Proper precautionary measures can help to prevent burn injuries for everyone at home.\n- Never leave items on the stove unattended.\n- Keep children out of the kitchen.\n- Do not wear synthetic or loose-fitting clothes in the kitchen.\n- Discard electronics with damaged or exposed wires.\n- Keep chemicals, matches, lighters, etc. out of the reach of pets and children.\n- Wear gloves and other protective gear while using chemicals.\n- Keep the temperature of the geyser between 49°C – 54°C.\n- Wear sunscreen and avoid peak sunlight.\n- Smoke away from the bed and curtains.\nThe severity of burns depends on their extent i.e. the area of damaged skin and the depth. As a rule of thumb, if the burn is deep or larger than 3 inches in diameter, covering the face, hands, feet, groin, or major joint, it is essential to seek medical attention. This generally occurs in the case of third-degree or fourth-degree burns. Always take the necessary precautions at home to prevent the possibility of any minor or life-threatening burn injuries.\nRead more about Burns symptoms, causes and treatment\nIf you find any of the above mentioned of Burns then\nBook an Appointment with the best dermatologist in hyderabad\n- “Burns: Types, treatments, and more”.

24	As someone considering becoming a foster parent, I'm curious about whether foster parents maintain relationships with the children after they become adults - what's been observed about these long-term bonds?	Even after becoming adults, foster children maintain bonds with their foster parents and know they can still turn to them for support. While the primary goal is reunification with biological parents, foster parents often end up adopting the children. At Children's Home Society, foster parents frequently continue working with biological parents even after reunification is completed.	['National Foster Care Appreciation Month in May shines an important light on families and professionals helping children and youth in foster care find safety, stability and success.\nAlthough foster families are needed for children of all ages, teenagers are especially in need of homes.\nNatalie Monzon, public relations specialist for the Children’s Home Society of Florida, stated in an email, “Sadly, a common misconception is teens enter foster care due to some fault of their own. As a result, older kids are less likely to be matched with foster families.”\nUsually teens enter foster care because of circumstances beyond their control, including neglect and abandonment, Ms. Monzon stated. “Entering foster care is scary and overwhelming for children at any age, but loving foster parents provide stability for children and teens when they need it most.”\nThe CHS is recruiting more foster families to help care for children throughout Volusia, Flagler and Putnam counties. Homes for teenagers are especially needed. Besides the CHS, other foster care licensing agencies in Volusia County include Devereaux, One More Child, Neighbor to Family and Florida United Methodist Children’s Home. Community Partnership for Children also works on placement with licensed foster families in its network.\nCHS has 62 foster homes in Volusia, Flagler and Putnam, according to Arminda Jones, a CHS recruiting and licensing supervisor in the Daytona Beach office. There are 209 children for all the above agencies that have teens residing in out of home care in the three counties. She added 75 of those children are with relatives and non-relatives. The remaining teens are in licensed placements, which include foster homes and residential (group home) placements. A few others are missing/runaways or in a correctional facility.\n“Group homes are to some degree still institutional and that’s why we are pushing teen foster homes,” Ms. Jones said. “It’s a proven fact that any child going into a foster home, when they turn 18, they do considerably better when they have that family to back them and be their support in the community.”\nShe stressed that even after becoming adults, foster children keep a bond with their foster parents and know they can still turn to them. Although the goal of CHS and other agencies with foster homes is reunification with biological parents, many times foster parents end up adopting the children. At CHS, foster parents often work with biological parents even after a reunification is completed.\nCHS brings stability to more than 2,000 children each year with nearly 60% safely reunified with their families and 40% finding forever homes, Miss Jones said. A youth exiting foster care at age 18 without a family results in 40% becoming homeless, 52% becoming unemployed and 60% of young men are convicted of a crime.\nAs for National Foster Care Appreciation Month, she stated, “It’s the month where we can look at these people who open their homes, their hearts, their lives to these children. It’s so nice to see the love they give the children and they are raising them as their own. (And) these foster homes are also a support for the biological parents on reunification so they help them out, too. There’s a huge need for foster parents in Florida and there’s a huge need for the teens.”\nChildren come into foster care with few belongings, so the public can help by sending the agency gift cards to distribute to foster parents to help buy clothes for children.\nMarc and Priscilla Small are CHS foster parents. In a joint statement they said, “To us, being foster parents means using our most valuable and personal resources to provide help to children in desperate need. Those resources being our family, our home and the love that we have for everyone we care for.”\nWhatever the reason a child ends up in foster care, it has a huge impact on a child’s life.\n“We strive to be a positive part of this impact,” the Smalls said. “Our goal isn’t to erase what they’re going through, but to help them manage the process. We provide normalcy, consistency, love and structure; at a time where these children could be missing all of the above.”\nThe children starting to flourish in their home is a wonderful feeling, they stated. “It’s amazing to see some of the transitions to great academic students, celebrated birthday parties, school plays, extracurricular activities, community involvements. All these activities let us know that our role has been a positive one.”\nIf interested in becoming a foster parent, call Ms. Jones at (386) 795-2168.

25	How is the famous painting of The Last Supper displayed differently in the historical church of Melaka?	The Last Supper painting in Christ Church is made up of glazing and glossy tiles in different colors instead of canvas and oil paint, while still retaining the exact appearance of the original.	['When the Dutch took over Melaka from the hand of the Portuguese, they built several buildings for their own purposes. This church was built as a place of worship as they did not have any church for themselves apart from the small chapel built by Portuguese on St. Paul Hill. Like St. Paul Church, this church is one of the most attractive heritage in Melaka that has gone through several stages of change under the governing of different colonials.\nLocated at Jalan Gereja (or known as Church Street!), the church is painted in coral red with huge white cross at the middle. It is the most distinguished one among adjacent buildings that are also painted in similar red colour. Surrounded by beautiful landscape with greenery and flowers, you will probably feel like visiting a vintage church somewhere in Europe!\nHowever, there is something unique and unusual that you might not be able to get in Europe but only in Melaka – the colourful decorated trishaw! In front of the church, there will always be striking trishaws lining up, offering the service to tour you around the town. The existence of trishaw makes the church’s surrounding area more lively and outstanding!\nAs mentioned, this Christ Church was built by the Dutch. They started the construction in 1741 and completed it in 1753. At that time, the church played its vital role as a place for the Dutch to pray. Later, when British took over Melaka for a temporary term, they converted the original Protestant church into an Anglican church. At the same time the British added the bell and weathercock on the church.\nYou can visit the church by getting the permission of the person-in-charge because without having a look at the interior, you might not be able to recognize the magnificent construction of this building. One surprising fact with regards to the construction of Christ Church that everyone has to know is the ceiling beams. The Dutch, with their superior architecture skills, had constructed the beams of the church by using huge tree trunk with no joints between each other.\nBesides, you will also be attracted by the Brass Bible that has a Dutch version of St. John engraved on it. While you are walking, mind you step on the floor as there are old tombstones with engraving of Armenian script integrated in. Hence, take a slower and smaller step so that you can have a closer look at the valuable and unique tombstones.\n“The Last Supper” – the famous painting is being presented in Christ Church in a creative way. The painting is made up of glazing and glossy tiles in different colour instead of canvas and oil paint. However, the originality of the painting is being retained where every inch of it looks exactly the same as the original.\nThe church is located opposite to Stadthuys, the former official residence for the Dutch government. In the middle, you can see a beautiful fountain and that is the Queen Victoria Fountain built by the British. Further, there is a windmill that faces the fountain. In such as small area, one can experience the art of architecture that brings you back to the olden days!\nMost parts of the church were constructed manually including the pews and windows. It still stayed the same even though it had been built more than 200 years ago. Until now, the church is still functioning with services available in English, Chinese and Tamil languages. In fact, it is the oldest church that is still in operation in Malaysia – another interesting fact to know about this Church!']	['<urn:uuid:f159d004-6ad1-465a-9ac3-70f3e79f692d>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	17	33	603

27	titan earth similarities liquid cycle atmosphere conditions life formation comparison	Titan shares several remarkable similarities with Earth while having unique characteristics. Like Earth, it's the only other place in the Solar System with rainfall and active exchanges between surface liquids and atmospheric fog, though on Titan this involves methane instead of water. It has a comparable atmospheric pressure and is the only other body with a nitrogen-rich dense atmosphere. While Earth's life depends on water, Titan's cold conditions and unique chemistry, including hydrogen cyanide in its atmosphere and possible ammonia-water mixtures on its surface, suggest it might support a different form of prebiotic chemistry that could lead to life under non-Earth-like conditions.	['Saturn’s moon Titan has an environment that resembles Earth’s at the time that life first got a foothold, new findings from the Cassini spacecraft suggest.\nTwo close flybys have gathered fresh evidence that ammonia, most likely mixed with water ice, has recently erupted onto the surface of the moon. The likely presence of ammonia on Titan’s icy surface, combined with the abundance of methane and nitrogen in the moon’s thick atmosphere, together suggest that Titan may host a prebiotic brew, says Cassini scientist Robert Nelson of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.\nThe findings, reported by Nelson August 5 in Rio de Janeiro at a meeting of the International Astronomical Union, are based on data gathered by Cassini’s Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer during November and December 2008. The spectrometer records emissions from seven different infrared “windows” — wavelength bands at which radiation from material on Titan’s surface can penetrate the moon’s methane-rich shroud and reach the spacecraft.\nPreviously, more distant flybys of Titan had hinted at the presence of fresh ammonia deposits on the surface. In addition, radar imaging with another Cassini instrument in 2008 had revealed that regions that may harbor ammonia, particularly an area known as Hotei Arcus, have lobe-shaped deposits and flows characteristic of volcanic eruptions.\nAmmonia is known to lower the melting point of water and facilitate icy volcanic activity. Such activity might be triggered by heat leftover from the formation of Titan or gravitational flexing of the moon, notes Cassini researcher Rosaly Lopes of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nCassini swooped low enough during the November and December flybys for the spectrometer to obtain higher-resolution spectra of material at Hotei Arcus. The spectra resemble the pattern expected from ammonia, but because the emissions also overlap with that of frozen water, the ammonia detection is “likely” rather than definitive, Nelson said. Those two flybys also enabled the spectrometer to image Hotei Arcus closely enough to find the same lobe-shaped flow pattern, indicative of volcanic terrain, that the radar instrument had found, Nelson reported at the conference. The flows imaged in the infrared bands appear truncated compared with those in earlier radar images, hinting that newly deposited ammonia on the surface might have covered the markings, he said.\nThe new evidence, combined with the older data, suggests that Titan has a geologically active surface, with ongoing icy volcanic eruptions that carry new deposits of ammonia ice to the surface, Nelson said. Once there, the ammonia may mix with methane and nitrogen — the principal constituents of Titan’s dense atmosphere — to create an environment that could foster life.\nSubscribe to Science News\nGet great science journalism, from the most trusted source, delivered to your doorstep.\nOther researchers have suggested that ammonia is present in Titan’s interior and might even help sustain a liquid water ocean within the moon, comments Cassini scientist Jonathan Lunine of the University of Arizona in Tucson. Ammonia recently found on geologically active Enceladus, one of Titan’s small sister moons, argues in favor of ammonia on Titan, he adds (SN Online: 7/22/09).\nIn addition to lowering the freezing point of liquid water, ammonia also lowers the density of the liquid relative to that of water ice, allowing some liquid to more easily rise to the surface, Lunine says. Adding ammonia to water ice would also create a thick viscous surface flow that might explain the shape and topography of the Hotei Arcus region, he notes.\n“We’re very excited by the results,” Nelson said. Titan may indeed support a prebiotic mixture of chemicals similar to those under which life on Earth evolved.', 'Saturn’s largest moon Titan is a truly fascinating place. Aside from Earth, it is the only place in the Solar System where rainfall occurs and there are active exchanges between liquids on the surface and fog in the atmosphere – albeit with methane instead of water. It’s atmospheric pressure is also comparable to Earth’s, and it is the only other body in the Solar System that has a dense atmosphere that is nitrogen-rich.\nFor some time, astronomers and planetary scientists have speculated that Titan might also have the prebiotic conditions necessary for life. Others, meanwhile, have argued that the absence of water on the surface rules out the possibility of life existing there. But according to a recent study produced by a research team from Cornell University, the conditions on Titan’s surface might support the formation of life without the need for water.\nWhen it comes to searching for life beyond Earth, scientists focus on targets that possess the necessary ingredients for life as we know it – i.e. heat, a viable atmosphere, and water. This is essentially the “low-hanging fruit” approach, where we search for conditions resembling those here on Earth. Titan – which is very cold, quite distant from our Sun, and has a thick, hazy atmosphere – does not seem like a viable candidate, given these criteria.\nHowever, according to the Cornell research team – which is led by Dr. Martin Rahm – Titan presents an opportunity to see how life could emerge under different conditions, one which are much colder than Earth and don’t involve water.\nTheir study – titled “Polymorphism and electronic structure of polyimine and its potential significance for prebiotic chemistry on Titan” – appeared recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). In it, Rahm and his colleagues examined the role that hydrogen cyanide, which is believed to be central to the origin of life question, may play in Titan’s atmosphere.\nPrevious experiments have shown that hydrogen cyanide (HCN) molecules can link together to form polyimine, a polymer that can serve as a precursor to amino acids and nucleic acids (the basis for protein cells and DNA). Previous surveys have also shown that hydrogen cyanide is the most abundant hydrogen-containing molecule in Titan’s atmosphere.\nAs Professor Lunine – the David C. Duncan Professor in the Physical Sciences and Director of the Cornell Center for Astrophysics and Planetary Science and co-author of the study – told Universe Today via email: “Organic molecules, liquid lakes and seas (but of methane, not water) and some amount of solar energy reaches the surface. So this suggests the possibility of an environment that might host an exotic form of life.”\nUsing quantum mechanical calculations, the Cornell team showed that polyimine has electronic and structural properties that could facilitate prebiotic chemistry under very cold conditions. These involve the ability to absorb a wide spectrum of light, which is predicted to occur in a window of relative transparency in Titan’s atmosphere.\nAnother is the fact that polyimine has a flexible backbone, and can therefore take on many different structures (aka. polymorphs). These range from flat sheets to complex coiled structures, which are relatively close in energy. Some of these structures, according to the team, could work to accelerate prebiotic chemical reactions, or even form structures that could act as hosts for them.\n“Polyimine can form sheets,” said Lunine, “which like clays might serve as a catalytic surface for prebiotic reactions. We also find the polyimine absorbs sunlight where Titan’s atmosphere is quite transparent, which might help to energize reactions.”\nIn short, the presence of polyimine could mean that Titan’s surface gets the energy its needs to drive photochemical reactions necessary for the creation of organic life, and that it could even assist in the development of that life. But of course, no evidence has been found that polyimine has been produced on the surface of Titan, which means that these research findings are still academic at this point.\nHowever, Lunine and his team indicate that hydrogen cyanide may very well have lead to the creation of polyimine on Titan, and that it might have simply escaped detection because of Titan’s murky atmosphere. They also added that future missions to Titan might be able to look for signs of the polymer, as part of ongoing research into the possibility of exotic life emerging in other parts of the Solar System.\n“We would need an advanced payload on the surface to sample and search for polyimines,” answered Lunine, “or possibly by a next generation spectrometer from orbit. Both of these are “beyond Cassini”, that is, the next generation of missions.”\nPerhaps when Juno is finished surveying Jupiter’s atmosphere in two years time, NASA might consider retasking it for a flyby of Titan? After all, Juno was specifically designed to peer beneath a veil of thick clouds. They don’t come much thicker than on Titan!\nFurther Reading: PNAS']	['<urn:uuid:faff9c4e-1649-437d-a6e9-dd9ce2b2cd12>', '<urn:uuid:50acb301-a490-4b61-90ec-32e0aadf273d>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	10	102	1416
28	How did music careers offer opportunities for marginalized performers?	Music provided rare professional opportunities for marginalized groups in mid-20th century America. For rural African-American men who had few job options beyond menial field work, gospel quartets offered a meaningful way to make a living through radio and records. They would tour for months, performing in churches, schools, town halls, and street corners, competing in quartet battles to 'wreck the house' and energize crowds. Similarly, in the country music scene, performers like Red Foley found success by innovatively blending musical styles. Foley's recordings mixed elements from pop and R&B while remaining distinctly country, influencing future generations of musicians including Elvis Presley. However, both gospel quartets and country performers often faced financial struggles, with gospel groups being cheated by record executives and relying on church budgets, while even successful artists like Foley faced financial difficulties with IRS troubles later in his career.	"[""Although he’s seldom remembered today, Red Foley was one of the most talented, influential and well-liked performers to ever work in the field of country music. A major force in the rise of the Grand Ole Opry to national prominence, he helped guide the show through some of its most successful years. In addition, he was the first major country star to record regularly in Nashville — producing an incredible string of hits, including the first million-selling country hit recorded in Nashville and the first million-selling gospel record. His smooth, baritone voice and natural rhythm enabled him to move effortlessly from heartfelt ballads to hot hillbilly boogies to the most sincere and moving gospel songs. Along the way, he forged a unique musical style that would help pave the way for the emergence of rock ‘n’ roll.\nIn today’s modern recording world where artists routinely take months or even years to complete albums and the recording costs run can run into hundreds of thousands of dollars, it’s easy to forget that some of the most innovative and influential recordings of the 20th Century were often laid down in just a few hours with no overdubs, no digital manipulation, and no caterer — just raw talent and craftsmanship. Fifty years ago this week, Red Foley spent a little over three days in the studio and produced eight Top 10 hits including “Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy,” the first million-selling country record recorded in Nashville. That Foley was able to perform such a feat is a testament to not only his talent, but to the musicians and producers who worked with him.\nBorn Clyde Julian Foley in Blue Lick, Ky., on June 17, 1910, Foley grew up in nearby Berea, Ky. From an early age he held a fascination with music — encouraged by the easy access to musical instruments his father stocked in the general store the Foleys operated. Local country musicians, both white and black, along with more formal music, influenced the young boy. Recognizing their son’s talent, the Foleys enrolled him in voice lessons at a young age. But despite the formal voice training and precise diction that Foley learned, he was still a small-town country boy and never lost the easy-going style that comes with that background.\nIn 1930, the tall, redheaded Foley joined the WLS Barn Dance in Chicago as a member of the string band, The Cumberland Ridge Runners. Gradually, Foley began to move more and more into the spotlight as a solo artist. By 1937 Foley had gained enough of a reputation that he was able to leave Chicago and help found the Renfro Valley Barn Dance radio show in Cincinnati (the show would later move to an area just outside Berea, Ky.) before returning to WLS in 1940.\nFoley signed with Decca Records in 1941 and recorded one of his most famous songs, “Old Shep.” By the spring of 1946 Foley was well known as a singer and an unflappable emcee. He was a hot commodity in the country field and the person the William Esty Agency — producers of the NBC-broadcast Prince Albert Show portion of the Grand Ole Opry — wanted as host, a position left open by Roy Acuff’s departure over money disputes.\nAlthough there was some initial resentment of the “outsider,” Foley quickly won the skeptics over with his easy-going style. The move to Nashville also turned out to be good for Foley in more ways than just his radio appearances.\nBefore his move to the future Music City, Foley’s records had drifted more and more toward the pop mainstream — light, Western swing or cowboy numbers that were firmly in Gene Autry territory — including one session in 1944 with the Lawrence Welk Orchestra. But the move to Nashville brought him back to his Southern roots and opened new avenues.\n“Red recorded ‘Tennessee Saturday Night’ with Zeke Turner playing that great boogie lick,” renowned sessionman Harold Bradley says. “That was the first record where he had that style. I guess with the move to Nashville, a lot of things happened. Decca producer Paul Cohen found better songs. He found the musicians, he found the studio, something just started going in the right direction.”\nThe right direction indeed — recording in his new surroundings Foley, his band and Paul Cohen produced a series of records that mixed elements from pop and R&B while remaining undeniably hillbilly. “Tennessee Saturday Night,” recorded at Foley’s first session in August 1947 at the newly opened Castle Recording Studio, would spend 40 weeks on Billboard’s Country Singles Chart, reaching No. 1.\nShortly after coming to Nashville, Foley had assembled a band consisting of Zeke Turner on lead guitar, Louis Innis on rhythm guitar, Ernie Newton on bass, Jerry Byrd on steel guitar and Tommy Jackson on fiddle. Known as the “Cumberland Valley Boys,” the band backed Foley on the Opry, his morning radio show on WSM, in live appearances and on records. They quickly gained such a reputation that they effectively became Nashville’s first group of “sessionmen.” In fact, the group was so hot that in November of 1948, all of them except Newton were lured away by an offer from radio station WLW in Cincinnati and the prospect of playing on the greater number of recording sessions held there at the time.\nIn a measure of Foley’s prestige, he simply assembled another band of equal or greater talent. Though they were all young players — the team of Grady Martin on lead guitar, Zeb Turner (Zeke’s brother) on rhythm guitar, Billy Robinson on steel guitar, along with Ernie Newton on bass — made for a powerful combination on records and in live appearances. Between their radio work and the growing number of recording sessions held in Nashville, the members of the band found themselves in great demand.\n“We were like the WSM staff band,” Billy Robinson recalls. “Every time a new guy would come to town we’d work with them. We worked with George Morgan, Hank Snow, Webb Pierce and Carl Smith — recording with them until they got their own bands.”\nIn slightly less than a year, Zeb Turner left the band, Robinson recalls. “Jimmy Selph took over after Zeb left. Zeb was kind of a lead guitar player as was Grady Martin, but Grady was the better player. So he got all the leads and Zeb played rhythm. When Jimmy took over, he played rhythm and sang some with Foley.”\nWith this basic lineup, augmented occasionally by other musicians, Foley would record some of his best-selling and most important records — continuing the style pioneered by the Cumberland Valley Boys. On Nov. 7, 1949, Foley began three days of historic sessions that would yield a total of eight Top 10 hits and many other classic recordings. The first day, Foley recorded five songs including two Top 10 hits — “I Gotta Have My Baby Back” and “Careless Kisses” — and what would become one of the biggest records of his career.\n“Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy” was a playful boogie composed by legendary songwriter and music publisher Fred Rose. In one of those notorious under-the-board song publishing deals, Rose signed over the writer’s credit to Opry managers Harry Stone and Jack Stapp — reportedly as a trade-off for their agreement to sign a young singer by the name of Hank Williams to the Opry. But Rose, being the smart businessman, retained the publishing through his company, Acuff-Rose Publishing. It would be a good deal for all concerned.\nOriginally titled “Boogie Woogie Shoe Shine Boy,” the song’s title was changed at the last minute to capitalize on the string of Volunteer State-related hits Foley had been having. (In the previous two years, “Tennessee Saturday Night,” “Tennessee Border,” “Tennessee Polka” and “Sunday Down in Tennessee,” had all been Top 10 hits.) Although Paul Cohen was still officially producer on the sessions, Owen Bradley had been assuming more control — working out arrangements and playing piano or organ as needed. Bradley had a definite sound in mind for “Chattanoogie.”\n“My brother had a dance band, and I was working with them,” Harold Bradley remembers. “There was a drummer named Farris Coursey. Owen and him were boyhood friends, and I lived next door to Farris. Owen came up to us in the hallway (at WSM) and said, ‘We’re going to do this song about a shoe shine boy — see if you can come up with a sound like a rag popping.’ We got to the session, and Farris came up with playing his thigh. Actually, he bruised one thigh and ended up on the other one.”\nAaron Shelton, one of the recording engineers and owners of Castle, also recalled the unique percussion section. “It took quite a long time to get a take to our satisfaction. Farris Coursey almost wore his leg out, beating on it to make the shoe shine noise.”\n“Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy” is an example of the proto-“Nashville Sound” at its finest. On the foundation of Farris Coursey’s thigh slapping, Owen Bradley’s austere but dead-on arrangement serves as the perfect showcase for Foley’s vocal performance. The reserved but precise interplay of Grady Martin’s and Billy Robinson’s solos give the song a hipness that still sounds fresh 50 years later. The song’s incredible success would lead to many cover versions — from Frank Sinatra to Bing Crosby. But a comparison of Crosby’s version to Foley’s demonstrates it really is “the singer not the song.” Foley is often compared to Crosby as a vocalist, but while “Der Bingle’s” “Shoe Shine Boy” may be smooth — Red’s swings.\nThe next day’s session concentrated on religious material for Decca Record’s new “Faith” series. The Faith series was to feature many popular artists performing religious songs, and the Decca executives wanted to include the label’s two main country stars, Red Foley and Ernest Tubb. Foley was no stranger to sacred material, having included many numbers in his live show for years. His performances on the Prince Albert Show always included at least at least one gospel song — a practice that had earned Foley a tremendous following not just with whites but also with blacks.\nFoley began the session recording with The Jordanaires on backing vocals. The gospel quartet had only recently joined the Opry, and this was some of their earliest session work. “Just A Closer Walk With Thee,” a Top 10 hit in July of 1950, and “When God Dips His Love In My Heart” were just two of the classic gospel songs Foley and The Jordanaires recorded that day. After spending most of the afternoon and evening recording, Foley finished the session’s gospel material with the recitation “Steal Away.” Performing the number with his eyes closed, the intensity of Foley’s performance reportedly left producer Paul Cohen, Ernest Tubb and Foley’s wife, Eva, in tears. The number would also become a Top 10 hit in May of 1950.\nDespite the lateness of the hour, the session continued with Foley switching from the sacred to the secular. Foley and Ernest Tubb laid down the first two of what would become a series of playful and very successful duets. “Tennessee Border No. 2” and “Don’t Be Ashamed of Your Age” would both be Top 10 hits in Janaury of 1950.\nFoley took the ninth of November 1949 off from the studio but returned just after midnight for an early morning session on the 10th, this time with a slightly different band. Hank Garland had gained a reputation as one of the hottest guitarists in Nashville, beginning with his spectacular debut on the Opry in 1945 at age of 15. After signing as a solo artist with Decca in the summer of 1949, Garland recorded “Sugarfoot Rag,” a hot, self-composed instrumental, in late August. Now Garland, just one day short of his 19th birthday, joined Foley to re-record the tune, with added lyrics written by Vaughn Horton. The resulting session yielded a swinging, sophisticated, hillbilly number that spotlighted both Foley’s unique vocal style and Garland’s impressive guitar playing.\n“Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy,” backed with “Sugarfoot Rag,” was released on January 23, 1950. “Chattanoogie” debuted on Billboard’s Country Singles chart the same week of its release and quickly shot to No. 1, spending 13 weeks at the top. It soon became apparent that the record wasn’t just selling to the usual country crowd when it crossed over to the Pop chart and ended up spending eight weeks in the top spot.\n“Sugarfoot Rag” proved to be more than just a B-side along for the ride. The song entered the country charts in its own right just four weeks after “Chattanoogie’s” debut. The song quickly rose, spending 20 weeks on the chart and reaching No. 4. It also crossed over to the pop charts, attaining No. 24.\nWhile Foley had been a steady hit maker for over five years, no one expected the incredible success of “Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy” and “Sugarfoot Rag.” It was a success that would not only affect Foley but also the members of his band.\n“I was only 19 at the time, and I was on top of the world,” Billy Robinson recalls. “After ‘Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy’ hit I was paid $50 a week not to record with anyone else. Looking back, I guess it was a mistake, but it seemed like a good deal at the time. Grady Martin didn’t take the deal, and he made a lot of money recording for other people.”\nBecause of the Prince Albert Show and his other radio commitments, Foley did little touring during this time period, but the success of the single pulled him onto the road for a number of appearances. “We did a big show in Chattanooga, and a local boy was picked to be the official ‘Shoe Shine Boy,'” Robinson says. “It was an incredible show.”\nThe success of “Sugarfoot Rag” also raised Hank Garland’s stock in the music scene. It would forever after be known as his signature tune, a fact that both Foley and Grady Martin respected. “Red would get Hank Garland to play ‘Sugarfoot Rag’ when he did it on the Opry because Grady wouldn’t do it,” Robinson recalls. “It wasn’t that Grady couldn’t play the part, but it was Hank’s tune.”\nFoley would go on to record many more hit records including “(There’ll Be) Peace In the Valley (For Me)” — the first million selling gospel record. He also would record several more hit duets with Ernest Tubb and later begin a series of successful duets with Kitty Wells. In 1954 Foley left Nashville for Springfield, Mo., where he hosted the Ozark Jubilee, the first network country music program, on ABC Television — a program that would help jumpstart the careers of many artists including Porter Wagoner, Brenda Lee and Billy Walker.\nBut along with the success, a series of tragedies haunted Foley through his life. Beginning with his first wife’s death in 1933 from childbirth, he would endure bad times along with the good. His second wife, Eva, would bear him three daughters, but she struggled with a heart condition and mental instability that would eventually lead to her taking her own life in 1951. Foley never completely recovered from Eva’s death and blamed himself since his own unfaithfulness had been tied to her suicide. Gradually, he began to drink more and more — a condition that was not helped when the IRS targeted him for tax evasion in the late ’50s. He would later be acquitted of all charges, but the fight left him broke and broken. After his election to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1967, Foley attempted to turn himself around. Shortly before his death he attempted to quit drinking and was determined to find the peace he had lost. He would pass away from congestive heart failure in his hotel room in Fort Wayne, Ind., on September 19, 1968, after performing that evening. “Peace in the Valley” was the last song Red Foley would ever sing.\nRed Foley left behind a legacy of incredibly innovative and influential recordings. While many other country artists would move in the direction of pop or borrow from the blues, Foley’s best recordings were a perfect mix of these elements while firmly remaining country — the sum being greater than the parts. In the mid-50s Elvis Presley, along with many other young rockers, would re-configure Red’s mixture of country, pop, and R&B into his own style. But when Presley turned his hand to gospel music, he would follow Foley’s lead almost exactly.\nTragically, few people remember Red Foley today or recognize the influence he had on other, more well-remembered singers. But the beauty of recordings is that as long as they exist, a performer is never truly dead, and their music and life can never truly be forgotten — but are merely waiting for rediscovery."", 'In the Jim Crow South, there were few opportunities for rural African-American men. “They really didn’t have anything else going,” says Clem. “They didn’t have any jobs . . . so when radio and records came around, they suddenly saw this opportunity . . . to make a living in a way they could enjoy and felt was meaningful, instead of working in the fields or whatever menial work they were offered. . . . They said, ‘Well, I can sing, I’ll get four guys together and yeah, let’s go.’” These circumstances brought together groups like the Dixie Hummingbirds, the Fairfield Four, the Blind Boys of Alabama, the Sensational Nightingales, the Skylarks, and more.\nQuartets would tour for months at a time, four or five men in one car, traveling from town to town, performing anywhere that would have them. “We spent a lotta nights, riding down the highway, eatin’ out of a paper sack,” remembered Isaac Freeman, who sang with the Fairfield Four, and passed away in 2012 at eighty-four. A common publicity strategy, known as “wildcatting,” was to drive to a town, knock on the door of the radio station, ask to sing on the radio, and give a live performance on the spot. Groups competed in quartet battles at churches, trying to outsing one another, in the hopes of being the group to “wreck the house,” and bring the crowd to a cheering frenzy. Not only churches, but schools, town halls, street corners, and barbershops became stages for these inventive performers.\nAccording to music scholar Jerry Zolten, the quartets “fine-tuned” the congregational spirituals that had been sung in American churches for decades. They brought gospel beyond jubilee-style singing (fast, restrained spirituals) and began to experiment: improvising, shouting, preaching, using falsettos, and moving freely with the energy and fervor of what became known as “hard gospel.” They began using guitars (gospel had previously been strictly a cappella) and writing their own songs as opposed to rearranging traditional spirituals. Many of the rhythms, harmonies, and stage theatrics first performed by gospel quartets at those church concerts and local radio shows would become the infrastructure of rhythm and blues, doo-wop, rock, and Motown.\nThe film reveals the unyielding discrimination gospel quartets faced during their careers in a segregated South. On tour, unable to stay at most hotels, eat at restaurants, or use gas stations, they often slept in their cars or stayed with church members. Groups tell of being pulled over and forced to spend nights in jail, or fined for fabricated offenses. Their struggles on the road influenced their musical message. Zolten adds, “Gospel music, while perhaps not directly intended to speak to race in America, the songs by their very nature were uplifting . . . [and] apply to the realities of situations that people were dealing with.”\nDespite its labor, gospel-singing was hardly profitable. Groups were often cheated by record executives, and relied on the budgets of churches and small venues. Clarence Fountain, now eighty-six, of the Blind Boys of Alabama—which he helped form as a student at Alabama School for the Negro Deaf and Blind—says they were told, “If you want to make money, go to rock ’n’ roll.” However, along with many of their peers, these performers continued singing gospel till the end of their careers, despite its less lucrative possibilities.\nSince the 1970s, the quartets have been pushed out of the spotlight. Considering the profit and fame in modern music rooted in gospel, longtime DJ Linwood Heath laments, “Somebody paid for that, somebody’s dues, somebody chopped the trees down and made the path.” How They Got Over tells a critical narrative of American musical genealogy: A story of people whose audacity made possible the music we listen to today. Clem says, “These people were really great singers, but also they were pioneers, going out on the road at this time . . . they were out there, uplifting people, telling them there was hope.”']"	['<urn:uuid:21a7c4b4-c490-485b-841d-77699b6339ee>', '<urn:uuid:320c979b-2861-45bd-9692-7a96ae5e6228>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	9	141	3477
29	first world war memorials tsarskoye selo washington dc differences honors	In Tsarskoye Selo, a monument '1914' was opened in 2018 featuring a bronze regimental priest blessing Russian soldiers, while in Washington DC, there was a marble gazebo memorial built in the 1930s that only honored DC veterans. Frank Buckles, the last U.S. WWI veteran, advocated for elevating the DC War Memorial's status to match honors given to WWII, Korea, and Vietnam veterans.	"['August 1, 2018, the anniversary of the First world war, in front of the Cathedral of St. Catherine in Tsarskoye Selo opened a monument “1914”, according to patriarhiei. The monument was consecrated by Bishop Markell of Tsarskoye Selo, assisted by the honorary Dean of the Pushkin district of St. Petersburg diocese, Archpriest Gennady Zverev.\nIn bronze, depicts the regimental priest blessing the Russian soldiers on a feat for the faith, Tsar and Fatherland. On the granite pedestal is an inscription in Roman numerals “MCMXIV” — 1914 , in niches, bronze bas-reliefs of St. George, the patron Saint of the Russian army, and the two-headed eagle — emblem of Russian Empire.\nVice-Governor Alexander Talkers at the opening ceremony of the monument noted that the year 1914 not only turned the country’s history, but also fundamentally changed the world, humanity: “Killed millions of people, military and civilian. The war was universal trouble, it kindled the fires of revolutions, provoked the collapse of four empires, gave rise to militarization around the world. There have been attempts to forget the war, its victims and consequences. But justice prevails, and in 2014, near the Vitebsk railway station was a monument to fallen soldiers. In Pushkin was opened by the Military chamber. Now there is another place of memory in Tsarskoye Selo was the chief of staff of Emperor Nicholas II, it housed hospitals, the dead are buried”.\n“Regimental priests did not take up arms, but he shared the hardships of the war, helped the wounded, bury the dead. Many of them died themselves, said Alexander Talkers. — This monument is a reminder of how fragile the world is and how easy it is to destroy it, if not to hear each other, that it is unacceptable to suppress the freedom and rights of someone in the name of their interests and ambitions.”\n“Prayer unites the invisible “I” and the invisible God, — the Lord told Markell. — It can be expressed in art, literature, sculpture, painting, and sculpture. Monument — a prayer for the dead”.\nThe Hierarch emphasized that the media provide a mixed picture of what is happening in the world, with an emphasis on the negative — disasters, diseases, catastrophes. “The problem of suffering is a deep mystery of God the mystery of life. Only through prayer we can touch the mystery, only through prayer we can understand many things, we can look beyond the visible horizon… God forbid we repeat past mistakes,” said the Archbishop.\nFounder and President of group of companies “Etalon”, the President of Fund “Creative world” Vyacheslav Zarenkov said that the monument was planned to deliver in 2014, by which time he was executed by the sculptor, but only today managed to implement. “The Tsar’s Village — a special place, hence the soldiers went to the First world war, — he reminded. Here brought dead, wounded, they recover not only in hospitals but also in monasteries. Not only the priests who were at the forefront and lead educational work among the soldiers, and monks who treated the wounded, contributed to the victory”.\nVyacheslav Zarenkov said that the memory of the First world war after the revolution was deliberately erased, because there were a lot of mistakes, and people who are in power do not want them to be seen. “I hope that this monument symbolizes the Union of faith clergy and laity, recalled the courage of the soldiers,” said said V. Zarenkov, saying that his grandfather died from gas poisoning in the war.\nThey read the greeting of the Chairman of the Russian historical society, Director of the foreign intelligence service Sergei Naryshkin.\nThe rector of the St. Petersburg Academy of arts named after Ilya Repin Semyon Mikhailovsky noted that the successfully chosen place for the monument — in front of the reconstructed temple. Sculptor, academician of the Russian Academy of ARTS Vladimir Gorevoy added that this monument we pay tribute to those who went to war and who prayed for the fighting.\nThe ceremony was attended by representatives of the government of St. Petersburg, legislative Assembly of the city, the administration of the Pushkin district.\nTo the monument and laid flowers, marched in solemn March of the honor guard.\n1 August (19 July Church calendar) — the day of Russia’s entry into the first world war in 1914. Tsarskoye Selo was the site of the quartering of regiments of the Imperial guard. During the great war, as it was then called the First world, the first guard joined in the battle at Causeni 6 August 1914. Since that time, guard units and participated in many battles and battles and suffered heavy losses. From the front for burial at Tsarskoye Selo brought the remains of the dead generals and officers; of the wounded soldiers — both officers and lower ranks — were sent to local hospitals. Just in Tsarskoye Selo during the war worked more than 60 hospitals. Tsarskoye Selo is the intention of the Emperor Nicholas II, had become a special place of remembrance of the First world war.', 'Washington (CNN) -- Frank Buckles, the last living U.S. World War I veteran, has died, a spokesman for his family said Sunday. He was 110.\nLawmakers Monday began to move ahead with proposed resolutions that would allow his casket to be displayed at the Capitol Rotunda, and plans were already in the works for his burial at Arlington National Cemetery.\nBuckles ""died peacefully in his home of natural causes"" early Sunday morning, the family said in a statement sent to CNN late Sunday by spokesman David DeJonge.\nBuckles marked his 110th birthday on February 1, but his family had earlier told CNN he had slowed considerably since last fall, according his daughter Susannah Buckles Flanagan, who lives at the family home near Charles Town, West Virginia.\nBuckles, who served as a U.S. Army ambulance driver in Europe during what was then known as the ""Great War,"" rose to the rank of corporal before the war ended.\nHis assignments included that of an escort for German prisoners of war. Little did he know he would someday become a prisoner of war during World War II.\nHe came to prominence in recent years, in part because of the work of DeJonge, a Michigan portrait photographer who had undertaken a project to document the last surviving veterans of that war.\nAs the years continued, all but Buckles had passed away, leaving him the ""last man standing"" among U.S. troops who were called ""The Doughboys."" His death leaves only two verified surviving WWI veterans in the world, both of whom are British.\nPresident Obama issued a statement Monday on Buckles\' passing, saying he and first lady Michelle Obama were ""inspired"" by Buckles\' story.\nFrank Buckles lived the American Century,"" Obama\'s statement said. ""Like so many veterans, he returned home, continued his education, began a career, and along with his late wife Audrey, raised their daughter Susannah. ... We join Susannah and all those who knew and loved her father in celebrating a remarkable life that reminds us of the true meaning of patriotism and our obligations to each other as Americans.""\nBuckles told CNN in 2007 he accepted the responsibility of honoring those who had gone before him, and to be their voice for permanent, national recognition after he was gone.\nDeJonge found himself the spokesman and advocate for Buckles in his mission to see to it that his comrades were honored with a monument on the National Mall, pushing for improvements to a neglected, obscure city memorial nearly in the shadow of the elaborate World War II memorial.\nBuckles wanted national status granted to the D.C. War Memorial, a marble gazebo built in the 1930s that, for now, honors only his comrades from the District of Columbia. His call was to elevate the designation of the site to join U.S. honors accorded to those who served in World War II, Korea and Vietnam.\n""We have come to the end of a chapter in history,"" said Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, a House sponsor of legislation to upgrade the DC War Memorial. ""Frank was the last American Doughboy -- a national treasure,"" Poe said in a statement provided to CNN.\nThe ""Frank Buckles WWI Memorial Act"" passed the House but had not cleared the Senate before Congress adjourned. Poe on Monday restated his support for a House resolution that would allow a public display for Buckles in the Capitol Rotunda. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-West Virginia is a co-sponsor of the Senate proposal.\nBuckles, at the age of 108, came to Capitol Hill from West Virginia in 2009 to testify before a Senate panel on behalf of the D.C. War Memorial bill. He sat alongside Rockefeller and fellow proponent Sens. John Thune, R-South Dakota, and Jim Webb, D-Virginia.\n""I have to,"" he told CNN when he came to Washington, as part of what he considered his responsibility to honor the memory of fellow veterans.\nRockefeller praised Buckles in a statement Monday, calling him ""a unique American, a wonderfully plain-spoken man, and an icon for the World War I generation.""\n""His life was full and varied and an inspiration for his unbridled patriotism and enthusiam for life,"" the statement said.\nBuckles, after World War I ended, took up a career as a ship\'s officer on merchant vessels. He was captured by the Japanese in the Philippines during World War II and held prisoner of war for more than three years before he was freed by U.S. troops.\nNever saying much about his POW experience, Buckles instead wanted attention drawn to the plight of the D.C. War Memorial. During a visit to the run-down, neglected site a few years ago, he went past the nearby World War II memorial without stopping, even as younger veterans stopped and saluted the old soldier in his wheelchair as he went by.\nRenovations to the structure began last fall, but Buckles, with his health already failing, could not make a trip to Washington to review the improvements. The National Park Service is overseeing efforts that include replacing a neglected walkway and dressing up a deteriorated dome and marble columns.\nDetails for services and arrangements will be announced in the days ahead, the family statement said.\nFlanagan, his daughter, said preliminary plans began weeks ago, with the Military District of Washington expressing its support for an honors burial at Arlington, including an escort platoon, a horse-drawn casket arrival, a band and a firing party.\n""It has long been my father\'s wish to be buried in Arlington, in the same cemetery that holds his beloved General (John) Pershing,"" Flanagan wrote as she began to prepare for the inevitable in a letter she sent to home-state U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia.\n""I feel confident that the right thing will come to pass,"" she said.\nManchin issued a statement Monday that read, in part, ""He lived a long and rich life as a true American patriot, and I hope that his family\'s loss is lightened with the knowledge that he was loved and will be missed by so many.""\nBuckles in 2008 attended Veterans Day ceremonies at the grave of Pershing, the commander of U.S. troops during World War I. He also met with then-President George W. Bush at the White House, and U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates at the Pentagon.\n""The First World War is not well understood or remembered in the United States,"" Gates said at the time. ""There is no big memorial on the National Mall. Hollywood has not turned its gaze in this direction for decades. Yet few events have so markedly shaped the world we live in.""\nBuckles\' family asks that donations be made to the National World War I Legacy Project to honor Frank Buckles and the 4,734,991 Americans with whom he served.\nMore than 116,000 Americans were killed, and more than 204,000 wounded, in the 19 months of U.S. involvement in the war, according to the Congressional Research Service.

NASA's program includes training flight surgeons and medical staff for space missions and space medicine, while Rendever focuses on training senior care staff to use VR technology to deliver therapeutic experiences and build connections with elderly residents.	"['About Kyle Rand & Rendever:\nKyle Rand is the co-founder and CEO of Rendever, a company pioneering virtual reality connectivity for seniors. He grew up volunteering at a senior living community and later went on to study cognitive decline in the aging population at Duke University.\nHe was recently named to Forbes 30 Under 30 and his company was just listed to Time’s list of 100 most influential companies in 2022, outstanding achievements both. When you meet him, you’ll understand why. His company has raised millions in funding pursuing a truly noble cause, empowering the elderly to form communities through virtual reality.\nIn case you didn’t know, loneliness and isolation are two of the biggest problems facing us as we age, and he’s found a life and career of meaning solving that challenge.\nFull Unedited Audio Conversation:\nKyle Rand & Rendever Links:\nIf you enjoy the show, please rate it 5 stars on Apple Podcasts, subscribe, and leave a nice review!\n2:40 – “At Rendever, as a company, we are on a mission to reduce social isolation through the power of positive shared experiences. And the primary way we do that is through virtual reality.”\n4:02 – “When you look at this demographics specifically, it’s really dangerous. We’re talking about a 30% increase in risk of hypertension and stroke, a 50% increase in risk of dementia, a lot of premature cognitive decline. We’re talking about immunosuppression, risk of infection goes up. We’re talking about even an increase in risk of diabetes…depression, anxiety, risk of suicide. All of these things together create a picture in which people have 30% higher mortality rates when they’re at a significant rate of social isolation.”\n5:29 – “The very first moment that always stuck with me was while I was volunteering at a community as a kid…We would go in and we’d scoop ice cream; it had an in-house ice cream parlor…and there’s this one day where this gentleman walked in and I locked eyes with him, I pointed at him and said, ‘You want rum raisin with chocolate sprinkles.’ And the smile that spread across his face in that little moment of recognition is something that just has stuck with me through this day.”\n7:27 – “As a society, we don’t have a healthy relationship with aging. We think about aging, we think about old people, we think about death, and we push it away. It’s not something that we want to lean into and talk about or think about. But it’s so odd because the two things that are guaranteed in our life is that we’re getting older, second by second, and at some point we’re going to die. If we don’t have the capacity to think about it, to have conversations about it, to ideate and think about how can we make that process better, knowing that that’s a process we’re all going to go through, then we’re not only selling the current demographic short, we’re also selling ourselves short.”\n8:11 – (Ross) “I live in the greater Los Angeles area, and you won’t go broke making a business that offers facial fillers, Botox, uplift, anything to make us look younger…It’s not just the Kardashians, but it’s anybody like them. Here’s what they posted on Instagram and here’s how they actually looked before it was so heavily edited and Photoshopped …what is presented on Instagram is essentially more of a painting than it is a photograph. But that’s the world where we all feel like we have to present this youthful image at all times and I’ve always taken issue with that. I’ve always felt that aging doesn’t have to be something that we have to fight. It can be something that we can embrace, but we don’t.”\n11:36 – “One of the things that…creates these situations in which it’s easy to call someone old is when technology comes into play. Someone is introduced to technology and they don’t get it, they get frustrated by it, they’re like, ‘Nah, that’s not for me.’ And that creates an immediate divide between people who are tech-adaptive and people who want to push away tech because it frustrates them and that’s so unfortunate, and it’s been really formative in how we’ve built this company… saying tech doesn’t have to be something that divides and creates an Us versus Them but actually can allow people to connect if it’s approached in the right way.”\n16:09 – [On the early days of VR] “What can we do with this technology? Can we use it? And everyone’s looking to kids, everyone’s looking at video games…And we took a step back and were like ‘Look, you think about this headset, you hold that up there, all of a sudden you can go anywhere in the world and you can do anything.’ Think about the aging demographic…no matter where they are in their aging process, who along each step, their access to the world becomes more and more limited. Think about the opportunity to all of a sudden reopen all those doors and expand their worlds. And we got super excited, and the moment we did our first set of demos, it became super clear that there is definitely magic to uncover here, and we had to turn to: ‘how do we actually make this work?’”\n19:22 – “One of my favorite stories is…there was one person who I think they were about to celebrate their 100th birthday and they had a plan where they were going to go skydiving…the resident got sick and wasn’t able to go – and what the staff member at her community did was say, ‘hey, we can do this in VR.’ And so strapped her into a Rendever headset, loaded up the skydiving experience and then counted down: 3, 2, 1, turned on a giant fan, the wind was blowing in her face…and it was amazing. It was magic.”\n21:32 – “Understanding who that human is, what their desires are, what their idea of purpose and passion, and the life that they want to live in that day, in that moment, is and then figuring out how to approach it, deliver it, enable them to experience what they want to experience and do so in a way that is building a bond…The experience is one thing but our approach as a company has been really to empower staff, volunteers, family members, anybody who is working with this population, to deliver magical moments. And through doing that, we’re inspiring connection to happen. And that’s really where the magic is.”\n29:08 – “We saw the impact. We saw just how significant it was when you put a headset on someone who might have spent months depressed, you bring them to Italy and this huge smile spreads across their face and they just light up.”\n31:34 – (Ross) “I’m glad that you’re able to pass that gratitude and humility on and instill those values in your company, because that’s so important. I’ve talked about values a lot with other people…if you’re building your own thing, why build the wrong values into it?…If you’re coming into somebody else’s thing, you don’t have a choice – you’ve got to follow their rules. But when you’re building your own thing, to recognize and reprioritize, that’s huge.”\n34:09 – “Since we don’t have the external pressure and since everything is so internal, what we’ve built is a company that is really high on gratitude. One of my favorite parts about our company is that we kickstart every single all-hands meeting with a kudos session where everybody just gives kudos to everybody. I think that the last meeting, it lasted a full 25 minutes. In an hour-and-a-half-long meeting, 25 minutes was people just delivering kudos to each other and expressing gratitude. And that’s really unique.”\n37:53 – “Our approach is so relationship driven that we are constantly getting partners, every single day, who will send us a note or send us a video or a photo of ways in which they’ve used Rendever to change somebody’s life. And then that obviously gets shared all over our internal Slack messages and it allows us to stay so close to the mission, and again, to wake up every single day and know without a doubt what we’re doing is making really significant positive impact and you can remove everything else – that makes life a ten.”\n43:25 – [On a story from a Rendever partner] “They had a stage four pancreatic cancer patient who spent her whole life involved in music…We need to figure out how to bring her something unique. And so we partnered with the Colorado Symphony and went on stage at Red Rocks Amphitheatre, filmed the entire symphony experience during sunset at Red Rocks, and then brought this patient as the first person to get to experience it. And it was unforgettable. At one point, she said, ‘Music has always been my medicine.’ And one of the hardest parts about navigating this journey is her access to being able to experience live music is just totally cut and to be able to put on a headset and all of a sudden be on stage at one of the most spectacular music venues in the entire world with the Colorado Symphony. It was just it was incredible.”\n47:02 – “We found that after just two weeks of daily shared experiences in Rendever our participants had statistically significant decreases in their depression scores and increases in multiple measures of social health. Most interestingly, people actually started to trust each other more. When we think about what it means to build a relationship, one of the fundamental elements is trust…This isn’t just people having fun together using technology. This is people who are presented with a unique opportunity to really, authentically, genuinely connect. And they’re taking it and they’re running with it.”\n49:10 – “As an early entrepreneur, everybody wanted to give advice. The advice to everybody is: you’re not the first person to do something. Go out there, figure out who did what? What can you learn from? While there’s truth to that, I think the thing that I really stuck to as an early entrepreneur was: everyone has advice, but that advice is 100% informed by their personal experiences. And if you take somebody’s advice without actively figuring out how big of a grain of salt you need to put on that piece of advice, you’re going to be sent in every single which way direction…If you’re fully confident what you’re doing and the approach you have in your why, then take as much advice as you can, but understand that you need to be adding grains of salt to all of it.”\n51:09 – [Advice to care-givers] “One of the things that is tough to navigate is caregiver guilt and caregiver burden. You experience these things hand-in-hand as your duties as a caregiver go up. Whether or not you’re alone, you have help with home care, you have a loved one in senior living…Remember that it’s a relationship they you are a part of. It’s really easy to get wrapped up in the caregiving side of the relationship but there is another element to that relationship. Figure out how to set up time/space opportunities to be a part of the relationship as it exists outside of your caregiver duties. And that makes everything better.”', 'incisive articles on\n(Photo courtesy of NASA JSC Aerospace Medicine Clerkship, October 2018), Above left, Dr. Jennifer Ma sits at the controls of the NASA Orion spacecraft training mockup with a fellow clerkship team member.

32	My doctor found a tumor in my pituitary gland. Can these types of tumors be removed without making a big cut in my head?	Yes, pituitary tumors can typically be removed by a neurosurgeon through the nose. This is one of the surgical treatment options for Cushing syndrome when it's caused by a pituitary tumor.	"[""Cushing syndrome occurs when your body is exposed to high levels of the hormone cortisol for a long time. The most common cause of Cushing syndrome, sometimes called hypercortisolism, is the use of oral corticosteroid medication. The condition can also occur when your body makes too much cortisol.\nToo much cortisol can produce some of the hallmark signs of Cushing syndrome — a fatty hump between your shoulders, a rounded face, and pink or purple stretch marks on your skin. Cushing syndrome can also result in high blood pressure, bone loss and, on occasion, diabetes.\nTreatments for Cushing syndrome can return your body's cortisol production to normal and noticeably improve your symptoms. The earlier treatment begins, the better your chances for recovery.\nThe signs and symptoms of Cushing syndrome vary.\nCommon signs and symptoms involve progressive obesity and skin changes, such as:\n- Weight gain and fatty tissue deposits, particularly around the midsection and upper back, in the face (moon face), and between the shoulders (buffalo hump)\n- Pink or purple stretch marks (striae) on the skin of the abdomen, thighs, breasts and arms\n- Thinning, fragile skin that bruises easily\n- Slow healing of cuts, insect bites and infections\nWomen with Cushing syndrome may experience:\n- Thicker or more visible body and facial hair (hirsutism)\n- Irregular or absent menstrual periods\nMen with Cushing syndrome may experience:\n- Decreased libido\n- Decreased fertility\n- Erectile dysfunction\nOther signs and symptoms include:\n- Muscle weakness\n- Depression, anxiety and irritability\n- Loss of emotional control\n- Cognitive difficulties\n- New or worsened high blood pressure\n- Glucose intolerance that may lead to diabetes\n- Bone loss, leading to fractures over time\nWhen to see a doctor\nIf you're taking corticosteroid medications to treat a condition, such as asthma, arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, and experience signs and symptoms that may indicate Cushing syndrome, see your doctor for an evaluation. Even if you're not using these drugs and you have symptoms that suggest the possible presence of Cushing syndrome, contact your doctor.\nCushing syndrome results from excess levels of the hormone cortisol in your body. Your endocrine system consists of glands that produce hormones that regulate processes throughout your body. These glands include the adrenal glands, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, pancreas, ovaries (in females) and testicles (in men).\nYour adrenal glands produce a number of hormones, including cortisol. Cortisol plays a variety of roles in your body. For example, cortisol helps regulate your blood pressure and keeps your cardiovascular system functioning normally. It also helps your body respond to stress and regulates the way you convert (metabolize) proteins, carbohydrates and fats in your diet into usable energy. However, when the level of cortisol is too high in your body, you may develop Cushing syndrome.\nThe role of corticosteroids\nCushing syndrome can develop from a cause that originates outside of your body (exogenous Cushing syndrome). Taking corticosteroid medications in high doses over an extended period of time may result in Cushing syndrome. These medications, such as prednisone, have the same effects as does the cortisol produced by your body.\nYour doctor may prescribe corticosteroids to treat inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and asthma, or to prevent your body from rejecting a transplanted organ. Because the doses required to treat these conditions are often higher than the amount of cortisol your body normally needs each day, the effects of excess cortisol can occur.\nPeople can also develop Cushing syndrome from injectable corticosteroids — for example, repeated injections for joint pain, bursitis and back pain. While certain inhaled steroid medicines (taken for asthma) and steroid skin creams (used for skin disorders such as eczema) are in the same general category of drugs, they're less likely to cause Cushing syndrome, but may in some individuals especially if taken in high doses.\nYour body's own overproduction\nThe condition may also be due to your body's own overproduction of cortisol (endogenous Cushing syndrome). This may occur from excess production by one or both adrenal glands, or overproduction of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which normally regulates cortisol production. In these cases, Cushing syndrome may be related to:\n- A pituitary gland tumor (pituitary adenoma). A noncancerous (benign) tumor of the pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain, secretes an excess amount of ACTH, which in turn stimulates the adrenal glands to make more cortisol. When this form of the syndrome develops, it's called Cushing disease. It occurs much more often in women and is the most common form of endogenous Cushing syndrome.\n- An ectopic ACTH-secreting tumor. Rarely, when a tumor develops in an organ that normally does not produce ACTH, the tumor will begin to secrete this hormone in excess, resulting in Cushing syndrome. These tumors, which can be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant), are usually found in the lungs, pancreas, thyroid or thymus gland.\n- A primary adrenal gland disease. In some people, the cause of Cushing syndrome is excess cortisol secretion that doesn't depend on stimulation from ACTH and is associated with disorders of the adrenal glands. The most common of these disorders is a noncancerous tumor of the adrenal cortex, called an adrenal adenoma. Cancerous tumors of the adrenal cortex (adrenocortical carcinomas) are rare, but they can cause Cushing syndrome as well. Occasionally, benign, nodular enlargement of both adrenal glands can result in Cushing syndrome.\n- Familial Cushing syndrome. Rarely, people inherit a tendency to develop tumors on one or more of their endocrine glands, affecting cortisol levels and causing Cushing syndrome.\nIf you don't receive prompt treatment for Cushing syndrome, other complications may occur, such as:\n- Bone loss (osteoporosis), which can result in unusual bone fractures, such as rib fractures and fractures of the bones in the feet\n- High blood pressure (hypertension)\n- Frequent or unusual infections\n- Loss of muscle mass and strength\nWhen the cause of Cushing syndrome is a pituitary tumor (Cushing disease), it can sometimes lead to other problems, such as interfering with the production of other hormones controlled by the pituitary.\nYou're likely to start by seeing your family doctor or a general practitioner. However, in some cases when you call to set up an appointment, you may be referred immediately to an endocrinologist, a doctor who specializes in endocrine (hormonal) disorders.\nIt's a good idea to prepare for your appointment so that you can make the most of your time with your doctor. Here's some information to help you get ready, and what to expect from your doctor.\nWhat you can do\n- Be aware of any pre-appointment restrictions. At the time you make the appointment, be sure to ask if there's anything you need to do in advance to prepare for diagnostic tests.\n- Write down any symptoms you're experiencing, including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment. For example, if you've had headaches more frequently or if you've been feeling down or more tired than usual, this is important information to share with your doctor. Also tell your doctor about changes in your physical appearance, such as weight gain, new acne or increased body hair.\n- Write down key personal information, including any changes in your personal relationships and in your sex life. Let your doctor know if the people closest to you have noticed that you seem irritable or that you seem to have more mood swings than in the past. It may help to take along a photo of yourself that shows any changes in your physical appearance since you've started experiencing symptoms.\n- Make a list of all medications, as well as any vitamins, creams or supplements, that you're currently taking or have used in the past. Include on your list the specific name, dose and dates of any steroid medications you've taken in the past, such as cortisone injections.\n- Take a family member or friend along, if possible. Sometimes it can be difficult to soak up all the information provided to you during an appointment. Someone who accompanies you may remember something that you missed or forgot.\n- Write down questions to ask your doctor.\nYour time with your doctor is limited, so preparing a list of questions will help you make the most of your time together. List your questions from most important to least important in case time runs out. For Cushing syndrome, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:\n- What is likely causing my symptoms or condition?\n- Are there other possible causes for my symptoms or condition?\n- What kinds of diagnostic tests do I need? How are these tests performed?\n- What are my treatment options?\n- Will my physical signs and symptoms improve with treatment? Will I see a difference in my appearance as well as in the way I feel?\n- Will treatment help make me feel more emotionally stable?\n- What long-term impact could each treatment option have? Will there be an impact on my ability to have children?\n- How will you follow my response to treatment over time?\n- Are there any alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?\n- I have these other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?\n- Are there any restrictions that I need to follow?\n- Should I see a specialist?\n- Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing?\n- Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can take home with me? What websites do you recommend?\nIn addition to the questions that you've prepared to ask your doctor, don't hesitate to ask questions during your appointment.\nWhat to expect from your doctor\nYour doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may reserve time to go over any points you want to spend more time on. Your doctor may ask:\n- When did you first begin experiencing symptoms?\n- Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional? Have they gotten worse over time?\n- Have you noticed any changes in your sexual performance or your interest in sex?\n- For women, has your menstrual cycle changed or have you stopped having your period?\n- Have you gained weight? On what part of your body?\n- Have you had difficulty controlling your emotions?\n- Have you noticed that you bruise more easily, or that wounds and infections take longer to heal than in the past?\n- Do you have weakness in your muscles, such as difficulty getting out of the tub or walking stairs?\n- Have you developed new acne or more body or facial hair?\n- Have you been taking a corticosteroid medication? For how long?\n- What, if anything, seems to either improve or worsen your symptoms?\nDiagnosing Cushing syndrome can be a long and extensive process. You may not have any firm answers about your condition until you've had a series of medical appointments.\nTreatments for Cushing syndrome are designed to lower the high level of cortisol in your body. The best treatment for you depends on the cause of the syndrome. Treatment options include:\nReducing corticosteroid use. If the cause of Cushing syndrome is long-term use of corticosteroid medications, your doctor may be able to keep your Cushing signs and symptoms under control by reducing the dosage of the drug over a period of time, while still adequately managing your asthma, arthritis or other condition. For many of these medical problems, your doctor can prescribe noncorticosteroid drugs, which will allow him or her to reduce the dosage or eliminate the use of corticosteroids altogether.\nDon't reduce the dose of corticosteroid drugs or stop taking them on your own. Do so only under your doctor's supervision. Abruptly discontinuing these medications could lead to deficient cortisol levels. Slowly tapering off corticosteroid drugs allows your body to resume normal cortisol production.\nSurgery. If the cause of Cushing syndrome is a tumor, your doctor may recommend complete surgical removal. Pituitary tumors are typically removed by a neurosurgeon, who may perform the procedure through your nose. If a tumor is present in the adrenal glands, lungs or pancreas, the surgeon can remove it through a standard operation or in some cases by using minimally invasive surgical techniques, with smaller incisions.\nAfter the operation, you'll need to take cortisol replacement medications to provide your body with the correct amount of cortisol. In most cases, you'll eventually experience a return of normal adrenal hormone production, and your doctor can taper off the replacement drugs. However, this process can take up to a year or longer. In some instances, people with Cushing syndrome never experience a resumption of normal adrenal function; they then need lifelong replacement therapy.\n- Radiation therapy. If the surgeon can't totally remove a pituitary tumor, he or she will usually prescribe radiation therapy to be used in conjunction with the operation. Additionally, radiation may be used for people who aren't suitable candidates for surgery. Radiation can be given in small doses over a six-week period or by a technique called stereotactic radiosurgery (Gamma Knife surgery). In the latter procedure, administered as a single treatment, a large dose of radiation is delivered to the tumor, and the radiation exposure to surrounding tissues is minimized.\nMedications. Medications can be used to control cortisol production when surgery and radiation don't work. Medications may also be used before surgery in people who have become very sick with Cushing syndrome. Doctors recommend drug therapy before surgery to improve signs and symptoms and minimize surgical risk. Medications to control excessive production of cortisol include ketoconazole (Nizoral), mitotane (Lysodren) and metyrapone (Metopirone). The Food and Drug Administration has also approved the use of mifepristone (Korlym) for people with Cushing syndrome who have type 2 diabetes or glucose intolerance. Mifepristone does not decrease cortisol production, but it blocks the effect of cortisol on your tissues.\nIn some cases, the tumor or its treatment will cause other hormones produced by the pituitary or adrenal gland to become deficient and your doctor will recommend hormone replacement medications.\nIf none of these treatment options is effective, your doctor may recommend surgical removal of your adrenal glands (bilateral adrenalectomy). This procedure will cure excess production of cortisol. However, your ACTH levels will remain high, possibly causing excess pigmentation of your skin.\nThe length of your recovery from Cushing syndrome will depend on the severity and cause of your condition. Remember to be patient. You didn't develop Cushing syndrome overnight, and your symptoms won't disappear overnight either. In the meantime, these tips may help you on your journey back to health.\n- Increase activities slowly. You may be in such a hurry to get your old self back that you push yourself too hard too fast, but your weakened muscles need a slower approach. Work up to a reasonable level of exercise or activity that feels comfortable without overdoing it. You'll improve little by little, and your persistence will be rewarded.\n- Eat sensibly. Nutritious, wholesome foods provide a good source of fuel for your recovering body and can help you lose the extra pounds that you gained from Cushing syndrome. Make sure you're getting enough calcium and vitamin D. Taken together, they help your body absorb calcium, which can help strengthen your bones, counteracting the bone density loss that often occurs with Cushing syndrome.\n- Monitor your mental health. Depression can be a side effect of Cushing syndrome, but it can also persist or develop after treatment begins. Don't ignore your depression or wait it out. Seek help promptly from your doctor or a therapist if you're depressed, overwhelmed or having difficulty coping during your recovery.\n- Gently soothe aches and pains. Hot baths, massages and low-impact exercises, such as water aerobics and tai chi, can help alleviate some of the muscle and joint pain that accompanies Cushing syndrome recovery.\n- Exercise your brain. If you're recovering from any cognitive difficulties as a result of Cushing syndrome, mental exercises, such as math problems and crossword puzzles, may improve your brain function.\nSupport groups can be valuable in dealing with Cushing syndrome and recovery. They bring you together with other people who are coping with the same kinds of challenges, along with their families and friends, and offer a setting in which you can share common problems.\nAsk your doctor about support groups in your community. Your local health department, public library and telephone book as well as the Internet also may be good sources to find a support group in your area.\nMar. 28, 2013\n- Stratakis CA.

33	monofilament line water absorption strength effects	Monofilament fishing line weakens significantly due to water absorption. After just one hour in water, monofilament line loses an average of 15% of its strength, and the loss can be as high as 20%. For example, a knot with 90% strength using 10-pound test line that starts with 9 pounds of strength when dry could end up with only about 7 pounds of strength after an hour of fishing. This is different from fluorocarbon or braided line, which don't suffer from this weakness.	['Fishing Knot Rules\n20 Ways to Avoid Knot Failure\nBy Vincent A. LaZara\nAs the saying goes, “The knot in your line is the weakest link between you and your bass.” Losing a bass that makes a mighty leap and throws your hook can be frustrating, but having one break off your knot is just infuriating. Considering the importance of choosing and correctly tying the right fishing knot, it is surprising how little information is devoted to the topic in bass fishing articles and television fishing shows. Even the various books l have read about bass fishing cover only the basics about fishing knots and knot tying, with no significant depth on the topic. This article is intended to remedy the situation.\nA fishing knot can never be any better than the line used to tie it. So before getting into the specifics about knots, consider the following general precautions to take about the line itself.\nFirst, use only premium brands of fishing line, to ensure your line is high in quality and correctly labeled for important characteristics like pound-test ratings and line diameter.\nSecond, store spare spools of line in a sealed, dry container and place it in a dark, cool place to avoid deterioration.\nThird, continually inspect the line on your reels and replace it when it shows any signs of wear, damage, or abrasion.\nFinally, cut off leaders made of nylon line (typically called monofilament) that have been in the water for any significant length of time, and switch reels or reel spools when longer sections of monofilament line are involved. Unlike fluorocarbon line or braided line, monofilament line will weaken due to water absorption. After only one hour in the water, its average loss in strength is fifteen percent and could be as high as twenty percent. So, a knot with ninety percent of line strength tied with ten-pound test line that starts out with about nine pounds of strength when dry could end up with only about seven pounds of strength after an hour’s fishing. And since monofilament is typically used with top-water presentations, an added benefit is that fresh line has greater buoyancy than when water logged.\nThere are two causes of knot failure: Slippage and breakage. Slippage can occur for two reasons: Tying the wrong fishing knot for the type of line in use, or improperly tying the right knot. Breakage also can occur for two reasons: Strain on the knot exceeds knot strength, or improperly tying the knot causes it to break under strain that does not exceed potential knot strength.\nBass anglers can go a long way towards preventing knot slippage and breakage by adhering to the following rules.\n- Select a knot that will not slip with the chosen line. Some knots that work well with monofilament and fluorocarbon line will slip with braided line. Some fishing line manufacturers recommend knots; check out their websites.\n- Select a strong knot for the purpose you have in mind (line to lure, line to line, etc.) Do not settle for a knot because it simply is familiar or popular. Focus on knots that rate at least ninety percent of line strength. Google “fishing knots” and review a variety of different knots to check out their strength ratings. Also, check out the results from “Knot Wars” at http://video.fishingclub.com/pages/knot-wars for tests of the comparative strength of a wide variety of knots.\n- Select a knot that you repeatedly can tie correctly on the water. Some knots, while very strong, are too complex. You would have a difficult time tying them correctly under field conditions such as wind, rain, cold, and low light, or when pressured by circumstances to tie speedily.\n- Select a versatile knot. For example, the Uniknot is a multipurpose knot that can be used for attaching line to hook, lure, or swivel (passing the line twice through the eye of the hook is the improved Uniknot or Fishin’ Fool knot.) The Uni is also good for attaching line to line of similar diameter, attaching line to reel spool, and even snelling a hook. With a versatile knot, you do not have to remember and become skilled at tying a different knot for every purpose. However versatile the knot, you still may need to learn other knots for other purposes. To tie directly to certain lures instead of using a split ring or snap (see below), you will need to learn a loop knot. To connect lines of very dissimilar diameters, you may need to use an Albright knot or an Improved Blood knot. And if you fly-fish, you may need to tie a nail knot to connect your fly line to your leader.\n- Before attempting to tie your chosen knot on the water, practice tying it at home with the same line used when fishing. You will develop techniques enabling you to tie it quickly and accurately. Continue practicing until you can tie the knot almost without thinking about what you are doing. Line used up this way is a worthwhile investment in the prevention of knot slippage and breakage.\n- Lubricate knots before tightening to reduce friction. Friction creates heat that weakens monofilament and fluorocarbon lines, thereby causing knot breakage. Many anglers use saliva or water as their lubricant. For an exceptionally smooth snug-down, first moisten the line and wraps with a tiny dab of liquid floatant gel used on dry flies by fly fishermen.\n- After a knot is tightened, pull the main line, gradually putting some pressure on the knot to assure it is tied correctly. If it is not, it is far better that it slip apart or break in your hands instead of when your trophy bass is at the end of the line.\n- When cutting off tag ends, be careful not to nick knots by trimming too close. Also, use a line cutter or scissors made for the type of line being used to avoid putting undue strain upon the knot. Such tools are available from a number of tackle manufacturers. Never use your teeth to cut line because doing so causes excessive dental wear and could result in chipped teeth.\n- If you use your teeth as a ”third hand” when tying a knot, to avoid damaging the line or knot, do not bite down on the main line or any portion of the line that will go into the knot. The only part of the line you should bite down on is the tag end that will be trimmed off. Also, if you tug on line held in your teeth, be very careful about putting too much pressure on your teeth to avoid damaging them.\n- Do a visual inspection of each knot to be sure all the wraps are correctly laid out next to one another. Overlapping wraps can put undue pressure on an underlying wrap causing a knot to break under a strain far short of its pound test rating. If a knot looks odd, most likely it was not tied properly. Cut it off and retie.\n- When using monofilament and fluorocarbon line with a strength rating lower than ten-pound test, take more care when tying, lubricating, tightening, and inspecting your knots. Due to the inherently lower strength of light line and the fact that knots have even less strength than the line’s test strength to begin with, it is especially important not to risk any avoidable weakness. Also, be aware that braided line below twenty-pound test (typically, the equivalent monofilament diameter being six-pound test) is so thin that knots tied with it require more care to inspect adequately compared to thicker lines of thirty to sixty-five pound test.\n- Whenever possible, pre-tie knots before going on location to avoid tying subject to the difficulties of field conditions. For example, if you are drop-shotting, split-shotting, or Caroling rigging, you can pre-tie leaders from the swivel on down with any needed hooks, sinkers, and trailing line. Then you can store your pre-tied leaders in the compartments of a leader wallet or the bags of a small worm binder. Different styles and sizes of leader storage systems are manufactured by Shimano, Plano, and Daiwa. Then, when you need to replace a leader, you can cut it off on the main line side of the swivel and quickly tie your main line to the swivel of the pre-tied leader, eliminating the need to tie any other knots on location.\n- Rig your terminal tackle using as few knots as combinations of lines and different fishing techniques require. Every knot between your reel and your bass is a potential point of failure in spite of your precautions.\n- If your rod tip guide has a ridge of metal like hard chromium, replace it with a guide that has an insert of material such as chromium oxide, Alconite ®, or Hardloy ®. This will protect line-to-line knots using monofilament or fluorocarbon line by reducing both friction and impact damage that occur every time the knot is dragged over the plain metal rim while under the pressure of fighting a fish.\n- When attaching line to a split ring, be sure the knot is not tightened in the ring’s split, but instead on the opposite side of the split. Otherwise, the sharp edges of the ring where it opens up may weaken the knot by nicking or even cutting into it. Since fighting or playing a bass may shift the position of a knot to the opening in the split ring, it is necessary to regularly inspect a knot’s location on the split ring. Alternatively, there are two ways you can avoid the hazard of the split in the ring altogether and still retain the lure’s ability to move side to side upon retrieve. Either remove the split ring and tie the line directly to the lure using a loop knot, or else tie the line to a snap, which has the added benefit of facilitating quick lure changes.\n- Protect knots from weakening due to strain and abrasion. Once a bass is removed from the water, the buoyant force of the water no longer counteracts the bass’s weight. So lift fish from the water with a net instead of hoisting them out of the water with your line to avoid placing unnecessary strain on your knots. Also, keep bullet weights from bumping into your knots by separating them from the weights using a glass bead with smoothed edges around the center hole to prevent abrasion. As an added precaution, such a bead can be held in place next to a knot with a bobber stopper anytime the knot will be dragged over structure or pulled through cover that might damage it.\n- When using a trailing line as in drop-shotting, attach the weight to the end of the line using a weaker knot than the knot tied to the hook. That way, if you must break off because the weight gets hung up in rocks or wood, you can save your hook and lure while not placing excessive strain on the hook knot. Depending on your chosen knot, you may be able to weaken the trailer knot simply by using far fewer wraps, say one or two wraps instead of six or seven with a Uniknot, thereby avoiding the need to learn a different knot for this purpose.\n- After each catch, visually inspect your knots. If a knot shifted on the eye of the hook or tie point of a lure during the fight with the fish, readjust it. Also, retie if a knot looks odd in any way, since the position of knot wraps can alter under the strain of the twists and turns placed on a knot when fighting a fish.\n- Retie knots periodically, even if they look fine, because they may be weakened by the strains placed on them in the normal course of fishing. Retie after landing an especially large bass, catching a series of moderate sized bass, or even after pulling a smaller bass through thick weeds. The lower the pound test of the line, the more critical it is to retie in such situations. For example, a knot of ninety percent line test strength tied with eight-pound test line has only about seven pounds of strength to begin with. Diminish that with the weakening due to strain and the remaining knot strength may be inadequate for your next catch.\n- Do not put more strain on the knot than it can handle based on its strength. If you are using twenty-pound test line and tie on a knot with ninety percent of line test strength, do not exceed eighteen pounds of strain. Check the reel manufacturer’s guide-book on how to set the drag and always set the drag to account for the strength of your weakest knot instead of the strength of the line.\nI have had only one knot fail in the past two years of following these rules. In my haste to retie and cast to some actively feeding bass, I violated rule number seven, which resulted in knot slippage. So I am confident that bass anglers tying fishing knots according to the precepts listed above will experience far fewer, if any, knot failures.\nAbout the Author\nVince LaZara is a retired college professor who angles avidly for largemouth bass on a regular basis in various lakes in southeastern Arizona.']	['<urn:uuid:ff76aa90-8566-4a90-a823-917e284182a7>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	6	83	2237
34	I've been reading about missile technology and wanted to know what's different about how the Pukguksong-2 and Musudan missiles are powered - can you explain the main differences in their fuel systems?	The Pukguksong-2 and Musudan use different propulsion systems. The Pukguksong-2 uses a two-stage, solid propellant system, which allows it to be fired quickly after receiving a launch order since it doesn't need to be fueled before launch. In contrast, the Musudan uses a liquid propellant system with more advanced propellants - specifically unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (UDMH) and nitrogen tetroxide (NTO), which are more sophisticated than the kerosene compounds used in other North Korean missiles.	['The Pukguksong-2 (KN-15) is a cold-launched, medium-range ballistic missile, and appears to be a land-based variant of the KN-11, North Korea’s submarine-launched ballistic missile.\nPukguksong-2 at a Glance\nOriginated From: North Korea\nPossessed By: North Korea\nAlternate Names: Pukkuksong-2, Pukkuksong-2, KN-15, Bukkeunkseong-2, KN-11 Mod 1\nClass: Medium-range Ballistic Missile (MRBM)\nBasing: Road mobile, tracked transporter-erector launcher\nLength: 9-12 m\nDiameter: ~1.5 m\nPayload: Single warhead, HE or nuclear\nPropulsion: Two-stage, solid propellant, cold-launched\nRange: 1,200-2,000 km\nIn Service: 2018-2019\nKN-15 performed its first flight test on February 12, 2017, although North Korea has been conducting flight tests of KN-11 since May 2015.\nTo date, little has been confirmed concerning the exact capabilities of the KN-15. In its February 2017 flight test, the missile flew 500 km, and reached a maximum altitude of 550 km, a nearly identical trajectory to the KN-11’s successful flight test in August 2016. This lofted trajectory has led analysts to contend that KN-15 could have a maximum range of between 1,200 and 2,000 km when fired along a more depressed trajectory. 1 2\nThe missile also employs a solid-fueled engine, which would allow for the missile to be fired shortly after receiving a launch order as it does not need to be fueled prior to launch. Solid-fuel missiles also require far fewer support vehicles and personnel, increasing their operational flexibility. Currently, the only other solid-fuel missile in North Korea’s ballistic missile arsenal is the short-range KN-02.\nAdditionally, the missile uses a cold-launch system, which uses high pressure steam to propel the missile out of the launch canister into the air before the missile’s engines ignite. This allows for the launch canister to be reused.\nThe KN-15 test was also noteworthy because it was launched from a tracked transporter erector launcher (TEL), reminiscent of older, Soviet-designed launchers. This differs from North Korea’s other road mobile missiles which use wheeled TELs and are mostly limited to operating on paved or otherwise relatively smooth roads. The addition of a tracked TEL greatly adds to the missile’s survivability, as it can be fired from hidden, off-road sites. This capability is particularly well-suited for North Korea, which has only around 700 km of paved road throughout the country. 3\nThe TEL used in the test is believed to have been produced in North Korea, which suggests that the nation has turned to producing its own launchers as it can no longer purchase Chinese or Russian ones due to arms embargoes. 4\n|May 21, 2017||1||Distance traveled: 500 km; apogee: 560 km.|\n|February 12, 2017||1||Distance traveled: 500 km; apogee: 550 km.|\nAllegations have also been made that the KN-15 bears a great deal of similarity to the JL-1 and DF-21 missiles, and could have been produced from transferred Chinese technology. 5 The allegations cite the KN-15’s rapid development time frame and its physical similarity. Physical characteristics, however, may not be a reliable indicator of the missile’s source, given the physical similarities of SLBMs in general, and solid-fueled missile more broadly. Moreover, the KN-15 appears to use a single engine, and employs grid fins for stability, whereas the JL-1 employs four engines, and no grid fins.6\nOn May 21, 2017, North Korea carried out a second successful test launch of the KN-15. The missile was launched from the country of Pukchang, flying 500 km eastward, climbing to an altitude of 560 km before falling into the sea.\nA 2019 United Nations report indicated that North Korea has deployed the KN-15 at its northern missile bases. 7', 'The BM-25 Musudan is a single-stage intermediate-range ballistic missile. It is speculated to have a range of 2,500 – 4,000 km with a 500 kg – 1,200 kg payload – enough range to hold bases in Guam and Japan at risk.\nMusudan at a Glance\nOriginated From: North Korea\nPossessed By: North Korea, Iran\nAlternate Names: Mirim, No Dong B, BM-25\nClass: Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM)\nBasing: Road-mobile, Ground-launched\nLength: 12.0 m\nDiameter: 1.5-2.0 m\nLaunch Weight: 19,000-26,000 kg\nPayload: Single warhead, 500-1,200 kg\nWarhead: HE or nuclear\nPropulsion: One or two-stage liquid propellant\nRange: 2,500-4,000 km\nThe Musudan is based on the Soviet R-27 ‘Serb’ SLBM missile which uses a 4D10 engine propelled by unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (UDMH) and nitrogen tetroxide (NTO). These propellants are much more advanced than the kerosene compounds used in North Korea’s Scuds and No Dong missiles, giving the Musudan its greater range without enlarging the missile.1 Reports suggest that Iran purchased 18 Musudan missile sets from North Korea in 2005. In 2009, additional reports arose in regards to a North Korea and Iran missile linkage, indicating that Musudan parts were transferred to Iran.2\nThe missile specifications vary widely: length ranges from 12.0 to 19.0 m; the body diameter is 1.5 to 2.0 m; launch weight is 19,000 to 26,000 kg; and the range is 2,500 to 4,000 km. The missile is expected to have a single warhead with a payload of 1,200 kg. It uses a one or two-stage liquid propellant. The guidance is inertial with an accuracy of 1,600 m CEP.\nOn April 15, 2016 North Korea attempted a flight test of its BM-25 Musudan missile, which failed. Pentagon officials called it a “fiery, catastrophic attempt at a launch. It was not successful.”3 The Washington Post cited one member of South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff as saying, “North Korea appears to have tried a missile launch from the East Sea (Sea of Japan) area early morning today, but it is presumed to have failed.”4 Despite the failure, this test was a significant event, demonstrating the Musudan’s advancement from what was once believed to be a mock-up for propaganda purposes to a functioning, testable missile.5\n|October 19, 2016||1||Failed upon launch.|\n|October 15, 2016||1||Failed.|\n|June 22, 2016||2||First missile traveled 150 km before breaking up mid-air. Second missile traveled 400 km, reaching apogee of 1,000 km.|\n|May 31, 2016||1||Exploded on the launch pad.|\n|April 28, 2016||2||First missile crashed within seconds after launch. Second missile traveled 200 m off launch pad.|\n|April 15, 2016||1||Exploded immediately after launch.|\nOn April 28, 2016, North Korea again attempted to launch the Musudan, this time launching two missiles simultaneously. Both launches failed shortly after takeoff from Wonsan.6 On May 30, 2016 North Korea attempted its fourth and latest launch of the Musudan. It exploded on its launch pad.7\nOn June 21, 2016 North Korea attempted its fifth and sixth test of the Musudan. Japanese and South Korean officials stated that the first missile traveled approximately 150 km from its road mobile launcher located near the east coast city of Wonsan, and broke up mid-air.8 Later reports from North Korea claim that they intentionally destroyed the missile mid-flight.9 The second launch came approximately two hours later. During this test, the Musudan was able to travel 400 km, while reaching an altitude of over 1,000, according to the officials. The Department of Defense confirmed that STRATCOM detected and tracked both missile launches, and that each fell into the Sea of Japan.\nDespite the second test only reaching 400 km, North Korean run media regarded the launch to be a successful one, and quoted Kim Jong-un as saying “We have the sure capability to attack in an overall and practical way the Americans in the Pacific operation theater.”10 The Musudan IRBM does have an expected range of 2,500-4,000 km. This distance puts Guam, which hosts U.S. forces, within the missile’s range if it operates at its peak capability.\nThe launch, which may not be deemed a success by those outside North Korea, did nonetheless show improved performance for the Musudan. After five straight failures, the Musudan was able to display that its propulsion system, which raised it to over 1,000 km, is indeed working well. This is noteworthy because North Korea’s KN-08 ICBM and KN-14 ICBM are believed to use the same engine as the Musudan. However, both ICBM’s are three-staged and have yet to be tested.\nAdditionally, the odd trajectory of the missile, which achieved 1,000 km altitude but only 400 km in distance, likely means that the missile launcher was lofted significantly more upwards than what an operational launch would look like. 38 North, a website devoted to North Korea security analysis, points out that if the missile was positioned in a more traditional sense, it could have increased its distance enough to fly over foreign land, which would have likely caused a much more serious response to the launch.11\nNorth Korea conducted two test launches on October 15 and 20, 2016. Both tests are believed to have failed. 12']	['<urn:uuid:604095d6-785d-41ad-a61f-f3b3286cfda6>', '<urn:uuid:e3106a2e-3cc9-47a6-80f6-2481f37282e1>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	32	74	1421
35	physical learning environment modifications brain injury students classroom performance	Students with traumatic brain injury require specific physical learning environment modifications, as two-thirds experience difficulties with school work and half have attention/concentration problems. The brain craves novelty and is sensitive to environmental factors like lighting and background noise. To support these students, classroom adjustments should include regular changes in seating arrangements and wall displays, along with modifications to lighting and sound levels. However, research shows only 27% of brain-injured students receive special arrangements upon return to school, and one-third of teachers are unaware of the injury, highlighting the need for better environmental accommodations.

Teachers reported on academic performance and educational needs.\nMain measures: Classroom performance, Children’s Memory Scale (CMS), WISC-III, WORD.\nResults: One third of teachers were unaware of the TBI. On return to school, special arrangements were made for 18 children (27%). Special educational needs were identified for 16 (24%), but only six children (9%) received specialist help. Two-thirds of children with TBI had difficulties with school-work, half had attention/concentration problems and 26 (39%) had memory problems. Compared to other pupils in the class, one third of children with TBI were performing below average. On the CMS, one third of the severe group were impaired/borderline for immediate and delayed recall of verbal material, and over one quarter were impaired/borderline for general memory. Children in the severe group had a mean full-scale IQ significantly lower than controls. Half the TBI group had a reading age ≥1 year below their chronological age, one third were reading ≥2 years below chronological age.\nConclusions: Schools rely on parents to inform them about a TBI, and rarely receive information on possible long-term sequelae. At hospital discharge, health professionals\nshould provide schools with information about TBI and possible long-term impairments, so that children returning to school receive appropriate support.\n|Item Type:||Journal Article|\n|Subjects:||L Education > LC Special aspects of education\nB Philosophy.

Practioners of the model, Justin Holbrook, Jeremy Mettler, and Vicky Krug, describe the model as a set of guidelines to help organize material, “It gives you a way to organize the material you’re covering and to explore different ways to communicate it, explains Holbrook.\nKrug continues, “Learning only occurs when the student can connect new information to old information. Teaching someone how a car works is pointless if they don’t know what a car is.”\nMettler also points out the importance of recognizing it as a non-linear process, “The components are all interrelated.”\nBrain Target 1: Establish the emotional climate for learning\nNeuroscience: The brain feels before it thinks. The amygdala (think fight/flight) receives stimuli 40 milliseconds before the cortex (thinking). (LeDoux, 1996).\nUsable classroom translation: stress impedes learning. Try to connect with your students when they come into your class by making eye contact, greetings, and taking a moment to chat before diving into the lesson.\nBrain Target 2: Creating the Physical Learning Environment\nNeuroscience: The brain craves novelty. Posner & Rothbart, 2007); lighting, background noise impact on attention; the body is designed for movement (Medina, 2008)\nUsable classroom translation: make regular changes in your classroom such as seating arrangements, wall displays. Inventory your learning space and note where it’s possible to modify things such as lighting, turning down speakers, etc.\nBrain Target 3: Designing the Learning Experience\nNeuroscience behind it: The brain looks for patterns between known and unknown information (Posner & Rothbart, 2007)\nUsable classroom translation: Give students the big picture; visually represent the connections between previous knowledge and new learning; indicate relationships among learning goals.\nBrain Target 4: Teaching for Mastery\nNeuroscience behind it: In order for information to be retained it must make its way from short-term to long-term memory.\nUsable classroom translation: Use the arts as a tool to enhance and reinforce learning goals (Rinne, Gregory, Yarmolinskaya, and Hardiman, 2011)\nBrain Target 5: Teaching for the Extension\nNeuroscience behind it: The brain is plastic. Significant changes occur in the brain due to repeated sensory experience (Fu & Zuo,2011, Karmarkar & Dan, 2006)\nUsable classroom translation: Creativity can be taught but it builds on a body of content knowledge being mastered. Interweave information and thinking in all content areas; show real world applications, move away from simple, single-answer problems to encourage divergent solutions.\nBrain Target 6: Evaluating Learning\nNeuroscience behind it: Assessments provides feedback that informs and motivates students; retrieval of information recruits memory systems, reinforcing memory for that information.\nUsable classroom translation: Feedback has to be useful, timely; model active retrieval – flashcards, self-quizzing (no looking at the answers), space learning, multiple types of assessments.\nFurther Reading & Connecting\nFor more information about brain targeted teaching go to braintargetedteaching.org\nCheck out a trailer for the documentary Grey Matters, exploring Hardiman’s model in practice, with Holbrook, Mettler, and Krug here.\nThis film is currently crowdfunding for postproduction funds (all donations are tax deductible).\nRamona Persaud is an independent documentary filmmaker, writer, and photographer. “Grey Matters” is her second film. Persaud’s first film, “It’s a Different World,” explores the world of autism through the eyes of three autistic children.

36	What options do the keyboard instruments have for changing sounds?	The keyboard instruments feature key-switches that trigger variations such as drawbar registrations and Clav pickup settings. While they don't offer deep synth-level editing, they come with excellent effects that can create significant tonal variation from a single instrument sound.	['The keyboard section has several clean and dirty variants\nof Rhodes and Fender Piano Bass, Wurly, Clavinet, Hammond, and combo\norgans including Farfisa Compact, Vox Continental, and even an air-blown\nEmenee toy organ. Across the board, the samples are full of character.\nThe Rhodes has plenty of both sparkle and bark, and its harmonic profile\nleans slightly Wurly as some real Rhodes pianos did. While the Hammonds\ndon’t have drawbars, they’re grindy, full, and warm. However, on\npatches that have harmonic percussion, it triggers polyphonically, i.e. not vintage-correctly.\nKey-switches trigger variations such as drawbar\nregistrations, Clav pickup settings, and the like. Other than that, the\nuser interface generally doesn’t get you inside the keyboard sounds at\nthe “synth editing” level (not counting the deeper editing you can do in\nthe full version of Kontakt, of course). Instead, it focuses on the\neffects (keep reading), which are excellent and can get a lot of tonal\nvariation out of one instrument sound.\nGuitars and Basses\nThe expected Strats, Teles, Les Pauls, and Rickenbackers\nall deliver authentic tone, key-switched variations, and tons of\nexpression. “Guild Acoustic Clean” was a standout that made me want to\nplay the guitar part from Jethro Tull’s “Thick as a Brick.” Often,\ndifferent velocities will vary the amount of sustain, so be sure to\nMy favorite bass was “1950s Gibson EB2 Clean,” which put a\ndense, browned-butter foundation under anything it touched—I’m reaching\nfor it on all kinds of tracks now. A couple of surf guitar options are\ndutifully Dick Dale, and if there’s a better sound to open a cover of\nStevie Wonder’s “Signed, Sealed, Delivered” than Vintage VI’s electric\nsitar, I haven’t heard it.\nAll guitar and bass sounds feature a legato/portamento\nmode that aids realistic note slides, and has presets optimized for\nplaying different intervals. The trade-off is that this makes the\ninstrument monophonic, so you’d use it mainly for lead and bass parts. A\n“release retrigger” option combines last-note priority with\nretriggering of the first held note when you let go of other notes. With\na little practice, this facilitates guitar techniques such as\nDrums and Percussion\nThe drums just may be most flexible and powerful aspect of\nVintage VI; Big Fish would probably have had no trouble marketing it\nby itself as a retro drum instrument. The names any drum aficionado\nwould search out are all here: Rogers, Ludwig, Slingerland, Gretsch, and\nthe like. Sampling is hi-fi and, to my ears, loop-free.\nWhere the keyboards were sparse on user editing, the drums\nare just the opposite. Clicking on a drum or cymbal in the graphical\nkit brings up a pane of parameters where you can swap out pieces, tune\nthem individually, and adjust several velocity response settings for\neach. Also adjustable for each piece are the\n“humanize” settings, which use round-robin sampling and velocity\nresponse to vary pitch and volume, avoiding the telltale “drums on a\nThe drums’ mixer pane is surprisingly sophisticated for\nthis type of all-in-one product. In it, you can blend close, overhead,\nand room mic positions—and access insert effects (such as EQ, dynamics,\nand saturation) per drum. Then, send-based effects include reverb,\nchorus, flanger, and delay. You can also customize the keyboard mapping\nof drum hits. Seriously—both the audio quality and programmability of\nthe drums made me do a double take.\nInstruments in the Percussion folder comprise four presets\nthat cover the Latin and orchestra/band percussion. One is an extended\nrack of Roto-Toms, so you’re covered if your definition of vintage\nextends to the ’80s.\nAll instrument types except the drum kits (which have the\neffects in the mixer) put 12 effects front and center in the main\nwindow. Though the stompbox-like chain varies based on the patch,\nstaples include a transient shaper, rotary speaker, stereo widener,\ndistortion, cabinet modeler, four-band parametric EQ, bus compressor,\nand tape simulator. Next are sends: delay, chorus, flanger, phaser, and\nreverb. If you drag another VV instrument into the same Kontakt rack,\nits send effects are independent and can have different settings.\nClicking any effect’s Edit button opens a pane of\nparameter knobs—the speed for the rotary effect (surprisingly good given\nthat this isn’t a dedicated B-3 plug-in) is in here, so assign a\nphysical control to it if you want it at hand’s reach. The effects sound\ngreat, and the way they’re presented makes it inviting to just click\naway until you get a sound you like.\nHome studio denizens tend to go for specialization in our\nvirtual instrument racks. That can make it tempting to dismiss an\nall-in-one approach as less than serious, but I suspect that serious\ncomposers who work under deadlines will think differently about Vintage\nVI. You could easily spend far more time choosing the right sample,\nlayering the right audio plug-ins on it, tweaking their settings, and by\nthe time the track sits in the mix how you want, wind up with a sound\nvery close to what VV would’ve produced in just a few clicks.\nThis becomes pertinent when your deadlines are for a\nnon-musician client who described their vision in non-musician terms. If\nthose terms are meant to evoke a time when neither cigarettes nor\nunprotected intimacy were considered bad for you, Vintage VI is the\nquickest route from blank DAW arrange window to “Where’s my check?” that\nwe’ve yet seen.']	['<urn:uuid:ccef6da5-2527-485b-9da1-e5225f4a1d4c>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	10	39	886
37	How do newspaper and map collections differ in accessibility?	The National Library's digitized newspaper collection through Trove offers online access to over 20 million pages from 1000+ titles, with full text searchability. In contrast, maps at the Central Library are split into two physical collections: a lending collection of travel maps and a reference-only collection of New Zealand and Pacific topographical maps and nautical charts, both found on the Second floor.	"['Newspapers are a unique and valued source of information for historical research. The National and state libraries in Australia have always recognised their importance and have worked together to collect, preserve and provide access to newspapers through the Australian Newspaper Plan. One of the most effective strategies to both preserve and make newspaper content more accessible is to digitise and maintain them for online access.\nThe National Library started the Australian Newspaper Digitisation Program in 2007. To date, more than 20 million pages of digitised newspapers can be accessed online through Trove, the National Library’s online search service.These newspapers cover all states and territories and from the earliest published newspaper in 1803 to the mid 20th century. There are also a few newspapers in languages other than English. The digitised content is securely stored and will be managed into the future by the National Library. Libraries, historical societies, universities, businesses, local councils and other organisations are invited to contribute to this program, and assist with achieving the goal to provide permanent access to a wide range of newspaper titles.\nThrough these Guidelines the Library aims to:\nprovide information on how libraries and other organisations can contribute digitised newspaper content to Trove;\nassist libraries and other institutions to plan their projects and prepare budget bids for digitisation of newspaper titles.\nHaving newspapers digitised and accessed via Trove is the best way to ensure they reach a national audience. The coverage and quality of newspaper content and the innovative delivery and infrastructure supporting permanent access has already made Trove an indispensable national resource for historical research.\nWith more than 200 million articles from over 1000 newspaper titles from every Australian state and territory already delivered online, Trove provides online access to an unprecedented quantity and range of Australia’s newspaper heritage.\nOn Trove, users can also easily find related information in a range of other formats such as books, pictures, maps and sound recordings while researching newspapers.\nAll of the digitised newspapers are fully text-searchable and ways to refine results are supported. Content can be searched in the context of other Australian newspaper titles.\nTrove offers the facilities to enable users to enrich and enhance the data through subject tagging, text correction and annotations.\nNewspapers are digitised in a standard format which supports long-term preservation and ongoing access.\nThe digitisation process and how to contribute\nFrom our experience the most efficient approach to digitise a newspaper for online access is to scan the master copy of its microfilm, then perform content analysis and apply Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to the scanned content. It is a complex undertaking requiring specialised knowledge, skills and systems support. It involves consistent application of specifications, quality assurance of the digital images and text generated by Optical Character Recognition (OCR) processing, as well as providing storage and management of large volumes of data for ongoing access.\nFor these reasons, the National Library prefers to undertake the scanning and OCR processing on behalf of the contributing organisation, with funds transferred to the Library to cover the costs of the work. This approach has the following advantages:\n- the contributors can make use of the established information technology infrastructure and specialist knowledge of the technical requirements developed at the Library;\n- efficient workflows are utilised, ensuring that specifications and standards that underpin Trove are met and human intervention is minimized;\n- double handling and unnecessary overhead costs are minimized;\n- the contributors can benefit from volume discounts, established processes and relationships which the National Library has with scanning and OCR contractors.\nThe role of the contributing organisation is therefore to initiate the digitisation process by:\n- nominating a title and years for digitisation. Most titles included in Trove to date are from the years up until 1954 but post-1954 content can be included where permission to do so has been negotiated with the copyright owner by the contributing organization;\n- checking the availability of microfilm for the title it would like to digitise with the relevant state or territory library and seeking permission to use it;\n- contacting the National Library as soon as practicable, as it is important to ensure the approach taken is compatible with the technical requirements of Trove;\n- Discussing with the National Library any specific requirements and timelines for the digitisation process. For instance the Library may be able to complete the digitisation to a set timeline or manage the project in stages. The priority assigned to contributed content will depend upon the annual workload and capacity of the Australian Newspapers Digitisation Program (ANDP) team, the size and complexity of the project.\nThe National Library welcomes opportunities to support funding applications by contributing organisations.\nBased on the preferred approach in which organisations provide funding to the Library to manage the digitisation process and delivery of content in Trove, the charge applied by the Library is $2.31 per page (including GST).\nThis indicative cost is based on scanning an English language newspaper from microfilm, and covers the direct costs of the digitisation process – scanning, OCR processing, content analysis and quality assurance, the full cost of staff time spent on project management and all systems infrastructure required to ingest, store and manage the digitised newspapers for long-term access. A breakdown of the costs in these categories is listed further below.\nAdditional charges may apply if:\n- scanning from hard copy newspapers is required;\n- the language content of the newspapers is not English; or\n- the contributing organisation requires its own copy of the digitised content.\nRoles and responsibilities\nThe National Library will undertake digitisation on behalf of organisations for a charge as outlined above on the understanding that:\n- unrestricted access can be provided to the content through Trove; for post-1954 content, the organisation contributing it must negotiate and document reproduction permission with copyright owners;\n- the contributor will establish a standard Wikipedia page (http://en.wikipedia.org/) providing information on the title being processed;\n- if they are a Libraries Australia member, the contributor will catalogue the title to be digitised on Libraries Australia;\n- once ingested into Trove, no content will be removed or suppressed except for legal reasons;\n- the National Library will acknowledge the funding source of contributed content on Trove;\n- the National Library has the right to manage the content for long-term access in whatever way it considers appropriate;\n- if the contributor requires a copy of the master file of contributed content, this can only be provided at the time the content is processed into Trove.\nMemorandum of Understanding\nBefore the National Library can carry out a digitisation project on behalf of another organisation, it is required that a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is signed by both parties. The MOU will cover the roles and responsibilities outlined above that will apply to each party.\nFor further information and to discuss opportunities for inclusion of content in Trove, please contact:\nThe Contributor Liaison Officer\nAustralian Newspaper Plan\nNational Library of Australia\n(02) 6262 1005\nBreakdown of the costs incurred by the National Library in managing a digitisation project on behalf of another library.\n(i) Project management\nProject set-up tasks\n- Provide a cost estimate for the project to the funding organisation.\n- Ensure the funding organisation understands the roles and responsibilities as outlined above.\n- Confirm the availability of the source material.\n- Ensure an ISSN has been allocated to the title.\n- Schedule the title for scanning and OCR processing and establish orders with the scanning and OCR contractors which set out all of the requirements and timelines for the title being processed.\n- Establish budget processes.\nProject oversight tasks\n- Arrange inventory for source microfilm and its secure transport to scanning contractor and its return to owner.\n- Arrange transport of digital images to the National Library, writing of data tapes and courier of tapes to OCR contractor and ftp transfer of OCR deliverables to the National Library.\n- Undertake a pilot process with the OCR contractor to ensure correct application of specifications to the particular newspaper title.\n- Establish a weekly delivery schedule and monthly reporting schedule with contractors.\n- Monitor workflow and adherence to timelines and schedules with contractors.\n- Monitor workflows associated with data ingest.\n- Undertake trouble-shooting and clarification of requirements and specifications with contractors as required.\n- Communicate with the funding organisation.\n- Arrange for acknowledgement of support on Trove for the funding organisation on completion of the project\n(ii) Digitisation (scanning, OCR processing, content analysis, and quality assessment)\n- Per page cost of scanning, OCR processing and content analysis using the National Library’s service providers.\n- Per page cost of quality assurance carried out by National Library staff.\n- Cost of data tapes for transfer of digital images.\n- Courier and packaging costs for transfer of microfilm and data tapes.\n- Provision of systems infrastructure required to ingest and manage the contributed data.\n- Provision of systems infrastructure required to store and preserve the contributed data for long-term access.\n- IT support for the whole cycle of digital files constituting the content of digitsed newspapers on Trove.', ""Central Library Collections\nAdult learning / English as a second languageOn the Ground floor, by the escalator, there is a small collection of books and CDs to improve your reading and English or Te reo Māori skills. The collection is divided into three levels: yellow for beginners, blue for intermediate and purple for advanced.

38	georgia jury size court difference	In Superior and State courts, juries consist of 12 jurors, while in Municipal Courts, jury trials are conducted with 6 jurors.	['Each county in the state of Georgia has several different courts. Each court has “jurisdiction” over certain types of cases. All counties in Georgia have a Superior Court, a Probate Court, a Magistrate Court, and a Juvenile Court. Most larger counties also have a State Court. In some cities there is also a Municipal Court, which handles certain types of civil and criminal cases and other duties. Some cities also have courts that can only handle certain types of cases, usually criminal bond hearings, traffic tickets, or city ordinance violation cases.\nThe Superior Courts of Georgia have jurisdiction over almost all types of cases, except matters that must be filed in Probate Court or Juvenile Court. Cases that can be filed in Superior Court include general civil cases and criminal cases. Cases that must be filed in Superior Court include divorces, adoptions, legitimation and paternity cases, child custody cases, family violence and stalking petitions, real estate or land cases, civil injunction cases, and other specific types of cases. The Superior Court has “exclusive” jurisdiction over these cases, meaning that such cases can only be filed in Superior Court.\nSuperior courts are governed by the Uniform Superior Court Rules, which have a lot of detailed and confusing rules, especially concerning certain types of case such as Divorce, Legitimation, Paternity, and Child Custody cases.\nJudges of the Superior Courts are elected in a Judicial Circuit, which is a group of one or more Georgia counties. More often than not, Superior Court Judges are appointed by the Governor to fill an “unexpired term,” and the appointed Judge then stands for election when the term is up. The number of Superior Court Judges in a Judicial Circuit depends on the population and may be two to twenty. A Judge can live in any county in the Circuit, but in Circuits that consist of a very large county surrounded by smaller counties, most of the elected Judges may live in the large county and travel to hold court in the surrounding counties. The qualifications to become a Superior Court Judge are minimal, and can be found here. There is no legal requirement of competency, nor even a requirement that a candidate has handled a trial.\nAll Superior Courts can conduct Jury Trials. Appeals from Superior Court go to either the Georgia Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court of Georgia.\nThese courts handle the probate of wills and administration of estates of deceased persons, plus petitions in which a conservatorship of a minor or an incompetent person is sought, and have “exclusive jurisdiction” over these matters. Probate courts also issue marriage licenses and gun permits. In some counties, the Probate Court may have additional responsibilities, such as reviewing Family Violence or Stalking Petitions initially or hearing traffic tickets. The jurisdiction of Probate Court also varies according to the size of the county.\nA Probate Court in a large county, known as an Article 6 Probate Court, can hear certain types of cases that can also be heard by the Superior Court and can also conduct a Jury Trial.\nProbate courts are subject to the Uniform Probate Court Rules, which include a number of user-friendly forms for most petitions filed in Probate Court.\nProbate Court Judges are elected. Article 6 Probate Court Judges must be licensed attorneys, but other Probate Court Judges are not required to be attorneys. The qualifications to become a Probate Court Judge can be found here. There is no legal requirement of knowledge or competency in the types of matters handled in Probate Court.\nAppeals from Probate Courts generally go to the Superior Court of the County, but some appeals go to a higher court.\nState Courts, which do not exist in every Georgia county, are authorized to handle civil cases in which money damages are sought, without any limit on the amount of damages, and misdemeanor criminal cases. In a county where there is a State Court, that court will likely handle misdemeanor criminal cases such as DUI, simple battery, or traffic ticket cases and the Superior Court will handle felony criminal cases. In counties where there is no State Court, these cases will be handled by the Superior Court since it also has jurisdiction over such cases.\nState courts follow the Uniform State Court Rules, basically the same rules as Superior courts minus rules that apply to Domestic cases, which cannot be filed in a State Court.\nState Court Judges are elected. They may be appointed by the Governor to fill and “unexpired term” of a retiring Judge, and then run for election at the end of that term. They must be licensed attorneys, and all qualifications to become a State Court Judge can be read here. There is no legal requirement that a State Court Judge have competency in trials or legal matters handled in State Court.\nState Courts can conduct Jury Trials. Appeals from a State Court go to the Georgia Court of Appeals or Supreme Court.\nThese courts have jurisdiction only over cases arising in a city, and may handle a variety of cases, including possessory writs, peace bonds, bad check charges, some types of misdemeanor criminal cases, preliminary hearings, and money damage civil cases limited to some amount,typically $15,000. Generally a civil damages case that can be filed in a Municipal court can also be filed in a Superior or State Court.\nMunicipal courts have a separate set of rules called the Uniform Municipal Court Rules that govern how the court is conducted. These rules are less complicated than the Superior or State Court rules.\nMunicipal Court Judges are elected. They may be appointed to fill an “unexpired term” of a retiring Judge, and then run for election at the end of that term. They must be licensed attorneys, but the few additional qualifications to become a Municipal Court Judge can be read here. There is no legal requirement that a Municipal Court Judge have competency in trials or legal matters handled in the Court.\nMunicipal Courts can conduct Jury Trials, although the number of jurors is 6, rather than 12 as applies in other Jury Trial Courts. Appeals from a Municipal Court go to different courts depending the type of case.\nEvery county has this court, which has simplified rules that make it easier for individuals to handle their cases without a lawyer. Cases are heard quickly because the Magistrate Court rules don’t allow “discovery.” There is a limitation on the amount of money damages that can be sought. A Magistrate Judge is not required to have a law degree.\nA Magistrate Court cannot conduct a Jury Trial. Appeals from a Magistrate Court go to the Superior Court in the County for a brand new trial de novo.\nMagistrate Court Judges are elected, and are not required to be attorneys. They need only have a high school education. The qualifications to become a Magistrate Court Judge are here.\nThis is a specialized court that addresses matters concerning minor children, such as certain types of child custody matters, criminal charges against minors (with exceptions), petitions to terminate parental rights, and petitions brought by parents against their “unruly” children. There is no right to a jury trial.\nNot all counties have a separate Juvenile Court. In small counties, a Superior Court Judge may conduct Juvenile Court proceedings.\nThe Uniform Juvenile Court Rules apply to Juvenile Court. More rules governing Juvenile courts are found in the statutes that authorize Juvenile Court and the procedures and cases that can be handled by a Juvenile Court.\nJuvenile Court Judges are appointed by the Judges of the Superior Court Circuit in which the Juvenile Court is located. They must be licensed attorneys. Their qualifications can be read here.\nA Juvenile Court cannot conduct a Jury Trial. Appeals from Juvenile Court go to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court depending on the type of case or matter.\nSelection of a Court\nThe duties of these courts may vary from county to county, so always check in your county to determine what type of cases go where. If a case is brought against you, the paperwork will state the court in which the case has been filed. If you are filing a case, the court in which it can be filed will be dictated by the type of case. If the case is for damages, the amount of damages sought will dictate whether the case can be brought in a Municipal or the Magistrate Court, since these courts have a limit on money damages.\nJury Trials in Georgia\nIn courts that can conduct jury trials, parties have a right to a jury trial in most but not all types of cases. Child Custody matters, whether arising in a Divorce, Legitimation, or Paternity case or some other Child Custody case, can only be decided by a Judge. Because of this, it is quite possible that there may be 2 separate trials in such cases, one by a Judge to determine Child Custody and a second trial in front of a Jury to determine the remaining issues. In some types of cases, the issues that may be presented to a Jury are limited. In Superior and State courts, juries consist of 12 jurors.\nCivil Practice in Georgia\nLike all states and the federal government, Georgia has a “Civil Practice Act” that governs all aspects of all civil cases in courts that are subject to the Act, regardless of the type of case. These rules are detailed. The rules allow certain procedures that lawyers understand and utilize, such as “Discovery,” which allows parties to seek, formally, information from the opposing party(yes), conduct Depositions, and obtain documents and other items, even from people, businesses, banks, or others who are not parties in the case, and “Summary Judgment,” which allows lawyers to ask a Judge to throw out a case for legal reasons or because the facts don’t support the case. Cases filed in Superior, State, and municipal courts are subject to these rules.\nCases filed in a Superior, State, or Municipal Court must be filed and handled following the provisions of the Georgia Civil Practice Act, plus the specific Uniform Rules that govern each of these courts.\nAs mentioned above, Magistrate Court was designed to be “user friendly,” and though it too has rules, these rules are simpler and much less complicated. The Georgia Civil Practice Act does not apply.\nFederal Court System in Georgia\nIn addition to Georgia Courts, the United States has a number of Federal District Courts in Georgia. Some types of cases, such as certain damages cases, can be filed in these courts if certain circumstances are applicable. Some types of cases must be filed in a Federal District Court and some cases filed in a Georgia state court can be “removed” or transferred to a Federal District Court.\nThe Federal Court system is extremely complicated, with its own Civil Practice Act plus detailed rules that mandate how cases are filed and handled.']	['<urn:uuid:1c2b94f9-53c7-430a-b398-a71822cc76ce>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	5	21	1832
39	tashlich activities for kids at home	You can do tashlich activities with kids at home by using bath crayons to write things to be sorry about and wash them away, writing with pavement chalk and erasing with water balloons, or floating papers with washable marker writings in a paddling pool.	"['Tashlich, which literally translates to “casting off,” is a ceremony performed on the afternoon of the first day of Rosh Hashanah. During this ceremony, Jews symbolically cast off the sins of the previous year by tossing pebbles or bread crumbs into flowing water. During this ritual, people think of things they’ve done wrong in the past year and then “throw them away,” promising for improvement in the coming year.\nKids can easily grasp the ideas of wanting to do better and saying ""sorry,"" so including them in a simple, age-appropriate tashlich ceremony is a great way to build understanding about the ritual while building a fun family tradition.\nMany of the ideas in the list below are great for children ages four and up. If your children are too young to remember mistakes or make a list of them, you can help write a simple list, and let them focus on the fun of the ""washing away"" part of the activity.\nUse Bath Crayons\nUse bath crayons to write or draw things you are sorry about in the tub and then wash them away. Again, if your kids are too young to verbalise or recognise things that they are sorry for, you can do the writing or drawing for them and then let them do the part -- washing away the writing.\nGrab the Pavement Chalk\nMake a short list together and write it out in pavement chalk. Then, fill up some water balloons, or use the hose, to ""erase"" the words and sentences in the list. You\'ll be left with beautiful, and temporary, rainbow streaks on your driveway or pavement.\nFill Up the Paddling Pool\nDon’t have running water near your home? Instead use whatever you have around, like a paddling pool or even a bowl or tub of water. While having a discussion about tashlich’s values, have your children write/draw some of their transgressions on pieces of white copy paper in washable marker. Float the papers in the water and have them watch as their sins and mistakes disappear.\nRead a Story\nThe following picture books offer easy to understand explanations of tashlich along with some extra ideas for family or community ceremonies.\nRecommended for children 3 to 5 years old\nBeni loves getting together with family on Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year -- if only it weren’t for his mischievous cousin, Max. Max is making trouble for everyone! But Grandpa has a few words of wisdom about starting off the New Year right.\nRecommended for children 5 to 7 years old\nIn this contemporary story, Izzy finds it difficult to apologise for a certain mistake, until the Rosh Hashanah tashlich service gives him new understanding.\nRecommended for children 7 to 8 years old\nOn Rosh Hashanah, many families participate in tashlich, a tradition of throwing bread crumbs into water to wash away the mistakes of the past year. But this family has their own spin on tashlich -- and it takes place at Turtle Rock.\nAugust 27, 2018']"	['<urn:uuid:db4fc75c-804d-4a5b-831b-6576de0c030e>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	6	44	502
40	Does Medicare Part D cover supplements?	Part D prescription drug coverage does not usually include supplements and over-the-counter medications. You will be required to cover the full cost of these items.	"[""What Drugs Are Covered By Part D Plans?\nMedications are prescribed for all types of medical conditions these days. Many Medicare recipients depend on prescription medications to reduce or eliminate the symptoms of various conditions. Unfortunately, prescription medications can be costly without insurance. Medicare recipients can save money on prescription drugs by enrolling in Part D. Prescription drug coverage does have limitations, however, so it’s important to understand what is and is not included in Medicare Part D.\nMedicare Benefits Solutions\nSep 8, 2020\nMedications covered by Part D plans\nMedicare Part D covers a wide variety of prescription drugs, but there are some limitations and exceptions. In order to know whether a drug is covered by your plan, you will need to check your plan’s formulary. A formulary lists all drugs that are included in a particular plan’s coverage. Even though there are standards set by the federal Medicare program, your plan may include or exclude specific medications. You’ll want to discuss your options with your physician, if possible before having a prescription written. An alternative medication may be available that addresses your condition and works within your plan’s formulary.\nWhat drugs are not covered?\nIf you find that no suitable alternative exists and the drug you are prescribed is not included in your plan’s formulary, you can file for an exemption with Medicare. This is usually done through your physician’s office, but you can also contact your plan manager or local Medicare office to learn more. You will need to provide a valid reason for needing an exemption, and if approved, you may still have limitations on coverage of your exempted medications.\nDoes Medicare Part D cover medications administered in a doctor’s office?Although most prescription medications are purchased from a pharmacy and self-administered at home, there are scenarios in which you may be given a medication outside of the home. A doctor may administer medication in his or her office to monitor its effectiveness or a medication could be used during an inpatient hospital stay. In these cases, Medicare Part D would usually not cover the cost of the medications. Instead, Medicare Parts A and/or B would apply. Medicare Part A provides coverage for care while in a hospital or skilled nursing facility, and Medicare Part B covers the cost of outpatient care administered in a doctor’s office or at a clinic.\nAre supplements covered?\nPart D prescription drug coverage does not usually include supplements and over-the-counter medications. This means that you will be required to cover the full cost of these items, and you will also be ineligible to file a claim for purchases.\nIf, however, you have a Medicare Advantage plan, you may be entitled to additional benefits that are not included in Original Medicare. These benefits may help you pay for supplements or provide reimbursement for purchases of some over-the-counter medications. To be sure that any medication you take is covered, you will need to refer to your plan’s formulary or speak with your Medicare plan manager\nComparing drug plans\nPrescription drug coverage was not originally included in the Medicare program when it was introduced in 1965, but as of 2006, coverage for self-administered drugs is available to Medicare recipients under Part D coverage. This optional coverage provides a benefit for individuals who frequently need medications or who have chronic conditions that require routine treatment through the use of prescription drugs. Review and compare the drug plans available in your area to find the one that meets your individual needs.\nFind a new Medicare plan\nGet a plan recommendation based on what's important to you.""]"	['<urn:uuid:320f445f-76ab-46f0-a517-338fae0307dd>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	6	25	600
41	What material is horn combs made of?	Horn combs are made of keratin, which is the same substance that human hair consists of.	"[""Horn contains keratin – the same substance our hair consists of. As it absorbs moisture and oil, it creates a special caring effect when you comb your hair with a comb made of horn. Synthetic combs typically show sharp edges, which are caused during production, whereas handmade horn combs have very smoothly rounded teeth and thus do not irritate the scalp or damage your hair. Moreover, it prevents dandruff. Another advantage of using horn combs is that the hair is not charged electrostatically as it is often the case with combs made of thermoplastic synthetic material.\nEvery horn product has a unique colour and pattern by nature. Being processed manually, horn products are unique in their elegance and haptics. Small irregularities are not considered a defect but as a typical characteristic of the handmade production.\nHorn is harder, denser and more wear-resistant than most wood types. However, as with wood, horn can be processed through sawing, polishing, turning or carving. Unlike wood, horn is less resistant to tension and bending, but it is extremely resistant to pressure. Due to these characteristics, horn has been used to improve the elasticity of hunter's and rider's bows, with horn sheets being laminated to the pressure face of the bows, since the Stone Age. Also in the Middle Ages, crossbows were reinforced with horn for the same purpose.\nOrigin and Quality\nHorn material is gained from almost all horned animals, for example cows, Watusi, sheep, goats, zebu, water buffalo, yaks etc. Horn is a by-product of slaughter, which means that the animals are not killed for obtaining the horn.\nOf course, the horn we deal with, is not from endangered species. Most of our horn products are made of horn from domesticated or semi-barbarian species of the Indian or African buffalo.\nThe horn colour varies, depending on its origin, from black, brown mottled, yellow up and to nearly transparent, as such can be found with albino animals. The quality of the material does not depend on its colour, but on the living conditions of the animals. Wildlife animals or animals living in rough conditions, for example, usually have harder and more finely-structured horns. Another important factor for the quality of horn material is the way it is stored and processed. Most horns on the market are from regions with high humidity. When storing these horns, it is important to make sure that the material does not dry too fast, because this may cause fissures and brittleness as is also typical of tropical timbers. When it comes to processing horn, for example while cutting or welding, strong local heating of the material should be avoided.\nThe colour-intensive, typically patterned horn of the Madagascar Zebu has made Madagascar a centre of horn production and processing. As the animals are kept in their natural environment and in free range and due to the traditional knowledge and form awareness of the local horn producers, the horn products have a very good quality, characterized by its high breaking resistance and fine structure.\nIt is important to distinguish horn from antler or tooth material, although these are also often called “horn”. Deer, reindeer, or moose antlers and wild boar teeth do not consist of keratin, but mainly of calcium phosphate, i. e. bone substance. Therefore, this material is much harder than horn and thus different processing techniques have to be applied.""]"	['<urn:uuid:5a09ea1c-24a5-4970-a38b-d96f2e483e16>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	7	16	561
42	How do demineralization and GERD symptoms affect tooth health?	Demineralization is a chemical process that removes minerals (mainly calcium) from dental hard tissues through dissolution by acids or chelation. GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease) contributes to this process as it causes stomach acid to reflux into the mouth, where the hydrochloric acid contacts and erodes enamel surfaces. This erosion leads to localized loss of dental hard tissue, causing teeth to lose their surface texture, appear more yellow, and have an altered shape.	"['buffering capacity – Saliva and the fluid in dental plaque possess the ability to buffer. Buffering adjusts the pH of any solution such as saliva or plaque fluid, and can resist changes in pH. Buffering capacity is the degree of buffering that can be brought about.\nchelation – As it applies to the oral cavity, chelation is the process whereby citric acid has the ability to demineralize enamel to a much greater degree than its pH can explain. Through its chelating properties, citric acid removes calcium from the enamel surface, and through chelation forms a compound from which the calcium cannot be released. Therefore, the calcium is not available to diffuse back into the tooth. Citric acid also has the ability to chelate calcium in saliva, reducing the remineralizing effect.\ndemineralization – The chemical process by which minerals (mainly calcium) are removed from the dental hard tissues – enamel, dentin, and cementum. The chemical process occurs through dissolution by acids or by chelation, and the rate of demineralization will vary due to the degree of supersaturation of the immediate environment of the tooth and the presence of fluoride. In optimal circumstances, the minerals may be replaced through the process of remineralization.\ndentin hypersensitivity – Tooth pain that is characterized by brief, sharp, well-localized pain in response to thermal, evaporative, tactile, osmotic, or chemical stimuli that cannot be ascribed to any other dental disease or condition. Exposed dentin is a feature, and therefore the condition is associated with enamel wear (usually erosion) or gingival recession.\ndeveloped countries – A term not frequently used today in classifying countries, as no definitive definition exists. The term is used to describe countries with industrialized economies and higher levels of gross domestic product. Developed countries are able to spend more on health systems. These systems are typically treatment-oriented and focus services on the needs of the individual rather than the community.\nerosion – Localized loss of dental hard tissue that is chemically etched away from the tooth surface by acids or chelating agents. Can be referred to as Acid Erosion or Acid Wear. Teeth exhibiting signs of erosion lose their surface texture (perichymata), may appear more yellow, and have an altered shape.\nfluorapatite – A crystal structure in tooth mineral (Ca10 (PO4)6 F2) resulting from the replacement of hydroxyl ions (OH-) in the hydroxyapatite structure with fluoride ions (F-). Fluorapatite (also commonly referred to as fluoroapatite, fluorhydroxyapatite or fluorohydroxyapatite) is stronger and more acid resistant than hydroxyapatite.\nGERD – Gastroesophageal reflux disease; the reflux of hydrochloric acid generated in the stomach that travels to the mouth. Erosion will occur upon the acid’s contact with enamel surfaces.\nhydroxyapatite – Crystals of calcium phosphate – (Ca10 (PO4)6 OH2) that form the mineral structure of teeth and bone. Enamel comprises approximately 98% hydroxyapatite (by weight). Much of the hydroxyapatite in enamel, however, is a calcium-deficient carbonated hydroxyapatite, the crystals of which are readily dissolved by acids. The addition of fluoride creates fluorapatite, which is less soluble and more acid-resistant.\nions - Atoms or molecules that carry either a positive or a negative electric charge in a solution. For example, sodium chloride (NaCl, common table salt) in water dissociates into Na+ and Cl– ions.\nprevalent – Widespread; widely or commonly occurring.\nremineralization – The chemical process by which minerals (mainly calcium) are replaced into the substance of the dental hard tissues – enamel, dentin and cementum. The process requires an ideal environment that includes supersaturation with calcium and phosphate ions, and adequate buffering. In the presence of fluoride, remineralization is enhanced.\ntooth wear – The non-carious loss of tooth tissue through the processes of attrition, abfraction, abrasion, or erosion, occurring alone or combined (most typically abrasion and erosion).\nxerostomia – A subjective assessment of mouth dryness, usually but not always associated with low levels of saliva production. Inadequate production of saliva occurs for many reasons, most commonly as an unwanted effect of many prescription and over-the-counter medicines. Saliva is necessary for maintaining a healthy mouth, and, in relation to dental caries, is essential for remineralization.', ""What is GERD?\nGastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, occurs when acid from the stomach backs up into the esophagus. Normally, food travels from the mouth, down through the esophagus and into the stomach. A ring of muscle at the bottom of the esophagus, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), contracts to keep the acidic contents of the stomach from “refluxing” or coming back up into the esophagus. In those who have GERD, the LES does not close properly, allowing acid to move up the esophagus.\nWhen stomach acid touches the sensitive tissue lining the esophagus, it causes a reaction similar to squirting lemon juice in your eye. This is why GERD is often characterized by the burning sensation known as heartburn.\nOccasional heartburn is normal. However, if heartburn becomes chronic, occurring more than twice a week, you may have GERD. Left untreated, GERD can lead to more serious health problems.\nWho gets GERD?\nAnyone can have GERD. Women, men, infants and children can all experience this disorder. Overweight people and pregnant women are particularly susceptible because of the pressure on their stomachs. Recent studies indicate that GERD may often be overlooked in infants and children. In infants and children, GERD can cause repeated vomiting, coughing, and other respiratory problems such as sore throat and ear infections. Most infants grow out of GERD by the time they are one year old.\nTips to Prevent GERD\n● Do not drink alcohol● Lose weight● Quit smoking● Limit problem foods such as:● Caffeine● Carbonated drinks● Chocolate● Peppermint● Tomato and citrus foods● Fatty and fried foods● Wear loose clothing● Eat small meals and slowly\nWhat are the symptoms of GERD?\nThe symptoms of GERD may include persistent heartburn, acid regurgitation, and nausea. Some people have GERD without heartburn. Instead, they experience pain in the chest that can be sever enough to mimic the pain of a heart attack, hoarseness in the morning, or trouble swallowing. Some people may also feel like they have food stuck in their throat or like they are choking. GERD can also cause a dry cough and bad breath.\nWhat are the complications of GERD?\nGERD can lead to other medical problems such as ulcers and strictures of the esophagus (esophagitis), cough, asthma, throat and laryngeal inflammation, inflammation and infection of the lungs, and collection of fluid in the sinuses and middle ear. GERD can also cause a change in the esophageal lining called Barrett's esophagus, which is a serious complication that can lead to cancer.\nWhat causes GERD?\nPhysical causes of GERD can include: a malfunctioning or abnormal lower esophageal sphincter muscle (LES), hiatal hernia, abnormal esophageal contractions, and slow emptying of the stomach.\nLifestyle factors that contribute to GERD include:\n● alcohol use● obesity● pregnancy● smoking\nCertain foods can contribute to GERD, such as:● citrus fruits● chocolate● caffeinated drinks● fatty and fried foods● garlic and onions● mint flavorings (especially peppermint)● spicy foods● tomato-based foods, like spaghetti sauce, chili, and pizza\nWhen should I see a doctor?\nIf you experience heartburn more than twice a week, frequent chest pains after eating, trouble swallowing, persistent nausea, and cough or sore throat unrelated to illness, you may have GERD. For proper diagnosis and treatment, you should be evaluated by a physician.\nHow can my ENT help?\nOtolaryngologists, or ear, nose, and throat doctors, and have extensive experience with the tools that diagnose GERD and they are specialists in the treatment of many of the complications of GERD, including: sinus and ear infections, throat and laryngeal inflammation, Barrett’s esophagus, and ulcerations of the esophagus.\nHow is GERD diagnosed?\nGERD can be diagnosed or evaluated by clinical observation and the patient’s response to a trial of treatment with medication. In some cases other tests may be needed including: an endoscopic examination (a long tube with a camera inserted into the esophagus), biopsy, x-ray, examination of the throat and larynx, 24 hour esophageal acid testing, esophageal motility testing (manometry), emptying studies of the stomach, and esophageal acid perfusion (Bernstein test). Endoscopic examination, biopsy, and x-ray may be performed as an outpatient in a hospital setting. Light sedation may be used for endoscopic examinations.\nWhile most people with GERD respond to a combination of lifestyle changes and medication. Occasionally, surgery is recommended.\nLifestyle changes include: losing weight, quitting smoking, wearing loose clothing around the waist, raising the head of your bed (so gravity can help keep stomach acid in the stomach), eating your last meal of the day three hours before bed, and limiting certain foods such as spicy and high fat foods, caffeine, alcohol.\nMedications your doctor may prescribe for GERD include: antacids (such as Tums, Rolaids, etc.), histamine antagonists (H2 blockers such as Tagamet,), proton pump inhibitors (such as Prilosec, Prevacid, Aciphex, Protonix, and Nexium), pro-motility drugs (Reglan), and foam barriers (Gaviscon). Some of these products are now available over-the-counter and do not require a prescription.\nSurgical treatment includes: fundoplication, a procedure where a part of the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophagus to tighten the LES, and endoscopy, where hand stitches or a laser is used to make the LES tighter.\nAre there long-term health problems associated with GERD?\nGERD may damage the lining of the esophagus, thereby causing inflammation (esophagitis), although usually it does not. Barrett's esophagus is a pre-cancerous condition that requires periodic endoscopic surveillance for the development of cancer.\nFor more information on GERD or to find an otolaryngologist near you, visit www.entnet.org.""]"	['<urn:uuid:6c215068-fb9c-4b4a-9514-f2f9dea5fbf1>', '<urn:uuid:c4e4feb9-ca7a-44e0-8fc3-6825db5e91f6>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	9	72	1579
43	How do IoT networks work today, and what challenges will they face as they grow?	Currently, IoT networks operate on a centralized server/client model that handles authentication and connection of devices. While this works for networks with thousands of devices, it will become a bottleneck when billions of devices need to connect. Future IoT networks will need to decentralize, using solutions like fog computing where smart devices handle time-critical operations, and peer-to-peer communications where devices authenticate directly without a broker. This is especially important as IoT becomes ingrained in all aspects of our lives, from homes and healthcare to transportation and cities, with tens of billions of interconnected devices.	"[""Applying Ancient Wisdom to Help Manage Modern RisksMay 11, 2015\nToday, it is probably impossible to identify all of the vulnerabilities in an interconnected information system. In a CyberPhysicalHuman world, where tens of billions of devices will be used in all aspects of our lives—homes, healthcare, transportation, factories, appliances, entertainment, work, cities, farms, and even our clothing—identifying every vulnerability will be impossible. For an organization, a threat-informed approach to risk management facilitates its ability to bring focus to what could otherwise be a boundless problem.\nAlthough Sun Tzu didn't have to deal with cyber adversaries, his ancient wisdom can help focus the actions of today's defenders: understand the enemy. In today's CyberPhysicalHuman world, heeding Sun Tzu's advice means we need to adopt a more threat-based focus.\nThis is especially true when addressing today's sophisticated threat actors. Often called the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), they are not a few isolated individuals sitting in basements. APTs are organizations who recruit, train, equip, and manage a cyber attack team. APTs create campaigns to achieve specific goals—to gain access, escalate privileges, hide their presence, maintain their presence—and to take action to achieve their goals. These campaigns often have patterns. When necessary, the APTs adjust their behaviors in response to our actions. Mindful and prepared defenders observe and learn these campaigns and behaviors, and then intercede.\nTherefore, to better understand sophisticated attackers we need to:\n- Place greater focus on understanding and sharing information about threat patterns—analyzing knowledge gained from multiple, discrete attacks.\n- Reduce the likelihood of future attack success by aligning our defenses and associated vulnerability mitigations to the actual threats and campaigns we face.\nThe security community recently has been taking important steps towards a more threat-based focus. A few years ago, Lockheed Martin came up with the cyber kill chain model. This model has helped many organizations think in more sophisticated ways about how to understand adversaries by watching them before and, equally important, after they enter networks. Defenders can now watch their adversaries and learn about their behaviors and tools.\nUsing this information, astute defenders capture, assess, and make informed decisions about defensive actions. As a result, defenders could turn what initially seemed to be an unbounded problem of trying to mitigate potentially countless vulnerabilities into a more manageable set of challenges, allowing organizations to align their defense postures accordingly.\nTo be clear, mitigating vulnerabilities remains a good idea, but we need to understand the limitations of focusing exclusively on vulnerability identification and mitigation. First, as CyberPhysicalHuman systems become increasingly complex and interconnected, the sheer number of vulnerabilities will always outnumber the ability to identify and plug the holes. We also know that liability and fiduciary concerns can discourage organizations from sharing information about vulnerabilities in their own systems. Additionally, sophisticated attackers tend to apply a long-term focus on high-value targets through ongoing, evolving campaigns that adapt to vulnerability mitigations.\nThis means that a comprehensive defense strategy combines vulnerability reduction with a threat-based approach, based on an understanding of what is most important to protect. A comprehensive defense strategy must also be informed by the reality that bad things can still happen. To that end, our next article will start to address resilience in the CyberPhysicalHuman world.\nThis post is part of a continuing series that will look at the CyberPhysicalHuman world from three perspectives: convergence, risk and resilience:\n- The CyberPhysicalHuman World of Homeland Security\n- Convergence: A Recent History\n- Risk: Focus On Your Main Thing(s)\n- Applying Ancient Wisdom to Help Manage Modern Risks\n- Resilience Is a Team Sport\n- Resilience, Moving Beyond Sectors\n- Enabling Effective Collaboration with Shared Threat Information\n- Wrapping It Up and Moving Forward\n- Coming Closer and Closer to You\n- More Ancient Wisdom for Today's CyberPhysicalHuman World\n- There is No One-Size Fits All Approach to the CyberPhysicalHuman World"", '4 Major Technical Challenges Facing IoT Developers\nIt’s IoT Week at SitePoint! All week we’re publishing articles focused on the intersection of the internet and the physical world, so keep checking the IoT tag for the latest updates.\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is taking the world by storm. The millions of connected sensors and smart devices that are being deployed on a daily basis in homes, offices, cities and even on our persons are creating unprecedented opportunities in cutting costs, reducing energy consumption, improving efficiency and customer services, and better understanding how we interact with our environment.\nThe IoT, hailed as one of the biggest breakthroughs in the history of the tech industry, will soon be an inherent part of every aspect of our lives, from retail shops to hotels, to cars and airplanes and practically everything we interact with.\nBut this added utility comes with its own set of caveats and requirements, which need to be met and overcome with the proper solutions and approaches. Here are four challenges to expect in the future.\nIoT has already turned into a serious security concern that has drawn the attention of prominent tech firms and government agencies across the world. The hacking of baby monitors, smart fridges, Barbie dolls, drug infusion pumps, cameras and even assault rifles are portending a security nightmare being caused by the future of IoT. So many new nodes being added to networks and the internet will provide malicious actors with innumerable attack vectors and possibilities to carry out their evil deeds, especially since a considerable number of them suffer from security holes.\nThe more important shift in security will come from the fact that IoT will become more ingrained in our lives. Concerns will no longer be limited to the protection of sensitive information and assets. Our very lives and health can become the target of IoT hack attacks, as was shown in the hacking of pacemakers. Critical city infrastructure can also become a target, as the Ukraine power grid hack warned us last year.\nThere are many reasons behind the state of insecurity in IoT. Some of it has to do with the industry being in its “gold rush” state, where every vendor is hastily seeking to dish out the next innovative connected gadget before competitors do. Under such circumstances, functionality becomes the main focus and security takes a back seat.\nAlso, many IoT developers often come from an embedded systems programming background and are ignorant of the threats of IoT programming. They don’t necessarily have the knowhow and expertise to program for the hostile connected environment of the internet, and end up dishing out code that is reliable from a functionality perspective, but can easily be exploited remotely.\nScalability issues also contribute to the creation insecure IoT products. The fact is that many security solutions being used today have been created with generic computing devices in mind. IoT devices often lack the computational power, storage capacity and even proper operating system to be able to deploy such solutions.\nSome of the data that IoT devices collect are very sensitive and are protected by legislations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the U.S. and are fundamentally different from our browsing and clicking habits. Yet the necessary precautions aren’t taken when storing the data or sharing it with other service providers. Vendors and manufacturers must either discard this data or remove the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to make sure that consumers aren’t damaged in case of data breaches.\nAnother consideration to take is that while data generated about a single appliance (such as a smart toaster) might not be sensitive per-se, yet when combined with data from other devices, it can reveal information such as the consumer’s life pattern, which can become very damaging if they fall into the hands of the wrong people. In many cases, criminals don’t even need to pry into your encrypted communications in order to obtain the information they want. A study by LGS Innovations elaborates on this issue and presents a DIY solution to protect IoT traffic and privacy.\nConnecting so many devices will be one of the biggest challenges of the future of IoT, and it will defy the very structure of current communication models and the underlying technologies. At present we rely on the centralized, server/client paradigm to authenticate, authorize and connect different nodes in a network.\nThis model is sufficient for current IoT ecosystems, where tens, hundreds or even thousands of devices are involved. But when networks grow to join billions and hundreds of billions of devices, centralized brokered systems will turn into a bottleneck. Such systems will require huge investments and spending in maintaining cloud servers that can handle such large amounts of information exchange, and entire systems can go down if the server becomes unavailable.\nThe future of IoT will very much have to depend on decentralizing IoT networks. Part of it can become possible by moving functionality to the edge, such as using fog computing models where smart devices such as IoT hubs take charge of time-critical operations and cloud servers take on data gathering and analytical responsibilities.\nOther solutions involve the use of peer-to-peer communications, where devices identify and authenticate each other directly and exchange information without the involvement of a broker. Networks will be created in meshes with no single point of failure. This model will have its own set of challenges, especially from a security perspective, but these challenges can be met with some of the emerging IoT technologies such as the Phantom protocol, or leveraging the success of other tried and tested models such as the blockchain.\nCompatibility and Longevity Challenges\nAs an industry that is going through its baby steps, IoT is growing in many different directions, with many different technologies competing to become the standard. For instance, we currently have ZigBee, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) all vying to become the dominant transport mechanism between devices and hubs. This will cause difficulties and require the deployment of extra hardware and software when connecting devices.\nOther compatibility issues stem from non-unified cloud services, lack of standardized M2M protocols and diversities in firmware and operating systems among IoT devices.\nSome of these technologies will eventually become obsolete in the next few years, effectively rendering the devices implementing them useless. This is especially important, since in contrast to generic computing devices which have a lifespan of a few years, IoT appliances (such as smart fridges or TVs) tend to remain in service for much longer, and should be able to function even if their manufacturer goes out of service.\nI’ve already discussed how the concept of abstraction and separation of concerns can help overcome many of the compatibility challenges that lie ahead in the evolution of IoT. Other notable efforts in this regard include the creation of platforms such as Afero and the Apple’s HomeKit, which enable developers to focus on functionality while letting the platform take care of communication and security.']"	['<urn:uuid:c96a20fc-a01f-4a3b-bfae-4f9ba1e35e79>', '<urn:uuid:53af1451-e7de-43a8-a040-ad42386e66b2>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	15	94	1810

45	i am software developer how unit testing fits agile methodology process advantages disadvantages explain	As a software developer, unit testing integrates with Agile methodology in several ways. In Agile environments, unit testing becomes part of the continuous testing process, where testing is integrated directly into development to find bugs early and often. Unit testing supports this by allowing developers to validate individual code components before integration. The advantages include early defect detection, cost savings, and easier bug fixing at the initial stages. However, there are challenges when combining these approaches. While Agile emphasizes rapid iteration and flexibility, unit testing requires careful planning and isolated testing environments. Some disadvantages include the time needed to create comprehensive test cases, the challenge of maintaining test suites during rapid development cycles, and the potential confusion in team hierarchy when everyone performs testing. For effective integration, it's important to establish clear testing processes, use appropriate testing frameworks, and ensure proper collaboration between development and testing teams.	"[""Agile testing is any test which occurs to support an agile methodology. Below we break down some of the best practices for agile testing in software. If you want to start testing in agile with Global App Testing, you can get in touch here.\nAgile testing has become a critical part of application lifecycles and has had a significant impact on software development, testing and quality assurance. It has also gained widespread acceptance as a crucial driver for the delivery of high-quality products. In this article, we take a deep dive into the world of Agile testing to better understand how it works and how it can help you.\nIn order to understand agile testing, it’s important to understand what the Agile development methodology involves. It’s an umbrella term, encompassing many practices that are quite different from traditional development techniques.\nLet’s start by looking at the key principles of agile software development. The four core values are:\nAs the name implies, an Agile methodology is focused on responding to change. There are many frameworks teams might use, such as Scrum or Kanban, but at the center of it is a collaborative approach.\nA traditional development approach might separate team members based on the area they’re working on, and slowly add pieces together to create a finished product. With Agile, continuous integration is key - the whole team collaborates and new features are added as they work. It creates a completely different software development life cycle - which is why teams need to implement agile testing methods to help.\nOur definition of agile testing is testing which occurs in and is appropriate to an agile software development environment. Many of the kinds of testing which are appropriate for other software development methodologies are suitable for agile testing – regression testing, feature testing, and so forth. But their methodology – how they fit with the software release cycle; the way that the tests are planned and success is understood – is often different. Global App Testing provides tester supply which is elastic and which entails a rapid turnaround, meaning you can expand your team instantly in the case of tests which can’t be automated.\nAgile testing operates under the philosophy that continuous testing is a crucial part of development, on a par with coding.\nIn Agile, testing is integrated directly into the development process so that bugs are discovered as early and as often as possible. As a result, testers can identify problems at every point in the development process, moving the product quickly towards release.\nTo keep things from breaking in the customers’ hands, testers attempt to break it first - and then have it fixed.\nIn the traditional waterfall method of development, the sequence of events is:\nRequirements > System Design > Implementation > Integration and Testing > Deployment of System > Maintenance.\nThe Agile Testing Life Cycle is an iterative process that aligns with the overall Agile software development life cycle. It includes various phases that focus on continuous testing, collaboration, and improvement. Here's a breakdown of the Agile Testing Life Cycle:\nThe Agile Testing Life Cycle iterates through these phases in alignment with the development sprints, promoting continuous improvement, rapid feedback, and ongoing collaboration. This approach allows the team to adapt to changes and deliver high-quality software throughout the development process.\nThere are three simple benefits to adopting Agile testing: a happier team, a higher-quality product and faster delivery. But that trifecta is worth the effort put into developing an effective Agile testing framework.\nHowever, no system is perfect. Improperly implemented, Agile testing can weaken team structure and product development, preventing a viable product from ever being released. Even when properly used, all Agile methodologies have their weaknesses. For example, exploratory testing can lack the structure necessary to ensure a product is comprehensively tested; ATDD accounts for customer feedback, but not for business outcomes.\nThe emphasis Agile testing places on people can also be its downfall. If Agile testers are excluded from the team that they need to be closely integrated with, they are rendered useless. If a single skilled Agile tester leaves, it can prove to be a major setback for the development of the product.\nFinally, since everyone in the team performs testing, the muddied hierarchy could lead to confusion and conflict. Methodologies like Scrum attempt to circumvent this by having ‘scrum masters’, but this has the potential to fall back into a more traditional method rather than staying truly Agile.\nWhile Agile methodologies offer numerous benefits for software development, they also have some disadvantages when it comes to testing. Here are a few potential drawbacks of testing in Agile:\nIt's important to note that these disadvantages are not inherent to Agile methodologies themselves but rather potential challenges that can arise if testing is not effectively managed within an Agile context. With proper planning, collaboration, and adaptation, many of these drawbacks can be mitigated.\nWith dedication, each of these pitfalls can be overcome and the three powerful benefits experienced. The first step towards successful Agile testing is determining when Agile testing should not be used. Blind adoption of Agile testing can result in a weak, crash-prone product.\nHere are a few guidelines for cases in which Agile may not be the best way to test:\nOnce you have determined that Agile testing will benefit your team, your product and your customers, you should spend as much time as necessary to pick the right methodology and to create a process for testing using the four-quadrant model.\nTo counteract the possibility of testers' exclusion, testers should work in as close physical proximity to the developers as possible. They should meet with them often to see what they are currently working on and to give them a chance to review the tests that have been developed. Taking an iterative approach here, as well as in the testing process itself, can help connect the teams early and help with later collaboration.\nTesters can open doors for themselves by providing useful feedback based on interactions with both developers and customers. In short, they should make themselves indispensable to developers in order to be able to perform their job well.\nThe greatest thing that can be done to ensure the success of Agile testing for a product is to hire people who have the essential characteristics of an Agile tester, and to build a culture of self-organisation and independent thinking in the entire organisation.\nThat environment will naturally result in ‘stable infra’ without sacrificing speed, resulting in happier workers delivering a better, more valuable product - faster - to a satisfied customer.\nTesting in an agile environment, it's important to focus on metrics that provide meaningful insights into the quality, progress, and effectiveness of testing activities. Here are some of the most appropriate metrics to consider:\nTest Coverage: This metric measures the extent to which the test cases cover the requirements and functionality of the system. It helps identify gaps in test coverage and ensures that critical areas are adequately tested.\nDefect Density: Defect density measures the number of defects identified per unit of code or functionality. It helps assess the effectiveness of testing by indicating how many defects are found in relation to the amount of tested code.\nTest Execution Progress: This metric tracks the progress of test execution within a sprint or iteration. It provides visibility into the percentage of test cases executed and helps identify any bottlenecks or delays in testing activities.\nTest Execution Efficiency: This metric measures the ratio of passed tests to the total number of tests executed. It indicates the efficiency of the testing process by highlighting how many tests are passing successfully and how many are failing.\nCycle Time: Cycle time measures the time it takes for a user story or a task to move through the entire testing process, from creation to completion. It helps identify bottlenecks and optimize the testing workflow.\nDefect Turnaround Time: This metric measures the time taken to identify, report, fix, and retest a defect. It helps assess the effectiveness of defect management and the overall responsiveness of the team in addressing issues.\nCustomer Satisfaction: Although not directly related to testing, customer satisfaction is a crucial metric to gauge the quality of the product. Feedback from customers and stakeholders can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of testing efforts.\nAgile Test Velocity: Test velocity measures the rate at which testing tasks or user stories are completed within an iteration. It helps the team understand their capacity for testing and provides insights into the progress of testing activities.\nEscaped Defects: Escaped defects are defects that are identified by customers or end-users after the software has been released. Tracking and analyzing escaped defects helps identify areas of improvement in testing and quality assurance processes.\nRemember, metrics should be used judiciously and in conjunction with qualitative assessments. It's crucial to select metrics that align with the project goals, adapt them as needed, and use them as a tool for continuous improvement rather than as mere performance indicators."", 'How Many Types Of Unit Testing Are There?\nConsidered the first level of software testing life cycle (STLC), unit testing is performed before executing integration tests. This testing aims to validate the correctness and completeness of the smallest component of the software- Unit, the smallest possible testable part of the software that can accept and produce and output, respectively. Integration occurs to enable these units to form the modules or the system.\nThis process, performed by a selected group of software developers, unit testing, involves the evaluation of each unit before it is integrated into the system. These units are verified and validated based on specified requirements by security testing them in isolation to identify, analyze and fix defects.\nTable of Content:\n- The necessity of unit testing\n- Kinds of unit testing\n- How unit testing is done\n- Techniques used in unit testing\n- Obstacles faced\n- Advantages and disadvantages\n- Unit testing Framework and tools\n- What to consider in unit testing\nThe Necessity Of Unit Testing\nIt is effective testing, which may prove economical in the software development process, in comparison to detecting the defects present in the integrated system is a lot more complicated. In contrast, it is easier to find the bugs and defects in the smaller units. This Early detection of the bugs in the development process enables the developer to be able to fix them at the initial stage of the development process, thereby saving both time and cost of the project.\nAdditionally, with the assistance of this testing technique, the team of software developers can tackle various issues that are related to the software product, as it is focused on:\n- It helps you Handle errors and defects.\n- It helps you Ensure the functional correctness and completeness of the software product.\n- It helps you Check input values and correct output data.\n- It helps you Optimize algorithms and performance testing.\n- It helps you identify, analyze, and rectify defects.\nUnit Testing Features\nThe objective is to test each unit of the software product independently; thus, this testing is executed during the first or initial stage of software testing in the development cycle. This testing is an integral part of computer programming and is utilized to evaluate the individual units of the product’s open source code.\nThe other features of this technique include:\n- It is Performed before the integration testing; unit testing is also referred to as component testing.\n- Load testing is a component of test-driven development.\n- It also forms the foundation of extreme programming, as it excessively relies on automated unit test frameworks.\n- Evaluate individual units of the software product.\n- The software developers write the test and run the test for testing so they can validate the compliance of the software code with its design alongside ensuring its intended function.\n- It may also include techniques such as walk-through, review, and inspection of programming code.\n- Demands strict possible test plans may also be needed for each isolated unit to produce effective results.\n- Usually, automated testing is preferred for this testing type. However, manual testing can also be used for this type of testing.\n- It will require plenty of time and patience on your part to focus and perform testing on each unit.\n- You are provided with access to an effective testing approach to trace & resolve the errors in the programming code base at an earlier stage.\n- It helps you save time and cost of finding and resolving the error at a later complex stage.\nHow Unit Testing Is Done\nAlthough the unit testing process is generally performed by the software developers or their peers, in some rare cases, this may also be executed by a team of testers. Whether the system testing is performed manually or through automated tools, it follows a set process, which usually consists of the following activities:\n- Defining and creating Unit Test Plans.\n- Unit test cases are designed and prepared based on the specified test plans.\n- There is the execution of these test cases on individual units.\n- Fix bugs (if any are found), and re-evaluate the unit.\n- This cycle of Testing keeps on repeating until the unit gets rid of all the bugs.\nKinds Of Unit Testing\nThere are three types of testing that can help the unit testers test each source code unit in isolation. Each of these types of unit testing caters to different requirements of the software and ensures its proper functioning. The types of unit testing include:\nBlack Box Testing: This type of testing that enables the team to test the software’s user interface and its input and output. The tester is usually conscious of internal functionality in this kind of testing. It is the internal structure of an item or function to be tested is that is justify unknown to them.\nWhite Box Testing: The White box testing is an important type of testing that is utilized by the developers who want to test the functional behavior of the software product and validate its execution.\nGray Box Testing: Is the third type of testing, gray box testing, is utilized to execute test suite and test cases, test various test methods, and perform a risk assessment.\nIt’s referred to as semi-transparent Testing. It is a combination of White Box and Black box testing. This combination is the type of testing in which the tester is aware of a method or unit’s internal functionality, but not at a more profound level like white box testing. In this, the (user acceptance testing) user is partially aware of the internal functionality of a system. Various types of Testing coverage under a Gray box testing is mentioned as follows –\n- Matrix testing.\n- Pattern Testing.\n- Orthogonal Pattern testing.\n- Regression Testing.\nTechniques Used In Unit Testing\nDevelopers can execute the process of unit testing with the assistance of three important techniques, which are:\nA white box testing technique utilizes the knowledge of the software system’s internal implementation and structure to design and create test cases. Then during the testing, the testers should have in-depth knowledge of the code coverage to facilitate test execution; thus, it is performed by the team of developers, with the assistance of the following methods:\n- Branch Testing.\n- Path Testing.\n- Condition Testing.\n- Expression Testing.\n- Statement Testing.\nFunctional Testing Technique\nPerformed to validate the software product’s functionality and ensure it behaves in an intended manner; the team executes functionality testing. It is a black-box testing technique that involves the following:\n- Equivalence Partitioning.\n- Boundary Value.\n- Syntax Checking.\n- Input domain testing.\nError Based Techniques\nThe Issues that are present in a code can be best tracked by the individual who designed it. For this, error-based techniques are used, which allow the team to identify defects, bugs, and other discrepancies in the software. It involves:\n- Fault Seeding.\n- Mutation Testing.\n- Historical Test Data.\nWhat Can I Do With Them?\nHammers are great tools to help you with various jobs — opening car windows or turning off alarm clocks. They can do many different things; they should probably only do a few. However, they are especially well suited to putting nails through hard surfaces. Tests are similar.\nTest-Driven Development, also called TDD, is a code design technique where the programmer writes a test before any production code is done and then writes the code that will make that test pass. The idea is that you gain a tiny bit of assurance that you have from that initial test / smoke test you do; the programmer can feel free to refactor and refactor some more to get the cleanest code that they know how to write. The idea is rather simple, but like most simple things, the execution is complex. TDD requires an entirely different mindset from what most developers are used to, as well as the tenacity required to deal with a learning curve that may slow you down at first.\nHelps you in Checking Your Work\nTDD is not new, but at this point, it is still mainly for the go-getters. Most of us are checking our work. After writing the production code, writing unit tests is the more traditional way of doing things, but it is no less valuable. It may also be something you are more familiar with if you have been in a math class any time in the past decade.\nAfter your work has been checked and it is clear that the code is doing what you think it is doing, it is normal that the value of the tests changes a little bit. Tests that can be efficiently run with every build of your product act as change detection, notifying you or your team when code changes in unexpected ways.\nHelps with the Code Documentation\nCode documentation is often a drag, and it shows mostly how little code documentation gets written. Component testing (beta testing) can help make the documentation burden a little easier by encouraging better coding practices and leaving behind code pieces that describe what your product is doing. Rather than constantly feeding the documentation beast with a code change, you will be updating a system of checks working for you or your team instead.\nAvoid the Danger Zone\nThere are minimal uses of unit testing techniques that you will want to avoid when possible—creating integration tests that You can do cross-system borders and touch databases or 3rd party systems quickly results in a test suite that takes a long time to run with each added test. There are several test frameworks out there that specialize in higher-level Testing. When you want to test larger pieces of your product at a time, you might want to investigate those other frameworks.\nOne other risky area is an end to end tests. These usually require you to order carefully, dependencies on other tests, and a detailed setup to get your system in a particular ‘test ready’ state. Much like integration testing, there are several automation tools to choose from made just for this purpose. You can do these things with unit frameworks, but it might quickly become more work than it is worth.\nObstacles faced : While executing the component testing process, the team can encounter various issues and challenges, hindering the smooth testing and inhibiting the team from developing expected results. Several of the challenges witnessed by the testers include:\n- They face Uncertainties or Trouble With Test Names: Names that don’t reflect the intent of the Testing or miscommunicate the test type can increase the challenge of Testing for your team. Furthermore, it can also increase confusion among team members, which further impacts the Testing of the software.\n- Challenges in Understanding the Entire Code: Software development requires excessive coding, and understanding the entirety of the code can be extremely difficult and tedious for the developers. Furthermore, it can delay the process of testing and product release.\n- Facing Problems With the Test Doubles: In this case, if the mock codes require more Testing than the production code, then this is a good indicator that there is an issue in the product, as these mock objects aim to simplify the process of Testing.\n- Being able to Find Dependencies: Finding dependencies in the software product can be a hassle-free task, hindering the testing process.\n- If they have Frequent debugging of Tests: Debugging is a complex task that requires great effort and time. Hence, if the tests fail constantly and it is often required that testing and debugging occur, it can increase the software’s challenges.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Unit Testing\nOne can gather a proper understanding of a process by getting an insight into its advantages and disadvantages. Ergo, to help you better understand unit testing, here are its advantages and disadvantages.\n|The Benefits of Unit Testing:||Disadvantages of Component Testing:|\nHow to Adopt Unit Testing?\nUnit test cases are automated software testing but still created manually; for you to do Testing with a testing automated approach, the following steps will need to be considered – You can write another piece of code in your application to test a function (application testing). To do this, unit test cases were created. Later on, this section of code was finally removed to test code when an application is complete or when an application is working.\nIsolation of a code: This Isolate function is put to the test more rigorously. The code can do Automated Unit Testing in a better way. Isolating functions/code aids in Testing in a good way. Because it helps to reveal dependencies between code functions, you can use the Test framework for developing automated test cases. During cases, the framework display logs for failed cases. Nowadays, many frameworks automatically flag and report failed cases in summary. Depending upon failure, failure may halt subsequent testing.\nUnit Testing Framework and Tools\nOne of the most critical advantages of unit testing is that it is often executed with the aid of testing tools and frameworks, which increase its effectiveness and efficiency. For instance, stubs. The benefits of utilizing a unit testing tool are numerous: from making the process agile and robust to helping the team get accurate results. Because tools are an essential part of unit testing, we have listed some of the most popular unit testing tools available to you in the IT industry/market.\nHence, the popular unit testing tools include:\n- REST Assured.\n- Quilt HTTP.\n- Spock Framework.\nWhat to Consider in Unit Testing\nWhile performing unit testing, there are manifold aspects that need proper consideration and monitoring to validate the quality, effectiveness, and accuracy of Testing. Hence, here are some critical things you should consider while executing uni testing:\n- Testing should be performed independently; this is done to ensure that any modifications and changes that are implemented in the software requirements are not affecting the unit test cases.\n- The test execution process needs to be concentrated on one code at a time.\n- Any of the bugs and defects detected by the team during the testing process should be resolved and fixed before there is any commencement of the next phase of the software testing life cycle (STLC).\n- Your Test cases need to be both comprehensive and understandable.\n- Your testing environment needs to be isolated from the development environment in unit testing.\n- You and your team should find an appropriate and effective tool for the process of Testing.\n- Perform rigorous and frequent unit tests.']"	['<urn:uuid:6f1ef25d-80e7-4d97-9bdc-e494651ff67d>', '<urn:uuid:79c841ef-08da-451d-a520-83b8262e0b0c>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	14	147	3936
46	How do the Circle of Innovation and Three Little Pigs PBL approaches compare in problem identification?	Both approaches emphasize problem identification as a crucial first step, but implement it differently. The Three Little Pigs PBL approach defines a specific problem (building a wolf-proof house), while the Circle of Innovation uses a broader 'Observation & Interpretation' phase for problem identification. Both methods are structured processes that can be used in educational settings to promote innovative thinking and problem-solving.	"['Unique Problem-Based Learning for the K-12 Classroom\nA few weeks ago, a couple members of the Advancement Courses team attended the National Science Teachers Association’s (NSTA) annual conference. In addition to meeting thousands of excellent educators, the team had the chance to conduct a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) demo. Read on to learn more about the demo and how you can apply it in your classroom.\nPBL with Fairytales and Fables\nThe engineering design process is an effective way to engage students of all grade levels in hands-on, problem-based learning that promotes STEM thinking. Sometimes, though, it can be difficult to think of unique and interesting topics to get your students excited about the work.\nEnter the story of The Three Little Pigs.\nYou can use the story of The Three Little Pigs (or just about any fable or fairytale) to design your own PBL STEM project that will not only be interesting for your students, but will also teach them important 21st century STEM skills that will benefit them for life.\nHere’s one example of how to use the engineering design process with the story of The Three Little Pigs in your STEM lessons across grade levels. Feel free to reference the Engineering Design Process Printable as we move through the steps.\nProblem-Based Learning With The Three Little Pigs\nIntroduce your students to the story of The Three Little Pigs. Then, walk them through the following steps:\n1. Define a problem:\nThe three little pigs need to build a home that can withstand the big bad wolf’s huffing and puffing.\n2. Identify what is needed to solve the problem:\nThe pigs will need building materials that are solid enough to protect them from the wolf.\n3. Brainstorm solutions\nStudents break into groups and choose their building materials (construction paper, toothpicks, popsicle sticks, binder clips, glue, scotch tape, markers, and scissors). Students then brainstorm how to build the sturdiest home.\n4. Create and test the best solution:\nStudents build the product and then test it using a mid-sized fan on low, medium, and high settings (i.e., the big bad wolf’s intensifying huffing and puffing).\n5. Evaluate results:\nStudents collaborate as a team to figure out what changes need to be made to make their home sturdier.\n6. Improve the solution:\nThey then make any necessary revisions to their product.\n7. Share results:\nAt the end of class, each group has an opportunity to test their product against the fan at high power and explain their brainstorming and building process.\nThe educators who attended the workshop at NSTA loved learning how to use fables and fairytales to implement inquiry-based STEM instruction. Below are the innovative, sturdy, and quirky structures each of the groups built, all of which passed the test from the “big bad wolf.”\nTo make this activity more challenging for older grades, or to extend the learning across subjects, you can make the following changes:\nModifications and Connections Across Content Areas\n- Limit the number of materials students can use to build their structure, or give them a budget when purchasing materials. (Older/gifted students)\n- Set up a store so younger students can practice financial literacy and math skills as they purchase building materials. (Math)\n- Connect building materials to regional natural resources and discuss how the climate/topography of an area might affect the kinds of structures people build. (Science/Social Studies)\n- Ask students to develop blueprints or sketches of their structures before building them by using free digital tools or modeling software. (Technology/Art)\n- Introduce vocabulary to support literacy skills and encourage students to develop their own endings to the fairytales. (ELA)\n- Ask students to develop arguments as to why they chose certain materials and use evidence to support their claims. (ELA)', 'Circle of Innovation\nA didactic model for teachers in any sector of education; the Circle of Innovation describes the four phases involved in the development of new tools. It is based on design thinking and can help teachers and learning material designers organize and structure complex entrepreneurial learning.\nPurpose and process\nThe model can be used for analysing innovation processes as well as for structuring intended innovation processes such as new materials/tools. The four phases in the Circle of Innovation are:\n- Identifying a problem (Observation & Interpretation)\n- Creation (Innovative vision & Innovative concrete ideas)\n- Experiment (Action & Exploration)\n- Implementation (Situational & Distributive).\nParticipants in the model will sometimes goes through the phases in a linear fashion, but more often they circle back and forth between them. Each phase has its challenges which can potentially prevent an innovation from emerging.\nIn an educational context, using the Circle of Innovation can enable teachers and learning material designers to develop well structured learning material which helps to set students\' creative potential free and at the same time supports them in the complex processes of entrepreneurial learning.\nCurricular or thematic relevance\nAppropriate in the development of new resources for any learning context\nHow to organise:\nAssessment and evaluation approaches\nFully integrated into the process itself\nNot applicable.

47	Having spent years in competitive gaming, I'd like to know what scientific evidence exists about gaming's impact on intelligence development, and what measures can prevent gaming-related physical strain?	Studies demonstrate positive impacts on intelligence, with research at the Karolinska Institutet finding children who played more video games gained 2.5 IQ points over two years, likely due to sustained attention and problem-solving requirements. For physical health maintenance, experts recommend preventive measures including regular movement breaks, yoga stretches (particularly sun salutations that work multiple body parts), proper ergonomic setup to avoid nerve pinching, and standing during loading screens. Additionally, implementing exercise breaks during streams and maintaining awareness of body discomfort can help prevent serious physical issues.	"['Video video games have been accused of many issues through the years. There have been issues that they make us remoted and delinquent, and in flip injury our psychological wellbeing. We have now fearful that some video games make us extra violent, due to this fact damaging our bodily wellbeing (actually).\nAs scientists have change into more proficient at researching these subjects, the most effective proof has began to disclose that these types of worries are largely unfounded.\nNonetheless, there persists a deep-seated concept that enjoying them rots your mind – it’s straightforward to view them as an unproductive waste of time which displace different, extra significant pursuits. However in actuality, is the alternative the case? May video video games make us smarter?\nFor years, ‘brain-training’ video games and apps have been touted as a simple and efficient strategy to enhance our cognitive talents. The thought behind them is that by enjoying a sequence of quickfire puzzles that target issues like reminiscence or spatial consciousness, over time our talents in these areas will enhance – and in principle, so will our normal intelligence.\nFrom a analysis perspective, the important thing subject has been in determining whether or not enjoying these types of video games ends in ‘switch’ results – particularly, whether or not enhancing your expertise on a given reminiscence recreation brings about cognitive enhancements extra broadly.\nExtra particularly, scientists have tried to make a distinction between ‘close to’ and ‘far’ switch results: close to results relate as to if enjoying one reminiscence recreation ends in enhancements in different reminiscence video games, whereas far results relate as to if enjoying that recreation ends in a normal enchancment in cognitive talents or intelligence.\nExtra like this\nWhereas some research have proven that brain-training video games lead to close to results, these are usually weak, and different research fail to seek out that very same end result. And as for much results, there’s no convincing proof this occurs.\nNevertheless, one line of enquiry has in contrast brain-training video games to run-of-the-mill video video games, and that is the place issues get attention-grabbing. In a 2015 research evaluating the brain-training recreation Lumosity with the first-person puzzle recreation Portal 2, researchers discovered that Lumosity gamers didn’t present boosts in problem-solving and spatial expertise, however Portal 2 gamers did.\nAlongside related strains, a research of practically 45,000 members revealed in 2019 confirmed that whereas there have been small cognitive advantages of enjoying brain-training video games, these had been negligible compared to the results of video video games generally.\nExtra lately, in 2020, researchers based mostly on the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden checked out information from some 9,000 American kids and located that youngsters aged 9 or 10 who performed video video games for above-average quantities of time didn’t present any variations in intelligence in contrast with those that performed much less.\nThe research caught up with 5,000 of these kids two years later and found that by the age of 12, the children who performed video video games had 2.5 extra IQ factors than common.\nElsewhere, research in older populations have instructed that there are related advantages. For instance, a 2020 research of adults aged 60 to 80 confirmed that enjoying video games like Indignant Birds or Tremendous Mario 3D World resulted in reminiscence enhancements over a four-week timespan.\nWhy off-the-shelf video video games lead to enhancements in cognitive talents over and above extra focused video games isn’t clear, and scientists are nonetheless making an attempt to know why this could be the case.\nOne argument is to do with the period of time invested: whereas brain-training apps are likely to ship mini-games over a brief timespan, video video games are immersive and sometimes require sustained ranges of consideration and problem-solving.\nFurthermore, regardless of some promising findings, the scientific jury remains to be very a lot out as as to if there may be presently sufficient convincing proof to again up the declare that video video games make us smarter.\nWithin the meantime, maybe we are able to depart behind these outdated issues that inform us that video video games are debilitating or maladaptive.\nLearn extra concerning the science of video video games:', 'For most esports athletes and gamers, physical injury isn\'t high on the list of risks they associate with their hobby or career. But a sedentary lifestyle can pose danger with poor circulation, posture and repetitive strain contributing to health problems at what should be an active age. However, there are those hoping to change the habits that lead to such injuries being commonplace, using all tools at their disposal.\nAmber Moss, AKA TheNerd_Wife, is tackling aches and pains in the wider Twitch community by combining her loves of dance, yoga and streaming. We found Amber leading a Yoga For Gamers session at TwitchCon in San Diego this weekend and asked her how to stay fit while streaming and gaming, and find out that Knight Artorias had the answers all along.\nAmber describes herself as a ball of sunshine with a passion for dark horror games, which fits nicely with her interest in yoga: everything in balance. She graduated with a degree in dance and is now turning to the health benefits of an active lifestyle to help those in passive hobbies.\n""As I got older and left performing, yoga seemed like a logical next step for me,"" says Amber. ""It keeps me moving and focused. I realized the gaming community tends to have some not-so-healthy habits & I knew yoga could help, so Yoga For Gamers was born and my mission is to help gamers get healthier and happier through movement and mindfulness.""\nGaming\'s reputation as a less physically demanding pastime has been compounded in recent years by the ease of having a burrito delivered straight to your door through phone apps. However esports athletes are often evangelists when it comes to the importance of taking breaks to head to the gym, as it improves both their physical and mental wellbeing. However not all of us can be paid a lucrative contract to play games and take care of our backs.\n""I personally go to the gym at least three times a week, as well as teaching my yoga classes on stream, but I realize not everyone has that time luxury,"" she says. ""And not everyone is excited about exercise.""\nThe double-edged sword of gaming as a hobby is the necessity to stay sitting for long periods, and if you already have a desk job that takes away even more time from active hours. If you aren\'t aware of your setup\'s ergonomics, holding your wrists at an angle while typing or using WASD can pinch nerves causing carpal tunnel syndrome, and slouching in a desk chair that\'s slightly too high from the ground can lead to back problems which manifest in strange ways throughout the entire body so it can be hard to realize what\'s causing it.\n""No matter what it is you do, paying attention to your body is imperative!"" Amber says. ""Tiny aches can turn into real issues, if not addressed. I always say: Listen to your body while it’s whispering. You won’t like it if you wait til it’s screaming. Postural issues, nerve damage, blood clots, are all scary things. Get up and move regularly!""\nWhen you walk, any one of the joints from the ground to your skull can become inflamed if just one link in the chain is out of alignment. Your knee, your back, your neck, even the bones in your feet. So it\'s important to keep moving and stretching out these joints instead of letting them slip into a painful misalignment.\nWhile it\'s true that many of us would prefer to stay indoors and keep racking up victory royales than head out for a run, Amber believes it doesn\'t always have to be a choice between having fun and staying healthy.\n""I think there can be fun ways to incorporate fitness into streams,"" she says. ""Setting a timer and doing a stretch break with viewers is an option. Using pushups or jumping jacks for tips or bits can be engaging for everyone involved, and joining a Yoga For Gamers stream is also a good time.""\nAmber runs Yoga For Gamers streams as a way to spread wellness through the online streaming community, splicing together gameplay and chat with a guided instructional session of yoga, providing stretches that are precision-targeted for many of the problems that gamers are most at risk of developing.\nWhile getting up from the PC and heading out for a long walk is the best way to make sure you don\'t end up with any problems (most experts recommend at least 30 minutes of exercise a day) it\'s not the only way. Even very small changes to the way you play can help your body out. Amber\'s number one tip is on loading screens or during match making, simply stand up. For games with a longer matchmaking time, you could even touch your toes, do arm circles, do a gentle spinal twist by planting your feet and rotating your upper body, or roll out your wrists to stop yourself getting carpal tunnel.\nBut when it comes to the most effective solution, she always comes back to yoga as a way to carefully and gently get your body back into the correct shape after you\'ve been slouching like a gremlin for 20 rounds of Apex in a row. Turns out Artorias had the right idea.\n""A Yoga Sun Salutation covers a lot of bases!"" she says, invoking the infamous Praise The Sun stance from Dark Souls. ""It gets the blood flowing and works the back, wrists, legs, core, shoulders, neck, and more. It’s an easy pattern of postures and is great to do before, during, and after a stream. You can learn how to do a Sun Salutation during my Yoga For Gamers classes.""\nYou can find Amber on Twitch as TheNerd_Wife where she plays a variety of horror games and teaches you how to downward dog.Load Comments']"	['<urn:uuid:6bd3fdf5-8424-4ff2-841b-1b201832b092>', '<urn:uuid:34b6c62c-4175-4c74-af20-2396875bb697>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	28	86	1675
48	Being a specialist in medical imaging, I'd like to know whether coronary CTA and upper endoscopy both involve the use of contrast medium, and if so, what are the associated risks?	Both procedures may use contrast medium, but with different risks. In coronary CTA, contrast medium is injected intravenously and may cause slight pain and mild allergy with rashes and/or nausea. For upper endoscopy, contrast medium is only used when combined with X-rays in a specific variation called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to diagnose problems affecting the liver, pancreas, gallbladder and bile ducts.

The procedure is also called an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, or EGD.\nA gastrointestinal (GI) doctor (gastroenterologist) uses an endoscope. The scope is a narrow, flexible tube with a light and small video camera. Through the scope, your doctor can view the inside lining of your:\n- Esophagus: The tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach.\n- Stomach: The organ that holds food and starts the digestion process.\n- Duodenum: The upper part of your small intestine.\nWho might need an upper endoscopy?\nYou may need an upper endoscopy if you have unexplained:\n- Abdominal pain.\n- Bleeding in the upper digestive tract.\n- Nausea and vomiting.\n- Swallowing problems.\n- Weight loss.\nWhy do healthcare providers perform upper endoscopies?\nAn upper endoscopy allows for a direct view and biopsies. It can be more accurate than X-rays in diagnosing problems in the upper digestive system. These problems include:\n- Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD) and heartburn.\n- Cancerous and noncancerous tumors.\n- Inflammation, such as esophagitis, gastritis and duodenitis.\n- Gastrointestinal disorders, such as celiac disease and Crohn’s disease.\n- Stomach (peptic) ulcers.\n- Swallowing disorders.\nWhat does an upper endoscopy treat?\nHealthcare providers can also do treatments with an endoscope. Your doctor may also use upper endoscopy to:\n- Control upper digestive tract bleeding.\n- Stretch narrowed digestive tracts.\n- Remove polyps, tumors or swallowed objects.\nWhat other procedures use upper endoscopy?\nYour doctor may combine an upper endoscopy with:\n- X-rays: In endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), doctors combine the two tools with injected dye. ERCP helps diagnose and treat problems that affect the liver, pancreas, gallbladder and bile ducts.\n- Ultrasound: An endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) creates images of the digestive tract. EUS can also show surrounding organs, lymph nodes and tissue.\nWhat should I expect before an upper endoscopy?\nTo help your doctor clearly view the digestive tract, you should go into the procedure with an empty stomach. Your doctor will review preparation with you. You may need to prepare with:\n- Food and drink: Consume only clear liquids (broth, gelatin, popsicles, water, black coffee or tea) for six to eight hours before the procedure.\n- Medications: Stop taking medicines that thin blood or affect blood clotting, including aspirin. You may need to switch medications for diabetes or high blood pressure. Follow your doctor’s recommendation.\nHow is an upper endoscopy performed?\nAn upper endoscopy is typically an outpatient procedure, meaning you go home the same day. The procedure may be uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. You’ll receive an intravenous sedative or another form of anesthesia. Someone should drive you home after the procedure.\nYou lie on your left side during the procedure, which takes about 30 minutes. Your doctor:\n- Administers a numbing spray to your throat and inserts a mouthguard to protect your teeth.\n- Guides the endoscope through your mouth and down into the esophagus, stomach and duodenum.\n- Pumps air through the endoscope into the stomach and duodenum to make it easier to see organs.\n- Views images from the endoscope on a video monitor while looking for problems or performing treatments.\n- Removes small pieces of tissue to biopsy (examine in a lab), if necessary.\n- Performs treatments, if needed.\nWhat should I expect after an upper endoscopy?\nYou’ll spend some time recovering while the sedative wears off before going home. An upper endoscopy can irritate your throat. You may be hoarse or have a cough for a few days. You can eat soft foods, drink ice water and use throat lozenges until the soreness subsides.\nAfter the procedure, you may experience some bloating (a swollen feeling from the pumped-in air) and nausea (an anesthesia side effect). With your doctor’s approval, you should be able to resume your usual activities, including working and driving, the next day.\nRisks / Benefits\nWhat are the potential risks or complications of upper endoscopy?\nAn upper endoscopy is a relatively low-risk procedure. Potential complications include:\n- Allergic reactions to the sedative.\n- Digestive tract bleeding or infection.\n- Tear (perforation) in the digestive tract lining.\nRecovery and Outlook\nWhen should I get my test results?\nYour doctor may share diagnostic findings with you immediately. It can take up to two weeks to get biopsy results.\nWhen to Call the Doctor\nWhen should I call the doctor?\nYou should call your healthcare provider if you experience:\n- Chronic cough or coughing up or vomiting blood.\n- Difficulty swallowing.\n- Fever and chills.\n- Rectal bleeding (black, tarry stool).\n- Severe throat pain, chest pain or abdominal pain.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nAn upper endoscopy is a relatively low-risk procedure that helps your doctor find the cause of certain digestive tract problems. Your doctor may also use upper endoscopy to treat some problems. You may have a day or two of throat irritation and bloating after the procedure. If your doctor took biopsy samples, it could take a few weeks to get results.\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.

49	high intensity exercise epoc fat loss effects	High-intensity exercise has significant effects on both EPOC and fat loss. Research shows that high-intensity, intermittent training produces greater EPOC (excess post-exercise oxygen consumption) responses than aerobic exercise, leading to higher energy expenditure after exercise as the body restores its systems to normal. This higher EPOC is due to elevated blood lactate and increased circulating hormones. Regarding fat loss, high-intensity intermittent training (HIIT) has been shown to be more efficient for fat loss than low-intensity exercise, even when the total energy cost is lower. For example, one study found that HIIT resulted in nine times greater reduction in skinfolds per energy unit compared to endurance training. This greater fat loss is attributed to significantly higher post-exercise energy expenditure, increased fat utilization during recovery, and greater suppression of appetite.	"['|Resistance Training and EPOC\nJeff M. Reynolds and Len Kravitz, Ph.D.\nAfter cardiovascular exercise or weight training, the body continues to need oxygen at a higher rate than before the exercise began. This sustained oxygen consumption is known as excess postexercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). Originally referred to as an oxygen debt, this postexercise state was first hypothesized by A.V. Hill and H. Lupton in 1922. Hill and Lupton theorized that the body needs to replace the oxygen used by working muscles during mild to intense bouts of exercise. More recently, researchers have used the term EPOC to describe the several different events that occur as the body restores itself to homeostasis, or rest.\nThis article will describe the physiological factors that contribute to EPOC, discuss its relation to weight management and review a recent article on EPOC and resistance training.\nBody:During EPOC the body is restoring itself to its pre-exercise state, and thus is consuming oxygen at an elevated rate. This means that energy is also being expended at an elevated rate. The following occurs during EPOC:\n1) Replenishment of Energy Resources: Replenishment occurs for the immediate source of energy, known as the phosphagen system, which is comprised of creatine phosphate and ATP (adenosine triphosphate). In addition, lactate, a molecule that is produced during more intense exercise, is being converted to pyruvate for fuel utilization. The body is also restoring the muscle glycogen (a stored form of glucose) that has been used during the exercise bout.\n2) Re-oxygenation of Blood and Restoration of Circulatory Hormones: During exercise metabolism, large amounts of oxygen are used to break down food substrates for energy. Therefore, the body continues to expend energy after exercise to re-oxygenate the blood. In addition, in the postexercise period, the body restores the levels of circulatory hormones, which increased during exercise, to normal.\n3) Decrease in Body Temperature: As energy is liberated from the exercising muscle tissues of the body, heat is produced. Thus, during EPOC, the body must expend energy to return to the normal core body temperature.\n4) Return to Normal Ventilation and Heart Rate: Energy expenditure is greatly elevated as the body rapidly returns to a normal breathing rate. Heart rate is also returning to a pre-exercise rate.\nEPOC and Weight Management\nBecause the body continues to expend energy after exercise, EPOC plays a supplemental role to an exercise program in weight management. Currently, researchers are interested in the effect different forms of exercise have on EPOC.\nThe evidence suggests that a high-intensity, intermittent-type of training (interval training) has a more pronounced effect on EPOC (Haltom et al. 1999). Also, it appears that resistance training produces greater EPOC responses than aerobic exercise (Burleson et al. 1998). The research suggests that high-intensity resistance exercise disturbs the bodys homeostasis to a greater degree than aerobic exercise. The result is a larger energy requirement after exercise to restore the bodys systems to normal (Burleson et al. 1998), and thus an explanation for the higher EPOC. The underlying mechanisms that cause the higher EPOC observed in resistance exercise include elevated blood lactate, and an increase in circulating catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) and anabolic hormones.\nInspecting the data from several investigations, it appears that EPOC accounts for postexercise expenditure of 51 (Haltom et al. 1999) to 127 (Burleson et al. 1998) kilocalories. Since a pound of fat is equal to 3,500 kilocalories, the effect of EPOC on weight control must be regarded in terms of a cumulative effect over time.\nCurrent research of resistance weight training and EPOC has noted a relationship between exercise intensity and elevated metabolic rate. As weight lifting intensity increases, the EPOC duration also increases. Most research up to now has been on EPOC and resistance training in males. This recent study attempts to clarify the effects of EPOC on resting metabolic rate (RMR) on healthy, weight-trained females.\nOsterberg, K. L. & Melby, C. L., 2000. Effect of acute resistance exercise on postexercise oxygen consumption and resting metabolic rate in young women. International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, 10 (1), 71-81.\nSeven females, with an average age of 27 years, height of 66 inches, weight of 141.5 pounds and body fat of 18.3 percent, participated in this research study. Subjects were required to maintain body-weight stability, which the authors defined as no gain or loss of weight greater than 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) in the last six months. All subjects meals were standardized prior to and during the exercise intervention.\nThe exercise program consisted of five sets of 10 different exercises. The exercises were performed in agonist/antagonist pairs (push/pull sequence), with 10 to 15 repetitions per set. Opposing muscle groups were paired together to avoid premature failure due to muscular fatigue, and the last two sets of each exercise were performed to failure. The exercise groupings consisted of bench press and bent-over row; leg extension and leg curl; military press and sit-ups; biceps curl and triceps extension; and lunges and lateral raises. The subjects were given a four-minute time period to perform the exercise pairs and could rest for the remainder of the time if they finished before the four minutes expired.\nEPOC remained elevated throughout the three-hour postexercise measurement phase and was measured every 30 minutes. It was 13 percent higher than pre-exercise baseline oxygen consumption (VO2) in the final measurement stage. The subjects average RMR was 4.2 percent higher 16 hours following exercise, when compared to the pre-workout RMR. The authors concluded that intense resistance training produces modest, but prolonged elevation of postexercise metabolic rate in women.\nIntermittent, high-intensity weight training appears to have the greatest effect on EPOC (Melby et al. 1993; Laforgia et al 1997) and individuals who perform high volume (2- Color 5 sets of 10 to 15 reps at 60- 70% of 1-RM) resistance exercise will see minimal weight management benefits from EPOC (Burleson et al. 1997; Osterberg However, it should be emphasized that the overall weight-control benefits of EPOC, for men and women, from participation in resistance exercise occur over a significant time period, since kilocalories are expended at a low rate in the individual postexercise sessions.\nBahr, R. & Sejersted, O.

Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, 10, 75-8.', ""As exercise intensity increases, the proportion of fat utilized as an energy substrate decreases, while the proportion of carbohydrates utilized increases (5). The rate of fatty acid mobilization from adipose tissue also declines with increasing exercise intensity (5). This had led to the common recommendation that low- to moderate-intensity, long duration endurance exercise is the most beneficial for fat loss (15). However, this belief does not take into consideration what happens during the post-exercise recovery period; total daily energy expenditure is more important for fat loss than the predominant fuel utilized during exercise (5). This is supported by research showing no significant difference in body fat loss between high-intensity and low-intensity submaximal, continuous exercise when total energy expenditure per exercise session is equated (2,7,9). Research by Hickson et al (11) further supports the notion that the predominant fuel substrate used during exercise does not play a role in fat loss; rats engaged in a high-intensity sprint training protocol achieved significant reductions in body fat, despite the fact that sprint training relies almost completely on carbohydrates as a fuel source.\nSome research suggests that high-intensity exercise is more beneficial for fat loss than low- and moderate-intensity exercise (3,18,23,24). Pacheco-Sanchez et al (18) found a more pronounced fat loss in rats that exercised at a high intensity as compared to rats that exercised at a low intensity, despite both groups performing an equivalent amount of work. Bryner et al (3) found a significant loss in body fat in a group that exercised at a high intensity of 80-90% of maximum heart rate, while no significant change in body fat was found in the lower intensity group which exercised at 60-70% of maximum heart rate; no significant difference in total work existed between groups. An epidemiological study (24) found that individuals who regularly engaged in high-intensity exercise had lower skinfold thicknesses and waist-to-hip ratios (WHRs) than individuals who participated in exercise of lower intensities. After a covariance analysis was performed to remove the effect of total energy expenditure on skinfolds and WHRs, a significant difference remained between people who performed high-intensity exercise and people who performed lower-intensity exercise.\nTremblay et al (23) performed the most notable study which demonstrates that high-intensity exercise, specifically intermittent, supramaximal exercise, is the most optimal for fat loss. Subjects engaged in either an endurance training (ET) program for 20 weeks or a high-intensity intermittent-training (HIIT) program for 15 weeks. The mean estimated energy cost of the ET protocol was 120.4 MJ, while the mean estimated energy cost of the HIIT protocol was 57.9 MJ. The decrease in six subcutaneous skinfolds tended to be greater in the HIIT group than the ET group, despite the dramatically lower energy cost of training. When expressed on a per MJ basis, the HIIT group's reduction in skinfolds was nine times greater than the ET group.\nA number of explanations exist for the greater amounts of fat loss achieved by HIIT. First, a large body of evidence shows that high-intensity protocols, notably intermittent protocols, result in significantly greater post-exercise energy expenditure and fat utilization than low- or moderate-intensity protocols (1,4,8,14,19,21,25). Other research has found significantly elevated blood free-fatty-acid (FFA) concentrations or increased utilization of fat during recovery from resistance training (which is a form of HIIT) (16,17). Rasmussen et al (20) found higher exercise intensity resulted in greater acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inactivation, which would result in greater FFA oxidation after exercise since ACC is an inhibitor of FFA oxidation. Tremblay et al (23) found HIIT to significantly increase muscle 3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase activity (a marker of the activity of b oxidation) over ET. Finally, a number of studies have found high-intensity exercise to suppress appetite more than lower intensities (6,12,13,22) and reduce saturated fat intake (3).\nOverall, the evidence suggests that HIIT is the most efficient method for achieving fat loss. However, HIIT carries a greater risk of injury and is physically and psychologically demanding (10), making low- and moderate-intensity, continuous exercise the best choice for individuals that are unmotivated or contraindicated for high-intensity exercise.\n1.

50	neurons firing pattern hippocampus versus amygdala lateral nuclei stimulus response comparison	The hippocampus neurons exhibit two distinct firing patterns - slow firing during information acquisition and rapid firing during consolidation, which trigger different responses in the septum. In contrast, the amygdala's lateral nuclei form associations with sensory stimuli during fear conditioning, with distinct neurons responding to positive and negative stimuli without clear anatomical separation.	"['Stanford scientists reveal complexity in the brain\'s wiring diagram\nA Stanford Bio-X team found that the brain\'s wiring is more complex than expected – one set of neural wires can trigger different reactions, depending on how it fires. The work opens new questions for scientists trying to map the brain\'s connections.\nStanford Bio-X researchers raised an entirely new set of questions when they sought answers about connections between two brain regions.\nWhen Joanna Mattis started her doctoral project she expected to map how two regions of the brain connect. Instead, she got a surprise. It turns out the wiring diagram shifts depending on how you flip the switch.\n""There\'s a lot of excitement about being able to make a map of the brain with the idea that if we could figure out how it is all connected we could understand how it works,"" Mattis said. ""It turns out it\'s so much more dynamic than that.""\nMattis is a co-first author on a paper describing the work published August 27 in the Journal of Neuroscience. Julia Brill, then a postdoctoral scholar, was the other co-first author.\nMattis had been a graduate student in the lab of Karl Deisseroth, professor of bioengineering and of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, where she helped work on a new technique called optogenetics. That technique allows neuroscientists to selectively turn parts of the brain on and off to see what happens. She wanted to use optogenetics to understand the wiring of a part of the brain involved in spatial memory – it\'s what makes a mental map of your surroundings as you explore a new city, for example.\nScientists already knew that when an animal explores habitats, two parts of the brain are involved in the initial exploring phase and then in solidifying a map of the environment – the hippocampus and the septum.\nWhen an animal is exploring an environment, the neurons in the hippocampus fire slow signals to the septum, essentially telling the septum that it\'s busy acquiring information. Once the animal is done exploring, those same cells fire off intense signals letting the septum know that it\'s now locking that information into memory. The scientists call this phase consolidation. The septum uses that information to then turn around and regulate other signals going into the hippocampus.\n""I wanted to study the hippocampus because on the one hand so much was already known – there was already this baseline of knowledge to work off of. But then the question of how the hippocampus and septum communicate hadn\'t been accessible before optogenetics,"" Mattis said.\nNeurons in the hippocampus were known to fire in a rhythmic pattern, which is a particular expertise of John Huguenard, a professor of neurology. Mattis obtained an interdisciplinary fellowship through Stanford Bio-X, which allowed her to combine the Deisseroth lab\'s expertise in optogenetics with the rhythmic brain network expertise of Julia Brill from the Huguenard lab.\nMattis and Brill used optogenetics to prompt neurons of the hippocampus to mimic either the slow firing characteristic of information acquisition or the rapid firing characteristic of consolidation. When they mimicked the slow firing they saw a quick reaction by cells in the septum. When they mimicked the fast consolidation firing, they saw a much slower response by completely different cells in the septum.\nSame set of wires – different outcome. That\'s like turning on different lights depending on how hard you flip the switch. ""This illustrates how complex the brain is,"" Mattis said.\nMost scientific papers answer a question: What does this protein do? How does this part of the brain work? By contrast, this paper raised a whole new set of questions, Mattis said. They more or less understand the faster reaction, but what is causing the slower reaction? How widespread is this phenomenon in the brain?\n""The other big picture thing that we opened up but didn\'t answer is: How can you then tie this back to the circuit overall and learning memory?"" Mattis said. ""Those would be exciting things to follow up on for future projects.""\nOther Stanford authors on the paper include postdoctoral scholars Talia Lerner and Thomas Davidson, Bio-X undergraduate fellow Minsuk Hyun and research assistant Charu Ramakrishnan.\nThe work was supported by Stanford Bio-X, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (grants ns034774, ns06477, ns34774, n39579), a Stanford Dean\'s Postdoctoral Fellowship, the Stanford Department of Bioengineering, a Berry Postdoctoral Fellowship, the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Gatsby Foundation.\nAmy Adams, Stanford News Service, 650 796-3695, firstname.lastname@example.org', 'The amygdalae (Latin, also corpus amygdaloideum, singular amygdala, from Greek αμυγδαλή, amygdalē, \'almond\', \'tonsil\', listed in the Gray\'s Anatomy as the nucleus amygdalæ) are almond-shaped groups of neurons located deep within the medial temporal lobes of the brain in complex vertebrates, including humans. Shown in research to perform a primary role in the processing and memory of emotional reactions, the amygdalae are considered part of the limbic system.\nAnatomically, the amygdala and more particularly, its centromedial nucleus, may be considered as a part of the basal ganglia.\nThe cortical nucleus is involved in the sense of smell and pheromone-processing. It receives input from the olfactory bulb and olfactory cortex. The lateral amygdalae, which send impulses to the rest of the basolateral complexes and to the centromedial nuclei, receive input from the sensory systems. The centromedial nuclei are the main outputs for the basolateral complexes, and are involved in emotional arousal in rats and cats.\nIn complex vertebrates, including humans, the amygdalae perform primary roles in the formation and storage of memories associated with emotional events. Research indicates that, during fear conditioning, sensory stimuli reach the basolateral complexes of the amygdalae, particularly the lateral nuclei, where they form associations with memories of the stimuli. The association between stimuli and the aversive events they predict may be mediated by long-term potentiation, a lingering potential for affected synapses to react more readily.\nMemories of emotional experiences imprinted in reactions of synapses in the lateral nuclei elicit fear behavior through connections with the central nucleus of the amygdalae. The central nuclei are involved in the genesis of many fear responses, including freezing (immobility), tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), increased respiration, and stress-hormone release. Damage to the amygdalae impairs both the acquisition and expression of Pavlovian fear conditioning, a form of classical conditioning of emotional responses.\nThe amygdalae are also involved in appetitive (positive) conditioning. It seems that distinct neurons respond to positive and negative stimuli, but there is no clustering of these distinct neurons into clear anatomical nuclei.\nDifferent nuclei within the amygdala have different functions in appetitive conditioning.\nDuring the consolidation period, the memory can be modulated. In particular, it appears that emotional arousal following the learning event influences the strength of the subsequent memory for that event. Greater emotional arousal following a learning event enhances a person\'s retention of that event. Experiments have shown that administration of stress hormones to mice immediately after they learn something enhances their retention when they are tested two days later.\nThe amygdalae, especially the basolateral nuclei, are involved in mediating the effects of emotional arousal on the strength of the memory for the event, as shown by many laboratories including that of James McGaugh. These laboratories have trained animals on a variety of learning tasks and found that drugs injected into the amygdala after training affect the animals\' subsequent retention of the task. These tasks include basic classical conditioning tasks such as inhibitory avoidance, where a rat learns to associate a mild footshock with a particular compartment of an apparatus, and more complex tasks such as spatial or cued water maze, where a rat learns to swim to a platform to escape the water. If a drug that activates the amygdalae is injected into the amygdalae, the animals had better memory for the training in the task. If a drug that inactivates the amygdalae is injected, the animals had impaired memory for the task.\nDespite the importance of the amygdalae in modulating memory consolidation, however, learning can occur without it, though such learning appears to be impaired, as in fear conditioning impairments following amygdalar damage.\nEvidence from work with humans indicates that the amygdala plays a similar role. Amygdala activity at the time of encoding information correlates with retention for that information. However, this correlation depends on the relative ""emotionalness"" of the information. More emotionally-arousing information increases amygdalar activity, and that activity correlates with retention.\nWith advances in neuroimaging technology such as MRI, neuroscientists have made significant findings concerning the amygdala in the human brain. Consensus of data shows the amygdala has a substantial role in mental states, and is related to many psychological disorders. In a 2003 study, subjects with Borderline personality disorder showed significantly greater left amygdala activity than normal control subjects. Some borderline patients even had difficulties classifying neutral faces or saw them as threatening. In 2006, researchers observed hyperactivity in the amygdala when patients were shown threatening faces or confronted with frightening situations. Patients with more severe social phobia showed a correlation with increased response in the amygdala. Similarly, depressed patients showed exaggerated left amygdala activity when interpreting emotions for all faces, and especially for fearful faces. Interestingly, this hyperactivity was normalized when patients went on antidepressants. By contrast, the amygdala has been observed to relate differently in people with Bipolar Disorder. A 2003 study found that adult and adolescent bipolar patients tended to have considerably smaller amygdala volumes and somewhat smaller hippocampal volumes. Many studies have focused on the connections between the amygdala and autism.\nStudies in 2004 and 2006 showed that normal subjects exposed to images of frightened faces or faces of people from another race will show increased activity of the amygdala, even if that exposure is subliminal.\nRecent research suggests that parasites, in particular toxoplasma, form cysts in the brain, often taking up residence in the amygdala. This may provide clues as to how specific parasites manipulate behavior and may contribute to the development of disorders, including paranoia.']"	['<urn:uuid:8ef57bf1-3350-44b8-9998-48c84512ae01>', '<urn:uuid:744f6c77-532c-4ff3-91e7-7caef9705502>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	11	53	1670
51	what are environmental benefits of lng as ship fuel and challenges with emissions reduction in maritime sector	LNG offers significant environmental benefits as a shipping fuel, including lower greenhouse gas emissions due to its high heating value and low carbon content, plus reduced particulate matter and sulfur oxide emissions due to absence of sulfur. However, the maritime sector faces significant emissions challenges. Ships carry 90% of world trade by volume, and combined with aviation, they produce 5% of global carbon dioxide emissions, which could rise to 32% by 2050. A major challenge specific to LNG is methane slip - the emission of unburnt methane into the atmosphere, which is more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. The International Maritime Organization has implemented design efficiency standards projected to save $200 billion in annual fuel costs by 2030, but progress is not at the scale needed to stay within the 2 degrees C global warming limit.	['This week’s London International Shipping Week brings together ship owners, charterers, insurers, commodity traders, port operators, and other key actors in the maritime sector. They play a crucial role in the global economy, given that ships carry around 90 percent of world trade by volume, with the total amount having more than tripled since 1970. Equally critical is the aviation sector, carrying around 35 percent of global trade by value, which includes over half of international tourists and a growing number of business travellers.\nBoth sectors are an increasingly significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. Together they produce 5 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, which could rise to up to 32 percent by 2050. Curbing this emissions growth is critical to staying within the internationally agreed 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) limit to global warming.\nSaving Money and Reducing Emissions\nThe New Climate Economy paper on aviation and maritime examines the double wins of improved efficiency for emissions reductions and economic savings. Current efficiency levels vary greatly: there is a 27 percent difference in the efficiency of the least and most fuel-efficient U.S. airlines, and the most efficient oil tankers are about one-fifth as fuel-intensive as the least. Given that fuel represents around a third of operating costs in aviation and half in shipping, efficiency improvements clearly matter. In shipping, taking full advantage of the measures already available could save over $30 billion annually for the industry and avoid 300 megatons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year by 2030.\nSo why aren’t these obvious economic opportunities being exploited?\nIn shipping, two systemic challenges hinder higher efficiency. The first is the lack of reliable information on the gains available from different efficiency measures. The second is the issue of split incentives between a ship owner and charterer, where charterers bear the fuel costs while the owner is responsible for the improvements, so neither side has a strong reason to change.\nSolutions to address shipping’s split incentives through third-party financing are emerging. These include the Sustainable Shipping Initiative’s Save As You Sail and the Self-Financing Fuel-Saving Mechanism driven by Carbon War Room and University College London. Carbon War Room has also just announced a scheme offering grants of up to $200,000 to cover installation costs for continuous monitoring equipment for ship owners or charterers keen to retrofit with proven technologies.\nEfficiency improvements in aviation, although free of split incentives, have been uneven, with periods of rapid gains in the 1960s and 1980s interspersed with decades of little progress in the 1970s and early 2000s. But now is a good time to take advantage of new technologies that can lead to considerable savings. The latest generation Airbus A320 is around 40 percent less expensive to operate than its predecessor. New engines can provide up to 20% efficiency improvements and “winglets” (wingtip devices that reduce drag) can improve fuel efficiency by 4 percent, paying for themselves in two to three years. Sophisticated air traffic management can also cut journey times and fuel use. What’s needed are stronger incentives to spur progress.\nWhat Can Be Done?\nInternational collaboration is essential for effective action in these two global sectors. While domestic emissions reductions are being driven by countries as part of national climate obligations, international aviation and maritime emissions are not.\nInternational activity in these sectors is governed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), the UN agencies responsible for adopting industry-wide regulations and for ensuring safety, security and good environmental performance. Standards and norms set by these governing bodies can influence the whole industry. And they have taken important steps: ICAO has committed to introducing measures to cap net emissions at 2020 levels and the IMO design efficiency standards are projected to lead to savings of $200 billion on average in annual fuel costs by 2030.\nBut progress is not at the scale needed to maximize the double wins. This is why, in its second major report, Seizing the Global Opportunity, the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate argues for more ambitious action by these agencies. Its recommendations include:\nAction by the IMO to implement a transparent, global system that provides reliable data on operational ship efficiency, and to accelerate the process to establish a policy measure that would promote operational efficiency (such as a global efficiency standard).\nAction by ICAO to implement a stringent aircraft CO2 standard in its 2016 Assembly, including coverage of all new aircraft. Given the sector’s growth trends, ICAO should also incentivise RD&D of sustainable fuels, aiming to make them economically viable in near future.\nBoth sectors have a significant role to play in reducing their emissions to help the world stay on a 2 degree C trajectory – with major economic wins ahead if they do.', 'LNG for the maritime energy transition\nIncreasing the benefits of LNG for shipping by decreasing methane slip in four-stroke engines\nDoes the issue of methane slip affect the climate benefits of LNG as an engine fuel for marine applications? MAN Energy Solutions remains convinced that the switch to LNG marks an important first step towards climate-neutral shipping and has prioritized resolving the issue of methane slip accordingly.\nAddressing methane slip\nWhen used as a shipping fuel, LNG offers various benefits both for shipowners, operators, and the environment. With its high heating value combined with a low carbon content, LNG makes it possible to significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while the absence of sulfur also decreases the particulate matter (PM) and sulfur oxide (SOx) emissions. LNG is therefore considered a viable transitional fuel on the path towards zero-carbon shipping.\nFor many years now, MAN Energy Solutions has been offering a wide range of reliable and robust dual fuel four-stroke engines that are suitable for many different applications and thus cater to the growing demands of the shipping industry.\nBut while this trend is clear, methane slip and its global warming potential are highly relevant topics that also need to be taken into account. The term “methane slip” refers to the emission of small but significant quantities of unburnt methane (CH4) into the atmosphere. This is an issue that needs close observation, as methane is a greenhouse gas that is considerably more potent than carbon dioxide (CO2).\nConcepts for four-stroke engines\nThere are three options for MAN four-stroke dual fuel engines: Direct gas injection, improving the combustion process, and aftertreatment using an oxidation catalyst.\nMAN 51/60DF LNG propulsion system. Since the introduction of the MAN 51/60 dual fuel engine over ten years ago, MAN engineers have already been able to halve methane slip in today’s four-stroke dual fuel engines.\nDirect gas injection\nDirect gas injection is technically feasible: Four-stroke engines can run with high-pressure gas injection according to the Diesel combustion scheme that the proven MAN B&W ME-GI two-stroke engines are already based on today. And the resulting negligible methane slip would be in a similar range, lower than for Otto cycle gas engines. But within the current framework and boundary conditions, it’s not a cost-competitive solution for four-stroke engines. At the moment, it makes more sense to focus on all the things that can be done to improve the Otto cycle technology.\nImproving the combustion process:\nThe Otto cycle on the four-stroke side means that gas and air are mixed before the charge air enters the cylinder. Then this more-or-less homogeneous mixture is compressed in the combustion chamber and ignited with a small pilot flame. This means that premixed combustion takes place, and there are ways to improve this process.\nThe most straightforward approach is to look at the internal engine architecture and reduce the crevice volumes in the combustion chamber – areas where pockets of unburned methane cannot be reached by the flame. The overlap of inlet and exhaust valves, and the timing of gas admission can also be examined. Thus, over the last ten years MAN Energy Solutions has already been able to halve methane slip in our four-stroke gas engines, and we are confident that we can achieve a further 20% reduction by continuously improving the combustion process.Furthermore, Otto cycle gas combustion is characterized by an inevitable trade-off between methane slip and NOx emissions. For engines equipped with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst for NOx reduction, this trade-off can be used to adapt the combustion process for lower methane slip and slightly higher NOx, which can then be easily reduced again by the SCR. This technology has been tried and tested and is available now.\nUsing technical solutions to reduce methane slip can have a real impact on climate change and our environment.\nAftertreatment with an oxidation catalyst – or “oxicat” – is a very promising external measure. MAN Energy Solutions started developing oxicat in 2017, and since then has made considerable progress in the laboratory with a 70% reduction in methane slip.\nThe first pilot installation onboard a vessel will start in 2022. Then, after the full tests, it is expected to become a major technological solution for methane slip reduction, and is scheduled to be widely available around 2024.\nWith a large number of four-stroke dual fuel engines in operation, there is also the possibility of offering retrofits for existing engines, especially for the oxidation catalyst. This is a measure that should be made available for existing engines. In fact, the vessel and engine that will be used for next year’s pilot test have been in operation for some time. This promising case will therefore be a retrofit. Based on this, a similar solution will be possible for other engines as well in the future.\nManaging Methane Slip\nLNG stands for liquefied natural gas, natural gas transformed into a liquid state through a cooling process. In its liquid form, natural gas has a significantly smaller volume for export, shipping, and storage. It is a low-emission, clean-burning fossil fuel that can be used for marine propulsion and transportation and regasified after delivery to a terminal.\n- Produces significantly lower SOx, CO2, NOx and particulate matter emissions compared to fuel oils\n- LNG is considered to be an excellent bridging fuel during the ongoing energy transition\n- Availability of LNG as bunker fuel is increasing quickly\n- Managing methane slip\nWatch the video and find out, what our expert Dr. Gunnar Stiesch, is saying about methane, methane slip and why it is so important to address in the marine business.\nMethane slip on the two-stroke side\nWatch our two-stroke senior specialist Niels Kjemtrup explaining the differences between Otto and Diesel cycle with regards to methane slip.\nIn this session, our expert Niels Kjemtrup is explaining how methane slip can be measured on the two-stroke side.\nThis session explains why it is so important to measure the methane slip in the entire load range\nWatch Niels Kjemtrup’s statement and find out why the MAN B&W ME-GI two-stroke engine is the perfect fit if negligible methane slip is your focus area.\nSolutions / technologies by MAN Energy Solutions:\nLNG Shippingpdf, 4719 KB\nMAN Cryopdf, 2200 KB\nMAN EcoLoad advisory toolpdf, 1929 KB\nReliable GenSet powerpdf, 1743 KB\nFour- stroke marine systemspdf, 11094 KB\nEEDIpdf, 12712 KB\nThe Methanol fuelled MAN B&W LGIM Enginepdf, 1426 KB\nMAN Hybrid EcoAuxpdf, 2090 KB\nMAN B&W ME-GApdf, 1891 KB\nLNGC-optimised designs of ME-GI engines and fuel gas supply systemspdf, 3256 KB\nWhatever your vessel, we have a fuel solution that fitspdf, 1572 KB\nLNG gas supply and bunker systemspdf, 767 KB\nL23/30DF Gensetpdf, 570 KB\nL28/32DF Gensetpdf, 619 KB\nOther future fuels\nReducing shipping emissions\nIMO, Fit for 55, EEXI, CII... reducing emissions and becoming more efficient is a mayor issue for the shipping industry in the near future.

52	When does the brain change the most?	The brain changes most during growth spurts, which are periods of explosive over-production of neural branches. During these windows of opportunity, experiences have the greatest impact on brain wiring, as neurons that fire together connect while unused connections wither and die.	['Each child is walking around with a miracle perched on top of their shoulders. For a long time, the brain was a very difficult thing to study. Now powerful machines allow us to peer into the inner workings of the brain. We have a better sense of how the brain works and how it grows and develops. Need a crash course in brain development 101? This post is for you.\nNeurons: The basic building blocks of the brain\nAn infant arrives in the world with about 100 billion brain cells, or neurons. Each of these has an average of ten thousand branches. This means that the possible number of connections in a new born baby’s brain is one quadrillion! What is even more amazing is that only 17% of these neurons are wired at birth. This means that the rest of these connections take place in the days, weeks, months (and yes, years!) that follow birth.\nGenetics and experience\nTwo forces drive the development of the brain: genetics and experience. I like to think of genetics as the hard wiring and experience the soft wiring. How a baby learns language provides a good example of the combination of hard wiring and soft wiring in action. As new parents know, babies are born into the world perfectly capable of making noise – this is hard wired. However, which of the world’s 6,500 languages a baby will eventually speak is not hard wired. Her language is shaped by her the sounds she hears from her primary caregivers, siblings, and people around her. In other words, by her experience.\nThe neurons that fire together wire together\nA child’s experiences are key to the development of the brain. Neuroscientists have a phrase to emphasize this: the neurons that fire together wire together. I explained this last week to a group of teachers at a conference:\nNot all experiences are created equal\nExperiences with the greatest impact on brain wiring are the ones that happen during a brain’s growth spurts. A growth spurt is exactly what it sounds like. During a growth spurt, a neuron’s branches go into explosive over-production. At this time, experience comes into play. The neural branches that fire together connect while those that don’t fire eventually wither back and die. That means, it’s “survival of the busiest” during growth spurts.\nWindows of opportunity\nScientists call the hyper-growth “blossoming” for obvious reasons, and they call the withering back process “pruning.” But what is doing the pruning? The answer is, experience! Experiences during a growth spurt impact the brain’s wiring more than at any other time in our life. Growth spurts are incredible windows of opportunity and sensitivity when children’s brains hold the most potential for growth and vulnerability.\nWe may not have a lot of control over our children’s genetic wiring, but we sure can shape many of their experiences. We need to give our kids’ brains plenty of opportunities to “practice” the things they need to thrive – from connection to impulse control to exploration to language. This is also why we need to pay attention to the media that they watch, play, and interact with.\nThe entire adventure of parenting and caregiving takes place during a powerful window of opportunity where experience counts. Let’s make the most of it.']	['<urn:uuid:ce056f34-eb08-4d6e-9843-6083a548df05>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	7	41	549
53	leg vein names bottom to top	The venous drainage in the leg flows from the popliteal vein to the superficial femoral vein, which joins with the deep femoral vein to become the common femoral vein. The great saphenous vein then joins the common femoral vein near the inguinal ligament. Above the inguinal ligament, the common femoral vein becomes the external iliac vein, which joins with the internal iliac vein to form the common iliac vein. Finally, the common iliac veins join to become the inferior vena cava (IVC).	"[""Venous access can be obtained through the cannulation of peripheral (e.g., antecubital vein, saphenous vein) or central veins (e.g., internal jugular vein, femoral vein). The insertion of a central venous line is potentially life-saving as, in emergent situations, it allows rapid administration of high-volume isotonic fluids and medications that would otherwise be caustic to peripheral veins. This article will focus on central venous access via the femoral vein. However, there are some aspects applicable to other central venous access sites.\nIn the leg, venous drainage flows proximally from the popliteal vein to the superficial femoral vein. Continuing proximally, the superficial femoral vein is joined by the deep femoral vein in the upper thigh becoming the common femoral vein. The great saphenous vein then joins the common femoral vein near the inguinal ligament. Superior to the inguinal ligament, the common femoral vein becomes the external iliac vein. The internal iliac vein drains into the external iliac vein becoming the common iliac vein, and the common iliac veins join to become the inferior vena cava (IVC).\nThe common femoral vein is the ideal vein to puncture when performing central venous access at the femoral site. The common femoral vein lies within the “femoral triangle” in the inguinal-femoral region. This region is bordered by the inguinal ligament superiorly, the adductor longus medially, and the sartorius muscle laterally. It is important to understand the relationship of structures within the inguinal-femoral region which can be remembered by using the mnemonic “NAVEL.” Moving laterally to medially, (N) femoral nerve, (A) femoral artery, (V) femoral vein, (E) empty space, (L) lymphatics. FOr the remainder of this article the term femoral vein to refer to the common femoral vein unless otherwise specified.\nWhen obtaining the central venous access in the femoral vein, the key anatomical landmarks to identify in the inguinal-femoral region are the inguinal ligament and the femoral artery pulsation. In most instances, central venous access with ultrasound-guidance is considered the standard of care. Nevertheless, the understanding and use of anatomical landmarks are equally important and when used in combination with ultrasound guidance, lead to increased success.\nIn general, the indications for central venous access include the following:\nNote that the indications mentioned above are not absolute. The balance of risks and benefits when performing the procedure should be considered for each patient. The indication for line placement also prompts the proceduralist to consider additional factors.\nIs short-term or long-term access (e.g., peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)) or implantable venous access (Port-a-cath or Broviac catheter) more beneficial to the patient?\nPotential contraindications to central venous access via the femoral vein are the following:\nSince this procedure has life-saving potential, the contraindications noted above are relative. Additionally, if these issues are encountered at the femoral site, an alternative site (e.g., internal jugular vein, subclavian vein) should be considered.\nThe following is standard equipment needed to perform central venous access; although, institutional variability may exist. Additionally, some vendors have pre-assembled kits that may contain a number of these items.\nA sterilized individual to assist with opening packaging and handing sterile equipment in a manner that maintains the sterile field is generally helpful. Additionally, a separate individual to provide sedation/analgesia and monitor effects is ideal and safest for the patient. Lastly, a second, sterilized individual may be required to assist with ultrasonography depending on the comfort and/or experience of the proceduralist.\nEmploy the “landmark technique” to isolate the location of the femoral vein for puncture. There are several methods to do this, and some examples are to:\nAt the desired location and using the slip tip syringe-introducer needle complex, puncture the skin at a 30 to 45-degree angle to the skin.\nComplications from central venous access can be classified into early and late complications. Again, some of these are not specific to the femoral site and can occur with insertion at other central venous access sites.\nThe following are not complications, per se, but can lead to complications:\nCLABSIs are the most common complication of central venous catheter placement. CLABSIs are a source of significant morbidity and mortality, as well as, increased healthcare cost. A majority of the equipment, preparation, and technique described above have been incorporated into bundled practices and checklists that have been shown to reduce the incidence of CLABSIs. In adults, the femoral site is avoided due to evidence demonstrating a higher risk of bloodstream infection relative to other sites. However, this has not been demonstrated in children, and the femoral site is a preferred site in this population due to ease of access. Lastly, long-term central venous access, such as PICCs, have also been associated with a relatively lower risk of bloodstream infections.\nFemoral vein cannulation is usually performed by the physician but the line is monitored by the nurse. In general, femoral vein cannulation is not preferred because the groin site is difficult to keep clean and patient ambulation is difficult. These lines should not be kept for more than 24-48 hours. Nurses should monitor the site for bleeding, infection and hematoma. The only benefit of a femoral line is that unlike a central line, the risk of a pneumothorax is non-existent.\n|||Dinh LD,Nguyen DH, Vascular access for hemodialysis: Current practice in Vietnam.

54	I want to start woodcarving - what are the basic cuts and tools needed?	For basic woodcarving, you'll need several essential tools including Swiss-made pfeil gouges of different sweeps (#2, #7, #8, #9, #11) and sizes. As for the fundamental cuts, there are five main types: the running cut (long strokes across the wood), stabbing cut (pushing straight into the wood), stop cut (controlling grain breakage), sweep/rocking cut (rotating the gouge in a scooping motion), and slicing cut (using flat gouges for surface finishing). These cuts form the basis of woodcarving and are used with different tools to create various effects and patterns.	"[""Master Wood Carver Alexander Grabovetskiy was once awarded the “International Woodcarver of the Year” award by the Woodworker’s Institute. He is now living the dream life of a professional wood carver as he hand carves elaborate furniture and architectural elements for luxury homes and historical buildings around the world. His work is highly sought after because of its life-like appearance.\nBut things were not always so favorable for this award-winning wood carver. In 1973 Alexander was born into a family of craftsmen & artists in the small Soviet town of Dimitrovgrad. His great grandfather, an expert wood Carver, trained Alexander in ornamental wood carving from the age of six years old.\nBy the time Alexander was 16, his work was so advanced that he was taken on as an apprentice under famous wood carver Vladimir Tokarev. Over the years Vladimir taught him the techniques that would culminate in Alexander’s award-winning carving masterpieces later in his life.\nThen his life took a sharp turn when he was arrested by the Soviet government for adherence to his religious conviction, and for his refusal to join the Red Army. Alexander was finally released from prison at the age of 21, at which time he continued to run his successful architectural and ornamental wood carving business that he had started while in prison.\nIn 1996, Alexander, his wife Nadia, and their 10-month old son emigrated from the Soviet Union to the United States, as a political refugee. Now Alexander runs his thriving wood carving business in South Florida, where he lives with Nadia and their three children – Mark, Jessica, and Alexis.\nAlexander often carves day and night, and he works with a number of styles including sculpture, high relief, low relief, architectural and ornamental modes. He is often hired to create intricate classical interior spaces using his trademark hand carved furniture and rococo carvings. Much of Alexander’s inspiration comes from Grinling Gibbons, a 16th century English wood carver who had the uncanny ability to make wood appear like real life objects.\nAlexander makes use of an extreme undercutting technique that creates a unique play between light and shadow, which he feels is the most important aspect of any carving design.\nAs he carves his life-like masterpieces, Alexander only uses hand tools, and he never sands his pieces, believing that the tool marks make each piece distinctive. “It is the same as brush marks on canvas in fine art,” he says.\nAlexander's class is designed to be an introduction to basic carving skills and is perfect for any furniture maker who wants to take his or her carving skills to the next level. Alexander will introduce the student to the design process and ways to embellish their furniture as well as give it character.\nHe will start by sharing his sharpening techniques which he calls “sharpening on steroids.” This is a production style of sharpening that is fast and precise. Demonstrations will also include how to properly use carving gouges. This class will also cover tool selection, how to work with wood grain issues, planning the cut, safe carving techniques, how to clamp the wood without damaging the carving, and subtle tips and tricks in getting the best use out of your gouges.\nStudents will start carving a basic relief of a floral decoration, then move on to a more advanced relief carving of a classical acanthus leaf design, and finally to carving a classic shell design in relief.\nAlexander will explain how to think through a carving project in order to make the carving process the most efficient. He will also demonstrate how to carve the linen-fold design, how to carve grapes or beads, and how to carve lettering. Key Points:\nHow to properly hold gouges for safety & efficiency\nHow to lower down background for relief carving\nHow to work with wood grain issues\nHow to carve a basic floral decoration\nHow to carve a more advanced classical acanthus leaf decoration\nHow to carve a classical scallop shell carving\nTips and tricks on how to get the most out of your gouges\nDemonstrations on linen-fold design, grapes, and letter carving\nA materials fee will be collected at the class. This is typically $25-35 range.\nFundamentals of Carving With Alexander Grabovetskiy Tool List:\npfeil Swiss made - #11 Sweep Veiner, 1 mm, Intermediate Size\npfeil Swiss made - #11 Sweep Veiner, 3 mm, Intermediate Size\npfeil Swiss made - #2 Sweep Gouge 12 mm, Intermediate Size\npfeil Swiss made - #7 Sweep Gouge 14 mm, Intermediate Size\npfeil Swiss made - #9 Sweep Gouge 10 mm, Intermediate Size\npfeil Swiss made - #9 Sweep Gouge 20 mm, Full Size\npfeil Swiss made - #8 Sweep Spoon Gouge 7 mm, Intermediate Size\nAlexander Grabovetskiy 2-26-2021\nLooks like tools may be getting hard to find. Here's an alternative tool set."", ""Jump-start your woodcarving with simple, traditional techniques that beginners can learn to start transforming wood into beautiful works of art. Chris Pye’s Woodcarving Course & Reference Manual (Fox Chapel Publishing, 2012) is a guide to getting started. In the following excerpt, Pye gives instructions for seven cuts that form the basis of the woodworking craft.\nYou can purchase this book from the MOTHER EARTH NEWS store: Chris Pye’s Woodcarving Course & Reference Manual: A Beginner’s Guide to Traditional Techniques.\nIn your hand is a sharp and well-shaped carving tool. You hold it in a safe grip that will let you carve with confidence and facility. Now you want to make things happen — but how exactly? What can you make these tools do? Well, a lot more than most newcomers think!\nHere’s a learning-the-guitar analogy: After you have understood tuning (sharpening) and how to hold the guitar (grips), I imagine our guitar teacher would probably have you plucking strings. You would just play around lightly in a relaxed way, getting a sense of how the guitar works and the notes and chords you could make. So, before turning to woodcarving projects — our tunes proper, so to speak — I want to look at what we can call the outcome of the tool, the sort of notes you can play with a gouge.\nGouge Tools Needed\n• Your gouges and V-tools. Do try what I suggest with different tools.\n• A board of clean carveable wood held safely to the bench. I always like to start with a planed surface. A full cut is just one of the basic carving techniques you can do.\nCuts of the Carver\nVisit the Image Gallery for a photo of each woodcarving cut.\nAs a sample of the versatility of traditional carving tools, I’m going start by separating out a few of the cuts carvers make. Of course, you won’t be thinking in separate cuts like this when you are deep into your carving; you’ll just be working with the tool and eventually forgetting about it.\n1. Running Cut\nHow to do it: This is similar to the low-angle grip. One hand at the rear propels the tool and the other, wrapped around the blade, resists. The blade hand rests on the wood for control as you start, stop, and direct the cut at will, swapping hands to reverse direction. The nature of a running cut is that it keeps going; it’s a long stroke.\nTry running parallel and equal lines of varying depths with your V-tool; then cut curves to the right and left, swapping hands, and so on. Tilt the V to the left and right and observe. Try with a narrow, deep gouge or U tool.\nWith a deep gouge (#8 or #9) run a long channel across the grain. A single deep channel like this is called a flute.\nPlace a second channel as similar as possible to the side, then a third, and so on. The surface will look a bit like it’s been plowed.\nApplication: Running cuts with V- and U-tools have obvious drawing-like applications for veins and hair etc. Lowering the background in this way is a much more efficient approach than simply carving away wood here and there at random.\n2. Stabbing Cut\nHow to do it: Using the high-level grip, put the weight of your shoulder behind the handle. Push the cutting edge of the carving tool straight into the wood and pull it out again.\nTry the cut with a medium gouge: straight in and out. If you wobble the handle from side to side you are likely to break off a corner. To release a stuck blade from the wood, ease it out by tilting the handle in a direction along the edge.\nMake some surface patterns with a gouge.\nTry emphasizing just one corner as you push in. You’ll make a stab cut that starts deep at one end and fades around the curve (sweep) into nothing. You thus have two cuts: to the left and right.\nApplication: Stab cuts are used decoratively, say in the details of hair and fur, and to give emphasis by adding a harder shadow, such as between lips or at the end of a running line. Use your mallet to stab into particularly hard wood.\nWith a change in function, the stab cut can become the very important stop cut.\n3. Stop Cut\nHow to do it: When you place a stab cut so as to control the wood grain — to stop them from breaking out — you have a stop cut. You would make a simple stop cut in exactly the same way as the stabbing cut.\nYou can see the stop cut in action clearly in a medieval decorative element called a thumbnail (or fingernail): Make a strong vertical stab cut with a deep gouge and mallet at one end of the fingernail — this is the stop cut. Scoop up to this with the same gouge. It’s easiest to work across the grain and you may have to cut the thumbnail itself with a few passes. Try making the scoop cut first. You’ll see the bevel of the tool wedges the wood fibers up and forward and finding a precise place to end the cut is difficult. Thus we place the stop cut first to control this wedging effect.\nRepeating these thumbnails side by side will create a simple molding. A challenge would be to make a dozen even and equal ones, side by side.\nApplication: By its very nature, the stop cut has a job to do, and, having done it, the stop cut disappears; it is subsumed by the cuts that follow. This is what separates the stop cut from the stab cut; the stab cut remains on the surface to make its own effect.\nYou can also see stop cuts in traditional incised lettering: a heavy stop cut goes in first in the center of part of a letter, controlling the grain; subsequent angle cuts come in from either side to leave the V trench.\nWe also made stop-type cuts in the last chapter when we finished off the delta-shaped V cuts with a skew chisel. We could have put in the stop cuts first. And a running cut or groove can act as a sort of fire break —functionally a stop cut — to prevent grain splintering.\nWoodcarvers will use stop cuts when necessary and without thinking. Don’t hesitate to apply one to your carving when you need to control the grain.\n4. Sweep or Rocking Cut\n(Note: Remember that the sweep of a gouge is its profile seen end on. In a true gouge, the sweep is a part, an arc, of a circle — unlike U-shaped gouges.)\nHow to do it: The sweep of a gouge is an arc of a circle. Rotate the handle as you push your gouge forward in a short, scooping, running cut. You will be able to feel the edge slicing across the wood as it follows its arc.\nYou can make a sweep cut with either low or high-angle grip, rotating to the left or the right. Make some sweep cuts with a medium gouge (about #6).\nStart and end the sweep cut with the corners clear to avoid tearing the grain. The scooping action of the cut has three parts: the tool enters the wood; you then drop the handle a little and move the edge along as you rotate; you then drop the handle further as you make the exit.\nMore than anything, this is a feely cut and is done with both hands working together: feel the sweep as you scoop.\nTry it with deep gouges too, and rotate the handle both clockwise and counterclockwise.\nRotate the tool along the arc of the sweep but do not wiggle or rock the handle from side to side: this will tear the grain, tend to blunt the cutting edge, and may even result in chipping the metal or losing a corner.\nApplication: The slicing action eases the tool through the wood and produces a much cleaner cut. The movement is also called a rocking cut, sometimes called “rocking the tool through its cut.” Slicing the tool like this along the edge — in this case making full use of the sweep — is, more than any other, the cut of the carver. Indeed I’d say that if you take out running and stop cuts, all my cuts are sliced in some way.\nOne form of the sweep cut is the all-important slicing cut that you make with the flattest gouges.\n5. Slicing Cut\nHow to do it: The arc of the circle that forms the sweep of a very flat (#3) gouge is so big that it’s impossible to rotate the gouge meaningfully at the handle: the corners dig in immediately.\nSo, you have to emphasize the sideways movement as the tool moves forward. Think of paring the surface, drifting the edge across, rather than actually rotating the tool; in fact you are hardly rotating at all.\nWith a #3 gouge in the low-level grip, make very shallow slicing cuts, keeping the corners clear at all times. Work at right angles to the grain — in other words across it — and you’ll find the slice itself will be more or less along the grain.\nSlice from left to right and from right to left. Keep the area clean as you go along. It’s tricky at first not to dig the corners in. If you do, immediately go over the torn grain and repair the surface.\nApplication: This is the cut for flattening and finishing off a surface, from backgrounds to bodies, wherever you choose to finish from the tools rather than sanding. The proviso here is that the closer you can match the sweep to the form, the smoother a surface you will leave; and sometimes, of course, the sweep you need to match the form will not be the flattest.\nThe same slicing action is also used in cutting the curves of incised letters.\nSo there, in brief, are some basic cuts. You’ll need them again and again in projects.\nLearn more: Read Pye's guide to the gouge tool, which can be used to create verstile cuts, even by beginners.\nThis excerpt has been reprinted with permission from Chris Pye’s Woodcarving Course & Reference Manual: A Beginner’s Guide to Traditional Techniques, published by Fox Chapel Publishing, 2012.

55	wood types considerations outdoor sign making weather resistance sandblasting compatibility	For outdoor signs, several wood types offer different characteristics regarding weather resistance and sandblasting compatibility. Cedar and redwood are highly weather-resistant options, with cedar being one of the most weather-resistant species available. Basswood and redwood are specifically recommended for sandblasting, as mentioned in the sandblasting process instructions. When choosing wood for outdoor signs, pressure-treated lumber provides good durability for outdoor exposure, while denser hardwoods like maple and cherry offer greater durability when mounted to structures. The choice of wood should take into account both its ability to withstand weather conditions and its compatibility with the chosen sign-making technique.	"['Making a sign out of old wood can be a great way to give new life to something that may have seen better days. You’ll need an old wooden board or two, a stencil and some paint, and a few other tools.\nFirst, make sure that the wood surface is clean, dust-free and dry before starting. You may consider using a wire brush or sandpaper to smooth the surface and remove any old paint or dirt.\nNext, choose your stencil design, keeping in mind the size and shape of the wood you’re working with. You may need to resize or trace the stencil onto the board.\nSecure the stencil in place with painter’s tape, and then use a foam brush or spray paint to fill in the design. For a more rustic look, you can use a Artist’s brush to paint the letters with a contrasting color.\nOnce the paint is dry and the stencil is removed, you can use wood hardware and sealant to finish your sign. Hanging hardware, such as heavy duty nails or decorative hooks and eyes, can help you display your sign.\nSealant and a clear coat of polyurethane or lacquer will help protect your sign from the elements.\nYour sign is now ready to hang. With a little creativity, you can give new life to old wood and create a beautiful sign for your home or business.\nHow do you make a wooden sign with rustic?\nMaking a wooden sign with a rustic look is a simple process that requires just a few materials and tools. The first step is to select the type of wooden board you will use. A rough cedar board is a good choice as it has a natural rustic feel.\nOnce you have selected the board, cut it to the desired size and sand it down to remove any uneven surfaces and imperfections. After the board is sanded, apply a wood stain or paint to give it the desired color.\nFor a rustic feel, you could apply a dark, aged wood look. Once the board is stained or painted, distress it to add texture and character. To do this, you can use sandpaper, or sand off some of the stain or paint for a distressed, weathered look.\nOnce the desired weathering is achieved, allow the sign to dry completely before applying a coat of sealant to protect it and give it a glossy finish. Lastly, use some wood burning tools to add the desired wording or details to create the rustic wooden sign.\nHow do you make wood look like metal?\nMaking wood look like metal is possible with some simple steps and materials. The simplest way is to paint the wood with a metallic paint. You can use a brush or a spray can to apply the paint. Another option is to use an oxidation process in which you soak the wood in vinegar, then apply a solution of ammonia or sodium hydroxide, followed by a coat of nail polish.\nFor an even more convincing metallic look, you can cover the wood with a metal leafing or foil. Depending on the type of metallic paint or leafing you use, you may need to apply the pieces with an adhesive.\nTo create an aged metal effect, you can apply a combination of paint and paste wax to the wood and rub it with steel wool until it has the desired look. Lastly, you can also give the wood a more textured finish by applying a metallic patina or applying a chemical stain to the wood.\nHow do you patina painted metal?\nPatinas can be achieved on painted metal by using a variety of different chemical processes. One of the most common methods is to create a solution of one part vinegar and two parts salt, applied to the metal and allowed to sit for several hours.\nAfter this, the metal is rinsed off, dried and left to air dry. This will create a unique look that is both rustic and unique. An alternative process is to apply a solution of hydrogen peroxide and warm water.\nThis process will create a blue/green oxidized patina, giving the painted metal a unique and dynamic look. As with the vinegar and salt method, the metal is rinsed off, dried and left to air dry once the desired look is achieved.\nBoth methods produce an aged and rustic patina that can compliment any style of artwork or décor. For best results, use fine steel wool or a Scotchbrite pad to rub away any residue after these processes have been completed, and be sure to apply a clear sealer to protect the metal from further tarnishing.\nCan you distress metal?\nYes, you can distress metal to give it a weathered or antique look. Depending on the desired effect. Sandblasting is one of the most popular methods because it creates a uniform, matte finish. You can also use hammers and other metal working tools to create dents in the metal, or you can use chemical treatments to create a patina.\nGrinding the metal with an angle grinder will also create a distressed look. Finally, you can use drawknives or scraper knives to remove thin layers of metal from its surface.\nHow do you tarnish metal quickly?\nTarnishing metal quickly is possible but is highly dependent on the type of metal being used. Ferrous metals, such as iron and its alloys, are more prone to quick oxidation and tend to tarnish at faster rates.\nThe best way to tarnish metal quickly is to expose it to air and moisture, which encourages the oxidation process. A simple way to achieve this is to mix equal parts white vinegar and table salt and apply the mixture to the metal surface.\nIn some cases, a chemical reaction can be used to speed up the tarnishing process. Ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are both powerful oxidizers, commonly used in industry to create an accelerated oxidation reaction.\nFor example, a solution of 30% ammonia and 5% hydrogen sulfide can be used to quickly tarnish iron and steel. However, as this solution is highly corrosive, safety measures must be taken when using it.\nAnother common method is to use a vibratory or rotary tumbler. A metal is placed inside a tumbler with steel pins, which act to accelerate the oxidation process. It is often used to quickly achieve a surface finish, such as matte or antique, on metal items such as coins, jewelry, and hardware.\nWhether you are looking to achieve a desired finish or corrode metal quickly, there are various methods to choose from. However, it is important to note that it is difficult to undo tarnished metal, so make sure to understand the implications of your choice before attempting any of the methods described.\nWhat is the wood for a sign?\nThe type of wood used for a sign will depend on what type of sign is being created. For outdoor signs, pressure-treated lumber is typically used to ensure the sign will last, while denser hardwoods such as maple and cherry may be used for their greater durability when mounted to a structure.\nSoft woods, such as pine and cedar, may be used for interior signs and applications that do not require the sign to be mounted. Balsa wood and other lightweight materials, such as foam core or even corrugated plastic, are ideal for signs to be suspended from the ceiling or a pole.\nAdditionally, for certain looks and effects, wood veneer and engraving materials may be used for more intricate and decorative signs.\nWhat kind of wood do you use to make a yard sign?\nYard signs can be made from many types of wood, including plywood, pine, cedar, redwood, cypress, and mahogany. The type of wood chosen to make a yard sign depends on your preference and the size of the sign.\nPlywood is popularly used to make larger yard signs because it is lightweight and affordable. Pine is a lightweight wood that is widely available, making it a popular option. Cedar and redwood are more expensive but have a higher level of durability, making them well suited for outdoor use.\nCypress is resistant to decay and adds a natural beauty to the finished product. Finally, mahogany is the most expensive of the options, but is also the most beautiful and durable. Ultimately, it is up to you to decide which type of wood you prefer for your yard sign.\nWhat is the material to use for an outdoor sign?\nWhen it comes to selecting the material for an outdoor sign, there are a variety of factors to consider. Depending on the application and desired lifespan of the sign, there are a few key materials that can be used.\nThe most common material used for outdoor signs are aluminum, PVC, acrylic, and Coroplast.\nAluminum is an excellent material for outdoor signs, as it is lightweight and resistant to corrosion. It is also easy to paint and mount, making it a favorite for many sign applications. However, aluminum signs are not as durable as some of the other materials and can eventually become warped due to environmental conditions such as rain or high temperatures.\nPVC is a rigid, durable material used for outdoor signage that is both cost-effective and more resistant to warping than aluminum. It is also quite light and robust, staying strong in cold weather.\nAcrylic is an extremely resilient material that can withstand harsh outdoor conditions such as moisture, UV light and extreme temperature variations. It is also exceptionally strong, withstanding wind and heavy rain without any damage.\nAcrylic signs look highly professional, making them a popular choice for many business applications.\nCoroplast is another material used for outdoor signage. It is an inexpensive yet lightweight and flexible material, making it an ideal material for signs that need to be moved frequently. Coroplast also stands up well in high humidity and UV light, making it a great choice for long-term outdoor use.\nOverall, it’s important to consider the environment, desired longevity, and cost of the particular sign before selecting the material. Both aluminum, PVC, acrylic and Coroplast are excellent materials for outdoor sign applications, and choosing the right material depends on the purpose and environment of the sign.\nHow thick should wood signs be?\nThe thickness of wood signs typically depends on their size. For smaller signs, the thickness should be at least 3/4 inch, while larger signs may require something thicker, such as 1 to 1 1/2 inches.\nThe type of wood used can affect the overall thickness and material cost. For example, heavier hardwood options, such as oak, may require thicker wood panels to provide sufficient stability, as opposed to softer Woods like Pine.\nThe type of sign it is also plays a factor. If the sign is a supporting or load bearing element, such as a post sign or column, it typically requires thicker and more durable materials. Regardless of the type of wood or size of the sign, it’s important to ensure that the thickness is enough to provide adequate support without compromising the structure or safety while providing a finished product that looks aesthetically pleasing.\nHow do you put words on wood signs?\nPutting words on wood signs involves a few steps. The first step is to prepare the wood for painting or staining by sanding it and cleaning it. Once it is ready, you can use a variety of techniques to apply words to the wood, depending on your preference.\nPaint is a popular option, as it is relatively inexpensive and easy to customize. Depending on your skill level and the desired look, you can stencil on the words, free hand them, or use a brush and carefully fill in the shapes of the letters.\nAnother option is to use a wood burning tool to create precise and beautiful hand-burned words and designs on the wood. You’ll need steady hands and patience, but with practice you can create some stunning pieces.\nIf you want a more contemporary look, you can also use silicone molds and renewable polyester tiles to affix words and designs to the wood. This is a great option for some quick, crisp and precise work.\nNo matter which method you choose, you’ll need to make sure that you seal the wood to protect it from the elements. This will help ensure that the words and designs stay looking great for years to come.\nWhat do you seal wood signs with?\nThe best way to seal wood signs is to apply a sealant that is designed specifically for outdoor use. Many outdoor sealants are designed to protect the wood from fading and weathering, while imparting a subtle sheen.\nSome common sealants used on outdoor wood signs are polyurethane, varnish, tung oil, and spar varnish. Depending on the look you are trying to achieve and the type of wood you are working with, you can select from a variety of sealants.\nIt is important to make sure that the sealant you choose is compatible with the wood type and that it is specifically designed for outdoor use in order to ensure the longevity of your wood sign. Before applying, make sure to take precautionary measures such as wearing a respirator and protective clothing, as some sealants can be hazardous.\nMake sure to also read the instructions on the container carefully prior to application in order to ensure proper usage!.\nWhat wood is most weather resistant?\nCedar is one of the most weather resistant wood species, however there are other options that provide similar levels of protection against the elements as well. Teak, ipe, mahogany, redwood, cypress, and white oak are all incredibly dense and durable types of wood that are highly resistant to the sun, rain, snow, and other forms of precipitation.\nTeak and ipe are perhaps the most well-known for their weather resistance, as they are often used in construction projects, but the others mentioned can be just as functional. When used in a roof or in outdoor furniture, these woods can protect against the elements and last for many years.\nAdditionally, properly sealing and finishing the wood can help to increase its weather resistance.\nDo I need to seal vinyl on wood?\nYes, you do need to seal vinyl on wood. Vinyl is a plastic material, which doesn’t adhere well to most surfaces, like wood. It’s important to seal the vinyl with a high-quality sealant to fill gaps and prevent the vinyl from peeling away from the wood over time.\nFurthermore, sealing the vinyl helps protect it from the elements and increases its durability, making it last longer. Before applying the sealant, you’ll need to ensure that the wood is completely clean from any dirt or debris.\nYou should also lightly sand the surface to create a suction-resistant base. Once the surface is prepped, you can apply the sealant with a brush or a roller. You may need to apply multiple layers, so read the instructions on the product to determine how many layers are necessary.\nAfter the sealant has dried, you can then apply the vinyl.', 'How To Make Sandblasted Signs\nI am going to tell you how you can make a sandblasted sign. The only necessary tools you need are: bass wood, or red wood, rubber masking, spray glue, exacto knife, sand\npaper, paint (which most of these items you can find at your local hardware store). Also you need to know someone in your community who has a sandblasting machine to sandblast your sign. You will also need a design for your board. (It can be your name, or a symbol of what ever you want it to be NIKE, STARTER, etc.)\nNow that you know what you need, you can proceed on your sign. First thing you need to do is to get some bass or red wood. Cut the boards to the exact size you want by using a band saw or hand saw. Also, use the following methods such as gluing, planing, and squaring the boards to the exact length you want your sign to be. Once you have squared your board with the square, your sign will be even on each side. The next step will be to apply the rubber masking to your board.\nNow you are ready to put your design on the rubber masking. Apply the spray glue to the rubber masking. Once you have sprayed the glue (in a well ventilated area) to the masking you should wait for about 2 minutes for the adhesive to dry, and begin to cut out your design you have chosen. This is a very time consuming task so it is best to take your time.\nThis is the time to start cutting on your masking. It is best to leave about one half of an inch around the outside edge of the board. Use your exacto knife to cut the masking. Make sure to center your design and that it is suitably sized to your board. It is important not to make the cuts too small or the sand will tear the rubber masking off.\nYou need to find someone in the community that does sandblasting. This could be at a monument engraving service near by. They use a special sand that is very fine to cut the wood. Sandblasters also use an air compressor to shoot the air and sand out at a high rate of speed. This process will cost between $2-$5 and the time to complete is approximately two days.\nOnce you get the sign back from the sandblasting service, you are ready to start painting the board. At this time you have the option to paint the background. (note: do not take off the rubber masking yet!) For painting the board all you will need is an aerosol spray can of paint that can be a color of your choice. After the paint on the background has dried you need to very carefully pull off the rubber masking that remains on the wood. Next you need to sand down the board with sand paper, preferably 220 grit. This will get off all the extra adhesive that was leftover by the rubber masking. This will leave a refined surface on your board, so you can paint. To complete your project purchase any craft paint of your color preference. It may be necessary to apply many different coats of paint on the sign to make it look the best you can.\nAs you can see it is not difficult to make a sandblasted sign. It takes determination and little will power. Once your project is completed you will have a sign you are proud of. Since you see sandblasted signs everywhere, such as in restaurants and golf courses, perhaps you will choose a career in making signs.

The ceremony can be civil (at a register office) or religious, with documents needed at least 10 days before the wedding. As for farming comparison, vertical farming offers several advantages over traditional farming including year-round crop production, protection from pests, reduced water usage, and the ability to grow in urban areas. However, vertical farming also faces challenges such as high energy requirements, substantial investment costs, and difficulty scaling beyond community-level production. Traditional farming, while able to operate on a larger scale, requires extensive land use and is more vulnerable to environmental conditions.	['Just imagine the scene: the bride makes triumphant walk down the aisle to the wedding march. At the altar, waiting for her, the groom, the witnesses, the conductor and… the interpreter.\nIt could seem out of place, as in the game Which one doesn’t belong, but who did say that the natural habitat for sworn interpreters and translators is only the Court, in good company of lawyers, judges and public prosecutors? Even a church, the register office or any other location intended to celebrate a wedding may be a good alternative, above all if the bride and the groom cannot undeniably understand the language of the celebration.\nThis is one of the many misconceptions on interpreters and translators; focalizing only on the standard occasions and tasks generally managed by the so called sworn or certified translators (trials and lawsuits), we often forget that also a marriage is an event where the presence of an interpreter or translator may be necessary.\nBut what does exactly an interpreter during a wedding ceremony and when and why he/she is absolutely essential? For sure, he/she has nothing to do with the organization, the choice of the wedding gown or the location, the bridesmaids and the uncountable other points bound to this topic. The interpreter is not called to act as a wedding planner (even if the couple to be could ask them, for example, to explain to the photographer the preferred shooting style or ask the cosmetologist for a simpler make-up), but to help the conductor during the different phases of the wedding ceremony.\nHis/her presence is compulsory by law and regulated in Italy by the Decree of the President of the Republic No. 396 of November 3, 2000 when one or both partners are foreign citizens who do not understand the Italian language. The presence of the interpreter is also necessary whether the witnesses do not understand the Italian language. The task of the interpreter and/or of the translator is then to help the future couple understanding the ceremony through all of its phases, in both civil or religious ceremonies.\nThe sworn interpreter and/or translator deals especially with the following tasks:\n1. sworn translation of the documents to be produced to the Italian register office;\n2. interpreting of the statutory declaration, signed by the future couple, before the Superintendent Registrar. This declaration replaces the banns if the partners are not domiciled nor resident in Italy;\n3. interpreting of the wedding ceremony (civil or religious ritual).\nBoth interpreter and translator would be asked to sworn that the task will be faithfully and accurately accomplished.\nTo give you an idea on the interpreter/translator knowledge base, here you are an overview of the different type of marriages that is possible to celebrate in Italy:\nThe foreign citizens can get married in Italy by civil ceremony. This is regulated by sections 84 and following of the Italian Civil Code and it can take place at the register office (or other premises approved by the local authority). It is celebrated by the Major or a duly authorized representative, publicly, in the presence of two witnesses.\nThe conditions to get married are regulated, instead, by the country laws of the future couple and the principal document to be produced is the certificate of no impediment, issued in accordance with section 116 of the Italian Civil Code by the foreign authority. Other documents may also be needed in case of specific agreements or international conventions. The certificate on no impediment must clearly state the following personal details: name, surname, date and place of birth, mother and father, nationality, main residence and condition; it also must report that no legal objection to the marriage exists.\nThe certificate of no impediment can be issued:\n- by the Embassy or Consulate in Italy of the foreign country (the signature must be legalized at the Prefecture for those countries not adhering to Conventions that accept apostille certification);\n- by the competent authority of the foreign country, if its laws authorize it (documents issued abroad must be translated into Italian and legalized by the Italian authority of the same foreign country).\nAs already mentioned, the partners not domiciled nor resident in Italy, instead of giving notice for banns, must sign a statutory form in which they declare no legal objection to marriage exists (relationship, affinity, adoption or affiliation) in accordance with sections 85, 86, 87 no. 1, 2 and 4 and section 88 of the Italian Civil Code. The form can be signed at the registrar office a few days before the marriage, even without witnesses.\nThe necessary files and the copies of the identity documents of partners, witnesses and the interpreter must be produced at the registrar office before 10 days at least of the date of the wedding.\nThe civil effects of marriage are recognized to catholic or other confessions ceremonies, both if an agreement with the Italian country exists or not. In these cases, the Parish or the minister celebrating the ceremony demands a declaration of no impediment to the Superintendant Registrar.\nThe Parish or minister agrees with the partners the day, the hour and the place of the celebration, in accordance with the religious ceremony requirements. Within the next 5 days, he sends the marriage act to the local registrar office to be registered. In the case of partners resident in a different district than the one the ceremony is celebrated, the Superintendant Registrar will send a copy of the marriage act to the corresponding districts of residence.\nThe task of the interpreter will be as always demanding, but studying hard, following regulations and bringing some Kleenex®, just in case, the wedding will end for sure happily!\nWhat about you? Could you list other “unordinary” situations for interpreters or translators?', 'Agricultural systems around the world need to adapt to the rapidly changing environmental, demographic, and socioeconomic landscapes, and new alternative practices, such as vertical agriculture, may offer new opportunities to accelerate such adaptation.\nNext Gen Farming Without Soil and 90% Less Water | GRATEFUL\nWhat is vertical farming and why is it important\nModern agricultural systems encompass an estimated 1.5 billion hectares of the world’s surface area. With a growing population and resource needs, the availability of arable land is shrinking rapidly.\nSince the agricultural revolution, conventional agriculture has focused on practices requiring considerable quantities of space, water, fertilizer, and pesticides. The past 50 years have seen an accelerating rate of increase in these requirements as modern food production aims to increase productivity in the hopes of addressing growing food insecurity.\nLooking into the future, yield production is forecasted to decrease due to widespread environmental and socioeconomic changes that will generate unpredictable consequences on food systems.\nIn response, many strategies have been developed as alternatives to conventional agricultural practices. These strategies have focused on key principles and their combination to be effective: require less space, less water, and increase yield per unit of area. Moreover, due to the negative effects of agrichemicals, modern practices have also aimed to use significantly less to avoid potentially adverse effects for humans and animals.\nOne such alternative is the development of vertical agriculture, also referred to as vertical farming. As the name implies, vertical agriculture relies on expanding production vertically and not horizontally. Vertical agriculture is a multilayer indoor plant production system that allows for precise control of growth factors, such as light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, water, and nutrients.\nThis allows for the growing and production of crops year-round, completely independent of solar light and other external conditions. Indeed, vertical agriculture makes use of key concepts within ecology and physiology to optimize growing and fertilization within controlled conditions. For instance, elements of photobiology, thermomorphogenesis, hydroponics, and genetic breeding, are all used commonly across systems of vertical agriculture.\nBenefits, challenges, and disadvantages moving from horizontal to vertical farming\nAs a result of tight control over crop breeding, growing, and harvesting, vertical farming provides several benefits relative to conventional methods of ‘horizontal’ food production. This was the topic of a literature review by Kalantari et al. published in 2016 in the Journal of Landscape Ecology.\nFrom a systems perspective, the enclosed design prevents pests and diseases from entering by the adoption of a high level of hygiene, continuous monitoring, and non-chemical disinfection, providing security from crops. Moreover, recent technology has also allowed for automated control over environmental conditions by using sensors and imaging techniques in combination with crop simulation models and artificial intelligence, limiting the need for physical labor.\nVertical farming also allows for flexible organization, with designs ranging from large vertical walls covered with crops to large hangars or re-used shipping containers that can be transported. Consequently, vertical agricultural systems, can comprise many varying sizes and be located within many different areas from the middle of highly urbanized cities to more suburban or rural areas.\nMoreover, the verticality element of this system also provides nutrient and water flow, helping to reuse costly resources. The reduction in space also means there is a significant increase in yield per area, holding extensive potential for a future world of urbanization.\nFrom an economic perspective, vertical farming also provides for more jobs in localized areas and is community-focused by addressing the needs of immediate areas, which in turn can provide food at a lower price. Finally, the optionality of location for vertical systems also allows producers to reduce transport costs, as consumers may access them within urban areas, or transport can be minimized to nearby areas.\nHowever, despite the design, environmental, and economic advantages, vertical farming also incorporates several issues that remain a challenge to its broader implementation as a system.\nVertical farming has a high energy requirement and needs extensive investment costs to implement and develop successfully. Moreover, indoor issues relating to excessive UV, heat, and ozone-induced plant damage may have unpredictable repercussions for plant growth.\nAdditionally, vertical systems are difficult to adapt to a larger scale. They are costly to build and maintain and have yet to demonstrate the ability to provide food for larger areas than community-scale populations. This would make it difficult to implement in areas at higher risk of food insecurity, such as developing agricultural nations.\nThe lack of empirical research on a broader scale has meant that vertical farming has yet to develop past the concept stage on community levels, as persistent issues make it difficult to break through to a larger scale.\nImage Credit: YEINISM/Shutterstock.com\nGrowing skywards - the implications of vertical farming in a rapidly populating and changing world\nAmong the development of alternative agricultural practices, vertical agriculture provides a promising solution for many of the challenges facing current agricultural policies. However, for vertical systems to be integrated on a larger scale requires further technological progress and economic investment.\nNevertheless, gradually implementing more verticality, or combining it with other practices aiming for more sustainable practices may be promising. For instance, the combination of verticality with other practices such as intercropping may be particularly beneficial for developing more sustainable food systems.\nIncorporating technological progress into vertical systems also holds promise, with automated sensors and machinery able to operate near-independently. Progress in gene editing and plant genome modifications will also allow for faster, bigger, and healthier crops, allowing vertical agriculture to produce more over time.\nThroughout agricultural history, farming systems have typically spread over large spans of land, yet the reduction in arable land, as well as the increase in demand to house growing populations, means that such strategies need to be reconsidered, and vertical agriculture may play a role looking into the future.\nContinue Reading: Benefits of Vertical Agriculture and Hydroponics\n- Beacham, A.

57	What range of facilities and training resources were made available to visiting military personnel at Fort Leonard Wood for chemical and biological defense instruction?	At Fort Leonard Wood, they utilized multiple facilities including the Marine Corps Detachment's CBRN School house for plotting of CBRN attacks and Joint Warning and Reporting Network training, the Chemical Defense Training Facility for reconnaissance and sampling training, the Edwin R. Bradley Radiological Laboratories, and the Lt. Joseph Terry Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Responder Facility for chemical processes and glasswork. They also had access to the CS gas Confidence Chamber for Individual Protective Equipment Confidence Exercise.	"['Reserve Marines on post for CBRN MOS training\nJuly 31, 2014\nReserve Marines from Kansas spent two weeks on Fort Leonard Wood focusing on their Military Occupation Specialty -- Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear defense.\nThe 30 Marines and one Navy corpsman were here from the CBRN Defense Platoon, 4th Marine Logistics Group, Combat Logistics Regiment 4, Kansas City, Mo.\nThey were here for MOS enhancement training and sustainment training.\n""We have Marines from Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Nebraska and Iowa. They report to Kansas City once a month. With the Reserves, we are dictated to do all of the annual training that active-duty Marines are required to do. But, instead of 365 days, we only have 38 days to get that in. To be able to focus purely on CBRN training is a unique opportunity for us,"" said Chief Warrant Officer 3 Robert Bauer, CBRN Defense Platoon commander, 4th Marine Logistics Group, Combat Logistics Regiment 4, Kansas City, Mo.\nWhile on post, they spent three days at the Marine Corps Detachment\'s CBRN School house, learning plotting of CBRN attacks followed by a Joint Warning and Reporting Network class. They also trained at the Chemical Defense Training Facility, concentrating on reconnaissance and sampling -- once in a self contained breathing apparatus and once in protective mask.\nThey conducted two days of training at the Edwin R. Bradley Radiological Laboratories studying the principles of shielding, detection, identifying radioactive sources, radiological monitoring, radiation detection equipment, radiological site analysis, exploitation and decontamination.\n""The Army and the Marines use the same radiological equipment, and our safety guidelines are the same. In fact, due to the nature of radiation, the U.S. and partner nations use the same tactics, techniques and procedures working around radiological material,"" said Sgt. 1st Class Donald Randall, ERB Radiological Laboratories noncommissioned-officer-in-charge.\nEven though the Marines were the ones here to train, Randall said the rad lab\'s instructors also benefitted from their time with the Reserve unit.\n""Hosting the 4th MLG was a great opportunity for our instructors to teach a class exclusively to Marine personnel. We do train some Marine personnel, but they are either a student in the Chemical Captains\' Career Course or the Chemical Warrant Officer Basic Course.""\nThe 4th MLG Marines also spent two days training with the Technical Escort branch at the Lt.

58	explain why manufacturers do not offer free custom made samples product development	Manufacturers cannot offer free custom-made samples and product development because it would require them to hire an entire team of product developers and go through costly production processes. If they did this, they would need to increase their prices to cover these expenses. This would make them more expensive than their competitors who don't offer free product design services, and buyers would likely take the finished product design to cheaper suppliers who don't have these additional costs built into their pricing.	['Developing a new product is always a challenge, but much more when samples and prototypes are manufactured on the other side of the planet. This is one, of many reasons, why the product development process is a true minefield, riddled with potential disasters, and the top time killer for small businesses, outsourcing production to China, and other Asian countries.\nIn this article, we explain how Chinese manufacturers operate, and how this has a direct impact on how the product development process must be managed. We also explain why you should never rely on your OEM manufacturer to manage the product development procedure for you. Keep reading, and learn how to avoid some of the most common, and disastrous, mistakes made by importers during the most critical phase of the whole importing procedure.\n1: Making a Supplier Selection Without Prior Qualification\nIn a perfect world, suppliers can be divided into two categories: ‘The good’, and ‘The bad’. But in reality, it’s not all that simple. Instead, I see suppliers as divided into three categories: ‘The good’, ‘the bad’ – and suppliers which are ‘good’, yet not technically qualified to take on the project. The latter category is the one I’ll shed some light on here.\nWhat makes a ‘good manufacturer’? They are, at least able to deliver on time, and of course manufacturing according to the buyers technical specifications. That said, a manufacturer can be great at what they do, but just not able to manufacture an item according to your product specification. To a varying degree, manufacturers are always specialized.\nAs such, a manufacturer that is really good at making cheap polyester shirts, may not be a wise choice when what you need is organic Oxford cotton. I keep saying it, but product development always begins with a clearly defined list of technical specifications. Without it, you cannot decide on the factors of which a supplier is to be judged as qualified, or unqualified. Indeed, In compliance with applicable regulations (e.g. FCC and CPSIA) in the target market is another factors of which the supplier selection shall be made – perhaps the most important of them all.\n2: Relying On the Supplier to Fill in the Specification Gaps\nThere are many things that really bugs me in this industry. Being far away from old friends and family for large durations of the year is one thing I put on that list. But if I have to choose one thing that frustrates me the most, then it’s clients expecting us, and the supplier, to magically turn their vague visions into a physical product.\nChinese manufacturers don’t employ psychics – they just can’t read the buyer’s mind. Yet, so many purchasers drop a PDF file with a few images and bullet points, expecting the supplier to somehow ‘sort out of the rest’. In other words, develop the product for them. This is not the way things work. Chinese manufacturers are, as it may sound, manufacturers, not product development agencies.\nIt’s not their responsibility to put in the time and money required to turn your concept into something that can be sent down to the men and women down on the production lines. That responsibility is yours.\nChinese manufacturers are entirely accustomed to manufacturing products according to the buyer’s specifications. So, what is needed to produce an item? Take towels, for example, the following is needed:\n- Design drafts (including dimensions per size, weight, yarns , color, labels, logo areas)\n- Materials (e.g. 100% cotton)\n- Components (e.g. YKK zippers)\n- Graphical file (e.g. washing labels, embroideries)\n- Package (e.g. printed corrugated cardboard box)\nOh, so you didn’t bother to specify that the washing label should be 20 x 42 mm, folded and centered in the end? This happens all too often. No, the supplier is not ‘supposed to understand’, or their practice may be different from yours . It’s entirely up to you, as the importer, to properly specify everything that defines the products design and quality. Leave something out, and you essentially force the supplier to make a qualified guess. Based on my own experience, this is the biggest reason why small to medium sized businesses run into severe quality issues in China.\nSo, is this saying that Chinese suppliers are entirely operating like robots? No, most are more than willing to answer the questions you need answered in order to complete your product specifications. Many are also able to add their “final touch” to your designs (e.g., revise dimensions on a CAD file), but they will never make the design for you. Supplying incomplete, or vague, specifications are the safest way to shoot down any project. Yet, I see this happening on an almost weekly basis, by businesses of all sizes.\n3: Basing a Design on Specifications the Supplier Can’t Reach\nAs important as a comprehensive specification is, it may be worthless if it’s not based on what the supplier can actually comply with. As such, you must be somewhat flexible in terms of design, dimensions, components and materials. Take a fabric for example. What you really wanted was 96% cotton, 4% lycra. However, the supplier is only able to deliver a fabric made of 98% cotton, 2% lycra. Minor difference, one might think.\nThat said, before you send a specification that goes into production, you need to get clear confirmation from the supplier, on whether they are able to comply with all of them. If not, which are the exceptions? What can they offer instead?\n4: Want free custom made samples\nWhat if a Chinese supplier took on extensive product development work from anyone who sent them an inquiry? First, it would force them to hire a whole team of product developers, and go through all the production processes which is all but free. As a result, they would be forced to increase their prices. The buyer, now supplied with a finished product design, starts wondering why this supplier is a dollar or two more expensive than their competition, and takes the design to the next so-called best supplier. The one not burdened by offering free product design services and setup cost. It doesn’t make much sense at all, does it?']	['<urn:uuid:3446faa8-72cd-4c40-a070-354f19331327>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	12	81	1032

60	I'm doing research on the history of pasta terminology and I'm wondering - what did the word 'pasta' originally mean before it referred to the food we know today?	The word 'pasta' originally simply meant dough. This original meaning can still be seen in relatively recent cookery books, where cooks are instructed to make a 'paste' for a pie.	['The origins of pasta are very ancient and much disputed. A couple of things are certain, however. Pasta was NOT brought to Italy from China by Marco Polo, when he returned in from his long, long journey there in 1295. There is also ample evidence that commercial pasta-making was already well and truly established in Italy by this time, but none at all that it was actually invented there.\nWas pasta ‘invented’ in China? That requires a decision on whether ‘noodles’ and ‘pasta’ are the same thing. They are, essentially. The only difference I can think of is that pasta is generally made from wheat (historically, anyway – things such as gluten-free pasta are very modern inventions), whereas Asian noodles may also made from many different ingredients. We tend to think of ‘noodles’ as being Asian – but the word has a German origin, and there are some wonderful contemporary German dishes with noodles. Then again, some early recipes for ‘noodles’ sound more like dumplings, as do early mentions of macaroni, and as for ravioli - some seem to have been more like meatballs. The linguistic confusion continues throughout the history of pasta, and certainly in eighteenth and nineteenth century cookery books, the word ‘macaroni’ appears to be used for any sort of pasta.\nTo unravel the story of pasta requires unravelling the pasta-word itself, which is a seemingly difficult task even for the experts. Pasta originally simply meant dough, and there are echoes of this use in cookery books of very recent times, which instruct one to make a ‘paste’ for a pie, for example.\nAnother thing is sure about pasta. When it did start to become known and used in Britain, it quickly proved adaptable to that great British love – sweet puddings.\nTo make a vermicella pudding.\nYou must take the yolks of two eggs, and mix it up with as much flour as will make it pretty stiff, so as you can roll it out very thin, like a thin wafer; and when it is so dry as you can roll it up together without breaking, roll as close as you can; then with a sharp knife begin at one end, and cut it as thin as you can, have some water boiling, with a little salt in it, put in the paste, and just give it a boil for a minute or two; then throw it into a sieve to drain, then take a pan, lay a layer of vermicelli and a layer of butter, and so on. When it is cool, beat it up well together, and melt the rest of the butter and pour on it; beat it well (a pound of butter is enough, mix half with the paste, the other half melt) grate the crumb of a penny loaf, and mix in; beat up ten eggs, and mix in a small nutmeg grated, a gill of sack [sherry], or some rose-water, a tea-spoonful of salt, beat it all well together, and sweeten it to your taste; grate a little lemon-peel in, and dry two large blades of mace and beat them fine. You may, for a change, add a pound of currants nicely washed and picked clean; butter the pan or dish you bake it in and pour in your mixture. It will take an hour and a half baking, but the oven must not be too hot. If you lay a good thin crust round the bottom of the dish or sides, it will be better.\nThe Art of Cookery, (London,1747) Hannah Glasse\nSimmer an oz. or two of the pipe-sort, in a pint of milk, and a bit of lemon and cinnamon, tender; put it into a dish with milk, two or three eggs, but only one white, sugar, nutmeg, a spoonful of rose-water, and half a glass of wine. Bake with a paste around the edge.\nA layer of orange-marmalade, or raspberry jam, in a macaroni pudding, for a change, is a great improvement.\nThe domestic encyclopedia, or, A dictionary of facts and useful knowledge.(Philadelphia, 1821) A.F.M Willich and T.

61	As an orthodontist, I often get asked about dental traumas - what's the main distinction between handling teeth injuries in patients with and without orthodontic appliances, and what's the initial response protocol in both cases?	For patients both with and without orthodontic appliances, the first response to direct tooth injury is to ice the injured area and contact a regular dentist immediately for X-rays to assess damage. However, for patients with orthodontic appliances, there's an additional step - after seeing the general dentist, they must have their orthodontic appliances checked and adjusted if they were dislodged or displaced during the injury.	"['Occasionally, some patients will experience an injury to the mouth or have something break during treatment. Dental emergencies while wearing braces or other orthodontic devices generally fall into two categories – emergencies related to your orthodontic appliances, and injuries to your mouth, teeth and gums.\nEmergencies Related to Orthodontic Devices\nSometimes, orthodontic devices might be broken or bent during your treatment. If there are any disturbances, such as loose bands, loose brackets, broken or poking wires, or ill-fitting devices please call our office for an appointment during patient hours. For your convenience and the convenience of scheduled patients, it is not possible to handle emergencies on a walk in basis. In the meantime, here are some helpful hints to remedy some of the problems you may encounter until our office can see you as well as some guidelines on what can wait until the next available appointment and what is a true emergency which requires paging the doctor after hours or on weekends.\n- If some part of your orthodontic device is irritating your mouth, cover it with the wax we provided with your braces kit or try to push it out of the way with a blunt soft object like a pencil eraser or Q-tip. Wax can also be purchased at your local drug store – if it is not in the dental section check the ear section for pliable wax or silicon ear plugs.\n- Broken or loose devices or braces that are not causing pain are not an emergency and can generally be left in place until we can get you in to have them repaired or replaced. Please call our office as soon as you are aware that something is not right. If it is after hours or a weekend please leave a message in our general mailbox and we will call you when we are back in the office to answer any questions you might have and schedule an appointment to get you fixed up if need be.\n- If your orthodontic devices are causing pain which is severe enough that you cannot wait until the next business day to be seen, please call us immediately so we can get you in. If it is after hours or the weekend, follow the instruction on our answering machine and the system will forward your call on to either Dr. Osterman, one of our clinical staff, or a doctor who is on call for Dr. Osterman. If you are forwarded to a voicemail box , please don’t forget to leave your phone number on the message! Your call will be returned as soon as possible.\n- Watch this video on YouTube that explains how to handle an orthodontic emergency:\nDirect Injuries to The Mouth & Teeth\nFollowing a direct injury to your mouth or teeth, whether undergoing orthodontic care or not, immediately ice the injured area and you should contact your regular dentist as soon as possible. Usually an x-ray of the involved tooth or teeth is needed to determine the extent of injury. If a tooth has been displaced, knocked out, or fractured, it is best to contact your family dentist first, since we may not have the necessary materials or anesthesia required to treat these injuries. If the appliances are dislodged or displaced, we will need to replace or adjust the appliances as soon as possible, after you have seen your general dentist.\nAfter Office Hours\nIf an orthodontic emergency arises after hours and the patient is in severe pain and cannot wait until the next business day to be seen, please call our main number (925-283-1921). Follow the prompts which ask if you require immediate assistance. You will then be instructed to press a number on your phone which will forward you on to someone who is on call for the office. If you are forwarded on to a voice mail box, please leave your name, the patient’s name and the best contact number and someone from our office or someone who is on call during that time will return your call as soon as possible.', ""Emergency Dental Care for Patients in the\nBronx, Yonkers & Richmond Hill, NY Areas\nAccidents happen and knowing what to do when one occurs can mean the difference between saving and losing a tooth.\nWhen you have a dental emergency — whether it's caused by a sudden accident or chronic disease — your teeth and/or the tissues of the mouth that surround them need to receive proper care right away. At each of our three locations, we make sure that we reserve time in our daily schedules for emergency patients, so you don’t have to worry about waiting for an appointment when you’ve experienced a dental emergency.\nYou’ve Got Nothing to Worry About When You\nTrust Sincere Dental Arts with Your Emergency Dental Care\nTraumatic Dental Injury\nTraumatic dental injuries can occur in people of all ages and activity levels. The cause might be a car accident, a fall down the stairs, or an elbow to the face during a basketball game. As with most types of dental treatment, the primary goal when treating a traumatic dental injury is to save teeth at risk of being lost and restore them to full function and normal appearance. In many cases, the difference between saving and losing a tooth depends on taking the proper action in the immediate aftermath of an injury.\nSevere Tooth Pain\nThe most common cause of dental pain is tooth decay, a bacterial infection that can spread through many parts of the tooth, and even into the gum tissue. Traumatic damage and gum disease can also result in tooth pain.\nThe only sure way to know what's causing tooth pain is to see a dentist, who will ask detailed questions about what you're feeling and perform diagnostic tests, such as x-rays, to try and identify the exact source of the pain. However, there are some general ways to describe the sensations you may be experiencing — and their potential cause.\nWhen dental emergencies and pain occur, our attention is often focused on diseases and injuries related to the teeth. However, it's important to remember that the soft tissues of the mouth — the gums, tongue, lips and cheek lining — may also be affected. While they are tough enough to stand up to the oral environment, these tissues can be damaged by accidental bites, falls, sports injuries, and scalding liquids. They may also suffer injury from foreign bodies that become lodged below the gum line, and they can develop painful and potentially serious abscesses.\nAlthough there can be discomfort associated with orthodontic treatment, there are only a few true orthodontic emergencies. They include trauma or injury to the teeth, face or mouth. Infection or swelling of the gums, mouth or face, and severe, unmanageable discomfort or pain in these areas can also be orthodontic emergencies. In any of these situations, seek immediate care from the dental office or emergency room — whichever is your best option. For loose, broken or irritating pieces of orthodontic hardware, please call the dental office for advice.""]"	['<urn:uuid:3b52f4b2-f4a7-4bb2-9878-11038bfd30f8>', '<urn:uuid:73326e55-3671-407a-8726-a1310f26e9bc>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	35	66	1186
62	how to check filter condition monitoring fluid quality testing methods equipment	There are several methods for monitoring filter and fluid condition. Traditional laboratory-grade analysis should be done on a schedule based on operating conditions. More advanced options include using a 'laboratory in a suitcase' for in-plant testing, or installing Inline Particle Counters (IPC) for real-time monitoring. Inline Viscosity Sensors (IVS) and Inline Water Sensors (IWS) can also be used. Some sophisticated systems measure changes in fluid's dielectric characteristics to detect particle contamination, water, or depleted additives. For filters specifically, differential pressure gauges or switches can be used to compare inlet and outlet pressure, indicating filter element condition. Additionally, clean water flux determinations can be used to monitor membrane performance, involving testing at different pressures to determine the membrane's condition and identify when cleaning or replacement is needed.	['Frequently Asked Questions\nLearn more about filtration and what Membranology has to offer. Find answers to your questions here!\nMembrane filtration involves separation of materials based on their size. The pore size of the membrane is tailored to the specific application.\nCross-flow equipment recirculates the process material across the surface of the membrane, as a result they have a permeate stream and a concentrate stream that can be sampled. These can be operated at a range of temperatures, cross-flow rates and pressures to suit the application, with the ability to sample either stream. The high pressure stirred cell (HPC01) is a batch process whereby a 300mL sample is placed into the assembled cell and pressurised with compressed nitrogen. The stirrer inside the cell mimics the cross-flow action and the concentrate stream is only available post experiment, once the pressure has been carefully vented from the cell.\nMembranes are characterised by the surface material that can be hydrophobic or hydrophilic in nature. The surface tension of hydrophobic membranes repels the water from entering the pores. Water will only enter the pores if the applied pressure is greater than the membrane’s water entry pressure. Hydrophobic membranes can be pre-wetted using alcohol.\nHydrophilic membranes have a low surface tension and water enters the pores as soon as it comes into contact with the membrane (capillary action).\nFlat sheet membranes are stored according to the manufacturer guidance. Some are stored in cold environments, but in general, storage in a cool place away from direct sunlight is recommended.\nYes, flat sheet membranes for water or aqueous solutions require pre-conditioning prior to your experiment. This involves flushing deionised water through the membrane at the pressure and temperature expected for the separation experiments. This ensures that the membrane is compacted at the operational pressure and temperature and removes any residuals or preservatives. A clean water flux determination should be completed on this wetted membrane to determine the performance prior to the separation experiments.\nDo not allow the wetted disc to dry out, store in a suitable medium.\nOnce the membranes have been used they must be kept wet. For short term storage (1 week or less) they can be stored in deionised water. For longer term storage the bacterial growth is controlled by storing in a 0.5% sodium metabisulfite solution, which is replaced at least every 3 months, but better replaced monthly.\nMembranology supply membranes to fit into the stirred cell. There are a large range of membrane options available and a selection pack can be provided for process development purposes. If you have your own membrane then you can cut it to fit into the cell using the support disc as the template.\nClean water flux determinations are used to monitor performance of the membrane. This can be done on cross-flow or using the flat sheets in the HPC01. This involves operating the system at the temperature of the expected separation experiments at a range of different pressures. The specific flux through the membrane is correlated against the transmembrane pressure in order to determine the performance of the membrane. The clean water flux determination should be completed prior to and immediately after the separation experiments. This identifies the level of fouling on the surface and indicates whether a cleaning cycle is required. The clean water flux can be completed post cleaning to determine if the membrane has recovered to the level of that prior to the experiments. Plotting the clean water flux for the membrane over time identifies the performance loss over time and indicates when the membrane must be replaced.', 'Filtration 200: Beyond the Basics\nBy Justin Bitner, Product Sales Manager at Eaton Filtration\nIf working with hydraulics is part of your life, you’ve almost certainly been reading “Filtration 101” articles since day one. You know, the articles that say “Keep the fluid clean” and “Change the filters regularly” and “Put them here or there”—in short, the common-sense things that any hydraulic professional worth his or her salt already knows and does.\nThere is no denying that those things are important. In fact, they’re so important that I’m going to briefly reiterate them here before moving beyond the basics.\n- Filter the fluid before it goes into the reservoir. It doesn’t come from the supplier clean enough to put in your system. Period.\n- Monitor fluid condition regularly. That means laboratory-grade analysis on a schedule determined by your operating conditions, not some arbitrary timetable.\n- Always flush the system to manufacturer specs or ISO standards every time components are replaced or repairs are performed.\n- Monitor the filters and change them before they go into bypass mode. Here again, that requires a schedule based on your operating conditions, not some arbitrary timetable.\n- Make sure the replacement filter elements meet the original manufacturer’s specifications. “Will fit” and “as good as” promises are not acceptable substitutes for verified laboratory testing and qualification.\n- Don’t forget that breathers are filters, too. Unless your system is installed in a clean room, airborne contamination can be a major issue.\n- In almost all cases, filters should not be located at pump inlets. Cavitation is a much greater threat to your pump than contamination—which should not be in your fluid in the first place.\n- Filters should not be placed on the drain lines of piston pumps and motors. Those lines need to be free flowing or you risk the opposite of cavitation, which is equally destructive.\n- The best place for fine filtration is generally on the return side of your system. If you start with clean fluid, any contamination will be generated within the system and caught by a return line filter.\nIf that checklist sounds a lot like your filtration protocol, chances are your hydraulic systems are performing well because you have the basics covered. But in today’s competitive environment, covering the basics is only the beginning. There is a lot more to be considered and implemented if you’re going to maximize the return on your hydraulic investment.\nSo let’s go through that list again and move beyond the basics.\n- If your operating pressures are going up, so should your cleanliness levels. Where 19/17/15 may have been acceptable a few years ago, many of today’s higher-performance systems need 15/13/10 or even better cleanliness levels. Maintaining those levels will probably require more than periodic laboratory analysis of your fluids.\n- One solution is to use a commercially available “laboratory in a suitcase” and do your own testing in-plant. Eaton, and other filter manufacturers, offer highly capable units that will allow you to rest on an accelerated schedule without incurring the costs associated with an outside laboratory.\n- A more advanced solution is to install an Inline Particle Counter (IPC) to provide real-time monitoring. These devices use a variety of technologies to monitor the fluid condition and generate an alarm when anomalies are detected.\n- Inline Viscosity Sensors (IVS) and Inline Water Sensors (IWS) are also available. A comprehensive monitoring solution will include all three types.\n- Even more sophisticated units use a sensor that measures changes in the dielectric characteristics of the fluid. Those changes may be caused by particle contamination, water, or even depleted additives. These systems continuously monitor fluid condition and alert you to any changes in that condition. It’s a different, but very effective, approach.\n- Being proactive during system design can eliminate many common challenges encountered during system operation. For example, mounting any required suction filters outside the reservoir will greatly simplify maintenance. The truth is that suction strainers and filters mounted inside the reservoir are seldom, if ever, serviced.\n- Utilizing manifolds and tank-top filters is another design element that can reduce maintenance challenges. It also eliminates many separate contaminant ingress points, making the whole system more robust.\n- Specifying filters based on maximum published flow rates is another mistake that can be avoided during the design process. Maximum flow rates are exactly that—the maximum the filter can handle without damage to the element. They are most definitely not the flow rates at which the filter can be expected to deliver maximum cost-effective performance.\n- Other factors, such as viscosity changes and cold-start conditions, also impact filter performance and life. As a rule of thumb, sizing the filter for twice the desired maximum flow rate will optimize both filtration performance and cost-effectiveness over the long run.\n- Another good practice is to specify filters equipped with differential pressure gauges or switches. Comparing the inlet pressure to the outlet pressure gives a very good indication of filter element condition. The switch-type units can be hardwired to an annunciator light or another device to notify maintenance personnel of an approaching end-of-life condition before the filter goes into bypass mode.\n- Breathers already have been mentioned, but they are worth a second look. A typical low-cost breather uses a non-replaceable, 10-micron paper element, which means there will be a lot of 10-micron particles allowed into the reservoir.\n- Experience says that if one 10-micron particle goes into the pump, two will come out. Yes, the return line filter will capture them both, but the damage has been done at that point, and the pump’s useful life has been shortened. Spending a few dollars for an effective breather, and then maintaining it like every other filter in the system, will prevent the damage in the first place.\nAs mentioned above, the best location for filters is generally on the return side of the system. In most cases, a finer filter can be installed there than is possible on the supply side because any flow restriction is less likely to impact pumps, motors, and valves.\nFor many systems, an even more cost-effective approach is to take the bulk of the filtration out of the active loop entirely by using off-line filtration in a so-called kidney loop. That is a stationary system that continuously filters the fluid in the reservoir.\nThis approach has several advantages:\n- A kidney loop does not need to operate at high pressure and can, therefore, use less expensive filters.\n- A kidney loop can be shut down for filter maintenance with no impact on system operation.\n- A kidney loop usually can achieve efficient laminar flow to maximize filter performance and deliver dollar/grams of dirt-holding capacity than a filter rated for pressure/return service.\n- A kidney loop can easily incorporate a low-cost, low-pressure cooler to moderate fluid temperature.\n- A kidney loop does not require exceptionally fine filtration since it continuously cleans the fluid. Typical systems use a 25-micron element on the pressure side and a 10-micron element on the return while maintaining specified fluid cleanliness levels.\nDirt destroys more hydraulic systems than any other cause. Effective filtration is your first line of defense. Moving beyond the basics will pay dividends in terms of optimized system performance, minimized operating cost, and eliminated maintenance headaches. It’s definitely worth the effort.\nTagged basics, filtration, maintenance']	['<urn:uuid:7b15029c-8b2d-4780-81ba-4d3efe2fa563>', '<urn:uuid:fa2878b9-b46b-430e-86de-c0016b869a12>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	11	126	1820
63	Can phone cases block both signals and sun damage?	Yes, according to the documents, phone cases can be designed to provide both signal blocking and sun protection through different nanotechnology applications. For signal blocking, cases can be coated with metallic ink containing copper or nickel particles to create a continuous conductive layer that provides electromagnetic shielding. For sun protection, nanoscale materials like titanium dioxide can be incorporated into products to protect from sun damage. Additionally, clear nanoscale films can be applied to surfaces to make them resistant to ultraviolet light while maintaining other protective properties.	"['After more than 20 years of basic nanoscience research and more than fifteen years of focused R&D under the NNI, applications of nanotechnology are delivering in both expected and unexpected ways on nanotechnology’s promise to benefit society.\nNanotechnology is helping to considerably improve, even revolutionize, many technology and industry sectors: information technology, homeland security, medicine, transportation, energy, food safety, and environmental science, and among many others. Described below is a sampling of the rapidly growing list of benefits and applications of nanotechnology.\nEveryday Materials and Processes\nMany benefits of nanotechnology depend on the fact that it is possible to tailor the structures of materials at extremely small scales to achieve specific properties, thus greatly extending the materials science toolkit. Using nanotechnology, materials can effectively be made stronger, lighter, more durable, more reactive, more sieve-like, or better electrical conductors, among many other traits. Many everyday commercial products are currently on the market and in daily use that rely on nanoscale materials and processes:\n- Nanoscale additives to or surface treatments of fabrics can provide lightweight ballistic energy deflection in personal body armor, or can help them resist wrinkling, staining, and bacterial growth.\n- Clear nanoscale films on eyeglasses, computer and camera displays, windows, and other surfaces can make them water- and residue-repellent, antireflective, self-cleaning, resistant to ultraviolet or infrared light, antifog, antimicrobial, scratch-resistant, or electrically conductive.\n- Nanoscale materials are beginning to enable washable, durable “smart fabrics” equipped with flexible nanoscale sensors and electronics with capabilities for health monitoring, solar energy capture, and energy harvesting through movement.\n- Lightweighting of cars, trucks, airplanes, boats, and space craft could lead to significant fuel savings. Nanoscale additives in polymer composite materials are being used in baseball bats, tennis rackets, bicycles, motorcycle helmets, automobile parts, luggage, and power tool housings, making them lightweight, stiff, durable, and resilient. Carbon nanotube sheets are now being produced for use in next-generation air vehicles. For example, the combination of light weight and conductivity makes them ideal for applications such as electromagnetic shielding and thermal management.\n- Nano-bioengineering of enzymes is aiming to enable conversion of cellulose from wood chips, corn stalks, unfertilized perennial grasses, etc., into ethanol for fuel. Cellulosic nanomaterials have demonstrated potential applications in a wide array of industrial sectors, including electronics, construction, packaging, food, energy, health care, automotive, and defense. Cellulosic nanomaterials are projected to be less expensive than many other nanomaterials and, among other characteristics, tout an impressive strength-to-weight ratio.\n- Nano-engineered materials in automotive products include high-power rechargeable battery systems; thermoelectric materials for temperature control; tires with lower rolling resistance; high-efficiency/low-cost sensors and electronics; thin-film smart solar panels; and fuel additives for cleaner exhaust and extended range.\n- Nanostructured ceramic coatings exhibit much greater toughness than conventional wear-resistant coatings for machine parts. Nanotechnology-enabled lubricants and engine oils also significantly reduce wear and tear, which can significantly extend the lifetimes of moving parts in everything from power tools to industrial machinery.\n- Nanoparticles are used increasingly in catalysis to boost chemical reactions. This reduces the quantity of catalytic materials necessary to produce desired results, saving money and reducing pollutants. Two big applications are in petroleum refining and in automotive catalytic converters.\n- Nano-engineered materials make superior household products such as degreasers and stain removers; environmental sensors, air purifiers, and filters; antibacterial cleansers; and specialized paints and sealing products, such a self-cleaning house paints that resist dirt and marks.\n- Nanoscale materials are also being incorporated into a variety of personal care products to improve performance. Nanoscale titanium dioxide and zinc oxide have been used for years in sunscreen to provide protection from the sun while appearing invisible on the skin.\nElectronics and IT Applications\nNanotechnology has greatly contributed to major advances in computing and electronics, leading to faster, smaller, and more portable systems that can manage and store larger and larger amounts of information. These continuously evolving applications include:\n- Transistors, the basic switches that enable all modern computing, have gotten smaller and smaller through nanotechnology. At the turn of the century, a typical transistor was 130 to 250 nanometers in size. In 2014, Intel created a 14 nanometer transistor, then IBM created the first seven nanometer transistor in 2015, and then Lawrence Berkeley National Lab demonstrated a one nanometer transistor in 2016! Smaller, faster, and better transistors may mean that soon your computer’s entire memory may be stored on a single tiny chip.\n- Using magnetic random access memory (MRAM), computers will be able to “boot” almost instantly. MRAM is enabled by nanometer‐scale magnetic tunnel junctions and can quickly and effectively save data during a system shutdown or enable resume‐play features.\n- Ultra-high definition displays and televisions are now being sold that use quantum dots to produce more vibrant colors while being more energy efficient.\nSUNY College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering\'s Michael Liehr, left, and IBM\'s Bala Haranand display a wafer comprised of 7nm chips in a NFX clean room in Albany, New York. (Image courtesy of IBM.)\n- Flexible, bendable, foldable, rollable, and stretchable electronics are reaching into various sectors and are being integrated into a variety of products, including wearables, medical applications, aerospace applications, and the Internet of Things. Flexible electronics have been developed using, for example, semiconductor nanomembranes for applications in smartphone and e-reader displays. Other nanomaterials like graphene and cellulosic nanomaterials are being used for various types of flexible electronics to enable wearable and “tattoo” sensors, photovoltaics that can be sewn onto clothing, and electronic paper that can be rolled up. Making flat, flexible, lightweight, non-brittle, highly efficient electronics opens the door to countless smart products.\n- Other computing and electronic products include Flash memory chips for smart phones and thumb drives; ultra-responsive hearing aids; antimicrobial/antibacterial coatings on keyboards and cell phone casings; conductive inks for printed electronics for RFID/smart cards/smart packaging; and flexible displays for e-book readers.\n- Nanoparticle copper suspensions have been developed as a safer, cheaper, and more reliable alternative to lead-based solder and other hazardous materials commonly used to fuse electronics in the assembly process.\nMedical and Healthcare Applications\nCommercial applications have adapted gold nanoparticles as probes for the detection of targeted sequences of nucleic acids, and gold nanoparticles are also being clinically investigated as potential treatments for cancer and other diseases.\nThis image shows the bamboo-like structure of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes for the treatment of cancer. (Courtesy of Wake Forest and the National Cancer Institute)\n- Better imaging and diagnostic tools enabled by nanotechnology are paving the way for earlier diagnosis, more individualized treatment options, and better therapeutic success rates.\n- Nanotechnology is being studied for both the diagnosis and treatment of atherosclerosis, or the buildup of plaque in arteries. In one technique, researchers created a nanoparticle that mimics the body’s “good” cholesterol, known as HDL (high-density lipoprotein), which helps to shrink plaque.\n- The design and engineering of advanced solid-state nanopore materials could allow for the development of novel gene sequencing technologies that enable single-molecule detection at low cost and high speed with minimal sample preparation and instrumentation.\n- Nanotechnology researchers are working on a number of different therapeutics where a nanoparticle can encapsulate or otherwise help to deliver medication directly to cancer cells and minimize the risk of damage to healthy tissue. This has the potential to change the way doctors treat cancer and dramatically reduce the toxic effects of chemotherapy.\n- Research in the use of nanotechnology for regenerative medicine spans several application areas, including bone and neural tissue engineering. For instance, novel materials can be engineered to mimic the crystal mineral structure of human bone or used as a restorative resin for dental applications. Researchers are looking for ways to grow complex tissues with the goal of one day growing human organs for transplant. Researchers are also studying ways to use graphene nanoribbons to help repair spinal cord injuries; preliminary research shows that neurons grow well on the conductive graphene surface.\n- Nanomedicine researchers are looking at ways that nanotechnology can improve vaccines, including vaccine delivery without the use of needles. Researchers also are working to create a universal vaccine scaffold for the annual flu vaccine that would cover more strains and require fewer resources to develop each year.\n- Nanotechnology is improving the efficiency of fuel production from raw petroleum materials through better catalysis. It is also enabling reduced fuel consumption in vehicles and power plants through higher-efficiency combustion and decreased friction.\n- Nanotechnology is also being applied to oil and gas extraction through, for example, the use of nanotechnology-enabled gas lift valves in offshore operations or the use of nanoparticles to detect microscopic down-well oil pipeline fractures.\n- Researchers are investigating carbon nanotube “scrubbers” and membranes to separate carbon dioxide from power plant exhaust.\nNew solar panel films incorporate nanoparticles to create lightweight, flexible solar cells. (Image courtesy of Nanosys)\n- Researchers are developing wires containing carbon nanotubes that will have much lower resistance than the high-tension wires currently used in the electric grid, thus reducing transmission power loss.\n- Nanotechnology can be incorporated into solar panels to convert sunlight to electricity more efficiently, promising inexpensive solar power in the future. Nanostructured solar cells could be cheaper to manufacture and easier to install, since they can use print-like manufacturing processes and can be made in flexible rolls rather than discrete panels. Newer research suggests that future solar converters might even be “paintable.”\n- Nanotechnology is already being used to develop many new kinds of batteries that are quicker-charging, more efficient, lighter weight, have a higher power density, and hold electrical charge longer.\n- An epoxy containing carbon nanotubes is being used to make windmill blades that are longer, stronger, and lighter-weight than other blades to increase the amount of electricity that windmills can generate.\n- In the area of energy harvesting, researchers are developing thin-film solar electric panels that can be fitted onto computer cases and flexible piezoelectric nanowires woven into clothing to generate usable energy on the go from light, friction, and/or body heat to power mobile electronic devices. Similarly, various nanoscience-based options are being pursued to convert waste heat in computers, automobiles, homes, power plants, etc., to usable electrical power.\n- Energy efficiency and energy saving products are increasing in number and types of application. In addition to those noted above, nanotechnology is enabling more efficient lighting systems; lighter and stronger vehicle chassis materials for the transportation sector; lower energy consumption in advanced electronics; and light-responsive smart coatings for glass.\n- Nanotechnology could help meet the need for affordable, clean drinking water through rapid, low-cost detection and treatment of impurities in water.\n- Engineers have developed a thin film membrane with nanopores for energy-efficient desalination. This molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) membrane filtered two to five times more water than current conventional filters.\n- Nanoparticles are being developed to clean industrial water pollutants in ground water through chemical reactions that render the pollutants harmless. This process would cost less than methods that require pumping the water out of the ground for treatment.\n- Researchers have developed a nanofabric ""paper towel"" woven from tiny wires of potassium manganese oxide that can absorb 20 times its weight in oil for cleanup applications. Researchers have also placed magnetic water-repellent nanoparticles in oil spills and used magnets to mechanically remove the oil from the water.\n- Many airplane cabin and other types of air filters are nanotechnology-based filters that allow “mechanical filtration,” in which the fiber material creates nanoscale pores that trap particles larger than the size of the pores. The filters also may contain charcoal layers that remove odors.\n- Nanotechnology-enabled sensors and solutions are now able to detect and identify chemical or biological agents in the air and soil with much higher sensitivity than ever before. Researchers are investigating particles such as self-assembled monolayers on mesoporous supports (SAMMS™), dendrimers, and carbon nanotubes to determine how to apply their unique chemical and physical properties for various kinds of toxic site remediation. Another sensor has been developed by NASA as a smartphone extension that firefighters can use to monitor air quality around fires.\nFuture Transportation Benefits\n- As discussed above, nano-engineered materials in automotive products include polymer nanocomposites structural parts; high-power rechargeable battery systems; thermoelectric materials for temperature control; lower rolling-resistance tires; high-efficiency/low-cost sensors and electronics; thin-film smart solar panels; and fuel additives and improved catalytic converters for cleaner exhaust and extended range. Nano-engineering of aluminum, steel, asphalt, concrete and other cementitious materials, and their recycled forms offers great promise in terms of improving the performance, resiliency, and longevity of highway and transportation infrastructure components while reducing their life cycle cost. New systems may incorporate innovative capabilities into traditional infrastructure materials, such as self-repairing structures or the ability to generate or transmit energy.\n- Nanoscale sensors and devices may provide cost-effective continuous monitoring of the structural integrity and performance of bridges, tunnels, rails, parking structures, and pavements over time. Nanoscale sensors, communications devices, and other innovations enabled by nanoelectronics can also support an enhanced transportation infrastructure that can communicate with vehicle-based systems to help drivers maintain lane position, avoid collisions, adjust travel routes to avoid congestion, and improve drivers’ interfaces to onboard electronics.\n- “Game changing” benefits from the use of nanotechnology-enabled lightweight, high-strength materials would apply to almost any transportation vehicle. For example, it has been estimated that reducing the weight of a commercial jet aircraft by 20 percent could reduce its fuel consumption by as much as 15 percent. A preliminary analysis performed for NASA has indicated that the development and use of advanced nanomaterials with twice the strength of conventional composites would reduce the gross weight of a launch vehicle by as much as 63 percent. Not only could this save a significant amount of energy needed to launch spacecraft into orbit, but it would also enable the development of single stage to orbit launch vehicles, further reducing launch costs, increasing mission reliability, and opening the door to alternative propulsion concepts.\nMaintaining the Focus on the Benefits of Nanotechnology via EHS and ELSI Efforts\nPlease visit the Environmental, Health, and Safety Issues and the Ethical, Legal, and Societal Issues pages on nano.gov to learn more about how the National Nanotechnology Initiative is committed to responsibly addressing these issues.', '|This article needs additional citations for verification. (March 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)|\nElectromagnetic shielding is the practice of reducing the electromagnetic field in a space by blocking the field with barriers made of conductive or magnetic materials. Shielding is typically applied to enclosures to isolate electrical devices from the \'outside world\', and to cables to isolate wires from the environment through which the cable runs. Electromagnetic shielding that blocks radio frequency electromagnetic radiation is also known as RF shielding.\nThe shielding can reduce the coupling of radio waves, electromagnetic fields and electrostatic fields. A conductive enclosure used to block electrostatic fields is also known as a Faraday cage. The amount of reduction depends very much upon the material used, its thickness, the size of the shielded volume and the frequency of the fields of interest and the size, shape and orientation of apertures in a shield to an incident electromagnetic field.\nTypical materials used for electromagnetic shielding include sheet metal, metal screen, and metal foam. Any holes in the shield or mesh must be significantly smaller than the wavelength of the radiation that is being kept out, or the enclosure will not effectively approximate an unbroken conducting surface.\nAnother commonly used shielding method, especially with electronic goods housed in plastic enclosures, is to coat the inside of the enclosure with a metallic ink or similar material. The ink consists of a carrier material loaded with a suitable metal, typically copper or nickel, in the form of very small particulates. It is sprayed on to the enclosure and, once dry, produces a continuous conductive layer of metal, which can be electrically connected to the chassis ground of the equipment, thus providing effective shielding.\nRF shielding enclosures filter a range of frequencies for specific conditions. Copper is used for radio frequency (RF) shielding because it absorbs radio and magnetic waves. Properly designed and constructed copper RF shielding enclosures satisfy most RF shielding needs, from computer and electrical switching rooms to hospital CAT-scan and MRI facilities.\nOne example is a shielded cable, which has electromagnetic shielding in the form of a wire mesh surrounding an inner core conductor. The shielding impedes the escape of any signal from the core conductor, and also prevents signals from being added to the core conductor. Some cables have two separate coaxial screens, one connected at both ends, the other at one end only, to maximize shielding of both electromagnetic and electrostatic fields.\nThe door of a microwave oven has a screen built into the window. From the perspective of microwaves (with wavelengths of 12 cm) this screen finishes a Faraday cage formed by the oven\'s metal housing. Visible light, with wavelengths ranging between 400 nm and 700 nm, passes easily through the screen holes.\nNATO specifies electromagnetic shielding for computers and keyboards to prevent passive monitoring of keyboard emissions that would allow passwords to be captured; consumer keyboards do not offer this protection primarily because of the prohibitive cost.\nRF shielding is also used to protect medical and laboratory equipment to provide protection against interfering signals, including AM, FM, TV, emergency services, dispatch, pagers, ESMR, cellular, and PCS. It can also be used to protect the equipment at the AM, FM or TV broadcast facilities.\nHow electromagnetic shielding works\nElectromagnetic radiation consists of coupled electric and magnetic fields. The electric field produces forces on the charge carriers (i.e., electrons) within the conductor. As soon as an electric field is applied to the surface of an ideal conductor, it induces a current that causes displacement of charge inside the conductor that cancels the applied field inside, at which point the current stops.\nSimilarly, varying magnetic fields generate eddy currents that act to cancel the applied magnetic field. (The conductor does not respond to static magnetic fields unless the conductor is moving relative to the magnetic field.) The result is that electromagnetic radiation is reflected from the surface of the conductor: internal fields stay inside, and external fields stay outside.\nSeveral factors serve to limit the shielding capability of real RF shields. One is that, due to the electrical resistance of the conductor, the excited field does not completely cancel the incident field. Also, most conductors exhibit a ferromagnetic response to low-frequency magnetic fields, so that such fields are not fully attenuated by the conductor. Any holes in the shield force current to flow around them, so that fields passing through the holes do not excite opposing electromagnetic fields. These effects reduce the field-reflecting capability of the shield.\nIn the case of high-frequency electromagnetic radiation, the above-mentioned adjustments take a non-negligible amount of time, yet any such radiation energy, as far as it is not reflected, is absorbed by the skin (unless it is extremely thin), so in this case there is no electromagnetic field inside either. This is one aspect of a greater phenomenon called the skin effect. A measure of the depth to which radiation can penetrate the shield is the so-called skin depth.\nEquipment sometimes requires isolation from external magnetic fields. For static or slowly varying magnetic fields (below about 100 kHz) the Faraday shielding described above is ineffective. In these cases shields made of high magnetic permeability metal alloys can be used, such as sheets of Permalloy and Mu-Metal (trademark of Magnetic Shield Corporation, Illinois), or with nanocrystalline grain structure ferromagnetic metal coatings. These materials don\'t block the magnetic field, as with electric shielding, but rather draw the field into themselves, providing a path for the magnetic field lines around the shielded volume. The best shape for magnetic shields is thus a closed container surrounding the shielded volume. The effectiveness of this type of shielding depends on the material\'s permeability, which generally drops off at both very low magnetic field strengths and at high field strengths where the material becomes saturated. So to achieve low residual fields, magnetic shields often consist of several enclosures one inside the other, each of which successively reduces the field inside it.\nBecause of the above limitations of passive shielding, an alternative used with static or low-frequency fields is active shielding; using a field created by electromagnets to cancel the ambient field within a volume. Solenoids and Helmholtz coils are types of coils that can be used for this purpose.\nSuppose that we have a spherical shell of a (linear and isotropic) diamagnetic material with permeability , with inner radius and outer radius . We then put this object in a constant magnetic field:\nSince there are no currents in this problem except for possible bound currents on the boundaries of the diamagnetic material, then we can define a magnetic scalar potential that satisfies Laplace\'s equation:\nIn this particular problem there is azimuthal symmetry so we can write down that the solution to Laplace\'s equation in spherical coordinates is:\nAfter matching the boundary conditions\nat the boundaries (where is a unit vector that is normal to the surface pointing from side 1 to side 2), then we find that the magnetic field inside the cavity in the spherical shell is:\nwhere is an attenuation coefficient that depends on the thickness of the diamagnetic material and the magnetic permeability of the material:\nThis coefficient describes the effectiveness of this material in shielding the external magnetic field from the cavity that it surrounds. Notice that this coefficient appropriately goes to 1 (no shielding) in the limit that . In the limit that this coefficient goes to 0 (perfect shielding), then the attenuation coefficient takes on the simpler form:\nwhich shows that the magnetic field decreases like .\nNOTE: In the above relations, is relative permeability µr, which is the ratio of the permeability of a specific medium to the permeability of free space µ0:\nwhere µ0 = 4π × 10−7 N A−2.\n- Electromagnetic interference\n- Electromagnetic radiation and health\n- Ionising radiation protection\n- MRI RF shielding\n- Electric field screening\n- Faraday cage\n- Anechoic chamber\n- Plasma window\n- Seale, Wayne (2007).

64	What are the main hurdles companies face when trying to reduce their overall carbon footprint through supply chain partnerships?	The biggest challenge companies face is addressing Scope 3 emissions, which represent 65-95 percent of most corporate emissions, with only 18 percent of companies reporting on them. This is particularly complicated because it depends heavily on supply chain details and how they're reported. Companies like eBay face additional challenges because they don't own their transportation fleet, making them dependent on deep collaboration with suppliers and vendors to reduce these emissions. Success requires alignment of standards and practices across the private sector, as well as the development of common KPIs and language within organizations.	['The role of business in the health of society and the planet has never been more critical. And as stakeholder calls for companies to use their resources for social and environmental good grow louder, it’s clear that not even multinationals can effect change on their own.\nA July 19 Sustainable Brands™ webinar brought together sustainability and marketing leaders from Meta, eBay, Hotwire Global Communications and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to discuss the imperative for an alliance-based approach to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategies and ways that companies can forge new partnerships to scale impact.\nAn alliance-based approach: Why now?\nIt is a decisive moment in history for the planet and society, and the role business plays in the outcome has never been more critical. Stakeholders are demanding that companies use their resources for social and environmental good; but as the calls for action grow louder, it’s clear that not even multinationals can effect change on their own.\n“As we approach 2030, there is a clear opportunity for increased collaborations across sectors,” said Cecilia Viyella, Global Marketing Lead at Meta.\nMany scientists and policy leaders believe the deadline for limiting warming to 1.5 degrees is fast approaching or has already passed. Throw in intersectional issues of social justice and the problem is even more harrowing, even for governments and multinationals.\n“There’s a lot of work to do even just for the commitments today,” said John Frey, Chief Technologist of Sustainable Transformation at HPE.\nNot to mention the myriad solutions that still need to be implemented to stave off the climate crisis.\nScope 3: The elephant in the room\nScopes 1 and 2 emissions are relatively simple to tackle unilaterally; but taking on Scope 3 emissions is a complicated and daunting task that many companies are just figuring out how to address (scope 3 emissions represent 65-95 percent of most corporate emissions, and only 18 percent of companies report on them).\nThe panelists agreed supply chain and Scope 3 emissions are the biggest challenge to tackle — and successfully addressing them is highly dependent on supply chain minutiae and how they’re reported. And how supply chains are reported is largely dependent on what others in the industry are doing, highlighting the importance of uniting brand ESG strategies.\neBay is particularly interested in engaging pre-competitive partnerships to address its Scope 3 emissions.\n“For Scope 3, there’s so much that has to be done with partnerships, because a lot of [eBay’s] Scope 3 comes from transporting our goods to our customers; but we don’t own any of the actual fleet,” said Alex Muir, Sustainability Manager at eBay.\nThis means deep collaboration with suppliers and vendors to reduce Scope 3 emissions. But Muir recommends making use of existing business partnerships and utilizing internal teams to ascertain what common KPIs and language mean for your organization.\n“You need to be aware of what’s being done externally, but then also use the people you have internally,” Muir said.\nNext steps in cross-sector collaboration\n“Something we are struggling with now in the private sector is an aligning of standards and practices across the board,” Viyella said.\nThere’s no formulaic path to success. In fact, some of the best partnerships break the mold entirely, emblematic of the nuance of an all-hands-on-deck sort of problem requiring an all-hands-on-deck solution.\nInviting stakeholders from outside the industry clique is imperative. For Frey, some of the most effective albeit challenging partnerships arise when NGOs, stakeholders and seemingly disparate groups such as activists rally under one roof to work toward a common goal. He recommends actively seeking out the organizations and individuals most likely to throw stones at the partnership, and invite them in.\nIncluding board members and investors is also needed. Common languages and KPIs have to span to non-staffers including board members and shareholders, who wield power in decision-making but might not be privy to the materiality of pre-competitive partnerships. Frey called for training for boards and investors to help them with partnership goal literacy.\n“This is a topic you can’t go buy a book on or get a college degree in,” Frey said. “You have to learn how to do it and share that knowledge with others.”\nUniversal measurements are key, Viyella said, and should lead to industry-spanning frameworks that help sectors measure advancement and progress.\nWhere to start with measuring success\nThe UN Global Compact (UNGC) — one of the early universal, cross-sectoral ESG agreements — is a classic study of how partnerships can work.\nThe UNGC spawned the development of other collaborations such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In the tech space, Frey saw this cross-sectional collaboration firsthand with supplier audits, which caused a ripple effect in the sector’s common supply chain for employee protection in source factories. This ripple effect eventually created the Responsible Business Alliance, a pre-competitive business partnership foundational in transforming supply chains across the world with common codes of conduct and auditing processes.\nFor those just starting out in pre-competitive industry partnerships, Viyella recommended alignment with the crown jewel of business partnerships: The SDGs. Next, choose a KPI; then build and talk about the progress to find common ground with other competitors and stakeholders.\n“I think we as an industry need to show our advancement with common language and KPIs,” Viyella said.\nFor marketers: Tips on building ESG and sustainability partnerships into your brand strategy\nGreenwashing is a real and present threat. Do the work to ensure accurate, authentic communications; come together; and then talk about it.\nAs a coalition is coming together, consider if the brands in the collective enhance one another or detract from the purpose.\nDon’t hesitate to hire an external agency to help various organizations in your partnership reach consensus on common language, goals, values and co-marketing opportunities.\nLastly, measure and quantify as much as you can along the way.\nBe aligned and grounded in your vision when talking about ESG.\nBe curious about what other companies are doing; and don’t be afraid to gain inspiration and collaborate with the ones you admire.\nLook for a global change with hyperlocal ramifications that everyone can work toward.\nUse tech to leverage data in service of the SDGs and facilitate conversations about how to use data to meet these goals.\nHave marketing communications aligned with ESG goals for consistent messaging.\nAt the end of the day, strive for authentic communication of ESG progress.\nAim for a mutual understanding and collaboration between ESG practitioners and marketing; and make sure what is communicated is fact-based, data-backed, and succinct.']	['<urn:uuid:b0319722-30f9-48d8-aa8c-b75852396c80>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	19	93	1087
65	foreigners buy singapore property restrictions rules	Foreigners can buy most Singapore properties but with restrictions. They cannot purchase HDB flats or Executive Condominiums before 10 years privatization. For landed properties, foreigners need approval from Land Dealings Approval Unit (LDAU) except in Sentosa. However, foreigners can freely purchase private condos, apartments, and commercial properties anywhere in Singapore.	['If you are a foreigner planning to purchase your first property in Singapore. The following frequently asked questions (FAQ) should address your concerns.\nQ – Are there any foreign ownership restriction?\nForeigners are welcome to invest in most Singapore properties from residential, commercial, retail to industrial properties. However, there are some restrictions. Foreigners are not eligible to purchase any landed properties unless they have approval from the Land Dealings Approval Unit (LDAU). LDAU is a department within the Singapore Land Authority (SLA). SLA is a government department that regulates all land matters in Singapore. Alternatively, foreigners are eligible to invest in landed properties in Sentosa. Foreigners are also not eligible to buy any HDB flats (Public housing) or Executive Condominium. The HDB flats and Executive Condominiums are reserved mainly for citizens.\nQ- Can any nationality buy property in Singapore?\nYes. Singapore properties are open to all nationalities to buy for own stay or for investment.\nQ – Is there any minimum sum on the purchase that I make?\nThere is no minimum purchase price for foreigners when buying any property in Singapore.\nQ-Should I buy the property jointly with my spouse or children?\nThere is no restriction to buy it solely or together with your spouse or children. However, only the buyers can secure a mortgage loan. Singapore banking regulation does not allow non-buyers to secure loan.\nIf the buyers plan to buy jointly, they can have the option to buy under “Joint Ownership” so that both of them own the property equally. This is also commonly known as “The right of survivorship”. This clause is used by couples or parents and children buying together. In the event of one passing away, the property automatically goes to the other 100%.\nAnother type is called “Tenancy in Common”. This allows multiple ownership whereby each person has a fixed share of the property. In the event that one party passes away, that person’s share in the property will be distributed according to his/her will. This is frequently used for unrelated parties buying a property together for investment.\nBuyers can also buy under trust for their children if they fall below the legal age which in this case is 21 years old. However, certain condition apply. Please consult a lawyer for more information.\nQ-Can I buy the property under a company name such as a virgin island-based company?\nYes. You can use any incorporated company whether registered locally or overseas to purchase a property in Singapore. However, it is always good to check with locally based solicitors for more complex transactions.\nQ – What are the taxes that I need to pay?\nForeigners purchasing a residential property in Singapore are required to pay taxes on their purchase. The BSD and ABSD are the 2 main taxes. Please refer to the Tax Section of this page.\nQ- Is there tax for property rental income?\nYes. Rental income refers to the full amount of rental income you receive and related payments you make when you rent out your property. This includes rent of the premises, maintenance, furniture and fittings. Rental income is subject to income tax. This means that any profit or net amount left once you have added together your rental income and deducted any allowable expenses is taxable.\nThere are 2 types of tax rates. Net rental income earned by foreigners who are tax residents of Singapore are taxed at resident rates. Net rental income earned by foreigners who are non-residents are taxed at the prevailing non-resident rate of 22%. (www.iras.gov.sg)\nQ- Are there capital gains tax for property?\nYes and No. Generally, the gains derived from the sale of a property in Singapore are not taxable as it is a capital gain. The gains may be taxable if the individual buys and sells property with a profit-seeking motive. When a person is deemed to be trading in properties, the gains from the sale of property in Singapore is considered taxable income. Whether a person is deemed to be carrying on a trade will depend on individual circumstances.\nSome criteria used to assess if you are trading in properties are as follows:\n- Frequency of transactions (buying and selling of properties);\n- Reasons for acquiring and selling of property;\n- Financial means to hold the property for long term; and\n- Holding period\nQ-Do I need to pay capital gain tax when I remit the money back to my home country?\nEvery country has different regulations and it is advisable that you check with your home country on this matter.\nQ- As a foreigners / non-resident could I get a mortgage?\nYes – currently foreigners / non-resident can get a mortgage with most banks in Singapore, subject to credit approval. In any event, if the mortgage is insufficient, you would need to use your own funds to purchase.\nQ- How much can I borrow as a foreigner?\nIf this is your first housing loan in Singapore, the financing is up to 75% of the purchase price or property market value, whichever is lower. Some banks at their own discretion may offer financing up to 60-75% of the purchase price. If you already have an existing residential property loan, the refinancing is up to 100% of your loan outstanding, or 90% of the property market value, whichever is lower. This varies across banks. Please check with your banks for more information.\nQ- What are the documents required for the loan application?\nThe following documents are required for a Home Loan application:\n- Duly completed loan application form\n- Copy of your passport\n- Copy of Identity Card for Malaysia Citizens\n- Latest certified true copy of your income documents:\n- Pay slip or employment letter AND bank statement (latest 3 months) showing salary credit.\n- For self-employed, latest 3 months’ bank statements and latest two years’ notice of tax assessment\n- Copy of property’s option to purchase or copy of Sales & Purchase Agreement.\nQ- Is fire and mortgage insurance necessary?\nYes. fire insurance is required by the Bank to insure your property against the risk of fire. You may at your own discretion purchase mortgage insurance for your mortgage.\nQ- Do I need a bank account to buy property in Singapore?\nYes – You will need a local bank account to pay for the monthly installment and also to collect any form of rental if you plan to rent out the property.\nQ- How do I wire /transfer money to Singapore?\nIf you have an international bank account in your home country, you can always discuss with your private banker to open a local account in Singapore. Your banker will do the rest for you. Alternative, if you wish to save on hefty transfer fees, you can always use third party fund transfer platform found readily online.\nProperty Market & Information\nQ- I want to buy an investment property. Where do I find them?\nIt is always good to invest in a property that is well connected via major transport network or within close proximity to commercial activities. Speak to me to understand more in details.\nQ- How is the property market in Singapore?\nThe property market in Singapore is fairly stable over the years. Singapore is a financial centre in Asia with a stable government. It has attracted many MNCs to set up their regional headquarters. Singapore is a cosmopolitan city. It is also an attractive place to live, work and play. Property prices in Singapore has always been increasing after the last trough in 2015-2016 when prices has fallen after much government intervention to cool the market. Going forward, prices have been increasing so far from the beginning of 2017 till present. This is due to the pent-up demand from buyers and a strong economy.\nQ – How do I search for my ideal property?\nYou can either search for a property by yourself or engage a qualified property agent. It will be tiring and stressful to search for a property in a foreign country. Alternatively, you can engage a qualified property agent who is familiar with the rules and regulations. You can benefit tremendously from their expertise and ground knowledge. Moreover, you do not need to pay them for their services as most of them will be securing their commission from the sellers/developers directly.\nQ- Should I consider buying under-construction or off-plan property?\nBuying an under-construction or “new launch” property which we often called here is pretty safe. Although there is always a certain degree of risk, local laws and regulations are rigid and put in place to ensure that the developers complete the property projects on time and deliver according to the contract. This is unlike other overseas market where extra care has to be taken to purchase property under-construction.\nQ– Can I get a discount from the prices shown?\nNo. Most of the prices stated are generally fixed. There could be times when developers may offer some discounts / rebate off the published prices for certain units. It is always good to check with your real estate agent on this.\nQ- What kind of property should I choose for investment?\nThis depends on your budget, types, location and personal preferences to decide what kind of property to purchase. It is advisable to consult the professional real estate agents for a detailed sharing on the various types of properties available for sale.\nQ- Is there anything better for investment other than residential properties?\nYes. Foreigners are eligible to purchase non-residential properties such as offices, retail shops and industrial spaces. Speak to me for more details as such properties have varying degrees of risk involved.\nQ- Will you help us to lease and manage the property?\nYes. We will continue to manage and secure a tenant on your behalf. Usual commission for securing tenants will apply here.\nQ- What are the on-going expenses of investment properties?\nYou will need to set aside expenses for the monthly maintenance fees to upkeep the property. Such fees vary according to the property. They could range from SG$200 to as much as SG1,000 for bigger property. You will also need to pay yearly property tax imposed by the tax department. In addition, you will need to pay for the usual repair works that are carried out on your investment property.\nQ- Can I buy an investment property and immediately rent it out?\nYes and No. If you are buying a new launch which the property has yet to receive its Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) or yet to collect key. You will need to wait till it obtains TOP before you can rent it out. Alternatively, if you are buying a resale property or a new launch which the property has received its TOP, you can rent it out almost immediately.\nQ- Can I use my property for vacation and rent out the rest of the year?\nYes. Singapore law now allows tenancy with a minimum duration of 3 months, if you plan to rent out your private properties. For the rest of the period, you may occupy it during your vacation. However, do note that the property may be left empty for a while before the next tenant moves in.\nQ- If I want to re-sell my investment property after acquiring it for a few years, can you assist to do it?\nYes. We can help you market your property for sale. However, you should only do it after the 3rd year to avoid the seller stamp duty (SSD).\nQ-What are the rental rates like?\nProperties in Singapore on an average has a rental yield of 2% to 3% or more.\nQ – Do you sell only to overseas buyers?\nNo. Only a small percentage of homes are sold to foreign buyers. As Singapore is an open and cosmopolitan city, we welcome foreign buyers to invest in our properties. Most of the homes that are sold here are still sold mainly to locals, with the exception of luxury homes in the prime areas where the majority of buyers are foreigners.\nQ – Does Singapore have strict laws on money laundering and terrorism financing?\nYes. Singapore is a member of an international task force, called FATF (Financial Action Task Force), which is formed to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. The FATF has published 40 recommendations for countries to adopt in combating money laundering and terrorism financing. Singapore has an obligation to implement these recommendations. The FATF recommendations apply to the real estate and other professional sectors. These include the financial sector as well as other businesses and professions such as the public accountants, casinos, moneylenders, pawnbrokers, company service providers, developers and lawyers.\nQ – Does Singapore have strict rule of law?\nA definite yes! Singapore as a financial hub and a leading economy in Asia has a strict rule of law. You will be assured that buying a property in Singapore is safe and secure. Singapore also has a very strong land registry whereby all property transactions will be recorded.\nQ- Does Singapore give me any automatic visa or residency rights?\nNo. There used to be a policy that if you have invested in a certain amount of money in property and in other business, permanent residency status may be granted. However, this policy has since been abolished.\nQ- Is the buying procedure secure?\nYes. Singapore respects the rule of law. In any property transaction, the contract will be clearly spelt out for you to go through. If you have any doubts, you may consult your solicitors to go through with you. The property transaction will be registered with the Singapore Land Authority and conveyancing lawyers will be on hand to assist in a smooth transaction.\nWhat is the difference between Freehold, 999 years Leasehold and 99 years Leasehold?\nThere are basically 2 main categories of tenure in Singapore.\nFreehold and 999 years leasehold are usually grouped together. Freehold properties are termed as “Estate in Fee Simple” or “Estate in Perpetuity”. They are almost the same meaning. 999 years leasehold means the tenure start from a specific year. Since 999 years are a long time, the market value is approximately the same as any freehold property. Such properties are found across Singapore and mainly in more established towns. This is the best category.\nLeasehold ’99 years’ or ‘107 years’ properties are available in many parts of Singapore. They are usually available in newer towns or near metro stations. These land parcels are traditionally sold by the state and thus their tenure is usually 99 years. Most of the properties fall into this category. The value of such properties is less, especially if they are old with fewer years remaining on the lease. If the lease gets shorter than 60 years, the value can be affected as mortgages can be more difficult to obtain. However, such properties have the option of being redeveloped by private developers and get the lease top up, subject to government approval. Rental yield for such properties tends to be higher compared to a freehold or 999 years properties.\nThere is no restriction for foreigners to purchase properties with either tenure.\nComing Down to Singapore\nQ- How do I get to see you at your offices?\nPlease contact us in advance if you plan to visit Singapore on a property buying tour. We will need to make prior arrangement to visit the various properties. We can also take you to meet solicitors and bankers so as to ensure a seamless transaction.\nQ- How can I view properties?\nWe will show you the different type of properties and locations based on your requirement. Such visit takes approximately 4 to 5 hours and prior arrangement is necessary.\nQ- Can I buy a Singapore property without visiting Singapore?\nYes – you can theoretically view the property with the use of technology and buy from the floor plans. We can always appoint an experienced conveyancing lawyer to liaise with you to address any documentation issues. However, we still recommend that you do visit Singapore, meet us and view the various types of properties before making the decision.\nQ- I am interested. What should I do next?\nPlease give us a call and discuss your requirements with us. Thereafter, you can plan to visit us so that we can take you around to view the suitable properties. We will assist you to open a bank account and liaise with a local solicitor when you are here.', 'Singapore is well known for its low crime rate, political stability, good corporate governance, efficiency in government departments, ease of starting a business, and low barrier to language communication. Another attractive part of Singapore is a stable and strong currency. Therefore, can foreigners buy properties in such a safe country like Singapore?\nSingapore allows foreign investments here as well. So yes, foreigners can buy a house in Singapore but with restrictions. There are generally 2 types of subsidized housing in Singapore, namely HDB and EC (Executive condo which is privatized after 10 years). Foreigners can purchase EC only after 10 years.\nFor HDB, only Singaporeans or SPR can purchase them. If you are married and this is your first house, SPR has to pay ABSD for the first property. Likewise for foreigners, if foreigners married an SC and purchased their first property here, they will be subjected to ABSD. However, because its the first home, matrimonial home, the couples can apply for ABSD remission.\nFor EC, SPR can purchase them after 5years or more. For foreigners, they have to wait for the EC to fully privatized before they are allowed to purchase it. EC will fully privatize after 10 years.\nWhen it comes to private properties, foreigners can own as many properties as they want. There is no limit to the purchases. There are 2 types of private properties, strata, and non-strata. Strata titled properties usually refer to condos, apartments, and cluster housing with condo facilities. Non strata-titled properties will usually be landed properties.\nAs of right now, foreigners can purchase condos on any part of Singapore. As for landed properties without approval, they can purchase them on Sentosa island. Condo comes with communal facilities such as gym, tennis courts, bbq pits, function rooms, and wading pools. If you require such facilities, you can consider a condo. However, if you require such facilities and need a large housing area, you might just want to look at cluster houses. Cluster Houses are landed houses in a condominium, coupled with facilities.\nFor foreigners who insist on purchasing landed properties in the mainland of Singapore, there will be some restrictions. You will need to write to LDAU (land dealings approval unit) with regards to the following type of property:\n- Terrace House\n- Semi-Detached House\n- Bungalow / Detached house\n- Strata house that is not under the Planning act\n- Shophouses (non-commercial use – you can check land use on URA master plan)\n- Vacant land\nApplication is on a case by case basis and usually stands a higher chance if you can prove that you have made a significant contribution to Singapore’s economy.\nKnowing the estimated property prices in Singapore will be essential for planning your financials.\nThere is no restrictions for foreigners to purchase commercial properties in Singapore. Commercial properties will include shops, hotels, offices, shopping malls, etc.\nconclusion – can foreigners buy properties?\nForeigners can purchase properties in Singapore but with restrictions. Depending on the type of properties, there might be ABSD incurred as well. Therefore, it is wise to have your property agent to do some homework for you before committing to any properties in Singapore.']	['<urn:uuid:3a2b8375-26e2-4894-aafa-60ab8715954a>', '<urn:uuid:1c5f25c1-1bc1-44b9-83ff-aab7f43503dc>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	6	50	3268
66	Where can someone adjust the device's sound settings?	There are two ways to adjust the volume. You can use the volume icon keys located at the top of the keyboard, which show a microphone symbol with bars and include buttons for volume up and down. Alternatively, you can adjust the output volume through system preferences by clicking on sound.	['As avid Mac users, many of us are guilty of using headphones because the quality of speakers on Apple devices isn’t always the best. However, sometimes you’ll be stuck in a situation where you’ll need to use the speakers on the device. If you’re not aware of where they are located, we can help point you to the correct location.\nA Macbook Air’s speakers are located either below the keyboard or on the side of the keyboard, depending on the Macbook Air’s edition. The first few editions of the Macbook Air include speakers located below the keys. However, in newer editions, the speakers are located on the left and right sides of the keyboard.\nIf you’re still having trouble locating where the sound is coming from, don’t worry. We’ll break down how you can identify the speakers on your Macbook Air.\nWhere Can I Find The Speakers On My MacBook Air?\nIf you can’t locate the precise location by just looking at your MacBook Air, it’s best to use Apple’s support to help determine what edition of MacBook Air you have. Each year, different models are being developed with updated specs and features.\nOnce you know what year and model your MacBook Air is, you can quickly determine the location of the speakers. For models built before 2020, most MacBook Airs will have speakers located underneath the keyboard. The design likely contributes to why the original MacBook Air is known for having muffled or bad-quality speaker audio.\nOn the other hand, newer MacBook Air models built after 2020 have speakers built-in on the left and right sides of the keyboard. Most of the speakers can’t even be noticed unless highlighted on an image of the device. The only exception to this is the MacBook Pro models.\nThere can be up to six speakers installed for a surround sound effect for the MacBook Air Pro. These are designed to provide up to 80% more bass and provide crystal clear sound. The speakers include two large tweeters and four force-canceling woofers.\nCan I Adjust My MacBook Air Volume?\nIf you’re suffering from low speaker sound, there are two ways you can turn up the volume. First of all, you can use the small volume icon keys located at the top of the keyboard. The symbol will look like a microphone with a few bars, and there are two keys, one that turns the volume down and one that turns the volume up.\nThe other method you can use is to head to the sound settings and turn up your device’s volume. To do this, head to system preferences and click on sound. From here, change the output volume.\nWhich MacBook Air Has the Best Sound Quality?\nThe older models of MacBook Airs tend to have better bass. However, newer MacBook Air models have 25% louder sound.\nThe MacBook Air Pros are also known for having superior sound and bass. So, if you’re looking for better sound quality, you most likely will enjoy the MacBook Air Pro.\nHow Can I Get Better Audio Quality?\nSadly, there is no other way to increase the laptop’s built-in sound quality. Instead, you can alternatively purchase headphones or speakers compatible with your device. The plug-in or Bluetooth speakers will have a better output than the MacBook Air.\nMacBook Air Speakers FAQs\nHow Many Speakers Does a MacBook Air Have?\nA newer Macbook Air has two speakers to help provide a stereo effect. One speaker is located on the left side and one on the right side. This gives the best sound output and prevents the audio from sounding muffled.\nWhere are the Speakers and Microphones on MacBook Air?\nThe speakers for newer MacBook Airs are located on the left and right sides of the keyboard. However, older models have speakers located underneath the keyboard. As for the microphone, both the newer and older models have it located on the left side.\nDoes MacBook Air Have Built-In Speakers?\nYes, MacBook Airs have built-in speakers, which are different from previous models. The newer versions include a 3.5mm audio jack and speakers, which can be used simultaneously. That means you can use the speakers simultaneously while using headphones.\nAre MacBook Air Speakers Good?\nThe speakers on a MacBook Air are good but not as good as other models. The speakers are better on the 16-inch MacBook Pro.\nWe understand that it can be confusing to find where the speakers are located on the MacBook Air. Apple doesn’t always list the location of the speakers. With each new edition, the location of some components can end up changing. That being said, if you are struggling to find where your speakers are, then you can check Apple’s support page.\nApple lists where the speakers are located on their support page, depending on the make and model. However, if you still have the instruction manual or have access to Apple’s online manual, you can check to see where they are located. Hopefully, this helps you understand a bit more about where MacBook Airs are located.']	['<urn:uuid:a152b8f4-7a9b-44cc-9696-dca02f807228>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	8	51	842
67	probiotics storage conditions shelf life stability requirements shelf viable cell count standards different countries	Proper storage conditions are crucial for probiotic stability. Refrigeration is ideal as colder air holds less moisture and inhibits bacterial activation. Even under ideal storage conditions, CFU counts decline about 5% monthly when packed in glass and non-refrigerated. Different countries have varying standards for minimum viable cells: Australia requires 10^6 organisms per gram, Japan mandates 10^7 viable cells per milliliter of fresh dairy product, and South Africa requires 10^8 bacterial cells per day. To meet label claims, manufacturers typically add 50-200% overage to account for natural decline. Exposure to moisture, heat, and oxygen decreases stability and causes probiotic bacteria to die. Even refrigerated products have short lives due to negative effects of low temperature and crystal formation on bacterial cells.

The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), National Institutes of Health.\n2 Hirose Y, Murosaki S, Yamamoto Y, Yoshikai Y, Tsuru T. Daily intake of heat-killed Lactobacillus plantarum L-137 augments acquired immunity in healthy adults. J Nutr. 2006 Dec;136(12):3069-73. PubMed PMID: 17116721.\n“Probiotics are live microorganisms (e.g., bacteria) that are either the same as or similar to microorganisms found naturally in the human body and may be beneficial to health. Also referred to as ""good bacteria"" or ""helpful bacteria,"" probiotics are available to consumers in oral products such as dietary supplements and yogurts, as well as other products such as suppositories and creams. The body, especially the lower gastrointestinal tract (the gut), contains a complex and diverse community of bacteria. (In the body of a healthy adult, cells of microorganisms are estimated to outnumber human cells by a factor of ten to one.) Although we tend to think of bacteria as harmful ""germs,"" many bacteria actually help the body function properly. Most probiotics are bacteria similar to the beneficial bacteria found naturally in the human gut.”1\nProbiotics are measured in colony forming units (CFU). CFUs are generally measured in the millions or billions per serving. Probiotics are most commonly beneficial bacteria, but can also be friendly fungal or other organisms, that are typically freeze dried to stabilize them in an inert state during storage and production. Then their continued stability and viability, as measured by CFU counts when cultured, is dependent on limiting their exposure to stimulating environmental conditions such as warmth and moisture. Besides refrigeration, this protection can be done by packaging in glass, as well as by adding freshness packets that help to absorb and reduce moisture in the package.\nTemperature plays a role in the stability of probiotics. Colder air holds less moisture and is not in the ideal temperature range for the bacteria to commonly grow and thrive, thus inhibiting reactivation of the dormant organisms by depriving them of the warmth and moisture that represent their ideal growing conditions. High heat can also degrade the viability of these organisms.\nEven under ideal storage conditions, the number of colony forming units will slowly decline as months go on. For example, a typical number is a drop of 5% per month when packed in glass and non-refrigerated. Refrigeration will prolong the potency and viability of most probiotics to maintain higher counts over a longer period of time.\nIn order to meet label claims for probiotic CFU numbers, manufacturers including NOW Foods generally add an overage to allow for the natural decline in numbers over time. We test to assure that the product meets specifications and label claims in terms of potency (CFUs) at the time of manufacture. Stability studies utilizing the strains, potencies, and designated packaging for a specific product are also done as needed to generate data to calculate an experimental stability curve that predicts changing CFU counts throughout the shelf life of the product. However, the actual rate of change depends on the environment that the product is exposed to, especially if not kept refrigerated.\nThe rate of decline in viable CFU numbers can increase if a probiotic product is held in conditions that are very warm or moist, especially after opening when moisture can more easily get into the package. Because of the extreme variability of the seasonal weather and environmental conditions that a product may experience, and duration of these exposures, it’s not possible to precisely predict potency and shelf life accurately for every person’s situation across a wide geographical area. In some cases, it could happen that adverse conditions may lower probiotic counts below label claim.\nRefrigeration is ideal for storing probiotics. But if that is not possible, it is best to keep the package in a cool, dry place to maintain good stability. Unfortunately, many people tend to keep their supplements in the kitchen or bathroom, which are notorious for being warm and moist and known to shorten the shelf life of many kinds of supplements. Those conditions are ideal for bacterial and mold growth; which means that the probiotics will first tend to activate but then die off more quickly than expected since they are not yet in the human body where they have a chance to live, grow, and thrive. In these adverse conditions, probiotics may lose potency more rapidly than anticipated and thus may not meet label claims for CFU counts that are calculated based on a cool, dry place. On the other hand, refrigerating probiotic products will enhance viability and shelf life.\nIn testing designed to mimic exposures during transportation in a hot climate, a sealed probiotic formula exposed to a temperature of over 122° F for 24 hours still met label claim for CFU content. This indicates that this level of heat over that time period was not enough to kill many of the organisms in the package, so it would take even harsher conditions to rapidly degrade the potency of this specific probiotic product.\nThere is some evidence that even non-viable probiotic organisms left in the package after being exposed to unfavorable conditions may have some utility in gut health. For example, it is hypothesized that they may take up ecological space on the intestinal walls, which may help prevent the growth of opportunistic organisms vying for that same space. For example, inactivated Lactobacillus planetarium has been shown in clinical studies to support our natural immunity to foreign substances (i.e., so-called acquired immunity).2\nThe stability of a probiotic formula tested at the time of manufacture will depend on a combination of factors. Variations in packaging, temperature, and humidity will affect the viability of probiotic products before they are taken. Protective factors that help to preserve the freshness and viability of the probiotic strains in a supplement include refrigeration, resistant packaging, and storage in a cool, dry place.', 'Issues with current probiotics’ market globally.\nAccording to FAO/WHO recommendations, for a probiotics to declare claims of health benefits, it must contain a concentration of 106 to 107 CFU (Colony Forming Units) of viable probiotic bacteria. Therefore, probiotics must contain specific strains and maintain certain numbers of live cells for them to produce health benefits in the host.\nProbiotic bacteria should therefore remain alive from the time they are processed u0026amp; packaged by the manufacturer, to the time they are consumed and their settlement in the intestine. This gives rise to the two main challenges that face probiotics delivery i.e. Stability on the Shelf and Passage through the stomach (Gastric Acid) environment.\nMinimum Viable Cells\nDifferent countries have set minimum viable cells required in the probiotic product for it to be beneficial. E.g. Australia has a minimum viable count of 10(6) organisms per gram.\n- In Japan for example, a minimum of 10(7) viable cells per milliliter of fresh dairy product is required.\n- South Africa legislation requires that functional foods containing probiotics should deliver 10(8) bacterial cells per day.\nThe main challenge currently facing the probiotics market worldwide is the delivery of a viable colony of live bacteria to the target area – the intestines (ileum and colon) – where they are presumed to be active.\nRetention of viability of the probiotic bacteria presents a major challenge. Most of the active cultures die during manufacturing, storage or in transporting the finished product. In addition, most of them are destroyed during the passage through the stomach to the intestines.\nUnfortunately, the majority of probiotics die before you receive any health benefits outlined here. Two of the major challenges can therefore be summed up as follows:\nThe viability of probiotics under room temperatures has been a matter of concern in the industry. Most probiotics products take time from 2 months to 18 months on the pharmacy shelf before they can get to the final consumer.There is gradual deterioration and loss of bacteria during this period due to storage due to oxidation and other stress that impacts on the live bacteria.\nWater (moisture), high temperatures and oxygen have been regarded as the “enemies of stability“. Stability decreases – meaning that probiotic bacteria begin to die when they are exposed to high temperature, excessive moisture and exposure to air.\nRefrigerated products also have short lives due to negative effects of low temperature and formation of crystals on bacterial cells.\nShelf-life of most probiotic bacteria lead to degradation and reduced viability .\nThe number of viable bacteria continually decrease with time during storage. Market surveys have revealed much lower counts in the products before their expiry dates. Shelf life is therefore unpredictable and most probiotics have difficulty backing up label claims.\nTo compensate for this, excesses of 50 to 200% cells have been incorporated into products in an attempt to make up for cells that die during storage.\nTolerance of Stomach Acid and Bile\nMost probiotic material do not seem to transiently survive the harsh acidity in the stomach at pH below 2 (Highly Acidic).Lactobacilli spp. probiotic has been shown to only survive between 30 seconds to several minutes under these conditions.\nGlands located within the lining of your stomach produce a powerful stomach acid – hydrochloric acid. A thick layer of mucous lines your stomach, which prevents this acid from digesting your stomach. In the stomachs of most people, this mucous lining is able to resist the stomach acid, although food and other body tissues can’t.\nThis acid is useful in killing and destroying any harmful bacteria that might be ingested with food or while drinking. While being protective, it also destroys ‘good bacteria’ that you might ingest in form of probiotics.\nAccording to U.K. food microbiologist Glenn Gibson, quoted in a 2008 story in “The Sunday Times,” only a few highly resistant bacteria such as lactobacillus and bifidobacteria can survive stomach acid. Other types of bacteria, including many probiotics, are likely to be destroyed by stomach acid.\nAfter surviving the manufacturing process and degradation with time on the shelf, probiotics are exposed to harsh conditions prevailing in the stomach and small intestinebefore they reach their target site.']"	['<urn:uuid:36206af2-9d9a-47e4-9372-5743e3d9178e>', '<urn:uuid:8497f434-373c-429d-8cca-2ba104d88b41>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	14	120	1859

And He will say unto us, ‘Ye are swine, made in the image of the Beast and with his mark; but come ye also!’ And the wise ones and those of understanding will say, ‘O Lord, why dost Thou receive these men?’ And He will say, ’This is why I receive them, O ye wise, this is why I receive them, O ye of understanding, that not one of them believed himself to be worthy of this.’ And He will hold out His hands to us and we shall fall down before Him… and we shall weep… and we shall understand all things! Then we shall understand all!… and all will understand, Katerina Ivanovna even… she will understand… Lord, Thy kingdom come!” And he sank down on the bench exhausted and helpless, looking at no one, apparently oblivious of his surroundings and plunged in deep thought. His words had created a certain impression; there was a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were heard again.” ~ Marmeladov’s Vision from “Crime and Punishment”\nI AM THAT I AM. Yes, indeed, it is He Who is Being. He alone truly lives. Everything summoned from the abyss of non-being exists solely by His will. My individual life, down to the smallest detail, comes uniquely from Him. He fills the soul, binding her ever more intimately to Himself. Conscious contact with Him stamps a man for ever. Such a man will not now depart from the God of love Whom he has come to know. His mind is reborn. Hitherto he was inclined to see everywhere determined natural processes; now he begins to apprehend all things in the light of Person. Knowledge of the Personal God bears an intrinsically personal character. Like recognizes like. There is an end to the deadly tedium of the impersonal. The earth, the whole universe, proclaims Him: “heaven and earth praise him, the sea, and everything that moveth therein” (Ps. 69.34)…\nView original post 32 more words\nSt. Gregory of Nyssa (c. 335 – c. 395), is one of the three Great Cappadocian Fathers along with his older brother, St. Basil the Great, and friend, St. Gregory of Nazianzus. I especially love Gregory Nyssen for his deep spirituality and mysticism. He was a highly original and sophisticated thinker who remains controversial among both liberal and conservative theologians to this day. In his treatise The Life of Moses, St. Gregory tells us that a person’s encounter of the mystery of God corresponds to the three theophanies of Moses, involving successive entry into light, cloud, and darkness.\nAccording to St. Gregory Nyssen, the first stage in our quest to encounter God is Moses’ vision of God as the light of the burning bush; illuminating the darkness of our sin and ignorance. The second stage involves a journey from light into partial darkness where Moses encounters God as the ‘cloud’; the intermingling of light and darkness, revealing the distance between the Creator and the created realm. The third and final stage entails Moses entering the darkness of Sinai where God is; and our realization upon encountering and even being united with God that He is utterly incomprehensible in his essence.\nIn this treatment, I think, St. Gregory of Nyssa clearly identifies both cataphatic and apophatic theology, bridges the two and holds the tension between them, drawing the best from both.\n“What does it mean that Moses entered the darkness and then saw God in it? What is now recounted seems somehow to be contradictory to the first theophany, for then the divine was beheld in light but now He is seen in darkness. Let us not think that this is at variance with the sequence of things we have contemplated spiritually. Scripture teaches by this that religious knowledge comes at first to those who receive it as light. Therefore what is perceived to be contrary to religion is darkness; an escape from darkness comes about when one participates in the light. But as the mind progresses and, through an ever greater and more perfect diligence, comes to apprehend reality, as it approaches more nearly to contemplation, it sees more clearly that God cannot be contemplated. For leaving behind everything that is observed, not only what sense comprehends but also what the intelligence thinks it sees, it keeps on penetrating deeper until by the intelligence’s yearning for understanding it gains access to the invisible and the incomprehensible and there it sees God. This is the true knowledge of what is sought; this is the seeing that consists in not seeing, because that which is sought transcends all knowledge, being separated on all sides by incomprehensibility as by a kind of darkness. Therefore John the sublime who penetrated into the luminous darkness, says “no one has ever seen God,” thus asserting that knowledge of the divine essence is unattainable not only by humans but also by every intelligent creature. When, therefore, Moses grew in knowledge, he declared that he had seen God in the darkness, that is, that he had then come to know that what is divine is beyond all knowledge and comprehension, for the text says,‘Moses approached the dark cloud where God was’.” ~ The Life of Moses\n“All our attention must be centered on the parable of the Prodigal Son. We all see ourselves in it as in a mirror. In a few words the Lord, the knower of hearts, has shown in the person of one man how the deceptive sweetness of sin separates us from the truly sweet life according to God. He knows how the burden of sin on the soul and body, experienced by us, impels us by the action of divine grace to return, and how it actually does turn many again to God, to a virtuous life.”\n– St. John of Kronstadt']"	['<urn:uuid:a22a53e0-74e6-4d7f-a768-26a501ba11be>', '<urn:uuid:6e6d3c99-a545-4af0-85d2-6ed23c592e0d>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	8	32	3820
69	I'm researching how romantic relationships affect happiness - what's the difference between the impact of watching rom-coms versus actually getting married on someone's long-term happiness levels?	Research shows interesting contrasts between these two influences. For romantic comedies, studies found no significant relationship between frequently watching rom-coms and belief in idealistic notions about love (like 'love conquers all' or 'love at first sight'). The only slight effect was that viewers who watched specifically to learn about relationships were more likely to idealize their partners. As for marriage, studies revealed that getting married did not make people happier over time. While there was a brief 'honeymoon effect' where life satisfaction increased right after marriage, it then decreased steadily. Overall happiness neither increased nor decreased due to marriage, and relationship satisfaction actually decreased from before the wedding onwards. Even when looking at only couples who stayed married (excluding divorces), the decline in satisfaction was still present, just less dramatic.	['Romantic-comedy films are not a major source for developing unrealistic\nexpectations about relationships among young adults, finds a new study to be published\nonline this week in the National Communication Association’s journal Communication Monographs.\nof 335 undergraduate students in the Midwest found no significant relationship\nbetween reporting watching romantic comedies often and belief in the ideals\n“love conquers all,” “one and only” love (soul mate) and “love at first sight.”\nfindings discredit the popular assumption that exposure to romantic comedies is\na major source leading to unrealistic relational expectations among young\npeople,” said the study’s principal investigator, Veronica Hefner, Ph.D.,\nassistant professor of communication studies at Chapman University, Orange,\nthe online questionnaire survey at the University of Illinois at\nUrbana-Champaign with Barbara J. Wilson, Ph.D., the university’s executive vice\nprovost for faculty and academic affairs. The authors did find, however, that\nthose viewers of romantic comedies who reported watching with the motivation to\nlearn about relationships were slightly more likely to endorse romantic ideals\noverall and, in particular, the belief in “idealization of partner.” Idealizing\none’s partner includes believing that the partner should be flawless or will be\ncompletely accepting, loving, and understanding, according to Hefner.\nwith exposure to romantic comedies, a stronger influence on viewers’ beliefs\nabout relationships was the reason that young people watch these popular\nmovies, Hefner said.\nstudents who reported watching romantic comedies to learn about love and\nrelationships were more likely to endorse idealistic romantic beliefs than\nthose who watch for other reasons,” she said. “What really matters is not what\nyou watch, but why you watch.”\nthese students were more likely to believe in idealizing their partners than in\nromantic beliefs such as love at first sight, but Hefner pointed out that this\nidealization could have a positive social influence. Some studies have shown\nthat viewing one’s partner as wonderful and perfect was beneficial for a\nromantic relationship and was linked to higher levels of satisfaction in the\nhalf of the survey respondents reported they were currently in a relationship.\nStudents ranged in age from 18 to 26 years. Of the 335 respondents, 71 percent\nwere female and 29 percent were male.\nresearchers found no differences in responses about romantic beliefs between\nmen and women who responded to the survey. The lack of a sex difference in the\nfindings disputes another popular belief, Hefner said—“that women are the ones\nwho are most idealistic and most influenced by romantic comedies.\nthe researchers found that male characters in popular romantic comedies express\nromantic ideals more often than women do. In this separate study, published in\nthe same article, they performed a content analysis of the 52 top-grossing\nromantic comedy films between 1998 and 2008, including 2008’s “27 Dresses” and\nthe top-grossing “rom-com” of that period, “My Big Fat Greek Wedding.” Of the\n52 movies analyzed, 98 percent reportedly featured a romantic ideal expression,\nwhereas 75 percent of the films featured a romantic ideal takeaway message.\nIdeal expressions were any statements related to one of the four ideals. Takeaway messages were the overall\nimpressions of the films.\nideal statements expressed in these films, the most common were related to soul\nmates,” Hefner said, “whereas the most common takeaway ideal theme was the\nnotion that love conquers all.” Despite\nthis prevalence of idealism, however, the most commonly expressed statements in\nthese movies overall were actually realistic in nature. These practical expressions\nor challenges to the ideals, such as “relationships take hard work,” were twice\nas common in these films as were the idealistic comments.\nHefner said, “the bottom line is that the interactions and statements found in\nthese films are not idealistic at all.\nHowever, the larger themes of the movies are idealistic. It seems that the couples go through\nrealistic challenges and difficult obstacles, but resolve their differences\nwith ideal conclusions.”\narticle, “From Love at First Sight to Soul Mate: The Influence of Romantic\nIdeals in Popular Films on Young People’s Beliefs about Relationships,” appears\nonline on Friday, April 12, 2013 in Communication\nAbout The National Communication\nNational Communication Association (NCA) advances communication as the\ndiscipline that studies all forms, modes, media and consequences of\ncommunication through humanistic, social scientific, and aesthetic inquiry.

This is important.

You simply can’t generalize from simply those people available blanket guidance such, «get partnered and you’ll be more content» (because Dan Buettner, author of The Blue Zones, actually did in problem of the AARP journal).

70	I keep hearing about deaths from air pollution - can you tell me exactly how many people die from it worldwide and what specific health problems cause these deaths?	Air pollution causes approximately 7 million preventable deaths worldwide. Up to one-third of deaths from heart attack, stroke, lung cancer, and chronic respiratory diseases are due to air pollution. Additionally, household air pollution alone was responsible for 3.8 million premature deaths in 2016, including over 400,000 deaths of children under age 5. These deaths occur because air pollution can increase the risk of respiratory conditions from pneumonia to lung cancer, worsen symptoms of asthma and bronchitis, and cause cardiovascular problems.	['Around the world, 9 out of 10 people breathe air that has been polluted by traffic emissions, industry, agriculture and waste incineration.\nAbout 3 billion people continue to use smoky, polluting stoves and fuels inside their homes for cooking and heating.\nOur latest estimates are that up to one-third of deaths from heart attack, stroke, lung cancer and chronic respiratory diseases are due to air pollution.\nNo one escapes, from the womb to the grave.\nSome of our children will not reach their full potential because of exposure to air pollution in the womb and in early life; some of our parents will die early because of exposure to it throughout their lives.\nAnd in many parts of the world, it’s getting worse.\nThe most tragic thing about these 7 million deaths is that they are so preventable.\nBut the fact that they are preventable should give us reason for optimism. There is something we can do.\nIt will require strong political will, swift action and endurance, but I am optimistic that we can, and must, do better.\nI’m optimistic because we have everything we need to take action.\nWe have overwhelming evidence of the harm that air pollution does;\nWe have hard figures to demonstrate the heavy burden of air pollution on human health, economies and food security — and the staggering opportunity cost of inaction;\nAnd I fully agree, Fiona actually said it in a better way, that the cost of action is high but the cost of inaction is even greater.\nWe have overwhelming evidence of the harm that air pollution does. We have had figures to demonstrate the heavy burden of air pollution on human health, economies and food security and the staggering opportunity cost of inaction.\nAnd we have many proven solutions in almost all areas that contribute to air pollution, and more are emerging all the time.\nI am optimistic because we are seeing more and more examples of cities, regions and countries around the world that are taking action.\nI am optimistic because more and more people are arming themselves with information, and are speaking out for their right to breathe clean air.\nThere is much that we can do to improve air quality, but we must all play our part.\nWHO is taking on the battle against air pollution because its devastating health impacts make it our fight, too.\nWe are empowering health professionals to explain the risks of air pollution to their patients and how best to reduce those risks.\nBut we’re also giving them the skills and evidence to be advocates for health in policy decisions that impact air quality and public health.\nThrough global commitments such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Climate Accord and the Urban Agenda 2030, WHO is building alliances with partners working in energy, climate and environment.\nWe are working to engage actors in transport, urban planning, housing, energy, and environment, by giving them the tools, resources and support to evaluate the health impacts of their policy decisions.\nExcellencies, ladies and gentlemen,\nNo person, group, city, country or region can solve the problem alone. We need strong commitments and action from everyone: governments, community leaders, mayors, civil society, the private sector, and individuals.\nWe need all countries and cities to commit to meeting WHO standards for air quality in the next 12 years.\nWe need to agree unequivocally on the need for a world free of air pollution.\nWe need common goals for our common future, such as reducing the number of deaths from air pollution.\nThis is the challenge before us.\nThank you for your commitment. And together we have the opportunity this week to take practical steps to ensure that our children and our grandchildren breathe cleaner air.\nI urge all of you to seize that opportunity with both hands.\nI thank you.', 'Air pollution has become a global health problem, especially in urban areas. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), household air pollution was responsible for 3.8 million premature deaths in 2016, including over 400,000 deaths of children under the age of 5 years. Did you know more than 90% of the world’s children breathe toxic air every day? India is considered to be one of the top 10 highly polluted countries in the world. In fact, a recent study  has reported that around 99% of India’s population encounters air pollution levels that exceed the World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines, indicating almost every one of us are breathing polluted air.\nAre You At Risk Of Air Pollution?\nAir pollution is known to be emerging as an invisible killer in recent years with an increased rate of morbidity and mortality. Although it threatens people of all ages, right from infants to elders, children are most vulnerable.\nUnlike adults, children’s lungs are not fully developed, which increases the risk of inflammation and organ damage caused by pollutants. Also, their immune system is not properly developed thereby further increasing their risk of suffering from severe health complications due to pollution. They breathe faster than adults, taking in more air and, with it, more pollutants. Also, kids have shorter and narrower airways and they breathe through their mouths often. This increases the risk of breathing in more pollutants and dust, which gets absorbed and settled in the lungs, respiratory tract and blood vessels.\nNewborns and infants spend the most time on the floor where some pollutants reach peak concentrations. They do spend most of their time indoors, which increases the susceptibility to household air pollution. As compared to adults who spend most of the time in the office, children spend much time outside, playing and engaging in physical activity in potentially polluted air from traffic, power plants, and other combustion sources. The risk is also high during pregnancy as exposure to air pollutants before conception can also impose latent risks on the fetus that can lead to illness and other health problems that last a lifetime.\nAir pollution can:\n-Increase the risk of respiratory conditions right from pneumonia to lung cancer\n-Worsen the symptoms of wheezing, asthma, bronchitis, COPD, and other respiratory conditions\n-Lead to impaired lung development in kids\n-Increase the risk of retinopathy and ocular problems such as dry eyes, eye pain,\n-Lead to skin problems such as irritation, redness, hives, and allergy\n-Increase blood pressure and heart rate thereby putting you at risk of heart disease\n-Cause serious complications in the immune system\n-Have damaging effects on the nervous system including cognitive impairment in kids\n-Up the risk of low birth weight babies and preterm delivery in pregnant women\nTips to protect yourself against pollution\nHere are a few simple ways to fight air pollution and protect your family from the harmful effects of air pollution.\n1. Stay indoors, preferably in the morning\nAvoid going for morning walks and outdoor activities as air pollution is said to be worse in the morning. So exercising outdoors in the early hours can do more harm than good as you might end up breathing polluted air. As kids tend to play outside, it is important to restrict their playtime when the pollutant levels are high.\n2. Use anti-pollution masks/nasal filters\nPoor quality of air makes it important to use a mask. But paper masks, stoles/handkerchiefs, and surgical masks offer no significant protection against the harmful air pollutants. Opt for N95/N99 respiratory masks which filter out particulate matter and help you to breathe cleaner air. Nasal filters also work effectively in filtering polluted air.\n3. Prefer public transport or carpooling\nOpt for public transport or carpooling instead of private vehicles to reduce traffic and pollution. This way you can do your bit in reducing pollution in your city. Avoid areas that are highly congested to lower the risk of pollution.\n4. Invest in indoor plants\nIndoor plants have been found to absorb the poisonous gaseous contaminants through their leaves and roots and help you to fight indoor pollution. Invest in indoor plants such as aloe vera, peace lily, spider plant and bamboo palm that you can add to your workplace and house.\n5. Use air purifiers\nOne of the most simple and effective ways to improve indoor air quality and prevent the health risks associated with household pollution is to buy an air purifier. Using air purifiers can significantly reduce the level of pollutants in your room and help you breathe clean air.\nAir pollution is an alarming global health crisis with grave consequences on the health right from kids to elders. However, with simple tips and tricks, you can fight pollution at home and help your family breathe clean air because #Hawa Saaf Ho Na Ho, Lungs Saaf Hone Chahiye for a healthy life.\n(The article is reviewed by Dr. Swati Mishra, Medical Editor)\n1.

71	How does physical strength affect anger, and what role does patience play?	Physical strength significantly influences anger-proneness and attitudes towards conflict. According to research, stronger individuals, especially men, are more prone to anger, feel more entitled to better treatment, and more strongly endorse the use of force to resolve both interpersonal and international conflicts. This is because strength increases one's social bargaining power. However, patience is taught as the better approach - the Holy Prophet Muhammad emphasized that true strength lies in controlling anger, not in physical prowess. He taught that a strongman is not one who wrestles others down, but one who controls his anger. Furthermore, patience in the face of hurt increases one's honor, and when a believer faces difficulties with patience, Allah makes it a source of atonement for their lapses.	"['In the Name of Allah, The Most Gracious, Ever Merciful.\nLove for All, Hatred for None.\nNOTE: Alislam Team takes full responsibility for any errors or miscommunication in this Synopsis of the Friday Sermon\nAnd those who believe and do good works - them shall We surely house in lofty mansions of Paradise, beneath which rivers flow. They will abide therein. Excellent is the reward of those who work good. (29:59)\nThe Holy prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) raised a nation of believers who were advanced in faith. He was the last prophet and faith attained perfection through him. Allah\'s pleasure can be attained through acting on this faith. His companions advanced in faith and it became a source of peace and approval from the Almighty for them.\nAn action which is to attract the pleasure of the Almighty is a righteous action (\'Aml Salih). The verse recited at the beginning mentions those who brought about a great revolution through the training and heavenly power of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be on him). They attained such strength that they presented the greatest sacrifices for the sakes of righteous standing.\nWhen they were asked to bear persecution, they complied and did not respond to harshness with harshness. When they were asked to leave their homes, they complied and migrated. When they were allowed to defend themselves, they took up arms and punished the enemy.\nIn this verse, Allah the Almighty says that when a believer\'s actions become subordinate to the will of the Almighty, and he considers his life as a trust from Him, Allah will admit such people into Paradise due the sacrifices they present with steadfastness.\nThe strength of the faith of the companions and the strength to steadfastly carry out righteous actions were created through the spiritual power of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah on him).\nI relate from Ahadith some examples of the sublime examples of the steadfastness and persistence shown by the companions in their daily lives and in the thick of the battle with the enemy. These examples illustrate how to act in different circumstances.\nAhadith indicate how a person should be steadfast in their family life. I have received reports and letters that some ladies are teased by their in-laws that they bore daughters only. The Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) said that if a person is tried through having daughters only, his daughters will be a barrier between him and the fire in the next world.\nSome people are easily excitable and do not socialize. The Holy prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) said that a person who socializes and bears inconveniences and hurtful behavior patiently is better than a person who does not socialize and does not show patience and steadfastness in the face of hurtful treatment.\nA person should undertake the reformation and the betterment of the society. Patience enhances forbearance leading to opportunities for further righteous acts. Members should cultivate patience and avoid frictions emanating from impatience.\nThe Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) said that a strongman is not the one who wrestles the other down but the one who controls his anger.\nHadrat A\'ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) related that the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be on him) never hit anyone with his own hand except for in a battle and never retaliated except to hold the honor of God high.\nThe Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) said that patience in the face of a hurt increases one\'s honor.\nThe Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) marveled at the fate of a Muslim that he is rewarded when he is steadfast in difficulty. He shows gratefulness in good circumstances leading to blessings and shows patience in difficulty leading to blessings. Any trouble a Muslim endures, Allah makes it a source of atonement for his lapses. Allah likes a person who is patient in face of the trouble caused to him by his neighbor.\nHadrat Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said that patience in faith is as a head on a body.\nThe Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) taught us that when a believer is afflicted by a misfortune, he says, ""Surely, to Allah we belong and to Him shall we return"" (2:157)\nAnd that, Allah, bless me with a better alternate.\nAllah, the Almighty, declares the same in the Holy Qur’an, ""Who, when a misfortune overtakes them, say, \'Surely, to Allah we belong and to Him shall we return.\' (2:157)\nIt is these on whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy, and it is these who are rightly guided. (2:158)\nNow I relate some instances of the steadfastness of the companions who benefited from the training of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) and showed excellent example of patience and steadfastness.\nHadrat A\'ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) relates that the early Muslims were put in the trial of persecution. Her father, Hadrat Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) decided to migrate to Habshah. A friend of his told him that neither a good person like him should migrate nor should be forced to migrate, and provided him his protection on the condition that he would pray inside his house. Hadrat Abu Bakr (may Allah be please with him) established a mosque in the yard of his house to pray and recited the Qur\'an loudly. The neighbors would see him over the wall of his home. The non-believers complained. His friend asked him to desist or revoke his protection. Hadrat Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) revoked his protection. Then he was tormented, beaten, and his hair on his beard and head were pulled.\nThe Ahmadis in Pakistan are stopped from offering their Prayers. Maulawis reported to police this week that the Ahmadis should be stopped from offering sacrifices of animals. Police summoned the Ahmadis and warned them that they should sacrifice animals within the walls of their homes and that they do not have the right to hurt the feelings of other Muslims. Ahmadis told the police that they already confine their activities to the walls of their homes and do not conduct them outside their homes but yet the Maulawis are bent on mischief.\nIt is related that a lady preached Islam secretly. The non-believers tied her to a camel and traveled for three days. They did not give her anything to eat or drink. They secured the camel in sun and went in shade. She saw water and reached it and drank it and sprayed some on her body to alleviate the effects of intense heat. When the non-believers returned, they saw her in better condition and noticed the signs of water splashes. They thought that she had freed herself and had drank from their water. She denied their allegations and told her story. They checked their water and found that it was the same amount as before. They said that such a faith is true and accepted Islam.\nHadrat Bilal (may Allah be pleased with him) was laid with naked back on hot surface and weight was put on him to hold him down while he continued saying, the One, the One. Hadrat Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) secured his freedom in exchange for another slave.\nDuring the time of the Khilafat of Hadrat Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), Hadrat Khabbab (may Allah be pleased with him) told him that there were people to save Bilal but there was no one to save him from the torments of the non-believers. Once he was thrown in burning fire and was pushed down onto it. He showed Hadrat Umar the marks resulting from the torture. His owner used to put burning iron rod over his head. She was afflicted with some disease and was advised to have her head touched with burning iron rod. She had to ask Hadrat Khabbab to carry out this treatment. This way Hadrat Khabbab saw the reward of his patience himself.\nThe Promised Messiah (peace be on him) has so said: Our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) never raised sword himself. He bore torment with perseverance, and so did his companions. The companions were trampled under feet. Their children were cut into pieces. They were tortured. Despite their bravery, their strength and their power, they did not rise against attacks and were patient for thirteen years. Their patient was not due to helplessness but rather they had laid down their arms in compliance with heavenly instructions. We do not find such morals in any other nations. This example is without parallel. They did not undertake defense until they were directed after their migration to Mecca.\nMay Allah allow us to continue to show patience and steadfastness, and may He create circumstances for the seizure of the enemy, and may we continue to inherit the blessings of Allah. Amin.\nThe Jumu\'ah (Friday) prayer is one form of congregational worship in Islam. It takes place every Friday. Regular attendance at the Jumu\'ah prayer is enjoined on the believer. According to a Saying of Muhammadsa this congregational prayer is twenty-five times more blessed than worship performed alone. (Bukhari)\n“O ye who believe! When the call is made for Prayer on Friday, hasten to the remembrance of Allah, and leave off all business. That is best for you, if you only knew.” more\n“… (He who) offers the Prayers and listens quitely when the Imam stands up for sermon, will have his sins forgiven between that Friday and the next”(Bukhari)', 'Anger as an evolved bargaining system: Empirical Tests\nResearchers at the Center for Evolutionary Psychology have been investigating the design and evolved function of the emotion of anger, both theoretically and empirically. They consider anger to be a behavior-regulating program that was built into the neural architecture of the human species over evolutionary time. The key question is, why?\nThe new model—the recalibrational theory of anger—proposes that anger (as an emotion program) was designed by natural selection to nonconsciously orchestrate the individual’s responses to interpersonal conflicts of interest so that the individual bargains effectively. The functional product of the anger (if successful) is the recalibration upwards of the other person’s tendency to place weight on the angry person’s welfare. The two bargaining tools humans have is the ability to confer or withhold benefits, and the ability to inflict costs. The greater the benefits an individual controls, or the greater the costs the individual can inflict, the greater the bargaining position he or she has. The theory predicts, and these studies find, that stronger men and more attractive women are more anger-prone, feel more entitled to better treatment, and prevail more in conflicts of interest. They also more strongly endorse the use of force to resolve conflicts. These results undermine theories that attribute anger and aggression primarily to frustration, a history of negative treatment, or a desire for equity. According to this theory, strength and beauty are not unique: anything that increases the social bargaining power of an individual should increase her or his anger-proneness and feeling of entitlement.\nThe paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences is the first in a series on anger:\nFormidability and the logic of human anger by Aaron Sell, John Tooby & Leda Cosmides, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences August 2009.\nABSTRACT: Eleven predictions derived from the recalibrational theory of anger were tested. This theory proposes that anger is produced by a neurocognitive program engineered by natural selection to use bargaining tactics to resolve conflicts of interest in favor of the angry individual. The program is designed to orchestrate two interpersonal negotiating tactics (conditionally inflicting costs or conditionally withholding benefits) to incentivize the target of the anger to place greater weight on the welfare of the angry individual. Individuals with enhanced abilities to inflict costs (e.g., stronger individuals) or to confer benefits (e.g., attractive individuals) have a better bargaining position in conflicts; hence, it was predicted that such individuals will be more prone to anger, prevail more in conflicts of interest, and consider themselves entitled to better treatment. These predictions were confirmed. Consistent with an evolutionary analysis, the effect of strength on anger was greater for men and the effect of attractiveness on anger was greater for women. Also as predicted, stronger men had a greater history of fighting than weaker men, and more strongly endorsed the efficacy of force to resolve conflicts—both in interpersonal and international conflicts. The fact that stronger men favored greater use of military force in international conflicts provides evidence that the internal logic of the anger program reflects the ancestral payoffs characteristic of a small-scale social world rather than rational assessments of modern payoffs in large populations.\nUCSB’s press release can be found here\nSupplemental information here\nNew! The Sunday Times of London recently published a piece claiming that researchers at the CEP found a link between blonde hair in women and anger, entitlement and ""warlike"" behavior. No such research was done, and we believe the claims of the article are false. As can be seen by a search in our original publication (here) the words ""blonde"" or even ""hair"" never appear. Nevertheless, the story spread rapidly throughout the blogosphere and the mainstream news. We are working to correct the story. Click here to read our letter to the Times.\nWhat we did do was research on the evolved function of anger, and its relationship to variables such as strength and attractiveness (much more interesting, and with facts behind it!).\nUpdate!

It characterizes the evolved function of anger and describes how some of the design features of the anger program carry out this evolved function.\n(2) tests eleven predictions derived from the theory, including a functional explanation for individual differences in anger-proneness.\n(3) provides evidence that upper body strength is linked to beliefs and attitudes about the use of the military in international conflicts, indicating that at least some of our attitudes are set nonrationally.\nEarlier, related work provides evidence that humans have an evolved specialization for assessing fighting ability—formidability: See Human adaptations for the visual assessment of strength and fighting ability from the body and face by Aaron Sell, Leda Cosmides, John Tooby, Daniel Sznycer, Christopher von Rueden, and Michael Gurven in Proceedings of the Royal Society London, (Biological Sciences), October 2008.

73	terraform gitops benefits security risks	Terraform in GitOps offers several benefits for infrastructure management, including version control of infrastructure code, automated change deployment through pull requests, and unified management of multi-cloud environments. However, this setup also involves security risks, particularly related to open ports that are required for remote services. These ports can provide attackers with opportunities for compromise through unpatched vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or clear text communications. To mitigate these risks, it's essential to use encrypted traffic, implement strong password policies, and keep underlying technologies fully patched.	"['What Is Terraform?\nTerraform, developed by HashiCorp, is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool. It provides a consistent approach to provisioning, changing, and managing your infrastructure. Infrastructure can mean anything from physical servers to containers or SaaS products. Terraform treats all these infrastructural components as resources, and it works by creating an execution plan describing what it will do to reach the desired state of these resources.\nAn important aspect of Terraform is its provider ecosystem. Terraform Providers are plugins that Terraform uses to interact with APIs for various services. This allows Terraform to manage a broad spectrum of resources including public cloud providers, cloud automation systems, container orchestration platforms, Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD) tools, monitoring systems, networking tools, and more.\nWhat Is GitOps?\nGitOps is a methodology that applies the principles of Git, a widely-used version control system, to infrastructure and operations. The core idea behind GitOps is that Git serves as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. With Git at the center of the delivery pipelines, every change is versioned, traceable, and auditable.\nIn GitOps, the desired state of the infrastructure is stored in a Git repository. Operations teams use pull requests to make changes, which are then automatically applied to the system. This approach ensures consistency and reliability in deployment processes and reduces the chances of human error. Tools like ArgoCD are commonly used in GitOps to sync the state in the Git repository with the state in the environment, typically Kubernetes.\nGitOps promotes collaboration and visibility among teams. Developers and operators can see the entire history of changes, discuss modifications, and roll back to previous states if necessary. This way, GitOps bridges the gap between development and operations, fostering a more integrated and efficient workflow.\nWhy Use Terraform for GitOps?\nTerraform’s declarative nature aligns well with the GitOps principle of storing the desired state of infrastructure as code. This combination enhances automation, consistency, and reproducibility in infrastructure management. Using Terraform in a GitOps workflow offers several advantages:\n- Terraform defines infrastructure using a high-level configuration language: This code can be version-controlled in Git, making it easy to track changes, review updates, and maintain a historical record of the infrastructure state. In a GitOps model, when a pull request is merged, an automated process can trigger Terraform to apply the changes, ensuring that the actual state of the infrastructure matches the desired state.\n- Terraform can manage multi-cloud environments: This means a GitOps setup with Terraform can handle diverse infrastructure providers with a single workflow, making it easier to maintain complex systems. This unified approach reduces complexity and the risk of errors, particularly in large-scale environments with multiple cloud services.\n- Terraform’s plan and apply stages can be applied to GitOps pipelines: The plan stage provides a preview of changes, which can be reviewed as part of the pull request process. The apply stage is then executed automatically to make the actual changes, ensuring a controlled and predictable deployment process. This integration streamlines operations and enhances the security and stability of the infrastructure.\nHow to GitOps Your Terraform in 4 Steps\nHere are the high-level steps you will need to take to use Terraform in a GitOps model, which some have called “GitOpsing Terraform”.\n1. Set Up a Git Repository to Store Your Terraform Code\nTo begin, establish a Git repository to store your Terraform configurations. This repository acts as the central location for your infrastructure code, enabling version control and collaboration. Choose a Git hosting service like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, and create a new repository specifically for your Terraform code.\nWhen setting up your repository, consider organizing your Terraform configurations into directories that reflect your infrastructure’s logical structure. For instance, you might have separate directories for network, compute, and storage resources. Include a README file to explain the repository structure and any guidelines for contributing to the codebase. It’s also advisable to implement branch protection rules to prevent direct pushes to the main branch and enforce code review practices through pull requests.\n2. Configure Your Infrastructure Using Terraform Code\nThe next step is to configure your infrastructure using Terraform code. Terraform uses a declarative language, which means you specify what your infrastructure should look like, and Terraform will make it so.\nFirst, you need to write a Terraform configuration file. This file describes the resources that make up your infrastructure. For example, it might specify a virtual machine, a database, and a network. Terraform uses providers to interact with cloud providers—you will need to specify a provider for your infrastructure. For example, if you’re using AWS, you will use the AWS provider.\nOnce you’ve written your configuration file and specified your provider, you can use the\nterraform init command to initialize your Terraform working directory. This command downloads the necessary provider plugins and sets up the backend for storing your Terraform state.\nNote: You should only run\nterraform init once.\n3. Create a Pipeline That Uses Terraform to Apply Changes to Your Infrastructure\nAfter configuring your infrastructure with Terraform code, the next step is to create a pipeline that uses Terraform to apply changes to your infrastructure.\nA pipeline is a series of steps that are executed in order to transform your code from source to a final deployable outcome. In our case, the final outcome is the updated infrastructure that reflects the changes in our Terraform code.\nYou can use any continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) tool to create your pipeline. Some popular choices are Jenkins and Codefresh. The general process is to define a pipeline configuration file, which specifies the steps of your pipeline. At a minimum, your pipeline should include steps to checkout your code, initialize Terraform, plan your changes, and apply your changes.\n4. Use Pull Requests to Manage Changes to Your Infrastructure\nOnce you create your pipeline, you can start using pull requests to manage changes to your infrastructure. Pull requests are a way to propose changes to a codebase. They allow you to review, discuss, and eventually merge changes into the main codebase.\nWhen you want to make a change to your infrastructure, you can create a new branch in your Git repository. Then, you can make your changes in this branch. Once you’re done, you can create a pull request to propose your changes.\nThe pull request will trigger your pipeline, which will apply your changes in a safe and controlled way. If the pipeline succeeds, you can merge the pull request to apply your changes to the main codebase. The pipeline will then use Terraform to apply your changes to the live environment.\nAn Example: Creating a GitOps Pipeline with Codefresh and Terraform to Make Changes in AWS\nFirst, install the Codefresh CLI using npm installer using the command\nnpm install -g codefresh.\nNow let’s see how to create a GitOps pipeline with Codefresh and Terraform. First, create a\ncodefresh.yml file, which defines your pipeline steps.\nYou should place this file in the root directory of your Git repository containing the Terraform code. The pipeline file could look like this:\ntitle: ""Cloning main repository""\ntitle: ""Terraform Init""\n- terraform init\ntitle: ""Terraform Plan""\n- terraform plan\ntitle: ""Terraform Apply""\n- terraform apply -auto-approve\n- master # or any branch you prefer\nThis pipeline uses the following steps:\n- main_clone: This step clones your repository.\n- terraform_init: This step initializes the Terraform environment.\n- terraform_plan: Here, Terraform will create an execution plan.\n- terraform_apply: This final step applies the changes. The -auto-approve flag automatically applies the plan. For production environments, it might be safer to require manual approval.\nTo allow this pipeline to make changes in your AWS environment, you will need to integrate with AWS. Ensure that Codefresh has access to your AWS credentials. You can set this up as environment variables in Codefresh or use an IAM role if Codefresh runs within AWS.\nNow, you can configure the pipeline to trigger on push to specific branches, such as master, or on pull request creation. When developers raise pull requests with Terraform changes, and they are reviewed and merged into the main branch, the pipeline automatically applies these changes to AWS.', 'Open ports and their vulnerabilities\n(Last updated on December 3, 2021)\nOne of the age-old tenets of good network security is only open network ports that are necessary and make sure you have protection around any port open to the outside world.\nOpen ports provide attackers with an opportunity to compromise your environment. Let’s look at commonly opened ports, their vulnerabilities, and why these can be dangerous.\nWhat is an open port?\nAn open port is a network port that accepts traffic either using TCP or UDP and allows communication with underlying server technologies. Open ports are required when hosting remote services to which end-users can connect.\nWhy are ports open in the first place?\nMany of the common technologies on the Internet and allow communication rely on open ports to work. Standard technologies like web servers, FTP file transfers, voice-over-IP (VOIP), name resolution, and many other common technologies that allow network traffic to traverse the Internet use specific ports and technologies for communication.\nWhat is the difference between TCP and UDP\nYou will note that ports are defined as being TCP or UDP ports. Both TCP and UDP operate in the transport layer of the TCP/IP stack and use the IP protocol. What is the difference between TCP and UDP? Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is connection-oriented. It includes built-in error recovery and re-transmission.\nUser Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol that does not require acknowledgment of delivery. It helps to improve the performance of UDP compared to TCP at the sacrifice of guaranteed delivery.\nCommon open ports\nThere are specific network ports associated with technologies and network communications standards in the enterprise environment, specifically in a Windows network. What are these? Note the following ports and their associated communication technologies:\n- TCP port 21 FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – Provides a way to transfer files between computers that operate on the simple get and put concepts to either receive or send files to a remote endpoint. FTP was not intended to be a secure means of communication\n- TCP port 22 SSH (Secure Shell) – The purpose of SSH is to provide administrators the ability to connect to an endpoint over an unsecured network securely\n- TCP port 23 Telnet – allows interacting with a network endpoint from the command line and is sometimes used as a tool for remote management\n- TCP port 25 SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) – a protocol used to relay mail from email server to email server\n- TCP and UDP port 53 DNS (Domain Name System) – a protocol used for name resolution across the Internet. It traverses port 53 using TCP and UDP connections. DNS is responsible for converting the IP addresses that are non-intuitive to the human-friendly domain names typed into a web browser\n- TCP port 110 POP3 – Known as the Post Office Protocol, it is used by email clients to synchronize and download mail from remote mail servers\n- TCP port 145 IMAP – Internet Message Access Protocol synchronizes and displays emails without the need to download them\n- TCP ports 80 & 443 HTTP and HTTPS – HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transport Protocol over SSL) are today’s web servers’ standard protocols and ports. HTTP port 80 is the legacy, insecure protocol and port in use, while HTTPS is the secured web server protocol and port used for encrypted web communications. Most organizations have deprecated the use of HTTP across the board as it is clear text and insecure communication\n- TCP port 81 – Commonly used as a web proxy port\n- TCP and UDP port 135, 137, 139 — Windows Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and Windows NetBIOS over TCP/IP are well-known in Windows networking. These communicate over TCP and UDP ports 135, 137, and 139 and historically have many vulnerabilities\n- TCP port 1433 SQL – Microsoft SQL Server, used throughout many enterprise organizations today communicates over TCP port 1433.\n- TCP port 3306 MySQL – This port is used for MySQL database communication\n- TCP port 3389 RDP – Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is used to display remote GUI desktop sessions of a remote Windows computer. It is commonly used with Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments.\n- TCP port 5900 VNC – VNC is a tool that is commonly used for remote access administration. It communicates on TCP port 5900.\nVulnerabilities of open ports\nAs mentioned at the outset, open ports provide a more extensive “attack surface” or opportunity for an attacker to find vulnerabilities, exploits, misconfigurations, and other risks due to the allowed network communication over a specific network port.\nIt is not necessarily the open port that is the risk, but the underlying technology and infrastructure “listening” on that port. After all, the port and listener are simply the door. The technology behind the door is what leads to compromise. As an example, Apache, NGINX, or Tomcat may be the webserver used for listening to port 80/443 traffic. Therefore, attackers may look for specific vulnerabilities in Apache, NGINX, or Tomcat to attempt to attack the environment.\nAlso, clear text and unencrypted protocols can lead to network “snooping”. For example, an attacker can view passwords and other sensitive information transmitted in cleartext using a network tool that can capture network traffic, such as Wireshark.\nHow to protect an open port\nWhen it comes to protecting open ports, the first step is only to use ports that encrypt traffic. It means that an attacker cannot easily capture network traffic and decipher sensitive information. Organizations also want to scrutinize and decide if an open port is necessary. As mentioned at the outset, any open port increases the attack surface and the potential for compromise due to vulnerabilities, misconfiguration, and other factors.\nOpen ports to the Internet should sit behind a modern firewall or another filtering device to scrutinize traffic connecting to the open port. It ensures the communication is meant to be valid communication with the technology listening on that port or if it has malicious intentions.\nOpen ports should also be segmented from your internal network in what is known as a DMZ or demilitarized zone. If an attacker compromises the open network port, it is easier to contain the malicious activity if segmented from the rest of the network.\nPassword-protected services that are listening on an open port require organizations to protect the passwords used to authenticate services on these ports. Aside from never using cleartext protocols, this point emphasizes the need to have strong password policies that prevent weak, breached, or easily guessable passwords.\nLast, but perhaps the most important, make sure the underlying technologies and systems listening and answering on the open port are fully patched, and security updates are applied as soon as possible. Attackers often look for unpatched vulnerabilities to compromise an open port. In addition to the strategies mentioned above for protecting open ports, auditing, and other cybersecurity strategies, businesses must enforce strong passwords and use strong password policies.\nStrengthen passwords in your environment\nPasswords often are used to authenticate users on open ports. Unfortunately, password-authenticated services securing open ports are vulnerable to attack and password compromise. What best practices need to be considered?\n- Never use cleartext network protocols\n- Audit open network ports\n- Use strong password policies and breached password protection\nSpecops Password Policy allows organizations to extend the native capabilities found in Active Directory Password Policy and easily add breached password protection and many other features such as multiple password dictionaries, length-based aging, and other features.\nSpecops Password Auditor allows quickly seeing the password risks in the environment and auditing password policies that are used currently with industry best practice recommendations.\nGain visibility into existing password policies and if these meet with industry best practices.']"	['<urn:uuid:5f280157-35a3-41a7-b58d-d306bf9b71f1>', '<urn:uuid:2fc14997-88fc-491d-8309-4d86de47da68>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	5	82	2652
74	haskell influence modern programming languages development examples	Haskell has been highly influential in modern programming language development. Philip Wadler, one of Haskell's creators, helped implement generics in Java. Martin Odersky, who created Scala (which borrowed heavily from Haskell), also worked on Java generics. Erik Meijer, a Haskell enthusiast, used Haskell's monad concepts to create LINQ for C#. Even Java, traditionally object-oriented, has adopted functional programming features like generics and lambda expressions.	"[""The definition of functional programming is quite easy. Functional programming is the programming with mathematical functions. Is that all? Of course, not!\nFunctional programming is the programming with mathematical functions. I think, you already guess it. The key to this definition is the expression mathematical function. Mathematical functions are functions that return every time the same result when given the same arguments. They behave like an infinite big lookup table.\nThe property, that a function (expression) always returns the same result when given the same arguments, is called referential transparency. Referential transparency has far reaching consequences:\n- Mathematical functions can not have a side effect and can therefore not change the state outside the function body.\n- The function call can be replaced with its result, but can also be reordered or put on a different thread.\n- The program flow is defined by the data dependencies and not by the sequence of instructions.\n- Mathematical functions are a lot easier to refactor and to test because you can reason about the function in isolation.\nThat sounds very promising. But which so many advantages, there is a massive restriction. Mathematical functions can not talk to the outside world. Examples?\nMathematical functions can't\n- get user input or read from files.\n- write to the console of into a file.\n- return random numbers or time, because the return values are different.\n- build a state.\nThanks to mathematical functions, the definition of functional is very concise but helps not so much. The key question still remains. How can you program something useful with functional programming? Mathematical functions are like islands that have no communication with the outside world. Or to say it in the words of Simon Peyton Jones, one of the fathers of Haskell. The only effect that mathematical functions can have is to warm up your room.\nNow I will be a little bit more elaborated. What are the characteristics of functional programming languages?\nCharacteristics of functional programming languages\nHaskell will help me a lot on my tour through the characteristics of functional programming.\nThere are two reasons for using Haskell.\n- Haskell is a pure functional programming language and therefore you can study very well the characteristics of functional programming by using Haskell.\n- Haskell may be the most influential programming language of the last 10 - 15 years.\nMy second statement needs a proof. I will provide them in the next post for Python and in particular C++. Therefore, a few words about Java, Scala, and C#.\n- Philip Wadler, another father of Haskell, was one of the implementors of generics in Java.\n- Martin Odersky, the father of Scala, that adapted a lot from Haskell, was also involved in the implementation of generics in Java.\n- Erik Meijer is a passionate admirer and researcher around Haskell. He used the Haskell concepts of monads and created the well know C# library LINQ.\nI will even go one step further. How knows functional programming and in particular Haskell, know, how the mainstream programming languages will develop in the next years. Even a pure object-oriented language like Java can not withstand the pressure of the functional ideas. Java has now generics and lambda expressions.\nBut now back to my subject. What are the characteristics of functional programming languages?\nOn my search for the functional characteristics, I identified seven typical properties. These must not be all characteristics and each functional programming language has not to support them. But the characteristics helps a lot to bring meat to the abstract definition of functional programming.\nThe graphic gives, on one hand, the characteristics of functional programming and gives, on the other hand, the outline of my next posts. I will provide a lot of examples in Haskell, C++, and Python. But what do the seven characteristics mean?\nFirst-class Functions are typical for functional programming languages. These functions can accept functions as an argument or return functions. Therefore, the functions have to be higher-order functions. That means, they behave like data. Pure functions always return the same result when given the same arguments and can not have a side effect. They are the reason that Haskell is called a pure functional language. A pure functional language has only immutable data. That means, they can not have a while or for loop which is based on a counter. Instead of the loops, they use recursion. The key characteristic of functional programming is that you can easy compose functions. This is because of their bread and butter data structure list. If an expression evaluates its arguments immediately, it's called greedy or eager evaluation. If the expression evaluates the arguments only, if needed, it's called lazy evaluation. Lazy evaluation will reduce time and memory if the evaluated expression is not needed. I think, you already guess it. The classical programming languages are greedy. They evaluate their expressions immediately.\nI start in my next post with first-class functions. We have them since the beginning of C++.\nThanks a lot to my Patreon Supporters: Matt Braun, Roman Postanciuc, Tobias Zindl, Marko, G Prvulovic, Reinhold Dröge, Abernitzke, Frank Grimm, Sakib, Broeserl, António Pina, Darshan Mody, Sergey Agafyin, Андрей Бурмистров, Jake, GS, Lawton Shoemake, Animus24, Jozo Leko, John Breland, espkk, Wolfgang Gärtner, Louis St-Amour, Stephan Roslen, Venkat Nandam, Jose Francisco, Douglas Tinkham, Kuchlong Kuchlong, Avi Kohn, Robert Blanch, Truels Wissneth, Kris Kafka, Mario Luoni, Neil Wang, Friedrich Huber, Sudhakar Balagurusamy, lennonli, and Pramod Tikare Muralidhara.\nThanks in particular to Jon Hess, Lakshman, Christian Wittenhorst, Sherhy Pyton, and Dendi Suhubdy\nI'm happy to give online-seminars or face-to-face seminars world-wide.

75	How do the rules about path obstruction differ between Scotland and other parts of Britain for landowners?	In England and Wales, landowners must actively maintain paths, including providing and maintaining stiles and gates, keeping them safe and useable, and cutting vegetation to specific widths (3m for bridleways and 1.5m for footpaths). In Scotland, landowners have no requirement to maintain paths, but they must not obstruct them and have a duty of care to people on their land. They must also respect access rights by not hindering people and work with local authorities to integrate access and land management.	"['Scotland gained what many call its ""Right to Roam"" legislation with the passing by the Scottish Parliament of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. This gives statutory access rights to most land and inland water in Scotland. The rights under the Act must be exercised responsibly by respecting people\'s safety, privacy and livelihoods; and with regard to Scotland\'s environment.\nThe Scottish Government agency, Scottish National Heritage, has set up the excellent Outdoor Access Scotland Website This gives detailed advice for everyone involved in Outdoor Access, whether as countryside users, recreation managers, or land managers. It includes advice on an activity by activity basis, and makes available as a pdf file the 136 page Scottish Outdoor Access Code.\nYou can think of this as an outdoors equivalent to the ""Highway Code"". It is based on the underlying legislation and has been approved by Scottish Ministers and Parliament, and while it is not itself legally enforceable, it is taken as a reference point for deciding if those involved in any dispute about access have acted responsibly. Ignore it and you could find yourself in trouble. The rest of this page highlights the key features in the Outdoor Access Code, but if you are planning unusual activities we\'d recommend you look at the much more detailed guidance on the\nEveryone, irrespective of age or ability, has access rights, but they only apply if exercised responsibly. Access rights apply to hills, mountains and moorland; woods and forests; most urban and country parks and other managed open spaces; rivers, lochs, canals and reservoirs; riverbanks, loch shores, beaches and coastline; land in which crops have not been sown; on the margins of fields where crops are growing or have been sown; grassland, including grass being grown as a crop if it is below about 8 inches or 20cm in height; fields containing horses, cattle or other farm animals; local authority designated core paths, and other paths crossing land to which access rights apply; grass sports or playing fields so long as they are not in use, and inland water used for recreational purposes, so long as those recreational purposes are not interfered with; golf courses (excluding greens), but only to cross them, and only if games of golf are not interfered with; and, finally (and here we quote the code) ""on, through or over bridges, tunnels, causeways, launching sites, groynes, weirs, boulder weirs, embankments of canals and similar waterways, fences, walls or anything designed to facilitate access (such as gates or stiles)"".\nAccess rights can be exercised on the land, or above or below it (i.e. in the air or in caves). They also apply at any time of day or night. However, the Code highlights the particular care that must be taken if exercising access rights at night to avoid causing concern to residents or livestock.\nAll these access rights come with responsibilities. The first is to act with ""courtesy, consideration and awareness"", taking care to respect the interests of other people living, working, or enjoying the area in question. The second is to care for the environment, leaving the land as you find it and avoiding damage to gates, walls etc. The third is to take responsibility for your own actions: to act with care for your own safety and the safety of others in the knowledge that the outdoors is not a risk-free environment.\nAccess rights include access for recreational purposes, some educational purposes, and some commercial activities. Recreational purposes are not legally defined, but can be taken to include pastimes such as painting, sightseeing and photography; social activities like picnics, playing, paddling, sledging, flying a kite or walking the dog; active pursuits such as walking, cycling, horse riding, climbing, orienteering, skiing, caving, canoeing, swimming, sailing, diving, above ground sports and wild camping; and participation in organised events involving recreational activities.\nEducational activities are included within access rights where they are intended to further someone\'s understanding of natural or cultural heritage: e.g. an educational visit to look at geology, wildlife, landscape or flora and fauna. Commercial activities are included within access rights where they involve an activity that could be carried out under access rights on a non-commercial basis. Permitted commercial activities would include mountain guides taking clients up a mountain; a professional canoe or sailing instructor with a group of students; or a professional writer or photographer taking notes about, or photographs of, the natural or cultural heritage.\nSo far, this has been very much a catalogue of things you can do. It helps greatly if those intending to visit Scotland\'s outdoors also understand the limitations, both in terms of areas excluded from access rights and activities not included within access rights.\nAccess rights do not apply to land on which there is a house, caravan or tent which gives its occupants privacy or shelter plus enough of the surrounding area to ensure that occupants\' privacy and enjoyment is not unreasonably disturbed; gardens set aside for the enjoyment of residents of a specific area (especially in the larger cities); land containing a building, works, plant or machinery, plus any enclosed surrounding area or compound, such as a farmyard, oil refinery, military base, sports centre, fish farm, or animal pen; land in which crops are growing or have been sown; grass sports pitches when in use; artificial sports pitches; golf greens, cricket squares, bowling greens, tennis courts and the like; school grounds and playing fields; visitor attractions where an admission charge is made; building or demolition sites; railways or airports; quarries; or land excluded from access rights by specific by-laws.\nAccess rights do not extend to any activity that would normally be unlawful or criminal; or to hunting, shooting and fishing; to motorised activities such as motorcycling, off-road driving, flying microlights, operating powered watercraft and powered models (though access rights do apply to people with a disability using a vehicle or vessel adapted for their use); to being responsible for a dog not under proper control (and ""proper control"" is defined in detail in the access code); or to access for the purpose of taking away for commercial use anything in or on the land or water (berries, mushrooms, gravel etc.).\nExisting public rights of way (including existing vehicular rights of way) were unaffected by the 2003 legislation and continued to exist, as did public rights on the foreshore and in tidal waters.', 'The majority of farms have some form of public right of way across them, whether it is a footpath, bridleway or byway. But when walkers are heading for your crops, what are your rights and responsibilities?\nWe look into the rules of farming near footpaths for landowners and arable farmers.\nWho looks after public rights of way?\nIn England and Wales, responsibility for maintaining footpaths, bridleways and byways are divided between the landowner and the highways authority. Parish and town councils also have certain discretionary powers.\nThe situation is different in Scotland, as there is no definitive list of rights of way (although a list of “core paths” does exist) and access rights are different under the Land Reform Act. Nobody has a duty to maintain a right of way, although local authorities have powers to do so.\nIn Scotland you must respect access rights by not hindering or deterring people, act reasonably when asking people to avoid the area when land management operations are taking place, and work with local authorities to integrate access and land management.\nWhat do farmers/landowners have to do?\n- Farmers or landowners are required to keep rights of way open and useable; this includes providing and maintaining stiles and gates and making sure they are safe and easy to use.\n- Cut vegetation that could obstruct the route (at least 3m is required for bridleways and 1.5m for footpaths unless they are crossing a field – see below).\n- Paths that run on the field edge must not be cultivated and cross-field paths must be reinstated correctly after field operations.\n- Landowners must meet all their legal obligations regarding maintenance of public rights of way to claim Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) payments under cross-compliance.\nIn Scotland, landowners aren’t required to maintain a right of way, but they must not obstruct it and have a duty of care to people on their land.\nThe “right to responsible access” means people aren’t necessarily restricted to paths and can walk across uncropped fields where no path exists. However, such access rights are suspended as soon as a crop is sown until after harvest and walkers must keep to the field edge during this time.\nWho keeps the path surface clear?\nIt is down to the landowner to keep cross-field paths clear from crops other than hay or silage.\nIn England and Wales, the highways authority is responsible for maintaining the surface of public rights of way and controlling surface vegetation (other than crops).\nIt is also responsible for steps, handrails, some barriers, drains, most bridges and culverts, stepping stones, fords, signposts and waymarks.\nNo one body or organisation is responsible for path surfaces in Scotland, although users have a common law right to keep routes clear of vegetation.\nFarmers should use common sense to ensure core cross-field paths are walkable.\nCan I plough or cultivate a cross-field path?\nYes, you can disturb a path surface when ploughing or cultivating the field, but if you do, you must reinstate a good path surface within 14 days of the first disturbance if a crop is being sown, or within 24 hours in other cases.\nThe surface must be returned to at least the minimum width, which is 1n for cross-field footpaths and 2m for bridleways. Signs should be used to show the route of any reinstated path. If the path runs along the field boundary, it is illegal to plough it up or cultivate it.\nIn Scotland, core paths across farmland must be reinstated within 14 days, although there is no specified width, other than to return it to the same as before.\nCan field-edge paths be cultivated?\nNo. A crop – other than grass – must be prevented from making the path difficult to find or follow.\nThe public has the right to walk though crops growing on or over the path and they can also report it to the highway authorities, which have the power to prosecute or cut the crop and send the bill to the landowner.\nFarmers in Scotland are advised to use common sense when cultivating fields to ensure people can exercise their right to walk around field boundaries if they choose to.\nWhat if I use a contractor?\nWhere a contractor is employed to do work, the occupier is liable – irrespective of any contract terms – for any failure to restore cross-field paths or cultivation of field-edge rights of way.\nCan I spray over a cross-field path?\nUsually yes. But look at the product’s label for conditions. Some products require people and livestock to be kept out of the treated area for a period of time – do not use these if you cannot restrict access to the area.\nFor paths running alongside the field, care should be taken to make sure the public are not at risk. Consider using notices to advise people that pesticides are being applied and to ask them to keep themselves, children or pets to the path or access area.\nHowever, you must not put up a notice that might stop people going onto the right of way or an area they have a right to use.\nContact the highways authority for advice – as you need their permission to put a notice on a right of way. It would be advisable to explain on the notice what the pesticide is and what it does, without using too much technical terminology that may not be understood.\nSuch notices cannot stop people using a public right of way and if people are still using it despite the warning notices operators should consider stopping operations briefly if there is a risk to health such as from the machinery or spray used.\nWho to tell if there is an incident involving pesticides\nIf there is an incident involving people and pesticides then you should inform your nearest Health and Safety Executive (HSE) office. The HSE information line is 0845 345 0055 – they should be able to tell you the number of your nearest office. For emergencies out of hours call 0151 922 9235.\nDo field-edge paths count towards watercourse protection zones?\nPublic rights of way may form part of the 1-2m protection zone along hedges and watercourses. When they do, the GAEC 1 – establishment of buffer strips along watercourses – rules apply.\nCan I get a footpath moved or changed?\nPotentially, yes. Apply to your local highways authority if you think a route should be changed. You can also apply to get one closed or temporarily diverted for a specific reason.\nWhat if I block a path?\nObstructing a public right of way is a criminal offence. Avoid obstructions on or across the route – for example, electric fences, walls, hedgerows, padlocked gates and barbed wire. Also make sure no vegetation encroaches on the route from the sides or above.\n- For more information speak to your local council rights of way office.

It can connect to strain gauges, DIC cameras, and other sensors to record detailed strain mapping across complex test components' surfaces, allowing for quick and easy collection of comprehensive test data.	['Siemens have taken data from a test campaign carried out on an ElectroPuls E10000 fatigue testing machine, which is optimized for fatigue testing on Additively manufactured products. The data was then used to assess the challenges associated with AM for metal alloys and offer a solution to some of these challenges with Siemens Digital Industries Software.\nThe fatigue performance of a metallic component is determined by the features within the microstructure of the material and the geometry of the specimen. As with any manufacturing technique, the components produced through AM will contain features inherent to the process. These could come in the form of residual stresses, porosities or differences in surface roughness, and their presence will be highly dependent on the local geometry of the component, as depicted in Figure 1. This means the resulting relationship between the component and the microstructural features that will dictate its fatigue performance, becomes highly complex. Mathematical illustration of the interaction between features, as well as each feature’s individual impact is therefore impossible.\nFigure 1 Factors affecting the fatigue life of a 3D-Printed structure.\nFor manufacturers producing performance critical components in Industry, the challenge of investigating fatigue characteristics will typically result in a heavy reliance on prototype testing and highly extensive testing campaigns at huge expense. This is due to a lack of Computer-aided Engineering (CAE) tools that can predict how dynamic performance differs depending on the array and combination of features found locally within each component.\nSurface roughness is a clear example of how local features can differentiate in 3D-printed components, due to them being built up by overhanging subsequent layers of material by a small amount, as shown by the differing distributions in Figure 2. Manufacturers must therefore print and test parts in as many orientations as possible, in order to determine which produces the best fatigue characteristics.\nFigure 2 Surface roughness as a function of overhang angle for differing build orientations, shown in Simcenter 3D.\nIt is not feasible to test all build orientations or assess all the combinations of microstructural features – not to mention the effects of loading conditions, residual stresses and post treatments. Nonetheless, for 3D-pirinted parts to be used in safety critical scenarios, these effects must be reliably predicted.\nThrough the power of machine learning, Siemens Digital Industries Software can assess the fatigue performance on 3D-Printed components that have not been mechanically tested. The methodology has been evaluated on specimens printed by 3D Systems according to a fixed set of processing parameters, for which the fatigue testing and analysis was performed by the Additive Manufacturing team of the Mechanical Engineering Department at KU Leuven , using an Instron® ElectroPuls E10000.\nWith its integrated T-slot table, the ElectroPuls E10000 from Instron is optimized for fatigue testing on Additively manufactured products. The all-electric nature paired with user-friendly WaveMatrix™2 software, as well as features such as patented Stiffness Based Tuning, culminate into a versatile and highly effective system for testing over a small footprint. Simple connectivity to strain gauges, DIC cameras and a host of other sensors, allow users to record detailed strain mapping across the surface of complex test components. As a result, producing a detailed data set for your test campaign has never been so quick and easy.From the real-world SN data acquired by the ElectroPuls system, the software can then predict the SN curve for untested combinations of conditions.\nThe machine learning uses a Gaussian Process Regression - a method that effectively provides a probability distribution for outcomes based on a minimal set of input data and offers advantages over classical approaches that utilize interpolation or extrapolation.\nAfter incorporating the machine learning into the Siemens Simcenter 3D Specialist Durability software, fatigue properties can be defined by region or element and can include additional treatments to the material. From the CAD model, the system will then identify fatigue affecting features in the component and the Machine Learning Algorithm can then predict local SN curves corresponding to different surface elements in the model. A durability calculation can then quantify the damage accumulation for the entire structure based on its local features using the material properties and mapping of SN curves across the model to produce a simulation as shown schematically in Figure 3.\nFigure 3 Depiction of workflow to determine durability computations using machine learning extension for 3D-printed parts.\nThe results in Figure 4 below, show the predicted fatigue behavior for three different samples. In each instance, the actual test data for each sample (represented by the blue data points), was not inputted into the machine learning algorithm. You can see from the graphs that the algorithm has successfully predicted the behavior of the samples, with all points sitting within the upper and lower bounds of the prediction and close to the predicted SN curve (solid red line). The samples shown include: a build orientated at 90 degrees, with subsequent machining and Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) treatment and two builds orientated at 50 degrees, one that received a Full Annealing (FA) treatment and the other HIP treatment.\nFigure 4 Results of fatigue life prediction for 3D-printed parts closely matching real experimental data points.\nThis machine learning approach from Siemens looks to be a successful method for characterizing the fatigue properties of components made through additive manufacturing techniques and offers a solution that does not require specific inference of fatigue affecting factors. The method is also flexible enough to cater for local phenomena in the sample. Finally, for additive manufacturing facilities that likely have a limited number of knowledgeable individuals but a high demand for testing, the capability of the machine learning approach from Siemens, paired with the testing efficiency of the ElectroPuls E10000, results in a huge reduction in time and the number of tests required to achieve a wide variety of results.\nIf you want to read Siemens’ original article, it can be found here.']	['<urn:uuid:0f7490b5-421e-47f0-960f-dbf69c79d2b5>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	12	59	977
77	What makes picnic food preparation timing crucial and how should cross-contamination be prevented?	Picnic food preparation timing is crucial - food should be prepared no earlier than the day before to minimize bacterial growth. For prevention of cross-contamination, ready-to-eat foods must be kept separate from items that need cooking while traveling, with each item individually wrapped and packed in different containers to prevent spills. When grilling, separate plates and utensils must be designated for raw and cooked foods to avoid cross-contamination. Additionally, proper cooking temperatures must be maintained - beef and sausage should reach 160 degrees, while chicken and turkey need 165 degrees, held for 3 minutes.	"[""Whether surrounded by family and friends, planning a romantic getaway, or creating a solo escape, the perfect picnic is possible. With planning and preparation, you can master the perfect picnic for a flawless, stress-free afternoon.\nThe Perfect Spot\nWhen Mother Nature throws a curveball, darkening sunny skies, don't let this put a damper on your plans. Re-invent picnic spots by looking close to home. The perfect picnic may turn out to be on the back porch. If weather is more favorable, choose a spot that keeps comfort in mind. An entire day spent in the sun may seem inviting, but all those hours in the heat will exhaust energy and spoil food. Seek out leafy locations where you can find relief in the shade when you need it.\nYour Picnic Basket\nYour perfect picnic may be a formal event for a large number of guests, or an intimate party for two on a cozy quilt. Whether large-scale or small, creating a picnic basket checklist helps keep you organized.\nIn Your Basket:\n- Plates, spoons etc\n- C serving utensils\n- cups and glasses\n- bottle openers\n- cutting board and cutting knife\n- insect repellant\n- moist towels\n- trash bags\n1. Be Colourful\nKeep your picnic healthy by stocking up on colourful vegetables. Crunchy carrots, celery, and cucumbers are ideal--they're a no fuss appetizer, packed with nutrition. Dress veggies with low-fat yogurt dips, or salsa.\n2. Switch Dips\nPlan a healthy retreat by swapping traditional sides for nutritious, home-made alternatives. Trade mayo for this zesty garnish: mix plain low-fat yogurt with a tablespoon of Dijon or whole grain mustard. Perfect as a sandwich spread, a veggie dip, or a tasty salad dressing.\n3. Banish Boredom\nBuild on classic staples for a fresh menu.\n- Transform chunks of day-old bread into a colourful appetizer when combined with chopped tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, and a sprinkling of fresh basil. Drizzle with olive oil for a light and fresh summer dish.\n- Peel and grate beets for a refreshing beet salad topped with crunchy pistachios or hazelnuts.\n4. Drink Up\nFreshen up your picnic with a pitcher of home-made lemonade.\nPerfect Picnic Lemonade\n- 1 cup sugar\n- 1 cup hot water\n- 2 cups fresh lemon juice\n- 1 gallon cold water\n- 1 lemon, sliced\n- mint sprigs (garnish)\n- Stir sugar and hot water in a large container until sugar dissolves.\n- Add lemon juice and cold water and stir.\n- Pour into glasses, squeeze lemon slice over each. Add garnish.\n5. Reinvent a Classic: Potato Salad\nKeep the salad, hold the mayo. Reinvent an old favorite by swapping this mayo-based salad, which is high in fat, for a low-fat variation.\n- 4 potatoes\n- 1/2 yellow onion, chopped\n- 3/4 cup hummus\n- 1/2 cup plain, fat-free Greek yogurt\n- 3 celery sticks, chopped\n- 1/4 cup fresh dill, chopped\n- salt and pepper\n- a dash of paprika\n- ground cayenne to taste\nBoil and drain potatoes. Combine in a large bowl with the other ingredients, mixing well.(Serves 4).\nAfter all that planning and hard work, you don't want to see your efforts go to waste, literally. To keep your picnic safe, keep these tips in mind:\n- Wait till the last minute. Procrastination may be a shortcoming in other circumstances, but when it comes to preparing picnic food, hold off until at least the day before. Food cooked too far in advance gives bacteria a better chance to grow.\n- Separate hot and cold food. To keep your food safe from bacteria, store hot and cold foods separately and never let them sit at unsafe temperatures for more than two hours.\n- Pack cold foods in a cooler--within a thick support of ice blocks or frozen gel packs--at 4?C or below. During the drive, keep coolers in the backseat instead of the trunk, where temperatures can get too steamy.\n- Wrap hot foods inside a blanket or insulated cover, stored at 60?C or above.\n- Non-refrigerated options. sandwiches, nuts, and unpeeled fresh fruit, like bananas and oranges, bypass the hot-cold issue altogether.\n- Hand health. If you won't be near a sink to wash your hands, pack moist towels to ward off bacteria.\n- Keep insects away. Cover foods to prevent uninvited guests from getting into the food before you can and infecting it with harmful bacteria.\n- Leave leftovers. If food has been sitting out for too long at an unsafe temperature, it's best to toss it. Too many hands have touched it and too much time has passed to risk keeping it."", 'By Cristina Pessegueiro, Skinny Gene Nutritionist\nSummer is here and so is the season of picnics, pool parties, and barbeques! While enjoying the outdoors with friends and family allows for spending quality time together, it also means cooking lots of tasty dishes to be shared. Unfortunately these events can be bacteria’s dream come true. 1 in 6 Americans suffer from food poisoning each year. In the summer months, those numbers escalate.\nHave a food safe summer by remembering these four basic food safety rules. You’ll keep your friends and family safe, from the food prep down to bringing home delicious leftovers.\n4 FOOD SAFETY RULES YOU SHOULD KNOW\nRule #1: Clean\n- Food safety starts with the at home preparation and that means freshly washed hands and a clean kitchen. Wash all surfaces, utensils, and cutting boards with warm soapy water for at least 20 seconds. This includes before each use of your grill too!\n- Wash all fruits and veggies under running water before you peel, cut, or cook them.\n- Have clean utensils for everyone to eat with and to serve the food at your summer of fun destination.\n- Keep hand sanitizer and towelettes handy for everyone at your outdoor festivity and paper towels (not a rag to hoard bacteria) for the grill master.\nRule #2: Separate\n- Prevent any cross-contamination by keeping ready-to-eat foods or already prepared dishes separate from any that still need to be cooked while traveling. Separate by keeping each individually wrapped and packed in different larger bags or containers to prevent any spills.\n- Designate plates and utensils that will be used for raw food and keep those from touching any cooked foods.\nRule #3: Cook\n- Completely thaw meat before cooking to ensure even cooking. Use the fridge for a slower method or the microwave if it will be cooked immediately.\n- If using a marinade prior to grilling, do so in the fridge for up to two days for flavorful and tender meats.\n- Cooking outside can be a treat for all, as long as you have the right tool. Keeping a food thermometer on deck is the only real way of knowing your food has been properly cooked the whole way through. Not even the good ole visual method will do. Cook beef and sausage to 160 degrees and chicken and turkey to 165 degrees. Hold those temps for 3 minutes and measure in the thickest part of the meat.\nRule #4: Chill\nIf you cooked at home and packed your dishes, be sure to chill foods right after cooking- this prevents foods from mingling around the danger zones.\n- Transport food directly from the fridge to the cooler just before heading out for summer fun. Once there, keep any meats chilled until it’s grilling time.\n- You’ll want to keep your dishes in a shady area and set your timer. Food shouldn’t sit out for more than two hours when outdoors and anything that needs to be kept refrigerated should be kept cold in an insulated cooler with ice packets. In this warmer weather, higher than 90 degrees, food shouldn’t sit out for longer than one hour. Keep an extra close eye on anything made with mayo or dairy.\n- While you want to keep your cold foods cold, you want to keep your hot foods hot – preferably near the grill.\n- Pack up leftovers in shallow containers and refrigerate as soon as possible.\nFor more information check out foodsafety.gov and homefoodsafety.gov.

The Advanced Metal Casting Centre is a 1500m² facility equipped with multiple casting technologies including: a 1600 ton locking force high pressure die caster for aluminium and magnesium alloys, a 240kN closing force low pressure die caster, a pilot scale hot-top direct chill caster for two metre long billets, a 16 MN direct extrusion press, a scaled-up twin roll caster with novel melt conditioning technology, and high resolution real-time X-ray inspection.	['Opens its Advanced Metal Casting Centre.\nScientists at Brunel University (London) perfected a patented niobium-based master alloy that filled the missing gap in grain refiners for magnesium alloys and offered significant advantages over titanium in aluminium silicon alloys.\nLed by Dr Hari Babu Nadendla of the Brunel Centre for Advanced Solidification Science (BCAST), the team’s discovery of a patented niobium based master alloy has won the Institute of Materials Charles Hatchett Prize and Medal and the Cast Metal Foundation’s 2016 Innovation Award.\nThe Brunel Advanced Metal Casting Centre bridges the gap between research and industry\n“The Nb-based master alloy is shown to be effective in refining aluminium-containing magnesium alloys which are typically processed using sand or high pressure diecasting or direct-chill casting. Our research showed significant improvements in both tensile strength and ductility after using the niobium master alloy. But we were also delighted to discover that that same master alloy showed much greater grain refinement in Al-Si alloys than titanium and these are much more widely used than Mg-Al alloys,” said Dr Hari Babu Nadendla.\n“Mg-Al alloy use is currently nowhere as widespread as Al-Si but this could change quite rapidly as a result of this discovery, especially in aerospace applications. For both alloys we found the niobium grain refiner could mean an end to the over-engineering of cast components with potential weight savings of up to 30 per cent with no loss of strength or ductility. Both in the automotive and aerospace industries weight reduction is a key driver.”\n“A particularly pleasing feature is that our new master alloy opens the door to in-factory recycling of excess Al-Si melt.”\n“At the moment it is generally sent offsite for recycling because of iron contamination making it brittle and so requiring specialist treatment. If the melt is treated with our discovery, excess alloy from a pour or spills and overfills can simply be recycled back into the process.”\nDr Nadendla’s team has already trialed the master alloy in factory conditions with melts of up to six tons. But they feel they have as yet barely scraped the surface and intend to investigate further in Brunel’s new Advanced Metals Casting Centre, which aims to plug the gap between laboratory discoveries and commercial production.\nShaping the future: Casting research ramps up to industrial scale\nBrunel University has opened its Advanced Metal Casting Centre (AMCC), where innovative technologies to make automotive components lighter and completely recyclable will be tested under industry conditions.\nThe £17million, 1500m² building has been funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, Innovate UK, Constellium and Jaguar Land Rover.\nBrunel University’s casting techniques could lead to lighter and recyclable car components\nThe facility is equipped with a 1600 ton locking force high pressure die caster for aluminium and magnesium alloys, a 240kN closing force low pressure die caster, a pilot scale hot-top direct chill caster for two metre long billets up to 204mm in diameter, a 16 MN direct extrusion press with taper controlled billet heating, a scaled-up twin roll caster incorporating Brunel’s novel melt conditioning technology and high resolution real-time X-ray inspection.\nThe primary aim is to scale up from fundamental research carried out in the Brunel Centre for Advanced Solidification Techniques (BCAST) and the Liquid Metal Engineering Centre (LiME) under Professor Zhongyun Fan.']	['<urn:uuid:471afc6e-b288-44d3-a26c-d14ef6299901>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	8	71	547
79	digital health care benefits risks elderly	Digital health innovations offer potential benefits but also raise concerns. They promise more accurate diagnoses, better disease understanding, and improved treatment monitoring, which could particularly benefit aging populations requiring increased medical attention. However, these technologies also risk exacerbating inequality, as the digital divide disproportionately affects elderly individuals who may lack access to or familiarity with digital technologies, potentially limiting their ability to benefit from these healthcare advances and widening existing disparities in healthcare access.	['TRACK Digitalization of Society\nS9: Webvideos: Science communication, power and credibility\nErik STENGLER (University of the West of England), United Kingdom\nIsaac KERLOW (Earth Observatory of Singapore), Singapore\nIn previous years we have explored webvideos as a tool for science communication. Moving forward,we now focus on the reality that the proliferation of science channels on the most popular webvideo platforms is not free from concerns about influences from positions of power, such as the search engines and the platforms themselves. In a medium where views and likes are essential for content to be seen among the huge amount of materials that are uploaded every minute, the search algorithms exert an unprecedented influence on what users find and see. We will welcome contributions that address the use of webvideos in science communication in general, and especially those who will open a discussion about the influence of search algorithms on the management and content of channels, e.g. on how to circumvent or adapt to their dictates and maintain a reputation of credibility and objectivity.\nKEYWORDS: science communication, webvideos, credibility, power\nS10: Algorithmic Society: Shaping and relying on algorithms\nValentin JANDA & Matthias BOTTEL (Technische Universität Berlin), Germany\nIn digital societies algorithms are part of the everyday life and work. They match couples in online dating, maintain our filterbubbles, govern the smart city and are used to optimize ourselves with gamification and quantified self. They basically have become ubiquitous and are used to make decisions with far-reaching impact. In this session we want to address two connected crucial points: first how algorithms co-shape work, creativity and many more aspects of digital live. Second, to examine how algorithms are outcomes of social actions.\nOn one side, as any other technology, information technology comprises a certain interpretative flexibility and is therefore socially shaped by different sets of actors. We ask: Who shapes the algorithms, whose interests are being followed? Which practices and which means of inscription emerge? On the other hand we ask: How are these socially shaped algorithms adapted in the user practices? Are they re-shaped by their adaptors? To what extent do they shape the diverse actions they are involved in?\nAlgorithms and all practices incorporated with them are a promising empirical field to investigate these intertwined questions of shaping technology and the shaping via technology:\nThe algorithms beneath social media, swarms and crowds populating the internet allow new forms of organized collective action, and non-organized situated activities (Dolata and Shrape 2014). In the profession of architecture new work practices based on algorithms change the way how architects draft and even the matter what has to be drafted, as the capabilities of three dimensional renderings lead to new forms of drafting (Houdart 2008). While being implemented, algorithms may cause unexpected problems. Highly routinized work practices have to be re-organized and even more effortful re-routinized. Results are higher workloads and sophisticated problem solving which is imposed to the workers (Ortmann 2014). In other cases, the use of algorithm-based work-tools is prevented for longer periods of time as Mackay and Potthast point out for the case of flight-control (Mackay 2000, Potthast 2008).\nNot alone are the questions concerning constitution and effect intimately connected, the creation and impact of algorithms shape, change and stabilize our work, our social relations, in short many aspects of our societies. The aforementioned perspective to focus the social shaping of and by algorithms draws the focus to the following interests:\n• The differences between projected and real application and thereby the producer to user relationship\n• The implications of power regarding the technical (and thereby more reliable and steady) realization of rule systems via algorithms\n• Attempts of opening or closing the access to algorithms in consensus or confrontational ways\n• Inclusion and exclusion of knowledge (e.g. filterbubble) and participation by algorithmic decisions and coping strategies to overcome exclusion\n• Iterative negotiations between producers and users though algorithms\n• Accountability and adaption of artificial intelligence\nKEYWORDS: algorithms, social shaping of technology, digitalization, case study\nS11: Transdisciplinary approaches to technology assessment for evaluating opportunities and risks of the sharing economy enabled by digitalization\nClemens MADER & Lorenz H. HILTY (Empa, Technology and Society Lab, St.Gallen, and University of Zurich); Maria POURI (University of Zurich), Switzerland\nSharing or exchanging things of common interest has been around ever since mankind exists. What has changed over time is the scale of impact that has exponentially increased with the stepwise implementation and use of digital technologies, i.e. digitalization.\nFrom analog agreements (e.g. contracts) between people with in trusted relationships to machine-to-machine communications over the Internet, digitalization has provided people with global access to information flows that facilitate the sharing of products and services. It has moved the scale of the prevailing type of economy forward to new levels of reaching out to people to share various goods. Familiar examples are AirBnB, Uber or even Bitcoin that started using the existing small scaled sharing economy models of Couchsurfing, CarSharing and peer-to-peer economy using digital currency, respectively, and scaled them up to wider and even global use by leveraging state-of-the-art technologies in digitizing the economy.\nThe gig economy is also another type of the sharing economy that has emerged fairly recently and in the form of online on-demand work platforms for labour and job market.\nIn this session, we will firstly discuss the definition, concept and application of the sharing economy enabled by new waves of digitalization. We then will bring to light the impacts, opportunities and risks of the sharing economy within the sustainable development context. Such opportunities and risks depend hugely on motivations and the values perceived by individuals as well as “the crowd”. So, we also discuss and potentially test transdisciplinary methods of technology assessment to evaluate various opportunities and risks brought about by the latest development of digitalization as the enabler of the sharing economy through the lens of sustainable development. The need for this session on the proposed topic area is felt because of the potential of the sharing economy and its assumable impacts on development and progress for countries. Researchers are invited to propose their papers relevant to the content or method of this session (transdisciplinary methods for technology assessment). We like to create an interactive session and will get in contact with you to discuss a productive and co-creative procedure.\nKEYWORDS: algorithms, social shaping of technology, digitalization, case study\nS12: Socio-technical systems in the digitized society\nJacqueline LEMM, Alexander MERTENS, Nenja ZIESEN (RWTH Aachen University),\nRobert WEIDNER (Helmut Schmidt Universität Hamburg), Germany\nSocio-technical systems shape our society everyday. We serve vacuum cleaners, use navigation systems, older people operate the SOS button on their wrist when they fall, and older workers put their knowledge into tutorial apps that help apprentices to learn. Even in working life we are increasingly supported or assisted by different technical systems like augmented or virtual reality systems and exoskeleton in order to relief cognitive and physical stress. Architects are supported in the planning of technologies by digital planning systems that take not only the technical but also the social and ethical implications into account – tasks and interactions are changed by the use of socio-technical systems. How should socio-technical systems be designed to support and not to replace humans? What can socio-technical systems actually do against the background of societal challenges, such as demographic change or digitization?\nWhat is the technical-ethical rating for these systems? How should the interaction between humans and technology be shaped in the future? This session will focus socio-technical systems in the digitized society for different areas of life: Life, Work and on a micro-level Body. In this context, aspects like acceptance of technology, adaptability, design, interaction, usability and functionality should be especially addressed. The session addresses on the on hand interdisciplinary issues and approaches from researchers with different background, e.g.\nengineering science, sociology, psychology, computer science, movement science and medicine as well as on the other hand research and application related topics. Topics include but are not limited to:\n- Approaches for human machine interaction and integration for physical and cognitive support (e.g. life (health/age), work)\n- Interfaces between users and support systems\n- Assistance Systems with integrated industry 4.0 principles\n- Strategies for acceptance improvement\n- Relations of body and technology, interpretable body-date, knowledge stocks in context of ascertainability of the body\n- Technical, economical, ethical, gerontological and social impacts\nThe session organizers themselves work interdisciplinary in different research groups made up of researchers of the engineering sciences, of sociology, of psychology, computer science, sport science (ergonomics) and medicine.\nKEYWORDS: socio-technical systems, human machine interaction, physical and cognitive support, assistance systems, acceptance, body and technologies, ethical and social impacts, interdisciplinary\nS13: Degrowth and Digitalization\nPetra WÄCHTER (University of Vienna), Austria; Melf-Hinrich EHLERS (Kassel University), Germany; Linda NIERLING (ITAS, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology), Germany; Christian KERSCHNER (Masaryk University), Czech Republic\nThe Degrowth movement gained much popularity in recent years. Degrowth can be described as a scientific, political, and activist movement which aims to transform the society towardsmore equality, autonomy, democracy etc., but within ecological limits. The role of technology for a sustainable society without continuous economic growth is important for those who pursue Degrowth. Generally, within the Degrowth community, more enthusiastic attitudes towards technology and more sceptic views can be found. Those in favour of technology such as fab-labs or 3-D-printing clash with techno-sceptics. Some Degrowth-related communities and projects literally define themselves around particular technologies. Examples linked to digitisation are digital commons, the Fairphone community (Haucke forthcoming), the open source and hacking community (Hankammer, Kostakis, March, Likavcan & Scholz-Wäckerle, Vetter forthcoming), digital makerspaces and fab labs (March, Kostakis forthcoming).\nA central theme among more techno-enthusiastic authors is the democratization of echnology, including liberation of access to technology in terms of know-how (open source), necessary skills for production (prosumers), of use and repair, of income (affordability) and gender. Despite a widespread suggestion that ICTs could play an important role in the democratisation of technology, there is not yet a unified answer on which, how and to what extent ICTs should be supported by Degrowth advocates. The conditions in which a technology supports Degrowth principles still require deeper investigation (Haucke forthcoming). A reflective approach (Samerski forthcoming) is required, also because the socio-psychological effects of the increasing prevalence of ICTs in our lives, which Ivan Illich for example warned about, are still poorly understood. Strand et al. (forthcoming) identify a general trend in the dominant socio-technical imaginaries to place great hopes in ICT-based sustainability solutions (see also Pollex & Lenschow forthcoming) and expectations of conclusive accounts of material and energy needs and rebound effects of the “ICT revolution”. For Lange (2017) digitisation will be part of future technology. But he warns of excessive economic growth, increased inequality and material throughput and of data storage used to influence consumption. An important limitation of the suggested ICT revolution is that unlike “epoch-making inventions” many of the latest ICT applications “eat” human time rather than saving it for other purposes (e.g. smartphones and social media) (Bonaiuti forthcoming). This contradicts the accelerationists (Snircek and Wilson 2015), who argue that capitalism’s future technology can release time that can be used for democratic activities to overcome capitalism.\nThis special session will draw together empirical and theoretical work that addresses the question of whether certain digital technologies or ICT in general could support a Degrowth Society. Descriptions of practical attempts to match digital technology with Degrowth are also welcome. Contributions can be from any disciplinary background and on any digital technology and Degrowth concern. The aim is to convene a special session based on the format of the knowledge café, within which diverse perspectives can be elaborated and evaluated jointly by the contributors and an actively engaged audience.\nKEYWORDS: digitalization, Degrowth, technology, democracy, autonomy\nS14: Information infrastructures and the digitalization of science: Perspectives of STS, TA and cultural studies\nDirk HOMMRICH (openTA, KIT-ITAS), Germany\nAs socio-technical arrangements, specialized information services and scholarly social (or “academic”) online networks share similarities, two main features of such internet-based offerings are: 1) a specialization in one (or more) academic discipline(s) and a corresponding (inter-)disciplinary community; 2) multimodality and the integration of diverse functions. This is why we don’t include single-purpose services like “simple websites” (e.g. of an expert association), library catalogs, repositories, digital document delivery, blogs, mailing lists etc. as specialized information services or scholarly social online networks which rather manage diverse functions. But which kind of functions and socio-technical relations are we talking about and what kind of broader (e.g. institutional, political, economic, legal and social) contexts define the environment in which those information services are embedded?\nOn a fundamental level we might distinguish between information (messages, announcements, events calendar, new book releases), communication (two- or multi-sided correspondence, e.g. mailing lists, blogs, discussion groups), cooperation (multi-sided interaction, collaborative coordination, collective writing in the “cloud”, distributed analysis of data) and transaction (binding communicative action, e.g. the order of a publication, signing a research proposal).\nFollowing a (stereo)typical scholarly workflow you would start by searching for publications, data, projects, partners, sponsors. Once a research project is funded you create your own publications and research data which are to be shared within a specialized (scientific) community. Workshops (and virtual seminars or streaming solutions) are also part of this research episode. It might also be useful to offer research tools, e.g. online questionnaires and survey systems or shared libraries in the humanities and the social sciences. Outcomes would have to be discussed, evaluated, improved and reviewed. But we might also distinguish between actors and addressed audience. Do recipients have the opportunity to contribute or do they have to remain passive, how about the figure of the “prosumer” to describe the hybrid role actors can assume in such e-infrastructures of scholarly communication that incorporate user-generated content (e.g. in blogs and internet forums)?\nGeneric questions that could be addressed:\nWhich kind of approaches form Cultural Studies, TA and STS deliver which type of tools to analyze these kinds of internet platforms?\nAre there any results of evaluations regarding scientific information systems, specialized information services, scholarly networks? Are there typologies for these systems?\nWhich resources and requirements exist for their development and maintenance? What are the financial and business models of such services?

81	software enthusiast seeking no cost photo manipulation tools equivalent experience adobe products	GIMP is an excellent free, open-source alternative to Photoshop. It features a large library of plugins that can replicate many popular Photoshop features. While it has a complex interface that might be challenging for beginners, GIMP allows skilled users to achieve impressive results. It also has a large community of users providing support through forums and tutorial videos.	['- It’s easy to create professional-looking photos with today’s photo editors.\n- Free editors, such as GIMP, have similar features to Photoshop.\n- Android and iOS apps let you edit photos on the go.\nPhoto editing apps have come a long way since the early days of Photoshop. Today’s apps are easier to use, more powerful and more affordable. If you want to make use of Adobe’s fancy filters and plugins, you still need to get a Creative Cloud subscription. However, many plugins are cross-compatible with other programs, and you can replicate a lot of Photoshop’s best looks with other, more affordable programs. Read on for a list of some of the best free and premium photo editing programs that home users and professional photographers can utilize to create stunning images quickly and easily.\nThere’s No Need to Pay a Fortune for Photo Editing Software\nOne common misconception is that if you want to do professional photo editing, you need to spend a lot of money. This may have been the case in the past, but today you can pick up free or affordable graphic design and photo editing apps that offer professional features. Sites such as AlternativeTo can help you find open-source alternatives to the most popular big-name software packages.\nTop 10 Photo Editing Programs\nThe best photo editing program depends on your current skill level, the hardware you’re running it on and your photo editing goals. Premium tools, such as Photoshop and Lightroom, are powerful, but if all you want to do is spruce up some images for social media, you can get by with PiZap or Canva. These tools run well even on older hardware and give you access to some impressive photo editing features in their free tiers.\n1. Adobe Photoshop\nBest for: Graphic Designers\nPrice: Monthly Fee (from INR 1,655.60)\nPhotoshop is probably the best-known image editing program, and it’s been an industry leader for a long time. Today, you can purchase a monthly subscription to the Adobe Creative Cloud to get access to Photoshop and other tools in the Adobe suite. Photoshop is a powerful program that’s ideal for editing layered images and doing detailed graphic design work. However, it has a much steeper learning curve than its current rivals.\nBest for: Those looking for a free alternative to Photoshop\nGIMP is a free, open-source alternative to Photoshop. It has a large library of plugins that replicate many of the most popular Photoshop features, and skilled users can achieve impressive results with it. As with Photoshop, however, GIMP is a complex program, and it can be confusing for newcomers. There’s a large community of users, however, so it’s relatively easy to find help, either in the form of forums or tutorial videos that explain the program’s quirks.\n3. Adobe Lightroom\nBest for: Managing large photo libraries\nPrice: Monthly Fee (from INR 797.68)\nLightroom is Adobe’s dedicated photo editing solution. Because it’s designed purely for photos, it has a more streamlined interface than Photoshop. Lightroom makes it easy to touch up, crop and edit photos. It includes a useful tool for managing media libraries and has some quick and easy features for color correction, blurring, sharpening and other frequently used effects. Adobe offers an affordable Lightroom + Photoshop subscription package, too.\n4. Skylum Luminar AI\nBest for: Versatile photo editor and organizer\nPrice: Tiered pricing\nSkylum Luminar AI is an easy-to-use, affordable package that sits somewhere between Lightroom and Photoshop in terms of features. It offers a wide choice of preset workspaces for editing various types of photos. One thing that sets Luminar AI apart from many of the other premium packages on this list is the pricing. While the program costs money, it’s a one-time fee for ownership rather than a monthly subscription. If you expect to do a lot of heavy-duty photo editing, this may be an attractive way of buying your software.\nBest for: Social media enthusiasts\nPrice: Free tier available\nCanva is available as an app for Android and iOS plus as a browser-based tool. It’s an incredibly easy-to-use package for graphic design and basic photo editing. It’s aimed at people who want to make eye-catching banners or fun social media posts, offering drag-and-drop options for adding stickers, captions and frames to images. Canva doesn’t replace dedicated desktop apps for serious photo editing, but if you just want to put a sepia effect on a fancy dress photo, it’s more than up to the job.\nBest for: Plugin support and familiar Windows interface\nPaint.NET was originally designed to be an upgraded version of Microsoft Paint, but it’s grown to become so much more than that. Paint.NET now offers plugin support and sophisticated photo editing options. It’s definitely up to the task of casual photo editing. The interface is a little dated, and the program doesn’t have a Linux or MacOS version. However, it remains popular with Windows users thanks to its familiar interface and its generally reliable and stable performance.\n7. DxO Photolab\nBest for: RAW support and flexible export features\nPrice: Approximately INR 20,000\nDxO Photolab is a relatively new entry into the list of alternative photo editors. It features RAW support and allows you to save files in a wide variety of formats. DxO Photolab has a lot of options for colour correction, filters and customisable profiles to save you time and help you get consistent results. This package is available for both Mac and Windows users. A native Linux version isn’t available at this time, but the Windows version likely runs well enough under WINE.\n8. Corel PaintShop Pro\nBest for: Touch-ready for tablet PC use\nPrice: Tiered pricing available\nHistorically, Corel packages were considered a “cheap alternative” to professional graphic design packages, but that’s no longer the case. PaintShop Pro now offers a great user experience with its touch-friendly interface and easy-to-use options for effects and filters. The package even offers interactive tutorials to help would-be photo editors come to grips with some of the more powerful features. A 30-day trial and regular discounts are available.\n9. Adobe Photoshop Express Editor\nBest for: Photo editing on the go\nPrice: Free tier available\nThe Photoshop Express Editor is a browser-based version of Photoshop Express. Mobile app versions of the tool are also available. This free editor boasts an impressive list of filters and tools. However, it’s not suited for professional photo editing because you’re limited to saving your photos in JPG format. If you’re just hoping to touch up a photo to post on a blog or website, however, it’s a great solution.\nBest for: Browser-based editing on the fly\nPrice: Free tier available\nPiZap is a free, online photo editor designed to let you edit photos and share them on social media with just a few clicks. It features built-in integration with Google Drive, Dropbox and several social media sites, so you can upload a photo, make changes, then save or share it all from within your browser. The free version is surprisingly flexible. High-quality file exports, however, require you to pay for the premium package.']	['<urn:uuid:b4bb1893-79eb-4273-8c57-3f603caeb2de>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	12	58	1179
82	Which needs sealing: unfinished brick or glazed ceramic?	Unfinished brick tiles require sealing with a penetrating sealer for protection and easy cleaning. In contrast, glazed ceramic tiles do not need sealing since they are already coated with liquid glass that is baked into the surface, making them stain-proof. However, in both cases, the grout joints between tiles need to be sealed unless epoxy grout is used.	['At Inglenook Tile, some of the most dramatic installations of our brick tiles have been on walls, ceilings and chimney boxes. Brick tile can be installed on all of these surfaces without needing to pour concrete footers or otherwise add extra support, one of the major advantages of brick tile over full-sized brick.\nInstalling brick tile vertically, however, can pose a conceptual challenge to many customers– how exactly do you install it? How does the surface need to be prepped? Are there differences between indoor and outdoor installations? How does the installation process change if the tile is being laid over wood-framed walls, cement block, or drywall?\nTo help answer some of these questions, we turned to Jim Glessner, a very knowledgeable installer who has laid numerous Inglenook Tile projects. These directions and tips apply to our brick tiles as well as any other unglazed tiles that you might use on a vertical surface.\nDirections: Installing Brick Tile on a Vertical Surface\n- Prepare surface by screwing backerboard firmly into the wall studs, if this step is necessary for your surface. Cover the entire wall area that you intend to tile with backerboard.\n- Jim emphasizes the importance of taking the time to lay out your tiles properly before you begin to install. Take careful measurements and lay out your tiles, keeping 1/4″ grout lines in mind. You might want to draw out the final lines on the wall.\n- Pay special attention to the final, highest row when laying out the tiles. You don’t want to be left cutting a small sliver of tile for the final row at the ceiling– it ruins the illusion of full-brick. If the final row lays out as a less than the full tile height, split the difference between the first, lowest row and the last, highest row. This way, you will have the appearance of full-sized brick for the entire wall.\n- If you are installing with corner pieces, as for a chimney, horizontal layout is also crucial to avoid cutting a much shorter tile piece immediately before the corner piece. As with the vertical wall layout, plan ahead and spread out the cutting between two or more tiles so that they are all a similar size.\n- Once you have laid out the wall installation, install the tiles using standard mastic and 1/4″ spacers. Start at the bottom and work your way up, row-by-row. Be very careful to keep the rows plumb as you install tiles across the wall area.\n- For small wall areas, you may choose to use speedset thinset instead of standard mastic or thinset. You will need to work quickly if you choose to use speedset.\n- Allow 12-16 hours for the mastic to cure for standard mastic; 4 hours for speedset thinset.\n- After the mastic has cured, pull out the spacers and prepare your grout or mortar.\n- Jim recommends mixing mortar in a bucket with a 1/2 inch mixing drill\n- The mortar should be a thick liquid consistency, much thinner than the mortar used to install tiles on floors. You should be able to scoop up mortar and pour it into joints with a trowel.\n- Grout in-between the tiles and strike the joints. Jim strikes the vertical joints first and then the horizontal ones.\n- Allow 24 hours for the mortar to dry.\n- Seal the tiles and mortar with a penetrating sealer of your choice to allow easy cleaning and protection from water.\nInstalling Over Drywall\nFor installing brick tile over existing drywall walls, Jim tells us that you have two options depending on whether or not you want to remove and re-install your trim or wainscoting.\nOption 1: Lay tiles directly on drywall\nThe first option is to leave the trim in place and install the tiles directly over the drywall. Our brick tile and most other tile is thin enough to lay flush against standard trim without an unusual transition from the trim to tile. This option has the disadvantage of being less resilient. For instance, as Jim explains, if the wall were to have a hard impact, such as a 2-by-4 hitting wall with some force, the tiles would go through the drywall. If you choose this option, start at step 2 in the above directions and then follow as given.\nOption 2: Lay tiles on backerboard over drywall\nInstalling the tiles over backerboard makes the wall more resilient to impact, but requires the removal of all trim from the wall area before installation. You then screw backerboard through the drywall, making sure to hit studs. You might wish to glue up the backerboard and then screw it in. Follow the remaining directions as given above. After sealing the tiles and allowing them to dry, reinstall the trim over the tile wall.\nInstalling Over Wood-framed Walls (New Construction)\nFor new construction, you generally will be starting your installation project with a wood-framed wall. Installing over a framed wall simply requires screwing the backerboard into the wall studs, exactly as the above directions detail.\nInstalling Over Concrete Block\nConcrete block is simplest surface over which to install brick tile. You can stick the tiles directly to the concrete block with mastic or thinset. Skip to Step 2 above and follow the directions as given.\nInterior vs. Exterior Wall Installations\nThe technique is the same whether you install tiles indoors or outdoors, but the products you use will be slightly different.\n- When installing exterior walls or chimneys, Jim recommends laying tiles with mastic that has a much higher portland cement content. This type of mastic is more expensive but is much more pliable, allowing the tiles to move with the movement of the building once installed.\n- Make sure to seal exterior tiles to protect against rain. Use a sealer designed for exterior use.\n- Only use tiles that have been tested for freeze-thaw resilience if living in an area with cold winters. Inglenook brick tiles have been successfully tested for freeze-thaw resistance by the Tile Council of America.\nNot interested in installing yourself and live in central Pennsylvania? Jim can be contacted at 717.672.1987.', 'Porcelain tile Care and maintenance\nMost types of tiles that are made from clay or a mixture of clay and other materials and then kiln-fired, are considered to be a part of the larger classification called “Ceramic Tiles”. These tiles can be split into two groups, porcelain tiles and non-porcelain tiles. These non-porcelain tiles are frequently referred to as ceramic tiles by themselves, separate from porcelain tiles - confusing!\nNon-porcelain ceramic tiles are generally made from red or white clay fired in a kiln. They are almost always finished with a durable glaze, which carries the color and pattern. These tiles are used in both wall and floor applications. Non-porcelain ceramic tiles are usually suitable for very light to moderate traffic and generally have a relatively high water absorption rating making them less frost resistant and they are more prone to wear and chipping than porcelain tiles. Porcelain tile is more scratch resistant than ceramic tile. Also, porcelain tile is fired at higher temperatures than ceramic, resulting in superior durability and stain resistance.\nPorcelain unglazed tile is generally made by the dust pressed method from porcelain clays which result in a tile that is dense, impervious, fine grained and smooth, with a sharply formed face. Porcelain tiles usually have a much lower water absorption rate (less than 0.5%) than non-porcelain ceramic tiles making them frost resistant. Full body porcelain tiles carry the color and pattern through the entire thickness of the tile making them virtually impervious to wear and are suitable for any application from residential to the highest traffic commercial or industrial applications. Because porcelain tile is fire-hardened and quite hard, it can be cleaned at pressures up to 1, 450 PSI if the grout is in good condition.\nPorcelain unglazed tiles are similar to glazed tile, except that their surface is not coated. Full-body porcelain unglazed tiles do not show wear because their color extends throughout the tile, making them ideal for commercial applications.\nPEI classes range from 0 to 5. The Porcelain Enamel Institute rating scale is not a measurement of quality. It is a scale that clearly indicates the areas of use each manufacturer recommends and has designed their tile to fit. A PEI 2 tile has been designed for areas where very low traffic and soiling is anticipated. In most cases the aesthetic detailing of these tiles is of prime consideration. You will often find high gloss levels, vibrant colorations and metallic elements in this group of tile. Conversely, a PEI 5 tile has been designed for abusive extra heavy foot traffic:\n- PEI Class 0 - No Foot Traffic: Wall tile only and should not be used on floors\n- PEI Class 1 - Very light traffic: Very low foot traffic, bare or stocking feet only. (Master bath, spa bathroom).\n- PEI Class 2 - Light Traffic: Slipper or soft-soled shoes. Second level main bathroom areas, bedrooms.\n- PEI Class 3 - Light to Moderate Traffic: Any residential area with the possible exception of some entries and kitchens if extremely heavy or abrasive traffic is anticipated.\n- PEI Class 4 - Moderate to Heavy Traffic: High foot traffic, areas where abrasive or outside dirt could be tracked. Residential entry, kitchen, balcony, and countertop.\n- PEI Class 5 - Heavy Traffic: Ceramic tile suggested for residential, commercial and institutional floor subjected to heavy traffic.\nSealing Ceramic and Porcelain Tile & Grout\nGlazed tiles are coated with a liquid glass, which is then baked into the surface of the clay. The glaze provides an unlimited array of colors and designs as well as protects the tile from staining. A glazed tile is already stain proof, so there is no purpose to putting on a sealer. However, the grout joint between the tiles is usually very porous and generally made of a cement-based material. Therefore, grout joints typically will need to be sealed and maintained properly to prevent stains and discoloration. Impregnating sealers such as All-Purpose Grout Sealer go into the grout joint and protect against water and oil-based stains. Most industry professionals recognize that grout is best protected with a fluorochemical-based sealer, such as Impregnator Pro or All-Purpose Grout Sealer. If the grout joint is epoxy, a sealer is not necessary.\nUnglazed porcelain tile should be protected with a penetrating sealer, such as Sta-Clene, Bullet Proof or Impregnator Pro, including the grout lines. The penetrating sealer is an invisible, stain resistant shield that is absorbed into the surface.\nCementitious grout must be sealed to prevent or minimize staining. Leaving these surfaces unsealed may greatly hinder the ability to completely remove stains in the future. Allow new installations to cure for 72 hours prior to applying sealer.\nFor a natural looking protector on interior surfaces (heavy duty protection, water and oil repellency):\n- Sweep or vacuum all dust, dirt and debris.\n- Mask off and protect any baseboards or adjacent areas to avoid splashing and overspray onto surfaces not intended to be treated.\n- Ensure that the surface is clean, dry and residue-free.\n- Allow sealer to completely penetrate into the grout, 5-15 minutes.\n- Liberally apply a second coat of Grout Sealer following steps 4-5.\n- Wipe up all sealer from the surface of the tile. Use a clean, dry, lint-free, cotton towel or mop to remove excess sealer. Or, go over the floor with a cotton bonnet on a low-speed buffer.\n- If sealer was not completely wiped off and a residue appears, wipe entire surface with a towel dampened with sealer. Use a white, non-abrasive nylon brush or pad to loosen residue and follow with a clean, white absorbent towel to remove.\n- A full cure is achieved after 24-48 hours; foot traffic may begin in 4 hours. Cover with red rosin paper, if foot traffic must resume before the recommended time periods have passed.\n- Expected coverage is 600-1, 000 sq. ft. per gallon based upon grout joint width.\n- A 3-5 year re-application is needed for interior surfaces.\nCleaning Ceramic and Porcelain Tile & Grout\n- Keeping ceramic, porcelain tile & grout free of dust and dry, sandy soil will minimize scratches, wear patterns and grout soiling that can develop from everyday use and traffic.\n- Use walk-off mats to trap abrasive soil before it gets into the house or building.\n- Sweep, dust or vacuum surfaces regularly to remove loose soil and dust.\n- Clean the tile & grout using warm water and a clean nonabrasive cloth sponge or mop.\n- Use a neutral cleaner such as Stone & Tile Cleaner or Revitalizer that is specially formulated for ceramic, porcelain tile & grout to help remove soils that sweeping, dusting, vacuuming or damp mopping leave behind.\n- Do not use ordinary household cleaners, as you may degrade the sealer that was applied to the grout to protect against stains.\nCountertops and Vanities\nUse a ph-balanced cleaner such as Stone & Tile Cleaner or Revitalizer to keep surfaces clean from everyday soils and stains.']	['<urn:uuid:b029cf19-7a00-4b32-b233-2fa4c3843b35>', '<urn:uuid:f4754a5a-41a0-48fd-bd9f-22ee43519bbe>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	8	58	2188

The phototransistor uses a capacitor discharge circuit that allows a digital I/O line on a microcontroller to take an analog reading of reflected IR by measuring the discharge time of the capacitor. Shorter capacitor discharge time is an indication of greater reflection. For a similar sensor with an analog voltage output, see the QTR-1A reflectance sensor.\nThe LED current-limiting resistor is set to deliver approximately 17 mA to the LED when VIN is 5 V. The current requirement can be met by some microcontroller I/O lines, allowing the sensor to be powered up and down through an I/O line to conserve power.\nThis sensor was designed to be used with the board parallel to the surface being sensed. Because of its small size, multiple units can easily be arranged to fit various applications such as line sensing and proximity/edge detection. For a line sensor with eight of these units arranged in a row, please see the QTR-8RC reflectance sensor array; for a similar array of three slightly different sensor components, see the QTR-3RC. For a similar, smaller sensor with longer range, and intended for use with the board perpendicular to the surface, please see the QTR-L-1RC reflectance sensor.\nQTR sensor size comparison.

This measurement approach has several advantages, especially when multiple units are used:\n- No analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is required\n- Improved sensitivity over voltage-divider analog output\n- Parallel reading of multiple sensors is possible with most microcontrollers\nThe typical sequence for reading a sensor is:\n- Set the I/O line to an output and drive it high\n- Allow at least 10 us for the 10 nF capacitor to charge\n- Make the I/O line an input (high impedance)\n- Measure the time for the capacitor to discharge by waiting for the I/O line to go low\nThese steps can typically be executed in parallel on multiple I/O lines.\nWith a strong reflectance, the discharge time can be as low as several dozen microseconds; with no reflectance, the discharge time can be up to a few milliseconds. The exact time of the discharge depends on your microcontroller’s I/O line characteristics. Meaningful results can be available within 1 ms in typical cases (i.e. when not trying to measure subtle differences in low-reflectance scenarios), allowing up to 1 kHz sampling.\nOur Pololu AVR library provides functions that make it easy to use these sensors with our Orangutan robot controllers; please see the QTR Reflectance Sensors section of our library command reference for more information. We also have a Arduino library for these sensors.\nThis module has a single mounting hole intended for a #2 screw (not included); if this mounting hole is not needed, this portion of the PCB can be ground off to make the unit even smaller. The reflectance sensor ships with a 3-pin 0.1"" header strip, which can be soldered in the conventional perpendicular orientation or parallel to the PCB, as shown below. You can also solder wires, such as ribbon cable, directly to the pads for the smallest installation.\nAn example of soldering header pins parallel to QTR-1A PCB for compact installation.\nPeople often buy this product together with:\n|Sharp GP2Y0A21YK0F Analog Distance Sensor 10-80cm|\n|TB6612FNG Dual Motor Driver Carrier|\n|QTR-8RC Reflectance Sensor Array|']"	['<urn:uuid:b5333717-5f66-4abe-84fb-4d3f8318e480>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	5	13	761
84	investeu program main objectives financial framework 2021 2027	The InvestEU programme focuses on promoting sustainable infrastructure, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), fostering research and innovation, and investing in social development and skills. It aims to strengthen investment activity in the EU, including long-term investment projects of high public interest, while respecting sustainable development criteria.	"[""The absence of economic and social convergence among Member States and regions is a threat to the political sustainability of the European project and all the benefits it has brought to European citizens. Developing economic and labour market resilience with economic, social, environmental and institutional sustainability should be the principle guiding policies. This will foster upwards convergence and fairness in the transition towards a climate-neutral economy while managing the challenges posed by digitalisation and demographic change.\nAlthough considerable progress has already been made towards completing EMU, there is still a need to significantly reinforce all four of its pillars, taking care to maintain the balance between them, as neglecting one or more of these pillars could result in dangerous disparities. Resilience to crises is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for completing EMU: it also requires a positive vision, as set out in Article 3 of the EU Treaty. The EESC generally calls on the European institutions and national governments to take much more ambitious action in the context of EMU reform in order to achieve a more integrated, more democratic and socially better developed Union.\nThe EESC welcomes the Investment Plan for Europe for its contribution to the promotion of investment in the EU. The Committee calls for clearly set investment targets, regulatory simplification and further guidance in order to achieve greater geographical and sectoral balance. The EESC advocates for strengthened financial capacity for the InvestEU programme within the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027 and calls for more efforts to raise awareness among European businesses and citizens about the benefits obtained from the Investment Plan for Europe.\nThe EESC notes that the international role of the euro has not yet recovered to the pre-financial crisis level. Whereas the European Commission's proposed measures are welcome and deemed necessary by the EESC, they may not go far enough given the extent of the euro area's social and economic challenges. Social cohesion, economic upward convergence and the promotion of competitiveness and innovation should be the basis on which the euro area's economy gathers pace and supports a stronger international role for the euro.\nThe EESC is of the opinion that building economic resilience, an objective that underlies the recommendations of the European Commission on the economic policy of the euro area, is of the utmost importance for the euro area economies. However, the Committee would like to stress that the pursuit of economic resilience should go hand in hand with increased labour market resilience, that is, the capacity of labour markets to weather shocks with limited social costs.\nThe EESC considers the proposed European Investment Stabilisation Function (EISF) as a step towards closer euro area integration, and possibly an attempt to encourage non-euro Member States to join the single currency. However, the EESC is of the view that a well-crafted union-wide insurance scheme that acts as an automatic stabiliser amidst macroeconomic shocks would be more effective than the proposed EISF.\nThe EESC agrees with the aims of the Council Recommendation and with some of its proposals. However, it expresses its disagreement with the proposal for the aggregate fiscal stance of the euro area to be neutral, as well as with the way that the recommendation on salaries is formulated.\nThe EESC welcomes the fact that the package of regulations on the future multiannual financial framework includes the InvestEU proposal to strengthen investment activity in the EU, including long-term investment projects that are of high public interest, while also respecting the sustainable development criteria. In order to guarantee that this programme operates successfully, the Committee underlines the importance of the involvement of civil society organisations and social and economic partners. The EESC appreciates the European Commission's efforts to create an umbrella financial instrument by the InvestEU programme that will result in unified management, enhanced transparency and potential for synergies. The EESC appreciates the fact that, in addition to promoting sustainable infrastructure, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and research and innovation, the InvestEU programme also focuses on social investment and skills.""]"	['<urn:uuid:7a13a8fa-9422-4f47-ab47-04eab2ac8b64>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	8	47	666
85	business owner need insurance types named perils all risks what difference and exclusions	Named Perils and All Risks are two distinct types of business property insurance. Named Perils policies provide protection only for specific events like fire, smoke, windstorm, hail, vandalism, and sprinkler leakage, and are usually less expensive due to limited coverage. All Risks policies provide broader protection for any loss except specifically excluded events. Common exclusions in All Risks policies include earthquakes, floods, wear and tear, acts of war, power failure, employee dishonesty, rust and corrosion, fungus and mold, infestations, and mechanical breakdowns.	"['Commercial property business insurance is priority #1 to protect the future of your business and the substantial investments and assets involved with your operations. Whether you own your building, lease your premises or work from home, commercial property insurance can be tailored to protect all your physical assets against loss or damage from a variety of causes including fire, theft, smoke, water and vandalism.\nIf you are renting your business space, a general property insurance policy provides coverage for your equipment, furniture, valuable documents, inventory, outdoor signage, and other real and personal property owned by your business. (Most leases require some type of business property insurance.)\nCommercial property insurance also protects you as a renter—against law suits that could arise due to something you are alleged to have done, or not done and should have, that damages the building you rent.\nBusiness property insurance is becoming an increasingly more important type of coverage as more frequently complainants are turning to the legal system to settle business conflicts. In this regard, business property insurance protects your business in that your legal costs would be covered to defend it against insurable allegations.\nThere are two types of business property insurance policies: 1) “Named Perils,” and 2) “All Risks.”\nNamed Perils Policy: Provides protection for specific events such as fire, smoke, windstorm, hail, vandalism, or sprinkler leakage. The policy only covers those events named in the policy and is usually less expensive because it provides limited coverage.\nAll Risks Policy: An “All Risks” policy does not mean that all losses will be covered. Rather, it provides protection for any loss by perils not specifically listed as exclusions in the policy. Common exclusions in an “All Risks” policy include: earthquake, flood, wear and tear, illegally acquired property, etc. However, you can add numerous riders and endorsements to your policy to add coverage such as: earthquake, etc.\nProperty insurance can either be purchased on a “replacement cost” basis or an “actual cash value” basis.\nReplacement Cost: Is the amount it would take to replace or rebuild your business, or the damaged part of it, with materials of like kind and quality, without deducting any depreciation. Replacement cost does not include the value of your land.\nActual Cash Value: Is the amount it would take to repair or replace the damaged or stolen property after deducting for depreciation.\nN.B. Whether your business is insured for replacement value or actual cash value, it is important to review the value of your property on a regular basis. Inflation tends to increase the replacement cost of your property, while the actual cash value may decrease over time. The value of your property can be determined by using the original construction costs, regional construction costs guidelines, or by hiring a professional appraiser.\nAlso, if your property contains valuable items such as fine arts, accounts receivable, or valuable papers and records, you may need to buy additional protection to cover these specific items.\nBundling of coverage needs under a “package policy” provides many of the coverage enhancements required for full protection on all insurable exposures thereby avoiding gaps in essential coverage. The package policy concept leads to the best coverage for the price – a winning combination.\nWe are committed to helping you get the unique insurance coverage you need to ensure your business succeeds!', 'If you\'re in the market for a Commercial Property Insurance policy (and why wouldn\'t you be? Your office and equipment aren\'t going to insure themselves!), chances are you\'re going to run across one of two phrases to describe the coverage:\n- Named perils: covers damage caused by events explicitly named in the policy.\n- Open or all perils (also called all risks): covers damage caused by all events except those explicitly excluded in the policy.\nIf you\'re like many small-business owners, you may see the phrase ""all perils"" and think your business is in the clear for any and every kind of property damage that comes its way. But unfortunately, all perils coverage has its limits because there\'s no such thing as an insurance policy that can cover everything. Let\'s take a closer look at what all perils policies are about and when they make the most sense for your business.\nOh, Come, All Ye Perils\nAll perils policies tend to be more comprehensive than named perils policies. Whereas a named perils policy spells out a handful of events it can cover (e.g., windstorms, theft, vandalism, and fires), an all perils policy spells out the events that are excluded from coverage. So long as the insurance company can\'t prove that the damage is excluded, the all perils coverage can apply.\nSo what are common exclusions in an all perils policy? Don\'t be surprised if you can\'t make a claim for property damage caused by:\n- Acts of war.\n- Seepage and sewer backups.\n- Governmental seizure or destruction of property.\n- Boiler explosions.\n- Power failure.\n- Electrical damage to electrical devices.\n- Employee dishonesty.\n- Wear and tear.\n- Rust and corrosion.\n- Fungus and mold.\n- Infestations (animal or insect).\n- Mechanical breakdowns.\n- Theft from a building under construction.\n- Intentional loss.\nThe good news: if you\'re worried about some of these events, like floods and earthquakes, you can always purchase Flood or Earthquake Insurance as a rider. Learn more about these policies in ""Spring Flood Season\'s Here. Is Your Business Ready?"" and ""So You Want to Know about Earthquake Insurance.""\nGo All In with All Risk or Opt for Named Perils?\nNow that you know a little more about what you can expect from an open perils policy, the question remains: which type of Property Insurance policy is right for your business? As with so many decisions, money may be the deciding factor, but weigh the cost against how much coverage you get.\nKeep in mind that…\n- Named perils policies tend to be less expensive, but they cover fewer events.\n- Open perils policies may be more expensive, but they offer greater coverage.\nAlso know that with a named perils policy, it\'s up to you – the insured – to prove that the named peril caused the damage. For all perils policies, the burden of proof belongs to the insurance provider – it would have to prove that an event was excluded to deny coverage.\nAs always, your insurance agent is the best resource for your insurance questions. They can help you decide if broader coverage makes sense given your location and physical assets.']"	['<urn:uuid:b0c87516-2c80-44cb-84d1-f0a41f83c441>', '<urn:uuid:76155898-38dd-4621-b415-baa95af9dd49>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	13	82	1083
86	How is isopropyl alcohol manufactured industrially and what are its physical properties?	Isopropyl alcohol is produced through two main processes: indirect and direct hydration. The indirect process, predominant in the USA, reacts propylene with sulfuric acid to form sulfate esters that are then hydrolyzed. The direct hydration process, more common in Europe, combines propylene and water at high pressures using acidic catalysts. Both processes require distillation to separate isopropyl alcohol from water, forming an azeotrope that is 87.9% isopropyl alcohol by weight. As for physical properties, it is a colorless, flammable compound with a strong odor. It has a melting point of -89°C, boiling point of 82.6°C, and density of 0.786 g/cm3 at 20°C. It is miscible with water, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and ether, and its viscosity decreases with increasing temperature.	"['Isopropyl alcohol (also isopropanol, iso, isopro, rubbing alcohol, or the abbreviation IPA) is a common name for propan-2-ol, a colorless, flammable chemical compound with a strong odor. It has the molecular formula C3H8O and is the simplest example of a secondary alcohol, where the alcohol carbon is attached to two other carbons. It is an isomer of propanol.\nIsopropyl alcohol is produced by combining water and propene. There are two processes for achieving this: indirect hydration via the sulfuric acid process and direct hydration. The former process, which can use low quality propylene, predominates in the USA while the latter process, which requires high-purity propylene, is more commonly used in Europe. These processes give predominantly isopropyl alcohol rather than propan-1-ol because the addition of water or sulfuric acid to propylene follows Markovnikov\'s rule.\nThe indirect process reacts propylene with sulfuric acid to form a mixture of sulfate esters. Subsequent hydrolysis of these esters produces isopropyl alcohol. Direct hydration reacts propylene and water, either in gas or liquid phases, at high pressures in the presence of solid or supported acidic catalysts. Both processes require that the isopropyl alcohol be separated from water and other by-products by distillation. Isopropyl alcohol and water form an azeotrope and simple distillation gives a material which is 87.9% by weight isopropyl alcohol and 12.1% by weight water. Pure (anhydrous) isopropyl alcohol is made by azeotropic distillation of the ""wet"" isopropyl alcohol using either diisopropyl ether or cyclohexane as azeotroping agents.\nAs a preservative (for biological specimens) isopropyl alcohol provides a cost-effective (when compared to pure ethanol) and comparatively non-toxic solution to formaldehyde and other synthetic preservatives. When used for the preservation of specimens in solution concentrations of 90-99% are optimal, though concentrations as low as 70% can be used in emergencies.\nIsopropanol is a major ingredient in ""dry-gas"" fuel additive. In significant quantities, water is a problem in fuel tanks as it separates from the gasoline and can freeze in the supply lines at cold temperatures. The isopropanol does not remove the water from the gasoline; rather, the isopropanol solubilizes the water in the gasoline. Once soluble, the water does not pose the same risk as insoluble water as it will no longer accumulate in the supply lines and freeze. Isopropanol is often sold in aerosol cans as a windscreen de-icer.\nIt can also be used to remove stains from any fabric, wood, cotton, etc.\nBeing a secondary alcohol, isopropanol can be oxidized to the ketone acetone. This can be achieved using oxidizing agents such as chromic acid, or by dehydrogenation of isopropanol over a heated copper catalyst:\nLike most alcohols, isopropyl alcohol reacts with active metals such as potassium to form alkoxides which can be called isopropoxides. The reaction with aluminium (initiated by a trace of mercury) is used to prepare the catalyst aluminium isopropoxide.\nLike many organic solvents, long term application to the skin can cause defatting.\nIsopropyl alcohol is about twice as toxic as ethanol, though isopropyl alcohol does not cause an anion gap acidosis as do ethanol and methanol. It produces an elevated osmolal gap, but generally no abnormal anion gap (though this may be seen as a result of hypotension and lactic acidosis). Overdoses may cause a fruity odor on the breath as a result of its metabolism to give acetone which is not further metabolized. Isopropyl alcohol is more potent than ethanol as a CNS depressant, and its metabolite, acetone, is a CNS depressant in its own right. While around 15 g of isopropanol can be fatal if left untreated, it is not nearly as toxic as methanol or ethylene glycol.\nAgency Reviews Patent Application Approval Request for ""Highly Productive Isopropyl Alcohol-Producing Bacterium""\nJan 23, 2013; By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Biotech Week -- Mitsui Chemicals Inc. has been issued patent application serial number...\nWIPO PUBLISHES PATENT OF MITSUI CHEMICALS FOR ""ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL-PRODUCING BACTERIUM HAVING IMPROVED PRODUCTIVITY BY GNTR DESTRUCTION"" (JAPANESE INVENTORS)\nFeb 18, 2012; GENEVA, Feb. 18 -- Publication No. WO/2012/020833 was published on Feb. 16.

IUPAC considers isopropanol an incorrect name as the hydrocarbon isopropane does not exist.\nIsopropyl alcohol is miscible in water, ethanol, ether, and chloroform. It dissolves ethyl cellulose, polyvinyl butyral, many oils, alkaloids, gums and natural resins. Unlike ethanol or methanol, isopropyl alcohol is not miscible with salt solutions and can be separated from aqueous solutions by adding a salt such as sodium chloride. The process is colloquially called salting out, and causes concentrated isopropyl alcohol to separate into a distinct layer.\nIsopropyl alcohol forms an azeotrope with water, which gives a boiling point of 80.37 °C (176.67 °F) and a composition of 87.7 wt% (91 vol%) isopropyl alcohol. Water-isopropyl alcohol mixtures have depressed melting points. It has a slightly bitter taste, and is not safe to drink.\nIsopropyl alcohol becomes increasingly viscous with decreasing temperature and freezes at −89 °C (−128 °F).\nIsopropyl alcohol can be oxidized to acetone, which is the corresponding ketone. This can be achieved using oxidizing agents such as chromic acid, or by dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol over a heated copper catalyst:\n- (CH3)2CHOH → (CH3)2CO + H2\nIsopropyl alcohol is often used as both solvent and hydride source in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction and other transfer hydrogenation reactions. Isopropyl alcohol may be converted to 2-bromopropane using phosphorus tribromide, or dehydrated to propene by heating with sulfuric acid.\nLike most alcohols, isopropyl alcohol reacts with active metals such as potassium to form alkoxides that can be called isopropoxides. The reaction with aluminium (initiated by a trace of mercury) is used to prepare the catalyst aluminium isopropoxide.\nIn 1920, Standard Oil first produced isopropyl alcohol by hydrating propene. Its major use at the time was not rubbing alcohol but for oxidation to acetone, whose first major use was in World War I for the preparation of cordite, a smokeless, low explosive propellant.\nIn 1994, 1.5 million tonnes of isopropyl alcohol were produced in the United States, Europe, and Japan. It is primarily produced by combining water and propene in a hydration reaction or by hydrogenating acetone. There are two routes for the hydration process and both processes require that the isopropyl alcohol be separated from water and other by-products by distillation. Isopropyl alcohol and water form an azeotrope and simple distillation gives a material that is 87.9% by weight isopropyl alcohol and 12.1% by weight water. Pure (anhydrous) isopropyl alcohol is made by azeotropic distillation of the wet isopropyl alcohol using either diisopropyl ether or cyclohexane as azeotroping agents.\nIndirect hydration reacts propene with sulfuric acid to form a mixture of sulfate esters. This process can use low-quality propene, and is predominant in the USA. These processes give primarily isopropyl alcohol rather than 1-propanol, because adding water or sulfuric acid to propene follows Markovnikov\'s rule. Subsequent hydrolysis of these esters by steam produces isopropyl alcohol, by distillation. Diisopropyl ether is a significant by-product of this process; it is recycled back to the process and hydrolyzed to give the desired product.\nDirect hydration reacts propene and water, either in gas phase or in liquid phase, at high pressures in the presence of solid or supported acidic catalysts. This type of process usually requires higher-purity propylene (> 90%). Direct hydration is more commonly used in Europe.\nIn 1990, 45,000 metric tonnes of isopropyl alcohol were used in the United States, mostly as a solvent for coatings or for industrial processes. In that year, 5400 metric tons were used for household purposes and in personal care products. Isopropyl alcohol is popular in particular for pharmaceutical applications, due to its low toxicity. Some isopropyl alcohol is used as a chemical intermediate. Isopropyl alcohol may be converted to acetone, but the cumene process is more significant. It is also used as a gasoline additive.\nIsopropyl alcohol dissolves a wide range of non-polar compounds. It also evaporates quickly, leaves nearly zero oil traces, compared to ethanol, and is relatively non-toxic, compared to alternative solvents. Thus, it is used widely as a solvent and as a cleaning fluid, especially for dissolving oils. Together with ethanol, n-butanol, and methanol, it belongs to the group of alcohol solvents, about 6.4 million tonnes of which were used worldwide in 2011.\nIsopropyl alcohol is commonly used for cleaning eyeglasses, electrical contacts, audio or video tape heads, DVD and other optical disc lenses, removing thermal paste from heatsinks on CPUs and other IC packages, etc.\nIsopropyl alcohol is esterified to give isopropyl acetate, another solvent. It reacts with carbon disulfide and sodium hydroxide to give sodium isopropylxanthate, a herbicide and an ore flotation reagent. Isopropyl alcohol reacts with titanium tetrachloride and aluminium metal to give titanium and aluminium isopropoxides, respectively, the former a catalyst, and the latter a chemical reagent. This compound may serve as a chemical reagent in itself, by acting as a dihydrogen donor in transfer hydrogenation.\nRubbing alcohol, hand sanitizer, and disinfecting pads typically contain a 60–70% solution of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol in water. Water is required to open up membrane pores of bacteria, which acts as a gateway for isopropyl alcohol. A 75% v/v solution in water may be used as a hand sanitizer. Isopropyl alcohol is used as a water-drying aid for the prevention of otitis externa, better known as swimmer\'s ear.\nEarly uses as an anesthetic\nAlthough isopropyl alcohol can be used for anesthesia, its many negative attributes or drawbacks prohibit this use. Isopropyl alcohol can also be used similarly to ether as a solvent or as an anesthetic by inhaling the fumes or orally. Early uses included using the solvent as general anesthetic for small mammals and rodents by scientists and some veterinarians. However, it was soon discontinued, as many complications arose, including respiratory irritation, internal bleeding, and visual and hearing problems. In rare cases, respiratory failure leading to death in animals was observed.\nIsopropyl alcohol is a major ingredient in ""gas dryer"" fuel additives. In significant quantities water is a problem in fuel tanks, as it separates from gasoline and can freeze in the supply lines at low temperatures. Alcohol does not remove water from gasoline—but the alcohol solubilizes water in gasoline. Once soluble, water does not pose the same risk as insoluble water, as it no longer accumulates in the supply lines and freezes, but is consumed with the fuel itself. Isopropyl alcohol is often sold in aerosol cans as a windshield or door lock deicer. Isopropyl alcohol is also used to remove brake fluid traces from hydraulic braking systems, so that the brake fluid (usually DOT 3, DOT 4, or mineral oil) does not contaminate the brake pads and cause poor braking. Mixtures of isopropyl alcohol and water are also commonly used in homemade windshield washer fluid.\nAs a biological specimen preservative, isopropyl alcohol provides a comparatively non-toxic alternative to formaldehyde and other synthetic preservatives. Isopropyl alcohol solutions of 70–99% are used to preserve specimens.\nIsopropyl alcohol is often used in DNA extraction. A lab worker adds it to a DNA solution to precipitate the DNA, which then forms a pellet after centrifugation. This is possible because DNA is insoluble in isopropyl alcohol.\nIsopropyl alcohol vapor is denser than air and is flammable, with a flammability range of between 2 and 12.7% in air. It should be kept away from heat and open flame. Distillation of isopropyl alcohol over magnesium has been reported to form peroxides, which may explode upon concentration. Isopropyl alcohol is a skin irritant. Wearing protective gloves is recommended.\nIsopropyl alcohol and its metabolite, acetone, act as central nervous system (CNS) depressants. Poisoning can occur from ingestion, inhalation, or skin absorption. Symptoms of isopropyl alcohol poisoning include flushing, headache, dizziness, CNS depression, nausea, vomiting, anesthesia, hypothermia, low blood pressure, shock, respiratory depression, and coma. Overdoses may cause a fruity odor on the breath as a result of its metabolism to acetone. Isopropyl alcohol does not cause an anion gap acidosis but it produces an osmolal gap between the calculated and measured osmolalities of serum, as do the other alcohols.\nIsopropyl alcohol is oxidized to form acetone by alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver, and has a biological half-life in humans between 2.5 and 8.0 hours. Unlike methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning, the metabolites of isopropyl alcohol are considerably less toxic, and treatment is largely supportive. Furthermore, there is no indication for the use of fomepizole, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, unless co-ingestion with methanol or ethylene glycol is suspected.\n- Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry : IUPAC Recommendations and Preferred Names 2013 (Blue Book).

87	I heard nuclear waste is a big problem but fusion energy might be cleaner - how does nuclear fusion compare to regular nuclear power in terms of waste production, and what happens to nuclear waste in general?	Nuclear fusion produces significantly less waste than nuclear fission (regular nuclear power) and the waste it does produce has a shorter half-life of a few hundred years. When using helium-3 as fuel, fusion can be even cleaner since it produces no neutrons. As for current nuclear waste management, about 90% is low-level waste like contaminated tools and clothing. The high-level waste is typically stored in cooling pools near nuclear reactors, with most of Britain's waste being stored at the Sellafield site in Cumbria. While proposals like shooting waste into space have been considered, the cost would be prohibitive at around $1.2 trillion. Instead, research is focused on recycling nuclear waste and making it less toxic.	['The world will face a severe energy shortage in the future because of the high demand to support billions of people and the shortage of fossil fuels. Renewable resources like wind and solar energy are volatile and weather dependent.\nTo meet the increasing demand, alternative sources of clean, low-cost energy are required. This is a big challenge for governments around the world and the industry. Fusion has the potential to provide an always available, environmentally benign, and well-distributed energy solution. Progress in fusion energy is accelerating over the last few decades as both government and private sectors have started investing in this sector.\nWhat is Fusion?\nFusion is a nuclear reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei combine to form one or more different atomic nuclei and often subatomic particles. The Fusion of light elements releases energy due to the interplay of two opposing forces: the strong nuclear force, which holds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus, and the Coulomb force, which causes positively charged protons to repel each other.\nFission and Fusion, What is the Difference?\nFission and Fusion are two physical processes that can generate massive energy from reactions between atoms. Nuclear Fusion is a reaction between two or more nuclei of atoms to fuse and form different atomic nuclei. This reaction results in the release of energy; this is the natural phenomenon in the sun to produce its energy. The energy produced by these nuclear reactions is millions of times more than other sources of energy.\nFusion is considered superior to fission as the amount of energy produced by Fusion is far greater than the fission reaction. The primary difference between these two types of reactions is explained here:\nA fusion reaction occurs in the sun by combining isotopes of hydrogen called Deuterium and Tritium under immense atmospheric pressure and extremely high temperatures. This combination forms a new element with a higher atomic number, and also a massive amount of energy is released.\nDeuterium + Tritium = He + n + Energy\nOn the other side, nuclear fission is the splitting of a massive nucleus into different subatomic particles. In a typical fission reaction, Uranium is involved.\n23592U + n = 23692U\n23692U = 14456Ba + 89 36Kr + 3n + Energy\nAfter both fusion and fission reactions, the newly formed resultants’ mass is less than the total mass before the reaction.\nBasics of Fusion Reaction and Fusion Reactors, is it Feasible?\nThere is a need for a high-temperature environment for a fusion reaction to occur, the same as found in the sun or other stars. Hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium and energy. Hydrogen is heated at high temperatures, and that changes this into plasma, where electrons are separated from the nuclei.\nSuch conditions can occur when the temperature increases, causing the ions to move faster and eventually reach speeds high enough to bring the ions close together. The nuclei can then fuse, causing a release of energy. To produce and sustain these high temperatures requires special containers.\nMost experimental nuclear reactors use a donut-shaped design called a tokamak. These machines use powerful magnetic fields to confine cloud and plasma or ionized gas at extreme temperatures so atoms can fuse. This fusion reaction produces a lot of heat, which would generate steam, and the steam would then drive turbines or generators. It is highly compatible with our existing power systems.\nFusion power plants could be one-to-one replacements for fossil fuel plants, without any need to restructure electrical grids for them. Other energy sources such as solar and wind are not accommodated well by the current design of electric grids. Fusion energy is also safe as runaway incidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima are not possible. Because when the energy stream is used to heat and speed, the nuclear reaction is stopped, the process stops. The nuclear waste produced is far less than that of fission reaction and has a half-life of a few hundred years.\nHelium-3 Vs. Tritium\nAs mentioned, the isotopes of hydrogen (deuterium (H-2) and tritium (H-3)) are used as fuel for fusion reactions. Some benefits of fusion reactions are, Fusion does not produce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which drives global warming, nor does it generate other pollutants. And the fuel for Fusion, such as the element hydrogen, is plentiful enough on Earth to meet all of humanity’s energy needs for millions of years. Both of these isotopes are found in ordinary water. However, technological development for efficient and low-cost solutions keeps the researchers busy to find new solutions. Using hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium for fusion reaction has a disadvantage, that it produces neutrons. If Helium-3 is used, it offers a remarkable advantage, and its Fusion with deuterium is more efficient than deuterium-tritium. More energy is produced with less waste, i.e., is no neutrons are generated. Helium-3 is non-radioactive and would not produce any dangerous waste.\nMining the Moon\nSun dispense a large amount of Helium-3, but the Earth has an atmospheric shield that does not allow it. On the other hand, the Moon shows no such resistance to helium-3 and has millions of tons of helium-3 on its surface.\nNow the goal is to mine the Moon and gather Helium-3 for fueling future fusion reactors. Europe, India, and China are actively working on ideas about extracting Helium-3 from the Moon. Their governments are planning to launch new programs and implement legislations to participate in this race of moon mining actively. NASA is already planning a lunar Gateway — a spacecraft with living quarters, research laboratories, and docking points for spaceships — that will orbit the Moon and provide access to the lunar surface.\nMany technologies like remote sensing, Visible Imaging, Neutron Spectrometer, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER), and more have been developed for moon mining operations.\nRobots for Lunar Exploration\nRobotics also plays a critical role in all space explorations, including moon mining. Robots are used in services like construction, maintenance, surveillance, exploration, etc., in space missions. Robotics are connected to multiple other technologies and emerging fields to contribute to space exploration and engineering.\nRobotics and remote handling technologies significantly improve human’s ability and help to cross the limitations. Two important attributes of robotics that are essential are locomotion and autonomy. A robot for space-based applications must be designed to have locomotion to manipulate grip, rove, and drill, etc. Its autonomy can make it a human proxy to conduct various tasks using teleoperations.\nThese autonomous systems reduce the load from humans and execute the tasks more effectively and timely. To meet the long-term need for exploration and science, various robotic mission concepts need to be brought, and research efforts are required from both academia and industry. The future of space explorations will bring even larger goals and require space robots with diverse locomotion and autonomy.\nWho Will Mine the Moon\nPreviously the government agencies were the main stakeholders in space explorations, but now commercial enterprises are getting involved and have shown great interest in this area. These enterprises are also investigating and developing technologies to exploit the resources of the Moon. Names like Moon Express, Deep Space Industries, and Planetary Resources are working toward the long-term goal of exploiting the key elements in the Moon and beyond. In the more distant future, the mining of helium-3 from the Moon and elsewhere could provide valuable fuel for fusion reactors.\nFusion energy, with its connection to space exploration and mining, is attracting government and private sectors. In addition to the USA and China, Luxembourg is also taking part in the race by setting up a fund for space mining companies to open offices in the country and make it the hub of space mining innovation. Similarly, the United Arab Emirates is making a multipronged effort to establish a space mining industry, with a billion dollars investment. Several commercial initiatives have started for asteroids and the Moon, by Planetary Resources, Deep Space Industries, Google Lunar X-Prize, Lunar Missions Ltd, Moon Express, etc. To conduct a state of the art research in space mining for the nuclear fusion industry is essential.\nAs mentioned in the article, Fusion hopes to produce power at an economical cost and manufacture a system that can replace the fossil fuel-based power systems. There is a strong need to find cost-effective ways for moon mining, extracting the helium-3, and transporting back to Earth. This could help us transform the energy sector forever.', '- Can we shoot nuclear waste into space?\n- Where is UK nuclear waste stored?\n- Can nuclear waste be destroyed?\n- Can you survive a nuclear war?\n- What are the 3 types of nuclear waste?\n- Where does the US get its uranium from?\n- Do nuclear rods glow?\n- Is nuclear waste green?\n- What is the color of nuclear?\n- Can you survive a nuclear bomb in a fridge?\n- Could Chernobyl Happen Again?\n- Is anyone still alive from Chernobyl?\n- Where does nuclear waste go?\n- Does uranium glow green?\n- Is Chernobyl elephant’s foot?\n- Why did Chernobyl glow blue?\n- Can you throw nuclear waste volcano?\n- How long does nuclear waste last?\n- What does nuclear waste look like?\n- Is Chernobyl reactor 4 still burning?\n- Why is nuclear waste bad?\nCan we shoot nuclear waste into space?\n$1.2 trillion to launch the high-level waste into the Sun on a trajectory that takes a long long time.\nThe bottom line is that blasting our nuclear waste off into space, into the Sun, is just too expensive – by several orders of magnitude.\nNo, we need to learn how to recycle nuclear waste, to make it less toxic..\nWhere is UK nuclear waste stored?\nSellafield nuclear plant siteAround 80 percent of Britain’s nuclear waste is currently stored at the Sellafield nuclear plant site in Cumbria, in the northwest of England.\nCan nuclear waste be destroyed?\nIt can be done. Long-term nuclear waste can be “burned up” in the thorium reactor to become much more manageable.\nCan you survive a nuclear war?\nIf a nuclear weapon is about to explode, here’s what a safety expert says you can do to survive. Nuclear bombs are extremely deadly weapons, but their worst effects are confined to a limited zone. A government safety expert says it’s entirely possible to survive a nuclear explosion and its aftereffects.\nWhat are the 3 types of nuclear waste?\nThere are three types of nuclear waste, classified according to their radioactivity: low-, intermediate-, and high-level. The vast majority of the waste (90% of total volume) is composed of only lightly-contaminated items, such as tools and work clothing, and contains only 1% of the total radioactivity.\nWhere does the US get its uranium from?\nDuring 2017, owners and operators of U.S. nuclear power plants purchased 40 million pounds of uranium from foreign suppliers. Canada, Australia, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan represented the top five countries of origin and together accounted for 84% of total U.S. uranium purchases in 2017.\nDo nuclear rods glow?\nCherenkov Radiation is caused when a charged particle moves faster than light would in a medium. … The shorter the wavelength, the more blue the light appears. This is why nuclear reactors glow. The charged particles that they emit travel through water faster than light normally would.\nIs nuclear waste green?\nThe radioactive byproducts of nuclear reactions remain inside the fuel. No green goo anywhere. There is not that much of it. All of the used fuel ever produced by the commercial nuclear industry since the late 1950s would cover a football field to a depth of less than 10 yards.\nWhat is the color of nuclear?\nNormally when people think nuclear reactors the first color that comes to mind is a ghastly almost sickly green color, however nuclear reactors glow a bright blue instead.\nCan you survive a nuclear bomb in a fridge?\nGEORGE LUCAS IS WRONG: You Can’t Survive A Nuclear Bomb By Hiding In A Fridge. … “The odds of surviving that refrigerator — from a lot of scientists — are about 50-50,” Lucas said. But science has spoken, and it says something a little different.\nCould Chernobyl Happen Again?\nThe flow of electricity stops. I do believe our best minds can ensure such designs in the world’s nuclear power plants. If we can ensure that all nuclear power plants in the world are fail-safe designs, then we can indeed say that even though failures could happen, “No, another Chernobyl is simply impossible.”\nIs anyone still alive from Chernobyl?\nContrary to reports that the three divers died of radiation sickness as a result of their action, all three survived. Shift leader Borys Baranov died in 2005, while Valery Bespalov and Oleksiy Ananenko, both chief engineers of one of the reactor sections, are still alive and live in the capital, Kiev.\nWhere does nuclear waste go?\nCommercial energy generation produces the majority of nuclear waste in the U.S., which remains stored above ground near each of the 99 commercial nuclear reactors scattered around the country. Nuclear waste is stored in pools to cool for many years, and some is moved to above-ground concrete casks.\nDoes uranium glow green?\nUranium glass also fluoresces bright green under ultraviolet light and can register above background radiation on a sufficiently sensitive Geiger counter, although most pieces of uranium glass are considered to be harmless and only negligibly radioactive.\nIs Chernobyl elephant’s foot?\nThe Elephant’s Foot is the nickname given to a large mass of corium and other materials formed during the Chernobyl disaster in April 1986 and presently located in a steam distribution corridor underneath the remains of the reactor. It was discovered in December 1986.\nWhy did Chernobyl glow blue?\nThe effect is caused by charged particles flying through a medium at speeds exceeding the speed of light in that medium – in this case, water. The electrons polarise the electric field in the water, creating a light-shockwave, which produces the characteristic blue glow.\nCan you throw nuclear waste volcano?\nA regular lava flow is hazardous enough, but the lava pouring out of a volcano used as a nuclear storage facility would be extremely radioactive. Eventually it would harden, turning that mountain’s slopes into a nuclear wasteland for decades to come.\nHow long does nuclear waste last?\nRadioactive isotopes eventually decay, or disintegrate, to harmless materials. Some isotopes decay in hours or even minutes, but others decay very slowly. Strontium-90 and cesium-137 have half-lives of about 30 years (half the radioactivity will decay in 30 years). Plutonium-239 has a half-life of 24,000 years.\nWhat does nuclear waste look like?\nNuclear energy is released when a nuclear fuel nucleus snaps into two in a reactor. … From the outside, nuclear waste looks exactly like the fuel that was loaded into the reactor — typically assemblies of cylindrical metal rods enclosing fuel pellets.\nIs Chernobyl reactor 4 still burning?\nEarly in the morning of April 26, 1986, the fourth reactor exploded at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine. 34 years later, Chernobyl radioactivity is still circulating. They are now the biggest fires ever recorded in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. …\nWhy is nuclear waste bad?\nNuclear energy produces radioactive waste A major environmental concern related to nuclear power is the creation of radioactive wastes such as uranium mill tailings, spent (used) reactor fuel, and other radioactive wastes. These materials can remain radioactive and dangerous to human health for thousands of years.']	['<urn:uuid:1f6bdd21-3e6b-44f8-9593-267f4a39c71a>', '<urn:uuid:905eb912-739d-478a-a965-5c9bc5db666f>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	37	115	2580
88	what happens if company loses sensitive data	Losing sensitive data can be detrimental to an organization in several ways. There's the potential for competitors to use lost information to their benefit. If customer data is lost, it can harm the company's reputation and lead to loss of customers. Additionally, companies that fail to protect sensitive data may face legal consequences as they are bound by law to keep that data safe.	['Companies all over the world store sensitive data. It could be their customer’s data, data on their business practices, or even state secrets. Data is very valuable, which makes it a potential target for threats.\nData Loss Prevention (DLP) ensures that sensitive data is kept safe from misuse, theft, and accidental loss. Policies are implemented to protect data, DLP software identifies violations of these policies and takes action to help keep data protected.\nOrganizations can hold sensitive data that fall under 3 main categories:\nDLP software places data under specific categories and each of these will be associated with certain regulatory compliance laws. These laws include:\nDLP ensures all data is kept safe within protection compliance laws and will take action to keep software safe when a potential breach is detected. DLP also offers other features that help to ensure data cannot be accessed by unauthorized people, while also giving organizations more visibility into their operations.\nDLP works with data loss prevention software that monitors data to help ensure it isn’t at risk of landing in the wrong hands, deliberately or otherwise. Data can be monitored at multiple locations such as in the cloud and at end-user points. When a potential breach is detected the data loss prevention software reacts. This typically includes alerts or encryptions that will make the data indecipherable.\nDLP software also provides reports that identify potential weaknesses in data loss prevention software processes. The reports ensure that organizations are keeping within the laws and regulations regarding DLP.\nDLP software is beneficial to businesses in several ways that can be broken down into 3 main categories:\nLosing sensitive data can be detrimental to any organization. There’s the potential for losing information that could be used by competitors to their benefit. If you lose sensitive data that belongs to customers then your reputation could be harmed which could cause you to lose customers. DLP software helps to prevent your data from being used against you and keeping your brand reputation intact.\nCompanies that hold sensitive data are bound by law to keep that data safe. Having DLP software installed can help companies to comply with these laws. Not only can DLP software help to prevent loss of data, it can also produce DLP reports for auditing purposes. These reports can demonstrate that the appropriate security measures are in place. The reports can also identify potential weaknesses in data loss prevention software and protocols that might otherwise be exploited.\nAn organization can learn a lot by tracking how data is being used within their organization. It might reveal individuals who are misusing the data, for example, allowing the company to act accordingly. It could also give valuable insights into how data is being used in your company.\nThe DLP market is expected to expand from around $1.64 billion in 2021, to $2.28 billion in 2023. Some of the reasons for this expected increase include:\nCloud computing is growing. More cloud-based platforms are being developed all the time, increasing their functionality and appeal. Some of the largest organizations on the planet are adopting cloud technology, along with countless smaller businesses. This means a lot more data that needs protecting, increasing the demand for DLP.\nData breaches are becoming increasingly frequent as more people look to access data – sometimes for illegal purposes. Some of the world’s biggest organizations have experienced data breaches, making it increasingly important that all data is protected with the most effective data loss prevention software available. DLP provides effective data loss prevention against all kinds of data breaches, including the most sophisticated hackers in the world.\nAs platforms develop, data that is increasingly valuable is accessed and used across the internet. Not only does sensitive data include things like your customers’ personal details, but also information on business methodologies and pricing models that competitors could use to their advantage.\nHackers are always on the lookout for vulnerabilities that could be exploited, so data loss prevention processes need to evolve simultaneously. DLP helps organizations keep up with changing compliance regulations to avoid penalties.\nChief Information Security Officers (CISOs) are taking a more prominent role in the workplace as businesses get up to date with technology. DLP gives CISOs the tools and information they require to do their job effectively and report to the CEO.\nAs internet-based systems become more functional, more data needs to be protected. DLP plays a valuable role in data protection because it supports keeping data safe. DLP provides more than barriers that keep data safe but also reports that ensure all protocols are compliant. Data loss prevention software also monitors for potential weaknesses in software and procedures.\nCompanies have a growing need to understand how data is being used, internally and externally. DLP provides valuable reports that give organizations a clearer picture of how their data is utilized, potentially giving them insights that enhance their business operations. DLP systems also provide more features as they evolve which makes them more valuable to the organizations they service.\nThese DLP industry safe practices should be put into action to maintain the integrity of your data:\nThere are 4 main DLP employment architectures that can be put in place. These are:\nEach DLP architecture type is designed to meet different objectives. For the best results, you establish what you hope to gain from using DLP software. Protecting your data is the most obvious objective, others include complying with regulations and gaining more visibility.\nThere are numerous data security solutions to choose from, with varying strengths and weaknesses. For maximum protection, choose a data loss prevention solution that is most relevant for your needs. This makes it necessary to evaluate all the data loss prevention software options that are available.\nFor DLP systems to be effective, you need to know which roles and responsibilities your employees have. You will need to know who should have access to what data, and put checks and balances in place to ensure that processes are followed. Roles and procedures should also be regularly evaluated to offer continuous protection of your data.\nDefine which metrics will tell you how successful the adoption of your DLP program is. Develop KPIs that can be shared with senior management to help highlight successes and potential gaps. Monitor your KPIs regularly and act on them whenever they identify room for improvement.\nDLP software incorporates some of the most advanced online security tools and features available. It helps keep your data safe by preventing accidental or criminal loss of data that could be very costly for your organization. DLP software offers insights into your organization’s personnel and operations and ensures that your organization remains legally compliant.

89	As a librarian, what criteria should I check for website authorship?	For website authorship, you should verify that the creator's name is clearly stated, sources of information are provided where needed, and there's a way for users to make comments or ask questions. The site manager should also be responsive to questions about copyright, trademark, or ownership of site materials.	"[""Sponsored by the\nASSOCIATION FOR LIBRARY SERVICE TO CHILDREN\na division of the\nAmerican Library Association\nYou are here\nGreat Websites for Kids Selection Criteria\nEstablished by the first ALSC Children and Technology Committee, 1997; revised by the ALSC Great Websites Committee/revisions approved by the ALSC Board of Directors, 2013\nThe Web is a lot like a flea market: there’s a vast selection of sites to choose from but not a lot of order to it. Some sites are offered by reputable “dealers” and some from individuals who want to show off their personal favorite items. Sometimes it’s hard to tell what’s a hidden treasure, and what’s a waste of time. It’s not hard to find sites if you use a search engine like Google, or a subject directory like Yahoo (or YahooKids!) A website domain can provide a hint about its content. Sites from commercial businesses usually include “.com”; federal government sites end in “.gov,” K12 school sites often include “k12” in the address, and college and university sites often include “.edu.” Sites from non-profit organizations often include “.org.”\nChildren’s librarians evaluate many types of media for children including books, audio books, e-books, videos, apps and websites. At this site, we have assembled a collection of websites that are noteworthy for excellence and appropriateness for young people, whom we define as children up to and including age fourteen. In making our selections, we consider the following points: authorship, purpose, design and content.\n•We recognize that each site we include here may not meet all of the criteria to be considered a great site; however, we will use our discretion to make the best choices possible.\n• We will be selective in choosing sites that offer reviews from other sources for any type of media. Sites must be consistent with the Library Bill of Rights.\n• The content on the Web changes faster than anything we have ever seen in our culture. Therefore, in any recommended list of Websites, the recommendations apply only to the primary sites that are listed, not to every site linked from the primary sites.\nA. Authorship/Sponsorship: Who Put up the Site?\n• The name of the individual or group creating the site should be clearly stated.\n• The creator should give a source for information in the site where necessary.\n• The Web site author or manager should provide a way for users to make comments or ask questions.\n• The Web site author or manager should be responsive to any questions regarding copyright, trademark, or ownership of all material on the site.

90	best place to put sewing machine in room with window natural light	When setting up a sewing machine in a room with natural light from a window, the optimal position is at a right angle to the window. This positioning ensures quilters have the necessary space to the left and rear of their sewing machine while benefiting from natural lighting.	['Organization tips for quilters by Linda Griffith\nDo you ever avoid quilting time because of the mess in your sewing space? As a professional organizer and avid quilter, I travel the country helping others organize their sewing spaces for optimum efficiency. I’d like to help you too!\nStart by understanding the space you have to work with. To do this, make a paper “pattern.”\nUsing ¼” graph paper, draw out the dimensions of your room with one square representing one square foot. Make sure you include the location and measurements of windows, doors, and closets. Remember to note if opening or closing doors blocks or hinders access to floor and wall space.\nNext, make paper “furniture.” Decide if you’ll use your existing furnishings or purchase new quilt-specific cabinets and storage units. Measure your existing or new furniture and draw to-scale representations of these on a second sheet of graph paper. Cut out these pieces so you can experiment with furniture “arrangement” without actually moving heavy pieces. Note where\nlarge doors or drawers open and table extensions take up space.\nIf the room has natural light coming from a window, try to position your sewing cabinet at a right angle to this light source. This position gives quilters needed space to the left and rear of their sewing machine. See the sidebar on artificial lighting.\nUsing your drawn room layout with noted light sources and paper “furniture,” try different arrangements, keeping the most-used items within easy reach and allowing enough room to move around your space in comfort. You’ll quickly realize which layout works best for you. The image to the left shows a sample before and after room layout.\nReorganizing means some level of throwing things out, so get ready by setting up several large tables in an adjacent space. Assemble three large boxes labeled Donate, Keep, and Toss. Gather some friends to help and you’re ready for action day!\nStart by emptying ALL of the contents of your sewing room onto the tables. You want everything out—even the furniture—so you can thoroughly clean. New flooring and repainting should be done now.\nSort all the items on the tables. When making choices, keep in mind the last time you used each item and whether you have duplicates. Working quickly, place each item into the labeled boxes. Don’t take time now to refold your fabrics.\nOnce your initial sort is complete, if the Keep box is overflowing and the Toss and Donate boxes are fairly empty, sort through the Keep box again.\nOnce you are satisfied with the sorting, the next task is to group like items you’re keeping. Label areas of the tables with wide masking tape and a black marker. Sections might be labeled books, patterns, thread, notions, embellishments, or fabric. Regroup the contents of the Keep box into their labeled areas on the tables.\nWhether to store fabric in closed or open systems depends on climate and personal preferences. Open, stackable wire shelving and drawers work well in humid areas. If you live in the desert, dust is a problem and clear, stackable plastic containers with lids are a better choice. Use the same brand and size for efficient stacking. Label the contents and never stack more than two containers per shelf.\nThink about what can be vertically mounted on your walls and still be in easy reach:\n- Hang rulers on peg board, wall hooks or vertical ruler racks; clip cutting mats to skirt hangars.\n- Use narrow wall spaces between doorways to mount vertical thread racks.\n- Store stabilizers in upright wine bottle racks.\n- Keep magazines in wall-mounted magazine racks.\n- Mount the TV, DVD player, and cable box to the wall.\nReferring to your drawn layout, start moving everything back into the room.\nThe photos below illustrate the before and after results from three of my previous clients.\nThese photos show the smallest sewing room I’ve ever organized, 7′ x 11′, with a 30″ recessed area.\nI placed a small banquet table into the room for a sewing table. Since the table had no drawers, I moved a tall bookshelf to the back wall, providing storage for sewing machine accessories directly behind the sewing area.\nCustom built-ins were created in the recess.\nThe upper cabinet has adjustable shelving with doors; the bottom has eight drawers with full-extension, ball-bearing runners. The countertop is customized to the owner’s height and serves as the cutting area.\nThere was no space to move around in the room shown in the bottom left. We created a floor plan, ordered a new sewing cabinet with a flipup rear extension and new closet shelving, and selected new flooring and paint. On action day, everything was spread out in the living room. The existing bookshelves were kept but reorganized to store the most used items in easy reach, as seen in the bottom right.\nThe new sewing cabinet has storage drawers and the rear extension is lowered when not in use. The closet holds containers neatly on adjustable shelves, as seen in the image below.\nNo matter what your room size or budget, there are improvements you can make. And the reward will be many more happy hours creating quilts!']	['<urn:uuid:9d063577-0a96-4847-866a-03b845c77b2a>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	12	48	868
91	what determines if word is mass or count noun	The distinction between mass and count nouns is determined by linguistic classification rather than the concepts themselves. While concepts like WATER and BOOK have different properties that influence their typical classification as mass or count nouns, what is classified as mass or count is the noun itself, not the underlying concept. However, the exact principles that determine why certain concepts favor different linguistic classifications (as mass or count nouns) remains an open question that needs further investigation.	"['Natural languages exploit a variety of means to encode the notional category ""plurality"". In the nominal domain, the grammatical and ontological distinction between pluralities and unities is a sharp one. Consider:\n(1) a. The class is noisy.\nb. The children are wearing red today.\nIn (1-a), ""class"", while notionally plural, refers to an atomic entity, or a set, or to the unity \'class\' whose members are students. Plural marking in (1-b) is used instead to refer to pluralities or multitudes. The ontological and logical status of a plurality or a multitude is still the object of debate, and the book adds to this debate interesting and highly innovative pieces of data and theory focusing mostly on grammatically marked pluralities as in (1-b).\n(2) a. The children are tall.\nb. The children are surrounding the garden.\nThe ability of plurals to combine with both the so-called distributive (2-a) and non-distributive predicates (2-b) (Godehard Link, 1983) points to the difficulty of determining the ontological and logical underpinnings of pluralities. While (2-a) describes each of the entities of the plurality separately, (2-b) describes the plurality as a whole, posing the question of whether the plurality, in this case, is to be conceived of and analyzed as a unity or a set, or whether one should endorse a different semantics, logic and ontology for plurals free of sets, mereological sums and unities altogether.\nThe unequivocal answer provided by this set of papers is that pluralities as sets are a misconception. The common goal of the collection is to show how to deal with plurality without ontologically and logically committing to higher order entities such as sets. The authors stand for pluralism versus singularism and versus predicative theory of plurality as a singularism in disguise. Singularisms are refuted in many ways, from logical to semantic perspectives. Bypassing the temptation to conceive of pluralities as unities, as in the combination of the plural with non-distributive predicates, the authors provide an intricate discussion of plurality as many and propose a variety of challenging accounts of this notion, which include exciting and promising excursions in the modal realm.\nSpecifically, Theodore Scaltas discusses the Platonic take on the question, arguing that in the Platonic view, pluralities are objects that partake in a Form. A property like ""two"" jointly qualifies the objects but does not relate them, just as ""beauty"" qualifies many objects at once. There is nothing peculiar to pluralities. Only those plurals that are relational seem to escape this view. Two individuals partake in the Form \'father of\', but only one of them is legitimately described as \'father\'. The treatment of these relational nouns is left to future research. Oystein Linnebo pursues the goal of saving Law V, according to which two open formulas φ(u) and ψ(u) define the same extension just in case they are true of the same objects, without incurring Russell\'s paradox, which arises from shifting individuals to sets of which these individuals are members. Linnebo\'s solution rests on the intriguing notion of possible sets. Alex Oliver and Timothy Smiley discuss in depth a variety of arguments against singularism and challenge predicative analyses (James Higginbotham and Barry Schein 1989) with a variety of objections, which include the notorious problem of multiplication of predicates for singular and plurals. By shifting the plural predicate to a predicate of a different order than the corresponding singular, predicates are necessarily doubled since no predicate can be of different orders simultaneously. Peter Simons develops a logic for multitudes with ontological innocence, by relying on the notion of difference. Like the previous authors, Francesca Boccuni, Massimiliano Carrara, and Enrico Martino claim ontological innocence for plurals, and defend a principle with universal applicability and cognitive primacy according to which there is no entity above those that form a plurality. Echoing the solution in Linnebo\'s paper, they also exploit a modal account by introducing arbitrary reference and free choiceness. The enterprise undertaken by these authors is a coherent one, and the notion of plurality as unity is shown to be unnecessary, misleading and disposable.\nLikewise, across the linguistic papers the notion of plurality itself is reduced to a minimum, that is to say nothing else above and beyond the elements that constitute it. Friederike Moltmann revises her previous notion of integrated whole (Moltmann, 2007) to defend the notion of plurality as many. Byeong-uk Yi notes two problems for generalized quantifier theory (so called Bach-Peters sentences and the donkey anaphora) and proposes a logic for plurals as many things as such that also pays attention to the varieties of methods used by natural language to express pluralities (e.g. all vs. any). Thomas J. McKay argues for distinguishing mass predication from plural predication, providing new arguments for disentangling the two. With an innovative take on the question of the ontological status of pluralities and the linguistic status of plurals, Paolo Acquaviva looks at pluralities as an effect of language rather than a matter of thought or even ontology. Following Hagit Borer (2005), Acquaviva argues for plurality as a classifier of natural language or as a divider and writes:\nMy proposal joins Borer\'s radically non-lexicalist claim that it is grammar that constructs and determines the part structure of a noun\'s reference domain, with the conception of kinds as underpinning the ontology presupposed by natural language. Kinds, under this view, are not secondary entities abstracted from particulars, but primary, underived entities in the ontology that underlies natural language semantics.\nAlexandra Arapinis tackles the question of collective responsibility, which also seems to plea for pluralities as unities (see Fred Landman 2000) to dissect the notion of a whole as integrated and consisting of parts functioning together. Across the variety of papers, the notion of plurality is dismissed from the ontological realm as an entity of its own right to be identified with its own members and ultimately to a category of natural language with no ontological substance.\nAlong this road a variety of questions are raised, many of which are left open, paving the way for new research. The most prominent one pertains to the individuation criteria for plurality. If a plurality is nothing beyond its elements, there must be nonetheless a principle guiding the speaker\'s choice of naming entities via a plural marker. Acquaviva, as just mentioned, considers kinds as primitives underpinning any use of grammatical plurals. No plurality needs to be individuated in the ontology to begin with since plurality is not a matter of being but a category of natural language and a means for classification in language. It is nonetheless to be acknowledged that natural language uses different determiners for count and mass nouns, and the question arises of the principles that ground such a linguistic fact. According to Acquaviva, concepts like WATER and BOOK are associated with different properties which favor their encapsulation as mass or count noun. By emphasizing that what is mass / count is not the concept but the noun, the question of what in the concept favors different linguistic encapsulation is not answered and the proposal seems to maintain a certain circularity.\nA series of papers points at modality as a possible and suitable candidate for spelling out the principles of individuation of pluralities, and seems to represent one of the most promising and newest advances of the collection as a whole.\nBoccuni, Carrara and Martino bring to light in the logical literature the notion of free choice (though without mentioning this explicitly), establishing a framework for fruitful comparison with the linguistic literature stemming from Nirit Kadmon and Landman 1993, Veneeta Dayal, 1998, and Anastasia Giannakidou, 2001 (to mention a few). Boccuni, Carrara and Martino develop the notion of the capability of an object of being picked by the ideal agent as underlying the notion of plurality as ontologically innocent. Their thesis also resonates with recent work on assertability conditions of universal quantifiers by Alda Mari and Christian Retoré (in press) who study a variety of universal quantifiers in natural language and point to a difference in their assertability conditions and the type of statements that host them. In particular Mari and Retoré argue that universal quantification via certain quantifiers (like tout in French) is possible only if entities can be chosen \'freely\' (in the technical sense). What counts as a plurality thus hinges on the method of choice of the entities that partake in the plurality, and different methods of choice can lead to individuate different types of pluralities (intensional and general vs. accidental and limited).\nIn spelling out the principles of individuation for wholes, Arapinis exploits the foundational notions of functional mereology: (i) the whole must possess some attribute in virtue of its status as a whole, (ii) the parts of the whole must stand in some special and characteristic relation of dependence, (iii) the whole must possess some kind of structure. By going back to the Gestalt concept of organic unities (see Peter Simons 1987) the notion of dependence is the principle for individuating wholes. As elaborated in Jacques Jayez and Mari (2005) and Mari (2003, 2005), who spells out the notion of dependence in a channel theoretic framework (Jon Barwise and Jerry Seligman, 1997), dependence can be rendered in terms of possible situations. The notion of modality is intrinsic to the one of dependent parts, and their link is still in need of more careful explorations.\nWithout clearly proposing a modal semantics, Linnebo also points to modal notions widening the borders of the notional category of plurality to possible entities. Going beyond possible individuals, this promising line of research will also seek to take into account perspectivization and the role of the cognitive agent in determining what counts in a context as a plurality or a multitude (see Mari 2005 on epistemic wholes). How knowledge and subjectivity enter the realm of plurality is a question to which the papers in the book lead, thus renewing the debate in a long-standing tradition that, since Plato, has still not entirely grasped what pluralities are and can be.\nBarwise, Jon and Seligman, Jerry 1997.

93	What are passport renewal requirements and how to prevent renewal scams?	Passport renewal by mail requires Form DS-82, current passport issued within 15 years, issued at age 16+, undamaged condition, and costs $110 for a passport book. You must ensure eligibility and submit through recommended USPS services with tracking. To prevent renewal scams, stay vigilant against fraudulent websites and unsolicited communications, verify website authenticity by checking domain names carefully, research company credibility through multiple reviews, look for ABTA membership verification, and never pay directly into private bank accounts. Always obtain proper documentation and be wary of offers that seem unusually cheap or pressure you to act quickly.	['USPS around the United States accepts first-time applicants as well renewals for passports for the US Department of State. Few of the locations can even take a photo for your passport. You can find the Find USPS Locations service to find certain passport services. Though some of the offices allow walk-ins for passport acceptance, others will need an appointment to provide services.\nThis article talks about the steps required for applying for different passports and their relevant information.\nFirst Step: Collect Necessary Documents Early\nIf you are applying for a passport for the first time, make sure that you apply a few months prior to your trip. You can choose to either apply through mail or go to the Post Office in person to apply. The United States State Department requires you to bring the following documents with you.\n- DS-11 application form\n- One 2”x2” color photo for the passport\n- Supporting documents for citizenship evidence and identification\n- Determined amount of fees\nSecond Step: Fill Out & Prepare the Documents\nThe US State Department website provides the following preparations for the mentioned documents.\n- Fill out the DS-11 Passport Application Form provided on the website of State Department\n- Print the filled-out application, however, do not put down your signature on it yet as an employee of the Post Office will need to see you write it\n- Take one passport photo according to the mentioned measurements (many of the offices can take your photo, so you can call them to enquire beforehand)\n- US Citizenship and identity document photocopy\n- Calculate and take the mentioned fees with you (Post Offices will accept money orders, checks, and credit cards as acceptance fees)\nThird Step: Look for a Post Office\nThere are specific hours at Post Offices for the passport services, and many of them will need an appointment. You can use USPS’s location tool on their website to locate a Post Office with passport services nearby.\nPost Offices have hours set specifically for all passport services. Most of these require people to book an appointment. Utilize the Find USPS Locations tool to get to the nearest Post Office that offers passport services. To use the tool, go to the Find USPS Locations on the USPS website. Then from the Location Types, select Passports and then enter an address or a ZIP code. Choose a range for mileage and then refine the search based of your preferences. (i.e. photos, appointment or walk-in) Finally click search to get your desired results.\nHow to Get A Passport at Urgent Basis?\nIf you require a first-time passport within two to three weeks, submit the application for passport at a Post Office and pay them for the expedited processing as well as the delivery service of one to two days for quicker return shipping. Follow these steps:\n- First prepare the necessary documents as directed in the second step\n- Then add the $60 fee for expedited fee which will go to the US Dept. of State\n- Priority Mail Express can be purchased for expediting delivery to the State Dept to process the application (the cost depends on the location)\n- Purchase the delivery service of one to two days for $16.48 to make shipping quicker\nIn the case you need your passport within two weeks, you have to apply at a passport agency of Department of State. You can call 1-877-487-2778 or set up an appointment online.\nFor first-time applications, there are two types of fees that need to be provided – the processing fee and the acceptance fee for the application. You will need to pay extra to take photos at the Post Office and/or processing the application faster.\nYou can pay the Post Office using credit or debit card, or through money order or cheque payable to “Postmaster”. The Post Office acceptance fee is $35 and the photo fee is $15. They send the payment for the State Dept. with the application and the payment is different from the fees of USPS. Remember that you cannot pay the State Dept. using debit or credit cards, and they accept only traveler’s, cashier’s, certified, and personal cheque that are payable to the “US Department of State”. They also take money order that you can purchase from a Post Office.\nThe specific fees are:\n- Passport Book – Form DS-11, Application Fee $110, Acceptance Fee $35\n- Passport Card – Form DS-11, Application Fee $30, Acceptance Fee $35\n- Passport Book & Card – Form DS-11, Application Fee $140, Acceptance Fee $35\nTo check the progress of your passport application, you can check on the website of the State Department after seven to ten business days of submitting your application at the Post Office. You can also call them for updates.\nRenew a Passport by Mail\nFirst Step: Prepare & Apply Early\nTo renew your passport, you will need to fill out the Application Form DS-82 of Passport Renewal. Unlike the DS-11 you don’t have to process or review your form through the Post Offices, and it can be directly mailed to the Department of State by the applicant.\n- There’s a 10yr validity of adult passports that can be renewed through mail\n- You cannot renew minor’s passports through mail\n- Many of the countries require the passport to be at least valid for six months\nSecond Step: Ensure Eligibility for Renewal\nYou are eligible for passport renewal through mail in the case you have the most current passport still.

Not only are people losing substantial sums of money but many holidays are being ruined, with people unable to afford a replacement. Over the past four years, we’ve joined forces with the City of London Police, Action Fraud and Get Safe Online to raise awareness of different types of holiday booking fraud and how you can avoid becoming a victim.\nWhat is holiday booking fraud and how to avoid the common types?\nHoliday booking fraud is when people hand over money only to discover the holiday, accommodation or flight they paid for doesn’t exist.\nFraudsters are conning unsuspecting holidaymakers and travellers out of millions of pounds each year or leaving them stranded with nowhere to stay.\nThe most common types of booking fraud are:\n- Holiday Accommodation: Fraudsters are making full use of the internet to con holidaymakers by setting up fake websites, hacking into legitimate accounts and posting fake adverts on websites and social media.\n- Airline tickets: Where a customer believes they are booking a flight and receives a fake ticket or pays for a ticket that never turns up.\n- Sports and religious trips: A popular target for fraud due to limited availability of tickets and consequently higher prices.\n- Timeshares and holiday clubs: The sums involved with this form of fraud are particularly high with victims losing typically thousands of pounds.\nTop tips to help avoid holiday booking fraud\n- Don’t reply to unsolicited emails, texts, social media or calls with holiday offers. Links and attachments in emails may lead to malicious websites or download viruses.\n- Stay safe online: Check the web address is legitimate and has not been altered by slight changes to a domain name – such as going from .co.uk to .org.\n- Do your research: Don’t just rely on one review – do a thorough online search to ensure the company is credible. If they’re suspect, other people may well have posted their experiences warning people off.\n- Look for the logo: Check whether the company is an ABTA Member. Look for the ABTA logo on the company’s website and if you have any doubts, verify membership by visiting our ABTA Member search. If you’re booking a flight and want more information about ATOL protection, or would like to check whether a company is an ATOL holder, then please visit the CAA website.\n- Pay safe: Never pay directly into an private individuals bank account.\n- Check the paperwork: You should study receipts, invoices and terms and conditions, and be very wary of any companies that don’t provide any at all. When booking through a Holiday Club or Timeshare, get the contract thoroughly vetted by a solicitor before signing up.\n- Use your instincts: If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\n- Get free expert advice: For further advice on how to stay safe when booking or researching travel online, go to Get Safe Online.\nHow to report it']	['<urn:uuid:54c00532-cbd6-46ba-a02b-7b941669e6a8>', '<urn:uuid:926a7928-4e4a-42cf-bc58-badd5c26cdb1>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	11	96	1911

95	How do CEFR levels connect to vocabulary learning tools?	The CEFR's six levels (A1-C2) are integrated into language learning tools. The Word Family Framework (WFF) arranges over 22,000 vocabulary items according to these CEFR levels, while Clarity English and Road to IELTS provide ICT resources aligned with these standards for improving specific language areas.	['It shows how words within the same family are placed at different levels and is aimed at teachers who can use it to plan courses, syllabi and lessons. The WFF is the product of an ELT reasearch award and was designed by Richard West.\nWhat is the Word Family Framework (WFF)?\nThe WFF is a searchable resource for teachers and learners of English that consists of over 22,000 vocabulary items arranged according to six levels aligned to the Common European Framework of Reference.\nWhat can the WFF be used for?\nThe WFF can be used by institutions, teachers and learners to construct target vocabularies for individual learning, syllabus and lesson planning, materials design and exam preparation. It can be used for two different types of vocabulary selection:\n- Identifying all the vocabulary items at one CEFR level.\n- Identifying all the vocabulary items at several CEFR levels.\n- Identifying the CEFR level of an individual word or group of words.\n- Identifying the CEFR levels of all the members of a word family in order to decide which items may be worth learning.\n- Identifying unknown members of word families in order to extend a learner’s vocabulary.\nHow can the WFF be searched?\nThe WFF can be searched in three main ways:\n1. For horizontal searches to look for a particular word or item, type the term you are looking for in the search box:\n2. For vertical searches to find all the items at one or more CEFR levels, tick () all the CEFR levels you want:\n3. To download the complete WFF, click the Download box:\nHow does the WFF link to the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR)?\nThe CEFR includes statements about the vocabulary range of a learner at each of six levels, A1 to C2:\nThe CEFR’s descriptors make quantitative statements about the learner’s vocabulary repertoire at each level, but stop short of stating how large this repertoire might be at each level, or which vocabulary items would be appropriate for each level. However, the CEFR invites users of the Framework to `consider and where appropriate state:\n- which lexical elements (fixed expressions and single word forms) the learner will need/be equipped/be required to recognise and/or use;\n- how they are selected and ordered.’\nIt is just this selection and ordering of lexical elements that the WFF offers to users.\nHow large is the WFF?\nThe WFF includes more than 22,000 words and vocabulary items. It starts with a list of some 6000 of the most common and useful headwords, arranged alphabetically for easy access. Most headwords provide the starting point for a word family, which includes the cognates, derivatives and compounds which make up the family. All family members are then presented across a number of levels, so that the relative value of each item may be quickly determined. The approximate numbers of headwords and the vocabulary items generated can be seen in this table:\nHow were the words in the WFF chosen?\nThe vocabulary items presented in the WFF have been chosen from a survey of a large number of published sources and word lists produced in the UK, USA, Germany, Europe and China. These lists vary in size and function, and the items in the lists were selected according to differing criteria. The research that preceded the development of the WFF therefore began by surveying these lists in detail to identify the levels of agreement between these different sources. In this way, the WFF presents a consensus of views about the level of each vocabulary item.\nHow does the WFF differ from dictionaries and word lists?\nTraditionally, dictionaries and word lists present lexical items in alphabetical order. The WFF, however, presents words in word families. Each family may include items that depart from strict alphabetical order. So, for example, the family value includes words such as devalue, evaluate and invaluable, which would be widely separated from value, valuable and valueless in a conventional dictionary or list. They are presented together here because it is widely believed that seeing words as members of a family rather than in isolation promotes effective vocabulary learning:\nWhat is column X and how do I use it?\nAs can be seen here, in addition to the six levels aligned to the CEFR, the WFF includes a column X. This column includes extra members of word families which are either a) off the A1–C2 scale, or b) not included in the main scale because there is insufficient information in the research data. It presents items of various kinds:\nLearners and teachers may select from column X the items which they find useful and easy to learn or teach. In this way, the WFF allows users not only to select vocabulary at a particular level (vertical searching), but also to look across levels at items within the same family (horizontal searching).\nWhat does the WFF not include?\nThe WFF includes a wide range of over 22,000 items of English vocabulary. It covers both British and American English, with variant spellings (honour/honor) and variant terms (lift/elevator). However, it is a framework of general English and so it does not include vocabulary items from academic, business, scientific or technical English. Neither does it include dialect or obsolete words found outside the common core of British or American English.\nCan I adapt the WFF to my own context?\nIt is recognized that the WFF may not be fully appropriate for all learners or all learning situations. For this reason, the WFF will incorporate an interactive dimension, and users are invited to discuss their views and the ways they use the WFF with the British Council and other users in the WFF discussion forum (click for access). Our intention is that this discussion will lead to the introduction of a facility which will enable users to download and adapt the WWF to their particular local contexts.\nThe WFF was developed for the British Council by Richard West, who would like to acknowledge the contributions made by Dr Wendy Scarlin and Mrs Judy Hermitte.\nC countable (noun)\nI intransitive (verb)\nnC countable noun\nnCU countable and uncountable noun\nnpl plural noun\nnU uncountable noun\nphr v phrasal verb\nT transitive (verb)\nU uncountable (noun)\nvI intransitive verb\nvIT transitive and intransitive verb\nvT transitive verb\nTo use the Word Family Framework, follow the link below or click here.', 'Clarity English publishes effective, enjoyable, easy-to-use ICT for English.It help the students to improve specific language areas including Grammar, Vocabulary, IELTS practice, reading, writing, speaking and listening skills.

96	How do successful project managers handle team communication challenges, and what privacy safeguards should they implement when using collaborative tools?	Project managers need to create an environment of collaboration through processes like incorporating icebreakers in kickoff meetings and building communication structures within projects. When issues arise, like team members requesting more time, managers should investigate the root cause and implement appropriate fixes such as adding team members or negotiating with stakeholders. Regarding privacy safeguards with collaborative tools, they must verify that apps clearly state their data collection practices, check for GDPR/COPPA compliance, ensure encryption of sensitive information, and confirm the ability to remove personal data. They should also consider de-identification practices for analyzing user behavior and team performance data.	['A project manager interview can be intimidating, especially if you don’t know what to expect. The good news is that going through some common questions can help a lot to be (and feel) prepared. Though all interviews are different, it’s likely that you’ll encounter questions that ask about your people skills, technical knowledge, and specific situations.\nWhat is a project manager?\nA project manager is a professional who organizes, plans, and executes projects while working within restraints like budgets and schedules. Project managers are in charge of leading teams, defining goals, communicating with stakeholders, and seeing a project through to its closure. Whether running a marketing campaign, constructing a building, developing a computer system, or launching a new product, the project manager is responsible for the success or failure of the project.\nThe project manager role is in demand in just about every industry. Let’s take a closer look at what project managers do, why you should consider a career in project management, and how you can get started.\nWhat does a project manager do? Tasks and responsibilities\nA project is typically divided into five different phases: initiation, planning, execution, and closure.\nThroughout the lifecycle of a project, the project manager is responsible for:\n- Defining the scope of the project\n- Staying on schedule\n- Planning a project’s cost and sticking to a budget\n- Managing project resources (including teams and workers)\n- Documenting the progress of the project\n- Communicating with stakeholders\n- Assessing risks\n- Leading quality assurance\nThe sheer variety of tasks means no two days on the job (or two projects) are quite the same. On any given day, you might be interviewing and hiring new talent, managing team meetings, reallocating resources to cover an unexpected expense, or updating stakeholders on the progress of the project.\nLearn more about the lifecycle of a project in this video.\nProject management interview questions\nHere are a few common interview questions you’ll encounter as a project manager. You can use this list as a starting off point to prepare stories about your past experiences.\nTell me about yourself.\nA common question to open any type of interview, this statement is a chance for you to describe yourself and your story in your own words.\nHow to answer: There are several ways you can approach this question. One effective way is to start with the present, then go into your past, and finish with your future. Describe what your role is, and what you do. Then describe past experiences relevant to the role you’re applying to. Finally, talk about what kind of work you’re hoping to do next, and why you’re interested in the role you’ve applied to.\nCan you tell us about the last project you worked on?\nAn interview might ask you about your last project to get a sense of what types of projects you’re used to, what project management approaches you’ve used, the number of people on your team, and other details.\nHow to answer: Describe the important information about the project, like the overall goal, team size, and how you approached it. Speak candidly about what went well, and be sure to mention something you might have improved or that you learned. Having some metrics on hand to show the results of the project can be useful here.\nTell us about a time something went wrong in a project you were managing.\nSetbacks are normal in managing projects. Hiring managers will want to know how you’ve dealt with them in the past to understand what you do when things don’t go according to plan.\nHow to answer: Since dealing with unforeseen challenges is a core part of project management, you’ll want to have a few examples to point to for your interview. You can also mention how you would implement change processes in your project.\nConsider using the STAR method when asked for specific examples from your past. Here’s how to put the method into action:\n- Situation: Start by describing the facts of the situation and why it happened—in this case, what had gone wrong.\n- Task: Go on to describe what task you were expected to do to solve the situation.\n- Action: Next, explain what you did, and how you did it.\n- Result: Finish by sharing the outcome. Also describe what you learned from the experience.\nHow do you prioritize tasks in a project?\nKnowing what to prioritize is key to a project. There’s a chance you’ll receive a question asking what you decide to prioritize, and why. You might also be asked how you would juggle working on multiple projects at once.\nHow to answer: Tie your answer back to the interest of the project. Your answer might include some combination of deadlines, stakeholder needs, or determining tasks that make up a critical path. You can pull from some examples in the past, or work your way through some hypothetical situations.\nWhat was your most successful project?\nThis question can demonstrate to recruiters what you consider a success. Projects can be successful for meeting goals, deadlines, and budgets, but successes can also mean being able to incorporate change.\nHow to answer: Take this opportunity to demonstrate your strengths. Modesty is a great asset, but don’t undersell yourself. If your team pulled out a success, what did you do to keep the project on track or be more efficient? Think about the key elements you and the team took that led to success.\nWhat’s your experience with budget management?\nHiring managers might ask questions specifically about various skills like budget management. It’s probably not a deal breaker if you have no experience in most cases—they may just be trying to get a better sense of where you stand.\nHow to answer: Managing a budget includes cost estimation, deciding how to allocate funds, keeping a record of how money was spent, and planning for unexpected expenses. It’s great if you can point to some examples in the past. If you don’t have much experience, you can share what you know about budget planning, or talk about budgeting experience you have in your personal life, if it’s relevant. It’s also good to show that you’re able to pick up new skills.\nHow would you describe a project plan?\nAn interviewer can try to gauge your technical knowledge of basic project management concepts.\nHow to answer: Start by answering the question—describe what elements you know to be an important part of a project plan (like tasks, milestones, and team members). You can then go into an example of how you’ve typically implemented them in the past.\nHow would you create an environment of collaboration on your team?\nKnowing how to motivate team members and make them feel like they can surface any questions and concerns is often central to a project’s success.\nHow to answer: In this situation, it can be helpful to point to an example of when you were able to foster good communication in your team. Think about any processes or methods you rely on to get people feeling like they are working toward a common goal. This might include simple methods like incorporating ice breakers in kickoff meetings, or building in communication structures within a project.\nWhat tools do you use to plan a project?\nInterviewers might want to get a sense of how familiar you are with different project management tools.\nHow to answer: In preparing for your interview, make a list of all the project management tools you’ve used before. These can include common project management tools like RACI charts, or collaboration software like Asana or Trello. Mention what you like about them, and how they might be improved.\nDo some research to see if you can find what kind of tools you’ll be expected to use. You can try to familiarize yourself with the tool, or see if you’ve used any similar tools. These Guided Projects on Coursera are free, can be completed in two hours or less, and can introduce you to some common project management tools:\nDescribe your experience in this industry.\nFamiliarize yourself as much as you can with the company’s industry before the interview. Learn what the top issues are by reading news articles and listening to podcasts, or reaching out to project managers in similar roles and asking about their experiences.\nHow to answer: Come prepared to talk about any experience you’ve had in the industry. Academic or professional background is great. If you don’t have these, you can talk about what you’ve learned about the industry, and why you want to work in it. Mention any skills or knowledge that are transferable as well.\nWhat if I don’t have any formal project management experience?\nProject management is a field where people skills can make or break a candidate. If you’re less familiar with the technical side of project management, emphasize people skills you have like leadership, communication, and organization. Even if you’re not a formal project manager yet, chances are good that you’ve done some elements of project management in the past. Go through your experiences and find moments when you’ve helped to improve, plan, or execute new processes.\nAnd don’t worry—if you’ve landed an interview, your interviewer probably already knows that you don’t have formal experience but sees potential in you. Convey your enthusiasm for the job and willingness to learn.\nOne of your team members is asking for more time to complete a task. How would you handle this situation?\nSituational questions like these are common in project management interviews. This is a chance for hiring managers to see your thought process and gauge how you think on your feet.\nHow to answer: As a project manager, you’ll be expected to help team members that haven’t been able to complete tasks on schedule in the interest of the project. You’ll want to know why the issue arose in the first place, and apply an appropriate fix. You might talk about adding another member if the team is feeling overloaded, implementing time buffers in the planning phase for certain tasks, or negotiating with a stakeholder for more time or resources.\nHow would you deal with a difficult stakeholder?\nThis situational question aims to get clarity into your people skills, a crucial part of being a successful project manager.\nHow to answer: Communication and negotiation are likely to be an important part of your answer here.

This is true for students and adults alike. If we find an app that looks like it will meet a need, we typically install it without considering what we might be giving up. Here are five questions to ask before installing apps, and then we’ll look at several helpful resources to expand your understanding of the critical nature of data privacy.\n|Q1:||Does the app developer clearly state what data they collect and how they use that data on its website?|\n|Q2:||Does the app developer share what permissions are granted to use the app BEFORE installing the app?|\n|Q3:||Does the app identify a relatively recent date of its last update?|\n|Q4:||Does the app developer give information on their website if they handle data in accordance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)?|\n|Q5:||Does the app developer allow you to request that your personal data be removed?|\nIf you realize that these five questions reveal you need to brush up on data privacy concerns, here are some resources to help bring you up to speed. These resources make the biggest impact when you provide opportunities for discussion with peers, parents, and leaders in your school/district.\nData Quality Campaign\nThe Data Quality Campaign (DQC) is a national nonprofit policy and advocacy organization dedicated to ensuring that education data works for individuals, families, educators, communities, and policymakers. They provide many helpful resources that you might consider sharing with your peers, parents, and leaders in your district.\nEncryption is a common method often used to protect sensitive student information. Encryption is a common security practice, but privacy policies rarely mention it. Most commonly, encryption is mentioned in connection with billing information. Without examining its policy, there is no way to tell which data a service encrypts. De-identification is another important aspect of student data privacy on apps. Almost half of the privacy policies mention de-identification as a primary reason for collecting data. These policies are almost exclusively used for analyzing user behavior and reporting on student performance within districts.\nIf you are looking for more information or need help, go to Terms of Service; Didn’t Read. They may have reviewed the app already. If not, you can submit a request to help answer your question.\nParental Responsibility in Data Privacy\nParental responsibility for student privacy is a crucial responsibility. In addition to protecting their children’s privacy, parents must educate themselves about the technology their children are using. If parents allow their children to use technology without parental supervision, they could be agreeing to data tracking. In addition to educating themselves, parents should always check the privacy practices of the websites and apps they use. By ensuring these services are transparent about their data collection practices, parents can rest assured that their children’s privacy is protected.\nParents who want to learn more about taking a proactive role in protecting children’s privacy can go to one of these sites for relevant help.\n- Connect Safely – A nonprofit dedicated to educating users of connected technology about safety, privacy, and security. You can easily explore information sorted by topics and access quick guides, news, and podcasts on their website.\n- Parent Coalition for Student Privacy – This coalition focuses on being advocates with parents in helping keep their child’s data safe. Check out their website for an interactive state student privacy report card, an educator toolkit, and a parent toolkit.\n- The Education Cooperative – Helpful information to support parents in understanding legal issues such as COPPA, PPRA, CIPA, and FERPA and how it relates to the safety of their child.\nTeachers, too, need to educate themselves about the privacy practices of third-party developers. Connecticut has passed a law establishing a task force to study student data privacy on apps. The task force will explore whether local boards of education should adopt data contracting policies, and they will train employees on best practices. The law will also develop a list of websites and software approved by the state and approved by school districts. By providing more information about the privacy practices of third-party providers, parents will feel more comfortable with these platforms.\nEach district is responsible for managing student data generated within the school environment and on school devices. The following points can help teachers know how they play a critical role in ensuring student safety. Ignorance of your responsibilities as an educator does not protect you. Seek out the information to be an informed and proactive educator and advocate for your students.\n- Contact your Technology Department and ask where they provide training for educators on digital citizenship, student online safety, and best practices in relation to using apps and digital devices in the classroom.\n- Contact your Professional Development Department (or HR) to find out what resources are available to help teachers better understand their role when using technology with students.\n- Contact your local educational service center (or state education association) for information on student data privacy they’ve already prepared and made available. Sometimes this is posted on their respective websites; sometimes, you will need to call and track down the person with the information.\nWhile most students are comfortable sharing their social-emotional learning survey results, they may be less comfortable sharing their social-emotional learning results with a school or other third party, for example. Regardless of the level of privacy concerns, a student’s privacy is the most important thing parents, teachers, schools, and he or she can protect.']	['<urn:uuid:e9f00a0f-d4d6-4f02-9009-d51e12ef4b4a>', '<urn:uuid:d19cfadf-652c-45a3-9a03-cff466680729>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	20	99	2710
97	how many times reused rocket booster latest spacex satellite deployment mission	The Falcon 9's first stage booster completed its seventh flight, which included launches of a GPS 3 satellite, the Turksat 5A communications satellite and five Starlink missions.	['WASHINGTON — SpaceX launched another set of Starlink satellites April 28, its first since the FCC approved a modification that allows the company to operate more satellites in lower orbits.\nThe Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 11:44 p.m. Eastern. The rocket’s upper stage deployed its payload of 60 Starlink satellites into low Earth orbit nearly 65 minutes later.\nThe launch took place a day after the Federal Communications Commission approved SpaceX’s request to modify its Starlink constellation. The modification will move 2,814 satellites originally approved for launch in orbits of 1,100 to 1,300 kilometers to orbits of 540 to 570 kilometers, similar to the 550-kilometer orbits used by existing Starlink satellites.\nSpaceX did not mention the FCC’s decision in its webcast. However, it did discuss how it chose lower orbits for spaceflight safety, ensuring that satellites will deorbit within several years of the end of their lives. It also mentioned its work with the 18th Space Control Squadron, sharing data on the orbits of Starlink satellites for collision avoidance activities, as well as a recent agreement with NASA to coordinate maneuvers between Starlink and NASA spacecraft in low Earth orbit.\n“We are extremely proud of our efforts to not only provide internet access to the disconnected, but also ensure space remains a place where human spaceflight continues to grow,” Jessie Anderson, host of the webcast, said.\nWith this launch, SpaceX has now placed 1,505 Starlink satellites into orbit, of which 1,434 remain in orbit. The company was approaching its previous authorization of 1,584 satellites in 550-kilometer orbits when the FCC approved its license modification to allow more satellites in those lower orbits.\nThe Falcon 9’s first stage landed on a droneship in the Atlantic about eight and a half minutes after launch. The booster completed its seventh flight, which included launches of a GPS 3 satellite, the Turksat 5A communications satellite and five Starlink missions.\nSpaceX has been using the Starlink launches to push the limits of reusability of the Falcon 9 first stage. “There doesn’t seem to be any obvious limit to the reusability of the vehicle,” Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX, said at an April 23 NASA press conference after the Crew-2 launch. “We do intend to fly the Falcon 9 booster until we some kind of a failure with the Starlink missions, have that be a life-leader.”\nMusk’s comments came after the first launch of a reused Falcon 9 first stage on a crewed mission. The Crew-2 launch used the same first stage that flew the Crew-1 mission the previous November.\nMusk said he and NASA have discussed what the optimal number of launches of a booster might be. “Do you want to be on a brand-new booster?” he asked. “You probably don’t want to be on the life leader for a crewed mission, but it’s probably good to have a flight or two under its belt.” He suggested a “couple of flights” might be best for a booster launching a crewed mission.\n“It’s a hard problem for a rocket,” he said of reusability.\nSpaceX also used the launch to honor Michael Collins, the Apollo 11 astronaut who died earlier that day at the age of 90. “Godspeed Apollo 11’s Michael Collins,” the SpaceX launch director said as the rocket lifted off. “May the pursuit of exploration live on.”']	['<urn:uuid:1ba38184-671a-4ff2-97bd-02117692561b>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	11	27	567
98	temple jerusalem timeline construction completion dates	The Temple construction spanned multiple periods. The sanctuary building began in 19 BC and took 46 years to complete, finishing around 28 AD. The Western Wall's construction started later, around 17/18 AD based on discovered coins, and was completed during the reign of either Agrippa I (41-44 AD) or Agrippa II (48-66 AD). Construction throughout the temple complex continued until 62 AD, just four years before its destruction. The original Temple construction under Solomon took seven years to complete, starting in his fourth year of reign.	['1 Kings 6 Modern English Version (MEV)\nSolomon Builds the Temple\n6 In the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv (which is the second month), he began to build the house of the Lord.\n2 The house which King Solomon built for the Lord had a length of sixty cubits, a width of twenty cubits, and a height of thirty cubits.[a] 3 The porch in front of the temple was twenty cubits[b] in length, the same as the width of the house, and ten cubits[c] deep in front of the house. 4 He made beveled windows for the house. 5 He also built a structure against the wall of the house, running around the walls of the house, both of the temple and of the inner sanctuary, and he made side chambers all around. 6 The lowest story was five cubits[d] broad, the middle one was six cubits[e] broad, and the third was seven cubits[f] broad. For around the outside of the house, he made offsets on the wall so that the supporting beams should not be inserted into the walls of the house.\n7 The house was built of stone prepared at the quarry, so that neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron was heard in the house while it was being built.\n8 The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house, and it had winding stairs into the middle chamber and out of the middle into the third. 9 So he built the house and finished it and covered it with beams and boards of cedar. 10 Then he built chambers against the whole house, five cubits high, and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.\n11 Now the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying, 12 “Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk in My statutes and execute My judgments and keep all My commandments and walk in them, then I will carry out My word with you, which I spoke to David your father, 13 and I will dwell among the people of Israel and will not forsake My people Israel.”\n14 So Solomon built the house and finished it. 15 He built the interior walls of the house with boards of cedar. From the floor of the house to the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with planks of fir. 16 He lined twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls, with boards of cedar, and he even lined them within, even the inner sanctuary and the Most Holy Place. 17 The house, that is, the nave in front of the inner sanctuary, was forty cubits[g] long. 18 The cedar of the house within had carvings of gourds and open flowers. All was cedar. There was no stone seen.\n19 He prepared the inner sanctuary in the inner part of the house in order to set there the ark of the covenant of the Lord. 20 The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high. He overlaid it with pure gold. He also overlaid the altar of cedar. 21 So Solomon overlaid the interior of the house with pure gold, and he made a partition with gold chains in front of the inner sanctuary, and he overlaid it with gold. 22 He overlaid the whole house with gold as well as the whole altar that was by the inner sanctuary.\n23 Within the inner sanctuary, he made two cherubim from olive wood, each ten cubits high. 24 One wing of the cherub was five cubits, and the other wing was also five cubits. From the furthest part of the one wing to the furthest part of the other was ten cubits. 25 The other cherub was ten cubits. Both the cherubim were the same shape and size. 26 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was that of the other cherub. 27 He set the cherubim within the inner sanctuary, and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubim, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall, and their wings touched one another in the middle of the house. 28 He overlaid the cherubim with gold.\n29 He carved all the walls of the house with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers both inside and out. 30 He overlaid the floor of the house with gold, both inside and out.\n31 For the entrance to the inner sanctuary, he made doors of olive wood; the lintel and doorposts were five-sided. 32 The two doors were also made of olive wood. He carved on them cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubim and upon the palm trees. 33 So also he made for the entrance to the nave four-sided posts of olive wood. 34 The two doors were made from fir tree, with two leaves of each door folding. 35 He carved on them cherubim and palm trees and open flowers and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.\n36 He built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone and a row of cedar beams.\n37 In the fourth year, in the month Ziv, the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid, 38 and in the eleventh year, in the month Bul (which is the eighth month), the house was completely finished. All the details and plans were met. So he took seven years to build it.', 'Israeli archaeologists have discovered an unusual stone among the many making up the Western Wall in Jerusalem. The Western Wall is the only remaining structure of the Second Temple that was lavishly refurbished by Herod. The stone in question was discovered beneath the soil at the lowest foundations of the Wall. What’s so unusual about it? All the large stone blocks used in the Western Wall are ‘bossed’ masonry. That is, they have a carved margin around the edges that give the blocks a sense of depth. But this one particular stone lacks the margin, making it unique.\nSo the question is why is this one stone block unbossed, and why was it buried amongst the foundations of the Western Wall? Israeli archaeologist Eli Shukron has a theory:\nThis stone came from the Temple Mount, from the surplus stones that were used in the construction of the Temple itself. Those stones were high-quality, chiseled and smooth, like this unusual one, which was discovered among the Western Wall’s foundations. This stone was intended for the Second Temple, and stones like it were used to build the Temple — but it was left unused. The builders of the Western Wall brought it down here because it was no longer needed up above — and this is how the other stones of the Temple looked,” he says, adding, “Anyone who passes a hand gently over this stone feels a slightly wavy texture, just like the Talmud describes.\nIn other words, Shukron believes that this stone block was originally meant to be part of the actual temple sanctuary building—the heart of the entire temple complex.\nIs Shukron’s theory plausible?\nHere are a few points on which to reflect:\n- As the report on Israel Hayom states, Shukron ‘led the Antiquities Authority’s effort to expose the foundations of the Western Wall in the Jerusalem Archaeological Park, an effort that was funded by the Elad non-profit organization.’ Elad, also known as the Ir David Foundation, exists for the purpose of strengthening the Jewish connection to Jerusalem. In other words, it is not a scholarly organisation, but a political one. The interpretation of finds that come from Elad-sponsored efforts must bear this political aim in mind, and realise that there is almost always an alternative interpretation. In this particular case, interpreting a stone block as being from the temple sanctuary building could easily be seen as a political claim to the Temple Mount, which currently hosts the Islamic holy places of the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque.\n- It seems clear now that the Western Wall was not built during the reign of Herod himself. As Shukron and his colleague, Ronny Reich, observe, coins found in the soil used to cover the structures over which the Western Wall was built were minted in the time of Valerius Gratus, the Roman Prefect of Judea from AD 15–26 (the predecessor of Pontius Pilatus). In fact, the coins can be pinpointed to AD 17/18, giving us a date for the beginning of construction at the Western Wall. Shukron and Reich argue the wall was then completed in the time of Agrippa I (AD 41–44) or Agrippa II (48–66). However, the sanctuary building at the top of the temple complex was begun by Herod long before this in 19 BC. John 2.20 states that the temple took 46 years to build. This probably refers to the building of the sanctuary itself rather than the entire complex. Construction throughout the complex continued right up until AD 62—just four years before the outbreak of the Jewish Revolt would eventually see the destruction of the temple complex. So if the sanctuary took 46 years to build, and began in 19 BC, we can date its completion to AD 28. This overlap allows the possibility that a stone intended for use in the sanctuary ended up buried with the foundations of the Western Wall. Shukron’s theory is possible.\n- As possible as Shukron’s theory is, a key question is why more such stones have not been found. Is it possible that there was a surplus of only one single stone block from the materials used to build the sanctuary? Could surplus stones not have been used in other peripheral structures around the temple complex? Eilat Mazar, director of the City of David excavations, says, “It is hard to construct a theory on the basis of a single stone. If another stone or two like it should be found in the future — and that could happen — that will be a somewhat stronger basis for Shukron’s theory that the stone came from a surplus that had been intended for the Temple of the type that had been used to build it.”\n- Shukron notes the high quality of the stone when surmising it came from the temple building. Yet perhaps it came from another building within the temple complex, rather than from the sanctuary building itself. After all, the temple complex was enormous and, well, complex. There were numerous courtyards, rooms, and gates throughout it. There is every possibility that the stone had been intended for use in one of these peripheral structures.\n- Another plausible theory is that the stone in question was a surplus block not from the sanctuary at the top of the complex, but from the Western Wall itself. Perhaps the stone was not needed in the construction of the wall, and so the masons did not bother carving the bossed effect, and ended up burying it rather than trying to haul it elsewhere. These were, after all, giant blocks of stone that took considerable effort to move in a pre-mechanised world.\nSo have we found a stone from the temple sanctuary in Jerusalem? Maybe, but we just can’t be sure because at present we have no way to corroborate or falsify the claim. What is almost certain is that it derives from the temple complex as a whole, but the stone’s original purpose is debatable. If we had some other stones from the temple sanctuary itself, we would be able to make direct comparison. But such a comparison is currently impossible. Our dilemma reminds us of the words of one particular Jewish figure who lived at the time of the temple’s construction: ‘Do you see these great constructions? Not one stone will be left here on another that will not be demolished!’ (Mark 13.2)\nQuotes and information about the recent find came from Israel Hayom.\nHT also to Antonio Lombatti.']	['<urn:uuid:a935ff0a-6278-4bc5-9177-3d1c9d203442>', '<urn:uuid:67377485-7e0e-4c18-ab69-785881e07d7a>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	6	86	2062
99	How does hospital ER triage system prioritize different patient levels?	Hospitals use a 5-level triage system. Level 1 patients are most critical, requiring immediate CPR or life-saving intervention. Level 2 patients need attention within 15 minutes, with abnormal vitals or life-threatening conditions. Level 3 patients (like those with abdominal pain, high fevers, or broken bones) typically wait longest. Levels 4 and 5 are stable patients needing minimal testing, usually seen in 'fast track' areas within an hour.	['Hospital ER, Freestanding ER, or Urgent Care- How to choose the right care.\nLet’s say your child has a high fever, things are getting worse and you need quick medical attention. Where do you take them?\nIf you go to urgent care your provider might suggest you be transferred to an ER for higher level of care. You can’t afford to pay for two sets of bills, but your child needs medical attention now. What do you do?\nMany people base their decision on cost. Both hospitals and Freestanding ERs can handle everything that an urgent care can, but that “one-stop shop” convenience usually comes with a hefty price tag.\nWhile there are many sides to this debate, there are some solid guidelines that can help you determine which venue is best for your acute medical need.\nChoosing Between an ER and Urgent Care\nFreestanding ERs and Hospital ERs both provide great emergency care. The biggest decision is when to choose an ER versus an urgent care. Really, price can’t factor into this call. The decision should be driven only by the severity of the medical problem. If there is a definite medical emergency call 911 or go to your nearest emergency room. Serious bleeding, head injuries, major fractures, ingestion of poison, chest pain, stroke like symptoms – these types of conditions all need immediate and serious attention and there is no substitute for the ER in these circumstances.\nHospital ERs are a trusted and reliable choice, but as we know they are not always convenient and they definitely are not cheap. The good news is that According to an independent survey, only 1/3rd of people attending an E.R needed actual emergency care! If you know loss of a limb or life are not on the line, spare your pocket book. There are better choices out there.\nSo What are Urgent Care Centers For?\nUrgent Care Centers bridge the gap between the services provided in an emergency room and services provided in a primary care physician office. They treat a broad range of acute, but minor medical conditions. Examples include, cough, fever, sore throat, urinary infections, and ankle sprains. They often provide flu shots and school physicals as well. The majority of urgent care centers are open 7 days per week and appointments are not required. Wait times vary, but are generally shorter than at a hospital ER. Most all are open until 8 or 9 pm and some as late as 11pm. They are usually staffed by mid-level providers or family care physicians. They can provide most of the same services available in a local physician’s office with the addition of onsite labs and x-ray machines. They usually do not have the specialized medical equipment or emergency trained doctors needed for life-threatening medical conditions. Cost is the biggest benefit here. They often offer cash-pay options if you do not have insurance and most are in-network with major insurance plans. This means they have a contract with your insurance company so there are no surprise battles to fight later.\nFreestanding versus Hospital Based ERs\nWhether you have a cold or have suffered a gunshot wound, both facilities are capable of providing quality and emergency care 24 hours a day. While people understandably want convenient access to medical care whenever they need it, both types of ERs should really be reserved for real emergencies. This is especially true for hospital ERs where the same ER doctors treating coughs and urinary infections are usually simultaneously entrenched treating heart attacks, strokes, and trauma victims. Those critical patients will require the physician’s attention and may cause you to wait longer to be seen if you are more stable.\nBecause of the myriad of complaints and their sheer volume hospitals they have to use a strict triage system to decide who gets seen first. Time is important to everyone. In order to judge if a freestanding may be a better alternative, it is helpful to understand the hospital’s triage system. Triage usually consists of 5 levels based on severity. Level 1s are the most critical patient’s who can die without immediate life-saving interventions. This includes acute cardiac arrest patients who are receiving CPR. Their hearts have actually stopped beating and all the hospitals resources are brought to bear in the attempt to save the patient’s life. They garner the immediate attention of everyone on the team. Level 2s are the next most critical patients who should receive some medical attention within the first 15 minutes of arriving to an ER. These patient’s usually have abnormal vital signs or life threating complaints like chest pain and shortness of breath. Without quick treatment, these patients have the potential to become level 1s! They go to a room as soon as possible. Level 4s and 5s are much less sick and the most stable patients. These patients usually require no more than 1 X-ray or 1 lab test. Examples include ankle sprains, flu symptoms and bug bites. These are shuffled to the ER’s ‘fast track’ area where wait times are typically around an hour. Basically 1s, 2s, and even 4s and 5s all get seen pretty quickly. The problem is the guys in the middle – the dreaded level 3s. These are the abdominal pains, high fevers, headaches, complex lacerations, broken bones, concussions, dehydration and asthma exacerbations. Abdominal pain could be something serious like appendicitis, but it could also be constipation or gas. An asthma attack can turn deadly serious but the patient may just need a breathing treatment or a med refill. When everyone needs the doctor ‘now’ triage is the answer and Level 3s go to the back of the line and they wait the longest. They are too sick for an urgent care or the fast track area, but not sick enough to get sent quickly to a room. Getting triaged to Level 3 means going to the purgatory of the ER. Put simply, if there is a four hour wait, and you are designated a ‘level 3’ you will wait in the lobby for the entire four hours.\n“So, what do I do if I may be a level 3?”\nOne option is a freestanding ER (preferably with a board-certified ER doctor who has trained in hospital ERs). Many Freestanding ERs employ the same board-certified ER doctors as the major hospitals, and they can provide the same initial stabilization and treatment of most anything that walks through their door. They have CT scanners, Ultrasounds, X-ray and on-sight, hospital-quality labs. They can test for heart attacks and meningitis. They can safely sedate patients for painful procedures like setting broken bones. They are even equipped to place someone on temporary life support in preparation for transport to a hospital if needed. If someone needs admission to a hospital they can often have them transferred directly to a room in that hospital faster than if they had gone to that hospital’s own ER. In-short they are a great solution for the level 3s.\nThe primary concern with freestanding facilities is that they bill similar to hospital ERs and some are located in shopping centers and get mistaken for retail urgent care facilities. The trick is to look for the word “Emergency” on the building and to use them for emergencies only. Level 3s are true emergencies. They can turn into fatal situations and no one plans for these.\nAnother complaint is that the freestanding facilities are often out of network with insurers. Fortunately, insurers are required by law to cover all legitimate ER visits under their in-network plans regardless of whether the visit was at a freestanding ER or located in a hospital. It is important to note that many hospitals and/or their ER doctors are ‘out-of-network’ as well. Insurance companies and the state government recognize that no one has time to check the network status of an ER in the middle of an emergency.\nTo make it even easier, some freestanding ERs actually partner with an on-site urgent care that provides both services under one roof taking out ALL of the guess work.\nIf you have questions about your local freestanding ER, give them a call. Ask if their doctors are board-certified in emergency medicine. Ask if they balance bill. Ask if they have an urgent care on site for minor complaints.\nIn summary, all three types of facilities address the need for quick medical assistance. If you would typically visit your doctor, but they are unavailable due to the time or day, then urgent care is usually the next best place to seek medical assistance quickly. If you think you may have a level 3 complaint give your local freestanding ER a try. If you know you or your loved one needs immediate lifesaving care call 911.\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL FOR MORE RELEVANT,\nLOCAL HEALTH INFORMATION']	['<urn:uuid:9a678d9e-ed7c-4734-afb9-eebab14aa212>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T20:24:13.982178	10	67	1472
100	automated testing strategies microservices machine learning	Automated testing for microservices integrated with machine learning requires a multi-layered approach. In microservices, testing spans from unit tests of individual components to end-to-end testing of the complete system. For machine learning components, testing includes certification testing to verify model scoring accuracy after deployment, and shadow mode testing where models run against production data without influencing decisions. The testing strategy must verify both the microservices' communication paths and the ML models' performance. This includes testing service integration, API contracts, and validating model accuracy through metrics like ROC curves. The approach enables continuous delivery while ensuring system reliability through automated deployment machinery and testing at each level.	"['Given enough data, a supervised machine learning model can learn to detect fraud in new credit card applications. This model will give each application a score — typically between 0 and 1 — to indicate the likelihood that it’s fraudulent. The banks can then set a threshold for which they regard an application as fraudulent or not — typically that threshold will enable the bank to keep false positives and false negatives at a level it finds acceptable.\nFalse positives are the genuine applications that have been mistaken as fraud; false negatives are the fraudulent applications that are missed. Each false negative case has a direct financial impact on a bank as it corresponds to a financial loss. False positives are a little trickier to map to a financial figure since they represent the opportunity cost of losing a customer.\nGiven the impact fraudulent activity can have, it is vital to have an effective detection system. With fraudsters changing behavior constantly, a detection system is only effective if it can match this rate of change. This is the problem that we were helping with at one of our clients.\nA lengthy processFor the past few years, we’ve worked with a global financial institution, on a variety of projects including one to help improve their credit card application fraud detection.\nFigure 1: The existing system\'s behavior\n1. Customer applications go to the client’s application service\nFraud decision is made in three steps:\n2. The service sends the application to an external vendor.\n3. The vendor sends a decision on whether that application is fraudulent to the service\n4. The service approves or denies the application.\n- Filter the application through the rules, or known signs of fraud. For example, the rules would flag an application if it contained a known fraudulent e-mail or SSN.\n- Filtered applications go to the model. This model is a decisioning algorithm trained on historical data. For each application, the model will give it a score from 0 to 1 representing the fraud probability.\n- The strategies determine what decision to make based on the threshold.\nWhat’s more, these changes have to get on the backlog and release cycle for any third party service providers. The vendor would then prioritize the changes against requests from other clients. This proved to be a lengthy process. When combined with the governance delays, it could easily take a year or two to get updates into production. And that gives the fraudsters a huge opportunity to exploit the system.\nIntroducing continuous delivery to machine learningWe had two goals for this system:\n- Reduce the time taken to update the model\n- Increase the model’s accuracy\nFigure 2: Proposal for achieving the first goal\n1. The customer’s application goes to the application service\n2. The vendor receives it and filters it through the rules\n3. The vendor sends the application (plus any extra data) back to the service\n4. The service sends the application to all Challenger models and the Champion model\n5. The champion model sends the score back to the service\n6. The service sends the score back to the vendor\n7. Given the score, the strategies decide if the application is fraud\n8. The service approves or denies the application\nWe introduce the concept of Challenger models, which are models that score applications in production but will not make fraud decisions. The client’s fraud strategy team looks at these scores and analyze the model performance. When a model is performing well enough, the strategy team promotes it to become the champion. The score from the champion model goes to the strategies and helps make the fraud decisions. With challenger models we ensure that the most accurate model score is used to make a fraud decision.\nThe champion model and all the challenger models exist inside the client’s system. This removes the need to wait on the vendor\'s backlog when the champion model needs updating.\nThis process is practicing continuous delivery with machine learning. Consider the challenger models as a staging environment for testing models against production data. When a model is ready to \'be deployed to production,\' it’s promoted to the champion model. This promotion process reduces the time from a model’s inception to being deployed in production.\nThis system allows data scientists to experiment with different model algorithms, parameters, and feature sets against production data. With the champion model comes the risk of making decisions in production. Fortunately, because it has performed well in shadow mode, this risk is minimized.\nDigging into dataTo reach the second goal of improving the model’s accuracy, data munging — transforming and mapping data into more useful formats — needs to occur before model training. Data munging for historical data can take on many forms, for instance, filtering, transforming and deriving features.\nOne metric that can determine what happens with the data is cardinality — how many unique values are in a set. For instance, fields/columns that have a cardinality of 1 aren\'t useful for training at all. This is because a model cannot learn anything from a single value that has no variation across a dataset.\nThe same problem occurs for columns with very high cardinality. Example columns with high cardinality are first name, email address, and street address. High cardinality makes the training process slower and causes overfitting — when a model is trained well against data it knows but scores poorly on new data.\nIn both cases, it is better to drop these columns from the dataset before training the model.\nIn other cases, instead of filtering or dropping data, it may be more useful to transform it. Transforming high cardinality columns, such as email address, will reduce variation. A good example of this transformation is to drop the first part of the email and only keep the domain name.\nIn the example above, we moved down from a cardinality of 8 (eight unique emails) to a cardinality of 3 (three unique domain names). In a real-world scenario, millions of email address will reduce to a handful of domain names. Thus, the model can now determine the likelihood of fraud based on certain domain names.\nDeriving featuresAnother technique data scientists use is engineering “features” that improve the model\'s accuracy. We can derive certain features from patterns in the data. A good example is the distance between the credit card application\'s zip code and the applicant’s known IP address location. If the distance is greater than a certain number, we could infer fraudulent activity.\nFigure 3: Matching stated addresses with IP addresses\nNeedless to say, someone could legitimately apply for a credit card while on a business trip. Many credit card partners, such as airlines, offer inflight credit card application service. While this is a use case that could trigger ""fraud,"" a well trained model should handle it because their decisions are based on particular combination of variables. A single variable won\'t bias the decision too much.\nTaking advantage of these techniques will produce a more effective model. With more accurate models and the ability to switch them out quickly, there is a better chance of catching the fraudsters. To make this possible, we needed to redesign their fraud detection system.\nDesigning the systemThe system\'s new architecture has two parts: the workflow of the data scientist and developer. The goal of the data scientist workflow is to take data and output a trained model. The developer workflow then uses the trained model to score applications in production.\nThe goal of the data scientist workflow is to use historical data to train a machine learning model. Our goal was to provide a space for experimentation with transformation code and training algorithms.\nData scientist workflow\nFigure 4: Algorithm training\n1. The training data goes through data transformation\n2. H2O receives the transformed data and the desired decisioning algorithm\n3. H2O outputs the trained model and training statistics as java code\n4. The java code is packaged as a jar file\n5. A binary repository stores the jar file\nWith this system, we wanted to promote data science independence. The data scientists should be able to write all the transformation code in a language they are familiar with. In this system, the transformation code is written in Python.\nFor training the model, we use the AI framework H2O. One of the benefits was that it could use Python for the training and output the model as Java code, which is what the majority of the client’s systems were written in.\nThis system encourages Continuous Integration for a team of data scientists. As the team builds a model, a pipeline can track the transformation code and check the model’s accuracy. Besides training the model, H2O also outputs model statistics, including the validation score. To ensure quality, the build will fail if its validation score falls below a predefined level.\nThe data scientist workflow ends with storing models as jar files in a binary repository. The first step in the developer workflow is to service-enable these models. To do this, the developer takes a jar file and wraps it in a simple Java service. This can be a simple service because it only needs to expose the model\'s score method. Because there aren\'t many complexities, we use Spark Java as the web framework.\nFigure 5: Service enabling models\nWe need to ensure the scoring hasn\'t changed after transforming the model into a Java service. We achieve this through certification testing. We include an example application and its H2O model score in the jar file. When we send the example application to the service, we compare the resulting score to the H2O score. If they are within a certain tolerance range, due perhaps to differences in machine precision, we know the conversion from Python to Java went well.\nNow that our models have passed certification testing, we deploy them in “shadow mode.” This means they will begin running against production data but not influencing real decisions. In the diagram below, we see how the production data reaches models in shadow mode. The application service receives applications and sends them to the vendor for rule filtering. The diagram below illustrates how the service works with our system to get the score from the model. Once the service has the score, it sends it to the vendor to filter through the strategies.\nFigure 6: Deploying models in shadow mode\n1. The application service sends the application to the Decisioning & Analytics platform\n2. The platform sends the application to both the champion model and onto a message queue\n3. The Champion model sends the application’s score to the platform\n4. The platform sends the score to the application service\n5. The shadow mode models pick up applications from the message queue\n6. The shadow mode models sends scores to the message queue\n7. The platform receives scores from the message queues\n8. The platform sends the scores to a model predictions score\nThe model may need us to do some transformation to the application data in the Decisioning & Analytics Platform. In this case, the data scientists write this transformation code in Python, and we use Tornado, a Python web framework, to turn this transformation code into a service.\nSteps one to four are synchronous since the system needs the champion model score to make a final decision. Asynchronously, the models in shadow mode pick up applications from the message queue. If there was only one model in shadow mode, there would be no need for the message queue: the platform could send the application straight to the model. The queue allows for more models in shadow mode without updating the platform for each model.\nWe store the shadow model scores so that the fraud strategy team can use them to measure model performance. When a model performs well, the team can decide to promote a shadow model to become the champion model.\nOne of our goals was to decrease the time it takes to update a model. This system does that by introducing continuous delivery to machine learning. In shadow mode, we see how models perform in production but avoid the risk of them making the wrong decision. In this way, shadow mode is a staging environment for machine learning models. Practicing continuous delivery with machine learning can be very beneficial. As stated earlier, fraudsters are changing continuously. With the above system, we are enabling our system to change at their pace.\nTying it all togetherBelow is an overview of the value stream we were delivering to the client.\nFigure 7: The client\'s value stream\nData ingestion involves munging the client’s historical data. After cleaning, filtering and transforming the data, it\'s passed on for model training. After training, model metadata gets published for evaluation by a governance group. This metadata includes:\n- Training data quality metrics. What are the missing fields and how many of them are there?\n- Training and validation periods. How far apart is the validation period from the training period?\n- Most important features contributing to model decisions\n- Model accuracy reports (ROC curve)\nOnce a given model outperforms others, it gets passed on for a final governance evaluation. This happens before promoting the model to become ""champion."" Once a model becomes ""champion,"" it is now responsible for producing the score used to make a fraud decision.\nThe additional governance mitigates the risk that comes from making active decisions. Deploying models to ""Shadow Mode"" is much less risky since they do not make decisions. Instead, they only log scores. The final governance step is to ensure the best model is making decisions.\nThis value stream is not specific to credit card application fraud. It can be used to deploy any kind of machine learning models. For example, these models can tackle other problems such as:\n- Transaction fraud\n- Determine a pricing strategy for loans or interest rate decisions.\n- Determine credit card marketing and preferences based on consumer habits', 'Introduction to Microservices\nMicroservices strategy is an approach of developing an application by splitting it into smaller services, where each module runs in its own process and communicating with each other in a lightweight mechanism. These services are independently deployed and fully automated.\nMicroservice Testing is a new term introduced which changed the architecture of the software development, moreover, it changes the working culture of the teams the way teams work together.\nWhat are Microservices?\nMicroservices architecture divides the complex application into smaller modules. This provides a number of benefits over the monolithic architecture.\nMicroservices architecture deploys independently of the other modules. Microservices take this approach to independent services. With microservices, we will easily be able to adopt technology more quickly and understand how new advancements may help us.\nIn short, the Microservices architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.\nThese services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.\nImage Source – ThoughtWorks\nMultiple services work together to form whole application, Services like service A, service B and service C work independently, and they collaborate and form the whole application. These services collaborate for the functioning of the application. These chunks of services are called Microservices.\nBenefits of Microservices\nThe benefits of microservices are many and varied. Many of these benefits can be laid at the door of any distributed system. Microservices, however, tend to achieve these benefits to a greater degree primarily due to how far they take the concepts behind distributed systems and service-oriented architecture.\nThe most important benefit of the microservices is that it deployed independently of the other modules. In case if there is need to make changes to the module other modules remain unaffected. If one module stopped working then the application as a whole will not be affected only that one module will be affected.\nThe application which was broken down into smaller modules will be developed parallel to different developer work on different module and development of all the modules in parallel.\nNeed for Testing in Microservices\nIt is very important to test the microservices as to be very confident about the assumptions made for each service that it will do what it says to do. Testing of microservices is the first step in making the service reliable for the user. For the internal functional dependency of the microservices, the testing is more important for the service to stay strong.\nChallenges in Implementing Microservices\nMicroservices architecture includes numerous tiny independently services which integrate with each other to form the whole application. These microservices interact with each other in the production environment for the functionality of the application, although these small microservices are very simple while communicating with each other there arise many complexities. As the granularity of the application increases.\nMicroservices Testing Approach\nIt is essential that a microservice application is built with an awareness of how it can be tested. Having good test coverage gives you more confidence in your code and results in a better continuous delivery pipeline.\nAs this is a new architectural approach so require a new approach of doing automated testing and quality assurance. New approach divides the specific layer of tests. There is five layers of tests that are performed over microservices –\nWhat is Unit Testing?\nTests a single class or a set of closely coupled classes. These unit tests can either be run using the actual objects that the unit interacts with or by employing the use of test doubles or mocks.\nIn Unit testing, the smallest piece of testable software is tested in the application to determine whether it behaves as expected or not. Tests are typically run at the class level or around a small group of related classes. In unit testing, an important distinction is seen based on whether or not the unit under test is isolated from its collaborators.\nUnit tests are usually written by the programmers using their regular tools – the only difference being the use of the same sort of unit testing framework.\nThere is further two types of testing in Unit Testing\n- Sociable Unit Testing\n- Solitary Unit Testing\nSociable Unit Testing\nIt focuses on testing the behavior of modules by observing changes in their state. This treats the unit under test as a black box tested entirely through its interface.\nSolitary Unit Testing\nIt looks at the interactions and collaborations between an object and its dependencies, which are replaced by test doubles.\nImagine you’re testing an order class’s price method. The price method needs to invoke some functions on the product and customer classes. If you like your unit tests to be solitary, you don’t want to use the real product or customer classes here, because a fault in the customer class would cause the order class’s tests to fail. Instead, you use Test doubles for the collaborators.\nUnit testing alone does not provide a guarantee about the behavior of the system. Unit testing covers the core testing of each module, however, there is no coverage of the test when these modules collaborate to work together to interact with the remote dependencies.\nTo be sure about each module work correctly with remote dependencies finer coarse-grained testing is required.\nWhat is Integration Testing?\nIntegration tests are used to test communication between services. These tests are designed to test basic success and error paths over a network boundary.\nDifferent components interact with each other for their functional dependency, while communicating with each other integration test verifies the communication paths between the components and detect the interface defects.\nHere, all test modules are integrated together and tested as a subsystem. It checks that the communication paths between the subsystem work correctly while interacting with its peers. In microservice architecture, they are typically used to verify interactions between layers of integration code and the external components to which they are integrating.\nWhen the automated tests are written for the modules which are interacting with an external component, the basic goal is to verify the modules are interacting sufficiently with the external component.\nIt is very difficult to trigger abnormal behavior such as a timeout or slow responses from the external component. Special tests are written to ensure that test respond as expected in the unexpected circumstances\nPersistence integration tests provide assurances that the schema assumed by the code matches that is available in the data store.\nWith unit testing and integration testing, we can have confidence in the correctness of the logic contained in the individual modules that make up the microservice, but we cannot be sure that the microservices work together as a whole to satisfy business requirements.\nWhat is Component Testing?\nTests the full function of a single microservice. During this type of testing, any calls to external services are mocked in some way.\nA component is any well-encapsulated, coherent and independently replaceable part of a larger system. In a microservice architecture, the components are the services themselves.\nA component’s complex behavior is avoided by isolating it from its peers, also isolation help in controlling the test environment for the component.\nWhat is Contract Testing?\nTest the agreed contract for APIs and other resources that are provided by the microservice.\nAt the boundary of the external service, an Integrated contract test is done to verify the contract that is expected by the consuming service. This test verifies that the component meets a contract.\nA test suite is written to verify only those aspects of the producing service that is in use. The behavior of the service is not deeply tested, response latency and throughput should be within acceptable limits when input and output of the service call contain required attributes.\nThis test is written by each test consuming team and then packaged. The main aim of this test is to know the impact of the changes made by the maintainers on the consumers.\nWhat is the End-to-End Testing?\nEnd-to-End Testing, Tests a complete flow through the application or microservice. Usually used to test a golden path or to verify that the application meets external requirements.\nEnd-to-End testing tests the whole system from end to end. It verifies that the entire system meets the external requirements and eventually achieve its goal. Without bothering about the internal architecture of the application business goal should be achieved by the End to End testing.\nThe system is fully deployed and is treated as a black box and the test is exercised. With Public interference through GUIs and API, the system is manipulated. End to End Tests is more business facing.\nThis test verifies that the firewall, proxies, and load balancers are correctly configured.\nIn microservice architecture, for one behavior, there are many microservices which interact to respond to that behavior, an end to end testing provides value by adding coverage of gaps between the system.\nDifferent services pass messages to each other for a particular behavior and this test ensure correct message passing between the services.\nSummary of MIcroservices Architecture\nMicroservices architecture is a distributed approach designed to overcome the limitations of traditional monolithic architectures. It helps to scale applications and organizations while improving cycle times, however, they also come with a couple of challenges that may cause additional architectural complexity and operational burden.\nOne of the benefits of microservice architectures is agility. Because each individual service has a focused scope and an independent lifecycle, it takes less time to implement a new feature as a microservice, test it, and deploy it into production.\nHow Can XenonStack Help You?\nXenonStack offers Automation Testing in Microservices along with Microservices Performance Testing.
