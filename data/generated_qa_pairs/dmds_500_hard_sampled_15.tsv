217	how many people orange county recycling plant serve	The Orange County water recycling plant produces enough water to serve 800,000 people.	"['The liquid in the trough below looks remarkably like iced tea. But trust me, you don\'t want to drink it.\n""This is the first step of our treatment process,"" says Denis Bilodeau, vice-president of the Orange County Water District, on a metal catwalk next to a canal of municipal sewage.\n- California drought: \'Water cops\' hope to curb water waste\n- Farmers hit with record $1.5M fine for allegedly stealing water\nWater is precious in the drought-plagued region, and this massive water recycling plant in Fountain Valley, an hour south of Los Angeles, was built to convert raw sewage into drinkable H20.\nThe brown liquid begins to bubble. Then it will be drawn into straw-like filters 1/300th the size of a human hair.\n""That will keep all of the bacteria and viruses out,"" Bilodeau says.\nThe sewage will go through reverse osmosis and then be treated with intense UV light from bulbs manufactured by Ontario company Trojan UV.\n"" It\'s actually clean down to the atomic level, where all we have left is the H20 molecules,"" Bilodeau says. ""And now this plant produces enough water to serve 800,000 people.""\nGot any more sewage?\nAccording to the Orange County Water District, the facility is the largest of its kind in the world. Built in 2008, it has already gone through one expansion, and now Bilodeau says they\'re preparing for a second.\n""Our only limiting factor now is that we need more sewage water to process,"" Bilodeau says. ""Here in Orange County we actually have less sewage than we did 20 years ago because of all of the water conservation that takes place with low-flow toilets and low-flow shower heads.""\nUrban Californians are using a third less water than they were two years ago. But letting lawns go brown and fountains go dry isn\'t enough. Many here realize that at home they have to not just use less, but re-use more.\nThat\'s why Laura Allen decided to modified some of her appliances. Half of California\'s urban water is used on landscaping. But the garden at her apartment building gets most of its water from its sinks and washing machines.\nAs she washes her hands, the dirty water is piped from the sink into small underground reservoirs covered with small round covers. Water trickles out of the pipe and into the reservoir through a layer of wood shavings.\n""The greywater flows through, it soaks through the wood chips. And they are actually the filter, so they catch all the lint or debris in the water, and the greywater soaks down into the soil,"" Allen says.\nThe washing machine, too, has been retrofitted with a simple valve.\n""One side of the valve sends the water back to the sewer or the septic, the other side goes into our irrigation system,"" Allen says. ""You have to make sure you\'re using plant-friendly products… if you use that, the water\'s great quality for irrigation.""\nAs founder of the group Greywater Action, she now teaches people how to install their own water recycling systems, which are becoming more popular as Californians become more aware of the drought and receive generous incentives from water utilities.\n""Generally speaking, you can save 16 to 40 per cent of your water consumption,"" Allen says.\nThat\'s about 56,780 litres a year for an average household. Which is helpful, but some cities are starting to think a lot bigger.\nThis week, the the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California presented a plan to develop a water recycling plant in the Los Angeles area that could provide enough water for 300,000 people for a year. It would be even bigger than the mega-plant in Orange County, which generates enough to cover a quarter of the needs of the district\'s more than two million residents.\n""Once we explain to people that the water we create here is actually cleaner than bottled water or what\'s in their tap,"" Bilodeau says, ""then they understand that this water is very safe to drink.""\nExcept no-one will actually drink this water — at least not right away.\nRegardless of how much the water is filtered, health officials here still don\'t allow it to go directly from toilet-to-tap.\n""We\'re very mindful that perhaps the public isn\'t quite ready for that step yet,"" Bilodeau says.\nInstead, it\'ll be piped underground to replenish California\'s dwindling groundwater, which may eventually get drawn back into the municipal water supply.\nBut he\'s certain that soon Californians will have no choice.\n""The future is here,"" Bilodeau says.']"	['<urn:uuid:78034183-2d3f-4cb9-bcc0-a9ec9df69ac2>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-01T22:36:12.692263	8	13	750
43	What role does augmented reality play in teaching abstract STEM concepts, and how are new paper technologies being integrated into educational materials?	AR technology helps students visualize complex and abstract concepts in STEM subjects, particularly beneficial since students often struggle with theoretical postulations. Through haptic devices, students can manipulate and utilize their sensory faculties when constructing knowledge, enabling visualization of large and small phenomena and anatomical figures. Regarding paper technologies, new developments include second generation (2G) paper that uses optical recognition to trigger digital information, and third generation (3G) paper with embedded sensors that can connect to digital content, allowing paper documents to have hotlinks to multimedia content that plays on nearby devices.	"['Continuing on the series….\nHere are few ways in which AR can be applied in a school dynamic.\n- STUDENT ENGAGEMENT\nTechnology has often been cited as a tool to increase student engagement. Bonascio (2017) and Magana, Serrano & Rebello (2019) theorise that AR is able to prolong attention and focus, as when multimodal resources and haptic devices are used, higher levels of enjoyment are experienced. This gratification is significantly reduced in students that do not comprehend the mechanics of the technology and indicated that whilst utilising AR can improve digital literacy, explicit teaching is required to ensure that all students are able to interact successfully with the technology (Magana, Serrano & Rebello, 2019).\n2. INQUIRY LEARNING\nOddone (2019) and Foote (2018) both suggest that greater educational benefits arise from students creating their own interactive images and overlays rather than using supplied ones. Apps such as Metaverse or Augment can be used by students to construct their own interactive content and would be an ideal cross curricular inquiry task across any discipline, but have curriculum value within the Science, History and Geography inquiry skills section. Examples of inquiry tasks include:\n3. ABSTRACT CONCEPTS & STEM SUBJECTS\nMagana, Serrano & Rebello (2018, p.526) believe that there is a positive effect to using multimodal resources and active learning for science and its related fields. This is because students often need assistance with visualising complex and abstract concepts (Saidin, Abd Hali & Yahaya, 2015; Riva, Banos, Botella, Mantovani & Gaggioli, 2016). Abstract concepts can be problematic for many students because of the difficulty students can have in visualising theoretical postulations (Furio, Fleck, Bousquet, Guillet, Canioni & Hachet, 2017, p.2-3 ). This struggle can negatively influence a student’s perception of the content material and lead to adverse learning outcomes (Furio et al., 2017, p.2-3 ). AR technology allows students to visualise the concept, albeit in animation, and increase comprehension which leads to improved outcomes (Saidin, Abd Hali & Yahaya, 2015, Wu et al., 2013). This is because haptic devices allow students to manipulate and utilise their sensory faculties when they are constructing knowledge. Large and small phenomena, as well as anatomical figures, can be visualised using AR technology (Wu et al. 2013).\n4. READING – RECREATIONAL & INFORMATIONAL\nAR books is the largest growing trend in children’s publishing and that many publishers are supplementing traditional texts with AR embedded resources (Levski, 2018; Zak, 2014). This is because AR books are seen as more innovative and able to improve flagging reading rates in children and adolescents (Levski ,2018, Zak, 2014). Many young readers find the interactivity extremely engaging and the use of technology appeals to digital natives (Magana, Serrano & Rebello, 2019).\nMayahayuddin & Mamat, (2019) point out that the multimodal nature of AR improves literacy because the audio visual cues assist students in decoding. Additionally, AR enables students that have low focus or attention to enhance their learning as it grants access to language in both formal and informal contexts, which is very useful for students with ADD, ADHD and those with social anxiety (Rafiq & Hashim, 2018, p.31; Mayayuddin & Mamat, 2019. These benefits are further improved when AR is combined with gaming principles which provides additional interest and intrinsic motivation (Mayahayuddin & Mamat, 2019; Levski 2018).\nFoote, C.

Information Technology and Libraries.', ""Next generation paper: Connecting paper to the web\nThis multidisciplinary project aims to explore the future of paper and its connection to the web. It will do so in the domain of travel and tourism where paper and screen-based information are already used together in the tourist experience.\nThe project proposal was in response to a call on ‘Content creation and consumption in the digital economy’. It aims to create new technology and business opportunities in the publishing and tourism industries. It will do this by using augmented reality and printed electronics to connect paper to the web, in what the team call second generation (2G) and third generation paper (3G).\nIf today’s ordinary paper is considered first generation (1G) paper, then 2G paper will be optically recognised with a camera, triggering associated digital information to be played or displayed on a nearby device.\n3G paper will dispense with the camera and contain tiny sensors printed or embedded in the fibres of the paper itself. This will trigger the same kind of associations around it. In this way, paper documents and books could have hotlinks to webpages, audio, video clips and so on that could play on speakers or screens around them. The team will be looking at how this could change and connect the use of paper and screen-based information in tourism, where tourist brochures and guides already co-exist with mobile apps, digital photography and online booking systems.\nMore information is available in this press release.\nA key feature of the project is that it will be investigating new business models for next generation paper, alongside building and testing the technology itself. This means that we will be working closely with our industrial partners on options for commercialisation and establishing industry standards.\nThe project team\nThis includes five groups at Surrey and one at the Open University.

168	As a literary scholar, I'm curious how death inspires creation in Joyce and Verdi. Care to explain?	Both works show how death catalyzed creative responses, but in different ways. In Joyce's Ulysses, death and infertility are symbolically explored through Stephen's 'Parable of the Plums' where two barren women throw plum seeds from atop Nelson's pillar, representing Dublin's cultural stagnation. In contrast, Verdi directly responded to death by creating his Messa da Requiem - first conceived as a collaborative work after Rossini's death in 1868, then fully realized as his own composition following Manzoni's death in 1873, transforming loss into a powerful musical legacy.	"['by James Joyce\nUlysses Aeolus Analysis Summary\nIn the last few episodes, we\'ve been focusing a great deal on character development. Here, let\'s put our eye on the theme of the chapter. Namely: pumped up rhetoric and the chaos of the media world.\n""Aeolus"" has the first visually jarring stylistic change-up in the book: the insertion of newspaper headlines throughout the chapter. There are a number of different ways to think about what these headlines are doing here. As we keep saying, style is something that is extremely flexible in Ulysses. The way that Joyce writes incorporates the moods and emotions of his characters as well as the current setting. It\'s not too hard to imagine the free-associating Mr. Bloom imagining everything that goes on in the newspaper office in terms of headlines, but that\'s not quite what\'s going on here. The headlines are coming from outside the context of the scene. We\'re being made aware of the narrator of the story, and of the fact that the book is aware of itself as a book. Whoever is telling this story acknowledges that it is being written, and this acknowledgment of the written form allows the narrator to toy with the form as he sees fit.\nThere\'s another way one might think of these headlines. Normally, when we wander down to breakfast to read the paper, we think of headlines as something quite separate form our lives. The newspaper is telling us: ""This is what\'s going on in the world today. Listen up."" We think of the news as something external, something that happens to us, something out there. The waythat the headlines in ""Aeolus"" pick up on little bits of speech between the men in the newspaper office and puts words to minor events emphasizes the fact that the news is pulled from everyday experiences. It is tied into human lives, not disconnected from them. In other words, the news records what\'s going on in the world; it does not dictate it.\nNow, in the Odyssey, Aeolus is the god of the winds. He first agrees to help Odysseus make his way home by harnessing all of the winds and putting them into a bag for Odysseus to keep while he sails home. Yet Odysseus\'s crew, thinking that the bag must be full of treasure, opens it and the winds are released. They are blown all about and eventually end up back at Aeolus\'s island. This time he isn\'t so ready to help Odysseus.\nHere, the winds are compared to the rhetoric of the journalism world: speech just being blown this way and that without really being controlled or carefully crafted. In the back offices of the paper, the men banter and recall great journalists and orators of the past. But speech just floats about in the chapter. Many stories hang open-ended. We often move from one conversation to another without much warning or indication. Each person\'s words are overblown and largely directionless. Bloom is one of the only men there who seems to be focused upon a specific task – renewing Keyes\'s ad – but his attempts are thwarted. Crawford, eager to hurry over to the bar, tells Bloom that Keyes can ""Kiss his Royal Irish Arse.""\nAs the cast of minor characters continues to widen, we also get more of a sense of the overall atmosphere of Dublin. We learn that Myles Crawford is something of a drunk; we see that for all his erudition professor MacHugh isn\'t exactly set on accomplishing much; we are introduced to J.J. O\'Molloy who once was a promising lawyer but now has fallen on hard times and needs a loan. As in Dubliners, we get a sense of Dublin as a stifling place, one that is quick to knock men\'s ambitions flat. And the solution here is often: go to the pub.\nThe chapter also brings our two major characters, Bloom and Stephen Dedalus, into early glancing contact. Stephen Dedalus enters while Bloom is across the street trying to track down Keyes. Then Bloom returns just as Stephen and the rest of the men are headed out to the pub. Bloom observes Dedalus as ""a moving spirit"" and it is clear that he is attentive to him as he notices that he has put on new boots. Stephen, in contrast, doesn\'t even acknowledge Bloom. Stephen\'s in his element; Bloom is not. The newspapermen dote on Stephen. Crawford agrees to publish Deasy\'s letter because it came from Stephen, and offers him a job at the paper. Bloom, by contrast, is constantly slighted by other men in the office and remains aloof, left to observe them as they all go off drinking together.\nWhat\'s the deal with ""The Parable of the Plums?"" Stephen tells a bizarre story about these two old Irish virgins climbing up to the top of Nelson\'s pillar, having a picnic on top and throwing their plum seeds down to Dublin. First, note that Lord Nelson was a British Flag Officer famous for his participation in the Battle of Trafalgar. He later became famously embroiled in an affair with the wife of the British Minister to Naples. In Joyce\'s time, there was much controversy over the pillar in the center of O\'Connell street that had been set up to commemorate Nelson. Part of the controversy was related to the fact that there was a statue honoring a British officer in the center of Dublin when many people in the city wanted nothing more than to be free of their British oppressors. On a simpler level, people thought that it was ugly and that it blocked traffic (this controversy was settled later, in 1966, when some IRA men blew up the pillar; today the Spire of Dublin stands in its place).\nNow, in Stephen\'s parable, these two older women who have never given birth to anyone hike up the top of this British monument and sit admiring Dublin. They eat their plums and then throw down the seeds. On one level, Stephen is comparing Dublin (namely, an independent Dublin) to the Promised Land in the Old Testament. But, in his version, the people looking out on the Promised Land are looking out on it from a British monument. Everything seems barren, infertile, unpromising; the old women eat their plums, but then toss the desiccated seeds down into the street. In short, optimism is not running high in Dublin.', 'Classical music has such a long, storied history, that it can be difficult to know where to start. Each week, we’ll be exploring an important event that left its mark.\nThis week? Gioachino Rossini’s death inspired Verdi to launch an ambitious project involving twelve Italian composers to create a requiem in his honor. The project was eventually aborted, but Verdi’s musical tribute to Rossini survives in the Libera Me of his Messa da Requiem, a grandiose work composed in honor of another idol…\nLike most requiems, Verdi’s Messa da Requiem began with an ending.\n“A great name has disappeared from the world!”\nThe great opera composer Gioachino Rossini died in November 1868, and Giuseppe Verdi—the great opera composer of his own generation—was deeply moved. But, when Verdi wrote the above in a letter, he was also thinking about another Italian artistic titan.\n“When the other one who still lives is no more, what will we have left?”\n“The other one?” He was referring to Alessandro Manzoni, a poet and novelist of about Rossini’s age, best known for The Betrothed. But for now, Verdi’s attention was mainly focused on his dear, departed fellow composer.\nVerdi hit upon an original idea with which to mark Rossini’s life. On the first anniversary of his death, he proposed, a requiem mass would be performed. It would be written jointly by Italy’s leading composers, with Verdi contributing one movement himself—as it transpired, the final movement, Libera me (above).\nAs if that project weren’t unusual enough already, Verdi had some rather specific stipulations. For a start, rather than getting paid, the composers and performers would be expected to contribute financially to the project. After the performance, the score “should be sealed and placed in the archives… from which it should never be taken,” except perhaps for anniversaries. Oh, and Verdi would quit the project immediately if anyone foreign or unartistic became involved.\nCasting an eye over Verdi’s demands, it’s perhaps surprising that the Messa per Rossini project got off the ground at all. But a fairly promising start was not enough to make it happen. The project gave up the ghost fairly slowly, but seems to have been consigned to an unmarked grave by August 1871.\nBy then, however, Verdi had written his own Libera me. “Deliver me, O Lord” says the text… and yet Verdi’s music lingered unperformed.\nThen, on May 22, 1873, Alessandro Manzoni died.\nAnd this time, Verdi decided to write the whole thing himself. He had already written the ending.\nThings went far more smoothly this time. He met his own deadlines, and the first performance did indeed take place on the first anniversary of Manzoni’s death—May 22, 1874—at the church of San Marco in Milan. Unlike the plan for the Rossini requiem, further performances were permitted: three more immediately took place at La Scala. The reaction was positive from almost everyone, with Hans von Bülow one of few exceptions. An “opera in ecclesiastical costume,” he called it. Referring to a sacred work by a leading opera composer, this is surely one of music history’s least imaginative insults.\nThe troubled genesis of Verdi’s Requiem is now a matter for the history books.

326	I'm researching historical art - how did ancient Jewish and Egyptian cherubim compare?	The Egyptian and Jewish cherubim designs showed remarkable similarities. The Egyptians had arks decorated with winged guardian figures that were carried by priests using two poles, just like the Israelite Ark of the Covenant which had two permanent poles and cherubim on top. These similarities can be seen in Egyptian artifacts like Tutankhamun's Shrine. Both cultures used their arks in military contexts - Egyptian reliefs show their ark with cherubim in battle scenes, while biblical accounts describe the Israelite ark being carried into battles against the Midianites, at Jericho, and during the reigns of Kings Saul and David. These parallels reflect how the Israelites, having lived in Egypt, likely adapted and modified certain Egyptian practices while rejecting others. The cherubim in both cases were winged figures meant to guard and protect sacred objects.	['Maimonides taught that the Torah only “allowed” sacrifices because the Israelites saw pagans showing love of their gods by offering them, but the Torah restricted how the offerings should be made (Guide of the Perplexed 3:32). The Cherubim is an example of how the Israelites copied pagan practices.\nOne of the most perplexing ancient Jewish articles is the Ark of the Covenant that tradition states contained both the shattered and whole Decalogue (Ten Commandments). The Ark had two poles that were never removed from the box. No reason is given for this practice. The cover of the Ark contained two winged figures called cherubim. No explanation was offered in the Bible for their presence, leaving us with only speculation. What is most bothersome is that the presence of two winged creatures seems to violate the biblical law prohibiting the building of such figures.\nWhat were the cherubim?\nThe cherubim were two figures placed on top of the ark which was set in the holiest place in the tabernacle and later temples, the “holy of holies.” Some scholars and rabbis say that perhaps the purpose of the cherubim was to screen the ark with their wings so that the ark would not be seen. Others say that the cherubim were guards protecting the ark. A decorative representation of the cherubim was also placed on many parts of the tabernacle and temples. What were the cherubim?\nThe term cherubim is obscure. Some scholars think it is an inversion of letters and is derived fromrekhuv, which means “chariot.” Others suggest that it is from the Akkadian karabu, “to pray” or “to bless” and that the cherubim were beings who interceded and brought the prayers of humans to the gods. We simply do not know.\nScripture does not describe the cherubim. Based on the Babylonian Talmud, Sukkah 5b, Rashi relates a tradition that they had children’s faces, although when cherubim are first mentioned in Genesis 3:24, both Saadiah Gaon and Rashi described them as angels. Rashbam, Rashi’s grandson, suggested that they had the form of birds.\nTwo biblical sources, Exodus and II Chronicles, give different descriptions of the cherubim arrangement. Exodus states that the two figures had “faces [turned] to the other.” Chronicles says instead that they “faced the house,” the temple. The Babylonian Talmud offers a homiletical explanation for the difference: when Israel did the will of God, the cherubim faced each other; but when they did not do God’s will, they faced away from each other.\nThis is a nice sermonic lesson; however, we know that the biblical book of Chronicles has many differences from the Five Books of Moses. It even changed names of biblical characters and spelled names differently. While the authors of the biblical books Judges, Joshua, Samuel, and Kings told about the ancient Israelites and included their faults and failures, the author of Chronicles wrote his book to show the glory of the past and omitted the ancestors’ faults. Thus he was not careful to copy what others wrote before him. It seems clear that even in the far ancient time, centuries before the Common Era, biblical writers did not know what the cherubim looked like or anything about its origin and purpose.\nJosephus, writing in his book Antiquities during the first century CE, admits that we no longer have any idea what the cherubim looked like or what their function was. We know that other ancient cultures had similar if not the same structures. The Babylonians, for example, used winged bulls with human faces set at the entrance to their temples and palaces to protect them.\nDid the ancient Israelites copy the Babylonian idea or an even earlier one? Are these figures a violation of the Decalogue command not to make figures? Many rabbis say that that the commandment only prohibited making idols to worship them and didn’t prohibit making other statutes and paintings.\nThe Egyptians had them before the time of the Torah\nThe ark and covering figures used by the ancient Egyptians was startlingly similar to the Israelite ark and cherubim. Pictures of the ark and its winged guardians can be found in several places in Egypt today, including on Tutankhamen’s Shrine and on top of King Tut’s Tomb. The pictures can be seen on www.thelivingmoon.com/42stargate/03files/Egyptian_Arks.html.\nEgypt was the most powerful nation in the world in biblical times. Its culture was very advanced. Living in Egypt for centuries, the Israelites, which my friend Hessel Meilech called “the world’s chameleons,” probably absorbed and improved many Egyptian ideas while, at the same time, rejecting many of them, such as the Egyptian ceremonies and theology regarding the dead.\nThe Israelites must have seen the Egyptian ark decorated with its cherubim carried by Egyptian priests by means of the two poles that extended from its base.\nScholars have been puzzled for ages why the Israelite ark had two poles that were never removed even when the ark and its cherubim were placed in the “holy of holies,” hidden behind a curtain. Arnold Ehrlich suggested in his book Mikra Ki-Pheschuto that the poles were left in the ark because from time to time the priests or levites would carry the ark to various communities so that the people could see it and perhaps donate toward the maintenance of the temple.\nNow we know that Ehrlich was right. The Egyptian ark not only had cherubim but also poles, and we have pictures of the Egyptian priests carrying their ark from place to place while holding it by its poles.\nAdditionally, it appears that the Israelites used their ark in another way similar to the Egyptians. Reliefs illustrating Rameses military camp at the Battle of Kadesh depict an ark with cherubim in the center of the battlefield (See here: http://www.amazon.com/The-warfare-Biblical-lands-archaeological/dp/B0007DK08C ). Likewise, Moses told the priests to lead the ark into battle against the Midianites (Numbers 31:6). In the Israelite’s conquer of Jericho, the ark went in front of the marchers around the city (Joshua 6:6-8). King Saul had the ark carried into battle (1 Samuel 14:18), as did King David (2 Samuel 11:11).\nThis raises an issue far more bothersome than the question of the violation of the divine prohibition against making images: adopting non-Jewish practices. Actually, this copying of the cherubim is far from unique. Judaism incorporated many non-Jewish practices and theological notions, some of which are bizarre and totally contrary to basic Jewish beliefs.\nWe changed the concept of when the day begins from morning to evening, when the year starts from the spring to the fall, we took the names of the “Hebrew” months from the Babylonians despite at least one being the name of a Babylonian idol, we accepted the Babylonian notion that God judges people during the fall new year (and not before?), and much more. Even many rabbis were and are convinced that St. Augustine’s view that there is an “original sin” which soiled humanity is Jewish. The idea is found in the writings of rabbis in the middle ages and we hear it in sermons today. Augustine (354-430) developed the concept to explain why Jesus had to die: “he died for our sin.” While this notion did not exist before the fourth century and is a basic Christian belief, many Jews bought into it without realizing its origin and without seeing that it is inexplicable: although Augustine said that Jesus died to save humanity by removing “original sin,” people believe they are still stained by it today.\nMaimonides’ Guide of the Perplexed 3:32 explains the ark\nMaimonides’ explained in his Guide of the Perplexed 3:32 that the relatively primitive ancient Hebrews needed to be weaned from old beliefs and customs such as sacrifices. God “allowed” sacrifices to continue in a restricted manner, although God did not want or need them, because the people needed them: they saw that other nations used sacrifices to show their love of their gods. The ark is a good example of his insight.\n Biblical citations for the cherubim, for example, are Genesis 3:24; Exodus 25:18–20, 26:1, 31, 36:8, 35; I Kings6:27–29, 32, 35, 7:29, 36; I Samuel 4:4; II Samuel 6:2, 22:11; II Kings 19:15; Isaiah 37:16; Ezekiel 1ff, 10ff, 28:13ff, 37:7–9, 41:18–20, 25; Psalms 18:11, 80:2, 99:1; I Chronicles 28:18; and II Chronicles 3:13. See also the Babylonian Talmud, Bava Batra 99a and Yoma 54a-b.\n Exodus 25:20 and 37:9.\n II Chronicles 3:13.\n Bava Batra 99a.', 'What Kind of Creatures Are the Cherubim?\nThe centerpiece of a typical temple in the ancient world was a statue of a god. The tabernacle (משכן) is different in that it does not have such a statue. What it does have are two golden statues of cherubim (כרובים) who spread their wings over the kapporet, the lid of the ark of the testimony (Exodus 25:18–20 ≈ 37:7–9). Above the kapporet from between these two cherubim, YHWH meets with Moshe and speaks to him (Exodus 25:22 ≈ Numbers 7:89; cf. Leviticus 16:2).\nThe impression given by Exodus, that cherubim played a central role in the earliest stage of Judaism, is reinforced by references to cherubim elsewhere in the Tanakh:\n- Statues of cherubim, of a somewhat different form, also spread their wings over the ark in the Jerusalem temple (1 Kings 6:23–28 ≈ 2 Chronicles 3:10–13; 1 Kings 8:6, 7 ≈ 2 Chronicles 5:7, 8; 1 Chronicles 28:18).\n- Two-dimensional representations of cherubim decorate surfaces of the tabernacle (Exodus 26:1 = 36:8, 26:31 = 36:35) and the temple (1 Kings 6:29, 32, 35; 7:29, 36; Ezekiel 41:18, 20, 25; 2 Chronicles 3:7, 14).\n- Living cherubim are associated with the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:24; Ezekiel 28:14, 16)\n- They are, apparently, described as being with YHWH as something he rides or sits upon (2 Samuel 22:11 ≈ Psalms 18:11; Ezekiel 9:3; 10:1–22; 11:22).\n- Cherubim constitute a component in an epithet of YHWH which can be translated provisionally as “the cherubim sitter” or “the cherubim dweller”: י(ו)שב הכר(ו)בים / ישב כרובים (1 Samuel 4:4; 2 Samuel 6:2 ≈ 1 Chronicles 13:6; 2 Kings 19:15 ≈ Isaiah 37,16; Psalms 80:2; 99:1).\nWhat, specifically, is a cherub? In other words, what form or forms of creatures does the word כרוב designate?\nThe first recorded attempt to identify the form of the cherub was made by the amora R. Abbahu of Caesarea (ca. 279–320), who employed a midrashic reading of כרוב as כרביא, which can be translated from Aramaic as “like a lad,” to assert that the cherub resembles a child (b. Ḥagigah 13b, Sukkah 5b). However, the cherubim are said to have wings (Exodus 25:20 = 37:9; 1 Kings 6:24, 27 ≈ 2 Chronicles 3:11–13; 1 Kings 8:6–7 = 2 Chronicles 5:7–8), and winged children are not attested in the iconography of the Land of Israel in the biblical period.\nThis identification is likely prompted by the erotes and cupids, the oft-winged boys that personified amorousness in the Greco-Roman art of R. Abbahu’s time. This conclusion can also explain the existence of several peculiar talmudic homilies attributing an erotic aspect to the cherubim of the Jerusalem temple (b. Yoma 54a–b).\nAn anonymous sage in Midrash Hagadol asserted that the cherub resembles a human in all respects except that it has the wings of a bird; the anonymous exegete, unlike R. Abbahu, did not specify an age and presumably had in mind an adult. This view was endorsed in part by Radak (ca. 1160–1235) and Ralbag (1288–1344). The identification of cherubim as winged humans, whether adults or children, found early expression in Jewish and Christian visual art. For example, an illuminated Hebrew manuscript from northern France, dated to 1277–1286, shows the tabernacle ark cherubim as childlike creatures with six wings each, as influenced by Isa 6:2 [Figure 1].\nIt is now known that the winged adult human is a common denizen of ancient Near Eastern iconography, and several modern scholars have identified the cherub with it, including Carl F. Keil and Franz Delitzsch, Robert Pfeiffer, and Louis-Hugues Vincent.\nRashbam (ca. 1085–1158) and Hizkuni (thirteenth century) stated that cherubim are birds. This identification enjoys visual expression in a fifteenth-century drawing by the prolific Jewish illuminator Joel b. Simeon Feibush showing the biblical ark surmounted by two pigeon-like birds [Figure 2]. In the modern era, François Lenormant expressed the same idea regarding the tabernacle ark cherubim, writing that they were probably birds fashioned in the Egyptian artistic style.\nAn intermediate position between this view and the preceding one was taken by Abraham b. Moses Maimonides (1186–1237), who suggested that the ark cherubim in the tabernacle had human heads and faces and avian wings, bodies and feet. He admitted the speculative nature of the suggestion and adduced no arguments in its favor.\nRashbam’s student Joseph Bekhor Shor (second half of the twelfth century), whose name means “firstborn of an ox” – coincidence? – along with Isaac of Vienna (ca. 1180–1250) and other tosafists, proffered the view that typical cherubim are “angels in the image of oxen.” Later scholars, such as the seventeenth-century Protestant polymath Hugo Grotius, promoted similar views. One reason for this suggestion is the fact that the word “שור” in Ezekiel 1:10 is replaced by “כרוב” in Ezekiel 10:14, implying the terms are synonymous.\nBy the end of the eighteenth century, material evidence was adduced to support these views: the human-headed winged bull colossi of Persepolis, which were known from a drawing and description by Dutch traveler Cornelis de Bruyn [Figure 3]. Later, the publicity received by colossal human-headed winged bulls in Assyrian palaces excavated in the mid-nineteenth century [Figure 4], along with the mistaken belief that the Akkadian words kirûbu or kāribu designated these beings, boosted the view that cherubim shared the form of these colossi.\nDoubting the association of the cherub with the human-headed winged bull, the nineteenth-century biblicist August Dillmann preferred to connect the cherub with the griffin, or raptor-headed winged lion. The griffin appears in ancient Levantine iconography; for example, on a thirteenth-century B.C.E. ivory plaque from Megiddo [Figure 5].\nThe prevailing opinion in current scholarship is that the cherub is a winged sphinx, i.e., a human-headed winged lion, such as that depicted on the sarcophagus of the late second-millennium B.C.E. Phoenician king Ahiram [Figure 6]. However, numerous indications found in the descriptions of the sculpted cherubim over the ark (Exodus 25:18–20 = 37:7–9; 1 Kings 6:23–26) reveal that their authors presupposed upright creatures.\nEvidence that the Cherubs Stand Upright\nSheltering with Wings - In the tabernacle, the ark cherubim are described as facing each other and “sheltering the kapporet with their wings” (Exodus 25:20 = 37:9). As noted by Umberto Cassuto and Richard Barnett, if the cherubim stood on four feet, they would shelter the כַּפֹּרֶת with their bodies, not with their wings.\nStanding on the Edge - It can be added that the cherubim are said to be located on either “edge” (קצה) of the kapporet (ibid. 25:18–19 = 37:7–8). If they stood on four legs and their bodies stretched over the length of the kapporet, the word “edge” would be inappropriate.\nAwkward Position for Four-Legged Creature - Moreover, the statement that the cherubim shelter the kapporet with their wings indicates that the wings are extended forward (toward the center of the kapporet), beyond their heads. No depiction of a creature standing on four legs with its wings extended in such an awkward and clumsy position can be found in ancient Near Eastern visual art.\nNo Length Measurement - In the case of the ark cherubim in the temple, the biblical text notes their height and “width” (wingspan), but not their length (1 Kings 6:23–28). As argued by Otto Thenius and many subsequent scholars, this can only be understood if we assume that the cherubim are upright and therefore have no significant length.\nWingspan Equal to Height - An additional indication that the temple ark cherubim are upright creatures is that they are described as possessing a wingspan, 10 cubits (1 Kings 6:24, 25; cf. 2 Chronicles 3:11–13), that equals their height, also 10 cubits (1 Kings 6:23, 26). Franz Landsberger noted that this proportion does not evoke animal forms. Martin Metzger developed the argument in light of his investigation of composite creatures in the ancient Near East. He stated that a composite four-legged creature whose height when standing on its four feet is 10 cubits would have wings of 12–15 cubits each – a length significantly greater the 5 cubits specified in the Bible.\nThe uprightness of the cherub precludes its identification with the winged sphinx, as well as the winged bovine and griffin, which are all non-upright, four-legged creatures.\nA final possibility, first proposed by the tenth-century Jewish grammarian Menahem ibn Saruq, is that כרוב simply means “figure.” Abraham ibn Ezra (ca. 1090–1160s) later elaborated on this idea, stressing that in different contexts the word can refer to different types of creatures. Ibn Saruq and Ibn Ezra follow an older tradition expressed in Targum Neofiti and Saadia b. Joseph Gaon, both of whom rendered the word כרבים in the descriptions of the tabernacle tapestries as “figures.”\nAn entirely different view etymologically, but one which leads to a similar, generalized identification of the cherub, was expressed by the thirteenth-century tosafist Isaac b. Judah Halevi in his work Panah Raza. He explained the root כרב as carrying the meaning “mix.” Thus, he characterized the cherubim of Eden in Genesis as “angels in the form of demons” and argued that their name is a reflection of the fact that they contain a mixture of two species. This identification seems essentially the same as what today would be called a composite or hybrid creature (German: Mischwesen).\nLike the previously cited views, the understanding of כרוב as referring to composite creatures generally, or to a class thereof, has been revived in modern times. Contemporary scholars advocating this position rely on the existence of what they see as contradictory descriptions of cherubim within the Hebrew Bible.\nThis view is challenged by the fact that the biblical writers usually neglect to specify the form of the cherub, even when specifying other details such as materials, position, and dimensions (Exodus 25:18–20 = 37:7–9; 1 Kings 6:23–28 ≈ 2 Chronicles 3:10–13). This omission indicates that there was assumed to be a typical form, with which the reader would be familiar.\nWinged Adult Revisited\nI believe that the the anonymous sage in Midrash Hagadol was correct, and the cherubim are winged humans. Recall that the ark cherubim in the temple are described as having a wingspan that equals their height (1 Kings 6:23–26). Not only four-legged animals, but also upright creatures, whether real ones such as birds or fantastic ones such as winged snakes, would have to have comically short wings in order for their wingspan to be only as great as their height.\nIndeed, we don’t find any depictions of these creatures in the iconographic record that have these proportions. Only humans, who stand erect on long legs and are by far the tallest of any of the candidates in proportion to their other dimensions, can have wings whose span equals their height that still look respectably long. Indeed, humans normally possess an arm-span that precisely equals their height. The Roman architect Vitruvius observed this fact long ago, writing in the context of proportionality in temples (De architectura 3.1.3):\nIf we measure the distance from the feet [of a man] to the top of the head, and we copy the measure to the outstretched arms, we find that the width equals the height, as with surfaces that are perfect squares.\nThis principle was famously illustrated in Leonardo da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man drawing [Figure 7]. When depicting a winged human, it would make sense to portray the wings as having the length of arms.To be sure, winged humans in ancient Levantine iconography often have wings that are extravagantly long, far longer than their arms. But, as noted below, instances are known where the artist portrays the wings as being equivalent to arms and possessing the same length that the arms do (when they exist) or would (when they do not exist).\nIllustrating Wings as Arms\nThree examples will suffice:\nFirst, a stamp seal from Beth Shemesh, which, according to Keel, should probably be dated to ca. 1100–900 B.C.E., depicts an armless, winged human whose wings are spread straight out to his sides [Figure 8], like the ark cherubim in the temple (1 Kings 6:24–27 ≈ 2 Chronicles 3:11–13).\nSecond, a cylinder seal from Tell el-Ajjul, in the vicinity of Gaza, dated by Teissier to the period of ca. 1820–1740, portrays a pair of armless, winged humans spreading their wings out in front of them, like the ark cherubim in the tabernacle, and sheltering a tree [Figure 9].\nThird, a fragmentary Phoenician openwork ivory found in Nimrud, probably from the ninth or eighth century B.C.E., shows a winged human with wings extended in the same position; the upper wing is preserved and is the same length as the adjacent arm [Figure 10].\nConclusion – Winged Humans on the Ark\nThus, the author of the passage in Kings describing the temple ark cherubim could only have had winged humans in mind. If so, we should regard it as probable that other biblical authors writing about cherubim did, too.\nTheTorah.com is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.\nWe rely on the support of readers like you.

215	martin gerlach photographer and sigmund freud work timeline comparison vienna	Martin Gerlach relocated his photography publishing house to Vienna in 1872, while Sigmund Freud began offering therapy to patients in Vienna in 1886, showing they both worked in Vienna during overlapping time periods in the late 19th century.	"['Festoon made from vegetables and beets, from Festons und Decorative Gruppen aus Pflanzen und Theiren, or, Festoons and decorative groups of Plants and Animals, published in Vienna in 1893 by Martin Gerlach. Images courtesy of the Museum für Kunst und Gerwerbe, Hamburg\nThese festoons with their sumptuous cascades of ripe fruits and fragrant roses suspended from a striped silk ribbon resemble at first glance sections of stone ornament, or plaster moulding. But closer inspection reveals the roses to be cabbages, the delicious looking fruits are in fact beetroots and onions, the elaborate silk bow is a curtain cord, and a wooden finial has been pressed into service as a classical-looking prop, hiding the ends of plant stems at the top of the arrangement.\nAll the festoons, swags, garlands and other embellishments in Festons und Decorative Gruppen aus Pflanzen und Theiren, or, Festoons and decorative groups of Plants and Animals, are constructed using similarly inventive combinations of flowers, vegetables, taxidermy and domestic objects. Published in Vienna in 1893 by Martin Gerlach, this book of elaborate photographic collages was intended both as reference and inspiration for artists working across a range of crafts using pattern, from wood carving, plaster work, textiles, illustration and wallpaper design.\nJudging by the seasonality of the plant materials Gerlach used, the photographs were taken over the course of many months. Early spring blossoms of apple and cherry with nesting birds give way to the lilac, roses and hollyhocks of summer, while autumn provides a profusion of gourds, sweetcorn, grapes, apples and pumpkins. Winter is represented by arrangements of pine cones and stuffed squirrels placed amongst evergreen conifer branches.\nSome of the most effective designs use only leaves – the winding stems of creeping cinquefoil form a delicate narrow border, while larger sprigs of oak leaves and acorns could be imagined as infill sections for fabric or wallpaper. Peony flowers and leaves carefully spaced over a diamond grid background would have been helpful for an artist designing a repeat pattern.\nGarlands of citrus fruits are shown in half-sections, the smaller fruits at the edges, gradually increasing in size towards the middle. Some of the most elaborate festoons include tools and musical instruments – in one example a gardener’s spade intersects with a watering can, while a straw basket (or maybe an upturned straw hat?) overflows with produce, celebrating the bounty of harvest.\nFrom the middle of the 19th century photographers such as Adolphe Braun (1812 – 1877) and Charles Aubry (1811 – 1877) saw a commercial opportunity to produce still life studies of flowers as reference material for artists. Although photographs could not entirely replace living specimens, it must have been an immense advantage to be able to see forms of flowers, their leaves and the growing patterns of stems and branches throughout the year, especially in winter, when it was not possible to observe these from life. Gerlach produced a number of reference books in this genre, including plant forms, trees, examples of wrought iron and other architectural details.\nMartin Gerlach (1846 – 1918) was born in Hanau, Germany and trained as an engraver. He established a jewellery business in the 1860s but this enterprise was unsuccessful. Having become interested in photography, Gerlach started a publishing house in the 1870s in Berlin which produced his reference books and a crafts magazine, Die Perle. He re-located his company to Vienna in 1872 and continued his work there, eventually publishing more than forty books about design and a series of books for children including songs, poems and fairytales.\nBy the end of the 19th century decorative motifs like those celebrated in Festons und Decorative Gruppen, and popular in Europe since Roman times, were soon to be swept away by new ideas and fashions associated with Modernism. Today Gerlach’s plant and vegetable festoons and garlands have almost a contemporary feel to them – it’s not hard to imagine a photographer inspired, perhaps, by carvings or plaster work in a historic house, deciding to re-create them with real materials as a post-modern photographic project. More than one hundred years after publication, this collection of images continues both to inspire and document the complex role of photography in design.\nLinks to source materials below:\nFestoons and decorative groups of plants and animals by Martin Gerlach, Vienna.

46	Why do birds fly high up in the evening?	Common swifts are known to ascend to high altitudes during evening twilight in their breeding season in the northern hemisphere. Scientists have proposed several possible explanations: they might be searching for food (as they feed on aerial insects), or they could be using this time for orientation, since twilight allows them to simultaneously detect landscape features, light polarization patterns, stars and magnetic cues.	"[""The functional significance of many animal behavioural patterns still eludes us. This is true even for the behaviour of the common swift (Fig. 2). It has long been known that during their breeding season in the northern hemisphere, swifts ascend to high altitude in the evening twilight. The common swift spends nearly its entire life on the wing. Foraging, mating and even nocturnal roosting are performed in flight, the latter possibly involving an ability to sleep with only one of the brain hemispheres while the other remains alert. Only breeding birds usually spend the night on the nest. So, up to now, hypotheses about the functional significance of the swifts' twilight ascents have all been related to their nocturnal flight behaviour.\nUntil recently, scientists entertained the hypothesis that during dusk ascent swifts select optimal flight altitudes for roosting. However, earlier work established that swifts do not select altitudes with slow or moderate winds that would minimize energy expenditure during roosting. This is all the more surprising because, so far, swifts are the only species for which scientists have demonstrated an ability to compensate for nocturnal wind drift during migration. The apparent paradox between the ability of swifts to compensate for strong wind drift during migration and their low selectivity for wind drift during roosting only demonstrates that the functional significance of twilight ascent is still not well understood.\nAn alternative possibility that has been mentioned is that the swifts' flights to high altitude at dusk represent foraging decisions because their feeding is entirely dependent on aerial fauna such as insect swarms. Weather at the breeding site is not always favourable for feeding and swifts are faced continuously with movement decisions depending on proper assessment of weather conditions. Another possibility is orientation. Twilight is a key period for combining information from different navigational systems because it allows simultaneous detection of landscape features, light polarization patterns, stars and magnetic cues.\nIn the present issue (pp. ?–?), Adriaan Dokter (University of Amsterdam and Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, The Netherlands), Susanne Åkesson (University of Lund, Sweden), Hans Beekhuis (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute), Willem Bouten (University of Amsterdam), Luit Buurma (Military Aviation Authority, The Netherlands), Hans van Gasteren (Royal Netherlands Air Force, The Netherlands) and Iwan Holleman (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands) use a C-band Doppler weather radar, probably the first usage of an operational weather radar for this purpose, to test hypotheses about the functional significance of the swifts' twilight ascent. The authors employed the weather radar in two modes. The conventional scanning was used to derive altitude profiles of bird density. Altitude profiles were also generated for so called ‘clear air’, which includes insects and aerial plankton. The second, fixed-beam mode was used to record individual wing beat signatures, which allow species identification. The relatively low wing beat frequency in combination with a characteristic pattern of alternating flapping and gliding phases of varying length identifies the birds uniquely as swifts.\nClick here to view the full editorial by Michelle Pellissier Scott (Executive Editor)\nFigure 2.

341	pilots landing gear canyon facts dangers	Early pilots faced numerous challenges related to both landing gear and flying conditions in the Grand Canyon. Initial fixed landing gear designs created significant drag and reduced aircraft performance, with landing gear contributing up to 40% of fuselage drag. In the Grand Canyon specifically, there were widespread beliefs about dangerous conditions, including 'tempestuous air currents' and risks of crashing into canyon pillars. However, Lieutenant Alexander Pearson proved these fears unfounded in 1921 when he successfully surveyed the Canyon, though he did discover that airfields needed to be at least two miles from the rim due to turbulence. He even managed to land at Indian Garden below the Bright Angel Trail, with the main challenge being motor overheating due to hot air at the canyon bottom.	"['The year 1921 stands unique in the history of United States aeronautics. World War I had just ended, and a stimulus of popular curiosity emerged regarding the aircraft that essentially won the war.\nAmerica was uncertain of what would happen with aviation after the war and some believed it would be similar to the emergence of the steamboat and railroad which were at first ridiculed, then doubted and then enthusiastically embraced. Today it would be similar to the introduction of the smartphone.\nIn the years after war, countries worked to push the boundaries of what aircraft could do. In the United States, Americans broke the altitude record by reaching 33,114 feet. Air Service planes flew from New York to Nome, Alaska and back. Americans set new speed records in the Pulitzer race on Thanksgiving Day, and Grand Canyon National Park was surveyed by aircraft for the first time.\nBetween the Army Air Service, Naval Aviation, Aerial Mail and civilian aircraft, Americans logged over 15,250,000 miles in 1920.\nAviator Alexander Pearson\nLieutenant Alexander Pearson became a pilot in the United States Air Service in 1917. During the war, he was a flight instructor for various air fields for the military. After the war, as most squadron members left the Air Service and returned to civilian life, Pearson stayed with the Air Service and became a highly accomplished aviator.\nThe 1920s was the introduction of barnstorming, during which pilots went from town to town demonstrating their piloting skills. Air Service pilots and mechanics were encouraged to engage in barnstorming and air races to help aircraft manufacturers recognize the flaws in their own designs and learn from each other.\nIn October 1918, Pearson entered the first transcontinental air race that took off from Roosevelt Field in Long Island, New York and ended at Crissy Field in San Francisco.\nThe race had 100 entrants — 50 began in New York and 50 began in San Francisco. The race only included Army pilots, recommended by their commanding officers, who all flew de Havilland DH-4 aircraft.\nUsing a Rand McNally Railroad map as a guide, Pearson recorded the fastest actual time, and in turn a world record. He crossed the continent twice in 40 hours. He won a Thermos bottle, a leather flying suit and $825 of liberty bonds.\nPearson was stationed with the 12th Observation Flying Squadron in Douglas, Arizona. There he was utilized by the U.S. Army Border Air Patrol to fly along border between the United States and Mexico to watch for bandits and cattle rustlers.\nIn 1920, Pearson became famous when he was involved in an aviation incident along the U.S. — Mexico border. Pearson had been traveling to Florida for a transcontinental flight from Jacksonville to San Diego, California. His de Havilland DH-4 began having engine trouble and he was forced to land in the shrub and rocks near the Rio Grande River.\nBeing resourceful, Pearson gathered the engine water, once it had cooled, and began traversing the rocky terrain of south Texas.\nA large search ensued, with 65 planes searching the ground for the aviator, and most people feared Pearson had perished in a crash. However, Pearson emerged several days later and reported that beaver trappers with burros helped him ride out of a canyon to a ranch where he eventually made his way to Sanderson, Texas.\nSearchers eventually found his plane, repaired it, constructed a runway and returned the plane to San Antonio, Texas.\nGrand Canyon and Williams\nIn May 1921, Pearson was commissioned to survey the Grand Canyon for possible commercial air travel and mail service. He was to locate landing fields and make observations about air conditions for mail and passenger services between the Union Pacific Railroad in Utah and the Santa Fe Railroad in Arizona.\nAccording to the June 10, 1921 edition of The Williams News, Pearson surveyed northern Arizona for a suitable location to be a base for his surveys. After looking at several airfields in the area, he chose the Williams field as the best field for his purposes.\nAccording to The News, “Arrangements were made for landing at the east side of the field (the old Fair ground). The straightaway was lengthened by taking down the fence at the south of Ed Hoffmeyer’s ranch.”\nBrush had to be cleared away from the east side of the oval race track. Gas and oil were available to Pearson and this field remained the official landing site for Williams until Webber Field was built in 1925.\nThe News reported, “This field, so Mr. Pearson states, offers the best opportunity for landing and taking off, of all the prospective fields in northern Arizona, that he has viewed.”\nAccording to Arizona aviation historian Ruth Reinhold, Flagstaff landing strips at that time were in poorer condition than the Williams fairground track. They were small, surrounded by trees and usually muddy. The poor field conditions, the high altitude and unpredictable weather kept pilots from wanting to land in Flagstaff.\nThe Williams News said airmen had formerly flown near the rim of the Grand Canyon, but Pearson’s attempt to fly across and descend into the Canyon would be a first.\nPearson was inundated with tales of how dangerous flying over the Canyon could be. He was told of the hazardous storms and air currents and was “Almost scared to death of the job that has been assigned to him.”\nOn June 4, Pearson arrived at the Grand Canyon and met with the park’s superintendent. They evaluated possible landing sites near the rim, but the dense forest pushed the best site back 11 miles from the rim. He did find a possible emergency landing strip near the Anita Mine, along the railway.\nPearson returned to Nogales, but headed back north June 9 and landed in Williams and spent several weeks flying around the Canyon and northern Arizona. Williams became his base for his Grand Canyon surveys as he inspected Cataract Canyon and as far west as Seligman. He also circled over Flagstaff, the San Francisco Peaks and north over the Grand Canyon.\nPearson reported that flying over the Grand Canyon was better than he imagined. He reported good conditions and is believed to be the first person to cross the canyon, land on the North Rim and return.\nAccording to Reinhold, Pearson even landed at a small airstrip cleared for him at Indian Garden below the Bright Angel Trail in the Canyon.\nDuring his flights, he descended 3,500 feet below the South Rim and 4,500 feet below the North Rim. He said the only difficulty he found was the motor became very hot because of the hot air at the bottom of the Canyon.\nUntil his historic flights, people assumed flying over the Canyon was too dangerous because of the “tempestuous air currents tumbling into and out of the canyon.” People also believed there was a “danger of being dashed against the upstanding pillars and peak of the canyon,” and “It was impossible to take off from a landing of 9,000 feet above sea level.” He proved all of this was possible in his survey flights.\nIn total, Pearson made 14 flights with a total of 22 hours of flying. He reported many findings, including his recommendation that air fields be at least two miles from the rim because of turbulence from the Canyon’s air currents. He suggested using the air strip at the Anita Mine and using vehicles to haul passengers to the park.\nLife after the surveys\nAfter finishing his surveys, Pearson returned to Douglas, where he married Margaret Shannon and honeymooned at the Grand Canyon.\nIn 1922, Pearson completed another transcontinental trip from Fort Bliss to Portland, Oregon, which he completed in 29 hours.\nPearson was involved in several mishaps and crashes during his aviation career like many pilots during this time in aviation history. He was forced to land on a highway north of Roswell, New Mexico with carburetor trouble in 1922. He had another crash near Ft. Bliss with a propeller malfunction. That same year, he also was forced down in a windstorm west of El Paso.\nPearson went on to participate in stunt fairs and air shows, and attended numerous celebrations to display his aircraft. He broke several speed records and became famed as a stunt flyer.\nOn Sept. 2, 1924, Pearson was making test flights for the Pulitzer Race at Wilbur Wright Field when he died in an airplane crash. He was flying a Curtiss R-8 Navy racing plane at 200 mph when a strut failed and the plane’s wings collapsed.\nAn airfield in Vancouver, Washington was designated Pearson Field in May 1925. The dedication included an air show with over 52 planes and 20,000 people in attendance. The field is currently a municipal airport for the city of Vancouver and is one of the oldest operating airfields in the United States. A museum is dedicated to Pearson at Fort Vancouver National Historic Site.\nMore like this story\n- Williams aviation history Part II: Where was the Spirit of St. Louis?\n- Williams aviation history Part I: Charles Lindbergh makes pit stop in Williams\n- Air show features slice<br>of U.S. aviation history\n- Editorial: Celebrate Museum Month by visiting Planes of Fame\n- Warbirds from the past<br>put on big show in Valle', 'This is an example of a tricycle landing gear that is found in newer aircraft models. This type of landing gear makes the aircraft easy to steer because the nose gear is steerable.\nConventional fixed landing gear consists of two wheels forward of the aircraft\'s center of gravity and a small tail wheel located in the rear. This configuration is nicknamed the ""taildragger. ""\nThe Lockheed Y1C-25 had the same type of ""trouser"" landing gear as the Sirius.\nThe Northrop Gamma shown here, as well as the Alpha and Beta, all produced in the 1930s, had landing gear with streamlined coverings that extended down from the fuselage with the wheels sticking out from the bottom.\nRetractable Landing Gear\nAircraft designers of the 1920s knew that reducing drag on an airplane in flight was important to improving speed and fuel efficiency, as well as maneuverability and controllability. But they still had relatively little understanding of what actually caused drag on airplanes. Various structures obviously caused drag, but they had first to identify the most important sources before they could address them.\nIn 1927, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) opened its new Propeller Research Tunnel (PRT) at Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory in Virginia. The PRT was a very large wind tunnel for the time, with a diameter of 20 feet (6.1 meters). It was designed to allow the testing of an entire airplane fuselage with engine and propeller, as opposed to simply a part of an airplane or a scale model. NACA aeronautical engineers suspected that the aircraft landing gear contributed to much of the drag of an airplane, and the PRT was the first wind tunnel that would allow them to test this.\nLanding gear consists of the wheels that stick out below the fuselage so that an airplane can roll down the runway during landing and takeoff. In early aircraft, they were fixed in an open position so that they protruded at all times, even while the plane was flying and nowhere near the ground. Tests in the PRT immediately demonstrated that landing gear contributed up to 40 percent of fuselage drag, which shocked the researchers. They realized that reducing the drag produced by the landing gear would significantly improve the performance of the airplane in flight.\nThere were several ways to reduce the drag of the landing gear. The two most obvious methods were to either retract the landing gear inside the aircraft or redesign a fixed landing gear so that it produced less drag while still protruding below an aircraft.\nRetracting landing gear were not a completely new idea in the 1920s. J.W. Wartin\'s Kitten, built in 1917, had retractable gear (but could not actually fly). The Dayton Wright RB-1 of 1920 and the Verville Sperry R-3 of 1922 also had retractable gear. But these aircraft were rarities and most airplanes had fixed landing gear at the end of metal struts because they were easy to design, strong, and relatively lightweight.\nWhen designing an aircraft, engineers have always had to address five conflicting requirements. These are: performance, weight, cost, reliability, and maintenance. The best solution to the performance requirement was to pull the landing gear completely inside the fuselage and cover them over, presenting a smooth surface that produced no drag. But while ideal from a performance standpoint, this approach affected all of the other requirements—it weighed more, cost more, was less reliable, and required more maintenance. The wind tunnel data from the PRT caused aircraft designers to look immediately for ways of developing landing gear that provided better performance and hopefully did not have too many other costs associated with them.\nThe Boeing Monomail, which first appeared in 1930, and the Lockheed Orion are generally considered pioneers in the development of retractable landing gear, proving that it was practical. But airplane designer Jack Northrop, who was very interested in streamlining aircraft to improve performance, produced the Northrop Alpha, Beta, and Gamma with fixed landing gear during the 1930s. These aircraft had streamlined coverings that extended down from the fuselage, with the wheels sticking out at the bottom. These were generally referred to as ""trouser"" gear. The Lockheed Sirius, which was built for Charles Lindbergh, had streamlined coverings over the wheels themselves that were referred to as ""pants""-type landing gear. Although trouser and pants gear produced more drag than fully retracted gear, they were still a substantial improvement over uncovered landing gear. More importantly, they were still lighter, cheaper, more reliable, and easier to maintain than the retractable gear. But during the 1930s, numerous designers embraced retractable gear—they were willing to accept the other drawbacks of retractable landing gear simply to achieve the better performance.\nAirplane designers explored numerous ways to retract aircraft landing gear into the fuselage. In some aircraft they were pulled straight up, usually into cowlings behind the engines (as in the DC-1, 2 and 3), sometimes with part of the wheels protruding outside the airplane. In other cases, particularly with smaller aircraft, the struts folded inward so that the wheels fit into the bottom of the fuselage horizontally, sometimes covered with a door to further reduce drag. Some of the drive mechanisms were electric, whereas others were hydraulic. The designers had to ensure that the gear deployed and locked in place. Landing gear that collapsed when a plane landed could cause the plane to tumble out of control and kill the pilot, or at least seriously damage the airplane.\nFor early retractable landing gear not even the performance improvements were clearly achievable, since a retractable landing gear with its motors and associated machinery weighed more than a fixed gear, thereby requiring greater lift from the aircraft and negating some of the benefits of the reduced drag of the retracted gear. While retracting the gear could improve the performance of the plane, it might require a bigger engine and more fuel—not to mention more money.\nIn fact, it was this delicate tug-of-war between the extra weight of the gear and the reduced drag that was most important for the overall acceptance of retractable landing gear. Drag increases with speed and therefore reducing drag becomes more important as an aircraft\'s speed increases. As aircraft speeds continued to increase during the 1930s, particularly as aircraft began to reach speeds of 200 miles per hour (322 kilometers per hour), the increased weight of retractable gear became less important than reducing drag, and retractable landing gear became commonplace to most aircraft.\nToday, many low-speed private aircraft still have fixed landing gear because of cost and maintenance concerns. Some even have the streamlined ""pants"" coverings over their wheels. But virtually all larger and faster aircraft have completely retractable landing gear. Designing such gear presents engineers with a number of problems, particularly how to mount them on the airplane without affecting other parts of the aircraft design. Large commercial airliners like the 747 and Airbus A340 have enough internal volume so that the landing gear can fit inside the fuselage diameter. But some smaller commercial aircraft have to compromise. Their fuselages are so small that fitting the landing gear inside the primary fuselage would result in a large bump inside the cabin that passengers would have to walk over. So their landing gear are often fitted inside bulges that stick outside of the fuselage. This is also common to large military transport aircraft like the C-5 and C-17, which use up every inch of interior space and need long flat floors inside so that tanks and other equipment can be rolled inside.\n--Dwayne A.

60	What hardware components are essential to assemble a CNC machine?	A CNC machine typically requires both electrical and mechanical parts. The essential electrical components include a processor/control board (or PC), stepper shield, stepper drivers, and power supply. For mechanical parts, you need cutting tools, a frame, guides and supports, as well as basic hardware like spacers, washers, nuts, screws, and bolts.	['CNC machines have been around for decades, with their history stretching back to the 1950s. In that time, they’ve transformed the way we manufacture things. They’ve also helped to democratize the process, providing a way for budding engineers and makers around the world to create their own products. With such versatility on offer, you—yes, you!—might be wondering how to build your own CNC machine.\nIf this sounds like you, never fear—the team at Scan2CAD is here to help. We’re here to provide handy tips on building a CNC machine. We’ll include some great options for CNC kits, as well as details and resources covering how to build your own CNC machine from scratch. Let’s get started!\nWhat to look out for\nSo, you’re about to build your own CNC machine. But where do you start?\nBefore comparing kits or choosing components, it’s important to start answering some fundamental questions.\nWhat are you going to make with your CNC machine?\nOf course, CNC machines are versatile, and allow you to create a wide range of different products. However, different types of CNC machine are better for different projects.\nStart by considering the types of projects you’re likely to take on, and use this as a basis for the type of CNC machine you choose. This decision will also inform the components you need to produce your machine.\nHow much time do you have to build the machine?\nThe answer to this question will derive in part from whether you are interested in CNC as a hobby or as a potential business. After all, it’s worth spending longer on your machine if there are possible financial rewards at the end.\nHowever, this isn’t the only factor you should take into consideration. CNC Cookbook recommends that, if this is your first build, that you start with a simpler machine. This way, you’ll be more likely to get it done, rather than biting off more than you can chew and giving up.\nHow much are you looking to spend on your CNC machine?\nMuch as with the above question, your answer here will partly arise from whether you intend to use the machine for professional or personal use.\nIn both scenarios, however, it’s always worth trying to get the most for your money. As such, you should evaluate which parts and components are necessary for the machine you want to build. If you don’t need them, don’t buy them! Set yourself a budget you know you can afford, and stick to it.\nWhat skill sets do you have?\nIt’s easier to build your own CNC machine if you already have some of the necessary skills. As such, aim to complete a project that plays to your experience.\nIf you’re already experienced in woodworking or metalworking, then you may wish to try out a more challenging project. A newcomer, meanwhile, may wish to start out with something simpler.\nA CNC kit is an incredibly convenient way to build your own CNC machine. That’s because a kit generally comes complete with everything you need to put your machine together and get started with making things.\nMost kit manufacturers will also offer a number of customization options. This allows you to choose the right components to suit your needs. You can opt for the most basic package if you’re on a tight budget—or splurge if you have more specific requirements.\nThankfully, here at Scan2CAD, we’ve already put together a list of some great CNC kits for beginners. Featured on the list are:\n- MillRight CNC — though basic, this comes in as one of the cheapest CNC kits on the market. A great option if you’re looking to build your own CNC machine for the first time.\n- Shapeoko — this machine arrives partially assembled, making it one of the easiest projects to complete. If you’re feeling more ambitious, Shapeoko is also hackable, giving you real freedom to modify the machine.\n- Maslow — affordable CNC—bigger. Maslow offers users a massive 4’x8′ workspace, letting you create large projects easily.\n- Next 3D — don’t want to get your hands dirty? The Next 3D offers users the chance to build a CNC machine without soldering, drilling or gluing. Simply screw together and get going in no time.\nLooking for more detail? Check out our full list of the best CNC kits for beginners.\nBuild your own CNC machine from scratch\nUsing a CNC kit is one of the easiest ways to get up and running, but it’s not for everyone. If you’d rather have the freedom to build your CNC machine your way, then building from scratch can be a great option.\nWhat you’ll need\nAs you may have already guessed, there are a vast array of possibilities when it comes to building a CNC machine. However, your CNC machine will likely include most, if not all, of the following parts:\n- Electrical parts, including:\n- Processor/control board (some machines may use a PC)\n- Stepper shield\n- Stepper drivers\n- Power supply\n- Mechanical parts, including:\n- Tools, such as cutting tools\n- A frame\n- Guides and supports\n- Spacers, washers, nuts, screws, and bolts\nOf course, figuring out which type of CNC machine to build will help to clarify which parts you’ll need. If you’re struggling to come to a decision, check out our comparison of CNC machines to find out which one’s right for you.\nThe exact assembly of your CNC machine will depend on the type of machine you choose to build, the custom options you choose, what you plan on making with the machine, and many other factors. Nevertheless, the key steps to build your own CNC machine will generally be as follows:\n1. Design your machine\nCreating a design for your CNC machine will help give you a clear idea on the finished project. You may choose to start out with a sketch, before converting the paper drawing to CAD using programs such as Scan2CAD. From there, you can extrude your 2D drawing into a 3D CAD model in programs such as SolidWorks (or one of our top affordable SolidWorks alternatives).\n2. Get the parts\nOnce you’ve designed your machine, you can then proceed to buying the parts for it. Use the list above as a guideline, but feel free to customize the machine to meet your requirements!\n3. Construct the frame\nYour frame is what holds together all the other parts of your machine. As such, it’s the first construction you’ll perform when you build your own CNC machine. Metals such as aluminum are good choices for your frame, as they will ensure stability and rigidity. This will, in turn, help increase the lifespan of your other hardware.\n4. Add the gantry\nNot all CNC machines will feature a gantry, but as one of the most popular design options, we’ve featured it here. A gantry allows your machining tool to move along the Y-axis; it will hold your tool in place above the workspace. Ensure to balance forces acting on your gantry to reduce the potential of machine deformation or shaking.\n5. Bring in the Z-axis…\nYour tool itself will be moving up and down along the Z-axis. You will, however, need a place to house your tool. You’ll mount this housing to the gantry, giving your tool a greater range of depth.\n6. …then the X-axis\nAdding bearings and guide rails will help to maintain the rigidity of your CNC machine, and will enable your tool to move forwards and backwards along the X-axis.\n7. Drive it!\nNow that you’ve added the parts that will allow your CNC to move forwards and backwards, it’s time to add those that will actually make it move on this axis. This is the drive system, typically made up of motors, pulleys, spindles, screws, bolts and nuts, amongst other parts.\n8. Introduce the electronic parts\nYou’re now ready to add the many electronic parts that will make up the heart of your CNC machine. Key to this is the motor that will, ultimately, drive the machining tool. In this case, you’ll have a choice of stepper and servo motors. However, this is far from the only important tool: you’ll also need to include a PSU, breakout board, drivers, and—of course—a processor or computer.\n9. Put the table top on\nYou can’t machine parts without having a place to put them! Your cutting table can be made of plywood, MDF or metal. Bear in mind, however, that not all of these materials will be suitable for the type of CNC machine you’re creating!\n10. From rotational to linear movement\nThe motor you’ve installed will cause the machine to spin. However, your CNC machine will typically require linear motion. A spindle converts the rotational motion of the motor to linear motion, meaning that your machining tool will be able to move up and down.\n11. Choose your controller\nA CNC controller is vital to the operation of a CNC machine. This is the part that interprets the signals given by your processor or computer, and transforms them into signals for the electronic parts of your CNC machine. As such, it acts as the “brain” of the entire system.\n12. Select your software\nYour machine is now almost operational! First, however, you’ll need to choose the software that controls your CNC machine. Most of these will use languages such as G-code to control the movement of your machine along its three axes, enabling you to perform the action of machining.\n13. Add your machining tool\nThere are a wide variety of machining tools available. Metal cutting tools are one of the simpler varieties, but more elaborate machines may use laser or plasma cutting tools.\n14. Start making things!\nYour machine is now complete, and you’re ready to start tackling your own projects!\nWhy build your own CNC machine?\nIf you’ve read this entire article, then chances are that you’re already sold on the benefits of building a CNC machine. However, if you’re still unsure, we’ll quickly run through some of the best reasons to build your own CNC machine:\n- Customizability. When you buy a CNC machine, it may lack features you need—or make you pay extra for features you don’t. If you build your own CNC machine, you have the ability to choose what (not) to include.\n- Save money. Purchasing a ready-made CNC machine can often set you back thousands of dollars. Building your own CNC machine instead can give you the same results for a much lower cost.\n- Create awesome things. Okay, so this applies to any CNC machine, regardless of whether you buy or build. But it remains true—building a CNC machine gives you the ability to manufacture your own amazing products. Whether you want to launch your own business, replace hard-to-find parts, or simply create custom products that aren’t available anywhere else, you can do it with a CNC machine. And where better to start as a maker than in building your own machine?']	['<urn:uuid:5737044f-d5b5-43b2-8676-ecec9e6dc9b0>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-01T22:47:46.423955	10	51	1834
172	Where did trick-or-treating come from and how much do people spend on it now?	Trick-or-treating originated in Scotland and Ireland where poor people would visit affluent homes to offer prayers for the dead in exchange for food or money. Today, Americans spend over two billion dollars on Halloween candy annually, with the average consumer planning to spend around $100 on Halloween items including candy, décor, cards and costumes in 2022.	"['As you are busily gearing up to get out and celebrate Halloween with your friends and family, perhaps you’ve actually wondered where on earth did this somewhat bizarre holiday come from? Who thought of trick or treating? Why do we dress up in costumes anyway? For all you curious folks, we’ve compiled a top 10 listing of the most important details of the history of Halloween. The holiday has changed a lot through history but one fact will always remain the same, Halloween is one of the most beloved holidays we celebrate every year and is considered to be the 2nd most commercially successful holiday celebrated in the U.S. As you don your best Halloween costume and hit the streets to do some serious trick or treating, here are some fun facts for you to keep in mind!\nPumpkins: Pumpkins are plentiful in the U.S. and are actually indigenous to the Western hemisphere. Normally harvested in October, pumpkins are most commonly orange, but these members of the gourd family also can be found in green, yellow, white, blue and tan! When the Irish immigrated to the U.S. they had been formerly making lanterns with scary faces in them out of turnips to use on ‘All Hallows Eve’, but they quickly switched to pumpkins because they were far easier to carve than turnips and were more readily available. A Halloween tradition was born!\nJack-o-Lanterns: The legend of the Jack-o-Lantern is actually based on a man named Jack. Legend states that a miserly, angry as well as evil man named Jack liked to play pranks on his fellow townspeople. One day Jack decided to mess with the devil himself and tricked him, trapping him up in a tree. Jack circled the tree trunk with crosses and other religious symbols and would not let the devil escape until he agreed that he would never take Jack’s soul into hell. Of course the devil had no choice but to agree to this bargain and he was allowed to go free. When Jack eventually died, he was far too evil to go to heaven but the devil was true to his bargain and did not take Jack’s soul into hell. Jack was forced to roam the earth for eternity. The devil did leave Jack with an endlessly burning ember, which Jack placed inside a turnip lantern to carry on his way as he eternally searched for his final resting place. The tradition of the lit Jack-o-Lantern carries on to this day!\nHalloween Parties: Back in ancient days, villagers would gather on All Hallow’s Eve for a celebration called Samhain, which marked the end of the Harvest and the beginning of their new year, which was November 1st. Large bonfires would be made and various rituals would be performed around these, including throwing the bones of slaughtered animals into the fire as an offering. This celebration was also thought to honor the dead, which these people believed could roam the earth freely in spiritual form on this night. It became commonplace to dress as one were dead in an effort to fool the spirits in hopes that any malevolent amongst them would leave them alone.\nImmigrants: Most of the traditions we have surrounding Halloween come from the Irish or other European immigrants who brought their ancient customs with them when they immigrated to the U.S. Halloween is an eclectic mixture of customs of the Irish, Catholic and the Romans. In particular, the highly superstitious Celts gave us many of the ideas for what we now know as Halloween. The Celts believed that the lines between the living and the dead were completely blurred on October the 31st and they were fearful of any mischief or problems that might be caused by these spirits when they returned.\nGhosts: Because of the ancient beliefs that the spirits of the deceased were out running rampant on All Hallows Eve, Halloween will always have a close association with ghosts and spirits. Throughout history it has been common to tell ghost stories and folk tales involving spirits around the time of Halloween. These traditions have carried on today and it is common for people to create and visit attractions that are designed to appear ‘haunted’ as part of a way to celebrate Halloween.\nMonsters: Aside from ghosts, over the years many other monsters have become associated with Halloween. Two of the most common are vampires and werewolves. Vampires are part of ancient folklore that tried to explain away why random plagues would cause groups of mysterious deaths in various villages. Superstitious people thought that these deaths must be due to a newly deceased person being actually ‘undead’ and rising from the crypt in order to feast on the blood of the living in order to maintain their life force. Potential werewolves, another mythological being, were picked out from amongst others by features such as uni-brows, hairy palms and having a middle finger that was longer than the other digits.\nCostumes: The first Halloween costumes were made in Ireland and were made of various types of make up and animal heads or skins. These costumes were made in an effort to ward off evil spirits, but during the celebration of All Hallows Eve, were also used in the ceremonies that were performed during various festivities. Fortunes were often told and it was common for various rituals to be performed during this time. Nowadays, although scary costumes are still worn on Halloween, the variety of costumes you will see cover many different categories including superheroes, pop stars, humorous costumes and historical figures as well.\nWitches: The word witch comes from the Old Saxon word ‘wica’, which actually means ‘wise one’. In ancient days, witches were originally considered to be healers who were very familiar with the use of herbs and other remedies to help the sick and otherwise afflicted. As Christianity spread throughout Europe, the church clergy unfairly labeled these ‘healers’, calling them devil worshipers or sorcerers, even though that was hardly the case. Early immigrants that still believed these old ancient superstitions regarding witches brought these rumors with them into the U.S.\nTrick or Treating: In the ancient days of Scotland and Ireland, it was common practice on All Hallows eve for the poor or less fortunate to go to the homes of more affluent people and offer prayers for the dead in exchange for food or money. This practice was once again brought to the states by immigrants and eventually evolved into the custom of trick or treating, as we know it today.\nCandy: Candy is the preferred ‘treat’ of trick or treaters, the most favored of all being chocolate bars. The number one chocolate bar favorite amongst trick or treaters is Snickers. Consumers will spend over two billion dollars on Halloween candy this year. Over twenty five percent of all candy purchased annually in the U.S. is bought for Halloween purposes.\nHalloween is one of the most beloved holidays out there. Knowing a little bit of the facts surrounding its magical history will help you to understand and enjoy it all the more! Happy Halloween!', ""SCENE + HEARD: Today's Read Skeletons, Spellcasting, ‘Stranger Things’ and Spending: A Look at 2022’s Halloween Trends By Gwendolyn Plummer Friday, September 30, 2022 8:30 AM NEW YORK—October has arrived, and for many people that can only mean one thing: Halloween season is in full swing. There are just 30 days until the sweetest and spookiest day of the year, and, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF), Americans are taking full advantage of the witching season. The NRF reported that Halloween spending is back to pre-pandemic levels this year, with Halloween sales up to $10.6 billion in 2022, up from $10.1 billion in 2021. Consumers are planning to spend $100 on average for Halloween candy, décor, cards and costumes; the NRF said that this amount is on par with last year’s record of $103 and is the second highest in the survey’s history. So, if people are spending all that money on Halloween costumes, décor and candy, what exactly are they buying? Each year, Google Trends releases Google Frightgeist, a tool that compiles Google searches and data to determine the most popular Halloween costumes. The 2022 version hasn’t been shared yet, but the 2021 data is still available to peruse. Last year, Google found that “witch” was the trendiest costume, followed by “rabbit,” “dinosaur,” “Spider-Man,” and “Cruella de Vil” rounding out the top five. Frightgeist also lets users toggle between national and local trends, so you can see what your neighbors and coworkers are likely planning to wear this Halloween, too. For this year’s data, we can turn to Spirit Halloween, the U.S.’s largest Halloween retailer. So far, Spirit Halloween’s most popular costumes have been Hocus Pocus costumes, maybe because the classic movie’s highly anticipated sequel releases this weekend. “Witches” in general follow, and the third category is broadly “TV and Movie,” encompassing costumes from cultural phenomena like Stranger Things, Ted Lasso and movie superheroes. The NRF’s research echoes Spirit Halloween’s, reporting that “Spider-Man” is the top trending costume, with “witch” in third place. When it comes to décor, there’s one trend that seems to be taking over the rest: giant lawn decorations. From Home Depot’s famous 12-foot skeleton to oversized jack-o-lanterns and massive inflatable ghosts, bigger is better this season, House Digest suggests. If your style is more understated, though, there are still plenty of options: Hocus Pocus is trending in décor, too, reports House Digest, and so is more subtle Halloween-themed dinnerware that might even be adaptable year-round. All of this Halloween spending echoes a general return to pre-pandemic spending overall, says the NRF’s president and CEO Matthew Shay: “Halloween is an exciting time for many families, and that enthusiasm is reflected in the number of Americans who plan to celebrate the holiday this year. As consumers continue to return to pre-pandemic behaviors, retailers are prepared to meet that demand and help make this holiday a fun and memorable one.” The retail data seems to indicate that Americans are excited for Halloween, and are willing to spend money to celebrate it. For ECPs and retailers, of course, the trending data is great for getting involved on social media or in-office. From Instagram costume contests to 12-foot skeletons in exam chairs, there’s no shortage of ways to adapt this year’s Halloween trends to the optical industry. And with 30 days left to get involved, there’s plenty of time, too. So let’s get spooky.""]"	['<urn:uuid:415ca75b-a9c5-470d-94c4-d87d44fb87fa>', '<urn:uuid:a6fa1997-b69e-4a0b-a604-4785e960d4b9>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-01T22:36:12.692263	14	56	1750
401	How do blazar plasma jets accelerate particles, and what technology detects them at the South Pole?	Blazar plasma jets accelerate particles through magnetic reconnection, which involves rapid breaking and reconnection of magnetic field lines in ionized gas. This process converts magnetic energy into thermal and kinetic energy, accelerating plasma particles to produce ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with energies of 1018 to 1020 electronvolts. These particles are detected at the South Pole by the IceCube telescope, which consists of at least 70 strings of optical detectors deployed in 2.4-kilometer-deep holes drilled into Antarctic ice. Each string contains 60 optical detectors housed in volleyball-sized glass spheres with highly sensitive light detectors and sophisticated electronics.	"['Computer models designed and run by astrophysicists from Brazil and abroad reproduced the generation of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays by a mechanism of magnetic acceleration associated with the activity of blazars—galaxies with an active nucleus that emit an intense jet of plasma (ionized gas) towards Earth. At the center of every blazar is a black hole whose mass is millions or even billions of times greater than the Sun. After consuming the matter it attracts, the black hole blasts a stream of electrically charged subatomic particles perpendicular to its axis of rotation—known as a plasma jet. This stream of ionized matter can travel through space at about 300,000 kilometers per second, close to the speed of light.\nCosmic rays that are accelerated in these environments are the most energetic particles in the Universe. Many particle physicists are interested in determining what types of celestial bodies and processes produce them. “In our simulations, we were able to accelerate low-energy protons inside a turbulent jet using a mechanism known as magnetic reconnection, producing cosmic rays with energies in the order of 1018 to 1020 electronvolts [eV],” says Elisabete de Gouveia Dal Pino of the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics, and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of São Paulo (IAG-USP), coordinator of the group that created the computer model as part of a project funded by FAPESP. “These results support the hypothesis that blazars may be one of the sources of the most extreme cosmic rays.” Data from the studies were presented in two articles published in the Astrophysical Journal in 2021 and are set to be described in new papers later this year.\nThe expression “cosmic rays” refers to electrically charged particles (protons, electrons, and nuclei of atoms) and neutral particles (neutrinos, neutrons, and photons) that are produced in extreme celestial objects and travel through the Universe before eventually reaching Earth. Less energetic examples, such as solar wind, are more abundant and probably arise through phenomena that occur within the Milky Way. Those with more energy are seen less frequently and tend to come from farther away. Particles of the highest energy are generated outside the Milky Way, as has already been verified by the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina, funded by several international agencies, including FAPESP and the CNPq (see Pesquisa FAPESP issue nº 260).\nIn 2005, Dal Pino and American astrophysicist Alexandre Lazarian of the University of Wisconsin, USA, proposed the mechanism of magnetic reconnection as one of the possible ways ultra-high-energy cosmic rays are produced. Magnetic reconnection is characterized by the rapid breaking and reconnection (hence the term) of the magnetic field lines of an ionized gas, as occurs in jets of particles produced by the black holes at the centers of galaxies, including blazars. The process converts magnetic energy into thermal energy (heat) and kinetic energy (accelerating the plasma particles), often resulting in explosions. Phenomena like solar flares (sudden eruptions on the surface of the Sun) and auroras in Earth’s polar regions occur due to rapid reconnection of magnetic field lines. In the case of cosmic rays, it was previously unknown whether the mechanism is strong enough to explain the generation of the most energetic particles in the Universe.\nStudies by Dal Pino’s group suggest that at least in plasma jets produced by blazars, magnetic reconnection appears to be capable of producing extremely energetic cosmic rays. Dal Pino’s team used numerical computer models to generate a system that emulates the behavior of these plasma jets, and then introduced instabilities that led to rapid and turbulent magnetic reconnection. In the simulations, some of which lasted hundreds of hours, the researchers wanted to see whether any particles were able to gain enough speed to be considered ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. According to the group’s work, the answer is yes. “In the simulations, we injected hundreds to thousands of low-energy protons that are accelerated by magnetic reconnection in the turbulent fluid of the jet,” explains Tania Elizabeth Medina Torrejón, a Peruvian physicist currently on a postdoctoral fellowship at the IAG and one of the authors of the articles. “Over time, we saw an exponential growth in the energy of these particles.”\nIn 2018, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, located near the South Pole in Antarctica, recorded the first documented source of high-energy neutrinos associated with blazars, a type of particle that can only be produced by protons with extremely high energy. The superaccelerated particles came from a blazar named TXS 0506+056, about 5.7 billion light-years from Earth, where a black hole emits a jet of plasma toward Earth (see Pesquisa FAPESP issue nº 270). “This blazar also generates strong gamma-ray and neutrino emissions. We recently reconstructed these emissions using the magnetic reconnection acceleration model,” says Mexican astrophysicist Juan Carlos Rodríguez-Ramirez, another postdoctoral fellow in the IAG group. The production of gamma rays is set to be studied in detail by the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), designed to be the largest ground-based astronomical instrument for observing of this type of radiation. The CTA is a €350-million project, led by Europeans with the participation of astrophysicists from Brazil (see Pesquisa FAPESP issue nº 312).\nInvestigation of high energy phenomena and astrophysical plasma: Theories, numerical simulations, observations, and development of instrumentation for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) (nº 13/10559-5); Grant Mechanism Thematic Project; Principal Investigator Elisabete de Gouveia Dal Pino (USP); Investment R$14,836,626.42. 17/12188-5.\nMEDINA-TORREJÓN, T.

Comprising a total of at least 70 such strings, the $272 million telescope will be the largest scientific instrument ever built. Designed to detect cosmic neutrinos – ghost-like high-energy particles from deep space – it will open up a new window to the sky and allow scientists to investigate the still-mysterious sources of cosmic rays.\nIceCube is a joint international effort involving more than 20 institutions from the USA, Germany, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Great Britain, Japan and New Zealand. German contributors are the research center DESY with its location in Zeuthen close to Berlin, and universities in Berlin, Dortmund, Mainz and Wuppertal. The major part of the telescope and its construction is being financed by the National Science Foundation (NSF), with $30 million in support coming from European partners.\nIn a common effort, DESY and the German universities will deliver more than a quarter of the around 4200 optical modules that are to be deployed over the next six years. 1300 volleyball-sized glass spheres, each of them housing a highly sensitive light detector and sophisticated electronics, will be assembled and tested at DESY in Zeuthen. “The first IceCube string, which was successfully lowered into the ice in late January, already comprises eight optical modules produced in Zeuthen,” says physicists Rolf Nahnhauer, who is responsible for the production of the modules at DESY. Setting the string into the Antarctic ice required drilling a 2.4-kilometer-deep hole using a novel hot-water drill. “The detectors are then frozen in place in the ice,” explains Nahnhauer. “The first string is working perfectly, and data from the string and the surface tanks is now being transmitted to the Northern Hemisphere.”\nPetra Folkerts | alfa\nDiving robots find Antarctic seas exhale surprising amounts of carbon dioxide in winter\n16.08.2018 | National Science Foundation\nDiving robots find Antarctic winter seas exhale surprising amounts of carbon dioxide\n15.08.2018 | University of Washington\nNew design tool automatically creates nanostructure 3D-print templates for user-given colors\nScientists present work at prestigious SIGGRAPH conference\nMost of the objects we see are colored by pigments, but using pigments has disadvantages: such colors can fade, industrial pigments are often toxic, and...\nScientists at the University of California, Los Angeles present new research on a curious cosmic phenomenon known as ""whistlers"" -- very low frequency packets...\nScientists develop first tool to use machine learning methods to compute flow around interactively designable 3D objects.

It is the first major art museum (over $200 million endowment) to open in the United States since 1974. Over $317 million of the project\'s cost has been donated by Alice Walton. A 2013 Forbes\' ranking of the world\'s richest people placed the Wal-Mart heiress at No. 16, with an estimated net worth of $26.3 billion.\nIn 2005, art historian John Wilmerding was hired for acquisition and advice on museum programming. Wilmerding commented that Alice Walton ""will not spend at any cost"" and will do her ""homework on almost every individual acquisition and will ask for paperwork on market comparables"". He stated that often when an artwork became available through a private sale Walton would state ‘Wait, it will come to auction where we can get it at a better price,’ and she was usually correct. He also stated that the museum ranks at least in the top half dozen of American art museums. The museum\'s ""quality and its range and depth already place it among one of the very best.""\nHeadlines were generated after delays in construction and considerably higher costs for the museum than originally proposed to the city of Bentonville, Arkansas led to concerns about the favorable tax exemptions granted to the museum from the state in 2005 to secure its construction. Total tax losses to the state of Arkansas and the city of Bentonville are estimated at $17 million based on the financial disclosures given by the museum in the 2008 court case with Fisk University. The total amount of tax loss is estimated to have become considerably higher since then, but may never be disclosed due to the museum\'s guarded financial practices, including its decision not to disclose the amount spent since 2008 to secure collections, major art pieces, and lesser known works. However, the museum\'s IRS Form 990-PF notes acquisitions of $43.6 million during 2008, $81.9 million during 2007, $97.3 million in 2006. Through 2008, the total art acquisitions were at least $222.8 million.\nDon Bacigalupi was appointed director of the museum in August 2009. Previously, Robert G. Workman had served as director. In early May 2011, the museum announced three endowments by the Walton Family Foundation totaling $800 million. These endowments were established for operating expenses, acquisitions and capital improvements. The operating endowment, totaling $350 million, is being used to contribute to the museum\'s base annual operating expenses expected to total between $16–20 million per year. The acquisition endowment, totaling $325 million, will be used to fund additions to the museum\'s permanent collection. The remaining $125 million will be used as a capital improvement endowment to fund future improvements to and maintenance of the museum.\nCollaboration with other museums and institutions\nIn the past few years, Crystal Bridges has been in the news for numerous arrangements and partnerships with other art museums to share collections.\nIn 2006, the museum partnered with the National Gallery of Art in an attempt to purchase Thomas Eakins\' The Gross Clinic from Thomas Jefferson University. Under the terms of the agreement, the two museums agreed to pay a record $68 million, but the university gave Philadelphia 45 days to match the offer. The Philadelphia Museum of Art and Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts agreed to collectively match the offer and the painting remained in Philadelphia. The purchase forced both museums to sell some of their best Eakins pieces including Cowboy Singing and the The Cello Player. In April 2007, Crystal Bridges acquired another Eakins belonging to Thomas Jefferson University entitled Portrait of Professor Benjamin H. Rand for an estimated $20 million\nWalton held talks with Randolph-Macon Woman’s College in Lynchburg, Virginia in spring of 2007. The college was exploring selling part of the Maier Museum of Art\'s collection, but voted instead to sell select items from the collection at Christie\'s.\nIn 2006, Fisk University agreed to sell a 50% stake in a 101 piece Stieglitz collection to Crystal Bridges for $30 million. The collection was donated to the university by Georgia O\'Keeffe in 1949. This agreement became tied up in a legal battle between Fisk and the Georgia O\'Keeffe Museum in New Mexico, but the museum withdrew its lawsuit. The Tennessee Attorney General attempted unsuccessfully to stop the sale. In October 2010, a judge ruled that a 50% stake in the collection could be sold to Crystal Bridges if modifications to the contract were made so that Fisk University could not lose its interest in the collection, nor could the joint venture holding ownership of the collection between Fisk University and Crystal Bridges be based in Delaware (or outside Tennessee Courts). The modified agreement would allow the works to stay at Fisk University until 2013 and then begin a two-year rotation with Crystal Bridges. In April 2012, the Tennessee Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision to allow the sale to move forward. A few months later on 2 August, The Davidson County Chancery Court approval a Final Agreed Order that establish joint ownership between Fisk and Crystal Bridges through the newly established Stieglitz Art Collection, LLC. The operating agreement required Fisk to set aside $3.9 million of the $30 million sale proceeds to be used to establish a fund for the care and maintenance of the collection at the Carl Van Vechten Gallery at Fisk. The court dispute cost Fisk $5.8 million in legal fees.\nCrystal Bridges has announced a four-year collaboration with the musée du Louvre in Paris, High Museum of Art in Atlanta, and the Terra Foundation for American Art. The resulting exhibitions, featuring works from the collections of all four partners, will be seen in Paris, Bentonville, and Atlanta, beginning in 2012.\nThe museum\'s permanent collection features American art from the Colonial era to contemporary work. All of the featured artists are United States citizens, though some spent most of their art careers in Europe. Notable works include a Charles Willson Peale portrait of George Washington as well as paintings by George Bellows, Jasper Cropsey, Asher Durand, Thomas Eakins, Marsden Hartley, Winslow Homer, Eastman Johnson, Charles Bird King, John LaFarge, Stuart Davis, Romare Bearden, Norman Rockwell, Mary McCleary, Agnes Pelton, and Walton Ford. Also included are works by Chuck Close, Jasper Johns, Alfred Maurer, Jackson Pollock and Tom Wesselman. Two works, Richard Caton Woodville\'s War News from Mexico and Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait\'s The Life of a Hunter: A Tight Fix were included in American Stories: Paintings of Everyday Life, 1765–1915, a traveling exhibition organized by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Woodville painting was deaccessioned by the National Academy of Design, and was purchased in 1994 by Detroit collector Richard Manoogian. The piece was later purchased in 2004 by Crystal Bridges.\nIn May 2005, the museum purchased a coveted Asher B. Durand landscape entitled Kindred Spirits from the New York Public Library for more than $35 million in a sealed auction. In September 2012, the museum announced the acquisition of a major 1960 painting by Mark Rothko entitled No. 210/No. 211 (Orange). The abstract expressionist painting had been in a private Swiss collection since the 1960s and had only been shown in public twice.\nSculpture also figures prominently in the collection, on view in interior galleries and along outdoor sculpture trails. Sculptors represented in the permanent collection include Paul Manship, Roxy Paine, Mark di Suvero, and James Turrell.\nSelect auction results by date for items in the collection (including buyer\'s premium) are:\n- Green River, Wyoming by Thomas Moran, purchased 5 December 2002 for $2.9245 million\n- George Washington by Charles Willson Peale, purchased 18 May 2004 for $6.1675 million\n- Robert Louis Stevenson and his wife by John Singer Sargent, purchased 19 May 2004 for $8.8 million\n- Orca Bates by Jamie Wyeth, purchased 19 May 2004 for $360,000.\n- Portrait of Anne Page by Dennis Miller Bunker, purchased 1 December 2004 for $3.592 million\n- A French Music Hall by Everett Shinn, purchased 1 December 2004 for $7.848 million\n- The Indian and the Lily by George de Forest Brush, purchased 1 December 2004 for $4.824 million\n- The Studio by George Bellows, purchased 1 December 2004 for $2.472 million\n- Spring by Winslow Homer, purchased 1 December 2004 for $2.024 million\n- Ottoe Half Chief, Husband of Eagle of Delight by Charles Bird King, purchased 1 December 2004 for $1.352 million\n- Wai-Kee-Chai, Sanky Chief, Crouching Eagle by Charles Bird King, purchased 1 December 2004 for $792,000\n- Portrait of Carolus Duran by John Singer Sargent, purchased 2 December 2004 for $724,300\n- Sick Puppy by Norman Rockwell, purchased 2 December 2004 for $511,500\n- George Washington (The Constable-Hamilton Portrait) by Gilbert Stuart, purchased 30 November 2005 for $8.136 million\n- Mrs. Theodore Atkinson, Jr. by John Singleton Copley, purchased 30 November 2005 for $3.376 million\n- Marquis de Lafayette by Samuel F.

315	I live in Mali. How much has rainfall decreased here in the past 50 years?	In Mali, average rainfall has decreased by about 200 millimeters over the past 50 years.	['Africa’s climate already poses grave risks to the continent’s people and economies, and global warming promises to intensify the problem. A factual risk-management solution can help.\nEven before global warming became an issue, many African countries were unusually vulnerable to floods, droughts, and heat waves. Indeed, if there were to be no further change in Africa’s climate, its current state already presents grave risks to the continent’s people and economies. Global warming could trigger more frequent and severe weather disasters, shifts in rainfall patterns and climate zones, and rising sea levels.\nFor African nations, adapting to these possibilities is an urgent necessity. To do so, their leaders must answer some difficult questions. What climate-related losses could these economies sustain over the coming decades? How much can be averted and through what measures? Which investments will be required to finance them? Will the benefits outweigh the costs? We believe that such questions can be answered systematically through a factual risk-management approach that African leaders can use to assess climate’s impact on their countries and to find ways of minimizing it at the lowest cost to society.\nKnowledge about future climate trends—particularly their local impact—is incomplete, so policy and investment choices must be made under uncertainty. Yet enough is known to build plausible climate change scenarios as a basis for these decisions, even in developing countries. Such scenarios can help decision makers to identify adaptation measures useful against a range of climate change outcomes. Cost-effective responses can address much of the identified risk: depending on the country studied, 40 to 70 percent of the losses expected by 2030 could be averted—even under severe climate change scenarios—through adaptation measures whose economic benefits outweigh their costs. In almost all cases, however, at least some risk cannot be averted through known measures.\nMany adaptation measures would strengthen economic growth in developing countries; in Mali, for instance, climate-resilient agricultural development could generate millions of dollars annually in additional revenues. Measures with demonstrated net economic benefits could also attract investments and trigger valuable new innovations and partnerships. Indeed, well-targeted, early investments to improve climate resilience—through infrastructure development, technological advances, capacity improvements, new systems and behavior, and risk transfer measures—will probably be cheaper and more effective for the world community than complex disaster relief efforts after the event.\nA fact-based approach can provide valuable input into the overall decision-making process. Among other things, it recognizes the importance of cost–benefit considerations, makes it possible to put “price tags” on current and future climate risks, and lets decision makers develop plans to help businesses adapt to them.\nMali: Climate zone shift\nIn northwestern Africa, stretching deep into the Sahara, Mali is a mostly dry nation, subject to frequent droughts. Increasing temperatures and decreasing rainfall tell of a shift in climate zones as the desert moves south over productive land. In these regions, farmers dependent on agriculture and livestock already face trying periods of drought and have few options to overcome them. Many are moving to the cities, others to the country’s less arid south. Our study focused on Mopti, an important agricultural area in the central region.\nMali has a wide variety of natural environments, ranging from a Saharan climate in the north to the more tropical south. From year to year, its rainfall levels are among the world’s most variable. Annual floods during the rainy season in the Niger River’s interior delta benefit agriculture but may harm local populations (Exhibit 1). Mali also faces additional hazards from climate change: drought is expected to increase in frequency and severity, weakening the country’s agriculture and GDP. The climate zone shift—the combined effect of rising average temperatures and declining average rainfall—has already pushed the country’s agroecological zones to the south over the past 50 years, with average rainfall down by about 200 millimeters and average temperatures up by 0.5°C over the same period.\nDesertification and climate zone shift have multiple causes, with complex interactions. The impact from climate change is aggravated by farming and domestic practices, such as slash-and-burn agriculture (which erodes the soil) and deforestation, mostly to meet 90 percent of Mali’s cooking and heating requirements. (Forest cover has decreased by almost 50 percent since the 1980s.) Nonetheless, local adaptations could eliminate a significant share of the loss due to climate change, and it is important to recognize that farmers have already developed the kinds of techniques that will help them cope. Diversity in crop cycles—already widely practiced by Malian farmers—will be essential. Genetic variation in plants helps to make agriculture in areas with higher climate risks more resilient to them. Also advantageous will be the farmers’ tendency to spread out geographically for access to different types of soils and water sources.\nIn 2006, the value of Mali’s crops and livestock was estimated at $840 million and $620 million, respectively. Projections to 2030 take into account the most valuable agricultural crops (cotton, maize, millet, rice, and sorghum) and livestock (for eggs, meat, and milk). Following historical expectations, the five main crops’ value would increase by 46 percent, to $1,220 million (1.6 percent annual growth). In a more optimistic scenario, that level would more than double, to $2,470 million (4.6 percent annual growth).\nScenarios and responses\nThe significant uncertainty about climate change has spawned a range of climate projections for rainfall, while temperatures are consistently projected to increase significantly. Local climate models allowed us to consider three scenarios for a climate zone shift by 2030. Under the moderate-change one, temperatures would rise by 1.2°C and annual rainfall would decrease by 2.2 percent. The high-change positive scenario projects an increase in rainfall and temperatures of 8.1 percent and 0.9°C, respectively, while the high-change negative scenario anticipates a decrease in rainfall of 10.6 percent and an increase in temperatures of 1.4°C. Under all three, Mali would suffer economic losses by 2030. The pessimistic high-change scenario could involve losses of about $300 million annually (some 15 percent of the value of agriculture and livestock); the optimistic scenario, losses of $120 million annually (6 percent).\nThese losses will probably be offset, to some extent, even in the absence of specific adaptation measures. Agricultural production in Mali is likely to increase in value through the encouragement of farming in the regions best suited to it and the promotion of the right mix of crops. The human migrations required should happen naturally. Still, such measures would not cover the full expected climate-related economic decline.\nMeasures to increase productivity by encouraging the development of assets primarily in the most promising areas could compensate for losses elsewhere. Simulations show that by 2030, a migration of one million people could raise agricultural production by 6 percent more than population growth spread evenly across regions would. The migration of 1.5 million people by 2030 could raise production by an additional 8 percent—an overall 14 percent increase compared with the base case. But such controversial measures might promote conflict and increase competition for resources. Infrastructure and asset-based measures could make semi-arid areas substantially more resilient, however, so accelerated migration isn’t essential.\nSuch measures depend on the specifics of each natural environment, so we assessed a few promising possibilities for the Mopti region (in the middle of the country), which well represents Mali’s diverse agroecological zones. The southwest of Mopti, near the Niger River’s internal delta, is suitable for rice cultivation, horticulture, fishing, and livestock. The east and north, with a hotter and drier climate typical of the Sahel (the region on the fringe of the Sahara), is more appropriate for dry crops such as millet and sorghum—and threatened by the desert’s advance and the struggle to find water.\nAsset-based adaptation measures, such as soil techniques, irrigation systems, and the provision of additional water for cattle, would help to “climate proof” yields. Of the measures reversing the losses, about three-quarters would have benefits higher than their costs. Other measures would generate additional agricultural revenues—for instance, by extending the land area suited to horticulture, providing for two harvests a year rather than one, or encouraging additional products and practices (for instance, by mixing agriculture and forestry in crop fields). The generation of new revenue, essentially another adaptation alternative, has massive potential but requires careful consideration of its secondary effects on society. For the Mopti region alone, revenue-generating cash crops could cover much if not all of the expected loss for the entire country. In other words, these measures are essentially economic-development activities.\nEnablers and barriers\nMany measures we identified are labor-intensive, so the availability and use of local workers can constrain both the potential and the speed of deployment. Labor is an additional cost, but nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) often finance measures in exchange for free work by farmers. Since machinery frequently produces better cost–benefit ratios, however, the desire to help the local workforce must be weighed against the advantages of using more efficient but expensive machines. Building local water holes for livestock close to villages during the dry season, for example, can take two months for a team; a bulldozer can dig one in a day. The workforce is usually idle during the dry season, though, so the choices are quite complex.\nThe many cost-effective measures—which were analyzed, through local experiences and suggestions, and which make sense from a purely developmental perspective—should be led by the players typically involved. Government engagement will be required for larger-scale infrastructure measures, such as irrigation in the delta. NGOs are likely best suited for smaller-scale measures. International institutes can provide important expertise on issues such as crop engineering and meteorology. Given the complexity and magnitude of the challenges, support from the international community will be critical.\nAn effective portfolio of climate resilience measures can be assembled at limited cost. The key is to create the right enabling environment to provide for effective adaptation to climate change as well as economic development.\nTanzania: The impact of drought\nDuring the past 30 years, Tanzania has experienced six major droughts. The most recent, in 2006, is estimated to have cut GDP growth by 1 percent. Two specific effects of drought are of special concern. The first is the threat to human health posed by malnutrition and the spread of cholera and other water-borne diseases resulting from fresh-water shortages. Second, power generation in Tanzania depends predominantly on hydroelectric plants; during the 2006 drought, for example, the country faced severe power rationing because of a shortfall of water in reservoirs.\nOur study focused on the drought-prone central regions (Dodoma, Singida, and Tabora)—where various local climate models allowed us to build realistic scenarios for climate evolution. Under the moderate-change scenario, these regions are projected to experience a 10 percent decrease in annual rainfall and a 25 percent increase in the variability of the amount of rainfall—changes that would lead to more severe and frequent droughts. Under the high-change negative scenario, rainfall would decline by 20 percent and variability increase by 50 percent.\nThe central regions are primarily rural, and a majority of their 4.4 million inhabitants are poor subsistence farmers. This population faces a range of serious drought-related health risks: for example, in 2003 a survey reported that 19 percent of children under five had suffered from diarrhea during the previous two weeks to the survey. Hydropower generation is also critically important in the central regions: the Kidatu and Mtera dams, located in or near them, contribute 50 percent of Tanzania’s hydropower production capacity.\nHealth: Effects and adaptation measures\nThe most important drought-related diseases prevalent in the central regions are cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, malnutrition, and trachoma (which causes blindness). By 2030, even if the frequency or intensity of droughts doesn’t change, 5 percent of the regions’ population is projected to endure hunger from poor yields; the same percentage will suffer from trachoma. Cholera and dysentery will be common as well, and diarrhea will afflict almost 200,000 children under five.\nIn the moderate-climate-change scenario, by 2030 a 10 percent decrease in average rainfall levels could raise the proportion of the population under food stress by 60 percent, with a significant increase in the number of cases of cholera and dysentery. Trachoma cases could double. The high-climate-change scenario worsens the prognosis, particularly for trachoma.\nOur study analyzed measures that could protect Tanzanians against drought-related health risks. Some are preventive: for instance educational programs for hygiene, sanitation, and breastfeeding; the building of covered wells with pipes and ventilated pit latrines; and the harvesting of rainwater. Others are treatments, such as oral rehydration therapy and the administration of antimicrobials and zinc supplements.\nIt will not always be easy to distinguish spending for adaptation to climate change from development spending on health. Water access measures, for instance, could prevent thousands of cases of cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, and trachoma but could be considered sound policy no matter how the region’s climate evolves. Health spending should become more forward-looking rather than reactive.\nPower generation: Impacts and adaptation\nIn 2030, Tanzania is predicted to rely on hydropower for more than half of its electricity. Ninety-five percent of this hydropower will come from the central regions, but drought will decrease the water flow in rivers and thus cut the amount of electricity generated. The Tanzania Electricity Supply Company will have to make greater use of more expensive natural gas and coal—thus also increasing greenhouse gas emissions—or cut the supply of electricity. In the latter case, companies with diesel generators will bear the extra cost of using them, and the production of other 40 percent will fall.\nIn the high-change negative scenario, the expected losses would cut the national GDP by 1.7 percent in 2030. Even in the moderate-climate-change scenario, GDP will fall by 0.7 percent, solely because of climate change–induced droughts. Tanzania could close most of the expected shortfall in power production if it were to implement energy efficiency measures, such as reducing demand by encouraging less (or more careful) usage in the residential and commercial sectors—moves that would save more money than they would cost. In addition, reducing spillage at hydro stations could significantly increase the power supply almost free of charge. No-regrets energy efficiency measures such as these could be implemented immediately.\nWe do not know how much or how soon the global climate will change because of rising greenhouse gas emissions, but we do know that a country’s ability to cope with climate change will depend on its socioeconomic position. The poorest developing economies face especially difficult challenges both in addressing their current climate risks and adapting to new ones. For them, linking climate responses with economic-development strategies will be vital. A fact-based approach that considers both costs and benefits can help.']	['<urn:uuid:1ffc3654-ce67-4c2c-9fa3-80cb3775f998>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-01T23:21:14.341336	15	15	2421
232	how many residents michigan wind farm opt out	More than 50 residents signed documents requesting to be removed from the commercial wind overlay district, with signatures dated between April 6 and April 14. According to Jeff Smith, the county's building and zoning director, the county has never had so many opt-outs.	['BAD AXE – The county is considering lawyering up in response to a list of more than 50 residents asking to be excluded from an area being primed for a batch of 50 to 70 wind turbines.\nCounty attorney Stephen Allen this week said county commissioners should hire outside legal counsel to determine whether allowing that many residents to opt out would create spot zoning.\nSpot zoning, which many sources say is generally a bad practice, can occur when officials zone a small area or parcel for uses contrary to surrounding areas.\nThe zoning could conflict with a county’s master plan and allow for land use not afforded to the large majority of nearby parcels.\nPut simply, officials say it creates a zoning area that looks like Swiss cheese.\nSpot zoning is typically ruled invalid if challenged in court, according to the nonprofit Michigan Association of Planning. Michigan’s Zoning Enabling Act of 2006 and Planning Enabling Act of 2008 make no mention of the term.\nJohn Nugent, a county commissioner and planner, says there will be a resolution on the board of commissioners’ agenda next week to spend up to $2,500 to clarify whether Huron’s scenario would create spot zoning.\nNugent says the list of residents wanting out of the project creates an “extraordinary situation.”\nDocuments included in a packet for a board of commissioners meeting read: “We the undersigned residents of Lincoln Township hereby request to be removed from the commercial wind overlay district. Signed April 2016.”\nThe documents list more than 50 signatures with addresses, dated between April 6 and April 14. Some are from landowners already under easement with DTE, including Lincoln Trustee John Wisneski.\nJeff Smith, the county’s building and zoning director, says the county has never had so many “opt-outs.”\nSmith also asked why some who signed leases with DTE now want out of the project, without giving explanation – considering some may have already cashed checks, he said.\nAllen says he’s worked as corporate counsel for the board of commissioners since 1999, but that he doesn’t get involved in the wind energy overlay process. He advised the county seek Detroit-based Clark Hill PLC for legal counsel.\nDTE Energy is in early stages to build 50 to 70 turbines across four townships.\nA project planning area covers 61 square miles and more than 39,000 acres – 22,000 in Lincoln Township. DTE says it has 21,000 acres under contract for wind development with about 100 landowners and is talking with other landowners.\nDTE says its plan far exceeds county requirements.\nProject Manager Matt Wagner says Allen’s advice applies to site plan review, a stage that planners aren’t at.\n“I have no doubt that we’ve met the requirements,” Wagner told county planners.\nMember Terry Heck asked how “overwhelming opposition” factors in if all planning and zoning requirements are met.\n“It doesn’t matter if people … don’t like it,” Allen said.\nIf all requirements are met and officials make a decision based on reason, “they’re stuck with it,” he said. Disallowing the project in such case would be capricious, according to Allen.\nHowever, officials noted the option of a referendum, which a resident may initiate by collecting signatures within the zoning jurisdiction to reverse such a decision.\n“People always have the final say,” Planning Vice Chair Bernie Creguer said.\n|Wind Watch relies entirely\non User Funding']	['<urn:uuid:cc6dfe54-6374-4877-b491-b3c7171b77e6>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-01T22:36:12.692263	8	43	558
173	institutional investor comparing gold palladium stability profit margin	Gold shows more price stability compared to palladium during market fluctuations. When prices fall, gold remains steadiest while palladium is hardest hit. This is evidenced by gold's modest 20% decline from its peak in 2022, compared to palladium's dramatic 80% drop from $3,440.7 to $1,854 per ounce. Additionally, GOLD stocks show a net profit margin of 3.91% with current earnings growth of 18.52%.	['A block trade is a significant transaction involving the buying or selling of securities that is conducted privately, away from the public markets. Its purpose is to minimize the impact on the price of the security. Typically, block trades are carried out by hedge funds and institutional investors through investment banks and other intermediaries. However, high-net-worth accredited investors may also have the opportunity to participate in these trades.\nAccording to the criteria set by the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, a block trade involves a minimum of 10,000 shares of stock or a value exceeding $200,000. For instance, in the present scenario, a block trade is taking place involving GOLD. The trade consists of 964,472 shares being exchanged at a price of $16.32 per share, which is slightly higher than the ask price of $16.31. To maintain confidentiality and disguise the true magnitude of the trade, it is likely that different brokers will be involved in executing this transaction.\nIt should be noted that the specific exchange on which this block trade is occurring has not been specified in the information provided. Nonetheless, the CME Group offers the opportunity to execute block trades for futures, options, or combination transactions that are permitted to be conducted separately from the public auction market.\nBarrick Gold Corporation\nUpdated on: 28/09/2023\nDebt to equity ratio: Buy\nPrice to earnings ratio: Strong Sell\nPrice to book ratio: Strong Buy\nDCF: Strong Buy\n12:00 PM (UTC)\nDate:28 September, 2023\n|Analyst / firm||Rating|\nBank of America Securities\nGOLD Stock Performance: Mixed Results on September 19, 2023 with Positive Turnaround in Earnings Growth\nOn September 19, 2023, GOLD stocks experienced mixed performances. The previous close for GOLD stocks was at $16.68, and today’s open was slightly higher at $16.72. Throughout the day, the stock fluctuated within a range of $16.20 to $16.75. The trading volume was 14,976,724, which is higher than the average volume of 13,188,653 over the past three months.\nLooking at the company’s financials, GOLD has shown a significant decline in earnings growth over the past year, with a decrease of 78.54%. However, there has been a positive turnaround this year, with earnings growth of 18.52%. Looking ahead, the projected earnings growth for the next five years is a modest 2.00%. The revenue growth for the previous year was -7.40%, indicating a decline in sales.\nIn terms of valuation, the P/E ratio is not available (NM), suggesting that the company may have negative earnings. The price/sales ratio is 2.74, which indicates that investors are willing to pay $2.74 for every dollar of sales generated by the company. The price/book ratio is not provided, so it is difficult to assess the company’s value based on its book value.\nTaking a closer look at the individual stock performances, Newmont Corporation (NEM) experienced a decrease of $0.16, which translates to a decline of 0.41%. Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (AEM) also saw a decrease of $0.50, representing a decline of 1.00%. Gold Fields Ltd (GFI) had a smaller decrease of $0.08, resulting in a decline of 0.65%.\nLooking ahead, the next reporting date for GOLD stocks is set for November 9, 2023. Analysts forecast an EPS of $0.27 for this quarter. The net profit margin for GOLD stocks is 3.91%, indicating the company’s ability to generate profit from its revenue.\nGOLD operates in the Non-Energy Minerals sector and falls under the Precious Metals industry. The corporate headquarters of GOLD is located in Toronto, Ontario.\nOverall, GOLD stocks had a mixed performance on September 19, 2023. While there was a slight increase in the stock price at the opening, it fluctuated within a range throughout the day. The company’s financials show a decline in earnings growth over the past year, but there has been a positive turnaround in the current year.

Therefore, it is advisable to consult up-to-date sources and seek professional advice before making any investment decisions.', 'Precious metals analyst Sanjiv Arole examines the market forces that are driving palladium’s fortunes.\nAlthough palladium was classified as a precious metal only in 2009, it became the most expensive precious metal in 2019. Palladium has topped $2,300 per ounce (against platinum’s all-time of $2,273 per ounce in 2008) on umpteen occasions. In fact, palladium topped $3,000 per ounce for the first time on 4th May, 2021.\nThe Ukraine war too triggered off a rally in palladium as it scaled a fresh all-time high of $3,440.7 per ounce (intra-day) on 7th March, 2022. Although gold managed to be at par with palladium on a few occasions this year, palladium still remains the most expensive of (non)precious metals in the precious metals basket.\nThe palladium price has gained by over 6% to $2,018 per ounce on 2nd September, 2022 as compared to $1,893 per ounce at the beginning of the year. It was the only precious metal to have gained as of 2nd September this year, while the rest of the precious metals all showed a decline in price as compared to the beginning of the year.\nGold fell by 5.78% to $1.712.50 per ounce while silver decline sharply by 27.34% to $17.92 per ounce, platinum too slipped by 16.07% to $840 per ounce.\nAs Russia accounts for a substantial portion of palladium supplies in the world, the Ukraine war will continue to have an impact on the palladium price in the remainder of the year as well.\nThe crowning glory for palladium in the immediate aftermath of the Ukraine war was when its price scaled an all-time high of $3,440.7 per ounce on 7th March, 2022. In sharp contrast, the palladium prices dipped by a whopping 80% to $1,854 per ounce on 20th July, 2022.\nGold’s decline from its peak of $2,039 per ounce for the year was more subdued at around 20% as gold slumped to $1,694 per ounce on 1st September, 2022. Silver and platinum too declined, by over 47% and 38%, respectively, from their highest to their lowest levels. However, as far as year-to-date prices were concerned, palladium was the only one that remained in positive territory. If one were to look at the average prices, then all the precious metals showed a decline in the average price year-to-date as compared to the average price for the previous year. Gold declined by just over 1%, while palladium fell by 14%. Silver and platinum fell steeply by 23% and 21%, respectively. Overall, it once again supported the view that when the price surges, gold climbs the slowest, while palladium and silver lead the way. But, when prices fall, gold is the steadiest, while palladium and silver are the hardest hit. Platinum is usually between gold and the other high-flyers.\nComing to the fundamentals of palladium as per the Johnson & Matthey PGM Market Report 2022. Some of the salient features for 2021 are:\n(a) Russia is the largest primary palladium supplier accounting for around 40% of mined production. In 2021, Russian mine production was 2,689 thousand ounces.\n(b) In 2021, palladium prices scaled $3,000 per ounce on liquidity concerns following the flooding of mines in Siberia. However, increased supplies from South Africa saw the price slump to below $1,600 per ounce in December.\n(c) High prices incentivised scrap yards to expedite reprocessing palladium-rich catalysts. Secondary supplies increased as a result of the backlog of auto scrap as well. However, as the price declined so did the scrap inflows.\nThe outlook for 2022:\n(a) The Ukraine war has resulted in uncertainty over shipments from Russia in 2022. In fact, J&M has not made any forecasts for palladium supplies from Russia. Then, South African supplies are set to fall in the current year due to plant maintenance, etc.\n(b) Expected weaker car sales to hit recycling of vehicles, less vehicles for scrapping.\n(c) Any recovery in auto PGM demand likely to hit due to supply constraints and Covid-19 restrictions, particularly zero-Covid tolerance in China and the resultant lockdowns there.\n(d) Industrial palladium demand to be hit due to high prices.\n(e) Since Russia is the largest palladium supplier in the world, supply disruption from Russia could give rise to inflation and depress growth. This would be further accentuated with palladium ingots from Russian refineries being unacceptable as ‘good delivery’ bars in London and elsewhere from April 2022.\n(f) Average platinum content of a gasoline car in 2022 is forecast to rise by over 66.6% compared to 2021. Automakers in Europe and North America are set to begin fitting tri-metal catalysts in greater numbers, reflection substitution efforts to replace palladium with platinum. Even China is expected to ramp up substitution. Overall, a tumultuous time for PGM metals, particularly palladium\nMeanwhile, US Fed Chief Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole symposium sent chills across global stock markets as well as commodity markets. The symposium was held from 25th August, 2022 and Powell’s comments on inflation were far more hawkish than anticipated. His overwhelming focus on inflation was reflected in the usage of the word inflation around 44 times in his speech.\nPowell stated that all his efforts would be centred on bringing inflation down to 2% from the current 9%, implying that higher than normal interest hikes would continue till inflation numbers slide down. He added that while higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labour market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses. They are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean greater pain.\nJerome Powell appears to be on the verge of throwing caution to the winds in his relentless pursuit of taming inflation. He seems to be oblivious of the lower GDP growth, higher debt servicing of long-term debt weighing down on the US economy, trade sanctions, Covid-19 hovering around, and the likely harsh winter for most of Europe due to fuel shortages as a backlash against sanctions by Russia and above all the Ukraine war.\nIn his endeavour he has embarked on a path of rapid rise in interest rates to tame inflation. In the game of brinkmanship, he is risking job losses and lower growth giving way to even recession. While higher interest rates could encourage savings account holders, it could hurt the stock markets as well as the precious metals market.\nGold, in particular, would wait with bated breath to see the outcome of the monetary policy statement later in the week. If the Fed continues it hawkish trend (a further substantial hike as in July), then gold could be under enormous pressure of a strong dollar as well as an option for savings in banks accounts. Thereby, gold could sink further along with the rest of precious metals.\nA recovery in the gold price could be seen only when it transpires that inflation cannot be tamed despite the rate hikes or the Fed end the rate hikes citing victory over inflation.\nWill palladium still remain in positive territory even if the Fed continues to hike interest rates? As they say, ‘the proof in the pudding is in the eating’. Wait and watch!']	['<urn:uuid:8074c8dd-940e-423e-ba27-9b7b26fbde95>', '<urn:uuid:f98cd933-b322-4819-92b9-5bf92cde845e>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-01T22:36:12.692263	8	63	2075
