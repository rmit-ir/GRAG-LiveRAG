{"question":"I'm fascinated by Goethe's influence on music. What's the connection to Rachmaninov's First Piano Sonata?","answer":"Rachmaninov's First Piano Sonata was inspired by Goethe's play Faust and its three main characters. The sonata reflects Faust the scholar, his beloved Gretchen, and Mephistopheles, the Devil's emissary. Though Rachmaninov did not openly reveal this program, correspondence suggests this connection, with the three different personalities represented in the three movements.","context":["à la russe - Alexandre Kantorow plays music by Rachmaninov, Stravinsky & Tchaikovsky\nClassical - Instrumental\nRachmaninov: Piano Sonata No. 1\nTchaikovsky: Méditation and Passé lointain from 18 Morceaux, Op. 72, Scherzo a la russe, Op. 1 No. 1\nIgor Stravinsky: Danse infernale, Berceuse & Finale from L’Oiseau de feu (transcr. Guido Agosti)\nMily Balakirev: Islamey, Op. 18\nAlexandre Kantorow (piano)\nAlexandre Kantorow released his first disc for BIS in 2016, performing Liszt’s piano concertos to critical acclaim: ‘I’m here to tell you that Alexandre Kantorow is Liszt reincarnated’ wrote one impressed reviewer, in Fanfare Magazine. Not yet 20 years old, the French pianist and son of violinist and conductor Jean-Jacques Kantorow now explores his Russian roots, in a recital that opens with Rachmaninov’s weighty First Piano Sonata, inspired by Goethe’s play Faust, and its three main characters, the scholar Faust, his beloved Gretchen and Mephistopheles, the Devil’s emissary. The nostalgic intimacy of Méditation and Passé lointain, from Tchaikovsky’s Op. 72 collection, offers respite from the drama, but tension returns with Guido Agosti’s virtuosic piano arrangement of three extracts from Stravinsky’s Firebird.\nKantorow closes his Russian recital with Mily Balakirev’s ‘oriental fantasy’ Islamey, one of the iconic works of the piano literature. Fiendishly difficult, the piece famously inspired Ravel to write something that would be even harder to play (his Gaspard de la nuit). A committed Russian nationalist, Balakirev himself found the inspiration for Islamey during a journey to the Caucasus when he was introduced to the local music tradition.\nReview by Adrian Quanjer - April 26, 2017\nRachmaninov’s first piano sonata clearly is the main item here and whilst I’m not a strong believer of the wisdom to comparing timings, I noticed in the versions at my disposal such a remarkable difference that it made me curious. Compared with the other High Resolution recording listed (Mustonen, Ondine) they may be not all that big (15:16, 9:29, 14:01 for Kantorow and 12:37, 8:52, 13:46 for Mustonen), But in comparison with the Russian pianist, Alexis Weissenberg, who recorded it for DGG (DG 427 499-2) way back in 1986 the difference is huge: 10:16, 6:54, 11:35! What has happened? Big question, simple answer: Rachmaninov revised his first sonata extensively (1931) stripping it from repeats and overelaborated passages. This is the version Weissenberg used; with Kantorow we get the full works.\nBut there is more. The first sonata’s construction in its original score is so terribly complicated - probably one of the reasons why its popularity lags behind that of the second and even other piano compositions of lesser stature - that only pianists with superior technical competence and, even more important, sufficient structural insight to keep it afloat, seem to be able to get it across to the listener in a coherent shape that makes sense.\nAlthough Rachmaninov refrained from revealing its programme, correspondence suggest that the idea behind the sonata is based on Goethe’s Faust, with three different personalities hiding in the three movements. Hence, the music is as devilish as it sounds. The liner notes written by Claude-Henri Joubert are most informative and my advice is to consult them before listening. Be prepared to join the soloist in an unsettling, breathtaking experience, so convincingly carried out and, for me an absolute plus, without becoming a mere ‘key banger’; sensitive emotion running all along his interpretation.\nThis is Kantorow’s second BIS release, and those having heard Kantorow play Liszt’s piano concerti (with his father directing the Tapiola sinfonietta) (Liszt: Piano Concertos - Alexandre & Jean-Jacques Kantorow) will agree that he at 17 is already a phenomenal talent. In Rachmaninov, too, nothing seems to be impossible. He carries the audience through an often abysmal Faust reincarnating first movement into the second, where Gretchen is elegantly depicted in refined, ornamental passage work. This subjective relief only lasts less than ten minutes, but is nonetheless long enough to rearm the passion for the final, Mephistopheles movement, during which Kantorow has to administer all his talent to keep it, together with incorporated elements of the first movement, under tight control in Rachmaninov’s ultimate, drawn-out virtuoso structure. Simply fascinating!\nIn his rendition of the same sonata, Mustonen allows the listener to recoup breath & soul with Tchaikovsky’s ‘Seasons’. Kantorow walks a similar path with two lovely and passionately played ‘Morceaux’ Op. 72, No. V ‘Meditation’ and No. XVII ‘Passé Lointain’, before entering into Guido Agosti’s transcription from ‘L’Oiseau de feu’ by Igor Stravinsky. To be quite honest, I prefer the real thing; the orchestral version. But I must admit that in the powerful & gripping hands of Kantorow it becomes surprisingly bearable and certainly worth one’s while. The more so, because Agosti has managed to integrate the diversity of orchestral colours into the piano score.\nKantorow adds two interesting bonuses: Tchaikovsky’s Opus 1 No. 1 ‘Scherzo à la russe’, based on a Ukrainian folk tune, and part of his first published work: Two Pieces for Piano, Op. 1. The other one is Balakirev’s ‘Islamey’ well-known oriental phantasy written for fidgety Russian virtuoso fingers, like those of Alexandre Kantorow.\nAs far as I have been able to establish, Kantorow has, apart from assorted mini contests at the age of 12-14 or thereabouts, never chosen to participate in a major piano concours (Reine Elizabeth, Tchaikovsky) to get his star advertised. In an interview with ‘Piano Bleu’, a French site for piano lovers, he said envisaging to do so eventually. But will he, after this second release? Some famous musicians never participated in any of those potentially risky make or break events.\nLet me end with a bit of gossip for the francophone community, copied from Piano bleu (text Vincent Bourre): « Je me souviens après avoir vu l’épisode de Tom et Jerry, où Tom joue la Seconde Rhapsodie de Liszt, et avoir demandé Papa de me faire une réduction de la première page pour mes petits mains ». Being only three years old, doesn’t that say it all?\nThe best I can sound wise say is that I listened to a well-tuned, realistically recorded concert grand, including some minor mechanical foot pedal (?) noise, taken in a French studio at Ivry-sur-Seine, with Jens Braun (Take5 Music Production) at the audio workstation.

{"question":"What are the similarities and differences between how hurricanes and tsunamis are classified in terms of their intensity and destructive power?","answer":"Hurricanes are classified into five categories based on their wind speed at landfall (tropical storm, hurricane, major hurricane, category 3, and category 4). In contrast, tsunamis are not classified by their wave height or speed, but rather are ranked according to the amount of damage they cause, as historical data on tsunami wave sizes and frequency is limited.","context":["Hurricanes are hurricane local statement among the most dangerous natural disasters in the United States. They can cause immense damage, loss of life, and displacement of people. In order to help ensure that you and your loved ones are as prepared as possible for a hurricane, we’ve put together a comprehensive guide on how to make a local statement in preparation for one. From stocking up on supplies to creating evacuation plans, this guide has it all. And if you have any questions or suggestions, don’t hesitate to let us know!\nWhat is a hurricane local statement?\nWhat is a hurricane local statement?\nA hurricane local statement is a prepared statement made by a community during or shortly after a hurricane. They are designed to help the public understand what to expect and how to prepare for the storm.\nLocal statements should be updated as new information becomes available, so make sure to check back frequently. Here are some example Hurricane Local Statements:\n1) A hurricane Warning means that a hurricane is imminent and\/or expected within the next 36 hours. Hurricanes can produce wind speeds up to 155 mph and devastating coastal flooding. Please take all necessary precautions!\n2) If you are in an evacuation zone, evacuate now! Katrina demonstrated that once an area has been evacuated, it is very difficult (if not impossible) for residents to return.\n3) Homeowners in low-lying areas should consider moving their vehicles and possessions above ground if possible. Flooding from hurricanes can be deadly for those who do not heed evacuation orders.\nHow are hurricanes classified?\nHurricanes are classified according to their intensity. The five classes of hurricanes are: tropical storm, hurricane, major hurricane, category 3 hurricane, and category 4 hurricane. The intensity is based on how much wind speed the storm has at landfall.\nWhat are the effects of a hurricane?\nHurricanes are widespread and destructive storms that form over warm ocean waters. They can cause significant damage both in the United States, where they are known as hurricanes, and in countries along their path. Hurricanes can cause a wide range of impacts including massive destruction, loss of life, and displacement of people.\nThe best way to protect yourself from a hurricane is to be aware of what to expect and take necessary precautions. Here are some key things you need to know:\n-A hurricane is an intense storm that forms over water.\n-A hurricane is typically accompanied by strong winds, high waves, heavy rains, and sometimes tornadoes.\n-If you live in an area prone to hurricanes, make sure you have an emergency plan in place and follow instructions from local officials.\n-Stay away from floodwaters or areas that may be affected by flooding.\n-If you must evacuate your home, do so as quickly and safely as possible.\n-Stay tuned to local media for updated information on Hurricane Irma\nHow do I prepare for a hurricane?\nHurricane season begins in May and ends November 30th.

While tsunamis were largely unknown to the wider public before the hugely destructive 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami, they have occurred many times in the past.\nTsunamis can be generated by any significant displacement of water in oceans or lakes, though are most commonly created by the movement of tectonic plates under the ocean floor, during an earthquake. But they can also be caused by volcanic eruptions, glacial carving, meteorite impacts or landslides.\nTsunamis: Larger tsunamis don't alway cause the most destruction\nTsunamis have occurred often throughout history. So frequently in Japan, in fact, that they invented the word specifically for the phenomenon: 'tsu' meaning harbour and 'nami' meaning wave.\n\"It's actually quite frightening to think that this [Japanese tsunami] event is smaller than the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, smaller even than the 1960 Chilean tsunami, yet the damage to Japan's people and economy is still profound,\" says Professor James Goff, co-director of the Australian Tsunami Research Centre and Natural Hazards Research Lab at the University of New South Wales. \"It's a horrendous tragedy, caused by a completely unpredictable event.\"\nBecause little historical data exist on the size of tsunami waves, how many occur in one event, or how far they advance on shore, scientists rank them according to how much damage they wreak. However, assessing just how much damage a single tsunami event causes may take many months to years; and it may be some time before the Japan earthquake and tsunami can be truly rated on a historical scale.\n- Tsunami: terror from the sea\n- Tsnuami warning: why prediction is so hard\n- Why tsunamis don't always generate\n- Tsunamis: how they form\n10 WORST TSUNAMIS\n1. Sumatra, Indonesia - 26 December 2004\nThe 9.1 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Sumatra was estimated to occur at a depth of 30 km. The fault zone that caused the tsunami was roughly 1300 km long, vertically displacing the sea floor by several metres along that length. The ensuing tsunami was as tall as 50 m, reaching 5 km inland near Meubolah, Sumatra. This tsunami is also the most widely recorded, with nearly one thousand combined tide gauge and eyewitness measurements from around the world reporting a rise in wave height, including places in the US, the UK and Antarctica. An estimated US$10b of damages is attributed to the disaster, with around 230,000 people reported dead.\n2. North Pacific Coast, Japan - 11 March 2011\nA powerful tsunami travelling 800km per hour with 10m-high waves swept over the east coast of Japan, killing more than 18,000 people. The tsunami was spawned by an 9.0 magnitude earthquake that reached depths of 24.4km- making it the fourth-largest earthquake ever recorded. Approximately 452,000 people were relocated to shelters, and still remain displaced from their destroyed homes. The violent shaking resulted in a nuclear emergency, in which the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant began leaking radioactive steam. The World Bank estimates that it could take Japan up to five years to financially overcome the $235 billion damages.\n3. Lisbon, Portugal - 1 November 1755\nA magnitude 8.5 earthquake caused a series of three huge waves to strike various towns along the west coast of Portugal and southern Spain, up to 30 m high, in some places. The tsunami affected waves as far away as Carlisle Bay, Barbados, where waves were said to rise by 1.5 m. The earthquake and ensuing tsunami killed 60,000 in the Portugal, Morocco and Spain.\n4. Krakatau, Indonesia - 27 August 1883\nThis tsunami event is actually linked to the explosion of the Krakatau caldera volcano. Multiple waves as high as 37 m were propagated by the violent eruptions and demolished the towns of Anjer and Merak. The sea was reported to recede from the shore at Bombay, India and is said to have killed one person in Sri Lanka. This event killed around 40,000 people in total; however, as many as 2,000 deaths can be attributed directly to the volcanic eruptions, rather than the ensuing tsunami.\n5. Enshunada Sea, Japan - 20 September 1498\nAn earthquake, estimated to have been at least magnitude 8.3, caused tsunami waves along the coasts of Kii, Mikawa, Surugu, Izu and Sagami. The waves were powerful enough to breach a spit, which had previously separated Lake Hamana from the sea. There were reports of homes flooding and being swept away throughout the region, with a total of at least 31,000 people killed.\n6. Nankaido, Japan - 28 October 1707\nA magnitude 8.4 earthquake caused sea waves as high as 25 m to hammer into the Pacific coasts of Kyushyu, Shikoku and Honshin. Osaka was also damaged. A total of nearly 30,000 buildings were damaged in the affected regions and about 30,000 people were killed. It was reported that roughly a dozen large waves were counted between 3 pm and 4 pm, some of them extending several kilometres inland at Kochi.\n7. Sanriku, Japan - 15 June 1896\nThis tsunami propagated after an estimated magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred off the coast of Sanriku, Japan. The tsunami was reported at Shirahama to have reached a height of 38.2 m, causing damage to more than 11,000 homes and killing some 22,000 people. Reports have also been found that chronicle a corresponding tsunami hitting the east coast of China, killing around 4000 people and doing extensive damage to local crops.\n8. Northern Chile - 13 August 1868\nThis tsunami event was caused by a series of two significant earthquakes, estimated at a magnitude of 8.5, off the coast of Arica, Peru (now Chile). The ensuing waves affected the entire Pacific Rim, with waves reported to be up to 21 m high, which lasted between two and three days. The Arica tsunami was registered by six tide gauges, as far off as Sydney, Australia. A total of 25,000 deaths and an estimated US$300 million in damages were caused by the tsunami and earthquakes combined along the Peru-Chile coast.\n9. Ryuku Islands, Japan - 24 April 1771\nA magnitude 7.4 earthquake is believed to have caused a tsunami that damaged a large number of islands in the region; however, the most serious damage was restricted to Ishigaki and Miyako Islands. It is commonly cited that the waves that struck Ishigaki Island was 85.4 m high, but it appears this is due to a confusion of the original Japanese measurements, and is more accurately estimated to have been around 11 to 15 m high. The tsunami destroyed a total of 3,137 homes, killing nearly 12,000 people in total.\n10. Ise Bay, Japan - 18 January 1586\nThe earthquake that caused the Ise Bay tsunami is best estimated as being of magnitude 8.2. The waves rose to a height of 6 m, causing damage to a number of towns. The town of Nagahama experienced an outbreak of fire as the earthquake first occurred, destroying half the city. It is reported that the nearby Lake Biwa surged over the town, leaving no trace except for the castle. The Ise Bay tsunamis caused more than 8000 deaths and a large amount damage."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"factuality","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise","category_name":"direct"},{"categorization_name":"phrasing","category_name":"verbose-and-natural"},{"categorization_name":"linguistic_variation","category_name":"similar-to-document"},{"categorization_name":"multi-doc","category_name":"comparison"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"expertise-categorization","category_name":"expert"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6b132c8a-5f1f-4a7b-b7b6-d140406efd82>","<urn:uuid:ccead698-b4ef-4386-a67e-403c888e2af1>"],"error":null}
