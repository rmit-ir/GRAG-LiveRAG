1	ocean percentage earth total water	The oceans contain 97% of the Earth's water, but this is salt water that is not consumable by most land plants and animals. Only 3% of Earth's water is freshwater.	"['Water is a compound of and hydrogen. It is scientifically known as H2O; two hydrogen atoms attached to every oxygen atom. Water is a very important natural resource that is found everywhere on the earth. It fills our lakes, our rivers and our oceans. It exists in our atmosphere. It soaks beneath the soil and collects just below the surface. It is in the food we eat, the plants that grow and the animals that live and breathe in all parts of the earth. Without it there could be no life on Earth. In fact, nearly three quarters of our planet is covered by water.\nProperties of Water\nWater has some amazing properties that make it very unique. Water is the only substance on Earth that can exist naturally in all three ""states"" — a liquid, a solid and a gas. As a solid, it is ice. We all know the liquid form because we drink it, bathe in it, swim in it, and pour it. When water is heated up to just the right temperature it turns into a vapor — like the steam rising off of your cup of hot chocolate. Learn more about states of water here. You might also want to visit Science Trek\'s States of Matter site.\nBesides being the only substance on earth that can perform these feats, water has some other tricks many do not know about. Take a look at these facts:\n- Water boils at 212° F (100° C) and freezes at 32° F (0° C) at sea level. These temperatures decrease, the higher above sea level you go.\n- When water freezes, it freezes from the top down and the ice floats on the surface of liquid water. If it did not, fish would not survive the winter in a river or a lake.\n- Water is one of the few substances that expands when it freezes.\n- Water dissolves more minerals, vitamins and chemicals than any other liquid. For this reason it is called the “universal solvent.”\n- Water has a natural ability to be attracted to itself and so it collects in beads. This causes it to form drops rather than to spread out over a surface.\n- Water has a property called surface tension. Because of surface tension , some insects can actually sit on the top of the water.\n- Pure water has no smell nor taste and cannot conduct electricity. Dissolved minerals in water give it taste, smell and the ability to conduct electricity.\nThe Water Cycle\nThe earth has a limited amount of water. We have the same amount of water on earth today as we did millions of years ago. We keep using the same water over and over again. Water keeps recycling around and around in a closed system called the water cycle. It does this by changing its state.\nWhen the sun heats water in the oceans, the lakes or rivers some of the water turning into water vapor in the air. The water vapor forms into clouds as it cools. This is known as condensation. When the drops of water get big enough in the clouds they become too heavy and fall back to the earth as precipitation, otherwise known as rain, hail, sleet or snow.\nThe water that falls to the ground as precipitation runs off into lakes and rivers and is known as surface water or it can soak into the ground to become groundwater. Over time, the surface water and the groundwater can travel back to the oceans which completes the water cycle and starts the process all over again. Read more about the water cycle here.\nSometimes we take water for granted because it seems like there is a never-ending supply. After all, if you look at a picture of Earth from space it is one big blue ball! What we see is the surface water that exists in lakes, rivers, ponds, streams, glaciers, polar ice caps, snow, mud puddles, and oceans.\nThe oceans contain 97% of the Earth\'s water. But the ocean\'s salt water, as it is called, is not consumable by most land plants and animals. The dissolved salts make it undrinkable and even harmful for plants and animals.\nFreshwater constitutes the remaining 3% of the earth\'s water. Most of this freshwater is frozen in glaciers and icebergs. So the liquid freshwater must provide for the rest of the planet. That isn\'t very much when you consider the number of people, plants and animals that must share this freshwater.\nSurface water is easily polluted or contaminated. Mud, animal waste, parasites, chemicals, garbage, and other foreign matter can make the water unusable. This contamination of surface water contributes to many deaths over the globe where clean water is not available. In areas where communities have the power to clean their water before use, this danger has been avoided. Read more about surface water here. Here\'s more about oceans, and more about freshwater.\nGroundwater is water beneath the earth\'s surface. It filters down between the layers of rock and soil and ends up in underground collection places known as aquifers.\nMost of the water we use in Idaho comes from groundwater. Wells are dug to get groundwater from aquifers. The water is pumped out to be used on farms, in industry, for city water supplies and other uses. Ground water is often safer to use than surface water. The layers of soil and rock that the water must trickle through to get to the aquifer actually cleans and filters pollutants from the water. Read more about groundwater here.\nThe water over a given geographic area tends to drain from the mountains to the lowest point; usually a river or a lake. This includes all streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, and groundwater that drain into the same general area. This geographic area of water drainage is known as a watershed. It can be quite large, but does not necessarily need to. Learn more about watersheds — even find a map of the watershed you live in by your zip code here.\nHow do we use water?\nWater isn\'t just for drinking, it is also used for growing crops, cooking, cleaning and transportation. Water is used for cooling, for running equipment or for moving heavy loads. We also use water to generate power, to fight fires, for sanitation, in manufacturing, in mining and much more.\nWater is used for recreation ‐ for boating, waterskiing, and swimming. In its frozen form, it offers additional recreational opportunities such as ice skating, hockey, skiing, and snowboarding.\nWater Became a Tool\nWater is so important to life on the earth. Humans found ways early in history to manage and use water as a tool.\nOne of the first needs was to get water from one place to another for drinking and for growing crops. Civilizations started near water sources. Carrying water in jugs or containers was the first method of transporting water home. But as the size of civilizations expanded, new ways needed to be developed to get water from one place to another in larger quantities and over greater distances. Over time, canals, aqueducts, tunnels, wells, pumps, and water storage systems were created.\nEarly in history water was used as a tool to drive waterwheels for grinding and sawing. Water was also used as transportation for rafts and canoes. In the logging industry, trees that had been cut floated down rivers to get them to wherever they were needed for building or for other uses. Over time, boats, ships, submarines, and aircraft carriers have been added to the long list of water friendly transportation.\nSince water has long been used for cleaning ‐ water has been a means for getting rid of substances that were waste. Washing clothing, bathing, preparing food, personal hygiene, and toileting were at one time in history all done in the local river. This may sound disgusting to people living in modern 21st century, but even the animals used the river for similar purposes. Drinking water from the local lake, pond or river was done without regard to how truly clean it might be.\nWater treatment programs now exist in most major population areas to treat water that has been used for waste processes before returning it to the drinking water supply. Water treatment protects consumers from parasites, bacterial and chemical contamination. Learn more about the history of drinking water treatment here.\nConservation of water is something that everyone can do. We only have so much water on this earth and so learning to use it wisely is important to us all. If we damage it to the point that there isn\'t any left or what is left is no longer usable ‐ then we are all in trouble. Conservation of water is about learning to use it wisely and carefully. We can start by not wasting water. Don\'t leave the water running when you brush your teeth, take showers instead of baths, fix leaky faucets and keep drinking water in the refrigerator rather than running the faucet to get the water cold. Do your part to help conserve water so there is enough to go around for years to come!\nDams and Hydropower\nDams are another way that water is managed. Dams can collect water for future use and control the flow of water to prevent floods. Dams are constructed in an existing river to slow the flow of the water. This creates a man-made lake known as a reservoir.\nPower can also be created using dams. This method of power generation is known as hydroelectric power or hydropower. Hydropower is energy that is generated from the flow of water using huge power generators placed inside dams. The water flowing through the dams spins giant turbine blades which are connected to generators. The power produced is sent to homes and businesses in the form of electricity. To learn more about Hydropower visit the Foundation for Water and Energy Education here.\nGeysers are an amazing site to see. A plume of water that sprays from the ground ‐ sometimes at regular intervals ‐ is known as a geyser. But what causes a geyser? Groundwater in some parts of the world comes in contact with rocks that have been heated by the forces of volcanic activity. The heated water must reach a boiling temperature in order for a geyser to occur. But if it indeed does reach these extreme temperatures, steam forces the water out of the ground like a pot boiling over. Sometimes there is enough pressure built up to spray the water and steam great distances into the air.\nJust as we can\'t live without water, the opposite can also occur. Too much water at just the wrong time and in just the wrong place can be equally dangerous. Floods, tsunamis, hurricanes, even drinking too much water can be harmful.\n- Floods generally happen when rivers fill up too quickly for their sides to hold. Severe rainstorms or fast spring thaws can cause the water to spill over the sides of a river and flow out onto the surrounding land; sometimes too quickly for anyone to escape. Floods were at one time a way to fertilize the land near the river, but as more and more people build near the river, this become more dangerous to people and their possessions.\n- Tsunamis are ocean waves that move quickly towards shore after an earthquake. The size of a tsunami depends on the strength of the earthquake, the features of the ocean floor and other factors. Tsunamis can flow inland for many miles and wash away buildings, trees, animals, and threaten communities.\n- Hurricanes are enormous storms that form out over the ocean. They swirl in a circular pattern. If they move inland, they can bring great amounts of rain and wind. The wind can blow waves from the ocean into places that are inhabited . The rain and wind can destroy buildings, trees, and endanger other life.\n- We have all been told to drink plenty of water. Our bodies are made of about 60% water. Drinking water helps regulate our temperature, move waste products out, aid digestion, lubricate our joints, and lots of other important jobs. Not drinking enough water can lead to dehydration which can be dangerous. But can you drink too much water? The answer is yes — although it rarely happens. The kidneys process all of the water we drink and move it to our urinary system where we get rid of it. Along with the water, we also get rid of extra minerals, salts, dead germs and bacteria and any other unneeded extras that our body wants to clean out. If we drink too much water, this causes the kidneys to work harder than is necessary. So how much is too much? Drink until you are no longer thirsty — but not sloshy. That rule should make getting enough water easy. Drink extra after exercise and when it is hot. Remember, all your liquids count towards this daily supply, because they all contain water.\nHow Much Do You Know?\nCheck out these challenge questions, quizzes, and surveys from the U.S. Geological Survey to see if you know the answers to intriguing questions about water, such as ""Are raindrops tear-shaped?"", and ""How much water does it take to grow a hamburger?""

2	brimonidine 0.2 solution recommended dose	The recommended dose is one drop of brimonidine 0.2% solution into the affected eye(s) twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., in the morning and at bedtime).	"[""How does this medication work? What will it do for me?\nBrimonidine belongs to the family of medications known as alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonists. It is available in eye-drop form and is used to reduce the pressure inside the eye for people with open-angle glaucoma or intraocular hypertension (increased pressure in the eye).\nFluid is constantly being formed and drained out of the eye. When this fluid does not drain out of the eye properly, pressure inside the eye increases. Brimonidine works by reducing the amount of fluid produced by the eye and by increasing the flow of fluid out of the eye. It starts to work within 2 hours after being instilled in the eye.\nThis medication may be available under multiple brand names and/or in several different forms. Any specific brand name of this medication may not be available in all of the forms or approved for all of the conditions discussed here. As well, some forms of this medication may not be used for all of the conditions discussed here.\nYour doctor may have suggested this medication for conditions other than those listed in these drug information articles. If you have not discussed this with your doctor or are not sure why you are being given this medication, speak to your doctor. Do not stop using this medication without consulting your doctor.\nDo not give this medication to anyone else, even if they have the same symptoms as you do. It can be harmful for people to use this medication if their doctor has not prescribed it.\nWhat form(s) does this medication come in?\nEach 1 mL of clear, greenish-yellow solution contains brimonidine tartrate 2 mg (0.2%). Nonmedicinal ingredients: benzalkonium chloride as preservative, citric acid, hydrochloric acid, polyvinyl alcohol, sodium chloride, sodium citrate, sodium hydroxide, and water for injection.\nEach 1 mL of ophthalmic solution, 0.15% contains brimonidine tartrate 1.5 mg. Nonmedicinal ingredients: Sodium Chlorite 25% w/v Solution Stabilized (as preservative), boric acid, calcium chloride dihydrate, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium borate, sodium chloride, water for injection, and hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH.\nHow should I use this medication?\nThe usual recommended dose for adults is one drop of brimonidine 0.2% solution into the affected eye(s) twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart (e.g., in the morning and at bedtime).\nFor brimonidine 0.15% ophthalmic drops, the recommended dose for adults is one drop of solution into the affected eye(s) 3 times daily, approximately 8 hours apart.\nMany things can affect the dose of medication that a person needs, such as body weight, other medical conditions, and other medications. If your doctor has recommended a dose different from the one listed here, do not change the way that you are using the medication without consulting your doctor.\nSome bottles that contain the eye drops are equipped with a special cap to help you remember how many times to use your drops each day. See the package insert for an illustration of how to properly use these drops.\nTo use the eye drops:\n- Wash your hands before using the eye drops.\n- Remove the cap and place it in a clean location. To avoid possible contamination, keep the tip of the container away from contact with any surface.\n- Tilt the head back and look towards the ceiling.\n- With your index finger, gently pull the lower eyelid down and away from the eye to form a pouch.\n- Apply one drop into the pouch but do not allow the tip of the container to touch the eye or areas around the eye.\n- Gently apply pressure to the inner corner of the eye (at the bridge of the nose) for about 30 seconds (this is called nasolacrimal occlusion). This prevents the medication from dripping down through the tear duct and entering the bloodstream, which could cause you to experience some side effects.\n- Repeat with the other eye, if prescribed by your physician.\n- Wash your hands again to remove any medication.\nDo not allow the dropper tip of the bottle to touch the eye or other surrounding structures. This can contaminate the tip with common bacteria known to cause eye infections. Serious damage to the eye may result if you use eye drop solutions that have become contaminated.\nIf you wear contact lenses, remove them before instilling brimonidine into your eye. You may put your contact lenses back in 15 minutes after using the medication.\nIt is important to use this medication exactly as prescribed by your doctor. If you miss a dose, instill it as soon as possible and continue on with your regular schedule. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue on with your regular dosing schedule. Do not instill a double dose to make up for a missed one. If you are not sure what to do after missing a dose, contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice.\nStore this medication at room temperature and keep it out of the reach of children.\nSome brands require you to discard any remaining medication 28 days after opening the container and begin using a new bottle.
