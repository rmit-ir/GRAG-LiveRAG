1	As someone concerned about environmental impact, I'd like to know why manufacturers are switching to biological alternatives for making everyday products like plastics and cosmetics?	Manufacturers are switching to bio-organic acids due to stringent environmental regulations imposed on conventional organic acid producers. Bio-organic acids are gaining significance because of their renewability and eco-friendly nature, making them an attractive replacement for conventional organic acids in the production of polymers, food, coatings, lubricating oils, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, solvents, and other materials.	['Stringent Regulations over Conventional Organic Acids\nThe market for bio-organics acids is majorly driven by the stringent environmental regulations imposed by regulatory bodies of various countries on conventional organic acid producers. Organic acids can serve as platform chemicals for the production of polymers, food, coatings, lubricating oils, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, solvents, and other materials. Currently, bio-organic acids are gaining significance as a replacement for conventional organic acids, owing to their renewability and eco-friendly nature, which is a key to the increasing market share of bio-organic acid to in the global bio-organic acid market over the forecast period.\nBio-lactic Acid Segment to Dominate the Market Growth\nAmong the product types, bio-lactic acid has the highest growth rate in the global bio-organic acid market. Lactic acid is majorly used to produce Poly Lactic Acid (PLA), which has significant demand from various end-user industries, like packaging, healthcare, and textiles. Bio-lactic acid is also being extensively used to produce the polymer PLA, which is the preferred plastic for 3D printing. The immensely growing PLA market is further helpful to fuel the market growth for bio-lactic acid, which, in turn, drives the demand for bio-organic acid, globally, in the near future.\nAsia-Pacific to Ignite the Market Growth\nThough Europe is the largest regional market for global bio-organic acid, Asia-Pacific is also an important market as it represents the fastest-growing regional market. The increasing demand from healthcare, food & beverage, and textile industries of countries, like China, India, Thailand, and Korea are, in turn, providing great opportunity for the bio-organic acid market to continue its fast pace of growth. Moreover, since the product is an intermediate and is bio-degradable in nature, it has been widely accepted by the industries for various purposes, such as polymer resins. The large market size, with its huge growth in the Asia-Pacific region, is instrumental in the expansion of the global bio-organic acid market.\nKey Developments in the Market\nAugust 2017: The discovery of the Monascus ruber micro-organism proved to be the crucial step in producing organic acids in large-scale industrial fermentation processes.\nAugust 2017: BioAmber bought the bio-based acid plant, which is located in Sarnia in Canada, as part of a joint venture with Mitsui.\nMajor Players: BASF Corporation, Myriant Corporation, BioAmber Inc., Koninklijke DSM N.V., and Braskem, amongst others.\nReasons to Purchase the Report\nIdentify the current and future trends of the global bio-organic acid market in the developed and emerging markets\nAnalyze various perspectives of the market with the help of Porter’s five forces analysis\nInformation of the segment that is expected to dominate the market\nIdentify the region that is expected to witness the fastest growth during the forecast period\nIdentify the latest developments, market shares, and strategies employed by the major market players\n3-month analyst support, along with the Market Estimate sheet (in excel)\nCustomization of the Report\nThis report can be customized to meet your requirements.\n1.1 Research Phases\n1.2 Study Deliverables\n1.3 Scope of the Report\n2.

2	What are the different approaches being developed to target IL-6 in treating myeloma, and what kinds of medications are being tested?	Several approaches are being developed to inhibit IL-6 signaling in myeloma treatment. These include: 1) Antibodies to or antagonists of IL-6R, such as Sant7, MRA (ACTEMBRA 200), ERBA, and NRI/Tocilizumab; 2) Antibodies to IL-6, including mouse monoclonal antibody BE-8 and chimeric antibody CNTO 328; 3) Inhibitors of IL-6 trans-signaling, such as sgp130-Fc; 4) Inhibitors of gp130, including gp130-targeting peptides; and 5) Small-molecule inhibitors, such as Atiprimod. Some of these treatments are currently being tested in clinical trials.	"['Skip to Content\nUnprecedented progress in our understanding of the biologic and\nmolecular genetic underpinnings of human plasma-cell neoplasms (PCN) has\nled to the development of novel targeted therapeutic agents – including\nproteasome blockers (bortezomib), immunomodulatory agents\n(lenalidomide), therapeutic antibodies, and a variety of emerging\nsmall-drug inhibitors of cellular signal transduction pathways – that\nare now beginning to produce tangible benefits for patients with PCN.\nNonetheless, the prognosis and outcome of PCN remain grim, caused in\nlarge measure by serious limitations in our knowledge of the genetic\npathways of malignant plasma-cell (PC) transformation.\nThe research project, entitled, ""Defining genetic pathways of plasma-cell neoplasia,"" seeks to address outstanding questions on the genetics of PCN in order to facilitate ongoing efforts by the clinical research community and the pharmacological industry to treat and prevent these malignancies more effectively. Using two powerful, complementary, unbiased approaches to genetic forward screening in a newly developed mouse model of human PCN, designated iMycΔΕμ, we will first identify candidate driver genes involved in PC tumor progression in mice, and then evaluate these genes across the mouse-human species barrier to identify and validate the involvement of orthologous human driver genes in human PCN. To accomplish this goal, we propose three innovative, closely interrelated, specific research aims.\nAim 1 is to identify PCN driver genes in a virus-based forward genetic\nscreen in mice. The rationale for this aim is based in part on findings\nfrom cancer screens, showing that the Moloney-based murine leukemia\nvirus, MOL4070LTR, accelerates PC tumors in strain C.iMycΔΕμ\nmice – a gene-insertion model of the Myc-activating T(12;15)(Igh-Myc)\ntranslocation. Aim 2 is to identify PCN driver genes in a\ntransposon-based forward genetic screen in mice. The rationale for this\naim develops from evidence that the Sleeping Beauty (SB)\ntransposon-based cancer screen provides a flexible, efficient gene\ndiscovery tool that complements virus-dependent screens; e.g., by its\napplicability to quiescent cells such as PCs. Aim 3 is to validate the\ninvolvement of human orthologs of the putative driver genes identified\nin Aims 1 and 2 in human PCN, and the potential of these genes as new\ntargets for cancer therapy and prevention (Fig. 1).\nFigure 1: Premalignant conditions\nin MM, WM and CLL (panel A) and experimental strategy to elucidate\ngenetic tumor progression pathways in Myc-transgenic mice of great\nrelevance for human MM/WM (panel B).\n(A) MGUS (IgG- or IgA-producing in the vast majority of cases), IgM MGUS and MBL represent the earliest detectable stages in the manifestation of MM, WM and B-CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia), respectively. The three premalignant conditions can be viewed as suspended states in the continuum from premalignant alteration to malignant disease. Alternatively, it has recently been proposed that MGUS should be viewed as a malignant tumor that is kept at bay by an ongoing immune response.\n(B) We use iMyc-transgenic mice, which are prone to malignant B-cell tumors sharing important features with human MM and WM, in two complementary forward-genetic screens to unravel the genetic pathways of tumor progression.\nTransgenic mouse models of human cancer are experimental model systems\nthat rely on laboratory mice that have been genetically manipulated to\nrender them prone to neoplasms that accurately recapitulate important\nfeatures of their human cancer counterparts. Model systems of this\nsort: enable researchers to study the onset and progression of cancer in\nways that cannot be pursued in human beings; advance our understanding\nof the molecular genetic and biological events that contribute to the\ndevelopment and spread of cancer cells; and provide a valuable\npreclinical platform for evaluating new approaches to treat and prevent\ncancer in patients. The latter is particularly important in\ncircumstances in which drug testing requires an intact, immunocompetent\nanimal that is able to produce the same kind of tumor microenvironment\nand recruit the same types of tumor bystander cells commonly found in\nhuman patients. To give but one example, therapeutic antibodies target\ncancer cells by recruiting normal immune cells to the site of attack;\nthus, the preclinical testing of these antibodies requires strains of\nlaboratory mice that have a normal, fully functioning immune system.\nThe development of an immunocompetent, transgenic mouse model of human WM that will be useful for preclinical testing of WM drug candidates\nis the main objective of this research. To that end, we\nare generating a designer model of human WM designated C.IL6/BCL2/AIDnull.\nThis model combines three crucial pathogenetic factors of human WM –\nnamely the B-lymphocyte growth, differentiation and survival factor\nIL-6, the cellular oncoprotein BCL-2, and the inability of WM cells to\nperform immunoglobulin isotype switching (AIDnull) – on the\ngenetic backgroud of BALB/c (abbreviated as C). Strain C mice are\nhighly susceptible to malignant B-lymphocyte transformation (Fig. 2).\nFigure 2: Schematic overview of the pathogenesis of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL)-WM (panel A) and\ntransgenic mouse strains that we propose to use for modeling human\nLPL-WM in mice (panel B)\n(A) IL6 and BCL2 have been\nidentified as ""WM genes"" – genes that confer genetic proclivity to the\ndisease (left). Additionally, IL-6 and BCL-2 are major player in the\nLPL-WM cells (right)\n(B) All strains are on the same genetic\nbackground of BALB/c (C), an important precondition for intercrossing\nthe various transgenes without jeopardizing crucial practical issues of\nthis project, such as the ability to adoptively transfer fully\ntransformed tumor cells or premalignant B-lineage cells from transgenic\nmice. We hypothesize that strain C.IL6/BCL2/AID-/- mice will develop IgM+ WM-like tumors.\nThe ongoing research project, entitled ""Preclinical validation of IL-6 for translational myeloma research,""\nseeks to address outstanding questions on the biology of IL-6 in order\nto facilitate ongoing efforts to target IL-6 more effectively in patients with myeloma (Fig. 3).\nUsing transgenic mouse models of IL-6-dependent plasmacytoma (PCT) as\nthe principal experimental model system, we will: rigorously evaluate\nthe biological significance of IL-6 in Myc-driven PCT development; weigh\nthe relative contributions of autocrine and paracrine sources of IL-6\nto plasma-cell tumor development; and assess the role that an IL-6\nsignaling pathway that has been largely neglected in myeloma research –\ni.e., IL-6 trans-signaling – plays in plasma-cell neoplasia in\nmice. Taking advantage of a set of newly developed transgenic BALB/c\n(C) mouse strains available only at The University of Iowa Carver\nCollege of Medicine, we are pursuing three important, closely\ninterrelated, specific research aims.\nAim 1 is to determine the global significance of IL-6 in Myc-driven PCT\nin mice. The rationale for this aim includes findings that suggest IL-6\nmay be dispensable for plasma-cell tumors (i.e., that pathway activity\ncan be maintained in the absence of an IL-6/IL-6R [IL-6 receptor]\ninteraction). The constitutive activation of Stat3 in Abl/Myc\nretrovirus-induced PCT in mice and activated B-cell like diffuse large\nB-cell lymphoma in humans provides a key example to that end. Aim 2 is\nto evaluate the relative importance of autocrine versus paracrine IL-6\nin Myc-driven PCT in mice. The rationale for this aim includes findings\nsuggesting that autocrine IL-6 is important for carcinomas (such as\nlung and breast cancers), whereas paracrine IL-6 is critical for blood\ncancers (including lymphoma and myeloma). However, the evidence for the\nlatter is largely circumstantial, and the significance of paracrine\nIL-6 for malignant plasma-cell transformation has never been\nunequivocally proven in a genetic study. Aim 3 is to assess the role of\nIL-6 trans-signaling in Myc-driven PCT in mice. The rationale for this\naim includes recent findings implicating IL-6 trans-signaling in\ninflammation-dependent solid and hematopoietic cancers in humans and\nmice and, more specifically, findings indicating that IL-6\ntrans-signaling plays a key role in the development of plasma-cell\nhyperplasia in mice.\nFigure 3: Targeting IL-6 for improved outcome of MM.\nThe scheme depicts novel approaches to inhibit IL-6 signaling in myeloma\ncells (bottom) and/or bone marrow stroma cells (top): IL-6, red\nsquares; IL-6R/gp80, Y-shaped symbol; gp130, blue line). Numbered\nyellow circles indicate active research areas, which can be categorized\n(1) Antibodies to, or antagonists of, IL-6R, including\nSant7 (a modified human IL-6 that binds to gp80 with higher affinity\nthan normal IL-6 does; however, because Sant7 does not recruit gp130 to\nthe IL-6R, it blocks downstream IL-6 signaling), MRA (humanized mouse\nantibody to IL-6R; ACTEMBRA 200 [Chugai Pharmaceuticals]), ERBA (IL6R\nantagonist), and NRI/Tocilizumab.\n(2) Antibodies to IL-6, including mouse monoclonal\nantibody BE-8 and chimeric antibody CNTO 328 (Centocor), which is\ncurrently being tested in a phase-2 clinical trial with and without\n(3) Inhibitors of IL-6 trans-signaling, including\nsgp130-Fc (R&D Systems), which captures circulating IL-6 and thus\nprevents it from binding to membrane-bound IL-6R.\n(4) Inhibitors of gp130, such as gp130-targeting peptides.\n(5) Small-molecule inhibitors, including Atiprimod (Callisto).']"	['<urn:uuid:466a2997-81ca-4a65-b31f-49dbc5455053>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	novice	patient	2025-04-22T14:43:01.839766	21	77	1413
