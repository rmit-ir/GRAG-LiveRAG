217	how many people orange county recycling plant serve	The Orange County water recycling plant produces enough water to serve 800,000 people.	"['The liquid in the trough below looks remarkably like iced tea. But trust me, you don\'t want to drink it.\n""This is the first step of our treatment process,"" says Denis Bilodeau, vice-president of the Orange County Water District, on a metal catwalk next to a canal of municipal sewage.\n- California drought: \'Water cops\' hope to curb water waste\n- Farmers hit with record $1.5M fine for allegedly stealing water\nWater is precious in the drought-plagued region, and this massive water recycling plant in Fountain Valley, an hour south of Los Angeles, was built to convert raw sewage into drinkable H20.\nThe brown liquid begins to bubble. Then it will be drawn into straw-like filters 1/300th the size of a human hair.\n""That will keep all of the bacteria and viruses out,"" Bilodeau says.\nThe sewage will go through reverse osmosis and then be treated with intense UV light from bulbs manufactured by Ontario company Trojan UV.\n"" It\'s actually clean down to the atomic level, where all we have left is the H20 molecules,"" Bilodeau says. ""And now this plant produces enough water to serve 800,000 people.""\nGot any more sewage?\nAccording to the Orange County Water District, the facility is the largest of its kind in the world. Built in 2008, it has already gone through one expansion, and now Bilodeau says they\'re preparing for a second.\n""Our only limiting factor now is that we need more sewage water to process,"" Bilodeau says. ""Here in Orange County we actually have less sewage than we did 20 years ago because of all of the water conservation that takes place with low-flow toilets and low-flow shower heads.""\nUrban Californians are using a third less water than they were two years ago. But letting lawns go brown and fountains go dry isn\'t enough. Many here realize that at home they have to not just use less, but re-use more.\nThat\'s why Laura Allen decided to modified some of her appliances. Half of California\'s urban water is used on landscaping. But the garden at her apartment building gets most of its water from its sinks and washing machines.\nAs she washes her hands, the dirty water is piped from the sink into small underground reservoirs covered with small round covers. Water trickles out of the pipe and into the reservoir through a layer of wood shavings.\n""The greywater flows through, it soaks through the wood chips. And they are actually the filter, so they catch all the lint or debris in the water, and the greywater soaks down into the soil,"" Allen says.\nThe washing machine, too, has been retrofitted with a simple valve.\n""One side of the valve sends the water back to the sewer or the septic, the other side goes into our irrigation system,"" Allen says. ""You have to make sure you\'re using plant-friendly products… if you use that, the water\'s great quality for irrigation.""\nAs founder of the group Greywater Action, she now teaches people how to install their own water recycling systems, which are becoming more popular as Californians become more aware of the drought and receive generous incentives from water utilities.\n""Generally speaking, you can save 16 to 40 per cent of your water consumption,"" Allen says.\nThat\'s about 56,780 litres a year for an average household. Which is helpful, but some cities are starting to think a lot bigger.\nThis week, the the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California presented a plan to develop a water recycling plant in the Los Angeles area that could provide enough water for 300,000 people for a year. It would be even bigger than the mega-plant in Orange County, which generates enough to cover a quarter of the needs of the district\'s more than two million residents.\n""Once we explain to people that the water we create here is actually cleaner than bottled water or what\'s in their tap,"" Bilodeau says, ""then they understand that this water is very safe to drink.""\nExcept no-one will actually drink this water — at least not right away.\nRegardless of how much the water is filtered, health officials here still don\'t allow it to go directly from toilet-to-tap.\n""We\'re very mindful that perhaps the public isn\'t quite ready for that step yet,"" Bilodeau says.\nInstead, it\'ll be piped underground to replenish California\'s dwindling groundwater, which may eventually get drawn back into the municipal water supply.\nBut he\'s certain that soon Californians will have no choice.\n""The future is here,"" Bilodeau says.']"	['<urn:uuid:78034183-2d3f-4cb9-bcc0-a9ec9df69ac2>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-01T22:36:12.692263	8	13	750
43	What role does augmented reality play in teaching abstract STEM concepts, and how are new paper technologies being integrated into educational materials?	AR technology helps students visualize complex and abstract concepts in STEM subjects, particularly beneficial since students often struggle with theoretical postulations. Through haptic devices, students can manipulate and utilize their sensory faculties when constructing knowledge, enabling visualization of large and small phenomena and anatomical figures. Regarding paper technologies, new developments include second generation (2G) paper that uses optical recognition to trigger digital information, and third generation (3G) paper with embedded sensors that can connect to digital content, allowing paper documents to have hotlinks to multimedia content that plays on nearby devices.	"['Continuing on the series….\nHere are few ways in which AR can be applied in a school dynamic.\n- STUDENT ENGAGEMENT\nTechnology has often been cited as a tool to increase student engagement. Bonascio (2017) and Magana, Serrano & Rebello (2019) theorise that AR is able to prolong attention and focus, as when multimodal resources and haptic devices are used, higher levels of enjoyment are experienced. This gratification is significantly reduced in students that do not comprehend the mechanics of the technology and indicated that whilst utilising AR can improve digital literacy, explicit teaching is required to ensure that all students are able to interact successfully with the technology (Magana, Serrano & Rebello, 2019).\n2. INQUIRY LEARNING\nOddone (2019) and Foote (2018) both suggest that greater educational benefits arise from students creating their own interactive images and overlays rather than using supplied ones. Apps such as Metaverse or Augment can be used by students to construct their own interactive content and would be an ideal cross curricular inquiry task across any discipline, but have curriculum value within the Science, History and Geography inquiry skills section. Examples of inquiry tasks include:\n3. ABSTRACT CONCEPTS & STEM SUBJECTS\nMagana, Serrano & Rebello (2018, p.526) believe that there is a positive effect to using multimodal resources and active learning for science and its related fields. This is because students often need assistance with visualising complex and abstract concepts (Saidin, Abd Hali & Yahaya, 2015; Riva, Banos, Botella, Mantovani & Gaggioli, 2016). Abstract concepts can be problematic for many students because of the difficulty students can have in visualising theoretical postulations (Furio, Fleck, Bousquet, Guillet, Canioni & Hachet, 2017, p.2-3 ). This struggle can negatively influence a student’s perception of the content material and lead to adverse learning outcomes (Furio et al., 2017, p.2-3 ). AR technology allows students to visualise the concept, albeit in animation, and increase comprehension which leads to improved outcomes (Saidin, Abd Hali & Yahaya, 2015, Wu et al., 2013). This is because haptic devices allow students to manipulate and utilise their sensory faculties when they are constructing knowledge. Large and small phenomena, as well as anatomical figures, can be visualised using AR technology (Wu et al. 2013).\n4. READING – RECREATIONAL & INFORMATIONAL\nAR books is the largest growing trend in children’s publishing and that many publishers are supplementing traditional texts with AR embedded resources (Levski, 2018; Zak, 2014). This is because AR books are seen as more innovative and able to improve flagging reading rates in children and adolescents (Levski ,2018, Zak, 2014). Many young readers find the interactivity extremely engaging and the use of technology appeals to digital natives (Magana, Serrano & Rebello, 2019).\nMayahayuddin & Mamat, (2019) point out that the multimodal nature of AR improves literacy because the audio visual cues assist students in decoding. Additionally, AR enables students that have low focus or attention to enhance their learning as it grants access to language in both formal and informal contexts, which is very useful for students with ADD, ADHD and those with social anxiety (Rafiq & Hashim, 2018, p.31; Mayayuddin & Mamat, 2019. These benefits are further improved when AR is combined with gaming principles which provides additional interest and intrinsic motivation (Mayahayuddin & Mamat, 2019; Levski 2018).\nFoote, C.

Information Technology and Libraries.', ""Next generation paper: Connecting paper to the web\nThis multidisciplinary project aims to explore the future of paper and its connection to the web. It will do so in the domain of travel and tourism where paper and screen-based information are already used together in the tourist experience.\nThe project proposal was in response to a call on ‘Content creation and consumption in the digital economy’. It aims to create new technology and business opportunities in the publishing and tourism industries. It will do this by using augmented reality and printed electronics to connect paper to the web, in what the team call second generation (2G) and third generation paper (3G).\nIf today’s ordinary paper is considered first generation (1G) paper, then 2G paper will be optically recognised with a camera, triggering associated digital information to be played or displayed on a nearby device.\n3G paper will dispense with the camera and contain tiny sensors printed or embedded in the fibres of the paper itself. This will trigger the same kind of associations around it. In this way, paper documents and books could have hotlinks to webpages, audio, video clips and so on that could play on speakers or screens around them. The team will be looking at how this could change and connect the use of paper and screen-based information in tourism, where tourist brochures and guides already co-exist with mobile apps, digital photography and online booking systems.\nMore information is available in this press release.\nA key feature of the project is that it will be investigating new business models for next generation paper, alongside building and testing the technology itself. This means that we will be working closely with our industrial partners on options for commercialisation and establishing industry standards.\nThe project team\nThis includes five groups at Surrey and one at the Open University.

168	As a literary scholar, I'm curious how death inspires creation in Joyce and Verdi. Care to explain?	Both works show how death catalyzed creative responses, but in different ways. In Joyce's Ulysses, death and infertility are symbolically explored through Stephen's 'Parable of the Plums' where two barren women throw plum seeds from atop Nelson's pillar, representing Dublin's cultural stagnation. In contrast, Verdi directly responded to death by creating his Messa da Requiem - first conceived as a collaborative work after Rossini's death in 1868, then fully realized as his own composition following Manzoni's death in 1873, transforming loss into a powerful musical legacy.	"['by James Joyce\nUlysses Aeolus Analysis Summary\nIn the last few episodes, we\'ve been focusing a great deal on character development. Here, let\'s put our eye on the theme of the chapter. Namely: pumped up rhetoric and the chaos of the media world.\n""Aeolus"" has the first visually jarring stylistic change-up in the book: the insertion of newspaper headlines throughout the chapter. There are a number of different ways to think about what these headlines are doing here. As we keep saying, style is something that is extremely flexible in Ulysses. The way that Joyce writes incorporates the moods and emotions of his characters as well as the current setting. It\'s not too hard to imagine the free-associating Mr. Bloom imagining everything that goes on in the newspaper office in terms of headlines, but that\'s not quite what\'s going on here. The headlines are coming from outside the context of the scene. We\'re being made aware of the narrator of the story, and of the fact that the book is aware of itself as a book. Whoever is telling this story acknowledges that it is being written, and this acknowledgment of the written form allows the narrator to toy with the form as he sees fit.\nThere\'s another way one might think of these headlines. Normally, when we wander down to breakfast to read the paper, we think of headlines as something quite separate form our lives. The newspaper is telling us: ""This is what\'s going on in the world today. Listen up."" We think of the news as something external, something that happens to us, something out there. The waythat the headlines in ""Aeolus"" pick up on little bits of speech between the men in the newspaper office and puts words to minor events emphasizes the fact that the news is pulled from everyday experiences. It is tied into human lives, not disconnected from them. In other words, the news records what\'s going on in the world; it does not dictate it.\nNow, in the Odyssey, Aeolus is the god of the winds. He first agrees to help Odysseus make his way home by harnessing all of the winds and putting them into a bag for Odysseus to keep while he sails home. Yet Odysseus\'s crew, thinking that the bag must be full of treasure, opens it and the winds are released. They are blown all about and eventually end up back at Aeolus\'s island. This time he isn\'t so ready to help Odysseus.\nHere, the winds are compared to the rhetoric of the journalism world: speech just being blown this way and that without really being controlled or carefully crafted. In the back offices of the paper, the men banter and recall great journalists and orators of the past. But speech just floats about in the chapter. Many stories hang open-ended. We often move from one conversation to another without much warning or indication. Each person\'s words are overblown and largely directionless. Bloom is one of the only men there who seems to be focused upon a specific task – renewing Keyes\'s ad – but his attempts are thwarted. Crawford, eager to hurry over to the bar, tells Bloom that Keyes can ""Kiss his Royal Irish Arse.""\nAs the cast of minor characters continues to widen, we also get more of a sense of the overall atmosphere of Dublin. We learn that Myles Crawford is something of a drunk; we see that for all his erudition professor MacHugh isn\'t exactly set on accomplishing much; we are introduced to J.J. O\'Molloy who once was a promising lawyer but now has fallen on hard times and needs a loan. As in Dubliners, we get a sense of Dublin as a stifling place, one that is quick to knock men\'s ambitions flat. And the solution here is often: go to the pub.\nThe chapter also brings our two major characters, Bloom and Stephen Dedalus, into early glancing contact. Stephen Dedalus enters while Bloom is across the street trying to track down Keyes. Then Bloom returns just as Stephen and the rest of the men are headed out to the pub. Bloom observes Dedalus as ""a moving spirit"" and it is clear that he is attentive to him as he notices that he has put on new boots. Stephen, in contrast, doesn\'t even acknowledge Bloom. Stephen\'s in his element; Bloom is not. The newspapermen dote on Stephen. Crawford agrees to publish Deasy\'s letter because it came from Stephen, and offers him a job at the paper. Bloom, by contrast, is constantly slighted by other men in the office and remains aloof, left to observe them as they all go off drinking together.\nWhat\'s the deal with ""The Parable of the Plums?"" Stephen tells a bizarre story about these two old Irish virgins climbing up to the top of Nelson\'s pillar, having a picnic on top and throwing their plum seeds down to Dublin. First, note that Lord Nelson was a British Flag Officer famous for his participation in the Battle of Trafalgar. He later became famously embroiled in an affair with the wife of the British Minister to Naples. In Joyce\'s time, there was much controversy over the pillar in the center of O\'Connell street that had been set up to commemorate Nelson. Part of the controversy was related to the fact that there was a statue honoring a British officer in the center of Dublin when many people in the city wanted nothing more than to be free of their British oppressors. On a simpler level, people thought that it was ugly and that it blocked traffic (this controversy was settled later, in 1966, when some IRA men blew up the pillar; today the Spire of Dublin stands in its place).\nNow, in Stephen\'s parable, these two older women who have never given birth to anyone hike up the top of this British monument and sit admiring Dublin. They eat their plums and then throw down the seeds. On one level, Stephen is comparing Dublin (namely, an independent Dublin) to the Promised Land in the Old Testament. But, in his version, the people looking out on the Promised Land are looking out on it from a British monument. Everything seems barren, infertile, unpromising; the old women eat their plums, but then toss the desiccated seeds down into the street. In short, optimism is not running high in Dublin.', 'Classical music has such a long, storied history, that it can be difficult to know where to start. Each week, we’ll be exploring an important event that left its mark.\nThis week? Gioachino Rossini’s death inspired Verdi to launch an ambitious project involving twelve Italian composers to create a requiem in his honor. The project was eventually aborted, but Verdi’s musical tribute to Rossini survives in the Libera Me of his Messa da Requiem, a grandiose work composed in honor of another idol…\nLike most requiems, Verdi’s Messa da Requiem began with an ending.\n“A great name has disappeared from the world!”\nThe great opera composer Gioachino Rossini died in November 1868, and Giuseppe Verdi—the great opera composer of his own generation—was deeply moved. But, when Verdi wrote the above in a letter, he was also thinking about another Italian artistic titan.\n“When the other one who still lives is no more, what will we have left?”\n“The other one?” He was referring to Alessandro Manzoni, a poet and novelist of about Rossini’s age, best known for The Betrothed. But for now, Verdi’s attention was mainly focused on his dear, departed fellow composer.\nVerdi hit upon an original idea with which to mark Rossini’s life. On the first anniversary of his death, he proposed, a requiem mass would be performed. It would be written jointly by Italy’s leading composers, with Verdi contributing one movement himself—as it transpired, the final movement, Libera me (above).\nAs if that project weren’t unusual enough already, Verdi had some rather specific stipulations. For a start, rather than getting paid, the composers and performers would be expected to contribute financially to the project. After the performance, the score “should be sealed and placed in the archives… from which it should never be taken,” except perhaps for anniversaries. Oh, and Verdi would quit the project immediately if anyone foreign or unartistic became involved.\nCasting an eye over Verdi’s demands, it’s perhaps surprising that the Messa per Rossini project got off the ground at all. But a fairly promising start was not enough to make it happen. The project gave up the ghost fairly slowly, but seems to have been consigned to an unmarked grave by August 1871.\nBy then, however, Verdi had written his own Libera me. “Deliver me, O Lord” says the text… and yet Verdi’s music lingered unperformed.\nThen, on May 22, 1873, Alessandro Manzoni died.\nAnd this time, Verdi decided to write the whole thing himself. He had already written the ending.\nThings went far more smoothly this time. He met his own deadlines, and the first performance did indeed take place on the first anniversary of Manzoni’s death—May 22, 1874—at the church of San Marco in Milan. Unlike the plan for the Rossini requiem, further performances were permitted: three more immediately took place at La Scala. The reaction was positive from almost everyone, with Hans von Bülow one of few exceptions. An “opera in ecclesiastical costume,” he called it. Referring to a sacred work by a leading opera composer, this is surely one of music history’s least imaginative insults.\nThe troubled genesis of Verdi’s Requiem is now a matter for the history books.

326	I'm researching historical art - how did ancient Jewish and Egyptian cherubim compare?	The Egyptian and Jewish cherubim designs showed remarkable similarities. The Egyptians had arks decorated with winged guardian figures that were carried by priests using two poles, just like the Israelite Ark of the Covenant which had two permanent poles and cherubim on top. These similarities can be seen in Egyptian artifacts like Tutankhamun's Shrine. Both cultures used their arks in military contexts - Egyptian reliefs show their ark with cherubim in battle scenes, while biblical accounts describe the Israelite ark being carried into battles against the Midianites, at Jericho, and during the reigns of Kings Saul and David. These parallels reflect how the Israelites, having lived in Egypt, likely adapted and modified certain Egyptian practices while rejecting others. The cherubim in both cases were winged figures meant to guard and protect sacred objects.	['Maimonides taught that the Torah only “allowed” sacrifices because the Israelites saw pagans showing love of their gods by offering them, but the Torah restricted how the offerings should be made (Guide of the Perplexed 3:32). The Cherubim is an example of how the Israelites copied pagan practices.\nOne of the most perplexing ancient Jewish articles is the Ark of the Covenant that tradition states contained both the shattered and whole Decalogue (Ten Commandments). The Ark had two poles that were never removed from the box. No reason is given for this practice. The cover of the Ark contained two winged figures called cherubim. No explanation was offered in the Bible for their presence, leaving us with only speculation. What is most bothersome is that the presence of two winged creatures seems to violate the biblical law prohibiting the building of such figures.\nWhat were the cherubim?\nThe cherubim were two figures placed on top of the ark which was set in the holiest place in the tabernacle and later temples, the “holy of holies.” Some scholars and rabbis say that perhaps the purpose of the cherubim was to screen the ark with their wings so that the ark would not be seen. Others say that the cherubim were guards protecting the ark. A decorative representation of the cherubim was also placed on many parts of the tabernacle and temples. What were the cherubim?\nThe term cherubim is obscure. Some scholars think it is an inversion of letters and is derived fromrekhuv, which means “chariot.” Others suggest that it is from the Akkadian karabu, “to pray” or “to bless” and that the cherubim were beings who interceded and brought the prayers of humans to the gods. We simply do not know.\nScripture does not describe the cherubim. Based on the Babylonian Talmud, Sukkah 5b, Rashi relates a tradition that they had children’s faces, although when cherubim are first mentioned in Genesis 3:24, both Saadiah Gaon and Rashi described them as angels. Rashbam, Rashi’s grandson, suggested that they had the form of birds.\nTwo biblical sources, Exodus and II Chronicles, give different descriptions of the cherubim arrangement. Exodus states that the two figures had “faces [turned] to the other.” Chronicles says instead that they “faced the house,” the temple. The Babylonian Talmud offers a homiletical explanation for the difference: when Israel did the will of God, the cherubim faced each other; but when they did not do God’s will, they faced away from each other.\nThis is a nice sermonic lesson; however, we know that the biblical book of Chronicles has many differences from the Five Books of Moses. It even changed names of biblical characters and spelled names differently. While the authors of the biblical books Judges, Joshua, Samuel, and Kings told about the ancient Israelites and included their faults and failures, the author of Chronicles wrote his book to show the glory of the past and omitted the ancestors’ faults. Thus he was not careful to copy what others wrote before him. It seems clear that even in the far ancient time, centuries before the Common Era, biblical writers did not know what the cherubim looked like or anything about its origin and purpose.\nJosephus, writing in his book Antiquities during the first century CE, admits that we no longer have any idea what the cherubim looked like or what their function was. We know that other ancient cultures had similar if not the same structures. The Babylonians, for example, used winged bulls with human faces set at the entrance to their temples and palaces to protect them.\nDid the ancient Israelites copy the Babylonian idea or an even earlier one? Are these figures a violation of the Decalogue command not to make figures? Many rabbis say that that the commandment only prohibited making idols to worship them and didn’t prohibit making other statutes and paintings.\nThe Egyptians had them before the time of the Torah\nThe ark and covering figures used by the ancient Egyptians was startlingly similar to the Israelite ark and cherubim. Pictures of the ark and its winged guardians can be found in several places in Egypt today, including on Tutankhamen’s Shrine and on top of King Tut’s Tomb. The pictures can be seen on www.thelivingmoon.com/42stargate/03files/Egyptian_Arks.html.\nEgypt was the most powerful nation in the world in biblical times. Its culture was very advanced. Living in Egypt for centuries, the Israelites, which my friend Hessel Meilech called “the world’s chameleons,” probably absorbed and improved many Egyptian ideas while, at the same time, rejecting many of them, such as the Egyptian ceremonies and theology regarding the dead.\nThe Israelites must have seen the Egyptian ark decorated with its cherubim carried by Egyptian priests by means of the two poles that extended from its base.\nScholars have been puzzled for ages why the Israelite ark had two poles that were never removed even when the ark and its cherubim were placed in the “holy of holies,” hidden behind a curtain. Arnold Ehrlich suggested in his book Mikra Ki-Pheschuto that the poles were left in the ark because from time to time the priests or levites would carry the ark to various communities so that the people could see it and perhaps donate toward the maintenance of the temple.\nNow we know that Ehrlich was right. The Egyptian ark not only had cherubim but also poles, and we have pictures of the Egyptian priests carrying their ark from place to place while holding it by its poles.\nAdditionally, it appears that the Israelites used their ark in another way similar to the Egyptians. Reliefs illustrating Rameses military camp at the Battle of Kadesh depict an ark with cherubim in the center of the battlefield (See here: http://www.amazon.com/The-warfare-Biblical-lands-archaeological/dp/B0007DK08C ). Likewise, Moses told the priests to lead the ark into battle against the Midianites (Numbers 31:6). In the Israelite’s conquer of Jericho, the ark went in front of the marchers around the city (Joshua 6:6-8). King Saul had the ark carried into battle (1 Samuel 14:18), as did King David (2 Samuel 11:11).\nThis raises an issue far more bothersome than the question of the violation of the divine prohibition against making images: adopting non-Jewish practices. Actually, this copying of the cherubim is far from unique. Judaism incorporated many non-Jewish practices and theological notions, some of which are bizarre and totally contrary to basic Jewish beliefs.\nWe changed the concept of when the day begins from morning to evening, when the year starts from the spring to the fall, we took the names of the “Hebrew” months from the Babylonians despite at least one being the name of a Babylonian idol, we accepted the Babylonian notion that God judges people during the fall new year (and not before?), and much more. Even many rabbis were and are convinced that St. Augustine’s view that there is an “original sin” which soiled humanity is Jewish. The idea is found in the writings of rabbis in the middle ages and we hear it in sermons today. Augustine (354-430) developed the concept to explain why Jesus had to die: “he died for our sin.” While this notion did not exist before the fourth century and is a basic Christian belief, many Jews bought into it without realizing its origin and without seeing that it is inexplicable: although Augustine said that Jesus died to save humanity by removing “original sin,” people believe they are still stained by it today.\nMaimonides’ Guide of the Perplexed 3:32 explains the ark\nMaimonides’ explained in his Guide of the Perplexed 3:32 that the relatively primitive ancient Hebrews needed to be weaned from old beliefs and customs such as sacrifices. God “allowed” sacrifices to continue in a restricted manner, although God did not want or need them, because the people needed them: they saw that other nations used sacrifices to show their love of their gods. The ark is a good example of his insight.\n Biblical citations for the cherubim, for example, are Genesis 3:24; Exodus 25:18–20, 26:1, 31, 36:8, 35; I Kings6:27–29, 32, 35, 7:29, 36; I Samuel 4:4; II Samuel 6:2, 22:11; II Kings 19:15; Isaiah 37:16; Ezekiel 1ff, 10ff, 28:13ff, 37:7–9, 41:18–20, 25; Psalms 18:11, 80:2, 99:1; I Chronicles 28:18; and II Chronicles 3:13. See also the Babylonian Talmud, Bava Batra 99a and Yoma 54a-b.\n Exodus 25:20 and 37:9.\n II Chronicles 3:13.\n Bava Batra 99a.', 'What Kind of Creatures Are the Cherubim?\nThe centerpiece of a typical temple in the ancient world was a statue of a god. The tabernacle (משכן) is different in that it does not have such a statue. What it does have are two golden statues of cherubim (כרובים) who spread their wings over the kapporet, the lid of the ark of the testimony (Exodus 25:18–20 ≈ 37:7–9). Above the kapporet from between these two cherubim, YHWH meets with Moshe and speaks to him (Exodus 25:22 ≈ Numbers 7:89; cf. Leviticus 16:2).\nThe impression given by Exodus, that cherubim played a central role in the earliest stage of Judaism, is reinforced by references to cherubim elsewhere in the Tanakh:\n- Statues of cherubim, of a somewhat different form, also spread their wings over the ark in the Jerusalem temple (1 Kings 6:23–28 ≈ 2 Chronicles 3:10–13; 1 Kings 8:6, 7 ≈ 2 Chronicles 5:7, 8; 1 Chronicles 28:18).\n- Two-dimensional representations of cherubim decorate surfaces of the tabernacle (Exodus 26:1 = 36:8, 26:31 = 36:35) and the temple (1 Kings 6:29, 32, 35; 7:29, 36; Ezekiel 41:18, 20, 25; 2 Chronicles 3:7, 14).\n- Living cherubim are associated with the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:24; Ezekiel 28:14, 16)\n- They are, apparently, described as being with YHWH as something he rides or sits upon (2 Samuel 22:11 ≈ Psalms 18:11; Ezekiel 9:3; 10:1–22; 11:22).\n- Cherubim constitute a component in an epithet of YHWH which can be translated provisionally as “the cherubim sitter” or “the cherubim dweller”: י(ו)שב הכר(ו)בים / ישב כרובים (1 Samuel 4:4; 2 Samuel 6:2 ≈ 1 Chronicles 13:6; 2 Kings 19:15 ≈ Isaiah 37,16; Psalms 80:2; 99:1).\nWhat, specifically, is a cherub? In other words, what form or forms of creatures does the word כרוב designate?\nThe first recorded attempt to identify the form of the cherub was made by the amora R. Abbahu of Caesarea (ca. 279–320), who employed a midrashic reading of כרוב as כרביא, which can be translated from Aramaic as “like a lad,” to assert that the cherub resembles a child (b. Ḥagigah 13b, Sukkah 5b). However, the cherubim are said to have wings (Exodus 25:20 = 37:9; 1 Kings 6:24, 27 ≈ 2 Chronicles 3:11–13; 1 Kings 8:6–7 = 2 Chronicles 5:7–8), and winged children are not attested in the iconography of the Land of Israel in the biblical period.\nThis identification is likely prompted by the erotes and cupids, the oft-winged boys that personified amorousness in the Greco-Roman art of R. Abbahu’s time. This conclusion can also explain the existence of several peculiar talmudic homilies attributing an erotic aspect to the cherubim of the Jerusalem temple (b. Yoma 54a–b).\nAn anonymous sage in Midrash Hagadol asserted that the cherub resembles a human in all respects except that it has the wings of a bird; the anonymous exegete, unlike R. Abbahu, did not specify an age and presumably had in mind an adult. This view was endorsed in part by Radak (ca. 1160–1235) and Ralbag (1288–1344). The identification of cherubim as winged humans, whether adults or children, found early expression in Jewish and Christian visual art. For example, an illuminated Hebrew manuscript from northern France, dated to 1277–1286, shows the tabernacle ark cherubim as childlike creatures with six wings each, as influenced by Isa 6:2 [Figure 1].\nIt is now known that the winged adult human is a common denizen of ancient Near Eastern iconography, and several modern scholars have identified the cherub with it, including Carl F. Keil and Franz Delitzsch, Robert Pfeiffer, and Louis-Hugues Vincent.\nRashbam (ca. 1085–1158) and Hizkuni (thirteenth century) stated that cherubim are birds. This identification enjoys visual expression in a fifteenth-century drawing by the prolific Jewish illuminator Joel b. Simeon Feibush showing the biblical ark surmounted by two pigeon-like birds [Figure 2]. In the modern era, François Lenormant expressed the same idea regarding the tabernacle ark cherubim, writing that they were probably birds fashioned in the Egyptian artistic style.\nAn intermediate position between this view and the preceding one was taken by Abraham b. Moses Maimonides (1186–1237), who suggested that the ark cherubim in the tabernacle had human heads and faces and avian wings, bodies and feet. He admitted the speculative nature of the suggestion and adduced no arguments in its favor.\nRashbam’s student Joseph Bekhor Shor (second half of the twelfth century), whose name means “firstborn of an ox” – coincidence? – along with Isaac of Vienna (ca. 1180–1250) and other tosafists, proffered the view that typical cherubim are “angels in the image of oxen.” Later scholars, such as the seventeenth-century Protestant polymath Hugo Grotius, promoted similar views. One reason for this suggestion is the fact that the word “שור” in Ezekiel 1:10 is replaced by “כרוב” in Ezekiel 10:14, implying the terms are synonymous.\nBy the end of the eighteenth century, material evidence was adduced to support these views: the human-headed winged bull colossi of Persepolis, which were known from a drawing and description by Dutch traveler Cornelis de Bruyn [Figure 3]. Later, the publicity received by colossal human-headed winged bulls in Assyrian palaces excavated in the mid-nineteenth century [Figure 4], along with the mistaken belief that the Akkadian words kirûbu or kāribu designated these beings, boosted the view that cherubim shared the form of these colossi.\nDoubting the association of the cherub with the human-headed winged bull, the nineteenth-century biblicist August Dillmann preferred to connect the cherub with the griffin, or raptor-headed winged lion. The griffin appears in ancient Levantine iconography; for example, on a thirteenth-century B.C.E. ivory plaque from Megiddo [Figure 5].\nThe prevailing opinion in current scholarship is that the cherub is a winged sphinx, i.e., a human-headed winged lion, such as that depicted on the sarcophagus of the late second-millennium B.C.E. Phoenician king Ahiram [Figure 6]. However, numerous indications found in the descriptions of the sculpted cherubim over the ark (Exodus 25:18–20 = 37:7–9; 1 Kings 6:23–26) reveal that their authors presupposed upright creatures.\nEvidence that the Cherubs Stand Upright\nSheltering with Wings - In the tabernacle, the ark cherubim are described as facing each other and “sheltering the kapporet with their wings” (Exodus 25:20 = 37:9). As noted by Umberto Cassuto and Richard Barnett, if the cherubim stood on four feet, they would shelter the כַּפֹּרֶת with their bodies, not with their wings.\nStanding on the Edge - It can be added that the cherubim are said to be located on either “edge” (קצה) of the kapporet (ibid. 25:18–19 = 37:7–8). If they stood on four legs and their bodies stretched over the length of the kapporet, the word “edge” would be inappropriate.\nAwkward Position for Four-Legged Creature - Moreover, the statement that the cherubim shelter the kapporet with their wings indicates that the wings are extended forward (toward the center of the kapporet), beyond their heads. No depiction of a creature standing on four legs with its wings extended in such an awkward and clumsy position can be found in ancient Near Eastern visual art.\nNo Length Measurement - In the case of the ark cherubim in the temple, the biblical text notes their height and “width” (wingspan), but not their length (1 Kings 6:23–28). As argued by Otto Thenius and many subsequent scholars, this can only be understood if we assume that the cherubim are upright and therefore have no significant length.\nWingspan Equal to Height - An additional indication that the temple ark cherubim are upright creatures is that they are described as possessing a wingspan, 10 cubits (1 Kings 6:24, 25; cf. 2 Chronicles 3:11–13), that equals their height, also 10 cubits (1 Kings 6:23, 26). Franz Landsberger noted that this proportion does not evoke animal forms. Martin Metzger developed the argument in light of his investigation of composite creatures in the ancient Near East. He stated that a composite four-legged creature whose height when standing on its four feet is 10 cubits would have wings of 12–15 cubits each – a length significantly greater the 5 cubits specified in the Bible.\nThe uprightness of the cherub precludes its identification with the winged sphinx, as well as the winged bovine and griffin, which are all non-upright, four-legged creatures.\nA final possibility, first proposed by the tenth-century Jewish grammarian Menahem ibn Saruq, is that כרוב simply means “figure.” Abraham ibn Ezra (ca. 1090–1160s) later elaborated on this idea, stressing that in different contexts the word can refer to different types of creatures. Ibn Saruq and Ibn Ezra follow an older tradition expressed in Targum Neofiti and Saadia b. Joseph Gaon, both of whom rendered the word כרבים in the descriptions of the tabernacle tapestries as “figures.”\nAn entirely different view etymologically, but one which leads to a similar, generalized identification of the cherub, was expressed by the thirteenth-century tosafist Isaac b. Judah Halevi in his work Panah Raza. He explained the root כרב as carrying the meaning “mix.” Thus, he characterized the cherubim of Eden in Genesis as “angels in the form of demons” and argued that their name is a reflection of the fact that they contain a mixture of two species. This identification seems essentially the same as what today would be called a composite or hybrid creature (German: Mischwesen).\nLike the previously cited views, the understanding of כרוב as referring to composite creatures generally, or to a class thereof, has been revived in modern times. Contemporary scholars advocating this position rely on the existence of what they see as contradictory descriptions of cherubim within the Hebrew Bible.\nThis view is challenged by the fact that the biblical writers usually neglect to specify the form of the cherub, even when specifying other details such as materials, position, and dimensions (Exodus 25:18–20 = 37:7–9; 1 Kings 6:23–28 ≈ 2 Chronicles 3:10–13). This omission indicates that there was assumed to be a typical form, with which the reader would be familiar.\nWinged Adult Revisited\nI believe that the the anonymous sage in Midrash Hagadol was correct, and the cherubim are winged humans. Recall that the ark cherubim in the temple are described as having a wingspan that equals their height (1 Kings 6:23–26). Not only four-legged animals, but also upright creatures, whether real ones such as birds or fantastic ones such as winged snakes, would have to have comically short wings in order for their wingspan to be only as great as their height.\nIndeed, we don’t find any depictions of these creatures in the iconographic record that have these proportions. Only humans, who stand erect on long legs and are by far the tallest of any of the candidates in proportion to their other dimensions, can have wings whose span equals their height that still look respectably long. Indeed, humans normally possess an arm-span that precisely equals their height. The Roman architect Vitruvius observed this fact long ago, writing in the context of proportionality in temples (De architectura 3.1.3):\nIf we measure the distance from the feet [of a man] to the top of the head, and we copy the measure to the outstretched arms, we find that the width equals the height, as with surfaces that are perfect squares.\nThis principle was famously illustrated in Leonardo da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man drawing [Figure 7]. When depicting a winged human, it would make sense to portray the wings as having the length of arms.To be sure, winged humans in ancient Levantine iconography often have wings that are extravagantly long, far longer than their arms. But, as noted below, instances are known where the artist portrays the wings as being equivalent to arms and possessing the same length that the arms do (when they exist) or would (when they do not exist).\nIllustrating Wings as Arms\nThree examples will suffice:\nFirst, a stamp seal from Beth Shemesh, which, according to Keel, should probably be dated to ca. 1100–900 B.C.E., depicts an armless, winged human whose wings are spread straight out to his sides [Figure 8], like the ark cherubim in the temple (1 Kings 6:24–27 ≈ 2 Chronicles 3:11–13).\nSecond, a cylinder seal from Tell el-Ajjul, in the vicinity of Gaza, dated by Teissier to the period of ca. 1820–1740, portrays a pair of armless, winged humans spreading their wings out in front of them, like the ark cherubim in the tabernacle, and sheltering a tree [Figure 9].\nThird, a fragmentary Phoenician openwork ivory found in Nimrud, probably from the ninth or eighth century B.C.E., shows a winged human with wings extended in the same position; the upper wing is preserved and is the same length as the adjacent arm [Figure 10].\nConclusion – Winged Humans on the Ark\nThus, the author of the passage in Kings describing the temple ark cherubim could only have had winged humans in mind. If so, we should regard it as probable that other biblical authors writing about cherubim did, too.\nTheTorah.com is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.\nWe rely on the support of readers like you.

215	martin gerlach photographer and sigmund freud work timeline comparison vienna	Martin Gerlach relocated his photography publishing house to Vienna in 1872, while Sigmund Freud began offering therapy to patients in Vienna in 1886, showing they both worked in Vienna during overlapping time periods in the late 19th century.	"['Festoon made from vegetables and beets, from Festons und Decorative Gruppen aus Pflanzen und Theiren, or, Festoons and decorative groups of Plants and Animals, published in Vienna in 1893 by Martin Gerlach. Images courtesy of the Museum für Kunst und Gerwerbe, Hamburg\nThese festoons with their sumptuous cascades of ripe fruits and fragrant roses suspended from a striped silk ribbon resemble at first glance sections of stone ornament, or plaster moulding. But closer inspection reveals the roses to be cabbages, the delicious looking fruits are in fact beetroots and onions, the elaborate silk bow is a curtain cord, and a wooden finial has been pressed into service as a classical-looking prop, hiding the ends of plant stems at the top of the arrangement.\nAll the festoons, swags, garlands and other embellishments in Festons und Decorative Gruppen aus Pflanzen und Theiren, or, Festoons and decorative groups of Plants and Animals, are constructed using similarly inventive combinations of flowers, vegetables, taxidermy and domestic objects. Published in Vienna in 1893 by Martin Gerlach, this book of elaborate photographic collages was intended both as reference and inspiration for artists working across a range of crafts using pattern, from wood carving, plaster work, textiles, illustration and wallpaper design.\nJudging by the seasonality of the plant materials Gerlach used, the photographs were taken over the course of many months. Early spring blossoms of apple and cherry with nesting birds give way to the lilac, roses and hollyhocks of summer, while autumn provides a profusion of gourds, sweetcorn, grapes, apples and pumpkins. Winter is represented by arrangements of pine cones and stuffed squirrels placed amongst evergreen conifer branches.\nSome of the most effective designs use only leaves – the winding stems of creeping cinquefoil form a delicate narrow border, while larger sprigs of oak leaves and acorns could be imagined as infill sections for fabric or wallpaper. Peony flowers and leaves carefully spaced over a diamond grid background would have been helpful for an artist designing a repeat pattern.\nGarlands of citrus fruits are shown in half-sections, the smaller fruits at the edges, gradually increasing in size towards the middle. Some of the most elaborate festoons include tools and musical instruments – in one example a gardener’s spade intersects with a watering can, while a straw basket (or maybe an upturned straw hat?) overflows with produce, celebrating the bounty of harvest.\nFrom the middle of the 19th century photographers such as Adolphe Braun (1812 – 1877) and Charles Aubry (1811 – 1877) saw a commercial opportunity to produce still life studies of flowers as reference material for artists. Although photographs could not entirely replace living specimens, it must have been an immense advantage to be able to see forms of flowers, their leaves and the growing patterns of stems and branches throughout the year, especially in winter, when it was not possible to observe these from life. Gerlach produced a number of reference books in this genre, including plant forms, trees, examples of wrought iron and other architectural details.\nMartin Gerlach (1846 – 1918) was born in Hanau, Germany and trained as an engraver. He established a jewellery business in the 1860s but this enterprise was unsuccessful. Having become interested in photography, Gerlach started a publishing house in the 1870s in Berlin which produced his reference books and a crafts magazine, Die Perle. He re-located his company to Vienna in 1872 and continued his work there, eventually publishing more than forty books about design and a series of books for children including songs, poems and fairytales.\nBy the end of the 19th century decorative motifs like those celebrated in Festons und Decorative Gruppen, and popular in Europe since Roman times, were soon to be swept away by new ideas and fashions associated with Modernism. Today Gerlach’s plant and vegetable festoons and garlands have almost a contemporary feel to them – it’s not hard to imagine a photographer inspired, perhaps, by carvings or plaster work in a historic house, deciding to re-create them with real materials as a post-modern photographic project. More than one hundred years after publication, this collection of images continues both to inspire and document the complex role of photography in design.\nLinks to source materials below:\nFestoons and decorative groups of plants and animals by Martin Gerlach, Vienna.

46	Why do birds fly high up in the evening?	Common swifts are known to ascend to high altitudes during evening twilight in their breeding season in the northern hemisphere. Scientists have proposed several possible explanations: they might be searching for food (as they feed on aerial insects), or they could be using this time for orientation, since twilight allows them to simultaneously detect landscape features, light polarization patterns, stars and magnetic cues.	"[""The functional significance of many animal behavioural patterns still eludes us. This is true even for the behaviour of the common swift (Fig. 2). It has long been known that during their breeding season in the northern hemisphere, swifts ascend to high altitude in the evening twilight. The common swift spends nearly its entire life on the wing. Foraging, mating and even nocturnal roosting are performed in flight, the latter possibly involving an ability to sleep with only one of the brain hemispheres while the other remains alert. Only breeding birds usually spend the night on the nest. So, up to now, hypotheses about the functional significance of the swifts' twilight ascents have all been related to their nocturnal flight behaviour.\nUntil recently, scientists entertained the hypothesis that during dusk ascent swifts select optimal flight altitudes for roosting. However, earlier work established that swifts do not select altitudes with slow or moderate winds that would minimize energy expenditure during roosting. This is all the more surprising because, so far, swifts are the only species for which scientists have demonstrated an ability to compensate for nocturnal wind drift during migration. The apparent paradox between the ability of swifts to compensate for strong wind drift during migration and their low selectivity for wind drift during roosting only demonstrates that the functional significance of twilight ascent is still not well understood.\nAn alternative possibility that has been mentioned is that the swifts' flights to high altitude at dusk represent foraging decisions because their feeding is entirely dependent on aerial fauna such as insect swarms. Weather at the breeding site is not always favourable for feeding and swifts are faced continuously with movement decisions depending on proper assessment of weather conditions. Another possibility is orientation. Twilight is a key period for combining information from different navigational systems because it allows simultaneous detection of landscape features, light polarization patterns, stars and magnetic cues.\nIn the present issue (pp. ?–?), Adriaan Dokter (University of Amsterdam and Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, The Netherlands), Susanne Åkesson (University of Lund, Sweden), Hans Beekhuis (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute), Willem Bouten (University of Amsterdam), Luit Buurma (Military Aviation Authority, The Netherlands), Hans van Gasteren (Royal Netherlands Air Force, The Netherlands) and Iwan Holleman (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands) use a C-band Doppler weather radar, probably the first usage of an operational weather radar for this purpose, to test hypotheses about the functional significance of the swifts' twilight ascent. The authors employed the weather radar in two modes. The conventional scanning was used to derive altitude profiles of bird density. Altitude profiles were also generated for so called ‘clear air’, which includes insects and aerial plankton. The second, fixed-beam mode was used to record individual wing beat signatures, which allow species identification. The relatively low wing beat frequency in combination with a characteristic pattern of alternating flapping and gliding phases of varying length identifies the birds uniquely as swifts.\nClick here to view the full editorial by Michelle Pellissier Scott (Executive Editor)\nFigure 2.

341	pilots landing gear canyon facts dangers	Early pilots faced numerous challenges related to both landing gear and flying conditions in the Grand Canyon. Initial fixed landing gear designs created significant drag and reduced aircraft performance, with landing gear contributing up to 40% of fuselage drag. In the Grand Canyon specifically, there were widespread beliefs about dangerous conditions, including 'tempestuous air currents' and risks of crashing into canyon pillars. However, Lieutenant Alexander Pearson proved these fears unfounded in 1921 when he successfully surveyed the Canyon, though he did discover that airfields needed to be at least two miles from the rim due to turbulence. He even managed to land at Indian Garden below the Bright Angel Trail, with the main challenge being motor overheating due to hot air at the canyon bottom.	"['The year 1921 stands unique in the history of United States aeronautics. World War I had just ended, and a stimulus of popular curiosity emerged regarding the aircraft that essentially won the war.\nAmerica was uncertain of what would happen with aviation after the war and some believed it would be similar to the emergence of the steamboat and railroad which were at first ridiculed, then doubted and then enthusiastically embraced. Today it would be similar to the introduction of the smartphone.\nIn the years after war, countries worked to push the boundaries of what aircraft could do. In the United States, Americans broke the altitude record by reaching 33,114 feet. Air Service planes flew from New York to Nome, Alaska and back. Americans set new speed records in the Pulitzer race on Thanksgiving Day, and Grand Canyon National Park was surveyed by aircraft for the first time.\nBetween the Army Air Service, Naval Aviation, Aerial Mail and civilian aircraft, Americans logged over 15,250,000 miles in 1920.\nAviator Alexander Pearson\nLieutenant Alexander Pearson became a pilot in the United States Air Service in 1917. During the war, he was a flight instructor for various air fields for the military. After the war, as most squadron members left the Air Service and returned to civilian life, Pearson stayed with the Air Service and became a highly accomplished aviator.\nThe 1920s was the introduction of barnstorming, during which pilots went from town to town demonstrating their piloting skills. Air Service pilots and mechanics were encouraged to engage in barnstorming and air races to help aircraft manufacturers recognize the flaws in their own designs and learn from each other.\nIn October 1918, Pearson entered the first transcontinental air race that took off from Roosevelt Field in Long Island, New York and ended at Crissy Field in San Francisco.\nThe race had 100 entrants — 50 began in New York and 50 began in San Francisco. The race only included Army pilots, recommended by their commanding officers, who all flew de Havilland DH-4 aircraft.\nUsing a Rand McNally Railroad map as a guide, Pearson recorded the fastest actual time, and in turn a world record. He crossed the continent twice in 40 hours. He won a Thermos bottle, a leather flying suit and $825 of liberty bonds.\nPearson was stationed with the 12th Observation Flying Squadron in Douglas, Arizona. There he was utilized by the U.S. Army Border Air Patrol to fly along border between the United States and Mexico to watch for bandits and cattle rustlers.\nIn 1920, Pearson became famous when he was involved in an aviation incident along the U.S. — Mexico border. Pearson had been traveling to Florida for a transcontinental flight from Jacksonville to San Diego, California. His de Havilland DH-4 began having engine trouble and he was forced to land in the shrub and rocks near the Rio Grande River.\nBeing resourceful, Pearson gathered the engine water, once it had cooled, and began traversing the rocky terrain of south Texas.\nA large search ensued, with 65 planes searching the ground for the aviator, and most people feared Pearson had perished in a crash. However, Pearson emerged several days later and reported that beaver trappers with burros helped him ride out of a canyon to a ranch where he eventually made his way to Sanderson, Texas.\nSearchers eventually found his plane, repaired it, constructed a runway and returned the plane to San Antonio, Texas.\nGrand Canyon and Williams\nIn May 1921, Pearson was commissioned to survey the Grand Canyon for possible commercial air travel and mail service. He was to locate landing fields and make observations about air conditions for mail and passenger services between the Union Pacific Railroad in Utah and the Santa Fe Railroad in Arizona.\nAccording to the June 10, 1921 edition of The Williams News, Pearson surveyed northern Arizona for a suitable location to be a base for his surveys. After looking at several airfields in the area, he chose the Williams field as the best field for his purposes.\nAccording to The News, “Arrangements were made for landing at the east side of the field (the old Fair ground). The straightaway was lengthened by taking down the fence at the south of Ed Hoffmeyer’s ranch.”\nBrush had to be cleared away from the east side of the oval race track. Gas and oil were available to Pearson and this field remained the official landing site for Williams until Webber Field was built in 1925.\nThe News reported, “This field, so Mr. Pearson states, offers the best opportunity for landing and taking off, of all the prospective fields in northern Arizona, that he has viewed.”\nAccording to Arizona aviation historian Ruth Reinhold, Flagstaff landing strips at that time were in poorer condition than the Williams fairground track. They were small, surrounded by trees and usually muddy. The poor field conditions, the high altitude and unpredictable weather kept pilots from wanting to land in Flagstaff.\nThe Williams News said airmen had formerly flown near the rim of the Grand Canyon, but Pearson’s attempt to fly across and descend into the Canyon would be a first.\nPearson was inundated with tales of how dangerous flying over the Canyon could be. He was told of the hazardous storms and air currents and was “Almost scared to death of the job that has been assigned to him.”\nOn June 4, Pearson arrived at the Grand Canyon and met with the park’s superintendent. They evaluated possible landing sites near the rim, but the dense forest pushed the best site back 11 miles from the rim. He did find a possible emergency landing strip near the Anita Mine, along the railway.\nPearson returned to Nogales, but headed back north June 9 and landed in Williams and spent several weeks flying around the Canyon and northern Arizona. Williams became his base for his Grand Canyon surveys as he inspected Cataract Canyon and as far west as Seligman. He also circled over Flagstaff, the San Francisco Peaks and north over the Grand Canyon.\nPearson reported that flying over the Grand Canyon was better than he imagined. He reported good conditions and is believed to be the first person to cross the canyon, land on the North Rim and return.\nAccording to Reinhold, Pearson even landed at a small airstrip cleared for him at Indian Garden below the Bright Angel Trail in the Canyon.\nDuring his flights, he descended 3,500 feet below the South Rim and 4,500 feet below the North Rim. He said the only difficulty he found was the motor became very hot because of the hot air at the bottom of the Canyon.\nUntil his historic flights, people assumed flying over the Canyon was too dangerous because of the “tempestuous air currents tumbling into and out of the canyon.” People also believed there was a “danger of being dashed against the upstanding pillars and peak of the canyon,” and “It was impossible to take off from a landing of 9,000 feet above sea level.” He proved all of this was possible in his survey flights.\nIn total, Pearson made 14 flights with a total of 22 hours of flying. He reported many findings, including his recommendation that air fields be at least two miles from the rim because of turbulence from the Canyon’s air currents. He suggested using the air strip at the Anita Mine and using vehicles to haul passengers to the park.\nLife after the surveys\nAfter finishing his surveys, Pearson returned to Douglas, where he married Margaret Shannon and honeymooned at the Grand Canyon.\nIn 1922, Pearson completed another transcontinental trip from Fort Bliss to Portland, Oregon, which he completed in 29 hours.\nPearson was involved in several mishaps and crashes during his aviation career like many pilots during this time in aviation history. He was forced to land on a highway north of Roswell, New Mexico with carburetor trouble in 1922. He had another crash near Ft. Bliss with a propeller malfunction. That same year, he also was forced down in a windstorm west of El Paso.\nPearson went on to participate in stunt fairs and air shows, and attended numerous celebrations to display his aircraft. He broke several speed records and became famed as a stunt flyer.\nOn Sept. 2, 1924, Pearson was making test flights for the Pulitzer Race at Wilbur Wright Field when he died in an airplane crash. He was flying a Curtiss R-8 Navy racing plane at 200 mph when a strut failed and the plane’s wings collapsed.\nAn airfield in Vancouver, Washington was designated Pearson Field in May 1925. The dedication included an air show with over 52 planes and 20,000 people in attendance. The field is currently a municipal airport for the city of Vancouver and is one of the oldest operating airfields in the United States. A museum is dedicated to Pearson at Fort Vancouver National Historic Site.\nMore like this story\n- Williams aviation history Part II: Where was the Spirit of St. Louis?\n- Williams aviation history Part I: Charles Lindbergh makes pit stop in Williams\n- Air show features slice<br>of U.S. aviation history\n- Editorial: Celebrate Museum Month by visiting Planes of Fame\n- Warbirds from the past<br>put on big show in Valle', 'This is an example of a tricycle landing gear that is found in newer aircraft models. This type of landing gear makes the aircraft easy to steer because the nose gear is steerable.\nConventional fixed landing gear consists of two wheels forward of the aircraft\'s center of gravity and a small tail wheel located in the rear. This configuration is nicknamed the ""taildragger. ""\nThe Lockheed Y1C-25 had the same type of ""trouser"" landing gear as the Sirius.\nThe Northrop Gamma shown here, as well as the Alpha and Beta, all produced in the 1930s, had landing gear with streamlined coverings that extended down from the fuselage with the wheels sticking out from the bottom.\nRetractable Landing Gear\nAircraft designers of the 1920s knew that reducing drag on an airplane in flight was important to improving speed and fuel efficiency, as well as maneuverability and controllability. But they still had relatively little understanding of what actually caused drag on airplanes. Various structures obviously caused drag, but they had first to identify the most important sources before they could address them.\nIn 1927, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) opened its new Propeller Research Tunnel (PRT) at Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory in Virginia. The PRT was a very large wind tunnel for the time, with a diameter of 20 feet (6.1 meters). It was designed to allow the testing of an entire airplane fuselage with engine and propeller, as opposed to simply a part of an airplane or a scale model. NACA aeronautical engineers suspected that the aircraft landing gear contributed to much of the drag of an airplane, and the PRT was the first wind tunnel that would allow them to test this.\nLanding gear consists of the wheels that stick out below the fuselage so that an airplane can roll down the runway during landing and takeoff. In early aircraft, they were fixed in an open position so that they protruded at all times, even while the plane was flying and nowhere near the ground. Tests in the PRT immediately demonstrated that landing gear contributed up to 40 percent of fuselage drag, which shocked the researchers. They realized that reducing the drag produced by the landing gear would significantly improve the performance of the airplane in flight.\nThere were several ways to reduce the drag of the landing gear. The two most obvious methods were to either retract the landing gear inside the aircraft or redesign a fixed landing gear so that it produced less drag while still protruding below an aircraft.\nRetracting landing gear were not a completely new idea in the 1920s. J.W. Wartin\'s Kitten, built in 1917, had retractable gear (but could not actually fly). The Dayton Wright RB-1 of 1920 and the Verville Sperry R-3 of 1922 also had retractable gear. But these aircraft were rarities and most airplanes had fixed landing gear at the end of metal struts because they were easy to design, strong, and relatively lightweight.\nWhen designing an aircraft, engineers have always had to address five conflicting requirements. These are: performance, weight, cost, reliability, and maintenance. The best solution to the performance requirement was to pull the landing gear completely inside the fuselage and cover them over, presenting a smooth surface that produced no drag. But while ideal from a performance standpoint, this approach affected all of the other requirements—it weighed more, cost more, was less reliable, and required more maintenance. The wind tunnel data from the PRT caused aircraft designers to look immediately for ways of developing landing gear that provided better performance and hopefully did not have too many other costs associated with them.\nThe Boeing Monomail, which first appeared in 1930, and the Lockheed Orion are generally considered pioneers in the development of retractable landing gear, proving that it was practical. But airplane designer Jack Northrop, who was very interested in streamlining aircraft to improve performance, produced the Northrop Alpha, Beta, and Gamma with fixed landing gear during the 1930s. These aircraft had streamlined coverings that extended down from the fuselage, with the wheels sticking out at the bottom. These were generally referred to as ""trouser"" gear. The Lockheed Sirius, which was built for Charles Lindbergh, had streamlined coverings over the wheels themselves that were referred to as ""pants""-type landing gear. Although trouser and pants gear produced more drag than fully retracted gear, they were still a substantial improvement over uncovered landing gear. More importantly, they were still lighter, cheaper, more reliable, and easier to maintain than the retractable gear. But during the 1930s, numerous designers embraced retractable gear—they were willing to accept the other drawbacks of retractable landing gear simply to achieve the better performance.\nAirplane designers explored numerous ways to retract aircraft landing gear into the fuselage. In some aircraft they were pulled straight up, usually into cowlings behind the engines (as in the DC-1, 2 and 3), sometimes with part of the wheels protruding outside the airplane. In other cases, particularly with smaller aircraft, the struts folded inward so that the wheels fit into the bottom of the fuselage horizontally, sometimes covered with a door to further reduce drag. Some of the drive mechanisms were electric, whereas others were hydraulic. The designers had to ensure that the gear deployed and locked in place. Landing gear that collapsed when a plane landed could cause the plane to tumble out of control and kill the pilot, or at least seriously damage the airplane.\nFor early retractable landing gear not even the performance improvements were clearly achievable, since a retractable landing gear with its motors and associated machinery weighed more than a fixed gear, thereby requiring greater lift from the aircraft and negating some of the benefits of the reduced drag of the retracted gear. While retracting the gear could improve the performance of the plane, it might require a bigger engine and more fuel—not to mention more money.\nIn fact, it was this delicate tug-of-war between the extra weight of the gear and the reduced drag that was most important for the overall acceptance of retractable landing gear. Drag increases with speed and therefore reducing drag becomes more important as an aircraft\'s speed increases. As aircraft speeds continued to increase during the 1930s, particularly as aircraft began to reach speeds of 200 miles per hour (322 kilometers per hour), the increased weight of retractable gear became less important than reducing drag, and retractable landing gear became commonplace to most aircraft.\nToday, many low-speed private aircraft still have fixed landing gear because of cost and maintenance concerns. Some even have the streamlined ""pants"" coverings over their wheels. But virtually all larger and faster aircraft have completely retractable landing gear. Designing such gear presents engineers with a number of problems, particularly how to mount them on the airplane without affecting other parts of the aircraft design. Large commercial airliners like the 747 and Airbus A340 have enough internal volume so that the landing gear can fit inside the fuselage diameter. But some smaller commercial aircraft have to compromise. Their fuselages are so small that fitting the landing gear inside the primary fuselage would result in a large bump inside the cabin that passengers would have to walk over. So their landing gear are often fitted inside bulges that stick outside of the fuselage. This is also common to large military transport aircraft like the C-5 and C-17, which use up every inch of interior space and need long flat floors inside so that tanks and other equipment can be rolled inside.\n--Dwayne A.

60	What hardware components are essential to assemble a CNC machine?	A CNC machine typically requires both electrical and mechanical parts. The essential electrical components include a processor/control board (or PC), stepper shield, stepper drivers, and power supply. For mechanical parts, you need cutting tools, a frame, guides and supports, as well as basic hardware like spacers, washers, nuts, screws, and bolts.	['CNC machines have been around for decades, with their history stretching back to the 1950s. In that time, they’ve transformed the way we manufacture things. They’ve also helped to democratize the process, providing a way for budding engineers and makers around the world to create their own products. With such versatility on offer, you—yes, you!—might be wondering how to build your own CNC machine.\nIf this sounds like you, never fear—the team at Scan2CAD is here to help. We’re here to provide handy tips on building a CNC machine. We’ll include some great options for CNC kits, as well as details and resources covering how to build your own CNC machine from scratch. Let’s get started!\nWhat to look out for\nSo, you’re about to build your own CNC machine. But where do you start?\nBefore comparing kits or choosing components, it’s important to start answering some fundamental questions.\nWhat are you going to make with your CNC machine?\nOf course, CNC machines are versatile, and allow you to create a wide range of different products. However, different types of CNC machine are better for different projects.\nStart by considering the types of projects you’re likely to take on, and use this as a basis for the type of CNC machine you choose. This decision will also inform the components you need to produce your machine.\nHow much time do you have to build the machine?\nThe answer to this question will derive in part from whether you are interested in CNC as a hobby or as a potential business. After all, it’s worth spending longer on your machine if there are possible financial rewards at the end.\nHowever, this isn’t the only factor you should take into consideration. CNC Cookbook recommends that, if this is your first build, that you start with a simpler machine. This way, you’ll be more likely to get it done, rather than biting off more than you can chew and giving up.\nHow much are you looking to spend on your CNC machine?\nMuch as with the above question, your answer here will partly arise from whether you intend to use the machine for professional or personal use.\nIn both scenarios, however, it’s always worth trying to get the most for your money. As such, you should evaluate which parts and components are necessary for the machine you want to build. If you don’t need them, don’t buy them! Set yourself a budget you know you can afford, and stick to it.\nWhat skill sets do you have?\nIt’s easier to build your own CNC machine if you already have some of the necessary skills. As such, aim to complete a project that plays to your experience.\nIf you’re already experienced in woodworking or metalworking, then you may wish to try out a more challenging project. A newcomer, meanwhile, may wish to start out with something simpler.\nA CNC kit is an incredibly convenient way to build your own CNC machine. That’s because a kit generally comes complete with everything you need to put your machine together and get started with making things.\nMost kit manufacturers will also offer a number of customization options. This allows you to choose the right components to suit your needs. You can opt for the most basic package if you’re on a tight budget—or splurge if you have more specific requirements.\nThankfully, here at Scan2CAD, we’ve already put together a list of some great CNC kits for beginners. Featured on the list are:\n- MillRight CNC — though basic, this comes in as one of the cheapest CNC kits on the market. A great option if you’re looking to build your own CNC machine for the first time.\n- Shapeoko — this machine arrives partially assembled, making it one of the easiest projects to complete. If you’re feeling more ambitious, Shapeoko is also hackable, giving you real freedom to modify the machine.\n- Maslow — affordable CNC—bigger. Maslow offers users a massive 4’x8′ workspace, letting you create large projects easily.\n- Next 3D — don’t want to get your hands dirty? The Next 3D offers users the chance to build a CNC machine without soldering, drilling or gluing. Simply screw together and get going in no time.\nLooking for more detail? Check out our full list of the best CNC kits for beginners.\nBuild your own CNC machine from scratch\nUsing a CNC kit is one of the easiest ways to get up and running, but it’s not for everyone. If you’d rather have the freedom to build your CNC machine your way, then building from scratch can be a great option.\nWhat you’ll need\nAs you may have already guessed, there are a vast array of possibilities when it comes to building a CNC machine. However, your CNC machine will likely include most, if not all, of the following parts:\n- Electrical parts, including:\n- Processor/control board (some machines may use a PC)\n- Stepper shield\n- Stepper drivers\n- Power supply\n- Mechanical parts, including:\n- Tools, such as cutting tools\n- A frame\n- Guides and supports\n- Spacers, washers, nuts, screws, and bolts\nOf course, figuring out which type of CNC machine to build will help to clarify which parts you’ll need. If you’re struggling to come to a decision, check out our comparison of CNC machines to find out which one’s right for you.\nThe exact assembly of your CNC machine will depend on the type of machine you choose to build, the custom options you choose, what you plan on making with the machine, and many other factors. Nevertheless, the key steps to build your own CNC machine will generally be as follows:\n1. Design your machine\nCreating a design for your CNC machine will help give you a clear idea on the finished project. You may choose to start out with a sketch, before converting the paper drawing to CAD using programs such as Scan2CAD. From there, you can extrude your 2D drawing into a 3D CAD model in programs such as SolidWorks (or one of our top affordable SolidWorks alternatives).\n2. Get the parts\nOnce you’ve designed your machine, you can then proceed to buying the parts for it. Use the list above as a guideline, but feel free to customize the machine to meet your requirements!\n3. Construct the frame\nYour frame is what holds together all the other parts of your machine. As such, it’s the first construction you’ll perform when you build your own CNC machine. Metals such as aluminum are good choices for your frame, as they will ensure stability and rigidity. This will, in turn, help increase the lifespan of your other hardware.\n4. Add the gantry\nNot all CNC machines will feature a gantry, but as one of the most popular design options, we’ve featured it here. A gantry allows your machining tool to move along the Y-axis; it will hold your tool in place above the workspace. Ensure to balance forces acting on your gantry to reduce the potential of machine deformation or shaking.\n5. Bring in the Z-axis…\nYour tool itself will be moving up and down along the Z-axis. You will, however, need a place to house your tool. You’ll mount this housing to the gantry, giving your tool a greater range of depth.\n6. …then the X-axis\nAdding bearings and guide rails will help to maintain the rigidity of your CNC machine, and will enable your tool to move forwards and backwards along the X-axis.\n7. Drive it!\nNow that you’ve added the parts that will allow your CNC to move forwards and backwards, it’s time to add those that will actually make it move on this axis. This is the drive system, typically made up of motors, pulleys, spindles, screws, bolts and nuts, amongst other parts.\n8. Introduce the electronic parts\nYou’re now ready to add the many electronic parts that will make up the heart of your CNC machine. Key to this is the motor that will, ultimately, drive the machining tool. In this case, you’ll have a choice of stepper and servo motors. However, this is far from the only important tool: you’ll also need to include a PSU, breakout board, drivers, and—of course—a processor or computer.\n9. Put the table top on\nYou can’t machine parts without having a place to put them! Your cutting table can be made of plywood, MDF or metal. Bear in mind, however, that not all of these materials will be suitable for the type of CNC machine you’re creating!\n10. From rotational to linear movement\nThe motor you’ve installed will cause the machine to spin. However, your CNC machine will typically require linear motion. A spindle converts the rotational motion of the motor to linear motion, meaning that your machining tool will be able to move up and down.\n11. Choose your controller\nA CNC controller is vital to the operation of a CNC machine. This is the part that interprets the signals given by your processor or computer, and transforms them into signals for the electronic parts of your CNC machine. As such, it acts as the “brain” of the entire system.\n12. Select your software\nYour machine is now almost operational! First, however, you’ll need to choose the software that controls your CNC machine. Most of these will use languages such as G-code to control the movement of your machine along its three axes, enabling you to perform the action of machining.\n13. Add your machining tool\nThere are a wide variety of machining tools available. Metal cutting tools are one of the simpler varieties, but more elaborate machines may use laser or plasma cutting tools.\n14. Start making things!\nYour machine is now complete, and you’re ready to start tackling your own projects!\nWhy build your own CNC machine?\nIf you’ve read this entire article, then chances are that you’re already sold on the benefits of building a CNC machine. However, if you’re still unsure, we’ll quickly run through some of the best reasons to build your own CNC machine:\n- Customizability. When you buy a CNC machine, it may lack features you need—or make you pay extra for features you don’t. If you build your own CNC machine, you have the ability to choose what (not) to include.\n- Save money. Purchasing a ready-made CNC machine can often set you back thousands of dollars. Building your own CNC machine instead can give you the same results for a much lower cost.\n- Create awesome things. Okay, so this applies to any CNC machine, regardless of whether you buy or build. But it remains true—building a CNC machine gives you the ability to manufacture your own amazing products. Whether you want to launch your own business, replace hard-to-find parts, or simply create custom products that aren’t available anywhere else, you can do it with a CNC machine. And where better to start as a maker than in building your own machine?']	['<urn:uuid:5737044f-d5b5-43b2-8676-ecec9e6dc9b0>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-01T22:47:46.423955	10	51	1834
172	Where did trick-or-treating come from and how much do people spend on it now?	Trick-or-treating originated in Scotland and Ireland where poor people would visit affluent homes to offer prayers for the dead in exchange for food or money. Today, Americans spend over two billion dollars on Halloween candy annually, with the average consumer planning to spend around $100 on Halloween items including candy, décor, cards and costumes in 2022.	"['As you are busily gearing up to get out and celebrate Halloween with your friends and family, perhaps you’ve actually wondered where on earth did this somewhat bizarre holiday come from? Who thought of trick or treating? Why do we dress up in costumes anyway? For all you curious folks, we’ve compiled a top 10 listing of the most important details of the history of Halloween. The holiday has changed a lot through history but one fact will always remain the same, Halloween is one of the most beloved holidays we celebrate every year and is considered to be the 2nd most commercially successful holiday celebrated in the U.S. As you don your best Halloween costume and hit the streets to do some serious trick or treating, here are some fun facts for you to keep in mind!\nPumpkins: Pumpkins are plentiful in the U.S. and are actually indigenous to the Western hemisphere. Normally harvested in October, pumpkins are most commonly orange, but these members of the gourd family also can be found in green, yellow, white, blue and tan! When the Irish immigrated to the U.S. they had been formerly making lanterns with scary faces in them out of turnips to use on ‘All Hallows Eve’, but they quickly switched to pumpkins because they were far easier to carve than turnips and were more readily available. A Halloween tradition was born!\nJack-o-Lanterns: The legend of the Jack-o-Lantern is actually based on a man named Jack. Legend states that a miserly, angry as well as evil man named Jack liked to play pranks on his fellow townspeople. One day Jack decided to mess with the devil himself and tricked him, trapping him up in a tree. Jack circled the tree trunk with crosses and other religious symbols and would not let the devil escape until he agreed that he would never take Jack’s soul into hell. Of course the devil had no choice but to agree to this bargain and he was allowed to go free. When Jack eventually died, he was far too evil to go to heaven but the devil was true to his bargain and did not take Jack’s soul into hell. Jack was forced to roam the earth for eternity. The devil did leave Jack with an endlessly burning ember, which Jack placed inside a turnip lantern to carry on his way as he eternally searched for his final resting place. The tradition of the lit Jack-o-Lantern carries on to this day!\nHalloween Parties: Back in ancient days, villagers would gather on All Hallow’s Eve for a celebration called Samhain, which marked the end of the Harvest and the beginning of their new year, which was November 1st. Large bonfires would be made and various rituals would be performed around these, including throwing the bones of slaughtered animals into the fire as an offering. This celebration was also thought to honor the dead, which these people believed could roam the earth freely in spiritual form on this night. It became commonplace to dress as one were dead in an effort to fool the spirits in hopes that any malevolent amongst them would leave them alone.\nImmigrants: Most of the traditions we have surrounding Halloween come from the Irish or other European immigrants who brought their ancient customs with them when they immigrated to the U.S. Halloween is an eclectic mixture of customs of the Irish, Catholic and the Romans. In particular, the highly superstitious Celts gave us many of the ideas for what we now know as Halloween. The Celts believed that the lines between the living and the dead were completely blurred on October the 31st and they were fearful of any mischief or problems that might be caused by these spirits when they returned.\nGhosts: Because of the ancient beliefs that the spirits of the deceased were out running rampant on All Hallows Eve, Halloween will always have a close association with ghosts and spirits. Throughout history it has been common to tell ghost stories and folk tales involving spirits around the time of Halloween. These traditions have carried on today and it is common for people to create and visit attractions that are designed to appear ‘haunted’ as part of a way to celebrate Halloween.\nMonsters: Aside from ghosts, over the years many other monsters have become associated with Halloween. Two of the most common are vampires and werewolves. Vampires are part of ancient folklore that tried to explain away why random plagues would cause groups of mysterious deaths in various villages. Superstitious people thought that these deaths must be due to a newly deceased person being actually ‘undead’ and rising from the crypt in order to feast on the blood of the living in order to maintain their life force. Potential werewolves, another mythological being, were picked out from amongst others by features such as uni-brows, hairy palms and having a middle finger that was longer than the other digits.\nCostumes: The first Halloween costumes were made in Ireland and were made of various types of make up and animal heads or skins. These costumes were made in an effort to ward off evil spirits, but during the celebration of All Hallows Eve, were also used in the ceremonies that were performed during various festivities. Fortunes were often told and it was common for various rituals to be performed during this time. Nowadays, although scary costumes are still worn on Halloween, the variety of costumes you will see cover many different categories including superheroes, pop stars, humorous costumes and historical figures as well.\nWitches: The word witch comes from the Old Saxon word ‘wica’, which actually means ‘wise one’. In ancient days, witches were originally considered to be healers who were very familiar with the use of herbs and other remedies to help the sick and otherwise afflicted. As Christianity spread throughout Europe, the church clergy unfairly labeled these ‘healers’, calling them devil worshipers or sorcerers, even though that was hardly the case. Early immigrants that still believed these old ancient superstitions regarding witches brought these rumors with them into the U.S.\nTrick or Treating: In the ancient days of Scotland and Ireland, it was common practice on All Hallows eve for the poor or less fortunate to go to the homes of more affluent people and offer prayers for the dead in exchange for food or money. This practice was once again brought to the states by immigrants and eventually evolved into the custom of trick or treating, as we know it today.\nCandy: Candy is the preferred ‘treat’ of trick or treaters, the most favored of all being chocolate bars. The number one chocolate bar favorite amongst trick or treaters is Snickers. Consumers will spend over two billion dollars on Halloween candy this year. Over twenty five percent of all candy purchased annually in the U.S. is bought for Halloween purposes.\nHalloween is one of the most beloved holidays out there. Knowing a little bit of the facts surrounding its magical history will help you to understand and enjoy it all the more! Happy Halloween!', ""SCENE + HEARD: Today's Read Skeletons, Spellcasting, ‘Stranger Things’ and Spending: A Look at 2022’s Halloween Trends By Gwendolyn Plummer Friday, September 30, 2022 8:30 AM NEW YORK—October has arrived, and for many people that can only mean one thing: Halloween season is in full swing. There are just 30 days until the sweetest and spookiest day of the year, and, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF), Americans are taking full advantage of the witching season. The NRF reported that Halloween spending is back to pre-pandemic levels this year, with Halloween sales up to $10.6 billion in 2022, up from $10.1 billion in 2021. Consumers are planning to spend $100 on average for Halloween candy, décor, cards and costumes; the NRF said that this amount is on par with last year’s record of $103 and is the second highest in the survey’s history. So, if people are spending all that money on Halloween costumes, décor and candy, what exactly are they buying? Each year, Google Trends releases Google Frightgeist, a tool that compiles Google searches and data to determine the most popular Halloween costumes. The 2022 version hasn’t been shared yet, but the 2021 data is still available to peruse. Last year, Google found that “witch” was the trendiest costume, followed by “rabbit,” “dinosaur,” “Spider-Man,” and “Cruella de Vil” rounding out the top five. Frightgeist also lets users toggle between national and local trends, so you can see what your neighbors and coworkers are likely planning to wear this Halloween, too. For this year’s data, we can turn to Spirit Halloween, the U.S.’s largest Halloween retailer. So far, Spirit Halloween’s most popular costumes have been Hocus Pocus costumes, maybe because the classic movie’s highly anticipated sequel releases this weekend. “Witches” in general follow, and the third category is broadly “TV and Movie,” encompassing costumes from cultural phenomena like Stranger Things, Ted Lasso and movie superheroes. The NRF’s research echoes Spirit Halloween’s, reporting that “Spider-Man” is the top trending costume, with “witch” in third place. When it comes to décor, there’s one trend that seems to be taking over the rest: giant lawn decorations. From Home Depot’s famous 12-foot skeleton to oversized jack-o-lanterns and massive inflatable ghosts, bigger is better this season, House Digest suggests. If your style is more understated, though, there are still plenty of options: Hocus Pocus is trending in décor, too, reports House Digest, and so is more subtle Halloween-themed dinnerware that might even be adaptable year-round. All of this Halloween spending echoes a general return to pre-pandemic spending overall, says the NRF’s president and CEO Matthew Shay: “Halloween is an exciting time for many families, and that enthusiasm is reflected in the number of Americans who plan to celebrate the holiday this year. As consumers continue to return to pre-pandemic behaviors, retailers are prepared to meet that demand and help make this holiday a fun and memorable one.” The retail data seems to indicate that Americans are excited for Halloween, and are willing to spend money to celebrate it. For ECPs and retailers, of course, the trending data is great for getting involved on social media or in-office. From Instagram costume contests to 12-foot skeletons in exam chairs, there’s no shortage of ways to adapt this year’s Halloween trends to the optical industry. And with 30 days left to get involved, there’s plenty of time, too. So let’s get spooky.""]"	['<urn:uuid:415ca75b-a9c5-470d-94c4-d87d44fb87fa>', '<urn:uuid:a6fa1997-b69e-4a0b-a604-4785e960d4b9>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-01T22:36:12.692263	14	56	1750
401	How do blazar plasma jets accelerate particles, and what technology detects them at the South Pole?	Blazar plasma jets accelerate particles through magnetic reconnection, which involves rapid breaking and reconnection of magnetic field lines in ionized gas. This process converts magnetic energy into thermal and kinetic energy, accelerating plasma particles to produce ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with energies of 1018 to 1020 electronvolts. These particles are detected at the South Pole by the IceCube telescope, which consists of at least 70 strings of optical detectors deployed in 2.4-kilometer-deep holes drilled into Antarctic ice. Each string contains 60 optical detectors housed in volleyball-sized glass spheres with highly sensitive light detectors and sophisticated electronics.	"['Computer models designed and run by astrophysicists from Brazil and abroad reproduced the generation of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays by a mechanism of magnetic acceleration associated with the activity of blazars—galaxies with an active nucleus that emit an intense jet of plasma (ionized gas) towards Earth. At the center of every blazar is a black hole whose mass is millions or even billions of times greater than the Sun. After consuming the matter it attracts, the black hole blasts a stream of electrically charged subatomic particles perpendicular to its axis of rotation—known as a plasma jet. This stream of ionized matter can travel through space at about 300,000 kilometers per second, close to the speed of light.\nCosmic rays that are accelerated in these environments are the most energetic particles in the Universe. Many particle physicists are interested in determining what types of celestial bodies and processes produce them. “In our simulations, we were able to accelerate low-energy protons inside a turbulent jet using a mechanism known as magnetic reconnection, producing cosmic rays with energies in the order of 1018 to 1020 electronvolts [eV],” says Elisabete de Gouveia Dal Pino of the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics, and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of São Paulo (IAG-USP), coordinator of the group that created the computer model as part of a project funded by FAPESP. “These results support the hypothesis that blazars may be one of the sources of the most extreme cosmic rays.” Data from the studies were presented in two articles published in the Astrophysical Journal in 2021 and are set to be described in new papers later this year.\nThe expression “cosmic rays” refers to electrically charged particles (protons, electrons, and nuclei of atoms) and neutral particles (neutrinos, neutrons, and photons) that are produced in extreme celestial objects and travel through the Universe before eventually reaching Earth. Less energetic examples, such as solar wind, are more abundant and probably arise through phenomena that occur within the Milky Way. Those with more energy are seen less frequently and tend to come from farther away. Particles of the highest energy are generated outside the Milky Way, as has already been verified by the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina, funded by several international agencies, including FAPESP and the CNPq (see Pesquisa FAPESP issue nº 260).\nIn 2005, Dal Pino and American astrophysicist Alexandre Lazarian of the University of Wisconsin, USA, proposed the mechanism of magnetic reconnection as one of the possible ways ultra-high-energy cosmic rays are produced. Magnetic reconnection is characterized by the rapid breaking and reconnection (hence the term) of the magnetic field lines of an ionized gas, as occurs in jets of particles produced by the black holes at the centers of galaxies, including blazars. The process converts magnetic energy into thermal energy (heat) and kinetic energy (accelerating the plasma particles), often resulting in explosions. Phenomena like solar flares (sudden eruptions on the surface of the Sun) and auroras in Earth’s polar regions occur due to rapid reconnection of magnetic field lines. In the case of cosmic rays, it was previously unknown whether the mechanism is strong enough to explain the generation of the most energetic particles in the Universe.\nStudies by Dal Pino’s group suggest that at least in plasma jets produced by blazars, magnetic reconnection appears to be capable of producing extremely energetic cosmic rays. Dal Pino’s team used numerical computer models to generate a system that emulates the behavior of these plasma jets, and then introduced instabilities that led to rapid and turbulent magnetic reconnection. In the simulations, some of which lasted hundreds of hours, the researchers wanted to see whether any particles were able to gain enough speed to be considered ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. According to the group’s work, the answer is yes. “In the simulations, we injected hundreds to thousands of low-energy protons that are accelerated by magnetic reconnection in the turbulent fluid of the jet,” explains Tania Elizabeth Medina Torrejón, a Peruvian physicist currently on a postdoctoral fellowship at the IAG and one of the authors of the articles. “Over time, we saw an exponential growth in the energy of these particles.”\nIn 2018, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, located near the South Pole in Antarctica, recorded the first documented source of high-energy neutrinos associated with blazars, a type of particle that can only be produced by protons with extremely high energy. The superaccelerated particles came from a blazar named TXS 0506+056, about 5.7 billion light-years from Earth, where a black hole emits a jet of plasma toward Earth (see Pesquisa FAPESP issue nº 270). “This blazar also generates strong gamma-ray and neutrino emissions. We recently reconstructed these emissions using the magnetic reconnection acceleration model,” says Mexican astrophysicist Juan Carlos Rodríguez-Ramirez, another postdoctoral fellow in the IAG group. The production of gamma rays is set to be studied in detail by the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), designed to be the largest ground-based astronomical instrument for observing of this type of radiation. The CTA is a €350-million project, led by Europeans with the participation of astrophysicists from Brazil (see Pesquisa FAPESP issue nº 312).\nInvestigation of high energy phenomena and astrophysical plasma: Theories, numerical simulations, observations, and development of instrumentation for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) (nº 13/10559-5); Grant Mechanism Thematic Project; Principal Investigator Elisabete de Gouveia Dal Pino (USP); Investment R$14,836,626.42. 17/12188-5.\nMEDINA-TORREJÓN, T.

Comprising a total of at least 70 such strings, the $272 million telescope will be the largest scientific instrument ever built. Designed to detect cosmic neutrinos – ghost-like high-energy particles from deep space – it will open up a new window to the sky and allow scientists to investigate the still-mysterious sources of cosmic rays.\nIceCube is a joint international effort involving more than 20 institutions from the USA, Germany, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Great Britain, Japan and New Zealand. German contributors are the research center DESY with its location in Zeuthen close to Berlin, and universities in Berlin, Dortmund, Mainz and Wuppertal. The major part of the telescope and its construction is being financed by the National Science Foundation (NSF), with $30 million in support coming from European partners.\nIn a common effort, DESY and the German universities will deliver more than a quarter of the around 4200 optical modules that are to be deployed over the next six years. 1300 volleyball-sized glass spheres, each of them housing a highly sensitive light detector and sophisticated electronics, will be assembled and tested at DESY in Zeuthen. “The first IceCube string, which was successfully lowered into the ice in late January, already comprises eight optical modules produced in Zeuthen,” says physicists Rolf Nahnhauer, who is responsible for the production of the modules at DESY. Setting the string into the Antarctic ice required drilling a 2.4-kilometer-deep hole using a novel hot-water drill. “The detectors are then frozen in place in the ice,” explains Nahnhauer. “The first string is working perfectly, and data from the string and the surface tanks is now being transmitted to the Northern Hemisphere.”\nPetra Folkerts | alfa\nDiving robots find Antarctic seas exhale surprising amounts of carbon dioxide in winter\n16.08.2018 | National Science Foundation\nDiving robots find Antarctic winter seas exhale surprising amounts of carbon dioxide\n15.08.2018 | University of Washington\nNew design tool automatically creates nanostructure 3D-print templates for user-given colors\nScientists present work at prestigious SIGGRAPH conference\nMost of the objects we see are colored by pigments, but using pigments has disadvantages: such colors can fade, industrial pigments are often toxic, and...\nScientists at the University of California, Los Angeles present new research on a curious cosmic phenomenon known as ""whistlers"" -- very low frequency packets...\nScientists develop first tool to use machine learning methods to compute flow around interactively designable 3D objects.

It is the first major art museum (over $200 million endowment) to open in the United States since 1974. Over $317 million of the project\'s cost has been donated by Alice Walton. A 2013 Forbes\' ranking of the world\'s richest people placed the Wal-Mart heiress at No. 16, with an estimated net worth of $26.3 billion.\nIn 2005, art historian John Wilmerding was hired for acquisition and advice on museum programming. Wilmerding commented that Alice Walton ""will not spend at any cost"" and will do her ""homework on almost every individual acquisition and will ask for paperwork on market comparables"". He stated that often when an artwork became available through a private sale Walton would state ‘Wait, it will come to auction where we can get it at a better price,’ and she was usually correct. He also stated that the museum ranks at least in the top half dozen of American art museums. The museum\'s ""quality and its range and depth already place it among one of the very best.""\nHeadlines were generated after delays in construction and considerably higher costs for the museum than originally proposed to the city of Bentonville, Arkansas led to concerns about the favorable tax exemptions granted to the museum from the state in 2005 to secure its construction. Total tax losses to the state of Arkansas and the city of Bentonville are estimated at $17 million based on the financial disclosures given by the museum in the 2008 court case with Fisk University. The total amount of tax loss is estimated to have become considerably higher since then, but may never be disclosed due to the museum\'s guarded financial practices, including its decision not to disclose the amount spent since 2008 to secure collections, major art pieces, and lesser known works. However, the museum\'s IRS Form 990-PF notes acquisitions of $43.6 million during 2008, $81.9 million during 2007, $97.3 million in 2006. Through 2008, the total art acquisitions were at least $222.8 million.\nDon Bacigalupi was appointed director of the museum in August 2009. Previously, Robert G. Workman had served as director. In early May 2011, the museum announced three endowments by the Walton Family Foundation totaling $800 million. These endowments were established for operating expenses, acquisitions and capital improvements. The operating endowment, totaling $350 million, is being used to contribute to the museum\'s base annual operating expenses expected to total between $16–20 million per year. The acquisition endowment, totaling $325 million, will be used to fund additions to the museum\'s permanent collection. The remaining $125 million will be used as a capital improvement endowment to fund future improvements to and maintenance of the museum.\nCollaboration with other museums and institutions\nIn the past few years, Crystal Bridges has been in the news for numerous arrangements and partnerships with other art museums to share collections.\nIn 2006, the museum partnered with the National Gallery of Art in an attempt to purchase Thomas Eakins\' The Gross Clinic from Thomas Jefferson University. Under the terms of the agreement, the two museums agreed to pay a record $68 million, but the university gave Philadelphia 45 days to match the offer. The Philadelphia Museum of Art and Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts agreed to collectively match the offer and the painting remained in Philadelphia. The purchase forced both museums to sell some of their best Eakins pieces including Cowboy Singing and the The Cello Player. In April 2007, Crystal Bridges acquired another Eakins belonging to Thomas Jefferson University entitled Portrait of Professor Benjamin H. Rand for an estimated $20 million\nWalton held talks with Randolph-Macon Woman’s College in Lynchburg, Virginia in spring of 2007. The college was exploring selling part of the Maier Museum of Art\'s collection, but voted instead to sell select items from the collection at Christie\'s.\nIn 2006, Fisk University agreed to sell a 50% stake in a 101 piece Stieglitz collection to Crystal Bridges for $30 million. The collection was donated to the university by Georgia O\'Keeffe in 1949. This agreement became tied up in a legal battle between Fisk and the Georgia O\'Keeffe Museum in New Mexico, but the museum withdrew its lawsuit. The Tennessee Attorney General attempted unsuccessfully to stop the sale. In October 2010, a judge ruled that a 50% stake in the collection could be sold to Crystal Bridges if modifications to the contract were made so that Fisk University could not lose its interest in the collection, nor could the joint venture holding ownership of the collection between Fisk University and Crystal Bridges be based in Delaware (or outside Tennessee Courts). The modified agreement would allow the works to stay at Fisk University until 2013 and then begin a two-year rotation with Crystal Bridges. In April 2012, the Tennessee Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision to allow the sale to move forward. A few months later on 2 August, The Davidson County Chancery Court approval a Final Agreed Order that establish joint ownership between Fisk and Crystal Bridges through the newly established Stieglitz Art Collection, LLC. The operating agreement required Fisk to set aside $3.9 million of the $30 million sale proceeds to be used to establish a fund for the care and maintenance of the collection at the Carl Van Vechten Gallery at Fisk. The court dispute cost Fisk $5.8 million in legal fees.\nCrystal Bridges has announced a four-year collaboration with the musée du Louvre in Paris, High Museum of Art in Atlanta, and the Terra Foundation for American Art. The resulting exhibitions, featuring works from the collections of all four partners, will be seen in Paris, Bentonville, and Atlanta, beginning in 2012.\nThe museum\'s permanent collection features American art from the Colonial era to contemporary work. All of the featured artists are United States citizens, though some spent most of their art careers in Europe. Notable works include a Charles Willson Peale portrait of George Washington as well as paintings by George Bellows, Jasper Cropsey, Asher Durand, Thomas Eakins, Marsden Hartley, Winslow Homer, Eastman Johnson, Charles Bird King, John LaFarge, Stuart Davis, Romare Bearden, Norman Rockwell, Mary McCleary, Agnes Pelton, and Walton Ford. Also included are works by Chuck Close, Jasper Johns, Alfred Maurer, Jackson Pollock and Tom Wesselman. Two works, Richard Caton Woodville\'s War News from Mexico and Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait\'s The Life of a Hunter: A Tight Fix were included in American Stories: Paintings of Everyday Life, 1765–1915, a traveling exhibition organized by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Woodville painting was deaccessioned by the National Academy of Design, and was purchased in 1994 by Detroit collector Richard Manoogian. The piece was later purchased in 2004 by Crystal Bridges.\nIn May 2005, the museum purchased a coveted Asher B. Durand landscape entitled Kindred Spirits from the New York Public Library for more than $35 million in a sealed auction. In September 2012, the museum announced the acquisition of a major 1960 painting by Mark Rothko entitled No. 210/No. 211 (Orange). The abstract expressionist painting had been in a private Swiss collection since the 1960s and had only been shown in public twice.\nSculpture also figures prominently in the collection, on view in interior galleries and along outdoor sculpture trails. Sculptors represented in the permanent collection include Paul Manship, Roxy Paine, Mark di Suvero, and James Turrell.\nSelect auction results by date for items in the collection (including buyer\'s premium) are:\n- Green River, Wyoming by Thomas Moran, purchased 5 December 2002 for $2.9245 million\n- George Washington by Charles Willson Peale, purchased 18 May 2004 for $6.1675 million\n- Robert Louis Stevenson and his wife by John Singer Sargent, purchased 19 May 2004 for $8.8 million\n- Orca Bates by Jamie Wyeth, purchased 19 May 2004 for $360,000.\n- Portrait of Anne Page by Dennis Miller Bunker, purchased 1 December 2004 for $3.592 million\n- A French Music Hall by Everett Shinn, purchased 1 December 2004 for $7.848 million\n- The Indian and the Lily by George de Forest Brush, purchased 1 December 2004 for $4.824 million\n- The Studio by George Bellows, purchased 1 December 2004 for $2.472 million\n- Spring by Winslow Homer, purchased 1 December 2004 for $2.024 million\n- Ottoe Half Chief, Husband of Eagle of Delight by Charles Bird King, purchased 1 December 2004 for $1.352 million\n- Wai-Kee-Chai, Sanky Chief, Crouching Eagle by Charles Bird King, purchased 1 December 2004 for $792,000\n- Portrait of Carolus Duran by John Singer Sargent, purchased 2 December 2004 for $724,300\n- Sick Puppy by Norman Rockwell, purchased 2 December 2004 for $511,500\n- George Washington (The Constable-Hamilton Portrait) by Gilbert Stuart, purchased 30 November 2005 for $8.136 million\n- Mrs. Theodore Atkinson, Jr. by John Singleton Copley, purchased 30 November 2005 for $3.376 million\n- Marquis de Lafayette by Samuel F.

315	I live in Mali. How much has rainfall decreased here in the past 50 years?	In Mali, average rainfall has decreased by about 200 millimeters over the past 50 years.	['Africa’s climate already poses grave risks to the continent’s people and economies, and global warming promises to intensify the problem. A factual risk-management solution can help.\nEven before global warming became an issue, many African countries were unusually vulnerable to floods, droughts, and heat waves. Indeed, if there were to be no further change in Africa’s climate, its current state already presents grave risks to the continent’s people and economies. Global warming could trigger more frequent and severe weather disasters, shifts in rainfall patterns and climate zones, and rising sea levels.\nFor African nations, adapting to these possibilities is an urgent necessity. To do so, their leaders must answer some difficult questions. What climate-related losses could these economies sustain over the coming decades? How much can be averted and through what measures? Which investments will be required to finance them? Will the benefits outweigh the costs? We believe that such questions can be answered systematically through a factual risk-management approach that African leaders can use to assess climate’s impact on their countries and to find ways of minimizing it at the lowest cost to society.\nKnowledge about future climate trends—particularly their local impact—is incomplete, so policy and investment choices must be made under uncertainty. Yet enough is known to build plausible climate change scenarios as a basis for these decisions, even in developing countries. Such scenarios can help decision makers to identify adaptation measures useful against a range of climate change outcomes. Cost-effective responses can address much of the identified risk: depending on the country studied, 40 to 70 percent of the losses expected by 2030 could be averted—even under severe climate change scenarios—through adaptation measures whose economic benefits outweigh their costs. In almost all cases, however, at least some risk cannot be averted through known measures.\nMany adaptation measures would strengthen economic growth in developing countries; in Mali, for instance, climate-resilient agricultural development could generate millions of dollars annually in additional revenues. Measures with demonstrated net economic benefits could also attract investments and trigger valuable new innovations and partnerships. Indeed, well-targeted, early investments to improve climate resilience—through infrastructure development, technological advances, capacity improvements, new systems and behavior, and risk transfer measures—will probably be cheaper and more effective for the world community than complex disaster relief efforts after the event.\nA fact-based approach can provide valuable input into the overall decision-making process. Among other things, it recognizes the importance of cost–benefit considerations, makes it possible to put “price tags” on current and future climate risks, and lets decision makers develop plans to help businesses adapt to them.\nMali: Climate zone shift\nIn northwestern Africa, stretching deep into the Sahara, Mali is a mostly dry nation, subject to frequent droughts. Increasing temperatures and decreasing rainfall tell of a shift in climate zones as the desert moves south over productive land. In these regions, farmers dependent on agriculture and livestock already face trying periods of drought and have few options to overcome them. Many are moving to the cities, others to the country’s less arid south. Our study focused on Mopti, an important agricultural area in the central region.\nMali has a wide variety of natural environments, ranging from a Saharan climate in the north to the more tropical south. From year to year, its rainfall levels are among the world’s most variable. Annual floods during the rainy season in the Niger River’s interior delta benefit agriculture but may harm local populations (Exhibit 1). Mali also faces additional hazards from climate change: drought is expected to increase in frequency and severity, weakening the country’s agriculture and GDP. The climate zone shift—the combined effect of rising average temperatures and declining average rainfall—has already pushed the country’s agroecological zones to the south over the past 50 years, with average rainfall down by about 200 millimeters and average temperatures up by 0.5°C over the same period.\nDesertification and climate zone shift have multiple causes, with complex interactions. The impact from climate change is aggravated by farming and domestic practices, such as slash-and-burn agriculture (which erodes the soil) and deforestation, mostly to meet 90 percent of Mali’s cooking and heating requirements. (Forest cover has decreased by almost 50 percent since the 1980s.) Nonetheless, local adaptations could eliminate a significant share of the loss due to climate change, and it is important to recognize that farmers have already developed the kinds of techniques that will help them cope. Diversity in crop cycles—already widely practiced by Malian farmers—will be essential. Genetic variation in plants helps to make agriculture in areas with higher climate risks more resilient to them. Also advantageous will be the farmers’ tendency to spread out geographically for access to different types of soils and water sources.\nIn 2006, the value of Mali’s crops and livestock was estimated at $840 million and $620 million, respectively. Projections to 2030 take into account the most valuable agricultural crops (cotton, maize, millet, rice, and sorghum) and livestock (for eggs, meat, and milk). Following historical expectations, the five main crops’ value would increase by 46 percent, to $1,220 million (1.6 percent annual growth). In a more optimistic scenario, that level would more than double, to $2,470 million (4.6 percent annual growth).\nScenarios and responses\nThe significant uncertainty about climate change has spawned a range of climate projections for rainfall, while temperatures are consistently projected to increase significantly. Local climate models allowed us to consider three scenarios for a climate zone shift by 2030. Under the moderate-change one, temperatures would rise by 1.2°C and annual rainfall would decrease by 2.2 percent. The high-change positive scenario projects an increase in rainfall and temperatures of 8.1 percent and 0.9°C, respectively, while the high-change negative scenario anticipates a decrease in rainfall of 10.6 percent and an increase in temperatures of 1.4°C. Under all three, Mali would suffer economic losses by 2030. The pessimistic high-change scenario could involve losses of about $300 million annually (some 15 percent of the value of agriculture and livestock); the optimistic scenario, losses of $120 million annually (6 percent).\nThese losses will probably be offset, to some extent, even in the absence of specific adaptation measures. Agricultural production in Mali is likely to increase in value through the encouragement of farming in the regions best suited to it and the promotion of the right mix of crops. The human migrations required should happen naturally. Still, such measures would not cover the full expected climate-related economic decline.\nMeasures to increase productivity by encouraging the development of assets primarily in the most promising areas could compensate for losses elsewhere. Simulations show that by 2030, a migration of one million people could raise agricultural production by 6 percent more than population growth spread evenly across regions would. The migration of 1.5 million people by 2030 could raise production by an additional 8 percent—an overall 14 percent increase compared with the base case. But such controversial measures might promote conflict and increase competition for resources. Infrastructure and asset-based measures could make semi-arid areas substantially more resilient, however, so accelerated migration isn’t essential.\nSuch measures depend on the specifics of each natural environment, so we assessed a few promising possibilities for the Mopti region (in the middle of the country), which well represents Mali’s diverse agroecological zones. The southwest of Mopti, near the Niger River’s internal delta, is suitable for rice cultivation, horticulture, fishing, and livestock. The east and north, with a hotter and drier climate typical of the Sahel (the region on the fringe of the Sahara), is more appropriate for dry crops such as millet and sorghum—and threatened by the desert’s advance and the struggle to find water.\nAsset-based adaptation measures, such as soil techniques, irrigation systems, and the provision of additional water for cattle, would help to “climate proof” yields. Of the measures reversing the losses, about three-quarters would have benefits higher than their costs. Other measures would generate additional agricultural revenues—for instance, by extending the land area suited to horticulture, providing for two harvests a year rather than one, or encouraging additional products and practices (for instance, by mixing agriculture and forestry in crop fields). The generation of new revenue, essentially another adaptation alternative, has massive potential but requires careful consideration of its secondary effects on society. For the Mopti region alone, revenue-generating cash crops could cover much if not all of the expected loss for the entire country. In other words, these measures are essentially economic-development activities.\nEnablers and barriers\nMany measures we identified are labor-intensive, so the availability and use of local workers can constrain both the potential and the speed of deployment. Labor is an additional cost, but nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) often finance measures in exchange for free work by farmers. Since machinery frequently produces better cost–benefit ratios, however, the desire to help the local workforce must be weighed against the advantages of using more efficient but expensive machines. Building local water holes for livestock close to villages during the dry season, for example, can take two months for a team; a bulldozer can dig one in a day. The workforce is usually idle during the dry season, though, so the choices are quite complex.\nThe many cost-effective measures—which were analyzed, through local experiences and suggestions, and which make sense from a purely developmental perspective—should be led by the players typically involved. Government engagement will be required for larger-scale infrastructure measures, such as irrigation in the delta. NGOs are likely best suited for smaller-scale measures. International institutes can provide important expertise on issues such as crop engineering and meteorology. Given the complexity and magnitude of the challenges, support from the international community will be critical.\nAn effective portfolio of climate resilience measures can be assembled at limited cost. The key is to create the right enabling environment to provide for effective adaptation to climate change as well as economic development.\nTanzania: The impact of drought\nDuring the past 30 years, Tanzania has experienced six major droughts. The most recent, in 2006, is estimated to have cut GDP growth by 1 percent. Two specific effects of drought are of special concern. The first is the threat to human health posed by malnutrition and the spread of cholera and other water-borne diseases resulting from fresh-water shortages. Second, power generation in Tanzania depends predominantly on hydroelectric plants; during the 2006 drought, for example, the country faced severe power rationing because of a shortfall of water in reservoirs.\nOur study focused on the drought-prone central regions (Dodoma, Singida, and Tabora)—where various local climate models allowed us to build realistic scenarios for climate evolution. Under the moderate-change scenario, these regions are projected to experience a 10 percent decrease in annual rainfall and a 25 percent increase in the variability of the amount of rainfall—changes that would lead to more severe and frequent droughts. Under the high-change negative scenario, rainfall would decline by 20 percent and variability increase by 50 percent.\nThe central regions are primarily rural, and a majority of their 4.4 million inhabitants are poor subsistence farmers. This population faces a range of serious drought-related health risks: for example, in 2003 a survey reported that 19 percent of children under five had suffered from diarrhea during the previous two weeks to the survey. Hydropower generation is also critically important in the central regions: the Kidatu and Mtera dams, located in or near them, contribute 50 percent of Tanzania’s hydropower production capacity.\nHealth: Effects and adaptation measures\nThe most important drought-related diseases prevalent in the central regions are cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, malnutrition, and trachoma (which causes blindness). By 2030, even if the frequency or intensity of droughts doesn’t change, 5 percent of the regions’ population is projected to endure hunger from poor yields; the same percentage will suffer from trachoma. Cholera and dysentery will be common as well, and diarrhea will afflict almost 200,000 children under five.\nIn the moderate-climate-change scenario, by 2030 a 10 percent decrease in average rainfall levels could raise the proportion of the population under food stress by 60 percent, with a significant increase in the number of cases of cholera and dysentery. Trachoma cases could double. The high-climate-change scenario worsens the prognosis, particularly for trachoma.\nOur study analyzed measures that could protect Tanzanians against drought-related health risks. Some are preventive: for instance educational programs for hygiene, sanitation, and breastfeeding; the building of covered wells with pipes and ventilated pit latrines; and the harvesting of rainwater. Others are treatments, such as oral rehydration therapy and the administration of antimicrobials and zinc supplements.\nIt will not always be easy to distinguish spending for adaptation to climate change from development spending on health. Water access measures, for instance, could prevent thousands of cases of cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, and trachoma but could be considered sound policy no matter how the region’s climate evolves. Health spending should become more forward-looking rather than reactive.\nPower generation: Impacts and adaptation\nIn 2030, Tanzania is predicted to rely on hydropower for more than half of its electricity. Ninety-five percent of this hydropower will come from the central regions, but drought will decrease the water flow in rivers and thus cut the amount of electricity generated. The Tanzania Electricity Supply Company will have to make greater use of more expensive natural gas and coal—thus also increasing greenhouse gas emissions—or cut the supply of electricity. In the latter case, companies with diesel generators will bear the extra cost of using them, and the production of other 40 percent will fall.\nIn the high-change negative scenario, the expected losses would cut the national GDP by 1.7 percent in 2030. Even in the moderate-climate-change scenario, GDP will fall by 0.7 percent, solely because of climate change–induced droughts. Tanzania could close most of the expected shortfall in power production if it were to implement energy efficiency measures, such as reducing demand by encouraging less (or more careful) usage in the residential and commercial sectors—moves that would save more money than they would cost. In addition, reducing spillage at hydro stations could significantly increase the power supply almost free of charge. No-regrets energy efficiency measures such as these could be implemented immediately.\nWe do not know how much or how soon the global climate will change because of rising greenhouse gas emissions, but we do know that a country’s ability to cope with climate change will depend on its socioeconomic position. The poorest developing economies face especially difficult challenges both in addressing their current climate risks and adapting to new ones. For them, linking climate responses with economic-development strategies will be vital. A fact-based approach that considers both costs and benefits can help.']	['<urn:uuid:1ffc3654-ce67-4c2c-9fa3-80cb3775f998>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-01T23:21:14.341336	15	15	2421
232	how many residents michigan wind farm opt out	More than 50 residents signed documents requesting to be removed from the commercial wind overlay district, with signatures dated between April 6 and April 14. According to Jeff Smith, the county's building and zoning director, the county has never had so many opt-outs.	['BAD AXE – The county is considering lawyering up in response to a list of more than 50 residents asking to be excluded from an area being primed for a batch of 50 to 70 wind turbines.\nCounty attorney Stephen Allen this week said county commissioners should hire outside legal counsel to determine whether allowing that many residents to opt out would create spot zoning.\nSpot zoning, which many sources say is generally a bad practice, can occur when officials zone a small area or parcel for uses contrary to surrounding areas.\nThe zoning could conflict with a county’s master plan and allow for land use not afforded to the large majority of nearby parcels.\nPut simply, officials say it creates a zoning area that looks like Swiss cheese.\nSpot zoning is typically ruled invalid if challenged in court, according to the nonprofit Michigan Association of Planning. Michigan’s Zoning Enabling Act of 2006 and Planning Enabling Act of 2008 make no mention of the term.\nJohn Nugent, a county commissioner and planner, says there will be a resolution on the board of commissioners’ agenda next week to spend up to $2,500 to clarify whether Huron’s scenario would create spot zoning.\nNugent says the list of residents wanting out of the project creates an “extraordinary situation.”\nDocuments included in a packet for a board of commissioners meeting read: “We the undersigned residents of Lincoln Township hereby request to be removed from the commercial wind overlay district. Signed April 2016.”\nThe documents list more than 50 signatures with addresses, dated between April 6 and April 14. Some are from landowners already under easement with DTE, including Lincoln Trustee John Wisneski.\nJeff Smith, the county’s building and zoning director, says the county has never had so many “opt-outs.”\nSmith also asked why some who signed leases with DTE now want out of the project, without giving explanation – considering some may have already cashed checks, he said.\nAllen says he’s worked as corporate counsel for the board of commissioners since 1999, but that he doesn’t get involved in the wind energy overlay process. He advised the county seek Detroit-based Clark Hill PLC for legal counsel.\nDTE Energy is in early stages to build 50 to 70 turbines across four townships.\nA project planning area covers 61 square miles and more than 39,000 acres – 22,000 in Lincoln Township. DTE says it has 21,000 acres under contract for wind development with about 100 landowners and is talking with other landowners.\nDTE says its plan far exceeds county requirements.\nProject Manager Matt Wagner says Allen’s advice applies to site plan review, a stage that planners aren’t at.\n“I have no doubt that we’ve met the requirements,” Wagner told county planners.\nMember Terry Heck asked how “overwhelming opposition” factors in if all planning and zoning requirements are met.\n“It doesn’t matter if people … don’t like it,” Allen said.\nIf all requirements are met and officials make a decision based on reason, “they’re stuck with it,” he said. Disallowing the project in such case would be capricious, according to Allen.\nHowever, officials noted the option of a referendum, which a resident may initiate by collecting signatures within the zoning jurisdiction to reverse such a decision.\n“People always have the final say,” Planning Vice Chair Bernie Creguer said.\n|Wind Watch relies entirely\non User Funding']	['<urn:uuid:cc6dfe54-6374-4877-b491-b3c7171b77e6>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-01T22:36:12.692263	8	43	558
173	institutional investor comparing gold palladium stability profit margin	Gold shows more price stability compared to palladium during market fluctuations. When prices fall, gold remains steadiest while palladium is hardest hit. This is evidenced by gold's modest 20% decline from its peak in 2022, compared to palladium's dramatic 80% drop from $3,440.7 to $1,854 per ounce. Additionally, GOLD stocks show a net profit margin of 3.91% with current earnings growth of 18.52%.	['A block trade is a significant transaction involving the buying or selling of securities that is conducted privately, away from the public markets. Its purpose is to minimize the impact on the price of the security. Typically, block trades are carried out by hedge funds and institutional investors through investment banks and other intermediaries. However, high-net-worth accredited investors may also have the opportunity to participate in these trades.\nAccording to the criteria set by the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, a block trade involves a minimum of 10,000 shares of stock or a value exceeding $200,000. For instance, in the present scenario, a block trade is taking place involving GOLD. The trade consists of 964,472 shares being exchanged at a price of $16.32 per share, which is slightly higher than the ask price of $16.31. To maintain confidentiality and disguise the true magnitude of the trade, it is likely that different brokers will be involved in executing this transaction.\nIt should be noted that the specific exchange on which this block trade is occurring has not been specified in the information provided. Nonetheless, the CME Group offers the opportunity to execute block trades for futures, options, or combination transactions that are permitted to be conducted separately from the public auction market.\nBarrick Gold Corporation\nUpdated on: 28/09/2023\nDebt to equity ratio: Buy\nPrice to earnings ratio: Strong Sell\nPrice to book ratio: Strong Buy\nDCF: Strong Buy\n12:00 PM (UTC)\nDate:28 September, 2023\n|Analyst / firm||Rating|\nBank of America Securities\nGOLD Stock Performance: Mixed Results on September 19, 2023 with Positive Turnaround in Earnings Growth\nOn September 19, 2023, GOLD stocks experienced mixed performances. The previous close for GOLD stocks was at $16.68, and today’s open was slightly higher at $16.72. Throughout the day, the stock fluctuated within a range of $16.20 to $16.75. The trading volume was 14,976,724, which is higher than the average volume of 13,188,653 over the past three months.\nLooking at the company’s financials, GOLD has shown a significant decline in earnings growth over the past year, with a decrease of 78.54%. However, there has been a positive turnaround this year, with earnings growth of 18.52%. Looking ahead, the projected earnings growth for the next five years is a modest 2.00%. The revenue growth for the previous year was -7.40%, indicating a decline in sales.\nIn terms of valuation, the P/E ratio is not available (NM), suggesting that the company may have negative earnings. The price/sales ratio is 2.74, which indicates that investors are willing to pay $2.74 for every dollar of sales generated by the company. The price/book ratio is not provided, so it is difficult to assess the company’s value based on its book value.\nTaking a closer look at the individual stock performances, Newmont Corporation (NEM) experienced a decrease of $0.16, which translates to a decline of 0.41%. Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (AEM) also saw a decrease of $0.50, representing a decline of 1.00%. Gold Fields Ltd (GFI) had a smaller decrease of $0.08, resulting in a decline of 0.65%.\nLooking ahead, the next reporting date for GOLD stocks is set for November 9, 2023. Analysts forecast an EPS of $0.27 for this quarter. The net profit margin for GOLD stocks is 3.91%, indicating the company’s ability to generate profit from its revenue.\nGOLD operates in the Non-Energy Minerals sector and falls under the Precious Metals industry. The corporate headquarters of GOLD is located in Toronto, Ontario.\nOverall, GOLD stocks had a mixed performance on September 19, 2023. While there was a slight increase in the stock price at the opening, it fluctuated within a range throughout the day. The company’s financials show a decline in earnings growth over the past year, but there has been a positive turnaround in the current year. The next reporting date will provide further insights into the company’s performance.\nAnalysts and Investors Bullish on Barrick Gold Corp Stock Performance: Promising Investment Opportunity in 2023\nOn September 19, 2023, Barrick Gold Corp saw its stock performance being discussed by analysts and investors. According to data from CNN Money, 21 analysts provided 12-month price forecasts for the company’s stock. The median target price was estimated to be 22.25, with a high estimate of 30.00 and a low estimate of 17.20.\nThe consensus among 25 investment analysts polled is to buy stock in Barrick Gold Corp. This rating has remained unchanged since September.\nBarrick Gold Corp reported earnings per share of $0.27 for the current quarter. Additionally, the company’s sales for this period amounted to $3.4 billion.\nInvestors and analysts eagerly await the reporting date of November 9, when Barrick Gold Corp will release more detailed financial information for the current quarter.\nThe positive sentiment among analysts and investors, as well as the projected increase in stock price, suggests that Barrick Gold Corp is currently viewed as a promising investment opportunity.\nHowever, it is important for investors to conduct their own research and consider various factors before making any investment decisions.\nIt is worth noting that the information provided is based on data from September 19, 2023, and stock prices and forecasts are subject to change based on market conditions and other factors. Therefore, it is advisable to consult up-to-date sources and seek professional advice before making any investment decisions.', 'Precious metals analyst Sanjiv Arole examines the market forces that are driving palladium’s fortunes.\nAlthough palladium was classified as a precious metal only in 2009, it became the most expensive precious metal in 2019. Palladium has topped $2,300 per ounce (against platinum’s all-time of $2,273 per ounce in 2008) on umpteen occasions. In fact, palladium topped $3,000 per ounce for the first time on 4th May, 2021.\nThe Ukraine war too triggered off a rally in palladium as it scaled a fresh all-time high of $3,440.7 per ounce (intra-day) on 7th March, 2022. Although gold managed to be at par with palladium on a few occasions this year, palladium still remains the most expensive of (non)precious metals in the precious metals basket.\nThe palladium price has gained by over 6% to $2,018 per ounce on 2nd September, 2022 as compared to $1,893 per ounce at the beginning of the year. It was the only precious metal to have gained as of 2nd September this year, while the rest of the precious metals all showed a decline in price as compared to the beginning of the year.\nGold fell by 5.78% to $1.712.50 per ounce while silver decline sharply by 27.34% to $17.92 per ounce, platinum too slipped by 16.07% to $840 per ounce.\nAs Russia accounts for a substantial portion of palladium supplies in the world, the Ukraine war will continue to have an impact on the palladium price in the remainder of the year as well.\nThe crowning glory for palladium in the immediate aftermath of the Ukraine war was when its price scaled an all-time high of $3,440.7 per ounce on 7th March, 2022. In sharp contrast, the palladium prices dipped by a whopping 80% to $1,854 per ounce on 20th July, 2022.\nGold’s decline from its peak of $2,039 per ounce for the year was more subdued at around 20% as gold slumped to $1,694 per ounce on 1st September, 2022. Silver and platinum too declined, by over 47% and 38%, respectively, from their highest to their lowest levels. However, as far as year-to-date prices were concerned, palladium was the only one that remained in positive territory. If one were to look at the average prices, then all the precious metals showed a decline in the average price year-to-date as compared to the average price for the previous year. Gold declined by just over 1%, while palladium fell by 14%. Silver and platinum fell steeply by 23% and 21%, respectively. Overall, it once again supported the view that when the price surges, gold climbs the slowest, while palladium and silver lead the way. But, when prices fall, gold is the steadiest, while palladium and silver are the hardest hit. Platinum is usually between gold and the other high-flyers.\nComing to the fundamentals of palladium as per the Johnson & Matthey PGM Market Report 2022. Some of the salient features for 2021 are:\n(a) Russia is the largest primary palladium supplier accounting for around 40% of mined production. In 2021, Russian mine production was 2,689 thousand ounces.\n(b) In 2021, palladium prices scaled $3,000 per ounce on liquidity concerns following the flooding of mines in Siberia. However, increased supplies from South Africa saw the price slump to below $1,600 per ounce in December.\n(c) High prices incentivised scrap yards to expedite reprocessing palladium-rich catalysts. Secondary supplies increased as a result of the backlog of auto scrap as well. However, as the price declined so did the scrap inflows.\nThe outlook for 2022:\n(a) The Ukraine war has resulted in uncertainty over shipments from Russia in 2022. In fact, J&M has not made any forecasts for palladium supplies from Russia. Then, South African supplies are set to fall in the current year due to plant maintenance, etc.\n(b) Expected weaker car sales to hit recycling of vehicles, less vehicles for scrapping.\n(c) Any recovery in auto PGM demand likely to hit due to supply constraints and Covid-19 restrictions, particularly zero-Covid tolerance in China and the resultant lockdowns there.\n(d) Industrial palladium demand to be hit due to high prices.\n(e) Since Russia is the largest palladium supplier in the world, supply disruption from Russia could give rise to inflation and depress growth. This would be further accentuated with palladium ingots from Russian refineries being unacceptable as ‘good delivery’ bars in London and elsewhere from April 2022.\n(f) Average platinum content of a gasoline car in 2022 is forecast to rise by over 66.6% compared to 2021. Automakers in Europe and North America are set to begin fitting tri-metal catalysts in greater numbers, reflection substitution efforts to replace palladium with platinum. Even China is expected to ramp up substitution. Overall, a tumultuous time for PGM metals, particularly palladium\nMeanwhile, US Fed Chief Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole symposium sent chills across global stock markets as well as commodity markets. The symposium was held from 25th August, 2022 and Powell’s comments on inflation were far more hawkish than anticipated. His overwhelming focus on inflation was reflected in the usage of the word inflation around 44 times in his speech.\nPowell stated that all his efforts would be centred on bringing inflation down to 2% from the current 9%, implying that higher than normal interest hikes would continue till inflation numbers slide down. He added that while higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labour market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses. They are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean greater pain.\nJerome Powell appears to be on the verge of throwing caution to the winds in his relentless pursuit of taming inflation. He seems to be oblivious of the lower GDP growth, higher debt servicing of long-term debt weighing down on the US economy, trade sanctions, Covid-19 hovering around, and the likely harsh winter for most of Europe due to fuel shortages as a backlash against sanctions by Russia and above all the Ukraine war.\nIn his endeavour he has embarked on a path of rapid rise in interest rates to tame inflation. In the game of brinkmanship, he is risking job losses and lower growth giving way to even recession. While higher interest rates could encourage savings account holders, it could hurt the stock markets as well as the precious metals market.\nGold, in particular, would wait with bated breath to see the outcome of the monetary policy statement later in the week. If the Fed continues it hawkish trend (a further substantial hike as in July), then gold could be under enormous pressure of a strong dollar as well as an option for savings in banks accounts. Thereby, gold could sink further along with the rest of precious metals.\nA recovery in the gold price could be seen only when it transpires that inflation cannot be tamed despite the rate hikes or the Fed end the rate hikes citing victory over inflation.\nWill palladium still remain in positive territory even if the Fed continues to hike interest rates? As they say, ‘the proof in the pudding is in the eating’. Wait and watch!']	['<urn:uuid:8074c8dd-940e-423e-ba27-9b7b26fbde95>', '<urn:uuid:f98cd933-b322-4819-92b9-5bf92cde845e>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-01T22:36:12.692263	8	63	2075
913	How do emperor penguins manage eye adaptation in different environments, and what's unique about their breeding location compared to other birds?	Emperor penguins have distinctive diamond-shaped pupils when constricted, and are one of the rare exceptions to birds having circular pupils. They are the only bird species that breeds on ice and breeds during the Antarctic winter. They don't build nests - instead, the male balances the egg on top of his feet, and the colonies are located on fast ice close to permanent openings in the sea ice called polynyas.	"['The emperor penguin is the largest of all living penguins, standing to 1.1 m (3.7 ft.) tall and can weigh more than 41 kg (90 lbs.).\nThe smallest of the penguins is the little penguin, standing just 41 to 45 cm (16 to 18 in.) and weighing about 1 kg (2.2 lbs.).\nThe penguin\'s body is adapted for swimming. Its body is fusiform (tapered at both ends) and streamlined. A penguin has a large head, short neck, and elongated body.\nThe tail is short, stiff, and wedge-shaped.\nThe legs and webbed feet are set far back on the body, which gives penguins their upright posture on land.\nAll adult penguins are countershaded: dark on the dorsal (back) surface and white on the ventral (underside) surface. The dark dorsal side blends in with the dark ocean depths when viewed from above. The light ventral side blends in with the lighter surface of the sea when viewed from below. The result is that predators or prey do not see a contrast between the countershaded penguin and the environment.\nMany species have distinct markings and coloration.\nThe emperor penguin has a black head, chin, and throat, with broad yellow patches on each side of the head.\nThe king penguin has a black head, chin, and throat, with vivid orange, tear-shaped patches on each side of the head. The orange coloration extends to the upper chest.\nThe Adélie penguin has a black head and distinctive white eye rings.\nThe gentoo has a black head with white eyelids, and a distinct triangular white patch above each eye, usually extending over the head\nThe top of a chinstrap\'s head is black and the face is white, with a stripe of black extending under the chin.\nThe crested penguins (genus Eudyptes), such as the rockhopper and macaroni, are distinguished by orange or yellow feather crests on the sides of the head, above the eyes.\nThe southern rockhopper\'s species name, chrysocome, means ""golden haired,"" a reference to the golden yellow crest feathers above its eyes.\nThe yellow-eyed penguin, as its name suggests, has yellow eyes and a stripe of pale yellow feathers extending from the eye to the back of its head.\nThe little penguin, also known as the little blue, has slate-blue to black feathers and a white chin and chest.\nTemperate penguins (genus Spheniscus), such as the Humboldt and Magellanic, have unfeathered fleshy areas on the face and one or two distinct black stripes across the chest.\nChicks, juveniles, and immature penguins may have slightly different markings than adults. Generally, they appear duller in color than adults. Adult markings take a year or longer to develop.\nGenerally, penguins are not sexually dimorphic: males and females look alike. Crested penguins are exceptions: the males are more robust and have larger bills than females.\nWhen seen in pairs during breeding season, royal penguins are one of the easiest penguins species to visually identify males from females. Males have larger bills and white cheeks while females often have gray colored cheeks.\nWings are modified into paddle-like flippers. The bones are flattened and broadened, with the joint of the elbow and wrist almost fused. This forms a tapered, flat flipper for swimming.\nEach flipper is covered with short, scale-like feathers. The long wing feathers typical of most birds would be too flexible for swimming through water.\nInstead of having wings like other birds, penguins have tapered, flattened flippers for swimming.\nPenguins propel themselves through the water by flapping their flippers.\nDifferent species of penguins can be identified by their head and facial markings.\nPenguins have a variety of bill shapes. A penguin captures fish, squid, and crustaceans with its bill.\nGenerally, the bill tends to be long and thin in species that are primarily fish eaters, and shorter and stouter in those that mainly eat krill.\n- The mouth is lined with horny, rear-directed spines to aid in swallowing live prey.\n- The color of irises varies among the species.\n- Many species have brown, reddish-brown, or golden-brown eyes.\n- Rockhopper and macaroni penguins have red eyes.\n- Fairy (little blue) penguins have bluish-gray eyes.\n- As their name implies, yellow-eyed penguins have yellow eyes.\nNearly all birds studied have circular pupils. Rare exceptions include the king and emperor penguins. The pupil of an emperor penguin becomes ""diamond-shaped"" when strongly constricted.\n- A king penguin\'s normally circular pupil changes to small, square-shaped pinholes when constricted. A king penguin\'s pupil area can adjust from brightness to the darkness of the ocean as they dive to hunt. In fact, the area of their pupils can change an amazing 300-fold — more than any bird species known.\n- Like other birds, penguins have a nictitating membrane, sometimes called a third eyelid. This is a clear covering that protects the eye from injury.\nLegs & Feet\nPenguin legs are short and strong. Feet are webbed, with visible claws. The legs are set far back on the body to aid in streamlining and steering while swimming. This placement also causes penguins to stand vertically and walk upright.\nPenguins walk with short steps or hops, sometimes using their bills or tails to assist themselves on steep climbs.\n- The maximum walking speed for Adélie penguins is 3.9 kph (2.4 mph.)\n- Emperor and king penguins walk slowly and do not hop.\n- Some species, like the rockhopper penguins, jump from rock to rock.\nWhen traveling on ice, Antarctic penguins often ""toboggan"" on their bellies. They use their flippers and feet to slide their bodies forward along the ice.\nA penguin\'s tail is short, and wedge-shaped, with 14 to 18 stiff tail feathers. Adélie, gentoo, and chinstrap penguins (collectively known as brush-tailed penguins) have longer tail feathers, which they often use as a prop when on land.\nShiny feathers uniformly overlap to cover a penguin\'s skin. Penguin feathers are highly specialized. They are short, broad, and closely spaced. This helps keep water away from the skin. Tufts of down on the feather shafts increase the insulative properties of the feathers.\nPenguins have more feathers than most other birds, with about 100 feathers per square inch.\nMost penguin species go through one complete molt (shed their feathers) each year, usually after the breeding season. The exception is the Galápagos penguin, which usually goes through two molts per year.\nMolting is essential because feathers wear out during the year. Feathers become worn when penguins rub against each other, come in contact with the ground and water, and regularly preen (clean, rearrange, and oil) their feathers.\n- The new feather grows under the old one, pushing it out. The old feather does not fall out until the new one is completely in place. The molt is patchy and can give individual penguins a scruffy look.\n- During the molt, feathers lose some of their insulating and waterproofing capabilities, and penguins stay out of the water until their plumage is restored to optimal condition.\n- Depending on the species, the average length of the molt varies from 13 days for the Galápagos penguin to 34 days for the emperor penguin.\n- Penguins fast when molting. Prior to this, they each build up a thick layer of fat to provide energy until the molt is complete.', 'Emperor penguins are superlative birds. The largest penguin, they are the only bird that breeds in the depths of the Antarctic winter, and they can dive deeper (500 m) and survive longer without eating (4 months) than any other bird. Emperor penguins are also the only bird species that breeds on ice, and one of the few birds that doesn’t build a nest – the male balances the egg on top of his feet. When combined with their stunning good looks and ridiculously cute chicks, it is little wonder that emperor penguins command so much attention.\nEmperor penguins are very large penguins that could only be confused with the related, smaller king penguin. They are dark silver-grey on the back, and white on the breast and belly. The diagnostic broad pale patch on the side of the neck is yellow in adults and dull white in juveniles. Adults have a black head and chin, while juveniles have a chin colour that may vary from white to dark grey. The slender, decurved bill has a pink stripe on the lower mandible (paler in juveniles). Recently fledged chicks are about half the size of adults.\nVoice: a powerful, klaxon-like bray.\nSimilar species: king penguin is smaller and more brightly coloured, with a relatively longer bill. The pale neck patch is narrower (spoon-shaped) and dark orange in adults. When swimming, king penguins have smaller, brighter neck patches that do not reach the water, compared to the larger paler neck patch of the emperor penguin that extends to the water line.\nDistribution and habitat\nEmperor penguins are characteristic and abundant denizens of the Antarctic pack-ice. The 46 known colonies are scattered around the entire Antarctic continent, with almost all colonies located on fast ice (sea ice attached to the land) close to permanent openings (polynyas) in the sea ice. These polynyas, maintained by winds or currents, allow breeding adults to access feeding grounds during incubation and chick-rearing, including when the sea ice is at its annual maximum extent. The world population was estimated at 595,000 breeding pairs in 2009.\nAdults are rarely seen beyond the pack-ice, which extends to about 60° S at its maximum extent south of New Zealand. Juveniles tracked by satellite after leaving their natal colonies have been found to swim well north of the pack-ice, up to 54° S. Vagrants have occurred up to 40-41° S off Argentina and New Zealand.\nNew Zealand records\nThe two New Zealand records are contrasting tales. A bird in adult plumage came ashore on Oreti Beach, Southland, on 5 April 1967, and was released without fanfare off Dog Island, Foveaux Strait, the following day. The second record was an immature bird ashore on Peka Peka Beach, Kapiti coast, 20-24 June 2011, before being taken into care following excessive consumption of sand. This bird became a media sensation (widely known as ‘Happy Feet’), and was eventually released north-east of Campbell Island on 4 September 2011.\nBehaviour and ecology\nThe emperor penguin takes the generic penguin feed-and-fast lifestyle to extremes. They lay down extensive subdermal body fat, providing both insulation and energy reserves. This fat allows them to survive weeks or months without feeding during courting, incubation, chick care, moult, and the often lengthy transit between the sea and breeding colonies. As a result, the body weight of emperor penguins fluctuates greatly between about 23 and 45 kg. Males can lose up to 45% of their bodyweight during the 4 months that they are continuously at the colony from the start of courtship (March-April) through to after the egg hatches (July-August).\nThe single large egg is incubated entirely by the male for 62-67 days, with the female returning to the sea for 2 months until soon after the egg hatches. The egg, and later the young chick, is balanced on its parents’ feet during brooding. This mobile ‘nest’ allows the adults to move around, including forming their famous huddles during severe mid-winter blizzards. Both parents feed the chick through to fledging in December, timed to occur as the sea-ice breaks up in summer.\nBreeding adults moult in January-February, with juveniles and non-breeders moulting in November-December, either at colonies or elsewhere on Antarctic continent and sea ice. They first breed when about 5 years old, and have a life span of at least 20 years.\nEmperor penguins mainly consume fish, also squid and krill, captured by pursuit diving. Dives are of up to 18 min duration, typically to depths of 50 metres, exceptionally to over 500 metres. Chicks are fed by regurgitation by both parents.\nFretwell, P.T.; LaRue, M.A.; Morin, P.; Kooyman, G.L., Wienecke, B.; Ratcliffe, N.; Fox, A.J.; Fleming, A.H.; Porter, C.; Trathan, P.N. 2012.

1129	malolactic fermentation discovery year peynaud	The fermentation of malic acid as a useful and controllable process was discovered by Peynaud in 1956.	"[""Malolactic fermentation & lactic bacteria\n(based on Emile Peynaud’s Connaissance et Travail du Vin)\nAlso a useful scientific paper available here\nWhat is malolactic fermentation?\nAfter draining off the wine from the vat in which alcoholic fermentation takes place, a second 'finishing' phase takes place, a slower fermentation 'd'achevement' 'de finition'. Carried out correctly, malolactic fermentation softens and rounds out the wine, and increases microbiological stability. If it is not carried out (or if more harmful bacteria go to work on the wine), the wine can become hard, tough and with overly high Total Acidity.\nIt's a fermentation of malic acid by lactic bacteria rather than yeasts. Think of it also as a chemical de-acidification that breaks down the malic acid. Characteristics of 'mouelleux'/round mouthfeel are associated with lower acidity. For fine wines, malolactic fermentation can be seen as the first step of qualitative ageing and stability.\nThe presence of lactic acids in wine was first observed over a century ago, but it's only been 50 years since the recognition that the fermentation of malic acid could be both useful and controlled (because often it happened spontaneously at the end of alcoholic fermentation before ecoulage if the cuvaison is prolonged and so went unnoticed). This was discovered by Peynaud in 1956\nBacteria usually become visible very early on during alcoholic fermentation (after a few days).This is not the beginning of an infection, as was previously thought, but these are malolactic bacteria which are beginning to develop. In some years (or in certain winemaking estates who make this choice) malo takes place slowly over winter if it's mild enough to allow the wine to remain fizzy (they seem to be fermenting all winter even though they no longer contain any sugar). In other cases it happens as temperatures warm up in spring, even summer. The rise in temperature allows the bacteria to be 'activated' if there is malic acid in the wine still.\nIn northern regions particularly (septentrionales in french) grapes retain high levels of malic acid even after fermentation and can be almost undrinkable without this malolactic fermentation. They can regularly keep 8-10g of fixed acidity without it!\nUsually during alcoholic fermentation totaly acidity drops by between 1.5 and 3 grams per litrqe. So maybe 6.5g/l (sulfuric acid) to 3.8. This is not due simply to a tartric precipitation (as used to be believed), but the disappearance of malic acid. At the same time the quantity of lactic acid increases.\nGlobal reaction = malic acid (1g) becomes lactic acid (0.67g) + carbonic acid (0.33g or 165cm3)\nThe carbonic gas produced escapes and the wine becomes fizzy. This is the direct reason for the lessening of overall acidity (it is 'escaping' through the fizzy carbonic acid). Malic acid has two functions while lactic acid only has one. By transforming malic acid into lactic acid, about half of the total acidity is lost because it has transformed into volatile carbonic acid, which then disengages from the wine, turning into bubbles of carbonic gas, and disappears into the atmosphere.\nAt the same time, there is a slight increase in volatile acidity, of around 0.1-0.2g/l. This is partly due to the lactic bacteria attacking traces of sugar and citric acid (most usually by the coques bacteria) at the same time as they are attacking the malic acid. Because of this, it is not advised to add citruc acid during vinification.\nThe higher the levels of malic acid at the start, the greater the gustatory impact of this secondary fermentation. The improvement to the taste and mouthfeel comes because there is an overall lowering of total acisity, and because the malic acid, which has a markedly aggressive taste, is replaced by lactic acid, which is far less aggressive to your tastebuds. Remember after the transformation 1g of malic acid gives around 0,67g of lactic acid.\nThe colour of the wine will often become a little softer and rounder also after the secondary fermentation. The aromas will also have been modified, getting further away from the colours of the grape and closer to more nuanced colour of 'wine'. The texture will become more fleshy and rounder in red wines.\nIt is less easy to generalise with white wines. Not all regions find this secondary fermentation desirable or necessary.\nIn dry whites, even when it's possible, it does not always lead to an improvement in quality. White wines are primarily judged on their aroma and on the delicate balance between alcohol and acidity. The freshness given by acidity is essential in some dry whites.many white wines are able to take up to 4.2-4.5g total acidity by keeping their malic acid.\nIn other regions, or depending on vintage, it can be useful. Regularly carried out in Champagne, Burgundy, Switzerland, Maconnais. In Germany and Austria, they prefer usually to use a chemical disacidification. In regions where acidity is naturally low, malo would leave the wines flabby. It's a question of grape varieties, and personal taste. Some varieties lose their aromatic typicity if undergo a fermentation by lactic bacteria, and lactic notes can dominate the fruit. In this case, better to sulphite the must to stop any secondary fermentation taking place (or do it on only a small part). Varieties that are very rich in natural aroma, such as chardonnay, find that malo just adds another layer of aromatic complexity (as with red wines).\nSo red wines basically all need malo, whites and rosés only under caution. Generally, if you are looking for freshness and primary aromas only, better to avoid it. But if looking for vinosity and volume, possibly a good idea.\nFor sweet wines, they are often sulfited early on in the process, before malo can take place. They do sometimes happen, but they are not wanted becausethey can lead to a rise in volatile acidity, which is already a risk in sweet wines.\nThe Bacteria of Malolactic Fermentation\nThe fermentation of malic acid is prompted by the development of lactic bacteria (cells that are able to turn sugar into lactic acid in the same way that yeast is able to turn sugar into alcohol). These bacteria can take various shapes, mainly falling into coques/cocci (round or oval), bacilles/batonnets (long & thin)\nStreptocoques (streptococci, think Guys and Dolls Adelaide singing about developing a cold - knew that song would come in useful throughout my life!)\nOften early in fermentation, it is tough to distinguish between the 'good lactic bacteria' that help with malolactic fermentation, and those lactic bacteria that will lead potentially to wine spoilage. And certain conditions (such as residual sugar or high pH/low acidity) can also make these lactic bacteria more likely to be harmful. Generally, the higher the pH, the more starins of lactic bacteria are likely to be present -sometimes up to 8 or 9 strains at moment of harvest. But not all will be capable of developing in the specific pH of grape must, or in presence of alcohol, or in competition with the yeasts etc. Yeasts find the sugar etc present in must easier to cope with, which is why they establish themselves more quickly than lactic bacteria. It's when they start to diminish that lactic acid bacteria take hold.\nSome are homo-fermentary (so do one thing - turn sugar into lactic acid) and hetero-fermenatary (so alongside lactic acid also produce alcohol acetic acid, succinic acid, glycerol, mannitol, carbonic gas etc).\nIn cold regions, cocci are more prevalent than bacillus and it hot regions its the opposite.\nWine lactic bacteria are either:\n1) Leuconostoc (cocques heterofermentary)\n2) Pediococcus (coques homofermentary)\n3) Lactobacillus (bacilles can be both homo and heterofermentary) - and most usually these contain the harmful bacteria also\n4) Oenococcus (only classified in 1995)\nThis classification is important because the malo will work differently, and give different results, depending on which strain if wine bacteria is present.\nThe lactic bacteria are found on ripe grapes at harvest, mised up with yeast, acetic acid bacteria and molds. Fairly irregular year to year. Probably also lactic bacteria in the buckets, pails etc used for harvesting and storing wine. Have to be v careful as cross-contamination possible at various stages of winemaking. Can also live in 'used barrels'. Equally a new cellar can make malolactic fermentation difficult to start.\nA young wine at the end of fermentation almost invariably has lactic acid bacteria capable of breaking down malic acid if the wine is not sulfited (homofermentary). Just a few contain lactic bacteria that is capable of also breaking down tartaric acid, glycerol, raising volatile acidity etc (heterofermentary). The population is greater in young wine than in the grape must.\nUseful and Harmful Lactic Bacteria\nOnce malolactic fermentation has taken place, the principles of 'bacteria are harmful' once again take precedence. Bacterial difficulties don't have to go as far 'piqure lactique' or the 'tourne' where all tartaric acid is consumed - more usually there effect is to raise the levels of acetic acid/volatile acidity and sometimes fixed acidity. The effect of this is a wine that seems dry of thin, lacking in the qualities that they should have, even if they don't seem especially 'faulty'. The harmful lactic bacteria are primarily in the lactobacillus genus.\nSo, there can be two types of lactic bacteria in wine:\n1) Bacteria capable of decomposing malic acid primarily, and sugars secondarily, and sometimes citric acid, but not tartaric acid or glycerol. These are the normal agents of malolactic fermentation. They are not dangerous except in stuck fermentations, when they can cause alterations such as volatile acidity - if there is residual sugar and/or high pH, if in non-sulphured environment.\n2) Bacteria capable of composing pentose, tartaric acid, glycerol, which are more unstable and potentially more harmful. These are the harmful bacteria.\nThe 'ideal' lactic bacteria would only decompose malic acid and not touch the other components of wine - this bacteria doesn't exist, but there are 'degrees of danger' according to the genus of bacteria, and the conditions of vinification, from pH to residual sugar.""]"	['<urn:uuid:39bed341-c661-4c32-b59b-7ff56621b42c>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-02T11:12:15.698123	5	17	1666
1132	what disasters affect company staff mental health	In a disaster, employees may have traumatic reactions to the event and may need counseling and professional help even after returning to business as usual. During live emergencies, people may react differently than in training - some may freeze and be unresponsive, while others may panic and flee.	"[""BACKGROUND IMAGE: iSTOCK/GETTY IMAGES\nMore than any other tool, people are often considered an organization's most important asset. A disaster or disruptive...\nevent can affect an organization's employees in different, and sometimes severe, ways. The ISO 22330 business continuity standard from the International Organization for Standardization provides a detailed look at what can happen to people in a disaster and offers suggestions on managing those effects.\nOfficially titled ISO/TS 22330:2018, Security and resilience -- Business continuity management systems -- Guidelines for people aspects of business continuity, the standard addresses people issues not previously covered.\nCommon people issues surrounding business continuity and disaster recovery (BC/DR) include awareness and training, exercising and testing, and incident response. The first four issues are largely part of the planning process, while the last applies to actual events. Incident response activities are typically focused on assessing the situation, ensuring that employees are safe -- and evacuated, if needed -- engaging first responders and activating emergency teams as needed.\nISO 22330 provides guidelines and a framework for the planning and development of policies, strategies and procedures to help prepare and manage people affected by an incident. Let's examine these in more detail:\n- Pre-event preparation: Awareness, analysis of needs and learning and development. A key part of the people process is to understand your organization and its people. This can be done in partnership with HR, as it has the most detailed information on employees. The ISO 22330 business continuity standard provides guidance on the above activities and can be used as a checklist to ensure that existing BC/DR programs address people issues in greater detail. Of the above issues, analysis of needs is probably the most important. This is where you can examine issues such as employees' family members and employees with special health requirements. The more you know potential staff issues in advance, the better your recovery is likely to be, especially from a people perspective.\n- Response phase: Dealing with the immediate effects of an incident. When faced with an emergency, people react in different ways. This is one reason that, when choosing members of an emergency response team, it's important to remember that people may react in an entirely different way when faced with a real emergency, as opposed to when they attend a training exercise. In an exercise, people are likely to perform their duties calmly and in complete control. However, in a live event, those same people may freeze and be unresponsive, or may panic and flee the situation as quickly as possible. It's almost impossible to know how people will respond until a real event occurs. That's one good reason to hold regular BC/DR plan exercises and emergency response plan drills.\n- Recovery phase: Managing people during the event. Noting the above realities of people responding to emergencies, ISO 22330 provides guidance on how to deal with a variety of situations. These can include what to do when employees are injured, how to aid employees who have a traumatic reaction to the event and how to communicate with family members and others. While each disruptive event is different, the impact on people is a major challenge.\n- Restoration phase: Ongoing support to employees after returning to business as usual. Even once a disaster has been addressed and resources have been brought in to help speed the return to business as usual, more still may need to be done to help employees. Injured employees and their care will need to be addressed. Employees who have not fared well emotionally may need counseling and professional help. These and other kinds of post-event activities are addressed in the new standard.\nPeople have always been part of BC/DR processes, but ISO's new standard raises the bar on the importance of people and their needs in a disaster. ISO 22330 provides an in-depth look at how to respond effectively to the needs of an organization's staff during and after the event.\nDig Deeper on Disaster recovery planning - management\nHave a question for an expert?\nPlease add a title for your question\nGet answers from a TechTarget expert on whatever's puzzling you.""]"	['<urn:uuid:be80cb8e-e6cb-4567-b0ce-bd9b6d25619d>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-02T11:12:15.698123	7	48	687
1052	I've been working with low concentration aerosols and struggling with particle deposition - what techniques are available to measure and increase the deposited dose in exposure systems?	For measuring dose, a quartz crystal microbalance can be used for surface concentrations above 20 ng/cm2, while image evaluation of microscopy images can estimate dose at lower concentrations. To increase deposition efficiency, an electric field can be integrated into the exposure module, which can increase the deposited dose up to tenfold depending on the aerosol's charge state.	"[""The current debates on driving bans in European cities show not only how important air quality is to the public but also reveal the lack of available methods to directly assess the adverse effects of air pollutants on human health. Exposing human lung cells to aerosols at the air-liquid interface, in a similar way to how this occurs in the open, promises significant advances and is increasingly being used by leading researchers worldwide.\nToday's legal thresholds for air pollution are partly based on epidemiological studies that correlate mortality and morbidity with measurements from public monitoring networks. The association found can demonstrate the impact of air pollutants on human health but cannot prove their immediate effects without additional toxicological data.\nIt is better to measure the biological effects of air pollutants directly as dose-response relationships. Therefore, additional animal experiments and in vitro cell culture assays are used to directly assess the impact of air pollutants on biological systems. OECD animal testing guidelines to measure the acute lung toxicity of chemicals do exist, but for ethical and financial reasons such tests are used only in isolated cases for air pollutants.\nMethods for assessing the toxicity of air pollutants using human cells have not yet been standardized. In most such laboratory experiments, collected particles are applied as a suspension to human lung cells. Not only are the conditions of these cell experiments non-physiological, the results obtained are not suitable to assess the effects of real-life, complex mixtures of aerosols resulting from incineration. The estimation of the applied dose is another difficult issue.\nAn automated system for reproducible exposure of human cells\nBelow we will present the techniques we developed for simultaneously measuring the biological effects and the particle dose of aerosols using an exposure system for human lung cells. This system enables both reproducible sampling and conditioning of aerosols as well as the exposure of cell cultures under conditions that are similar to those in the human lung. Large scale measurement campaigns have demonstrated the suitability of this system for complex combustion aerosols. The system is now being manufactured by the company Vitrocell Systems GmbH (Waldkirch, Germany) and is distributed worldwide (Fig. 1). Its basic principles were described by Paur et. al (2011) .\nFig. 1 (A) Exposure setting in an exposure chamber: the airborne particles are brought to the surface of the human lung cells through the aerosol inlet. (B) The automated exposure system to expose cells to aerosols (Photo: Vitrocell Systems GmbH)\nIn the exposure system, the cells are cultured in paralleled exposure modules on membranes supplied with nutrient medium from the base. The aerosol, which is classified through a size-selective inlet, is conditioned to a temperature of 37 °C and 85 % relative humidity and subsequently passed directly over the cell surface, where it settles. Control measurements in the parallel chambers allow replicates and simultaneous control measurements with clean air and filtered aerosol to be carried out and the deposited particle dose to be determined. The exposed cell samples are analyzed further using standardized bioassays to quantify biological endpoints that shed light on the mechanisms and effects of the aerosols. The dose-response relationship allows the toxicity, which can manifest itself in inflammation or damage to the DNA, to be assessed .\nExposing cell cultures at the air-liquid interface has several advantages. Direct sampling from exhaust fume flows eliminates the need for the time-consuming and error-prone particle collection on filters. Gases and particles can be sampled either simultaneously or separately. There is also no need to resuspend the particles in a biological medium, which could lead to chemical and physical changes in the particles and make it difficult to determine the actual applied dose. And lastly, like in the human lung, the particles are deposited directly on the cell surface without the possibility of an added solvent causing biological effects. Controlling the temperature, the humidity and the volume flow ensures high reproducibility of the deposition efficiency and therefore of the subsequent biological measurements as well. Recording all relevant physical parameters makes it easy to prove that the test procedure has been performed correctly or to identify any sources of error. The exposure system’s high level of automation guarantees compliance with the preset test protocol and thus the reproducibility of serial measurements.\nUnder standard conditions, only about 1.5 % of the particle concentration is deposited on the cells, which prevents overdosing. The applied dose can be determined by an integrated quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) if the surface concentration is at least 20 ng/cm2. At lower concentrations, image evaluation can be applied to microscopy images of exposed surfaces to estimate the dose where aerosol densities are known. To increase the deposition efficiency, an electric field was integrated into the exposure module. Depending on the charge state of the aerosol, this allows the dose that deposits to be increased up to tenfold.\nApplications for the cell exposure technique and outlook\nFig. 2 State of the art: Examined aerosols (top left column) and cell cultures (top right column) as well as bioassays from cell cultures and endpoints to determine the effects\nEspecially in recent years, research institutes and companies have increasingly been using the technique. Measurements of dose-response relationships were performed using the aerosols and cell cultures shown in Figure 2. Lacroix et al. (2018)  recently gave a review of the state of the art. When investigating complex combustion aerosols, the biological effects of gaseous and particulate pollutants can be determined simultaneously.\nCurrent research is aimed at extending exposure duration to 48 hours and increasing the deposited dose in order to use the procedure at the lower concentrations of the air in our environments. There is also a need to validate the method using animal experiments to reduce the use of laboratory animals in mandatory testing.\nCategory: Toxicology | Aerosols\n Paur, H.-R., Cassee, F.R., Teeguarden, J. et al.

803	What are proper hay sampling methods and nutrient components?	Proper hay sampling requires defining feed lots by field and harvest time, using a hay probe for representative samples, taking minimum 20 probes per lot, and splitting samples using cone and quarter method. Regarding nutrients, hay contains protein for tissue growth, carbohydrates for energy, fats for energy storage, vitamins A/B/C/E for metabolism, minerals like calcium/phosphorus for skeletal maintenance, and fiber for digestive function.	['With the first cutting of hay coming off fields in southern states, I am reminded that proper hay sampling procedures are a must. Today I was brought a sample from a single bale of mixed hay and asked to sort the alfalfa from the grass hay and use those as individual, separate samples. I was not the only one whose first reaction was, are they planning on sorting it out every time they feed? (Of course not!) For someone who is very passionate about providing producers with accurate, precise and above all else useful results, this request was difficult to stomach. No matter what species of animal is being fed, lab results are a useless waste of producer time and lab time if they are not representative of the entire pile of feed or stack of hay. So, when sampling hay and other forages the goal is to provide WARD Laboratories Inc. with a representative sample. Here are 5 steps to obtain a representative hay sample:\n- Define ‘lots’ of feed.\nA lot can be one field of the same or a mixed species which has been harvested and bales in one consecutive time frame. For example, if I had three fields two alfalfa and one mixed alfalfa and grass. I harvested and baled one alfalfa field, then the mixed field and then a few weeks later finally harvested and baled the second alfalfa field. I would define 3 separate lots based on species and time of harvesting and baling.\n- Use a hay probe.\nUsing a hay probe will ensure samples representative of each bale. The probe can cut through the side of the bale and take sample from deeper within the bale than a hand grab can. Additionally, a hay probe does not discriminate against delicate leafy material the way fingers do. A sample taken with a hand grab will test falsely low in protein and energy as the leafy material, which is high in protein and energy, slips through fingers.\n- Take a minimum of 20 probes per lot.\nIf the lot has less than 20 bales, then take one probe per bale. If more than 20 bales are in a lot take a minimum of 20 samples to represent that lot properly. The National Forage Testing Association has done research to prove this number of probe samples decreases likelihood of a non-representative sample. When choosing bales to probe it is also important to not leave out ‘bad looking bales’ or intentionally include ‘good looking bales’. Sample as randomly as possible. The best possible thing to do is come up with a system to determine which bales to sample and follow it each time you sample a new or different lot.\n- Split the sample using the cone and quarter method.\nOnce 20 cored samples are obtained, they will not all fit in a quart sized Ziploc bag. Therefore, the sample must be mixed and split until the sample is small enough to fit in the bag. On a tarp, large newspaper or other clean surface, mix the cores then pile them up into a cone like shape. Divide the cone into 4 quarters discarding two quarters diagonal to each other and repeating the process with the remaining two quarters. Continue the process until each quarter can fill a quart sized Ziploc bag. Then send one of those quarters to Ward Laboratories Inc. and save another quarter in a cool dry place. The saved sample may come in handy if the original gets lost in the mail, or a resample is needed for some reason.\n- Send the sample to Ward Laboratories Inc.\nWhen placing the sample in an envelope or mailer, be sure to include your name, address, phone number. Write the test on the sample bag or call into be sure you receive the information you want on your report.

Here is a infomative video by Dr. Mary Drewnoski, currently a Beef Systems Specialist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln:', 'The Different Types of Hay for Horses\nComponents of Hay\nGood quality, fresh hay, then, contains all the different nutrients your horse requires:\n- Protein – used for growth and repair of tissues\n- Carbohydrates – used for energy\n- Fats – used to store energy and as insulation against cold\n- Vitamins A, B complex, C, and E – used for a variety of metabolic processes\n- Minerals, most importantly calcium and phosphorus, which are used predominantly for skeletal growth and maintenance\n- Fibre – essential for function of the digestive system\nThe way in which types of hay differs is generally not in which nutrients they contain, but the proportions in which those nutrients are present. Nutrient density also varies from one cutting to another, so to really balance your horse’s diet, it’s best to have a hay sample tested to ensure you know exactly what’s in it. Many farmers will have this done as a matter of routine to check for quality.\nA general baseline to check for hay quality is in the percentage of crude protein. An adult horse in moderate work only needs about 10% protein in his diet, while growing, performance and breeding horses will need more.\nTypes of Hay\nClover hay is very similar to alfalfa, with a very high protein content and excellent palatability. Its\nCa:P ratio is also generally unbalanced, but the advantage of clover hay is that clover is usually planted alongside grass and then cut and baled with the grass hay, so the two hays are already mixed. This boosts the quality of a grass hay crop and eliminates the fuss of having to feed two different hays to your horse. However, some sneaky horses will pick out all the clover and leave the grass, so you have to keep a close eye on your horse’s intake.\nTypes of grass hay vary across the world, but in the US, timothy hay is by far the most popular. Good quality timothy is up to 10% protein, which is sufficient for most horses. It is high in fibre and thus optimises the horse’s digestive system while supplying a moderate amount of carbohydrates. Good quality, green timothy hay is also rich in well-balanced vitamins and minerals. Bermuda grass and orchard hays are very similar to timothy hay and can be fed almost interchangeably according to what’s available – and cheaper – in your area. Timothy hay is a safe bet, but almost always more expensive than bermuda grass or orchard hay. The only real disadvantage of these grass hays is that they do not contain enough carbohydrates and protein for performance or breeding horses, so must be supplemented with alfalfa or concentrate feed. Later in the season when the hay has lost its greenness, it may also be low in vitamins and minerals, so a balancer may need to be fed.\nAnother type of grass hay is oat hay. This hay has a similar protein content to other grass hays, but is significantly higher in carbohydrates. For a skinny horse who needs to pack on some pounds or a performance horse who needs some extra energy, oat hay can be great, but it is disastrous to feed to insulin resistant, overweight, or laminitic horses. It may also cause some horses to become hot and unmanageable to ride.']	['<urn:uuid:7dadf913-17cb-433c-875e-1246bf58fdf9>', '<urn:uuid:a816f16a-24dc-4a8f-b207-58b61f6dd7ae>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-01T23:46:40.222380	9	63	1252
1070	poor countries climate threats funding hurdles	Developing countries face severe climate threats including infrastructure loss, reduced agricultural production, food insecurity, floods, droughts, and disease epidemics. The financial challenge is substantial - they require $70-100 billion USD annually for climate adaptation, but currently receive only about $4.4 billion in adaptation finance. While the private sector could help bridge this gap, businesses face significant obstacles including insufficient climate data, uncertainty about impact timing and magnitude, and limited resources especially for small and medium enterprises in developing countries who lack access to affordable financial products like loans and insurance.	"[""How will climate change affect food production?\nFood is one of society's key sensitivities to climate. A year of not enough or…\nClimate change is a key development challenge that has significant effects on sustainable development. It poses a risk to sustainable development and achievement of the vision 2030 as it affects livelihoods, health and economic development among other sectors. Creating climate-resilient and low–carbon development path has become a development imperative and its integration is a prerequisite for sustainable development.\nThe National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS) reveals Kenya’s economy being susceptible to significant disruption from extreme climate events such as floods and droughts. Some of the clear indications of this situation include loss of infrastructure, reduced agricultural production, reduced food security, increased incidences of flooding and droughts, widespread disease epidemics, and increased risk of conflict over scarce land and water resources among others. Climate change affects all sectors, all counties and all peoples (men and women). However, its impacts will be distributed differently among all region and genders. The severity of its effects depends on the individual capacity or of the system to cope with the impacts.\nClimate adaptation is an urgent priority for the county decision makers and practitioners. Institutional capacities and regulatory framework to respond to avert climate change impacts are vital for economic, social and environmental management at the County levels. With the devolved government system, Counties are expected to consider certain factors in planning including environment, climatic conditions, economic disparities, marginalized groups and gender equity among others. Statistics show that development especially in the counties does not take cognizance of climate change issues into consideration. This situation can be blamed on the inadequate awareness of their implications on development, lack of enabling regulatory framework and the lack of skills to integrate them in planning. Devolved government system creates a need for enabling regulatory framework to support climate change actions and a comprehensive County Climate Change Action Plan.\nThe Green Belt Movement with support from the International Climate Initiative (IKI) and other development partners intended to develop comprehensive County Climate Change Action Plans to put in place mechanisms to enhance the implementation of the National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS) for Nandi and Nakuru Counties. The Institute for Environment and Water Management (IEWM) was mandated with the task to facilitate and guide the development process of the County Climate Change Action plans for the selected Counties as external consultant by the Green Belt Movement. The main objective of the consultancy was to develop enabling regulatory framework to support climate change actions and comprehensive County Climate Change Action Plans. IEWM would use a participatory and consultative approach throughout the entire process which drew upon views and perspectives of a number of key players and provided for a meaningful involvement of all the stakeholders that would either participate, or be impacted on by the implementation of the action plans or policy recommendations. Multi stakeholder dialogue meets were held for the two counties to develop the action plans, review County and national policy and legislative instruments on climate change with an aim of developing enabling regulatory frameworks that would promote coherence, coordination and cooperative governance to respond and avert climate change impacts at county level.\nThe Action Plans were made up of 3 sub-components which are not only distinct but are also closely linked and interrelated. This included;\nSub-component 1: Long-term County Low Carbon Development Pathway. This is designed to facilitate reflection and/or mainstreaming of climate change aspects in the counties integrated plans and it’s Medium Term Plans (MTP). It seeks to identify key elements of the counties low-carbon and climate resilient growth.\nSub-component 2: Enabling Policy and Regulatory Framework. This aimed to review County and National policy and legislative instruments relating to climate change with a view of developing policy and /or legislative frameworks that promotes coherence, coordination and cooperative governance of climate change issues at the county levels.\nSub-component 3: County Adaptation Plan. Recognizing that adaptation is a priority, this aimed to identify priority immediate, and medium and long-term adaptation actions in order to develop County Adaptation Plan.\nThe resultant outcome of the entire process would constitute;\nThe key deliverables of this process included;"", 'This is the first installment of WRI’s new blog series, Adaptation and the Private Sector. Each post will explore ways to engage the private sector in helping vulnerable communities adapt to the impacts of climate change.\nAdapting to the impacts of climate change—like heat waves, increased floods, and natural disasters—is an enormous challenge. It’s also one that comes with an enormous price tag. Although it’s difficult to calculate the extent of the costs, the World Bank estimates that developing countries need $70 to $100 billion USD per year through 2050 to meet their current and future climate adaptation needs.\nThe Climate Policy Initiative, however, estimates that in 2011, only $4.4 billion USD in adaptation finance went to developing countries. This leaves a gap of anywhere from $65.6 to $95.6 billion USD per year between what developing countries need and what developed nations are giving.\nSo who can help fill this gap?\nThe private sector may be the answer to this question. Already, proactive private companies are beginning to address climate change in their investments and business planning. With a little work on the part of the public sector, the private sector may be inclined to invest more in adaptation—to reduce their own risks, as well as those of vulnerable populations. Our new five-part blog series, Adaptation and the Private Sector, will outline some of the roles the private sector should play and the ways to support their contributions to climate change adaptation.\nBut first, it’s important to understand the progress that’s already being made and the challenges that exist.\nHow Is the Private Sector Responding to the Impacts of Climate Change?\nWhile corporations and businesses have reacted to international and domestic pressures to curb their CO2 emissions and invest in mitigation, they have been less engaged in building climate-resilient communities. They have little incentive to invest in an area that’s largely seen as a public good. If you look closely, however, you see that they are starting to make some progress.\nFirst, the private sector is engaged in adaptation; their goods and services are just not labeled as such. Businesses and individuals have a desire to protect their assets and livelihoods from climate change and are willing, if finances are available, to spend money on goods and services that provide this protection. Because demand is there, businesses will respond with new products. These products, however, aren’t marketed as “climate-resilient” and don’t come with an “adaptation-friendly” sticker. For example, buildings with a rooftop garden are marketed as green buildings or energy-saving strategies, yet they also provide adaptation benefits in the form of alleviating heat island effect.\nSecond, most private sector action on climate change has gone to “climate-proofing” operations. Companies are relocating buildings to low-risk areas, purchasing weather insurance, and reducing water and energy usage—which are all good practices that protect them against climate hazards. In some instances, such activities may even help vulnerable populations, as is the case when corporations climate-proof their supply chains. For global companies, suppliers can be small-holder farmers, miners, or artisans in developing countries. These suppliers can build their adaptive capacity when corporations make their own supply chains more resilient, such as giving farmers access to drought-resistant seeds. The public sector should look to support and encourage further action in this area.\nChallenges to the Private Sector\nThe private sector also faces a variety of challenges when dealing with climate change impacts. Addressing some of these challenges could go a long way toward creating a better enabling environment for the private sector.\nFirst, businesses need better, more actionable information on climate change and its projected impacts. Levels of long-term uncertainty are difficult to take into account when making short-term investment decisions. For example, a survey of 72 businesses found that most respondents thought climate change information was hard to incorporate into their business plans because of uncertainty about the magnitude, timescale, and precise location of climate impacts. Furthermore, scientific information about the climate system is difficult to decipher for many audiences, which compounds the challenge of making informed decisions on how to best respond. Businesses, therefore, need information from public and academic sources that help them make informed decisions on dealing with climate change impacts.\nSecond, while more and more corporations are investing in making their operations more climate-resilient, few small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are able to do so, due to lack of resources. They are unlikely to have in-house experts on climate change and sustainability, and their funds to bring in outside consultants are limited. SMEs, therefore, are less prepared for climate impacts and more likely to suffer from them. Furthermore, SMEs in developing countries often do not have key types of affordable financial products—such as loans and insurance—available to them. This lack of financial and technical resources makes it difficult for SMEs to invest in adaptation planning.\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list—the challenges to scaling up adaptation finance are numerous and complex. But by understanding these key limiting factors and acknowledging the current actions the privates sector is taking, we can already start to see ways that governments and the international community can support, encourage, and scale-up private sector adaptation actions and investments. Understanding the obstacles can help the public sector engage the private sector in making vulnerable communities more climate-resilient.\nOur ongoing blog series, Adaptation and the Private Sector will explore various ways to support and scale up private sector investments in climate change adaptation. Check back for the next installment, which will look specifically at the role multinational corporations can play in building more climate-resilient societies.\n- LEARN MORE: Check out a related blog post, Is Adaptation Short-Changed?

1018	looking for info about attorney fees personal injury case and extra insurance protection details	Most trial attorneys handle personal injury cases on a contingent fee basis, typically charging 33-1/3% to 40% of the gross recovery amount, and you only pay if there's a recovery. Additional litigation costs are separate from the contingent fee and can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars. Regarding insurance protection, personal umbrella liability insurance provides extra coverage beyond standard policies. However, it's important to verify that personal injury protection (covering issues like false arrest, libel, slander) is included in both homeowners and umbrella coverage, as it's not always automatic and may require additional endorsement.

We do not provide any warranty about the accuracy or source of the information contained on any of these servers or the content of any file the user might download from these sites.\n1. HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO BRING A LAWSUIT FOR A PERSONAL INJURY?\nAs the term “personal injury” is used here we mean physical and emotional injury arising from a motor vehicle accident, a slip and fall, medical malpractice and from a dangerous product. Generally, the statute of limitations for a personal injury is two (2) years. The most notable exceptions to this arise where an infant or mental incompetent is involved. It may arise also in a situation where the victim does not reasonably discover that he has been harmed by another. Again, these are just general exceptions to the rule. The safest course of action is to consult with an attorney well within two (2) years of the date of injury so that you can receive proper advice, and give your attorney proper time to investigate and prepare the case prior to the expiration of two (2) years. PLEASE NOTE: Other types of incidents may have statutes of limitation which are longer, or shorter.\n2. DO I REALLY NEED AN ATTORNEY? WON’T THAT BE TOO EXPENSIVE, OR SLOW THINGS DOWN?\nMany of our clients have hired us after months of fruitless negotiations with an insurance company who had assured them that they would receive a fair settlement and that they should not retain a lawyer. It is true that many smaller claims, particularly those which involve only minor personal property loss, can be settled without the intervention of an attorney. Nevertheless, an individual who has experienced a personal injury where there are doctor bills, ongoing treatment, lost wages, significant pain and suffering, and the potential for future impairment and lost wages, should consult with an attorney who is experienced in litigation matters.\n3. HOW CAN I AFFORD A LAWYER TO REPRESENT ME?\nMost trial attorneys are willing to handle personal injury cases on a contingent fee basis. The hallmark of the contingent fee is that the attorney will not charge you for his time unless there is a recovery. If there is a recovery, then the attorney’s fee is based on a pre-agreed percentage of the gross amount recovered. Typically, HAMSTEAD, WILLIAMS & SHOOK PLLC charges a 33-1/3% – 40% contingent fee, depending on the complexity of the case. Many law firms are known to charge up to 50% contingent fees. The contingent fee to the attorney does not include costs of litigation which may be incurred. These may range from a few hundred dollars if the case can be settled out of court without suit being filed, to tens of thousands of dollars in complex actions such as medical malpractice and product liability. Incurred costs are payable separately, and not as part of the contingent fee.\n4. WILL MY CASE WIND UP IN COURT?\nMost legal claims are resolved by settlement, before suit is even filed. Of those cases where suit has to be filed, the overwhelming majority of those are eventually settled without having to go to trial before a Judge and jury. HAMSTEAD, WILLIAMS & SHOOK PLLC’s philosophy is to vigorously pursue settlement well in advance of trial so that the claims process is not made unduly difficult and burdensome for our clients. Our firm places great stock in mediation as a means to settle a case once suit has been filed, thereby possibly eliminating the need for appearing at trial. One of the ultimate considerations in resolving a case is fairness. If a client is satisfied with a fair settlement, then we consider that we have been successful and that our job is done. However, if the insurance company for the other side, for whatever reason, is unwilling to offer a fair sum in settlement, then we will explain the entire situation including risks and benefits so that the client, with the help of his/her attorney, can make an informed decision: a decision which is right for him or her.\n5. CAN I SUE MY DOCTOR BECAUSE I AM NOT PLEASED WITH MY TREATMENT?\nA doctor is not responsible simply because a patient experiences a bad result. The law recognizes that a doctor is not responsible simply because an untoward event occurred or an optimal recovery was not attained. West Virginia law specifically provides that a medical provider is only responsible for injuries which directly result from that medical provider’s deviation from the appropriate standard of care. Basically, this means that a doctor, hospital, nurse, dentist or other type of health provider is only responsible if they did something, or failed to do something, which would generally be perceived as wrong within their specific area of practice. HAMSTEAD, WILLIAMS & SHOOK PLLC has access to knowledgeable doctors, nurse, dentists, hospital administrators and other healthcare experts who can explain whether a medical provider was at fault or not.\n6. WHAT HAPPENS IF I GET HURT BY A HIT AND RUN DRIVER?\nAll insurance policies issued in West Virginia carry mandatory coverage for personal injury and property loss caused by an uninsured motorist. This includes a hit and run driver. In order to collect on a claim involving a hit and run driver it is necessary that the police or other appropriate authority investigate promptly and that your insurance carrier be notified within sixty (60) days. The minimum uninsured limits which accompany every policy are inadequate for serious injuries. Uninsured motorist coverage is relatively inexpensive and most people would be wise to contact their insurance agent to learn what amount of coverage is right for them.\n7. WHAT CAN A WORKER DO IF HE OR SHE IS WRONGLY TERMINATED?\nGenerally, the law in West Virginia is that employment is “at will”. This means that in the absence of a written contract, an employee’s work is at the will and pleasure of the employer and the employee can be fired for any reason which does not violate a substantial public policy goal or a specific statute. Examples of state statutes which provide safeguards and remedies to wrongfully terminated employees are the West Virginia Human Rights Act, West Virginia Worker’s Compensation Statute, and the Whistle-blower Act (for public employees). This list is by no means inclusive. Rights and remedies are often very case specific so that prompt consultation with an attorney can ensure that your rights are protected if you have been dealt with wrongfully at work.\n8. WHAT DOES THE LAW PROVIDE FOR INJURIES OCCURRING ON REAL ESTATE?\nVisitors to a business or commercial establishment are owed the duty to have the premises made reasonably safe for the visit. If that duty is breached, and an injury results, then the injured person may be able to recover damages from either the property owner or the business occupant. Tenants who are injured because of unsafe conditions or toxic substances on the premises such as lead paint can also pursue a claim for their injury.\n9. WHAT HAPPENS IF THE DRUNK DRIVER WHO CAUSES INJURY DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH INSURANCE?\nThis is precisely the type of situation where either uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage can be helpful. In addition, the law deals with the issue of drunk driving so strictly that, in addition to the impaired driver, liability might also attach to a business which sells alcohol to an underage or intoxicated person, and even passengers who have contributed to their driver being impaired.\n10. CAN I SUE MY EMPLOYER IF I GET HURT ON THE JOB?\nGenerally, employers who subscribe to Workers Compensation, and their employees, are immune from suit and the only remedy is through Workers Compensation. There is an important exception, however, and that occurs where the employer deliberately injures a worker. Deliberate intent can be established by proving that there was a dangerous condition at work that the employer knew about which violated a safety standard, regulation or practice, yet the worker was nevertheless deliberately exposed to the hazard and suffered injury. The employer is entitled to a credit for all sums that the worker will receive from Workers Compensation. Still, pursuing this type of claim will generally result in more fair compensation than what Workers Compensation alone can provide.', 'What Lawyers Should Know About Personal Umbrella Insurance\nWhat Lawyers Should Know About Personal Umbrella Insurance\nBy James R. Harding, CPCU, CLU, CPA, Aon Insurance Services\nIn today’s litigious climate, personal umbrella liability insurance is quickly becoming a must-have for any professional. However, you may be surprised to learn there are thousands of attorneys who are well aware of the risks faced each day but do not carry any, or enough, coverage of this type.\nThe Need for Personal Umbrella\nThe majority of claims filed under umbrella policies are auto-related, and since virtually all of us drive, the need for an umbrella policy is fairly obvious. However, there may be many other risks and situations that can apply. Take a moment to review the “Risk Checklist” at the end of this article, and determine which, if any, of these situations may exist for you.\nIf you checked at least one, an umbrella policy should be seriously considered. If you checked more than one, thereby entailing more exposure to risk, this coverage should be viewed as “mandatory.”\nThe need for this coverage becomes apparent when you stop to consider your everyday activities and the risks you face. But you also need to be aware of what a personal umbrella policy offers, covers, and excludes. The knowledge of the coverage features, which can be hidden in the policy text or may arise as an exception to an exclusion in the policy, can be invaluable in making sure you are adequately covering your own exposures.\nKnow Some of the Fine Points and Definitions\nPersonal Injury. Personal injury exposure such as false arrest, libel, slander, and malicious prosecution is different from bodily injury and property damage, and are defined separately in liability policies. Certain homeowners coverage may only provide coverage for personal injury with the purchase of a separate endorsement for an additional premium charge. Personal injury coverage may not be automatic in the homeowners and the umbrella policy. To avoid having a gap in coverage or even worse -- no coverage -- you should ensure that personal injury protection is fully provided in both the homeowners and umbrella coverage. Be very careful on this point as some umbrella policies may be “follow form”, which means that if the occurrence is not covered in the homeowners coverage, then there is no coverage provided by the umbrella.\nDefense Coverage. In addition to the limit of provided coverage, the insurance company will provide at its own expense the counsel of its choice to defend an insured. The umbrella insurer may also join with a primary insurer providing underlying insurance in the investigation, defense, or settlement of any claim or suit. This provision enables the umbrella insurer to get involved early in any claim where there is a chance that the claim may escalate above the primary limits. This can provide additional legal support for an insured on a claim that may not reach into the umbrella limit. In addition to the limit of liability, the insurer will pay bond premiums, court costs, interest occurring between the judgment and payment date, reasonable expenses, and some amount for the loss of earnings on behalf of the insured.\nDirectors & Officers Liability. Personal umbrellas have an exclusion for Directors & Officers (D&O) liability. The policy is personal, and D&O exposures for financial type claims, including breach of fiduciary responsibility, are not covered. When you read the D&O exclusion in an umbrella policy, there is usually an exception to the exclusion where coverage is provided when an insured sits on a board or is an officer of a not-for-profit organization and does not receive any compensation. Coverage is available; however, it is limited to bodily injury, property damage, and personal injury as defined in the policy. The types of claims usually emerging from the D&O risk are financial type claims that would not be covered. The personal umbrella is not the complete solution for this risk. If you are going to be on a board or are an officer of a not-for-profit as a volunteer, it is important to make sure the entity has real Directors & Officers liability coverage and that you are personally covered.\nContract of Adhesion. When a question arises between an insured and the company whether coverage applies, remember that a personal umbrella contract is a “Contract of Adhesion”. This means it is usually considered a one-sided contract, favoring the party who drafted the document. Since it is prepared by the insurance company and accepted by the insured without any negotiation of the terms, any ambiguity will be construed in favor of the insured, and any exclusion from coverage must be clearly and conspicuously stated for it to have effect. However, it is better by far not to even get to this point, especially if a claim situation has arisen. It is always prudent to continually evaluate who, where, and what is covered as your risk profile changes. The definition of “who is insured”, especially with family members, can be significant with youthful automobile operators living at home or away at school.\nUninsured Motorists Coverage. Uninsured Motorists Coverage (UMC) is provided with primary auto insurance. This coverage is first-party protection providing coverage to the insured in the event of bodily injury from an automobile accident with someone who has no, or inadequate, liability insurance. Although the primary intent of the personal umbrella is to provide you with third-party liability protection, in certain states an offer must be made to an insured providing the option of purchasing a UMC limit at least equal to the umbrella limit. This option may be of value depending upon where a person drives and also taking into consideration any other coverage such as auto, medical, and disability that apply.\nEstate Settlements. During the insured’s lifetime, the policy cannot be assigned or transferred by the insured without the consent of the insurance company. However, at the death of an insured, a surviving spouse or other family members can request that the coverage be continued under their name. If the insurer does not permit the assignment, it will usually issue a new policy. This is an important focus to ensure that coverage continues. Upon death of an insured, the policy covers the deceased’s legal representative, such as an executor or administrator. The liability coverage that would have applied to the insured is extended to cover the legal representative acting on behalf of the insured. However, any actions of the legal representative unrelated to the insured’s personal affairs are not covered.\nPersonal Umbrella Liability Insurance\nIn closing, keep in mind these points:\nUmbrella policies are usually purchased from either the primary auto or homeowner insurance provider. This coverage, unlike other lines of personal insurance, is not actively sold or required by law. Additionally, most companies will only write the policy if the insured has one of the primary coverages. “Stand-Alone” umbrellas, which are issued by an insurer who has none of the primary coverages of the insured, are more difficult to obtain but should be considered for unique risks (or when the needs for higher limits make sense). With the start of a new year, today might be a good time to reevaluate your existing coverage, making certain that you have the right coverage to protect you, your income, and your assets.\nCan You Pass the Risk Checklist?\nThis article is intended to inform the reader of potential liability exposures for attorneys.

905	wildlife stand improvement techniques harmful effects glyphosate herbicides forest management	Wildlife Stand Improvement (WSI) techniques involve selective tree cutting to enhance wildlife habitat, but the use of glyphosate-based herbicides in forest management raises significant concerns. While WSI methods like hack and squirt involve applying herbicides to remove unwanted trees, glyphosate has been linked to serious health problems including cancer, neurological diseases, endocrine disruption, and birth defects. The herbicide can contaminate soil, air, groundwater, and surface waters, potentially affecting both wildlife and human health. When implementing WSI, alternative non-toxic methods should be considered given the widespread environmental persistence of glyphosate and its potential harmful effects on ecosystems.	['Forest landowners who are also hunters and want to manage their properties for wildlife have many options. One, commonly called TSI or “Timber Stand Improvement” in the forestry world, has a variation known as WSI or “Wildlife Stand Improvement.” The subtle, but big, difference is that the landowner’s goals are more focused on wildlife rather than maximum timber value.\nSometimes these objectives are similar; other times, they can be quite different. Wildlife improvement operations normally involve selecting trees for thinning and cull removal and release from surrounding trees. Timber stand conditions and landowner goals determine tree selection.\nJoe Boswell, a Virginia Department of Forestry senior area forester, evaluated one 38-acre Botetourt County, Virginia, property and offered suggestions for managing it better for wildlife. He noted the property had a variety of trees, including post oaks, northern red oaks, scarlet oaks, red maples, red cedars, dogwoods, plus one mockernut hickory and a sole sourwood tree. The stand also had several dead ash trees, victims of the insidious emerald ash borer.\nBoswell said the first thing to do was to carefully cut the ashes before they fell on other desirable trees. Next, he recommended removing the red cedars and red maples, noting that the latter, after they had been cut, would produce some fetching ground level browse for deer. Cutting these trees also would allow more sunlight to reach the remaining trees and the ground.\nOne recommendation was particularly tough to swallow. “Cut down some of those mast-bearing trees,” was the gist of it. Doing so would afford the remaining trees more access to sunlight and more room to grow, resulting in fuller canopies and higher production. With that knowledge, the landowner cut down several scarlet, northern red and post oaks, allowing nearby acorn producers to flourish thanks to the reduced competition.\nThe landowner spared a sourwood tree, as only half a half dozen or so of that species was resident on the entire property. Although sourwoods are not a major producer of food, they do provide a nectar source for honeybees, adding diversity to the property.\nIf leveling one tree might damage a tree designated as keeper, Travis Sumner, NWTF Hunting Heritage Center and habitat manager, suggests employing hack and squirt on the tree targeted for removal. This involves using a hatchet or similar tool and cutting through the bark into the tree’s cambium, then squirting an herbicide directly into the tree. Once defoliated and dead, that tree should be easier to remove, especially as limbs begin dropping off. Be careful to avoid any runoff of herbicide used in this treatment, as it can also injure or kill nearby trees.\nBefore firing up the chain saw, the NWTF urges land managers to consider several factors. First, have reasonable expectations. Determine your individual goals and set a realistic timetable. Forest management does not produce overnight results. Next, it is also a good idea to have an experienced set of eyes look over your land. Trained biologists or foresters from state wildlife and forestry departments and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service are possible sources. The NWTF’s national forest management initiative, developed in partnership with NRCS, may also offer assistance. Several foresters were recently hired and one of their key mission objectives is to assist landowners with developing management plans for their property. These experts can also advise about cost-share assistance programs that may be available for landowners conducting stand improvement and other conservation practices.\nWildlife stand improvement goes beyond improving conditions for mast-bearing trees. When it comes to turkeys, land managers can provide more nesting and brood cover by creating forest openings and edges, as well as early successional habitat. In many places, this type of cover doesn’t exist at all.', 'How to Avoid Toxic Roundup and Other Glyphosate-Based Herbicides That Are Poisoning Our Food, Soil, Air, Groundwater, Surface Waters, Rainwater\nQuestions swirl about the health effects of this common herbicide. We’ve got answers.\nby Autumn Spanne\nMarch 1, 2022\nSince it first went on the market in 1974, glyphosate has been used for weed control, as an exfoliant to eradicate unwanted vegetation and illegal crops, and as a crop desiccant—a chemical applied to crops to dry them out more quickly before harvest.\nWhat is glyphosate?\nAs a non-selective herbicide, it kills most plants. Scientists now link glyphosate to a number of human health problems, from cancer and neurological diseases to endocrine disruption and birth defects. But the full range of glyphosate’s health effects remains unknown.\nWhat is glyphosate used for?\nVarious formulations of glyphosate-based herbicides, like Monsanto’s Roundup, are used in agriculture and forestry. Since the mid-1990s, global use has risen dramatically, thanks to the introduction of genetically engineered “Roundup Ready” crops like corn, soybeans, cotton, and alfalfa that resist damage from the herbicide. Today, Roundup and other glyphosate-based herbicides are also frequently used on lawns, gardens, parks, and school grounds for weed control.\nWhere is glyphosate?\nGlyphosate not only enters our bodies when we come in direct contact with it, but when we breathe, eat, and drink.(Credit: summerbl4ck/flickr)\nThe widespread use of glyphosate makes it ubiquitous in the environment. Researchers have found it in our food, soil, air, groundwater, surface waters like lakes and rivers, and even in rainwater. That means glyphosate not only enters our bodies when we come in direct contact with it, but when we breathe, eat, and drink.\nAs worldwide use of glyphosate has increased during the past 25 years or so, human exposures to glyphosate-based herbicides have also risen significantly. A 2017 study found that human glyphosate exposure increased more than 500% in two decades.\nWhy is glyphosate a health concern?\nEmerging research suggest glyphosate could be associated with shorter pregnancies, which can be detrimental to maternal health and increase the risk of infant mortality and learning problems in children. (Credit: Anna Carolina Vieira Santos/flickr)\nRecent health studies are prompting calls for more scrutiny of glyphosate toxicity. Research now links glyphosate to health problems including cancer, reproductive problems, neurological diseases like ALS, endocrine disruption, and birth defects. Researchers are also beginning to explore potential impacts of glyphosate on pregnancy. Emerging findings suggest glyphosate could be associated with shorter pregnancies. Shorter pregnancies can be detrimental to maternal health and increase the risk of infant mortality and learning problems as children develop.\nIn 2015, the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen. However, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has long maintained that glyphosate poses no risk for human health when used according to the manufacturer’s instructions—a finding criticized by many scientists.\nWhile most health research on glyphosate to date focuses on cancer, there is much that science doesn’t yet know about its other potential impacts on human health. Much more research is needed to understand the full range of effects, how they may differ in children and adults, and the extent of glyphosate’s environmental impacts. Leading environmental health researchers, including EHN’s chief scientist Pete Myers, have called for more investigation and better monitoring of glyphosate in water, food, and human bodies.\nIn addition, scientists have raised concerns about the other ingredients in glyphosate-based herbicides. While glyphosate is the active ingredient, companies don’t have to publicly disclose other proprietary chemicals in these herbicide formulations. Consequently, regulators and researchers can’t fully study these “inert” chemicals to determine their health effects—alone and in combination with each other. Some scientists and activists want to reform the regulatory system so that companies can’t keep these chemicals secret.\nWhy are there so many glyphosate lawsuits right now?\nTens of thousands of lawsuits have been filed by people claiming that Roundup and other glyphosate-based herbicides caused their cancer. (Credit: Mike Mozart/flickr)\nThe World Health Organization’s 2015 declaration that glyphosate probably causes cancer opened the floodgates to litigation. The German company Bayer A.G. bought Monsanto in 2018, and tens of thousands of lawsuits have been filed against the company by people claiming that Roundup and other glyphosate-based herbicides caused their cancer, especially non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nMost claimants in these lawsuits worked in jobs like agriculture, maintenance, landscaping, and other professions with significant exposure risk, or used the products long-term on their lawns and gardens. They say the companies failed to adequately warn the public about health risks.\nIn 2021, Bayer announced it would replace glyphosate in all lawn and garden products sold in the United States by 2023. The company said the removal of glyphosate from these products is “exclusively to manage litigation risk and not because of any safety concerns,” and indicated it has no plans to remove glyphosate from professional and agricultural market products in the U.S.\nOne group that’s been largely excluded from glyphosate lawsuits is migrant farmworkers, who are on the front lines when it comes to glyphosate exposure. EHN found that fear of retaliation, and a lack of legal resources and legal immigration status, has diminished migrant farmworkers’ ability to seek justice and compensation.\nWhere is glyphosate used most?\nGlyphosate is the most used pesticide on agricultural crops in the U.S., according to a 2019 analysis by the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting. The Midwest, California, and Texas represent about three-quarters of agricultural glyphosate use in the U.S., with the Midwest alone comprising a full two-thirds of total use.\nGlyphosate’s popularity comes in part from the fact that it is effective and relatively cheap. Low-cost versions from China and other countries with relatively lax environmental and health regulations flooded the market as glyphosate patents expired in the 1990s, making it even cheaper. This helps explain why its use has increased so dramatically in the past two decades. But some local, state, and national governments are bucking that trend.\nWhere is glyphosate banned?\nGlyphosate has been or will soon be banned in at least 10 countries, including Mexico, Germany, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam, and at least 15 others have restricted its use, according to Human Rights Watch. Individual cities and counties, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Miami, Baltimore, Austin, and Portland, have taken action to restrict or ban glyphosate, as have some states.\nCan glyphosate exposure be avoided?\nChoosing organic foods is one way to limit glyphosate exposure. (Credit: Open Grid Scheduler / Grid Engine/flickr)\nUnfortunately, glyphosate is hard to avoid. We can’t stop breathing, eating, or drinking water.\nHowever, avoiding GMO foods and eating more organic foods when possible can help. Choosing non-toxic methods of weed control for your lawn and garden also limits exposure. Joining with others to ban glyphosate-based products (and other pesticides) in schools, parks, and your community at large are other effective ways to reduce local exposures.\nWays to take action on glyphosate\nFarmers from the Ecuador-Colombia border region voice concerns about economic and health impacts of aerial glyphosate spraying.

Residential care allows for a focus on treatment in a safe place, while also giving patients tools needed to succeed once out of care. Schizophrenia treatment includes medication, therapy, social and family support, and the use of social services. Treatment must be ongoing, as this is a chronic illness without a cure. When schizophrenia is treated and managed over the long-term, most people can live normal, productive, and fulfilling lives.\nSchizophrenia is a serious mental illness, and it has no known cure. However, this condition is treatable. While it was once thought to be a disease that only worsened over time, schizophrenia is now known to be manageable thanks to modern treatment practices.\nWith a dedication to ongoing treatment, often beginning with intensive residential care, most individuals can live normal or almost-normal lives. Most patients will get better but still have occasional episodes, but about 20 percent will recover within five years.\nAs a psychotic condition, schizophrenia can cause some very troubling symptoms, like hallucinations and delusions, that make daily life challenging. Without treatment it can lead to isolation, an inability to work or go to school, depression, suicide, and other complications.\nA multi-faceted treatment approach that changes with each patient’s needs is essential to helping people diagnosed with schizophrenia live normal lives.\nSchizophrenia Symptoms and Diagnosis\nIt is not possible to live a normal life if schizophrenic symptoms go ignored, undiagnosed, and untreated. The signs of schizophrenia include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thoughts, confusing speech, unusual behaviors and movements, agitation or aggression, flat or inappropriate emotional affect, and in some cases catatonia or extreme lethargy.\nIt is crucial to be evaluated if any of these signs develop. A mental health professional can use a medical examination, medical history, observations, and interviewing to determine if a person’s symptoms are caused by schizophrenia or another condition. It is only with this accurate diagnosis that a patient can then get the treatment necessary to manage symptoms and go back to enjoying a more normal life.\nSchizophrenia Management is Possible\nLiving a normal life with schizophrenia doesn’t necessarily mean never having symptoms again—it means being able to manage this chronic illness in order to live independently, or mostly independently, and do all the things other adults do, such as work and have families. The key to managing and living well with this condition is treatment. With good and ongoing treatment it is possible to live an enjoyable and fulfilling life. Most people improve with treatment, although recurrences are possible. There are certain factors that make some people more likely to see the best improvement in function, such as:\n- Functioning well before the onset of schizophrenia\n- Being older when the symptoms first began\n- Not having a family history of schizophrenia\n- Having symptoms begin suddenly, rather than beginning slowly\n- Having a higher IQ\nWhile these factors seem to contribute to greater success in recovery from schizophrenia, anyone with this condition can improve and live normally with good treatment.\nThe Importance of Residential Treatment for Schizophrenia\nSymptoms of schizophrenia can be very troubling and disruptive. They can also be severe and cause significant impairment in a person’s life. In some cases an episode of symptoms may even be severe enough to require temporary hospitalization. For anyone diagnosed with this mental health condition, residential treatment is strongly recommended.\nResidential care gives patients the opportunity to focus on and engage with treatment without worrying about home, family, work, and other responsibilities. Inpatient care is also more intensive and helps patients jump-start recovery, guiding them through strategies and exercises that will help them manage their illness once back at home. Treatment in a residential facility gives patients all the tools they need to be successful once they leave, while also providing a safe environment in which to go through therapy.\nMedication to Manage Symptoms\nThe most important part of treatment for schizophrenia is medication. It is nearly impossible to manage symptoms without antipsychotic drugs. There are two classes of antipsychotics: first generation and second generation. It may take a few attempts with different medications from either class to find one that works best for a patient, which means providing the best symptom relief with the fewest side effects. Patients may also benefit from anti-anxiety medications or antidepressants if they also struggle with other mental illnesses.\nTherapy to Make Positive Changes\nMedication is so important to managing schizophrenia, but therapy is also crucial for learning to live with this disease. Behavioral therapies, for instance, can help patients learn how to recognize symptoms and signs of an episode, while also taking positive steps to change negative thoughts and behaviors that are under a person’s control. This kind of therapy also gives patients action-oriented strategies and tools for managing stress, for coping with challenges in healthy ways, and for setting and meeting goals.\nOther types of therapy can supplement behavioral therapies or may work better for certain individuals. Alternative and creative therapies are often offered in residential treatment centers, and can be useful for exploring emotions and finding positive ways to cope. These include music and art therapy, drama therapy, animal therapies, and even massage therapy for relaxation and stress.\nSocial and Family Support\nMedication and therapy are the traditional and necessary elements of treatment for schizophrenia, but support cannot be overlooked for helping patients live with this illness. Support can come from family, friends, therapists, and other people living with schizophrenia. Group therapy and support groups, for instance, can be helpful by providing an outlet for sharing difficult emotions and experiences and for relying on others who understand what it means to have this illness.\nFamily support, when possible, is also very helpful for people trying to live well with schizophrenia. Family can provide practical support, such as housing and money. They can also provide love, comfort, and guidance. Family should get involved with treatment when possible, for instance going through family psychoeducation. This kind of programming teaches family members about schizophrenia and how to support someone living with it.\nVocational and Social Services\nWhile treatment and support can help successfully manage symptoms of schizophrenia, patients still may be left with deficits in function. For instance, they may struggle with holding down a job or finding housing and managing money. To really live an independent and normal life with schizophrenia requires a range of services and assistance. Vocational training can help someone get and keep a job, while housing services can help find a recovering patient an affordable place to live. Other services may include transportation, academic support, or social groups.\nSelf-Care and Management at Home\nOnce treatment ends in a residential setting and patients are set up with social services and sources of social support, self-care becomes important. A good treatment plan should teach patients strategies and tools for self-care and for managing their illness once back at home. This may mean taking advantage of socializing opportunities whenever possible, but also more specific strategies, including:\n- Managing stress with relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or meditation\n- Getting regular exercise\n- Eating nutritious foods and maintaining a healthy weight\n- Getting enough sleep\n- Maintaining good overall physical health\n- Avoiding drugs and alcohol\n- Getting treatment for and managing any other mental illnesses, like depression\n- Asking for help when needed\nSchizophrenia Treatment Doesn't Have to Be Scary\nWe're Here to Help\nOngoing, Lifelong Treatment\nOne of the most important things that people with schizophrenia must understand about living a normal life is that this is a lifelong disease. It requires ongoing treatment and management. There are likely to be recurrences of symptoms, as with any chronic illness, but ongoing care can help individuals cope successfully with these episodes.\nOngoing treatment does not have to be as intensive as the initial treatment an individual gets for schizophrenia. It can be a weekly therapy session, continuing use of medications, and even occasional overnight or extended stays in treatment facilities as needed. Continuing with self-care and always seeking positive support are also essential to long-term management of schizophrenia.\nIt is possible and even likely for someone with schizophrenia to live a normal life if there is a commitment to treatment. There is a small percentage of people who will continue to struggle with symptoms and to live independently, but most patients who go through treatment, find the right medications, continue with ongoing therapy and support, and practice good self-care and management will recover sufficiently to live normally and well.""]"	['<urn:uuid:dc94be8b-b8d3-4d23-8303-51a34037677f>', '<urn:uuid:4da0bb31-ad16-409a-bd9a-3097643075a7>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-02T11:30:12.866257	10	68	2086
528	birth problems early pregnancy brain spinal cord chiari malformation spina bifida risk factors differ	Spina bifida has several known risk factors including race (more common in whites and Hispanics), family history, folate deficiency, certain medications (like valproic acid), diabetes, obesity, and increased body temperature during early pregnancy. For Chiari malformation type I, the exact cause of the congenital form is not known, but it may be caused by problems during fetal growth, exposure to harmful substances during pregnancy, or genetic factors. Unlike spina bifida, the documents don't mention specific risk factors like race, obesity, or folate deficiency for Chiari malformation.	"['Spina bifida or Cleft Spine\nSpina bifida is a birth defect that involves the incomplete development of the spinal cord or its coverings. The term spina bifida means “split” or “open” spine. Spina bifida is part of a group of birth defects called neural tube defects. The neural tube is the embryonic structure that eventually develops into the baby’s brain and spinal cord and the tissues that enclose them. Most children who have spina bifida do not have problems from it\nSpina bifida occurs at the end of the first month of pregnancy when the two sides of the embryo’s spine fail to join together, leaving an open area. In some cases, the spinal cord or other membranes may push through this opening in the back. The condition usually is detected before a baby is born and treated right away. Other neural tube defects include amencephaly, a condition in which the portion of the neural tube which will become the cerebrum does not close, and encephalocele, which results when other parts of the brain remain unfused.\nWhat causes spina bifida\nThe exact cause of this birth defect is not known. Genes and environment factors are said to be the most important cause women who have had one child with spina bifida are more likely to have another child with the disease environmental factors, such as nutrition and exposure to harmful substances, probably contribute to spina bifida. Spina bifida does seem to run in families, spina bifida can be prevented by adequate intake of folic acid. Folic acid, one of the B vitamins that is a key factor in the synthesis (the making) of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA). before and during early pregnancy people with spina bifida appear to have abnormal metabolism of folic acid. spina bifida may be an inborn defect in folic acid metabolism rather than a simple deficiency in this nutrient. A high fever during pregnancy may increase a woman’s chances of having a baby with spina bifida. Women with epilepsy who have taken the drug valproic acid to control seizures may have an increased risk of having a baby with spina bifida.\nTypes of spina bifida\nThe different types of spina bifida are—-\n1) spina bifida occulta\n2) spina bifida cystica\nspina bifida occulta\n“occulta means hidden, defect is not visible or without symptoms. This is the mildest forms of spina bifida. In occulta, the outer part of some of the vertebrae are not completely closed. The split in the vertebrae is so small that the spinal cord does not protrude. The skin at the site of the lesion may be normal, or it may have some hair growing from it; there may be a dimple in the skin, or a birthmark Most children with this type of defect never have any health problems, and the spinal cord is often unaffected. Spina bifida occulta is rarely linked with complications or symptoms. Spina bifida occulta is usually discovered accidentally when the person has an x-ray or MRI for some other reason\nSpina bifida cystica\nIn spina bifida cystica, a cyst protrudes through the defect in the vertebral arch. spina bifida cystica may result in hydrocephalus and neurological deficits\nThe least common form of spina bifida is a posterior meningocele (or meningeal cyst involves the meninges, the membranes responsible for covering and protecting the brain and spinal cord. If the meninges push through the hole in the vertebrae (the small, ring-like bones that make up the spinal column), the sac is called a meningocele Fluid leaks out of the spine and pushes against the skin. You may see a bulge in the skin. In many cases, there are no other symptoms..In a posterior meningocele, the vertebrae develop normally, however the meninges are forced into the gaps between the vertebrae. As the nervous system remains undamaged, individuals with meningocele are unlikely to suffer long-term health problems, Symptoms can vary from none to partial paralysis, but these cysts can sometimes be removed with surgery, allowing the child to develop normally.\nis the most severe form of spina bifida. It occurs when the meninges push through the hole in the back, and the spinal cord also pushes though. Most babies who are born with this type of spina bifida also have hydrocephalus, an accumulation of fluid in and around the brain. ecause of the abnormal development of and damage to the spinal cord, a child with myelomeningocele typically has some paralysis. The degree of paralysis largely depends on where the opening occurs in the spine. The higher the opening is on the back, the more severe the paralysis tends to be. Part of the spinal nerves push out of the spinal canal, and you may see a bulge in the skin. The nerves are often damaged, which can cause problems with walking, bladder or bowel control, and coordination. In some babies, the skin is o pen and the nerves are exposed . this is the type of spina bifida that causes the vast majority of disability. The exposure of these nerves and tissues make the baby more prone to life-threatening infections. Many individuals with spina bifida will have an associated abnormality of the cerebellum, called the Arnold Chiari II malformation In affected individuals the back portion of the brain is displaced from the back of the skull down into the upper neck.\nRisk factors of spina bifida\n- Race. Spina bifida is more common among whites and Hispanics.\n- Family history of neural tube defects. Couples who’ve had one child with a neural tube defect have a slightly higher chance of having another baby with the same defect\nFolate deficiency. Folate (vitamin B-9) is important to the healthy development of a fetus. Folate is the natural form of vitamin B-9. The synthetic form, found in supplements and fortified foods, is called folic acid. A folate deficiency increases the risk of spina bifida and other neural tube defects\n- Some medications. Anti-seizure medications, such as valproic acid (Depakene), seem to cause neural tube defects when taken during pregnancy, perhaps because they interfere with the body’s ability to use folate and folic acid.\n- Diabetes. Women with diabetes who don’t control their blood sugar well have a higher risk of having a baby with spina bifida.\n- Obesity. Pre-pregnancy obesity is associated with an increased risk of neural tube birth defects, including spina bifida.\n- Increased body temperature. Some evidence suggests that increased body temperature (hyperthermia) in the early months of pregnancy may increase the risk of spina bifida.\nSigns and symptoms of spina bifida\nchild’s symptoms will depend on how severe the defect is.\nSpina bifida occurs in three forms, each varying in severity:\nSpina bifida occulta. This mildest form results in a small separation or gap in one or more of the bones (vertebrae) of the spine. Because the spinal nerves usually aren’t involved, most children with this form of spina bifida have no signs or symptoms and experience no neurological problems. An abnormal tuft of hair, a collection of fat, a small dimple o a birthmark on the newborn’s skin above the spinal defect may be the only visible indication of t he condition.\nMeningocele. In this rare form, the protective membranes around the spinal cord (meninges) push out through the opening in the vertebrae. abies who are born with the meningocele form have a fluid-filled sac visible on the back. The sac is often covered by a thin layer of skin and can be as small as a grape or as large as a grapefruit.\nMyelomeningocele n myelomeningocele, the baby’s spinal canal remains open along several vertebrae in the lower or middle back. Because of this opening, both the membranes and the spinal cord protrude at birth, forming a sac on the baby’s back. In some cases, skin covers the sac. Usually, however, tissues and nerves are exposed, making the baby prone to life-threatening infections.\nNeurological impairment — often including loss of movement (paralysis) — is common. So are bowel and bladder problems, seizures and other medical complications. Many children who have severe spina bifida develop an allergy to latex (a type of rubber) Spine, hip, foot, and leg deformities are often due to imbalances in The most common bladder and bowel problems are inability to voluntarily relax the muscles (sphincters) that hold urine in the bladder and muscle strength and function resulting mostly from residual paralysis . there is foot or leg deformities, hip dislocation, or scoliosis.\nDiagnosis of spina bifida\nPregnant woman can have a blood test (maternal serum triple or quadruple screen) and a fetal ultrasound to check for spina bifida and other problems with the fetus.\nIf test results suggest a birth defect, she can choose to have an amniocentesis. This test helps confirm if spina bifida exists. But the test also has risks, such as a chance of miscarriage.\nTreatment of spina bifida\nTreatment depends on how severe the defect is. Most children with spina bifida have only a mild defect and may not need treatment. But a child with a severe defect may need surgery. If child has problems from nerve damage, he or she may need a brace or a wheelchair, physical therapy, or other aids. If y child has bladder control problems, he can use a catheter each day. It can help prevent infection and kidney damage in the child , child has little or no feeling in the limbs and can’t sense pain, he or she may get injured and not know it. the need is to check the child’s skin each day for cuts, bruises, or other sores. A baby who also has hydrocephalus will need an operation to place a shunt in the brain. The shunt is a thin tube that helps to relieve pressure on the brain by draining and diverting extra fluid. Most affected individuals will need to use braces, crutches walkers or wheelchairs to maximize their mobility', ""What is a Chiari malformation?\nA Chiari malformation is a problem in which a part of the brain at the rear of the skull bulges through a normal opening (foramen magnum) in the skull where it joins the spinal canal. This puts pressure on parts of the brain and spinal cord, and can cause mild to severe symptoms. In most cases, the problem is present at birth (congenital).\nThere are several types of Chiari malformations, but type I (CM-I) is the most common type. In type I, part of the cerebellum bulges through the foramen magnum. This type is most often congenital (also called primary CM-I), but is often not found until a child is a teen or young adult. In rare cases, this type may also develop later in life. This is known as acquired or secondary CM-I.\nWhat causes a Chiari malformation type I?\nThe exact cause of a congenital Chiari malformation type I is not known. A problem during fetal growth may cause the defect. It may be caused by contact with harmful substances during pregnancy. Or it may be linked with genetic problems that run in families.\nAn acquired Chiari malformation type I happens to a person after birth. It is caused by excess leaking of spinal fluid from the lower back (lumbar) or chest (thoracic) areas of the spine. This can happen because of an injury, contact with harmful substances, or an infection.\nWhat are the symptoms of a Chiari malformation type I?\nYour child may not have any symptoms. Or symptoms may develop slowly over time. Most children don't have symptoms until they are teens or young adults.\nThe most common symptoms are headaches or pain in the back of the head or neck. The headaches and pain are made worse by coughing, laughing, or sneezing.\nYour child may also have other symptoms of a Chiari malformation type I, such as:\nHoarseness or trouble speaking\nRapid, back and forth eye movements (nystagmus)\nPeriods of not breathing during sleep (sleep apnea)\nWeakness or abnormal movements\nTrouble with balance\nAbnormal shape of the spine (scoliosis)\nYour child may also have a pocket of fluid in the spinal cord or brain stem. This is called a syrinx. A syrinx can cause trouble walking or pain in the arms or legs.\nHow is a Chiari malformation type I diagnosed?\nIn a child with no symptoms, the defect may be found when imaging tests are done for other reasons. For a child with symptoms, the health care provider will ask about your child's medical history and give your child a physical exam. He or she may refer your child to a specialist.\nImaging tests are done to detect a Chiari malformation type I. Your child may have 1 or more of these tests:\nMRI. This test is the one most often used to diagnose Chiari malformations. It uses large magnets and a computer to make detailed pictures of the inside of the body.\nCT scan. This test uses a series of X-rays and a computer to create detailed pictures of the inside of the body. A CT scan is more detailed than a regular X-ray.\nHow is a Chiari malformation type I treated?\nYour child may be treated by neurologists and neurosurgeons. These are experts in brain and spinal cord problems. Treatment will depend on your child’s symptoms, age, and general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is.\nWith no symptoms. Your child’s health may be watched closely. This may include frequent physical exams and MRI tests.\nWith symptoms. Your child's health care provider may prescribe medicines to reduce pain. Or he or she may advise decompression surgery. This is done to relieve pressure on the brain, or to restore the flow of spinal fluid.\nWith few or no symptoms, but a syrinx. Your child's health care provider may suggest close monitoring of the defect with a special type of MRI called cine phase contrast. This helps look for blocked spinal fluid flow. Your child may need surgery, based on the MRI results or if symptoms get worse.\nWith signs of sleep apnea. Your child may need a sleep study. In this test, your child will be monitored during sleep to look for problems. A sleep study can also help the health care provider decide on additional treatment.\nWhat are the complications of a Chiari malformation type I?\nComplications of a Chiari malformation type I can include:\nDevelopment of syrinx\nPermanent damage to muscles or nerves\nCarefully watching for changes in your child’s health can help prevent complications. This helps to make sure that treatment is done early.\nHow is a Chiari malformation type I managed?\nIt is hard for health care providers to predict how a Chiari malformation type I will affect a child’s long-term health. Your child may not have any changes caused by the defect. Or he or she may have worsening neurological problems. Your child’s health will be closely watched. This will include with frequent physical exams and imaging tests such as MRI. There is ongoing research as to how to best manage Chiari malformations.\nWhen should I call my child's health care provider?\nCall your child's health care provider if you notice any changes in your child. Be sure to call if you notice problems with:\nWalking or moving\nKey points about Chiari malformation type I\nWith a Chiari malformation, the lower part of the brain dips down through a normal opening at the bottom of the skull. In some cases, more brain tissue also dips down through this opening.\nIn most cases, the problem is present at birth (congenital).\nThere are several types of Chiari malformations. Type I is the most common type.\nYour child may not have symptoms. If symptoms occur, the most common ones are headaches or pain in the back of the head or neck. The headaches and pain are made worse by coughing, laughing, or sneezing.\nYour child may also have a pocket of fluid in the spinal cord or brain stem. This is called a syrinx.\nImaging tests are done to detect a Chiari malformation type I. Your child may have an MRI or a CT scan.""]"	['<urn:uuid:9cf4905e-bf14-4649-86f5-ead7af9b9697>', '<urn:uuid:ea61f1f2-749f-4232-aa5a-b62f58c5015b>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-01T22:05:01.292488	14	86	2685
1203	In my role developing parent engagement strategies, I'm trying to identify effective ways parents can support their children's learning process. What specific actions can parents take to boost their child's academic achievement?	Research shows that increased parent involvement leads to higher student achievement. Parents can support their children's learning by: making reading an everyday habit at home, communicating with their child's teacher, monitoring and assisting with homework assignments, asking for regular monitoring reports, sharing their child's successes, learning more about the curriculums and interventions being used in their child's school, and attending parent/teacher conferences and other school meetings about their child.	['Brocton Central School RTI\nDistrict Policy Regarding Response to Intervention (RTI) Process\n3 Tier Model for Grades K-12\nThe Brocton Central School District has a 3 Tier Response to Intervention (RtI) process in place.\nWhat is RtI?\nRtI is a multi-step process of providing educational support and instruction to children who are struggling learners. Individual children’s progress is monitored and results are used to make decisions about further instruction and intervention. RtI is most commonly used in addressing problems with reading and math but it can also be used in other areas. The RtI process is flexible and designed by school districts to meet the needs of their students.\nWhat does the RtI process look like?\nThe RtI process has three tiers. Each tier provides differing levels of support.\n- In Tier I, all students receive high quality curriculum and instruction in the general education classroom. The teacher uses differentiated instruction to assist all learners.\n- In Tier II, the school provides interventions via AIS Services to students who need more support than they are receiving from the general curriculum.\n- In Tier III, students are given intensive instruction within a small group setting (no more than three students).\nWhat are the key components to any RtI process?\nThe key component to any RtI process is all children receive high quality curriculum and instruction in the regular education classroom (Tier I). Another component of any RtI process is that the school conducts universal screenings. Universal screenings review the progress of all students through state and district test scores or other academic screenings given to all students. Universal screenings help schools identify students who may need more support or other types of instruction. As a result of universal screening, students may be identified as needing targeted assistance (a Tier II level of support) in addition to the high quality instruction they are receiving in Tier I. Research based interventions are used to support students in the area they are struggling. Research based interventions are teaching strategies or methods that have been proven to be effective in helping children learn. There are many different kinds of interventions and instruction that can happen in the classroom, outside the classroom or in small groups.\nAnother key component to the RtI process is progress monitoring. Progress monitoring is a way for teachers to take a snapshot of how children are doing on a specific skill. It shows how well the intervention is working. It includes observations, tests, and other formal and informal assessments. Progress monitoring helps determine whether an intervention is successful or needs to be changed. Formal guidelines for progress monitoring have been developed by the Brocton Central School District. The RtI plan will be available on the school website or in the elementary and middle/high school offices. Plans will detail how long a child will receive a particular intervention and how they will determine whether the intervention is helping the child. When the child meets the goals developed by the school, the intervention is no longer needed and the child continues to receive support from the general education curriculum. When progress monitoring shows that a child is not responding to the intervention another approach or intervention may be tried. However, when a higher level of support is needed, children are given intensive instruction, within in a small group setting, which further focuses on the supporting the skills they need to be successful learners (Tier III).\nWhat questions can parents ask to learn more about how RtI works in their child’s school?\n- What curriculum is being taught in my child’s classroom?\n- What are the targeted interventions that my child’s school is using if he/she is struggling in the classroom?\n- What are the formal guidelines my child’s school is using for progress monitoring?\n- How will I be informed of the progress my child is making?\n- What happens if an intervention is not working?\nParents play a critical role in supporting what their children are learning in school. Research shows that the more parents are involved in student learning, the higher the student achievement.\nThere are many ways parents can support what their child is doing in school. Here are a few:\n- Make reading an everyday habit at home\n- Communicate with your child’s teacher\n- Monitor and assist with homework assignments\n- Ask for regular monitoring reports\n- Share your child’s successes\n- Learn more about the curriculums and interventions being used in your child’s school\n- Attend parent/teacher conferences and other school meetings about your child']	['<urn:uuid:f1e4b7f6-aa4c-437a-b5ba-e3998a62231a>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-02T11:30:12.866257	32	69	758
468	How does Tim Kloss contribute to the development of poetry at the weekly gatherings at Linneman's?	Tim Kloss organizes weekly open mics at Linneman's with featured readers. He actively looks for new voices to schedule as featured readers, welcomes everyone with his greeting and smile, provides insightful comments on poems, and performs poetry himself, including a memorable rendition of Walt Whitman's 'Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking'.	['Margaret Rozga is the newly appointed Poet Laureate of Wisconsin. Rozga, a poet, civil rights activist, professor emerita at UW-Waukesha and a regular contributor to the NNS Community Voices column, writes about the Milwaukee poetry community that inspires her.\nI begin my term as Wisconsin Poet Laureate energized. I found that energy where I often do, at a Milwaukee poetry venue. I’d been to three of them recently. Woodland Pattern, Linneman’s, and the Jazz Gallery, all in Riverwest, are among key gathering spots where Milwaukee’s vibrant poetry community thrives. The creativity that happens when people gather at these venues pulls me in and helps me wake up ready for the day’s writing, meetings, phone calls and errands.\nBefore heading out to an evening poetry event, I sometimes hesitate. Not tonight, I tell myself, not this late, not in this rain or this cold, not by myself when I may not know anyone there. Then my need to hear empowering words overcomes the alternative: yet another newscast about undermining fair elections and civil rights, and about building walls of one kind or another. I’m of the mind of the Robert Frost poem that begins, “Something there is that doesn’t love a wall.” The arts offer a way not to ignore these issues, but to address the positive, to build the inclusive community we need.\nLast week, feeling the need for an inclusive community and affirming words, I headed to Riverwest’s Jazz Gallery. The MC at the PENtastic open mic, hosted by Still Waters Collective, was starting the evening program as I walked in. From her position on stage, she greeted me, “Hello there. So glad you came.” I’m not sure I knew her, but that didn’t matter. Everyone was welcome.\nBefore the reading began, she had us write on this question: “What is Black?” Everyone, black and non-black, set to work. Several eager volunteers then read their drafts, including black and white poets from Milwaukee and one from Racine. During the first set of the open mic, readers included spoken word artists and poets who read from their books or cell phones. At the break, we were told to get to know someone new. I found that two young women sitting near me were from Sheboygan and came after seeing news of this event on Facebook. They said they didn’t know of any poetry events in Sheboygan, so I gave them the name of a poet friend who organizes poetry events there. “Friend her on Facebook,” I said. I’ll tell her to expect to hear from you.”\nThis particular evening serves as a model of how we create community. Welcome everyone. Assume that everyone has creative potential. Create space where that potential can find room to stand up and be heard. Welcome different styles. Create a positive tone, even as we speak to perplexing and distressing issues.\nA similar model can be found Monday nights at Linneman’s. Tim Kloss organizes these weekly open mics with a featured reader. He lives and breathes poetry and the visual arts — drawing, painting. Always on the lookout for new voices, he schedules them in as featured readers. Everyone is welcome, and all are warmed by his greeting, his smile, and his insightful comments on the poems. His own annual turn as the featured reader is not to be missed. His performance of Walt Whitman’s “Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking” brought that poem to life and awed the audience. It would make a fan out of even the person most reluctant to engage with poetry.\nWoodland Pattern Book Center brings national poets to town for readings and workshops and celebrates Milwaukee poets. The center opens its doors to events like the launch of the poetry chapbook anthology “Where I Want to Live: Poems for Fair and Affordable Housing,” a project of the March On Milwaukee 50th anniversary planning committee. Black, brown, and white poets, gay and straight poets, middle school, high school, and poets of all ages, including some in their 70s participated. The event was not only about imagining an inclusive Milwaukee, but it also stood as an evening when that reality was palpable.\nOn Saturday afternoon, Jan. 26, Woodland Pattern will serve as the venue for the official passing of the Wisconsin’s Poet Laureate’s torch from Karla Huston to me. How very appropriate this setting will be.\nI studied poetry in college and graduate school. I know iambic pentameter and anaphora, lineation and prose poetry as concepts. What I learned in school provides a solid base for the work I’ll do as Wisconsin Poet Laureate, promoting poetry throughout Wisconsin. What I learned as a practicing poet adds depth. What I learned as a participant in Milwaukee’s poetry community will help bring it all to life.']	['<urn:uuid:83a4a19c-0b44-4af9-ada0-6ad52de4fea9>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-01T22:47:46.423955	16	51	793

1330	As a manufacturing consultant, I'm interested in understanding what makes China a good option for manufacturing, and how indoor vertical farming technologies might address some of the production challenges there. Can you explain both aspects?	China is optimal for manufacturing when you have products requiring high volume production (over 100,000 units) without much customization. They're also excellent for providing cheap components and subsystems that can be used in prototypes. However, for indoor vertical farming technologies, the production approach is completely different - using automated, climate-controlled environments that can be located anywhere in the world, achieving 350 times more productivity per square meter than outdoor farming, while using 95% less water through hydroponic systems.	"['Over the last 2 decades there has been a great rush to move manufacturing out of the US and into Mexico then China. The reason was simple, the cost for labor was vastly lower and this translated into much lower product costs.\nWith the explosion of the Internet of Things and the large number of new products being designed for this market, I was recently asked “who should I talk to in China to help me with prototyping my new product?”\nI’ve never had a particularly good experience with low volume production in China so I reached out to a few design houses and asked them for their input.\nWhat I got was a pretty consistent response. If you have a product that doesn’t require a lot of customization or tweaking and you have volume over 100,000, China is a great place to manufacture.\nBut when it came to prototyping in China? Fuggedaboudit! There were some issues that were brought up consistently:\nIssues with Prototyping in China\nWhile not all firms in China will steal your designs and sell them, many large companies have had issues with this. Probably the most well publicized in the wireless world is the battle between Cisco and Huawei where it was claimed that Huawei stole source code, showing up in Huawei products with the original Cisco comments still intact.\nWe’ve also seen this with “open sourced” maker products as well like the introduction of the Banana Pi, a Raspberry Pi, clone made in China without Broadcom’s proprietary chips. Beyond these issues, the Internet is rife with tales of IP infringement issues coming out of China.\nYour prototyping stage is the time period when you are most vulnerable. If your supplier (or a worker there) decides to take your concept, modify it slightly and roll it out in Asia, what are you as a start-up going to do about it? Go to court?\nThe Office of the US Trade Representative’s 2016 Report to Congress on China’s WTO Compliance concluded: “Despite ongoing revisions of laws and regulations relating to intellectual property rights, and greater emphasis on rule of law and enforcement campaigns in China, key weaknesses remain in China’s protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights, particularly in the area of trade secret misappropriation. Intellectual property rights holders face not only a complex and uncertain enforcement environment, but also pressure to transfer intellectual property rights to enterprises in China through a number of government policies and practices.”\nPenny Pritzker, former US secretary of commerce said it more directly, “the real conversation needs to be not just about the laws on the books but also about the court system and the broad and consistent application of these rules”.\nOf course US suppliers can also steal your ideas, but your chances of getting restitution are much greater in the US courts under the US rule of law.\nLanguage Barriers and Time Difference Issues\nRod Landers from the design house, Lab 651 said “The first time you are going to screw something up. You need people who can help you figure out what went wrong”.\nSometimes the issue is the design, sometimes the issue is workmanship. Resolving these issues quickly and with solid solutions in the prototype stage is a critical step in long-term product viability.\nChasing these issues takes time and the language barrier and the time zone differences can complicate this. While many Chinese firms have English language speakers, they may not be native language speakers and they may not be technical. Something always seems to get lost in the translation.\nTaiwan can be a bit better, because they tend to have more native English speakers, but the time zone issues are still a factor. For West Coast developers, Shenzhen is 11 hours ahead which means one party is either getting up early or staying late. This isn’t always easy to arrange with large groups and isn’t practical for daily interactions.\nPrototyping Resources in the US\nOk so you’ve decided to prototype in the US, not China. But who should you turn to for help?\nBig Design Shops\nThere are a few ways to go. One way is to hire a design firm to help you through the process. There are the big guys like Ideo and Frog (now Aricent), which are great firms to work with if your budget exceeds a million dollars.\nIf you don’t know their work or their processes, you should. They have helped companies design and produce some of the most memorable and useful products out there.\nBoutique Design guys\nFor those with more modest budgets, it might be better to consider hiring a boutique design shop. My go-to-guy for all things hardware and wireless is Rod Landers and Lab 651, but there are many other boutique firms out there. Do a search for firms in your area as a start. I like using local firms because of the close working relationship required to work through the inevitable issues discussed earlier.\nForget the Skype calls to china, just head over to your local firm and hunker down in the conference room, around CAD stations, or on an engineering bench and work through the issues.\nThe idea is great in concept; get your manufacturer to help you design your product. The positive is that they’ll know how to make it cost effectively and efficiently. The negative is that you’re now captive to that firm. It also seems to beg the question; if you’re good at mass production, can you also be good at prototyping?\nOne of the better-known contract manufacturers out there is Flex (formerly Flextronics). Flex is one of the bigger US manufacturers, though they have facilities all over the world, as you would expect from a $26 billion dollar company.\nThey’ve also recently moved headquarters to Singapore and are now pushing a “Sketch to Scale” program that purports to take companies from design to production with their internal resources and even help with logistics when you’re ready to ship. They even have a venture arm to help fund innovative ideas called Lab IX.\nWhile I love this company and their concept, I’m a bit nervous about the scale required to work with them. I know one startup company that has gone through their process and their CTO told me “We got there, and the final product was great, but it just about killed us getting there.” So make sure that you’re properly resourced (staff and money) for the process.\nMuch like partnering with your manufacturer, why not partner with your electronics supplier?\nArrow is more than just a distributor of components, they’re a global $23B technology company with thousands of engineers, who can provide online design tools, warehousing and distribution services, as well as marketing and supply chain expertise.\nThey’ve teamed up with Indiegogo, the crowd sourced funding platform, to help early stage companies, not only design their product, but also efficiently bring it to market. The Arrow certification badge on an Indiegogo campaign help companies raise more money and gives them access to funding from Arrow’s Flash Funding program. More info here: https://www.arrow.com/en/indiegogo\nYour Arrow rep is also a great resource for finding you local design and manufacturing resources. Chances are that they’re already working with, and have an opinion on these resources.\nDigikey is another great resource for domestic prototyping. While they’re best known for their catalog, and great online shop, they have a web site dedicated to the entire process of bringing your product to market called Maker.io. This site is filled with useful resources to help you take your product from “maker to market”. This is a must visit site.\nIf you already have your in house design team, have laid everything out, and just want a prototype built, try Screaming Circuits.\nScreaming Circuits, based in Oregon, was created in 2003 to reinvent electronics manufacturing. Unlike old-fashioned manufacturing models that focused on mass volumes and cost-control through rigidity, Screaming Circuits specializes in fast and flexible prototype and short-run assemblies. Once you get it right here, you can take it to the big guys or overseas.\nSo What is China Good For?\nAs I said the beginning, they are great at mass production.\nOne way to leverage this in your prototype is to buy components and sub systems coming out of China. To build a good prototype, you don’t need to put chips on a board; you can connect modules that exist to match the desired functionality. This is great for Alpha products.\nWhile it can change the design flow, it will allow you to mimic functionality at a fraction of the cost and time of traditional prototyping. A $50K design project can turn into a $5K proof of concept quickly.\nSeed Studio is a great Chinese resource for getting the cheapest prices on these maker components.', ""Urban Crop Solutions – sustainability and vertical farms\nBefore you dive into this article too deeply, take a moment to read the following description, and then close your eyes for a second:\nImagine yourself standing inside a climate-controlled, high-ceiling warehouse. In front of you stands a tower with eight irrigated levels, on each of which lettuces, herbs, microgreens, and baby greens grow under LED lights. Robots bring trays with young plants from outside into the right position in the growing tower, while on the other end fully grown crops are taken out, ready to be harvested. Can you see it? You are standing in a plant factory – an indoor vertical farm – a highly engineered manufacturing plant producing not goods, but crops.\nGlobal food and water challenges\nBy 2050, the world will have an additional 2.5 billion mouths to feed – 70% of which will live in urban areas. Meanwhile, 80% of the worlds arable land is already in use, existing agriculture is placing an ever-increasing toll on the environment, and the symptoms of climate change are threatening our food production capacity. You need not look further than the global record-breaking droughts we have witnessed in 2018 to see the strain under which the system finds itself. Moving the production of crops indoors and thinking vertically clears up vast areas of land.\nBy some estimates, indoor vertical farming is 350 times more productive per square meter of footprint than outdoor farming. Moreover, an indoor farm can be located anywhere in the world supplying any area with locally grown crops. This reduces the heavy logistics in the current distribution system and provides higher nutritional value for the consumers by limiting the time between harvest and consumption. As such, a higher degree of food safety can be guaranteed without the use of pesticides, herbicides, or fungicides. Compared to open field farming, a hydroponic vertical farm (plants positioned with roots in nutrient-rich water instead of soil) also uses up to 95% less water per plant.\nUrban Crop Solutions\nUrban Crop Solutions engineers and builds fully automated indoor vertical farms inside large buildings and shipping containers. The farms can be tailored to include carefully selected and tested seeds, substrates, nutrients, and a comprehensive software tool automatically provides the plants with the right combination of climate, lighting, and nutrients throughout their growth cycle. The result is a year-round production of fresh and healthy crops – anywhere.\nTo achieve these results, Urban Crop Solutions' engineers and biologists worked together closely to achieve a deep understanding of what crops need to grow, and then how a system could be engineered that would best meet those needs. An equally important component: they needed to determine how to make said system in such a way that ensured consistently high-quality output at low cost (investment and maintenance).\nHow it works\nThe engineering team focused relentlessly to develop the optimal technology for managing all plant-variables with minimal discrepancies in performance.\n- A HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) system creates an airflow that subjects all the plants to the: quasi-identical air movement speed, CO2 levels, relative humidity, and temperature throughout each layer of the system.\n- An LED light solution is tailored to each project to optimize photosynthesis of the selected crops.\n- A nutrient delivery system monitors the different chemical compounds in the water needed by the plants (which changes at different stages of growth) and delivers them directly to the roots.\nOne of the benefits of solutions such as this lies in its automation using robotics. The increasing labour costs form a problem for agriculture just about anywhere in the world, and food security can be achieved, in part, by optimizing the interaction between labour and productivity. Vertical farming is a prime example of sustainable intensification (SI) put into practice – utilising less space and resources while providing significantly more yield.\nFour engineers awarded the world’s most prestigious engineering accolade for the research and development of PERC solar photovoltaic technologyRead more\nKelly Raymont-Osman explains how engineering proved central to the design and manufacture of the Queen’s Baton ahead of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games.Read more""]"	['<urn:uuid:8c6b7971-72d7-46af-97ce-625dbfa52d0b>', '<urn:uuid:03f25653-a56b-4064-9207-4df0ab0442d6>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-02T11:45:30.494741	35	78	2156
1291	What role do natural elements play in both aesthetics and sustainability?	In traditional Japanese gardens, natural elements are carefully composed with stones as the foundation, creating layers of scenery that add depth and visual complexity while maintaining harmony. The spaces between elements define their outlines and reveal clues about volume and mass. From a sustainability perspective, using natural landscaping elements reduces water pollution by improving stormwater runoff quality, supports biodiversity by providing food and shelter for wildlife, and can save up to 25% of a household's energy consumption when trees are strategically placed. Natural landscapes also require significantly less maintenance than formal landscapes, typically costing less and requiring fewer labor hours per acre.	"[""|ancient ishigumi at spring source,|\nMiidera, Shiga Prefecture\nThe Skeleton Underpinning the View\nIn Japan the skill of a garden creator has traditionally been measured by their ability in setting stones. Master the setting of stones, then the garden will master itself. In traditional Japanese gardens what the viewer is presented with is a composed and framed view. A view which is built up, by the play of layer upon layer of scenery, adding depth and visual complexity each time. The mind though, seems to fall into a sense of equilibrium, perceiving movement yet stillness, 'equal play'. What the mind signals it's perceiving is something balanced, something in harmony. This opens the door for the viewer, now he or she can become a part of the garden. All manner of landscapes and gardens will have a similar effect on the experiencing viewer, but the japanese garden uses this aspect with a particularly deliberate effect.\nThe critical principle to the garden view is the placement of stones. The pattern of their interrelationship creates a variety of 'physiological' structure, a skeleton underlying the view. So structuring the view, making it authentic, and visually logical to our perception.\nIn the first of images below the rock arrangement is both obvious, yet also fully integrated with the accompanying planting. The skeleton is overlain by a coating of planting, in the way of flesh covering bones and giving dimension, individuality and character to a face. Identity formed.\nIn the second image, (the iconic Ryoan-ji courtyard stone garden), in this arrangement the skeleton is worn on the outside, presented without any embellishment. Here is nature in the raw. There is no planting about the stones to alleviate, shade or obscure. The scenery is composed of fifteen stones in plain view. There are no distractions, the scene is cut to its narrowest edge before it slides into pure abstraction. Open heart surgery on the concept of what constitutes a garden.\nAsymmetry, as a Building Block\nThe basic rule regarding a composition of stone is to be guided by asymmetric triangles. A dominant, or Master stone is placed, usually with a distinct upright movement. This stone then becomes the axis around which subsequent stones are placed. Most often in groups of three, five, seven pieces. Groups can link and overlap with one another, distinctions are subverted in favour of an overarching dynamic harmonisation.\nThe nature or character of the stones themselves also determines the level of emotional energy generated by an arrangement. The initial movement is upward, straight to the heavens. Creating an axis mundi, a central spindle, a fixed point to which the viewer can centre themselves on. A sacred centre. The upward thrust is supported, reinforced, from either side by flanking stones, the alignment of each are carefully collaborated. The relationship can be explored by shifting the relative position of stones until the point of maximum tension is realised. The drama inherent in good ishigumi is infinitely subtle and plastic, rather than formulaic. When the viewer is drawn into an arrangement a narrative has begun. The ishigumi speaks from one heart to another.\n|Shigemori's precisely defined arrangement,|\n|a 3- stone setting, the fundamental building block,|\nFrom Memory to Here and There\n|The stone placed on the very edge of the arrangement is an 'entry point|\nprivate garden, England\n|Reverse side of the arrangement reveals a fast running stream. Here the movement of the stone arrangement is carefully resolved by spreading the base wide, and establishes the big boulder, centre right, as the dominant visual focal point.|\nIt becomes a dance, with the poles taking the weight of the stone, holding the balance just right. Then with a couple of fingers you can rotate a stone of a ton weight or more degree by degree, until some trigger in your mind tells you the stone's aspect is correct. For me its a soft, but audible sound. Its not a thinking moment, its a moment where you empty your mind and listen for the stone to speak. It is meditation in itself. No different.\nThere are formulas to follow, such as the rule of thirds; one stone is a third the height or distance in relationship to its pairing with another. Rules are there to guide us as we learn, and when we have absorbed sufficient, then we rely of other means, not just rules for the sake of it. Learn and then unlearn, the stone itself will tell you how and where it wants to be.\nThe spaces between elements defines their outline, reveals clues as to volume and mass, and draws attention to their edge forms What is 'described' or revealed by the placement ultimately lies in the mind of the viewer. Traditionally the garden scenery describes a vision of landscape, an attempt to encapsulate an essence of landscape, rather than presenting a miniaturised reproduction of a landscape. Its the essence that we are chasing; cutting to the core, to find what is absolutely essential.\nJust as in a passage of music, an arrangement with have rhythm, tempo and emotion. Its rich voice is in the web of interconnectivity, the enclosed stage on which the action unfolds, the patina which speaks of experience and depths beneath the surface. The eye rarely takes in the whole in a glance, the bigger picture is composed of untold thousands of fragmentary snapshots.\nStones are a paradox, they appear inert and unyielding, yet they seem capable of movement and they can move us. Their weight and mass connects powerfully with the earth, yet they seem to soar. They rise from the ground. They are capable of expressing distance, depth and seem to stir memory, make connections, deep within own minds. A stone will occupy space, become a point marked, a punctuation mark in a sentence. A centre, and so according to Mircea Eliade, becomes something sacred. Rock arrangements suggest something primal, mysterious, yet redolent with meaning. A voice coming to us borne by the wind, even if the words are indistinct.\n|Norwich Cathedral, England|"", 'Benefits of Green Landscaping in the Mid-Atlantic\nSave Time and Money\nFormal landscapes and lawns are heavily dependent upon mechanical equipment, labor, pesticides, fertilizers, and supplemental watering. Collectively we spend millions of dollars on lawn care each year. The average 1-acre lawn costs $1000 and requires 40 hours of labor each year to maintain -- much more than a natural landscape.\nReduce Water Pollution\nNatural landscapes reduce the quantity and improve the quality of stormwater runoff. This reduces erosion and runoff from excess application and improper use and disposal of pesticides and fertilizers as well as spills during refueling of power equipment.\nClearing land and extensive use of grass as a groundcover increases runoff. Lawns absorb less stormwater than woodlands or a property with a diverse planting of trees, shrubs, and ground covers. Grading and landscaping aimed at moving rainwater off site as quickly as possible not only increases flooding, but lowers groundwater supplies and increases stream pollution.\nReduce Air Pollution\nEmissions from landscaping equipment (mowers, blowers, trimmers, etc.) are often much greater than that of a car for each hour of operation. Small gasoline-powered engines are the most polluting. And, older equipment tends to be worse than newer models.\nReduce Noise Pollution\nIn warm weather, residential areas are rarely peaceful due to noise from the use of mechanical landscaping equipment and vehicles. Plus, operators of the equipment are in danger of hearing loss.\nReduce Consumption of Natural Resources\nThe world only has a limited supply of natural resources and consumption rates are increasing. Typical landscaping requires:\n- energy to fuel landscaping equipment (gasoline and coal, oil and/or natural gas to generate electricity)\n- water to irrigate plants (30% of water consumption in the US is for outdoor uses)\n- soil lost through erosion after the removal of peat moss (used to improve soil) - peat moss often comes from wetlands\nReduce Solid Waste\nRECIPE FOR COMPOST\nMix together and moisten and turn occasionally until dark and crumbly (several weeks to a year):\n1 part ""green"" = fresh grass clippings, manure, garden plants, and fruit and vegetable scraps\n3 parts ""brown"" = dried leaves and plants, branches, and woody materials\nUse the compost around trees, shrubs, perennials, and even house plants to deter weeds, improve soil structure and retain moisture.\nAbout 13% of all municipal solid waste is yard waste like grass clippings and leaves. While some is picked up and composted by municipalities, over 40% still ends up in landfills. Another 13% of municipal solid waste is comprised of food scraps and less than 3% of this is composted.\nImproved Health and Safety\nReduce exposure to chemical pesticides -- Many gardeners over apply or improperly apply pesticides, putting themselves, their families, and pets at increased health risk.\nReduce or eliminate accidents from power tools and equipment -- About 230,000 people each year in the US are treated in hospital emergency rooms for injuries related to lawn and garden equipment. Plus, our clean air and drinking water are impacted from pesticides and garden equipment emissions.\nImprove Biodiversity (the number and variety of plants and animals)\nPlanting native species provides food and shelter for the insects, birds and animals that evolved along with them. Development has result in significant clearing of natural areas and fragmentation of wildlife habitat. In managing our private and public lands we can providing food, shelter, water and connectivity to mitigate this historic loss. While less than 10% of all insects are harmful to plants, many pesticides are harmful or lethal to all insects.\nNo species, not even humans, can survive alone on our planet -- we are all connected and dependent upon an intricate web of life from single celled plants floating in our oceans to the largest trees and animals.\nEliminate Invasive Plants\nInvasive plants can escape and take over natural areas which have been cleared and mismanaged. Non-native plants can choke out the wide variety of native plants on which our wildlife depends.\nPlants can significantly reduce a building\'s energy needs since it\'s cooler in the shade of trees and warmer behind plants that block the winter winds. Plant deciduous trees (those that lose their leaves in winter) on the south and west sides of a building where the sun\'s rays are most direct and intense. These trees will provide shade during summer but permit the winter sun to provide warmth. Where there isn\'t room for trees, shrubs and vines can provide similar benefits.\nThe Department of Energy found that carefully positioned trees can save up to 25% of a household’s energy consumption for heating and cooling. Trees can reduce an unshaded home’s summer air-conditioning costs by 15% to 50%. One Pennsylvania study reported air-conditioning savings of as much as 75% for small mobile homes.\nPlus trees are good for the environment because they store carbon and produce oxygen.']"	['<urn:uuid:2c30dda5-0db3-44d5-8f8a-6870fdea6800>', '<urn:uuid:6746cf37-ce06-4efc-b946-aab765c26d77>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-02T11:30:12.866257	11	102	1809
672	What role do fats play in muscle building, and why should I avoid fatty foods before exercise?	Healthy fats found in foods like avocados, nuts, and seeds are essential for hormone production and muscle recovery. However, you should avoid consuming high-fat foods, including nuts and nut butters, before working out because they take longer to digest and can make you feel sluggish. This happens because blood is diverted to your digestive system instead of your muscles, and too much fat can prevent carbs from quickly fueling your muscles.	"['Building muscle, or muscle hypertrophy, involves the enlargement of muscle cells, leading to increased muscle size and strength. It is a challenging yet rewarding process that requires a combination of resistance training, proper nutrition, and adequate rest. Whether you’re a seasoned athlete or a fitness enthusiast, understanding the fundamentals of muscle building is crucial for achieving your fitness goals.\nResistance Training: The Cornerstone of Muscle Growth\nResistance training, also known as strength training, forms the cornerstone of muscle-building endeavors. It involves challenging your muscles with external forces, such as weights, resistance bands, or your own bodyweight, to promote muscle adaptations and stimulate growth.\nProgressive Overload: The Key to Continuous Muscle Growth\nProgressive overload is a fundamental principle in resistance training that involves gradually increasing the intensity, volume, or frequency of your workouts over time. This consistent challenge is essential for continuously stimulating muscle growth and preventing plateaus.\nCompound Exercises: Building Strength and Muscle Mass\nCompound exercises are those that target multiple muscle groups simultaneously, such as squats, deadlifts, bench presses, rows, and overhead presses. These exercises are highly effective for building muscle mass and strength as they engage a greater number of muscle fibers.\nTargeted Exercises: Sculpting Specific Muscles\nWhile compound exercises are crucial for overall muscle development, targeted exercises can help refine and sculpt specific muscle groups. These exercises, such as bicep curls, tricep extensions, and lateral raises, isolate specific muscles and promote their growth.\nTraining Frequency: Striking a Balance\nThe frequency of your resistance training sessions depends on your individual needs and fitness level. However, as a general guideline, aim for 2-3 resistance training sessions per week, allowing adequate rest between workouts for muscle recovery.\nNutrition: Fueling Your Muscle-Building Journey\nNutrition plays a pivotal role in providing the essential building blocks for muscle growth and repair. A balanced diet rich in protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats is essential for fueling your muscle-building endeavors.\nProtein Intake: The Building Blocks of Muscle\nProtein is the primary component of muscle tissue, and consuming sufficient protein is crucial for muscle synthesis and growth. Aim for a protein intake of approximately 0.8–1 gram per pound of body weight daily.\nCarbohydrate Intake: Providing Energy for Workouts\nCarbohydrates provide the energy needed to fuel your workouts and replenish muscle glycogen stores. Aim for a moderate carbohydrate intake, adjusting based on your individual needs and energy expenditure.\nHealthy Fats: Supporting Hormone Production and Overall Health\nHealthy fats, such as those found in avocados, nuts, and seeds, are essential for hormone production and overall health. They also play a role in nutrient absorption and muscle recovery.\nRest and Recovery: Essential for Muscle Growth and Repair\nRest is just as important as training when it comes to muscle growth and repair. Adequate rest allows your muscles to recover from the stress of resistance training and rebuild stronger muscle fibers.\nMuscle Recovery: Prioritizing Sleep and Active Recovery\nAim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night to optimize muscle recovery and hormone production. Additionally, engage in light activities like yoga or walking on rest days to promote blood flow and muscle recovery.\nAdditional Tips for Enhancing Muscle Growth\nHydration: Stay hydrated throughout the day to optimize muscle function and nutrient transport.\nWarm-up and cool-down: Always warm up before workouts to prepare your muscles, and cool down afterward to promote recovery.\nForm and Technique: Prioritize proper form and technique to maximize muscle engagement and prevent injuries.\nProfessional Guidance: Consider consulting a certified personal trainer or dietitian for personalized advice and support.\nEmbrace the Journey of Muscle Building\nBuilding muscle requires dedication, consistency, and patience. It is a journey that takes time and effort, but the rewards are well worth it. By following these guidelines, making gradual adjustments, and listening to your body, you can achieve your muscle-building goals and enhance your overall fitness. Remember, consistency and adherence to proper training and nutrition are the keys to unlocking your muscular potential.\nFoods need to be ignored.\nThe idea of ignoring specific foods completely for building muscle is somewhat misleading. It’s more about prioritizing a balanced and nutritious diet while limiting certain types of food that can hinder your progress.\nHere are some food categories that you should minimize when aiming for muscle growth:\n1. Processed foods:\nHighly Processed Snacks: Chips, cookies, pastries, and other highly processed snacks are packed with empty calories, unhealthy fats, and added sugars. These offer little to no nutritional value and can negatively impact your muscle-building efforts.\nProcessed Meats: Sausages, bacon, and other processed meats are high in saturated fat and sodium, which can negatively impact your heart health and overall well-being. Opt for lean protein sources like chicken, fish, and beans instead.\n2. Sugary Drinks:\n- Sodas, energy drinks, and sugary juices: These drinks are loaded with sugar and calories, which can contribute to weight gain and hinder muscle growth. Replace them with water, unsweetened tea, or homemade smoothies for hydration and nutrient intake.\n3. Refined Grains:\n- White bread, pasta, and pastries: These are made with refined grains stripped of their fiber and nutrients. Choose whole-grain options like brown rice, whole-wheat bread, and quinoa for sustained energy and fiber intake.\n4. Fried Foods:\n- Fried chicken, French fries, and other deep-fried foods are high in unhealthy fats and calories, which can contribute to inflammation and hinder muscle recovery. Opt for healthier cooking methods like baking, grilling, or steaming.\n- Alcohol consumption can disrupt sleep, impair muscle recovery, and hinder muscle growth. Minimize alcohol intake for optimal muscle-building results.\nModeration and Balance:\nRemember, moderation is key. It’s not about eliminating these foods entirely but rather limiting their consumption and focusing on a balanced diet rich in whole foods, protein, complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, and fruits and vegetables. Read more blogs here.\nFocus on incorporating nutrient-dense options for optimal muscle growth.\n- Lean protein sources: chicken breast, fish, eggs, beans, lentils, and tofu.\n- Complex Carbohydrates: Whole-grain bread, brown rice, quinoa, sweet potatoes, fruits, and vegetables\n- Healthy fats: avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish.\nBy prioritizing a balanced diet and limiting the intake of the mentioned food categories, you can create an environment conducive to building muscle and optimizing your overall health.', ""10 Foods You Should Avoid Before a Workout\nWhat you eat can make your workout, but sometimes what you don't eat can be just as important. Here are the foods to avoid before you break a sweat.\nThere’s an entire industry built around hydrating and fueling up for workouts. But you may not pay as close attention to the foods you should avoid. Having the wrong stuff in your gut can prevent your workout from being as effective as it could be—or, worst case scenario, give you GI issues. “There’s no one-size-fits-all recommendation,” says Leslie Bonci, director of sports nutrition at the UPMC Center for Sports Medicine in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. “It depends on how long you’re working out, at what intensity, your weight goals, your gut tolerance.” There are, however, some basic truths when considering what will maximize your performace—and what will sabotage it.\nFuel for thought\nYour main goals in eating before a workout are to stay hydrated and to fuel your exercise. One of the most common mistakes people make is overestimating how many calories they’ll need. Generally, Bonci says, you’ll want to make sure to eat within two to three hours of a workout. But you don’t need much—around 200 calories will do it for a typical moderate- to high-intensity one-hour session. For that reason, and especially if you’re trying to lose or maintain your weight, she suggests incorporating that pre-workout nosh into a meal or splitting your meal to eat half before your workout and half after. That way, you’re less likely to overconsume calories.\nIf you don’t eat or hydrate enough before a workout, you may not have the stamina to keep pushing through. But if you eat too much, it can divert blood away from your muscles to your digestive system, slowing you down. You need to strive for a happy medium. Bonci says about 14 to 20 ounces of liquid an hour before you exercise is a good rule of thumb. And as far as food goes, you’ll want a mix of protein and carbohydrates for fuel. “What you eat before you work out won’t be immediately available as an energy source for you,” says Bonci, “but it will help prevent hunger and keep your body from tapping into muscle stores to get energy.”\nYour body needs carbs as a quick source of energy, but you can easily overdo it. “Carb loading doesn’t mean carb bloating,” says Bonci. You want a moderate amount of complex carbohydrates (whole grains over white pasta and bread), and you need enough fluids to help your body use those carbs as an energy source. (Watch out for these other fitness myths that can seriously damage your health.)\nLa Croix is lovely, but bubbly drinks shouldn’t be your choice for hydration, according to Bonci: The carbonation can cause gas and bloating, neither of which are great for an exercise routine. “Carbonation can also delay fluid getting to your muscles,” she says. Skip the sparkling water and even the kombucha, which can be fizzy.\nThere are a lot of sugary liquids masquerading as energy drinks, claiming to replenish electrolytes and help you work out harder. The problem, Bonci says, is that overhydrating can bring too much fluid into your stomach with not enough exiting, which can be detrimental to your workout. She recommends looking for a drink that has between 14 and 15 grams of carbs per 8 ounces and chugging only a single bottle. If your workout is less than an hour, you can drink water during exercise itself.\nToo much caffeine\nAlthough studies suggest that caffeine can boost your performance and reaction times, that’s only true for moderate levels (around 200 milligrams). Because the average 12-ounce cup of coffee is easily 250 to 300 milligrams, warns Bonci, you’re better off limiting yourself to a half cup. And the same rule applies to energy gels, goos, and bars spiked with caffeine, so read labels carefully.\nPotassium can help ease muscle cramping, but people tend to go a bit overboard. “Potassium loss during exercise is pretty minimal,” says Bonci. “If you’re eating a decent diet, you’re probably getting enough potassium already.” (Don’t miss these fat-burning foods that can help you lose weight.)\nFull of plant-based protein, fiber, and antioxidants, beans are one of the healthiest meals you can have. But beans, like other high-fiber foods, do have the unfortunate side effect of bloating and gas, which can interfere with your workout and cause unwanted GI symptoms, says Kelly Pritchett, PhD, RD, national spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. If you’re one of the lucky people who have a high tolerance for beans (and suffer minimal gas), you don’t have to worry. But if you aren’t used to eating them often or have experienced issues when eating them in the past, it’s probably best to avoid the three-bean salad until after your workout.\nThey’re delicious and healthy, thanks to all their healthy mono- and polyunsaturated fats. However, they can weigh you down during exercise. “High-fat foods keep you satiated longer because they take more time to digest,” says Pritchett. “But they may leave you feeling sluggish as your body is trying to digest them.” That’s mainly because your blood and other bodily resources are diverted to your digestive system, not your muscles. Too much fat of any kind can also prevent carbs from leaving the stomach quickly enough to fuel muscles. That’s why it’s best to avoid high-fat foods, including things like nuts and nut butters, as well as unhealthy fried foods, before a workout. (Look out for these 15 food myths that are making you gain weight.)\nYes, it seems counterintuitive, but those leafy greens and chopped veggies aren’t ideal pre-workout. They equal a lot of water and fiber but not a lot of protein, carbs, or calories—and you need adequate amounts of those to push through your workout, says Bonci.\nThis veggie’s star has been on the rise thanks to its cancer-fighting properties and other benefits. But members of the Brassica family including broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage are known to cause bloating and gas due to an indigestible sugar called raffinose. Because GI distress can hamper even the most committed gym goer, it’s best to save these veggies for after you hit the showers. (Check out these foods fitness pros eat to refuel after a workout.)\nWhile foods with low- to no-cal sugar substitutes are tempting when you’re trying to shed pounds, they’re a bad idea pre-workout: They’re another substance that can cause gas and bloating. What’s more, says Bonci, it’s a myth that sugar before a workout is terrible. It provides quick energy, she says, and you’re less likely to suffer a post-sugar energy dip: “Exercise activates hormones that help prevent a blood sugar crash.” Just don’t go crazy. “Sugar takes longer to leave the stomach, so if you eat a concentrated source of carbs like candy, you’ll run into problems.”\nStick with the familiar\nAnother good rule to follow when fueling up: Now is not the time to get creative or try something new. “It’s best to stick with a pre-exercise meal that the body is used to,” says Pritchett. That way, you won’t have any unexpected side effects and your body can function at its optimal levels. (Check out the 10 foods that can maximize your workout.)\nWhat really works\nSo what makes a good pre-workout snack? Bonci likes to aim for a mix of carbs, protein, and a touch of healthy fats—all of it 200 calories or less. Some of her go-tos include a six-inch tortilla thinly spread with dark chocolate, peanut butter, and half of a sliced banana; she also likes a smoothie made with half a cup of fruit, soy milk, yogurt, and a smear of nut butter. “Liquids like smoothies leave the stomach more quickly, which means they get energy to the rest of your body faster.” Regardless of what sounds most delicious and nutritious to you, just make sure you eat something before you exercise. “Even if you’re trying to lose weight, exercising on an empty stomach is not as efficient because you can’t work out up to your potential,” Bonci says. Plus, you’re likely to be hungrier as a result and overdo it at your next meal.

1275	passionate nymph fisher need successful nymph patterns suggestions big trout targeting	Black stonefly nymphs have caught the biggest trout, but other successful patterns include gold-ribbed hare's ear, prince, brown hackle peacock, deep sparkle pupa, pheasant tail, mosquito larva and midge emerger. The ability to tie your own flies is advantageous, as you can match the local insect life and are not limited to basic patterns. For hatchery supported streams, egg patterns and the San Juan Worm are effective sub-surface options, though purists may choose not to use these patterns.	['A large, dark shadow was visible in a bathtub-sized pool. The pool downstream from where I stood had produced several average-sized rainbow trout for quick release. The shadow was in a tiny pool upstream in the middle of a turbulent riffle.\nThe fly was a black, No. 16, stonefly nymph with a split shot pinched onto the leader 6 inches above the fly. After repositioning, a diagonal cast upstream dropped the fly several feet above the shadow, which allowed the fly to enter the pool without the line first passing over the fish.\nAs soon as the fly entered the pool, a strike was felt. A quick hookset and a brief struggle brought a 12-inch rainbow to the net and a quick release. This fish definitely had not created the shadow in the pool.\nAfter allowing the pool to rest, the fly was cast again above the pool. In a repeat of the previous scenario, a strike was quick to follow, but this time it was different; it was the fish that had created the shadow. He fought valiantly but was being drawn closer to the net. He made one last run toward brush in the lower pool, and I increased the pressure to turn him. As fate would have it, the hook pulled free. I muttered to myself, “I only wanted a photo”.\nThe location was the North Mills River in western North Carolina, and this fish was likely a brood fish that had been released into the stream. He appeared to be at least 24 inches or better, and at one point was only feet away. The brilliant color and black dots on his scales were vivid in the light that filtered through the overhanging tree branches.\nThis kind of action is not uncommon if you learn to fish nymphs. It is no secret that the greatest part of a trout’s life is spent near the bottom of a stream. Except in the case of a significant hatch, dry-fly fishing will not produce similar results.\nEveryone loves to catch trout on dry flies, and nothing compares with a splashy rise to a well-cast dry fly, but when the winter doldrums kick in, going deep with nymphs is the ticket for action. Also the fish will usually average much larger.\nThere are two techniques for nymphing: fishing with an indicator or high-sticking. I like to stay in contact during the drift and do not feel it is possible with an indicator. The only exception is when the fish are rising a long cast away. This may happen on large water, and I remember catching large cutthroat trout on the Yellowstone River that would have been impossible without indicators.\nThe “high stick” technique is the best strategy, especially on small streams. When properly executed, it will maintain direct contact with the fly. The procedure is to cast diagonally upstream, beyond the target area. Allow the nymph to settle to the bottom (use adequate split shot or bead-head flies). As the drift progresses and the fly draws nearer to the rod, lift the rod to maintain contact. As it passes, lower the rod tip to extend the drift. Watch the point where the line enters the water and any unusual movement or line stopping should elicit a hook-set.\nEveryone has favorite flies, and any list is sure to be argumentative. My biggest trout have responded to black stonefly nymphs, but gold-ribbed hare’s ear, prince, brown hackle peacock, deep sparkle pupa, pheasant tail, mosquito larva and midge emerger are equally successful at times. The ability to tie your own flies is a plus, as you can match the local insect life and are not limited to a few basic patterns.\nMatching insect life is important, but having the exact pattern will not assure success. If the presentation is incorrect, you will consistently fail to catch fish. It is critical to get the fly to the bottom of the stream. If you are not hanging on rocks or brush, you are not fishing deep enough. The fly or split shot should tick along the bottom where the big boys are holding. If the pool is 6 feet deep and you are fishing at a depth of 3 feet, you are not likely to consistently catch fish.\nIn cold weather, trout cannot afford the effort of moving up in the water column to chase a fly. The drift must present the fly where the trout can take it with minimal effort.\nIf you are fishing a hatchery supported stream, egg patterns fished like nymphs will catch a lot of fish. Also, the San Juan Worm is another sub-surface fly that is questionable to some. They are good options at times. This is a decision for the individual, and purists may choose not to use these patterns.\nA good strategy for winter fly fishing is to nymph fish, but be prepared to change to dry flies if you see rising trout. This is the best of both worlds. You can catch fish holding near the bottom with nymphs, but if a hatch occurs, you can take advantage with dry flies. It is pointless to pound the water to a froth with a dry fly if a hatch is not occurring. You may pick up a fish occasionally, but nymphing will be much more productive. If you have not tried nymphing, you are missing a sure-fire method of catching more trout.']	['<urn:uuid:e2faeaa6-d5b9-4396-bc52-f89260b01b2e>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-02T11:30:12.866257	11	78	905
1153	I love haunted places! Which hotels are known for ghost sightings?	Several historic hotels are known for paranormal activity. The 1886 Crescent Hotel & Spa, known as 'America's most haunted hotel', has reported ghost sightings of Michael, an Irish stonemason who died in Room 218. The Stanley Hotel, which inspired 'The Shining', is reportedly haunted by its original owner F.O. Stanley and his wife, who appear in formal attire on the main staircase, and Flora's piano can sometimes be heard playing in the ballroom. Additionally, the Dolphin Hotel's room 1408 has a dark history with 56 deaths over 95 years, 27 of which were natural deaths.	['Released in 2007\nThe haunted house is, arguably, one of the most successful tropes in the horror genre, perhaps due to an almost ubiquitous fear that our homes could shift from places of great safety to sites of our extreme vulnerability. The idea that what we most have to fear could be lurking in just the next room is one which has been exploited in horror literature and film for many years. We have seen the concept of the ‘evil house’, wherein the danger lurks in the very bricks and mortar surrounding us and the impact this has on the minds of those caught within, for example, Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining (1980) and Mark Danielewski’s House of Leaves (2000). 1408, based on a Stephen King short story, locates the terror in an even smaller geographical space; a single hotel room in the centre of New York City.\nAccompanying the viewer into this little section of Hell is Mike Enslin (John Cusack); the jaded, cynical, albeit relatively successful author of such titles as 10 Haunted Graveyards and 10 Haunted Lighthouses. For a man who so fervently denies any belief in ghosts, what these titles tell us is that Mike has certainly dedicated a vast portion of his life to searching for them, but has as yet been unsuccessful in his quest. In his dogged determination to investigate alleged hauntings wherever he can find them we see that, like the maverick FBI agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) from Chris Carter’s The X-Files (1993-2002), Mike truly does want to believe. As he says to his fans, ‘Nothing would make me happier than to witness a paranormal event’. Indeed, the reason for his desire to discover evidence of an after-life is slowly revealed as the film progresses and we witness the tragic events leading up to his acrimonious separation from his wife, Lily. While researching a new book, Mike hears about the legend of room 1408 in The Dolphin Hotel. To begin with the viewer cannot help but join him in his mild amusement when he first makes contact with the establishment to enquire about the room; only to be told, ‘That room is unavailable, sir’. ‘Wait a minute’, says Mike, ‘I didn’t tell you which date’. Stony silence ensues from the surly receptionist, then, ‘It’s unavailable’.\nOn the face of it, this is mere myth-building on the part of hotel staff, and holds all the faux terror of the fairground ghost train, with the audience being challenged to ‘roll up’ for what will inevitably be a fairly dull, uneventful experience. Indeed, this is how Mike sees it, as he calls his agent to pull some strings and get him booked in. However, he must still overcome the misgivings of the hotel manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) who Mike must circumvent in order to secure one night in room 1408. Olin delivers his stock spooky lines with panache, “nobody’s ever lasted more than an hour [in that room]”; “I don’t want to clean up the mess”. At certain points Olin even seems to have slightly rattled Mike’s scepticism with his warnings.\nWe then begin to discover that room 1408 does indeed have a noteworthy history. Olin shows Mike a scrapbook documenting the room over the last 95 years. We learn that there have been 56 deaths in room 1408 since the hotel opened. 27 of these deaths were described as natural; the other’s... less so. If the first real tremors of trepidation begin to run through the viewer, Mike remains unimpressed, berating Olin for trying to scare him with tales of ‘ghoulies and ghosties and long-legged beasties’. Not to be robbed of the final words in the exchange, however, Olin responds with utter seriousness, ‘I have never used the word “phantom”. It’s just an evil fucking room’.\nIt has to be said that Jackson and Cusack are unusually big names for 21st century horror cinema. Since so much of the film revolves around their performances, particularly around that of Cusack, that the investment in top actors was a wise decision on the part of the casting team. Too often in horror films we see good ideas ruined by frankly poor execution. For a horror film to work the actors need to make you empathize with their characters in order to make you care about the fact that they may at some point in the film face a grisly death. This is what we get in 1408. Cusack is phenomenal here; not only do we see the cynical, sarcastic side of Mike, which he portrays to the world as a kind of shield to keep people from getting too close, but over the course of the film we also see him as a man who has made a great many mistakes throughout his life and regrets them all deeply. He is also likeable, despite (or perhaps because of) all his flaws, and even more importantly, he is absolutely hilarious. Cusack delivers his lines with impeccable comic timing, and this is highlighted even more clearly in the scenes he shares with Jackson, who is similarly gifted at delivering this kind of deadpan humour. Even towards the end of the film, when things have spiralled well out of control, some of Cusack’s reactions and delivery had me laughing out loud. It is a testament to the actors’ abilities and the quality of the script that humour and horror are blended so well in this film, providing emotional contrast to the rather doom-laden plot.\nOf course, when we finally see it, the room itself is actually rather... nice. A sentiment that is echoed by Mike as he stands in the doorway, peering in, ‘This is it? Where’s the bone chilling terror? Show me the rivers of blood’. It is spacious and well-lit; it has a mini-bar that Mike makes increasing use of throughout his time in the room; the pictures adorning the walls are bland, yet somehow comforting. All in all, somewhere I would not mind staying a night. I mean, sure, there are problems: a closer inspection with a UV light reveals some rather ominous bloodstains scattered throughout the room; the thermostat is broken making the space unbearably stuffy, which the hotel engineer refuses to enter the room in order to fix; and the radio alarm clock keeps switching itself on periodically (always, horrifically, playing The Carpenter’s ‘We’ve Only Just Begun’). Nevertheless, thinks Mike, ‘it does have its charms’. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, this is where we spend the next horrendously uncomfortable hour or so of the film, trapped in a hotel room which grows less and less charming by the minute. Of course, by the time Mike has witnessed enough to persuade him that Olin might have been telling the truth it is too late and the room simply refuses to let him go. At this point, the clock radio portentously begins a slow 60 minute countdown.', 'Historic Hotels of America has launched a new Super Site that lets you follow your American Dreams and choose from a variety of different vacation ideas, including family getaways, road trips, national parks and lands, culinary destinations, urban adventures, and more (http://americandreams.historichotels.org/index) featuring more than 260 historic hotels across the United States from Puerto Rico to Hawaii.\n“Exploration has always driven the American Dream.

711	I'm new to guns. What exactly does ballistics mean?	Ballistics refers to the science of projectiles - it describes how a round moves, from the initial squeeze of the trigger to when the bullet hits a target. This can apply to anything from a thrown stick to an intercontinental warhead.	['The ballistics of a firearm can refer to multiple processes inside and outside a gun. Overall, it refers to how a round moves, from the initial squeeze of the trigger to when the bullet hits a target.\nThe word “ballistics” is a word we hear often but don’t actually consider its meaning. Referring to the science of projectiles, ballistics can apply to a stick you’ve thrown through the air or an intercontinental warhead carrying a hydrogen bomb.\nA ballistics chart is an instrumental piece of data for any gun owner. If you want to discharge your firearm safely and more effectively, then you should familiarize yourself with the ballistics chart specific to your firearm.\nBelow we’ll cover the key features of ballistics charts to help you better understand your firearm.\nBefore we get to how a bullet actually travels through the air, it is important to note that the ballistics of a firearm begins in the barrel when the gun discharges. Let’s take a Winchester ballistics chart, specifically the .222, as an example.\nA Winchester .222 ballistics chart has varied options for ammunition weight, from 40 to 60 grains. This refers to the amount of powder within each cartridge. The more powder, the greater the pressure within the barrel when the firearm discharges.\nHigher pressure in the barrel means a higher exit velocity. Exit velocity is the speed the bullet is traveling immediately as it leaves the barrel. Since this calculation depends on the type of round and the length of the barrel, it is critical to understand ammunition ballistics and the specs of your firearm.\nA faster moving projectile, therefore, will have a completely different trajectory than one that exits the barrel at a lower speed. As well, the shape and type of round you are discharging, such as hollow point versus soft point, will change the trajectory of the projectile.\nHeaded to the shooting range? Be sure to check out our top picks for gun range bags.\nA rifle ballistics chart outlines how a given round will behave upon discharge from a specific rifle. However, these charts have different numbers and calculations that may seem confusing at a glance. Below is an outline and explanation for each category of a ballistics chart:\n- Velocity – probably the most easily understood spec, this measures the speed of a bullet at certain distances. Measured in feet per second, the speed of a bullet depends on its mass. The greater the mass, the slower the projectile will travel.\n- Energy – this is a vague term that is perhaps the most important stat on a ballistics chart. The energy of a projectile refers to the amount of energy delivered to a target by a bullet. This factor is affected by drag, also known as retardation, the projectile encounters as it moves through the air.\n- Short Range Trajectory – this part of the ballistics chart indicates how high or low you should sight your firearm depending on the distance to the target. Short range trajectories assume you have sighted your gun to zero at a nearer distance, such as 150 meters.\n- Long Range Trajectory – trajectories for targets at further distances are set to zero at a greater distance, such as 200 meters, compared to the short range trajectory.\nExternal Ballistics Explained\nNow that you have a basic understanding of what and why certain information is on a ballistics chart let’s break down further what some of the more complicated terms, such as trajectory and energy, actually mean when firing a weapon.\nEnergy is, in part, the speed of the projectile as it leaves the firearm. However, this speed depends on the length of the barrel, the size of the cartridge, and the shape.\nThe ideal shape for a cartridge is much like those you see today, a parabolic-shaped nose cone with a long, skinny body. Naturally, jamming more powder into a cartridge would increase the energy of a weapon. However, the barrel of a firearm can only withstand certain pressure. Too much powder would result in excess gas in the barrel, and cause injury to the shooter.\nAnother factor, mentioned above, is drag, or retardation. The faster the bullet goes, the more drag. If you look at a ballistics chart for the Winchester .222, it lists rounds from 40 to 60 grains. A 60 grain round has lower energy than a 55-grain round since the round with greater mass is more affected by drag.\nMeasuring the trajectory of a projectile is tricky. The sight of a firearm is typically two inches above the barrel and angled downward, so that the line of sight (LOS) of the shooter meets, at some pre-calibrated point, the path of the projectile.\nAnyone with a sighted rifle will calibrate their site depending on location and target type. If you want to shoot small game at short distances, then you will calibrate your sight to match the zero on the short-range trajectory ballistics chart for your weapon. Using the chart, you can then raise or lower your gain as specified in the chart for the type of ammunition you are using.\nFor longer range trajectory, you will adjust your sight to the distance indicated in the long-range section of your firearm’s ballistics chart. Adjust your aim accordingly depending on the distance to your target, as per the long-range trajectory section on the ballistics chart.']	['<urn:uuid:7ebc7106-9f6f-4733-bbd6-ab812b11e41c>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-01T23:21:14.341336	9	41	899
941	Hey, I've heard that some cities are letting regular people decide how to spend their money. Which Finnish city is leading the way in giving citizens control over spending decisions?	The City of Helsinki has been a forerunner in participatory budgeting. They first implemented it in 2012 with library improvements using EUR 100,000, and later expanded through projects like RuutiBudjetti for youth and OmaStadi, which allows residents over 12 years to decide how to use about EUR 4 million of the budget.	['In recent years, participatory budgeting has become more common in Finland and around the world as part of the planning of general government finances. An increasingly low voter turnout in elections may increase interest in the use of participatory budgeting in decision-making.\nThe idea of participatory budgeting may sound simple: giving people an opportunity to influence their environment directly, whereby they will probably select the best ideas. However, research shows that it is not quite as simple as this: the people who are the most eager to participate in decision-making are those who are already socially active.\nParticipatory budgeting is a process that provides citizens with an opportunity to influence the allocation of appropriations. The model can be used on all levels of government, but most of the experiments have been conducted on town or regional level.\nParticipatory budgeting projects in Finland have so far been relatively small\nIn Finland, participatory budgeting generated public debate for the first time in 2011 as a result of Sitra’s New Democracy project, which aimed at providing ideas on how to increase citizens’ participation in decision-making. In 2012, the City of Helsinki and Sitra implemented library improvements proposed by city residents with an appropriation of EUR 100,000. The City of Helsinki has also otherwise been a forerunner in participatory budgeting. In 2013, the model was extended to the Youth Department through RuutiBudjetti.\nRuutiBudjetti allocates the Helsinki Youth Department an appropriation the uses of which are planned by young people together with the employees of the department. The share of RuutiBudjetti of the City’s total budget is small. However, it is noteworthy that the appropriation is allocated annually. The most important participatory budgeting experiment in Helsinki is the OmaStadi project. It allows the residents to decide how to use about EUR 4 million of the budget. The amount is distributed to the different districts of the City, and all residents over 12 years may vote and submit ideas on how to use the funds. The most recent OmaStadi project was implemented in 2018–2019, and an assessment on its implementation will be published later this year.\nParticipatory budgeting has become increasingly popular. However, according to a questionnaire survey conducted by the Association of Finnish Municipalities in 2018, only 12% of the municipalities (i.e. 22 municipalities) had tried it. The participatory budgeting experiments have been geographically concentrated in the Greater Helsinki Area. A project corresponding to Helsinki’s RuutiBudjetti is, for example, Espoo’s ManiMiitti, which enables Espoo’s young residents to participate in allocating the appropriation. A significant project in Tampere, in turn, was the revamp of the recreational area of Tesoma in 2014. The appropriation allocated to this project was EUR 110,000. In Tampere, the project that corresponds to Helsinki’s OmaStadi is Mun Tampere, which has been allocated an appropriation of EUR 450,000. Vantaa, in turn, allows the residents of Martinlaakso and Hakunila to decide on the use of EUR 50,000 of the budget funds. The aim is to make these areas more attractive. This is the third experiment in Vantaa. The first one was the Meidän Korso project in 2019.\nSo far, the participatory budgeting experiments in Finland have been small in relation to the number or total budgets of municipalities. For example, the largest participatory budgeting project in Finland, OmaStadi, is considerably smaller than corresponding experiments in other European towns, which may use several per cent of their budgets for participatory budgeting.\nAnother challenge is posed by the lack of continuity, as only about a half of the participatory budgeting projects are continuous, i.e. annually recurring. Moreover, if the social and health care reform is implemented, the continuation of participatory budgeting in municipalities is uncertain, as some of the municipalities’ tasks would become the responsibility of counties. The risk is that decision-making moves even further away from the residents, which might also reduce the transparency of public administration.\nParticipatory budgeting was first developed to meet the need for direct democracy in South America\nThe first participatory budgeting experiment was conducted in Porto Alegre in Brazil on the initiative of the Brazilian Labour Party (PT) in 1989. The experiment was substantially linked with the idea of radical democracy. Radical democracy refers to citizens’ direct participation in decision-making with the aim to improve the transparency of public administration. Non-governmental organizations have had an important role in the development of radical democracy. Another important idea underlying radical democracy is targeting resources at the poor. The Porto Alegre experiment was considered successful, and participatory budgeting was extended to other towns in Brazil and South America.\nIn addition to radical democracy, a liberal view of better governance has been highlighted when participatory budgeting has become a global phenomenon. According to the liberal view, participatory budgeting underlines good governance. Participatory budgeting has been actively promoted by international organizations, particularly the World Bank and UN-Habitat. The World Bank has supported several developing countries in projects aiming at better governance. Participatory budgeting is, in fact, closely linked with Sustainable Development Goal 16 on good governance in the 2030 Agenda.\nThe most significant promoter of participatory budgeting after the World Bank and the UN is the European Union. The EU provides development aid to Latin America, for example, through a programme where the focus is on promoting participatory budgeting.\nAfter South America, participatory budgeting is utilized the most in Europe, although the model does not extend to the EU budgeting. The method is mainly applied on regional or municipal level. Poland has even incorporated participatory budgeting into the national law, and Portugal has financed projects from the state budget.\nThe results of an international survey (Open budget survey) conducted in 2019 show that several countries have difficulties in achieving sufficient transparency in their budgeting. According to the report, the countries with a transparent budgeting process are more democratic, developed and equal than average. The key idea in participatory budgeting is indeed to involve citizens in decision-making and to improve the transparency of public administration.\nMost of the participatory budgeting surveys and projects have been targeted at local and regional government. The possibility of using participatory budgeting in different states’ budgeting processes would require more research.\nParticipatory budgeting has been implemented by four different methods\nThe ways of implementing participatory budgeting can be divided into four different methods. The first one is named according to the best-known town where participatory budgeting was experimented, i.e. Porto Alegre. In this model, participatory budgeting is included in the budget of a town or municipality, and citizens submit budget proposals in cooperation with public officials. The Porto Alegre experiment, which started at the end of the 1980s, is the clearest example of this type of budgeting, where one of the underlying ideas was radical democracy.\nAnother method is to allocate an appropriation, as for example in the library project in Helsinki. The problem with this method is that the projects are often one-off initiatives, which means that they do not necessarily lead to the targeted long-term development of municipal democracy.\nIn the third, percentage-based model, citizens are allowed to decide on the use of a certain share of the municipal budget. In this model, citizens are fully entitled to decide on allocations, while the local government is only responsible for implementing the decisions. In 2017, Pudasjärvi introduced a percentage for participatory budgeting with the aim, in particular, to increase employment and achieve other socio-economic improvements.\nThe fourth and last method is the ‘pooling’ model, where funding from several different sources is directed at the development of a certain area. An example of the pooling model is the building of a foot and cycle path in the municipality of Karvia in 2010. The funding for the project came from several actors, and the residents were actively involved in both the planning and implementation.\nAll of these four methods are represented in the participatory budgeting experiments conducted in Finland. The most frequently used ones are the Porto Alegre model and the appropriation model.\nCould participatory budgeting be extended to the state budget?\nPerhaps the biggest risk related to participatory budgeting is, paradoxically, the participatory deficit. Even if the aim is to involve as many citizens as possible, it is possible that only the most active ones actually participate. A project that has aimed at being inclusive risks becoming exclusive. For example, organizing voting regarding the spending of funds mainly online places people who do not use the Internet in a somewhat unequal position even if it were possible to submit proposals and vote in other ways as well.\nCould participatory budgeting be extended to state budget? A challenge to this idea may be posed by the fact that the state budget process is far more complicated than the municipal one. Another challenge may be posed by the question of the position of representative democracy.\nThe participatory deficit detected in municipal experiments would most probably also apply to the state budget. However, it would be justified to look into the opportunities of participatory budgeting even on central government level, as especially the experiences gained in Brazil in the 1980s show that, at its best, participatory budgeting can increase well-being. Participatory budgeting might also bring new perspectives on the budget structure or how it is presented.\nThe international umbrella organization of Supreme Audit Institutions, INTOSAI, cooperates with the International Budget Partnership, which supports the development of open budgeting in over a hundred countries. It has, for example, published a Government Guide on transparent budgeting. According to the organization, budget information should be understandable to citizens, as they have the right to obtain information on the collection and use of public funds and to influence this process.\nWriter: Miro Kapanen.

566	As a theater historian studying early Black playhouses, I'm curious about how the African Grove Theatre influenced both 19th century performances and modern Black theater institutions. What were its historical achievements, and how does its legacy continue in contemporary theater organizations?	The African Grove Theatre, established by William Henry Brown in 1821, was groundbreaking as the first theater to allow all-black casts to perform plays originally written for White actors, including Shakespeare's Richard III and Othello. It produced two notable actors: James Hewlett, the first African American Shakespearean actor, and Ira Aldridge, who later became internationally renowned. The theater, located on Prince Street, became popular with both Black audiences (who attended after church on Sundays) and White patrons, though racist opposition eventually forced its closure. Its legacy continues through modern institutions like the New Heritage Theatre Group, which carries on the mission of presenting quality productions for the community at affordable prices, and various Harlem theaters that focus on telling Black stories through their own lens, such as Blackberry Productions and the Classical Theater of Harlem.	['Ira Aldridge was a teenager discovering his love of theatre before becoming the first of his kind to be known internationally. William Henry Brown established a theatre before writing what many considered to be the first play of its kind. James Hewlett was a tailor by trade before becoming the first of his kind to star in a one-man show. These prominent Black men, during the early part of the 19th century, played a pivotal role in shaping America’s Black Theatres, especially in Washington, D.C.\nThe history of this movement in the district was a topic briefly mentioned during a discussion last night at the Historical Society of Washington, D.C. (HSW) on K Street NW. The event, “Theatre District: How Washington, D.C. Became a National Stage for the Performing Arts,” was a look at how the city evolved into “a theatre-Mecca second only to New York City,” according to HSW Executive Director Sandy Bellamy.\n“There are scores of dance, choral music, instrumental music and opera companies in our midst,” said Linda Levy Grossman, moderator and president/CEO of the Helen Hayes Awards, which honors professional theatre in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. But Monday night’s discussion, the first of HSW’s fall programming, was to focus solely on theatre.\nKicking off a brief overview of the city’s history was an 11-minute video titled “Again and Again: The Legacy of Washington Theatre.” According to the film, the city’s first playhouse was a bare room inside a hotel on E Street NW in the early 1800s. Two new playhouses – featuring “everything from acrobats to the finest classical actors from both sides of the Atlantic”– were constructed in 1804 and 1822 to accommodate growing audiences. And in 1835, the National Theatre opened three blocks from The White House on Pennsylvania Avenue.\nFollowing its opening, the building was destroyed by fire and rebuilt on the same site five times during the 1800’s, according to nationaltheatre.org. In the time preceding the Civil War, opera houses and music halls dotted the downtown area. After the war, the city underwent another transformation. Between 1885 and 1915, 37 new theatres opened in a block bordered to the south by 9th Street, to the east by Pennsylvania Avenue, to the north by 15th Street and the west by New York Avenue. And while this enlivened, six-block theatre district was created downtown, an area known as “Black Broadway” was taking shape uptown.\nAt the time, Segregation forced African Americans nationwide to establish their own organizations and institutions as a way of supporting their lifestyles. And thanks to William Henry Brown, a West-Indian born U.S. theatre producer and playwright, African-American artists also had a blueprint for establishing their own playhouses. “As it happens, African-American theater flourished as early as 1821,” writes Heidi Weiss in a September 2006 Chicago Sun-Times article. That same year, Brown, a retired steam ship steward, created the African Grove from “a little tea garden and cabaret” behind his house in lower Manhattan. African Grove was the first of its kind to allow an all-black casts to perform plays originally written for White actors, which included Shakespeare’s Richard III and Othello.\nThe company’s productions soon became a popular diversion with White audiences, which started a rivalry “between this small theater and Stephen Price’s Park Theater,” according to a web lecture on the African Grove Theater. As the story goes, Brown rented a hall right next to the Park Theater for performance of Richard III after being ousted from his house on Thomas Street. Brown’s production coincided with the Park Theater’s presentation of the same play. According to the online lecture, “Stephen Price hired a mob to stage a ‘riot’ and had the police shut down the African Grove performances.” Laura Blanchard, vice chair of the American Branch of the Richard III Society, writes on the organization’s Web site that the African Grove moved to Mercer and Bleecker streets on October 1. The company was again forced to close down in 1823. That same year, Brown wrote The Drama of King Shotaway, the first African American play to be written and produced in the United States. The play is based on a Black Carib revolt on the island of St Vincent in 1796 against both English and French settlers.\nDuring the time of African Grove, Brown’s company produced two notable actors: James Hewlett, the first African American Shakespearean actor, and Ira Aldridge, a teenager at the time. According to blackpast.org, an online reference guide to African American History, Hewlett and Aldridge honed their skills “while sitting in the balcony of Stephen Price’s landmark Park Theatre observing the acting styles of European transports in Shakespearian plays.”\nBorn 1778, James Hewlett’s education of theatre came from following behind British actor George Frederick Cooke as a servant boy, when he learned to imitate the actor’s actions and attitude. But, according to a Dec. 22, 1825 article in The Star, the young man had something else going for him. “Hewlett…must have had a natural talent for theatrical performances and an excellent voice, or he could never have surmounted his early difficulties,” the newspaper reported. Those difficulties were the result of racism. In addition to working as a waiter and tailor by trade, Hewlett was a role model for the African Grove’s younger member, Ira Aldridge. When Hewlett joined the theatre company in 1821, he attempted Richard III with an all‐black cast and played the title role in Brown’s The Drama of King Shotaway. But much of his life after the African Grove is a blur. According to the Oxford Companion to American Theatre, he “seems to have confined his appearances to recitals devoted largely to imitations of famous White actors.”\nAmong his honors, Hewlett was called “the most astonishing phenomena of the age” by an 1826 advertisement. In addition, the ad goes on to describe him as: “a young man, who, notwithstanding the thousands of obstacles which the circumstance of complexion must have thrown in his way of improvement, has, by the mere dint of natural genius and self‐strengthened assiduity, risen to a successful competition with some of the first actors of the day.” Later billed as “Shakespeare’s proud Representative,” he disappeared after a farewell benefit in 1831. According to blackpast.org, Hewlett passed in 1836.\nIra Aldridge, an American stage actor who made his career largely on the London stage, is the only African American actor among the 33 actors of the English stage with bronze plaques at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford-upon-Avon. Born on July 24, 1807 to Reverend Daniel and Luranah Aldridge, Ira’s first professional acting experience was in the early 1820s with the African Grove, according to various sources. There, he debuted as Rolla in Pizzaro, played Shakespeare’s Romeo and later gained fame for his portrayal of Hamlet.\nConfronted with persistent racism in the U.S., Ira emigrated to England, where he worked as a dresser to the British actor Henry Wallack. His move from the U.S. sparked a series of tours that started in 1831, when he successfully played in Dublin, along with several locations in southern Ireland, Bath, and Edinburgh. He eventually toured Europe in 1852, and was successful in Germany – where he peformed for Frederick William IV of Prussia after being presented to the Duchess Saxe-Coburg-Gotha – and in Budapest. Ira spent most of his final years in Russia – where he met Leo Tolstoy, Mikhail Shchepkin and Taras Shevchenko – and in continental Europe. He died in August 1867.\nThe spirits of Aldridge, Hewlett and Brown’s African Grove motivated the theatre movement on D.C.’s “Black Broadway” during the dawning of the 20th century, when the city became the social and cultural capital of Black America, according to the PBS documentary, “Melodies and Memories.” “From 1900 to 1920, it was this country’s largest African American community. Anchored by Howard University and federal government jobs, this community became a magnet for African American intellectuals and sent a stream of shining talents to the nation for generations,” according to PBS’s Web site. “It developed a prosperous Black middle class which forged a strong society of churches, newspapers, businesses and civic institutions.”\nAmong those institutions were the Howard and Lincoln theaters. Created in 1910, the Howard Theater at 620 T Street NW was a stucco-clad building that originally served “as a playhouse for both variety shows and moving pictures catering to African-American audiences,” according to a January 2008 Staff Report for Howard Theater. “The Howard is the oldest surviving and the first known theater in the country built just for Black audiences during segregation when Blacks were barred from attending or performing at White theaters.” Success of the 1,200-seat auditorium helped energize the debuts of other Black-owned theaters, such as the Apollo in Harlem, the Uptown in Philadelphia, and the Royal in Baltimore (or the Chitlin’ Circuit), according to “Historic U Street Jazz,” a project of George Washington University. The theater closed its doors when the Great Depression hit in 1929. When it reopened its doors in 1931, the theater moved away from providing variety acts to solely jazz performances. The city’s desegregation in the early 1960’s and the 1968 unrest that ensued after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. led to the Howard closing its doors in 1970. The theater is currently closed with plans for renovations.\nLike the Howard, the Lincoln Theater was designed as a movie theater for black patrons in 1921. Initially, it was where African Americans saw vaudeville acts, first-run films, and amateur competitions. When the Lincoln switched owners in 1927, the theater was expanded to include “a cabaret, a hot nightspot, and a dance hall called the Lincoln Colonnade,” according to GWU’s “Historic U Street Jazz.”\nThe Presidential Ball came to the Lincoln in the 1940s, and the first ladies Eleanor Roosevelt and Bess Truman used the theater for a March of Dimes rally. “The Lincoln’s name, its decor, its cabaret, and the politically and socially elite visitors all worked to affirm the importance, not only of the Lincoln, but of the community on U. Street,” according to “Historic U Street Jazz.”\nAnd like the Howard, the Lincoln Theater suffered from the city being fully integrated in the 1960’s. Following the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954, Black businesses moved downtown and along with them went majority of the neighborhood’s prominent residents. The unrest of 1968 also ended the Lincoln’s golden era. “The Lincoln played B movies until it was permanently closed in 1982,” according to Historic U Street Jazz. “Currently, the Lincoln remains in the custody of the District Government and is awaiting a proposal for restoration.”\nLast night, Grossman, moderator and president/CEO of Helen Hayes Awards, had a question for the audience. “Who here has, at some time in recent history, attended a Washington theatre performance as an audience member?” At the sight of every hand raised, she said, “Excellent! A’s for everyone.”\nToday, the total number of theatres in D.C. quadrupled from 14 in 1983 to more than 70 now. In 2008, alone, 69 of the city’s area theatres – plus theatre festivals – produced 428 productions, 169 readings and 154 festival productions, the moderator said. The total? It’s around 8,723 performances seen by almost two million audience members. So if everyone in the room attended even one of those productions in 2008, she said, they played a critical role in confirming the city’s current reputation. “The quantity of productions maintains Washington’s tradition as the second most prolific theatre town in the country,” Grossman said. “But the quality and the diversity of the work produced here make Washington second to none.”', 'I am thankful for love, life, the pursuit of happiness, family, good friends, good health, to be alive on planet earth, a member of my culture and of service to the human race that I live in the United States of America and for President Barack Obama. How about you?\nI am also thankful for Community Works NYC and New Heritage Theatre Group, which, in conjunction with the Interchurch Center and partners, presented the New York premiere of the expanded, comprehensive exhibition “Harlem is … Theater.” The exhibit, which is a public art and education program under the auspices of Community Works NYC, features narratives on the fascinating history of Black theater, along with other relics, photos and memorabilia.\n“Harlem is … Theater” is currently open to the public now through February, after which it will then be displayed at the New York Public Library of the Arts at Lincoln Center. The exhibit does an excellent job of portraying the artistry, commitment and rich history of Black theater, where it began and how it continues to evolve.\nThe artist’s ability to bring a story to life through their portrayal of a vision, a dream or a slice of life is what makes theater so compelling. Black theater, as Stephanie Berry, founder and co-artistic director of Blackberry Productions, stated, “allows Black artists to tell our stories, through our lens and not have someone else misappropriate our stories or take them from us.”\nGreetings at the opening reception were made by Barbara Horowitz, founder and president of Community Works NYC. She introduced several of today’s prominent artists, who have contributed to the longevity of Black theater by dedicating themselves to carrying on the art. There to do what he does so well was Darryl T. Downing, ensuring the evening ran smoothly and without a hitch, which it did.\nAppearing on stage was George Faison, co-founder and artistic director of the Faison Firehouse Theatre, who said, “In our outreach training program, we listen to the young artists, which is something few adults do.”\nIn that same vein, Berry said, “We at Blackberry Productions have committed ourselves to cultivating new works by Black writers.”\nAlso appearing on stage, Ray Gaspard, president of the Frederick Douglass Creative Arts Center, said, “Our after-school filmmaking programs are designed to enhance the children’s interest in learning.”\nAcknowledged was Gertrude Jeannette, who was not in attendance, as she was preparing to celebrate her 100th birthday Nov. 28. Jeannette is the founder and CEO of the HADLEY Players. She was also the first female licensed in the United States to drive a taxicab—just a bit of trivia. “Our mission,” she stated, “is to provide Harlem with professional theater at affordable prices.” A video clip featuring Jeannette is also part of the exhibit.\nDue to a scheduling conflict, Woodie King Jr., founder and producing director of New Federal Theatre and founder and producing director of the National Black Touring Circuit, was unable to attend but was quoted as saying, “If corporations are going to make money in Harlem, they must provide funding to support the local arts organizations.”\nContinuing the program, James Pringle, founder of Harlem Theatre Company, noted, “Our goal was to produce actors who were intelligent, well-trained and professional.”\nBarbara Ann Teer, visionary founder of the National Black Theatre, once said, “Theater is a healing art form that must be located in an energy center … Harlem has that kind of energy.”\nGarland Lee Thompson Sr., co-founder and executive director of Frank Silvera’s Writers’ Workshop, said, “Theater people in Harlem have to collaborate more with each other and gain control of the venues in which we present our works.”\nDebra Ann Byrd, producing artistic director of Take Wing and Soar Productions and founder of Harlem Shakespeare Festival, said, “We can change this conversation, locally, nationally and internationally.”\nTy Jones, producing artistic director of the Classical Theater of Harlem, said, “We are out to entertain diverse audiences who desire to be highly engaged emotionally and highly satisfied intellectually by productions that are anchored in the context of the African Diaspora.”\nHow could you possibly talk about Black theater in Harlem and not talk about Vy Higginsen, Ken Wydro and Higginsen’s daughter Ahmaya Knoelle, co-writers, co-producers and co-directors of “Mama, I Want to Sing” and “Mama Foundation for the Arts.” Both mother and daughter spoke vibrantly about how “Mama’s mission is to preserve, present and promote the culture of African American music and dance.”\nLast but certainly not least to be recognized was Voza Rivers, founding member and executive producer of New Heritage Theatre Group, where Jamal Joseph is executive artistic director. Rivers was quoted as saying, “New Heritage is continuing Roger Furman’s mission of presenting quality productions for the community at affordable prices.” Rivers went on to say that he discovered theater when he began his quest to find his voice. His search was to discover how he was going to contribute to society. He then discovered Roger Furman. Rivers, though humble and unassuming, continues to be a beacon in the community not only when it comes to theater, but especially when it comes to being an inspiration to others struggling to find their art.\nFurman was a trained actor and theater arts producer who wanted to do more with anti-poverty programs, which were at their height of existence during the 1960s, than just collect a check. Furman wanted theater to be an integral part of the initiative, an art form that would last long after the funds ran out, and the term “anti-poverty” was no longer in vogue. Hence, his spirit lives on at the New Heritage Theatre Group as an inspiration to all aspiring artists and those who can love and appreciate Black theater.\nSeeing and hearing those who continue to carry the torch underscores the brilliance of “The Harlem is … Theater” exhibition. Little is known by the general public of New York’s historic Black theaters. The earliest recollection begins with the African Grove Theatre, which is recorded as the first theater to produce dramatic works by and for Blacks. The exhibit will explain how the theater, located on Prince Street, would produce works by Shakespeare. The Black audience would come to the theater after church on Sundays and became a very popular venue for Black entertainment. Intrigued by its popularity, shortly thereafter, white patrons began to visit the theater as well. Appalled at the ability of Blacks to put on such fine productions, they began to cast negative and disparaging remarks and comments, often interrupting the actors on stage, sometimes going so far to summon the police to arrest the actors while on stage. The theater soon closed.\nIt wasn’t until 1935 that Black theater would emerge again thanks to the WPA Federal Theatre’s Project Harlem Unit. This was followed by the Rose McClendon Players, the American Negro Theater, New Heritage Theatre Group and the New Lafayette Theatre, which was “a proponent of Ritual Theater created to ‘bind together and strengthen Black people so that they can survive the long struggle that is to come.’” That was in 1973.\nUntil next week … kisses']	['<urn:uuid:c101a550-e6d4-4085-82e3-9426538e9032>', '<urn:uuid:779eca8d-6581-409f-8781-658dfa01ad33>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-01T22:36:12.692263	41	135	3122
763	Which protected water area is bigger, Nha Trang Bay or Great Barrier Reef?	The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is significantly larger than Nha Trang Bay. The Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area covers 347,800 square kilometers, making it the largest marine protected area in the world, while Nha Trang Bay has a surface area of only 507 square kilometers.	"['Nha Trang Bay is located in the province of Khan Hoa, at the southern maritime area in Central Vietnam. With a surface area of 507 square kilometers, the bay stretches between Cay Cape in the north and Dong Ba Cape in south. The coastline consists of two different parts – continental and island. Both contribute to a great amount of biodiversity as well as the development of several maritime activities in the fields of tourism, transportation, aquaculture and product processing. The famous bay has a number of popular islands and beaches, which are constantly visited by tourists and travelers coming to Nha Trang.\nNha Trang Bay is considered one of the most precious nature models in the whole world due to its exotic and rare ecosystem found beneath the tropical sea. The renowned bay has about 10 Salangane islands. Every year, the Khanh Hoa Province earns millions of dollars just from the exploitation of bird’s nest in Salangane. The underwater surface of the bay is also home to 350 types of corals, 190 kinds of fishes, crustaceans, mulluscas, sea grasses, weeds etc.\nKnown as one of the 29 most stunning bays throughout the world, Nha Trang Bay is home to 19 islands including Mun Island, Mieu Island, Tre Island, Tam Island and Yen Island. Because the water in the bay is warm all year round, the bay is ideal for different water sports activities like scuba diving, swimming and snorkeling, which brings more and more people from different parts of the world and every corner of the country. One special adventurous activity that you can try to witness the superb view of the bay is the 20-minute balloon ride at a height of 150 meters.\nHon Mun Island is home to several Salangane caves that can be seen from your boat. Traveling using a glass-bottomed boat lets you witness the beautiful corals underwater. In 2001, Hon Mun Protected Area was the first sea reservation zone to be established in the country, with a total area of 160 square kilometers covering several nearby islands such as Hon Tre (the largest island), Hon Tam, Hon Cau, Hon Vung, Hon Rom, Hon Noc and Hon Mieu as well as the surrounding waters. This area is very popular because it is the most diversified coral reef in the country. Its international significance can’t be denied as the variety of corals is similar to the ones found in the India- Pacific ocean international coral reef center. The coral reef in the Hon Mun area comprises more than 340 kinds of corals out of 800 kinds around the world.\nOne great attraction in Nha Trang Bay is the Tri Nguyen Aquarium with its exceptional structure resembling the shape of an old pirate ship. The construction offers an underwater world feeling. From afar, the huge structure looks similar to a fossil ship draped in seaweeds and moss, stranded in the cape. The artificial lake inside is covered with a thick glass. Visitor will experience true excitement as you get surrounded by groupers, red snappers, sharks and eels over 1 meter in length. The largest island, Hon Tre, is now the host of the five-star sophisticated hotel resort Vinpearl Land.', ""Reef - The Whitsundays -\nThe Great Barrier Reef is said to be the\nlargest structure on earth ever created by living creatures.\nThe Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area is 347 800 square\nkilometres in area ( an area bigger that the United Kingdom,\nHolland and Switzerland combined). It is the largest World\nHeritage Area and marine protected area in the world.\nThe reef contains over 2,900 reefs which includes 760 fringing\nreefs, and 300 coral cays.\nCoral - Great Barrier Reef\n|You can experience one the of the “7” wonders\nof the world with a Day Trip to one of the pontoons with underwater\nviewing platforms with optional Diving and Snorkelling or you\ncan experience the reef and islands on a Sailing and Diving\ncharter boat, “highly recommended”.\nThe Great Barrier Reef is the world’s largest and most complex expanse\nof living corals reefs supporting varied forms of marine life.

It is approximately 348,700 square kilometres\nin area and approximately 2,300 kilometres long, running from just\nnorth of Bundaberg to the tip of the Cape York Peninsula. The reef\ncontains over 2,900 reefs which includes 760 fringing reefs, and\n300 coral cays. There are also 618 continental islands, which were\nonce part of the mainland. As the world's largest coral reef ecosystem\nthe Great Barrier Reef is home to approximately:- 1,500 species\nof fish 400 species of corals 4,000 species of molluscs 500 species\nof seaweed 215 species of birds 16 species of sea snake 6 species\nof sea turtle and some of the largest populations of dugong in\n||WHAT FISH IS THAT ?\nWith over 1500 species of fish on the reef the answer to this question is not\nan easy one. The use of identification books and underwater cards can be useful\nin identifying commonly encountered species. Body and mouth shape are often\nthe best key features in identifying the type of fish. The reef fish section\nof the marine biology manual will outline the features of the mostcommonly\nencoungered families of fish. Aim to learn the name of just one fish every\ntime you visit the reef, and you will quickly know the most commonly encountered\n|ARE WE GOING TO SEE ANY SHARKS ?\nIf you see a shark while visiting the reef, consider yourself very lucky as sharks\nare not frequently encountered by visitors. Of those which are seen the most\ncommonly encountered are the white tip reef and black tip reef sharks. Easily\nidentified by the white markings on the tips of the dorsal fins, they are often\nfound resting upon the sea floor. Like most sharks white tip's are extremely\ntimid and won't stay long around divers. Most sharks found on the reef are\nfish eaters and therefore pose no threat to visitors. Do not harass or block\noff a shark's exit as they may attack out of fear.\n|WHAT ABOUT STINGERS ?\nThe box jellyfish is found in the coastal waters of North Queensland during summer\nmonths (October to March). Visitors wishing to swim during this period should\nonly do so in protective swimming enclosures or wear protective clothing. The\nbox jellyfish is a coastal species and is not found out on the reef, but they\ncan sometimes be found around islands close to the mainland. Other stingers\nthat are sometimes encountered on the reef include the irukandji and blue bottle.\nBoth can cause a nasty sting, Vinegar can used on both box jellyfish and irukandji\nstings but not on blue bottle stings. For blue bottles use cold water and ice.\n|WHY ISN'T CORAL VERY COLOURFUL ?\nMost visitors to the reef comment that the coral isn't very colourful as they\nare used to seeing brightly coloured images in books and on television. Natural\nwhite light is made up of all the colours of the rainbow; underwater, these\ncolours are filtered at different depths with red and yellow disappearing first.\nThis gives the reef a predominantly blue/green appearance. Photographs and\nvideo are taken using lights to show the true colours of the reef. So the colours\nare there, it's just that you need white light to see them. This is why night\ndiving on the reef is so spectacular.\n|WHAT ARE CORALS ?\nCoral are made up of a thin layer of living animals called polyps, which secrete\na chalky, limestone skeleton as they grow. Coral colonies grow as the polyps\ndivide and multiply in a process known as budding. In addition to catching\nplanktonic prey with their tentacles corals also derive nourishment from simple\nsingle celled algae called zooxanthellae (pronounced zoo-zan-thelly). living\nwithin their tissues. Like all plants, zooxanthellae photosynthesize, producing\nnutrients from the suns energy which are used by the polyp for its own nutrition.\nCorals with zooxanthellae are able to lay down limestone skeletons up to three\ntimes faster than those corals without.\n|WHAT TYPE OF CORAL IS THAT ?\nTrying to identify particular species of coral is very difficult. What makes\nit so difficult is that one type of coral may appear as a branching form in\ncalm water and look like a plate coral in another area. In many cases it is\nthe environmental conditions, such as wave action, light levels and the amount\nof sediment in the water, that influence coral colony shape. The easiest way\nto identify corals is by their appearance * boulder * branching * plate * table\n* vase * bushy * solitary\nWHAT ABOUT CORAL SPAWNING ?\nEvery year over one third of the reef's 350 species of coral reproduce sexually\nduring a mass spawning event. The majority of inner reefs spawn around November\nwith the outer reefs spawning later in December. Spawning always takes place\nat night, and follows any time up to six days after the full moon. Eggs and sperm\nare released into the water where they eventually combine to form a free swimming\nplanktonic larval stage.\nWHY IS THE REEF SO FAR OFFSHORE ?\nMost of the Great Barrier Reef is located off the mainland of Queensland. Corals\nneed clear waters which are low in nutrients. They cannot tolerate freshwater\nor nutrients carried in the water run-off from the mainland. That is why the\nmost diverse and abundant corals grow offshore where the environmental conditions\nare more suitable.\nWHAT IS THE WATER CLARITY GOING TO BE\nThe clarity of water on the reef is determined by a combination of the amount\nof sediment and the amount of phytoplankton in the water. Sediment becomes suspended\ndue to increased water motion caused by tide changes, high winds and storms.\nPhytoplankton are the microscopic plants that drift around in the water. They\nare more numerous in areas where the nutrient levels of the water are higher\nparticularly around coastal reefs which receive nutrient rich runoff from the\n|ARE WE GOING TO SEE\nANY WHALES ?\nWhales are normally encountered during the winter months when they migrate up\nto the reef from Antarctic waters to mate and give birth. One of the most spectacular\nvisitors during this period is the Humpback. They are seen in the shallow coastal\nwaters of the Great Barrier Reef ranging from Hervey Bay to\nPort Douglas. Whale watching is conducted by a number of tourist operators through\nthese areas. The Minke is another species of whale seen during winter, particularly\naround the Ribbon Reef area. The smallest whales, the dolphins can be seen all\nyear round in most parts of the reef. * What about Crown-of-Thorns Starfish?\nThe cause of Crown of Thorn Starfish outbreaks is still the focus of a lot of\nresearch and debate. Increased nutrients from the mainland and effects due to\nEl Nino are all being investigated as is the possibility that it is a naturally\noccurring event. Crown of Thorns starfish may actually serve to maintain coral\ndiversity on the reef by feeding on the fast growing species, that if left unchecked,\ncould dominate the reef.\n|WHERE CAN WE GO FISHING ON THE REEF\nFishing is not allowed in green national park zones or pink preservation and\norange scientific zones. In other zones fishing is allowed subject to Queensland\nfisheries restrictions. Legal sizes, closed seasons and catch quotas also apply\nto a variety of fish and shellfish. The following animals are totally protected:\nwhales, porpoises, dolphins, dugong and turtles, clam, trumpet and helmet shells,\nfemale crabs all grouper and cod over 1.2 metres. What about the weather? In\ngeneral the average passenger is not so much concerned with the weather as they\nare with how it will influence their day at the reef. Therefore an answer should\nbe given in reference to their concerns eg.sea sickness, water clarity, and the\ncolour of the reef. Whats that slick? When good growth conditions exist, blooms\nof a simple floating algae called Trichodesmium are often confused with oil and\ncoral spawn slicks. Blooms can be easily identified by their rusty brown colour\nas they occur in wind rows along the surface of the water. Slicks of coral spawn\ngenerally do not last more than two days after coral spawning. Any oil spill\nshould be immeditely reported to the local maritime authority.\nWhitsunday Islands - Airlie Beach - Queensland""]"	['<urn:uuid:5edeb899-fdbd-4deb-948d-d217f1df6db0>', '<urn:uuid:eba993c1-fc2b-4020-8952-763be1f6f97c>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-01T23:46:40.222380	13	47	2156

In the same way, the wrong type of fuel can wreak havoc.\nSo in today’s post, we’re reviewing how hearing loss can occur, what part of your ear may be affected by our diet and what your diet should look like (and what it shouldn’t) to help you prevent hearing loss.\nThe ear is made of 3 parts, the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear. The inner ear is called the cochlear and it is this part of the ear that houses the hearing organ. The cochlea is live and filled with different types of fluid. The balance of the chemicals in these fluids is essential to the function of the ear.\nEven the slightest changes to the fluid, the blood supply that provides nutrients to the cochlea and changes in our diet may damage the cochlea, causing hearing loss. As such, your overall cardiac health may be linked to how well or how poorly you hear.\nHigh cholesterol diets can increase your risk of heart disease, cancer and chronic disease. But can it cause hearing loss? Research suggests it can. High cholesterol levels can cause a build-up of the fatty deposits in the blood vessels of your body. This build-up is called ‘plaque’ and sits inside the walls of your blood vessels which can restrict the blood supply to vital organs, including the cochlear.\nThe cochlea contains a web of delicate blood vessels that provide stability and nutrients. The difficulty in assessing the extent to which the blood vessels are affected is the location of the cochlea itself. It is deeply embedded in the temporal bone.\nThis makes the diagnosis of hearing loss or viewing the blood vessel damage very challenging. If you suffer from high coronary or heart disease and are worried about your hearing, contact your local, trusted audiologist and schedule a comprehensive hearing test today.\nResearch also suggests that tinnitus sufferers on a low-fat diet generally experience less disturbance from their tinnitus compared to those on a high-fat diet.\nSalt adds so much joy to your food, but may also cause anguish to your body when used in excess. About a teaspoon or 5 grams of salt, a day is considered optimal. Australians, however, often consume twice as much salt than they need. Diets high in sodium are associated with high blood pressure, a risk factor for kidney and cardiovascular disease.\nIf your blood pressure is too high, it puts an unnecessary strain on your blood vessels and organs such as your heart, brain, and even eyes and ears. Considering the tiny blood vessels of the ear, any changes to the blood supply caused by spikes in blood pressure can result in a permanent hearing loss.\nClick here to find out why diabetics are twice as likely to suffer from hearing loss!\nWe’ve mentioned that the reduction of salt and fat in your diet can help reduce your risk for hearing loss, but what else can you do to support your hearing health? Research suggests that adding the following vitamins and minerals to your diet may help to keep hearing loss at bay!\n|Potassium||Potatoes, lima beans, tomatoes, spinach, apricots, raisins, bananas, melons, oranges, yogurt and low-fat milk|\n|Folic Acid||Fortified breakfast cereal, liver, spinach, broccoli and asparagus|\n|Omega 3||Flaxseed oil, krill oil, salmon, soybean oil, walnuts, sardines|\n|Zinc||Beef, pork and dark-meat chicken, cashews, almonds, peanuts, beans, split peas, lentils, oysters – and dark chocolate|\n|Magnesium||Bananas, artichokes, tomatoes, potatoes, spinach and broccoli|\nCalcium is the body’s building block for bones and encourages bone growth and formation. Since the ear houses the 3 smallest bones in the body, the incus, stapes and the malleus, your hearing may benefit from your calcium intake. When the tiny bones of the ear are healthy, the risk of hearing loss caused by damage to these structures is reduced. Calcium is also found in the fluid of the inner ear, the cochlea, and encourages optimal function of the hearing organ.\nPotassium is responsible for regulating the amount of fluid in your blood and body tissue. As mentioned above, the cochlea is filled with different types of fluid. In a healthy ear, these should be rich in potassium. It plays an important role in translating the sounds we hear into electrical impulses that the brain can understand. Naturally, when there are changes to the fluid of the cochlea, such as a drop in potassium, it may result in hearing loss.\nStudies have shown that a diet rich in potassium decreases the risk of hearing loss. As you age, the amount of potassium in your bodies drops, which may increase the likelihood and severity of hearing loss as you get older. Eating a healthy, well-balanced diet rich in potassium may be beneficial to many aspects of your health and can positively affect your hearing.\nThis wonder vitamin plays an active role in keeping our immune system strong. This greatly reduces the chances of catching viruses, which is one of many possible causes of hearing loss. Having a strong immune response could help protect your ears from hearing loss brought on through illness and help the body fight intruders. You can support a healthy immune system with a diet that includes a good amount of zinc.\nFolic acid is yet another vital building block in your body. It helps form new cells and to maintain a steady growth of cells in the inner ear. It also prevents damage to the DNA of our cells and promotes healthy bodily functions.\nLow folic acid levels have been linked to an increased risk of hearing loss. Studies examining the causes of sudden hearing loss (SSHL) found that “folate levels were found to be significantly lower in SSHL patients than [in those without hearing loss]”. It appears that a diet high in folic acid, may promote a healthy cell function and in doing so, reduces the risk for developing hearing loss.\nMagnesium is a nutrient that has many functions in the body. It aids nerve and muscle function, as well as blood sugar level and blood pressure regulation, amongst other things. A drop in magnesium levels can ‘suffocate’ the cochlea. This happens because the blood vessels shrink as a result of magnesium deficiency, halting the delivery of oxygen to the inner ear. The resulting damage can lead to sudden, permanent hearing loss.\nStudies have demonstrated that the administration of magnesium in individuals exposed to excessive noise (in combination with vitamin A, E and C) can reduce the amount of damage to the delicate hair cells in the cochlea and reduce the measured hearing loss. The scientists behind this research suggest that magnesium forms a protective layer over the hair cells, making them stronger and reducing the likelihood of hearing loss. It is assumed that a healthy intake of magnesium can help stimulate and encourage a healthy hearing.\nIt is well known that Omega 3 has excellent anti-inflammatory properties, but how does this help our hearing? A recent study which monitored the hearing health of its participants over a five year period showed that those who ate fish at least twice a week were 40 per cent less likely to have hearing loss compared to people who ate fish less than once a week. Scientists still argue why this is the case.\nBy looking after your body and loading your diet with a well-balanced array of healthy foods, you can do your part to keep your hearing health in check. Whilst there is no one magical nutrient responsible for ‘super hearing’, when you nourish your body with a good balance of vitamins and minerals, your hearing will be better off in the long run and can work to its optimal capacity.\nWe recommend consulting with your GP before adding any vitamins or supplements to your diet to improve your hearing.

And they are among the saltiest.Pizza, pickles and deli meats are among the foods Americans crave, yet their health “minuses” include lots of excess sodium. Ditto for canned soups, salted snacks, fresh and processed chicken, cheese, burgers and sandwiches.On average, Americans are consuming about 3,400 milligrams of sodium daily, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s 50 percent more than the maximum 2,300 milligrams of table salt per day – about a teaspoon – that experts recommend. Ideally, it should be no more than 1,500 milligrams per day for most adults.Too much salt in their diet leaves many people more vulnerable to high blood pressure, stroke and heart attack. The higher their blood pressure, the greater the strain on their heart, arteries, kidneys and brain. Salt often is a culprit in heart and kidney disease and can lead to those organs’ failure.Bidwell“Salt attracts water, so when we consume too much salt, we hang on to more water than we need,” said Dr. Josie Bidwell, associate professor of nursing and preventive medicine at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. “That increases our blood volume, which makes our blood pressure go up. The more volume you have, the harder your heart has to work to pump it around.”As much as 75 to 80 percent of sodium in a person’s diet comes from packaged and processed foods, said Bidwell, who runs UMMC’s wellness clinic.“We used to think that it was table salt, and of course we want to limit that, but if we can change the amount of processed or packaged foods we start with, then adding a little salt during the cooking process is not the big problem.”Face it: People won’t eat food if it’s not appealing.“If you don’t add seasonings to food, it doesn’t taste good,” Bidwell said. “Our taste buds have become accustomed to wanting things that are super-salty, so we over-salt. But if you need to reduce your salt, first work on cutting down on processed and packaged things.”Cutting down on salt doesn’t mean cutting it out of your diet entirely, Bidwell said. Instead, make better choices.“Snack time at the office is a good opportunity,” she said. “Instead of reaching for something from the vending machine or eating a package of peanut butter crackers, change to a piece of fruit and a little handful of nuts.”Set some reasonable goals when it comes to salt consumption. If you’re eating fast food seven days a week, she said, cut it down to five – and choose more wisely what you order.“If you normally get a burger and fries, that’s a ton of salt and calories,” she said. “Get maybe one of them, and instead of the other, pick a side salad or a fruit cup.”She recommends a few more tips: • When possible, choose fresh foods, not processed foods that almost always are highly salty. • Use the nutrition facts label to check the amount of sodium in a food or drink. Look for foods with 5 percent Daily Value or less of sodium. A DV of 20 percent or more is high. When cooking grains, don’t add salt. • Look for foods labeled “low sodium” or “no salt added.” • Load up on foods with no salt, such as fresh fruits like apples, oranges or bananas; fresh vegetables like spinach, carrots or broccoli; frozen vegetables without added butter or sauce; and canned vegetables with no salt added. • When cooking grains, don’t add salt. • Try one of the sodium-replacement salts available in grocery or discount stores that taste like salt but include potassium instead of sodium as a key ingredient. Experts say these replacements might actually help to lower blood pressure because of the helpful effects of potassium. If food comes with a seasoning packet, use only part of the packet. • Dilute salt by adding liquid to dishes like soups, stews, casseroles and other liquid-based dishes. Add fat to “absorb” the taste of the salt for most dishes. Or add bland foods such as potatoes, grains or bread, or replace salt with something tangy or sour, like lemon juice.

602	trying to save my houseplants need help what color light wavelengths do plants use	Plants need red and blue light wavelengths to grow properly. The blue wavelengths help foliage grow and thrive, while the red wavelengths support the development of flowers and fruit. Green wavelengths are not usable by plants - they are simply reflected off the plant's leaves, making them appear green. Plants require a full spectrum of warm and cool wavelengths that replicate sunlight.	['Regular LED (Light-emitting diode) lights provide some of the wavelengths needed by plants, but they do not offer the full spectrum of wavelengths necessary to grow healthy, happy plants.\nFor this reason, you must use LED grow lights, which provide the red and blue light spectrums that help plants grow.\nThe blue wavelengths help foliage grow and thrive, while the red wavelengths support the development of flowers and fruit.\nThe green wavelengths that are typically provided by household LED lights are not usable by plants.\nThey make plants look greener, but this is only because their green rays are reflected off the plant’s leaves.\nIf you want to grow plants using artificial lights of any kind, you must use bulbs that provide a full spectrum of warm and cool wavelengths that replicate those provided by the sun.\nThis article provides good guidance to help you use artificial light to grow plants indoors. Read on to learn more.\nImportant Light Source Guidelines To Add To Your Plant Care Regimen\nSunlight is the perfect light for plants. It has just the right balance of light wavelengths to help plants grow, bloom and set fruit.\nEven so, you can provide an excellent habitat to help your plants thrive in any room in your home or office through carefully selected and correctly used artificial light.\nChoose The Type(s) Of Lighting You Want\nWhen choosing indoor lighting for plants, you may wish to go with full spectrum fluorescent or full spectrum LED lighting, or you can mix and match.\nLED Lighting For Plants\nThere are many advantages to using full spectrum LED lights to grow plants. These bulbs are very energy efficient, offering cool, safe operation.\nThere are also many different types of LED light bulbs for use in various settings.\nWhile it is possible to calculate the amount of red and white wavelength of various common household LED light sources to produce to customize your plant setup, it’s better, easier, and safer to purchase and use LED grow lights.\nOne caveat, though, double-check to be sure the bulbs you buy really do provide a full spectrum of wavelengths.\nAlso, remember that some LED lights are sold as “plant lights” but only offer the green spectrum, making your plants look green – until they die.\nFluorescent Lighting For Plants\nFluorescent lighting is inexpensive and versatile.\nYou can buy handy CFL (Compact Fluorescent Light) bulbs that can be used in any light socket or get tube fixtures that are easy to hang anywhere.\nThe advantages of fluorescent lighting include cool and economical operation and a very long bulb life.\nIf you cannot find full spectrum fluorescent bulbs, you can use cool white bulbs, which also deliver a full spectrum of wavelengths.\nCFL vs. LED\nCompared with fluorescents, LED lighting also runs cool and is safe, efficient, and easy to use.\nIn addition, even though LED lighting may be a little more expensive to set up, bulb life is even longer than fluorescent lighting.\nOn the downside, LED lighting doesn’t cover as much area as fluorescent lighting.\nLED devices are often heavier than those designed to be used with fluorescent lighting, and for use in your living space, these receptacles may not be as attractive as those that can use CFL bulbs. [source]\nArtificial Lighting Tips & Questions\n1. Get A Fast Affordable Start On Plant Lighting.\nYou can begin by simply replacing all of your regular light bulbs with CFL or LED bulbs.\nThen, add LED grow light bulbs or CFL bulbs to hanging lamps or table lamps to create a good growing space for individual or small groupings of potted plants.\nThis will help your plants grow and thrive, and it will also help you save energy and money.\n2. Examine Any Bulb You Plan To Buy Carefully.\nRemember to read the description of the bulb’s wavelength carefully.\nIf you buy “plant bulbs” or “plant lights” without double-checking, you may end up with a green wavelength LED light or a green tinted incandescent light.\n3. Always Pay Attention To The Safe Wattage Range Of Lamps And Sockets.\nRemember that you can use LED or CFL bulbs in any household light fixture but stay within the wattage range.\n4. Set Up A Proper Growing Space To Get Your Garden Started.\nIf you want to do some serious gardening indoors or start seeds indoors to transfer to your spring and summer garden, you’ll need a space equipped with hanging tube fixtures that provide concentrated light to your plants.\n5. Use Halogen Or Incandescent Lights Carefully Or Not At All.\nYou can include halogen and incandescent lights in your plant lighting mix, but they don’t provide full spectrum lighting\nThey burn hot and use a lot of energy, so, overall, you’re better off leaving them out.\n6. Mix & Match Bulbs Successfully.\nIf you decide to include incandescent and halogen lighting in the mix, be sure to position cool bulbs (e.g., CFL and LED) closer to plants.\nPlace hot incandescent or halogen bulbs in higher settings to provide light to the room without burning your plants.\n7. Use Reflective Surfaces To Increase Lighting.\nMirrors and white walls can increase the light output of your fixtures and brighten your home or office.\nIn a grow room, reflective materials, such as Mylar, will greatly increase light output.\n8. Make Use Of A Timer To Provide The Right Amount Of Light.\nIt can be hard to remember when to turn your plant lights on and off. Set up timers or use a “Smart” program to provide your plants with 16 hours of light and 8 hours of dark daily.\nWhy Use Full Spectrum Artificial Light For Plants?\nWhen you use full spectrum LED or CFL lights in your home gardening ventures, you can improve the health of your existing plants and make it possible to expand your indoor gardening efforts to even the darkest corners of your home or office setting.\nAdding artificial light improves both the quality and the quantity of light available to your plants and you.\nPlants are not the only entities that benefit from full spectrum lighting. All living beings can benefit from exposure to abundant, natural spectrum light—even you!

627	rainbow cave and house rock which natural force shaped them both	Both Rainbow Cave and House Rock were shaped by natural erosion processes, but in different ways. Rainbow Cave was formed when waves, wind, ice and water eroded the softer Chapel Member of the Munising Formation of Sandstone. House Rock, which stands about 10 meters tall on the crater rim, shows evidence of erosion and weathering, as demonstrated by its surface exposure age dates being younger than the crater's 49,000-year formation age.	"['PIRO: The “Painted” Pictured Rocks\nFigure 1. Pictured Rocks Cliffs Photograph by: Beth Dondit\nWhy are the Pictured Rocks the “Pictured Rocks?” What caused the colors to form on the cliffs? How did it happen?\nThe Pictured Rocks cliffs span approximately 15 miles from the Beaver Basin west to Munising, MI. The cliffs are constantly being weathered and eroded by the powerful forces of the water, waves, wind and ice. A sea cave can form when a softer rock is affected by erosion. The Chapel Member of the Munising Formation of Sandstone is this softer layer. Waves, wind, etc. have slowly eroded “Rainbow Cave” over a long period of time. Inside this sea cave, you will see many colors along the rock walls/ceiling. The staining or nature’s painting, has left quite a canvas inside this cave. When groundwater seeps through porous rocks, the minerals in the groundwater also seep through, and leave behind colors to mark their presence. Green and blue colors come from copper; black from manganese, or tannins originating in the streams; orange and red come from iron; and white from limonite. Water follows the path of least resistance, and travels downwards (gravity). The water table here is higher than Lake Superior, thus water is moving to the lowest point possible. This is very evident inside the “Rainbow Cave.”\nFigure 2.

The field camp was run under the NASA Lunar Science Institute and headed by Dr. David Kring of the Lunar and Planetary Institute.\nTwenty-two of us are spread out between three Chevy Suburbans, and it\'s strange having legroom on a geology expedition. Not that there\'s far to go. We are camped out in an RV park a mere 5.5 miles from our field site: Barringer Meteorite Crater. This is the first day of the first ever Meteor Crater Field Camp, and we are making the first trip first thing in the morning to my first visit to any crater, ever. Everyone\'s ready to get started, and we don\'t have long to wait. Our first stop is approximately fifteen feet outside the gates of our campsite, and we step out of the vehicles after realizing the stop wasn\'t because of a forgotten water bottle or notebook.\nAt 5.5 miles out there\'s not much of the crater to see and so we huddle around Dr. Kring, our fearless leader. He asks us to imagine standing at this exact spot 49,000 years ago* as Meteor Crater formed. ""What would you see?"" he asks us. Slowly we find our voices: A streak of light and a flash. A fireball. Wind whipping across the plains. A massive volume of ejected material rushing toward you. Then nothing because you are dead.\nWe learn we wouldn\'t even last that long. At this distance the shock wave would reach you in less than a second, turning you inside out before the wind and heat simultaneously flash-cooked your body as it tumbled away in pieces with the desert sage. Oh well. Someone luckier and further away would have seen quite the show.\n49,000 years later, as we pile back into the vans, it\'s mostly sunny and warming past 50°F on the high desert plains of Arizona.\n[*On the basis of thermoluminescence, 26Al, 10Be, and 36Cl studies, it\'s generally agreed that Meteor Crater formed 48 to 49 thousand years ago. More recently, updated 36Cl reference material argues for an older age of 60 to 65 thousand years.]\nOn the docket for our first day at the crater is a 3.7 kilometer (2.3 mile) hike along the rim, about 1.8 km clockwise before lunch, then retracing our steps counterclockwise. There\'s House Rock (also known as Monument Rock), the largest (intact) boulder on the crater rim at about 10 meters tall. Pile on two more House Rocks and you\'d have a reasonable estimate of the meteorite diameter. And maybe at one time there really was another House Rock or two on top. Surface exposure age dates from the top of House Rock are younger than the 49,000-year formation age.\nIt wouldn\'t be surprising if House Rock had initially been covered by ejecta. Erosion and weathering is evident everywhere at the crater. A gully running downslope beneath the crater museum rapidly cut through three layers of authigenic breccia, both exposing and halfway eroding a projectile fragment over a two year period. The breccias are so friable that when we later head into the crater, we aren\'t allowed to touch or even go near the left side of the gully where the projectile is exposed.\nOn our counterclockwise hike back we generate a little erosion of our own by scrambling down the crater wall a bit from House Rock to see something (else) awesome. We start out on Kaibab limestone on the crater rim and walk down through Moenkopi formation, and end up back at Kaibab. The top slice of bread in the Kaibab-Moenkopi-Kaibab sandwich is ejected, overturned Kaibab. The bottom slice is in-situ Kaibab. And the meaty Moenkopi center is where it gets interesting. Look at the photo below. Both members of the Moenkopi are visible here. The pale reddish brown Wupatki (at left) is a massive sandstone underlying the dark, reddish brown fissile siltstone called the Moqui. The surrounding pale/tan blocks are dominantly Kaibab (limestone/dolostone), though most shown here are loose boulders.\nOriginally horizontal beds were uplifted during impact and now dip away from the crater. In the center of the above image, the Moqui member -- the surface unit at the time -- takes a sharp turn and winds up parallel to the crater wall. This is an exposed portion of a fold hinge, where a flap of target material was overturned to create an inverted stratigraphic sequence.\nThere\'s so much more to see at the crater. Sand fields, tear faults, shocked quartz...and we\'re still just getting started!']"	['<urn:uuid:19a45410-c030-465f-97e0-8555075f9967>', '<urn:uuid:9c5b2d08-de9c-4b8c-b9ea-9cb1e6a138a4>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-01T22:36:12.692263	11	71	1364
493	old pictures stored how long display safe	Based on personal experience, daguerreotypes from the 19th century as well as contemporary ones have been safely displayed continuously for over 10 years without showing any signs of deterioration or change. This evidence contradicts claims about daguerreotypes being light sensitive. In fact, daguerreotypes are among the most stable photographic objects, provided their housings are intact to prevent atmospheric pollutants from reacting with the silver surface and the housings themselves are not contributing to deterioration.	['Quoted in full:\nThe recent article in the Scientific American magazine paints a picture of doom and destruction for daguerreian art pieces. Of course this is disconcerting for collectors and institutions that have significant investment in these beautiful objects. The author implies that degradation surrounding some Southworth and Hawes daguerreotypes in the Young America exhibition can be applied to all daguerreotypes when he writes “The vanishing images suggested that any daguerreotype could spontaneously crumble.” This sky-is-falling statement in my opinion does not represent the majority of daguerreotypes.\nLets review this issue.\nApproximately 160 Southworth and Hawes daguerreotypes were exhibited over two years at three institutions. Five plates changed significantly with an obscuring white haze, and supposedly 25 plates changed slightly. The majority of the plates did not change at all.\nFrom personal experience I can tell you that I have 19th century daguerreotypes as well as my own daguerreotypes that have been on continuous display on my studio for 10+ years with no sign of change. This is my argument against the claim that daguerreotypes are light sensitive.\nWhat every collector or institution must know is Southworth and Hawes plates have a very unique storage history contrary to the norm. The great majority of S&H images that remain were plates retained by the studio stored completely unsealed in plate boxes. They were sold in this condition through Holman’s bookshop in the 1930’s. and early 40’s. As they migrated to private collectors and institutions they were sealed using what were thought of at the time to be proper conservation materials. A typical preservation package used by the George Eastman House from the mid-1970’s to 1999 consisted of 4-ply buffered board with a paper binding tape, and a buffered die cut paper mat separating the plate from the glass. The buffering agent is 3% calcium carbonate to provide an alkali reserve of ph 8.5.\nA significant case in point. In 1999, a trove of Southworth and Hawes daguerreotypes were discovered in the garage of David Feigenbaum after his death. A team of conservation professionals from the George Eastman House were asked to prepare the plates for auction at Sotheby’s. Over 200 plates were housed in the materials described above. A collector who purchased a Southworth and Hawes daguerreotype from the David Feigenbaum sale brought it to me to replace the conservation housing with an 19th century brass mat, preserver and case. I retained the die-cut buffered mat and backing board. Soon after, I made a daguerreotype that I felt wasn’t good enough to frame in my own passe-partout housing design, but I wanted to preserve it as I had made it in collaboration with my friend Irv Pobboravsky. I placed the daguerreotype behind glass using the die-cut mat I retained from the Feigenbaum sale held together with spring clips and placed it in a zip-lock back. It was stored in the dark for approximately four years. It now has a very definite obscuring white haze adjacent to the mat. While this is not a scientific experiment, it does provide a significant observation and cause to question if the housing materials are contributing to the deterioration of the plates.\nI have experienced the “white haze” phenomena on other of my contemporary images as well as on 19th century images that have been in contact with buffered board. What is good for the conservation of paper, ie alkaline buffering, is not necessarily good for daguerreotypes.\nIn reviewing the conservation efforts for the Young America Exhibition I learned that plates were not removed from their buffered mat board and die cut preservation packages. These were placed intact into extremely well sealed secondary housings incorporating shallow copper pans to act as pollutant scavengers. A complete overview of the conservation for this exhibition can be found here.\nIf the buffered materials are a co-factor in the formation of “white-haze” deterioration it would explain why even with the best intentioned conservation, some plates still changed during exhibition. A questionable environment was enclosed within a stable one.\nThis remains to be explored and I hope to soon analyze the plate and mat from my example. I present this scenario as a possible alternative and/or co-factor to the silver-chloride scenario presented in the Scientific American article.\nIn closing, I would say that daguerreotypes are among the most stable of photographic objects providing the housings are intact to prevent atmospheric pollutants from reacting with the silver surface and that the housings themselves are not contributing to the problem. The nature of the mechanism of deterioration particular to a small percentage of Southworth and Hawes daguerreotypes is not yet fully understood. The findings reported in the Scientific American article should not prevent us from exhibiting, collecting or enjoying these amazing photographs. It is prudent, as has been shown by the Young America exhibition, to accurately document any daguerreotype intended for exhibition and carefully monitor it at regular intervals to note any changes.\nPresident of the Daguerreian Society\nThis certainly adds a new wrinkle to the previous Scientific American article.

1378	prevention techniques treatment options torn acl sports injury	To prevent ACL injuries, athletes should perform training drills focusing on balance, jumping, power and agility, along with specific exercises like focused stretches, leg raises, and sidesteps with Theraband resistance bands. For treatment, options include rehabilitation with training and exercises taking several months, or ACL surgery to replace the torn ligament in severe cases. Initial treatment should always include rest, ice, and proper wrapping of the knee.	['LOS ANGELES–(BUSINESS WIRE)–#ACLinjury–With spring upon us and summer not too far behind, April has been\nproclaimed Youth Sports Month – a time to encourage youngsters to get\nout and play while also providing important guidance on how to avoid\ninjury and stay in the game.\nOne injury of particular concern is the number of anterior cruciate\nligament (ACL) tears found among today’s youths. The ACL is one of the\nmajor ligaments that provides stability to the knee joint; and although\ncommonly talked about in professional sports, this injury is even more\noften found in athletes under the age of 25. In fact, the number of ACL\ninjuries, particularly among high school students, has risen\ndramatically over the past 20 years. Researchers have found the overall\nincidence of ACL tears among 6- to 18-year-old patients has increased by\n2.3 percent per year, and the rate of ACL tears surgically reconstructed\nhas increased by 3 percent per year over the study period.\n“ACL injuries have become a youth sports epidemic and are the No. 1\nsports injury we operate on at our outpatient surgical center,” said\nJennifer Beck, M.D., associate director of the Center for Sports\nMedicine at the Orthopaedic Institute for Children. “The injury\nis most common in sports that involve sudden changes of direction – such\nas football and soccer – but fortunately there are some basic things\nathletes can do to lessen the chance of injury.”\nAccording to Dr. Beck, most ACL injuries are not the result of contact\nwith another player but rather occur during sudden twisting motions\n(such as when the feet are planted one way and the knees are turned\nanother way) or when landing from a jump. Factors that can contribute to\nACL injuries include biomechanical factors such as muscle strength and\nleg alignment as well as sport technique and preparation.\nDr. Beck says that athletes can reduce their risk of ACL injuries by\nperforming training drills that require balance, jumping, power and\nagility. “Drills such as these also help improve neuromuscular\nconditioning and muscular reactions and have shown to ultimately\ndecrease the risk of ACL injury.” Other suggested exercise includes a\nvariety of focused stretches (calf, hamstring, quadriceps, etc.) leg\nraises, leg lifts, prone hip extensions and sidesteps with a Theraband\nresistance band. A complete list and more information on ACL sprains and\ntears can be found at http://ortho-institute.org/education/patient-library/anterior-cruciate-ligament-sprain.\nWhile ACL injuries are on the rise, it is not the only potential hazard\nfor youth who are gearing up for another season of sports … and many of\nthe basic tips provided to all young athletes apply to ACL injury\nprevention as well. The OIC Center for Sports Medicine advises parents\nand coaches to work together with young athletes to ensure that players:\nDon’t skip the warm-ups. It is important to warm up properly,\nincluding stretching and jogging. Preparing the muscles for more\nstrenuous exercise can help prevent strains and sprains (including ACL\ninjury) while improving performance.\nDrink enough fluids. Dehydration can make muscles more\nsusceptible to damage. Players should drink water before, during, and\nafter practice and games.\nUse proper equipment. There have been many advances through the\nyears in sports equipment that not only help performance but lessen\nthe risk of injury. Make sure that athletes have the right shoes, pads\nand helmets before they take to the field.\nNever play through pain. It is never okay for young athletes to\nplay through pain or fatigue. Persistent pain should not be ignored.\nLeft untreated simple injuries can become complicated conditions.\n“We want children to have fun, but it is also important to have a common\nsense approach to playing and to not ignore injury,” says Dr. Beck.\n“While rest, ice and ibuprofen can help reduce basic soreness, if pain\npersists parents should contact a physician. Failure to address a sports\ninjury properly and promptly can lead to lifelong problems.”\nThe Orthopaedic Institute for Children is home to Los Angeles’ premier\nCenter for Sports Medicine for children. Its state-of-the-art facility\nis staffed by a specially trained team of sports medicine physicians,\npediatric orthopaedic surgeons, nurse practitioners, medical assistants,\nathletic trainers and physical therapists all focused on helping each\nchild return to his or her sport activities as quickly and safely as\npossible with the shortest possible recovery time.\nAbout Orthopaedic Institute for Children\nOrthopaedic Institute for Children (OIC) was founded in 1911 as Los\nAngeles Orthopaedic Hospital. Focused solely on musculoskeletal\nconditions in children, OIC receives 60,000 patient visits each year. In\nalliance with UCLA Health and with the support of the OIC Foundation, we\nadvance pediatric orthopaedics worldwide through outstanding patient\ncare, medical education and research. Our locations in downtown Los\nAngeles, Santa Monica, Westwood and Calexico treat the full spectrum of\npediatric orthopaedic disorders and injuries.

It joins the lower and upper knee bones. Therefore, an ACL injury refers to an tear or an injury of any kind on the anterior cruciate ligament that occurs commonly during sporting events (such as football, tennis, basketball, skiing and so on) when a sportsperson stops and changes direction abruptly, slows downs or lands after a jump. Such movements could cause the knee to twist, bend sideways or backwards thus cause the injury.\nFurthermore, torn ACL could also be caused by knee collision with moving objects, from occupational injuries or falls on staircases or ladders. This injury could be mild or severe depending on how it happened. However, most the ACL injuries do not occur because of collision.\nIn terms or vulnerability, female athletes are more vulnerable to the condition, especially when they compete in sports/athletics. Similarly, people who are also above the age of 40 are more prone to the condition.\nThe symptoms experienced in case ACL injury could vary in magnitude depending on the extent of the tear sustained. However, the most common ones include the following:\n- A pop sound on the knee at the time of the injury\n- Pain on the back and outside of the torn knee\n- Swelling of the torn knee within a few hours that could indicate internal bleeding in the knee and in severe cases, swelling might be immediate.\n- Knee buckles and instability\n- Pain during movement, limited movement or both\nDiagnosis involves questions on how the how the torn ACL happened, your past medical history as well as a physical examination of the affected knee and the unaffected one. Doctors often check stability, tenderness and movement of the knee. An X-ray may be used to determine if there is any bone fractures or an MRI scan which can show any damages on tendons and muscles on your knee. Some doctors often resort to Arthroscopy.\nTreatment of ACL Injuries\nIn case of a torn ACL, the first recommended step is to receive first aid, which involves resting the knee, icing it and gently wrapping a bandage around it. The leg should then be elevated at a level higher than the heart. Medical care can then be sought to avoid the problem becoming a long lasting one.\nDepending on the extent of the ACL injury, various treatment methods may be recommended. The common methods used include the following:\n- Rehabilitation – Training and exercising which might take several months until your knee regains stability and strength.\n- ACL surgery to replace the torn ligament, which will be followed with exercises to rehabilitate your knee. ACL surgery is recommended in severe cases. Some of the surgical grafting procedures used in dealing with ACL injury include patellartendon autograft, Quadriceps tendon autograft, Hamstring tendon autograft and Allograft.\nFinally, while under rehabilitation, you should be careful to ensure you do not get hurt again as this could worsen the situation.\nTips to Reduce Torn ACL\nSince ACL injury is common among sportsperson, to avoid chances of this injury, always ensure that you do not wear sporting shoes, which have cheats if you are playing a sport with much contact, use flat shoes (or low healed), and avoid sports that have much twisting and contact.']	['<urn:uuid:2256f0be-08f4-4fc2-b2c1-de5f91ca9e23>', '<urn:uuid:603460b0-afeb-453a-987f-55368f96c562>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-02T11:45:30.494741	8	67	1384
1294	as strength coach specializing blood flow restriction bfr training what pressure levels safe and effective for bfr cuffs	The recommended pressure level for BFR training is equivalent to 50% estimated arterial pressure. Previous research has successfully used pressure levels of 120-130% brachial systolic blood pressure (bSBP). The lower end of this pressure range is recommended for wider cuffs, while narrower cuffs can be applied using the higher pressure value. It's important to note that higher pressures do not necessarily lead to better training adaptations and can actually impair exercise performance and increase adverse health risks.	['Blood Flow Restriction Training (BFR) is becoming an increasingly popular training method among athletes with high training loads e.g swimmers, gymnasts, rugby players, MMA athletes, boxers and powerlifters.\nInitially, this training method was adopted by powerlifters and bodybuilders to reduce joint stress whilst increasing muscle mass and strength.\nCompetitive athletes across an array of sporting disciplines can benefit from BFR training as it represents a potent stimulus for gains in muscle mass and strength whilst limiting exposure to heavy loads and therefore contributing to improved training longevity.\nIn this article we’ll cover:\n- The effectiveness of BFR using evidence from the scientific literature.\n2. Describe the potential mechanisms that underpin the effectiveness of BFR training.\n3. Present the considerations boxers need to make before employing BFR training.\n4. How we use BFR at Boxing Science\n5. The main factors when incorporating BFR into a boxer’s training regime.\nHow to perform Blood Flow Restriction Training?\nThe best way to perform Blood Flow Restriction is using SAGA Fitness BFR cuffs.\nCheck out their upper and lower-limb cuffs at SAGA fitness, save 10% discount by using ‘boxingscience’.\nWHAT IS BLOOD FLOW RESTRICTION TRAINING?\nBFR training involves compressing the proximal area of a muscle, usually with specialised bands (known as pneumatic restriction cuffs) that can quantify the amount of pressure being applied to the area (1,2,3).\nThis compression restricts blood flow, mainly venous but some arterial, and in combination with strength training stimulates a cascade of intracellular signals that facilitate gains in muscle mass and strength.\nThere are two types of BFR training frequently used in the scientific literature:\nLow Load/Intensity BFR training: Isolation/single joint exercises using light loads between 20-30% 1RM (1).\nHigh Load/Intensity BFR: Compound/Multi joint lifts using heavier loads >70% 1RM (4,5,6).\nThe focus of this article will be predominantly on low load/intensity BFR training as this is the method we use most frequently with our boxers.\nEFFECTIVENESS OF BFR\nLow load BFR training has been shown to induce muscle hypertrophy and strength improvements in both general (7) and sporting populations (8).\nThese interventions are usually programmed as single-joint exercises such as bicep curls and leg extensions.\nIn combination with conventional, unrestricted high load strength training, low load BFR has been demonstrated as an effective complementary training method for augmenting gains in muscle size and strength (9).\nAs such BFR is considered a safe and effective alternative to training at higher intensities, particularly for accessory type exercises (10).\nThis represents a major upside of BFR training for athletes who have high training loads and perform repetitive actions that stress the same joints over and over e.g swimmers, rowers, boxers and endurance runners.\nHOW DOES BFR WORK?\nThere has been much discussion about how BFR stimulates muscle hypertrophy and gains in muscle strength.\nIt should be noted that gains in muscle strength as a result of BFR are usually a consequence of muscle hypertrophy from this training method (9).\nBFR & MUSCLE HYPERTROPHY\nMuscle Activity: Light loaded BFR training has been shown to elicit superior magnitudes of muscle activity compared to unrestricted training (11).\nIncreases in muscle activity enhance tension within the muscle, providing the basis for hypertrophy.\nMuscle Protein Synthesis: Using 20% 1RM with blood flow restriction has shown to significantly increase muscle protein synthesis to a magnitude similar to that of heavier loads following a bout of resistance training (12, 13).\nCellular Swelling: This is said to occur as a result of blood pooling, accumulation of metabolites as a result of the restricted blood flow (14) and reactive hyperaemia that occurs on the release of pressure.\nIntra-cellular swelling is a key trigger for anabolic-signalling pathways which facilitate muscle growth.\nIncreased Metabolic Stress: Metabolic stress is a key driver for increases in muscle mass. Metabolic stress may be defined as an exercise-induced accumulation of metabolites, particularly lactate, inorganic phosphate and H+ (18, 19).\nCurrent research suggests that metabolic stress is heightened with BFR training techniques (15).\nIncreased Muscle Fibre Recruitment: Due to the accumulation of metabolites associated with blood pooling, it is suggested that this may increase the recruitment of fast twitch muscle fibers.\nThis blood pooling contributes to slow twitch muscle fibre fatigue and as a result greater fast twitch fibre recruitment during the set, according to Heneman’s size principle.\nUsually with lighter loads it is difficult to activate and develop type 2, fast-twitch, muscle fibers due to the low force demands.\nBFR seems to increase the force demands of a set even with lighter loads, therefore recruiting more type 2 muscle fibers (16, 25)\nBENEFITS OF BFR FOR BOXERS\nWe know boxers are among the hardest training athletes out there in terms of the intensity and volume of training.\nWhen in camp, boxers will throw thousands of punches throughout the training week.\nThough high punching volumes are an essential part of a boxer’s training, this can impart significant strain on the joints and muscles that are recruited repetitively.\nPunching the bags, pads and even a sparring opponent pre-disposes these athletes to chronic irritation of the hands, wrists, elbows and shoulders. This can often be reported as tenderness and pain on impact in these joints, potentially impairing the athletes capacity to train maximally.\nTherefore, as strength and conditioning coaches we aim to avoid placing further, unnecessary stress on these joints wherever possible.\nBFR is one method we can use to minimise joint stress whilst providing a potent stimulus for hypertrophy and strength development.\nWHEN TO USE?\nThough BFR is a well-established training method, it should be used in certain circumstances with boxers.\nGaining muscle in the wrong places at the wrong time is something we should try and avoid.\nHere are examples of when BFR can be beneficial for a boxer:\nGeneral Preparation: We have employed BFR with success in general prep phases when the athlete is returning to camp after a lengthy layoff, to help restore lost muscle mass and prepare him/her for more intense training phases.\nMoving Up: If aiming to move up in weight BFR is something to consider including.\nUsing BFR during light loaded sets will help maximise muscle fiber recruitment and in combination with contemporary S&C methods will contribute to your explosiveness in the ring.\nRehabilitation from Injury: Losses in muscle mass and a lack of neurological stimulation, as a result of injury can be detrimental to an athletes strength levels.\nMaintaining muscle strength is essential for boxers to maximise their potential for high rates of force development (RFD).\nAs mentioned previously, the mechanisms that influence hypertrophy from the use of BFR can indirectly enhance dynamic muscle strength (9).\nA common method of retaining strength qualities if recovering from a joint injury is the use of handcuff and ankle weights.\nAdding BFR to these sets enables us to use light loads but recruit additional muscle fibres which promote hypertrophy and improvements in strength.\nMoreover, BFR training enables us to do this without having to use high volumes and minimises the risk of causing further injury to the afflicted limb.\nAccuracy: Despite using elastic bands in the past, we would strongly recommend purchasing a set of Airbands if intending to use BFR training.\nIt is important to monitor the pressure applied to the athlete and with elastic bands this is impossible.\nAirband’s moderate the pressure accurately through an app on your smartphone/tablet, so you can perform BFR with precision.\nVisit the Airbands website here.\nPressure: It is important to understand that more pressure does not necessarily equate to better training adaptations.\nHigh pressures can impair exercise performance and increase adverse health risks.\nA Pressure level equivalent to 50% estimated arterial pressure has been previously recommended (17).\nPrevious research has applied pressure relative to the individual’s brachial systolic blood pressure or bSBP (20, 21).\n120% – 130% bSBP have been employed successfully in previous publications (22, 23)\nThe lower end of this pressure range is recommended for wider cuffs whereas narrower cuffs can be applied using the higher pressure value (17).\nExercise Selection: At Boxing Science we tend to use BFR with single joint, accessory exercises such as bicep curls, tricep extensions and lateral raises.\nThis is mainly because compound lifts such as squats with BFR may be too intense for athletes who have a relatively low strength training history such as boxers.\nMaintaining technical proficiency during sets of heavy compound movements, is very important, especially with boxers.\nIncorporating BFR during these sets may negatively affect the boxers’ ability to maintain solid posture throughout due to the level of discomfort experienced and thereof increase the chances of injury.\nAdditionally, supporting evidence surrounding the use of BFR with high load, compound movements is lacking.\nVolume: Another advantage of BFR training is that less volume is required with lighter loads to stimulate muscle hypertrophy when using BFR compared to unrestricted training.\nLoenneke and colleagues (25) suggest that sets to failure may be more beneficial than the commonly used four set protocol (first set of 30 repetitions followed by 3 sets of 15 repetitions) when implementing BFR training.\nAt Boxing Science, however, we frequently prescribe a four set protocol of 30/15/15/Failure. This high volume is usually matched with a relatively low intensity, usually around 20-30% 1RM.\nThis is because boxers are usually not accustomed to achieving such high levels of muscular fatigue as associated with repeated sets to failure using BFR.\nAdditionally, injured boxers or those carrying niggles will struggle to tolerate the mechanical stress needed to repeatedly reach failure during sets of BFR.\nStage Of Training Camp: The use of BFR is most appropriate during general preparation phases where the athlete has a specific goal of gaining muscle mass.\nPerforming substantial volumes of BFR during periods of high sparring loads may lead to impaired training performance as a result of exposing the muscle cell to high levels of metabolic stress and, subsequently fatigue.\nSimilarly, BFR too close to competition is likely to have an excessive fatiguing effect.\nBlood Flow restriction is an effective method for developing muscle mass and improving/maintaining muscle strength in combination with traditional resistance training whilst minimising the risk of chronic joint tendinopathies and inflammation due to the use of lighter loads. (9, 24, 26, 27, 28).\nThe main mechanisms in which BFR promotes hypertrophic adaptations using lighter relative loads than that of traditional hypertrophy training include: Increased cellular swelling, increased metabolic stress and enhanced muscle fiber recruitment.\nAt Boxing Science, we use BFR training techniques in cases where the athlete is returning from a lengthy layoff, is looking to move up in weight class or is recovering from an injury.\nImportant considerations to address when implementing BFR with boxers include Accuracy of the device used, the degree of pressure applied and the exercises used with BFR.\nAdditional consideration needs to be given to the volume implemented with athletes unfamiliar with BFR training (e.g boxers) and the stage of training camp BFR is performed in.\n- Cook, S.B., Clark, B.C. and Ploutz-Snyder, L.L., 2007.

1339	what main parts metacognitive awareness learning process include	Metacognitive awareness has three parts: knowledge about our learning selves, an understanding of the task demands and necessary strategies to complete it, and the means to monitor learning and self-regulate.	['The true purpose of getting an education is to apprentice students into becoming their own teachers. We want them to be self-directed, lifelong learners , and to have curiosity about the world. We want them to have the tools they need to formulate their own questions, pursue meaningful answers, and through metacognition, be aware of their own learning in the process. (Hattie, Fisher and Frey, 2017, p176)\nHattie, Fisher and Frey mention three phases of learning – surface, deep and transfer. My previous two blogs explored the first two phases of learning: surface and deep. The final phase is that of transfer. In mathematics, this phase occurs when students are able to make connections among mathematical understandings and then use those understandings to solve problems in unfamiliar situations, while being very aware of what they are doing. Because learning is cyclical, transfer occurs all the time.\nThe authors use the example of Linda who understood the mechanics of mathematics (surface learning mixed with a little bit of deep learning) but had no idea how to apply that knowledge to real world contexts.\nLinda reminds me very much of myself when I attended secondary school and continually battled with the subject of maths. I loved it, particularly the challenge of the discipline but was extremely frustrated in that I did not know how to apply what I had learned to different situations or real world contexts. I also constantly questioned why I had to learn certain things, such as sine, cos and tan. I was never shown how trigonometry is used in contexts outside of school. Relevancy is a major condition of transfer which is basically answering the questions, “Why do I need to learn this and when will I ever use it?”\nLearning becomes more meaningful when learners see what they’re learning as being more meaningful in their own lives.\nHattie, Fisher and Frey state that it is also extremely important that teacher knows the learner developmentally and experientially in order to promote transfer of learning. The authors recommend two stages of transfer: near and far. Near transfer occurs when a new situation is paired to a context that a student has already experienced. A great way for students to develop transfer learning is to consider similarities and differences between the new and a recently completed idea.\nUsing graphic organisers such as the Venn diagram can help students consider the similarities and differences.Hattie writes that comparing and contrasting new with old problems has an effect size of 1.23.\nThe leap is bigger for far transfer as the student has to make connections to more removed situations.\nHattie, Fisher and Frey mention a few things to consider when planning tasks for transfer. Tasks:\n- should be selected to encourage connections\n- should be of higher complexity with higher difficulty\n- may not have clear entry points\n- may have multiple steps\n- may not have one correct solution – students have to make judgments about the best solution and justify their thinking with evidence\n- incorporate maths ideas that can be applied in other learning areas\n- may take more than one lesson to solve\n- should have relevancy\n- should be developmentally appropriate.\nMetacognition, the ability to think about our thinking, promotes transfer learning. Palinscar (2013) described metacognitive awareness as having three parts:\n- knowledge about our learning selves\n- an understanding of the task demands and necessary strategies to complete it\n- the means to monitor learning and self-regulate\nTo develop metacognitive skills, students need to learn the art of self-questioning. Self-verbalisation and self-questioning have an effect size of 0.64. Self-questioning enables students to track their understanding and re-align when off target. Hattie recommends using pre-lesson questions (What are today’s goals?) and post-lesson questions (What was today’s goals?) to encourage metacognition.\nSelf-reflection is a follow-up technique after the lesson that encourages students to understand where they were and where they are now.\nRich class discussion promotes transfer learning. In mathematical discussions, students should be able to represent their thinking to others, pose questions, and engage in disagreements respectfully. The caveat is that it is not unrelated storytelling, random opinion sharing or teachers doing most of the talking. The teacher’s role is to use questioning to lift student thinking, press for evidence and have students make links amongst concepts.\nFor students to take the driver’s seat of their own learning, they need a sense of how the mathematics that they know is organised. Creating an organisational structure for mathematical knowledge is a powerful tool.\nPeer tutoring requires the tutor to connect what the tutee needs to learn to what the tutee already knows and understands. Peer tutoring has an effect size of 0.55 and works best when programs are structured, the tutor receive training and the tutor and tutee are of different ages. It allows the tutor to solidify his/her understanding and the tutee to improve their learning.\nGiving students opportunities to explore their own ways of using what they have learned is critical for transfer learning and should be woven into classroom life. Students should be continually challenged to develop projects and investigations across the school day.\nThis makes me think of a recent initiative being used in Queensland: Age Appropriate Pedagogies which encourages the use of a range and balance of pedagogical approaches in the classroom.\nThe conceptual framework includes six approaches to teaching and learning: event-based, project, explicit instruction, inquiry learning, play-based learning, direct teaching/instruction and a blended approach (Department of education and training, Qld Government). Only ever using one approach such as direct instruction will limit a student’s ability to transfer learning.\nProblem-solving teaching also encourages the transfer of mathematics learning and is different to a problem-solving process.\nIt is similar to the design thinking necessary for the new Australian Curriculum learning area of Technologies.\nProblem-solving teaching helps students engage in the process of determining the cause of a problem; using multiple perspectives to uncover issues; identifying, prioritising, and selecting alternatives for a solution; designing an intervention plan; and evaluating the outcomes. (Hattie, Fisher and Frey, 2017, p193)\nDesign challenges for any age group can be identified by listening to students’ wonderings about the world around them. An example may be designing a school garden to grow vegetables for cooking.\nReciprocal teaching also assists students to transform their mathematical thinking and is a literacy strategy that develops comprehension of the mathematical problem. Students work collaboratively to build their understanding of texts. There are four stages and students are encouraged to keep a record of their thinking and work. :\n- predicting – students use knowledge of mathematics and the information provided to predict what is happening and to decide what mathematics may be needed to solve the problem.\n- clarifying – students make lists of information that they might need to solve the problem – unfamiliar vocabulary, known facts and necessary information to solve the problem.\n- solving – students use their problem-solving strategies to find one or more solutions to the problem and are encouraged to use multiple representations.\n- summarising – this is a time for individual self-reflection that includes justifying the solution, reflecting on the effectiveness of the selected strategies and evaluating their participation.\nStudents need the opportunity to apply what they have learned in mathematics to unfamiliar situations but it would be nearly impossible to transfer without surface and deep learning. Transfer learning should not be left to chance and requires caring teachers to deliberately design opportunities by knowing their students and using effective strategies.\nStay tuned. My blogs have slowed down as I am back at work but I have one more blog for this text. It will look at the last chapter – Assessment, feedback and meeting the needs of all learners and will be posted within the next couple of weeks.']	['<urn:uuid:e5e72d6a-8dec-4ea3-b592-ef46fda869ce>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-02T11:45:30.494741	8	30	1302

['Each month, the PR Committee interviews an ESO Fellow (FESO) to feature in the newsletter.\nTo qualify as an FESO, members must demonstrate scientific quality and a willingness to actively volunteer in ESO. There are no age requirements, but FESO must meet minimum standards. FESO receive additional benefits, including participation in the Council of Fellows. Visit our website for more information on how to distinguish yourself as a FESO.\nWe hope you will enjoy getting to know the Fellows who participate in the 2019 interview series and thank them in advance for taking the time to share with our readers. The series began with Alastair Webb, University of Oxford, UK, next we interviewed Anita Arsovska, University Ss Cyril and Methodius, Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia.\nThis month, we present Francesco Corea, Stroke and Neurology Units, Ospedale San Giovanni Battista Foligno, Italy. He is an active FESO, Chair of the ESO Social Media Committee and a member of the Telestroke Committee.\nWhat are your main fields of interest in stroke medicine and research?\nMy interest on Stroke started in the late 90s during Medical School. Initially, the main work was in the acute phase. I had the privilege to be involved in pivotal RCTs from Ancrod to Alteplase. This brought me from initial deep frustration to the final exciting success. Later once Stroke Units became the standard of care I found new challenges in the rehab field. I was always interested in innovative technologies from diagnostics to therapy. Internet and telemedicine where promising tools for Stroke doctors in the 2000s. Many were still skeptical that either could become a high-profile medical subject. Now working with e-health is more and more a reality.\nWhat is the role of ESO in facilitating and promoting the projects you are coordinating or where you are involved?\nThe working market in Europe changed dramatically in the last decade.The shortage of physicians with specific profiles lead to the emergence of a new generation of dynamic Stroke doctors. The chance of being involved in ESO was thereby crucial in my career.\nThe place for Stroke professionals to share practice standards and update their competence is ESO (Summer/Winter Schools, main ESOC). In ESO, I found the right contacts to develop an efficient regional Telestroke network. This would have been impossible otherwise. The ESO international panel of experts on Telestroke succeeded to produce a unique recommendation paper on the topic (1). This lead to encourage the standardization in the field at continental and national levels.\nRecently ESO members joined their efforts in the Social Media committee. What role do social media play in Stroke medicine? We have tried to understand the drivers of interest on the web with an Infodemiology analysis. What are the effects of global Stroke campaigns on internet public ? (look for our presentation in Milan ESOC19). Where else it would be possible other than in ESO ?\n(1) Hubert, Gordian J, Gustavo Santo, Geert Vanhooren, Bojana Zvan, Silvia Tur Campos, Andrey Alasheev, Sònia Abilleira, and Francesco Corea. “Recommendations on Telestroke in Europe.” European Stroke Journal, (October 2018). doi:10.1177/2396987318806718.\nWhat do you expect from ESO in the future to support research?\nThe best strategy to find resources for stroke is to invest in a renewed care pact. To gain the attention not only of traditional mass media but also of the web public. The access to stroke care and research funding is not homogeneous in large areas of Europe. Further efforts must be made for a renewed alliance between health care professionals and citizens. This will empower the community that supports the fight against stroke in Europe.\nWhat do you think a mentor should do to support the projects and the career of a mentee and, conversely, what should a mentee expect from a mentor?\nLong time ago I participated in a consensus (2) suggesting a model for harmonizing Stroke training in Europe. The topic of mentoring and environment was central. Seen the wide curricula needed for Stroke experts (e.g.: from diagnostics, to acute phase and rehabilitation) the team-work model was the main solution guaranteeing results. We wrote: “Whatever the main background the most important aim is to ensure that the stroke trainee is competent in practicing Stroke medicine and that he or she can function effectively as a Stroke specialist leading a hospital stroke team”. As a mentee generally I expected to receive solid knowledge, as a mentor I encourage to build organizational skills to develop an effective leader.\n(2) Corea F, Gunther A, Kwan J, Petzold A, Debette S et Al.

531	How do wave power plants impact marine ecosystems and what are their effects on global pollution compared to other energy sources?	Wave power plants can negatively impact marine ecosystems by occupying natural habitats, endangering marine life with moving parts, risking electrocution through transmission systems, and potentially affecting water quality with maintenance chemicals like lubricants. However, compared to other energy sources, wave power is environmentally friendly since it doesn't emit greenhouse gases or toxins, unlike fossil fuels which contributed to 9 million pollution-related deaths in 2015. Wave power plants also have a small spatial footprint, typically occupying less than half a square mile for a 30MW plant.	"['pollution might just be humanity’s most pressing problem.\nMore than 9 million deaths were linked to “polluted air, water and soil,” in 2015, according to an explosive new report published in The Lancet, a UK medical journal. To provide some context, this means that pollution accounted for 16 percent of all deaths worldwide, “three times more deaths than from AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined and 15 times more than from all wars and other forms of violence,” according to the report’s executive summary. This figure, as the study’s authors point out, may in fact be conservative, and could be millions higher, “because the impact of many pollutants are poorly understood.”\nThe study drew from the work done in previous studies that “show how pollution is tied to a wider range of diseases than previously thought,” including asthma, cancer, heart and lung disease, and neurological disorders. The vast majority of deaths – a full 92 percent, according to the report – took place in undeveloped or developing countries, a shocking statistic that nevertheless still provides some hope: the study’s authors say that “the big improvements that have been made in developed nations in recent decades show that beating pollution is a winnable battle if there is the political will.”\nOther highlights from the study:\n- Deaths from air pollution “are on track to double by 2050” in southeast Asia;\n- The costs of pollution are $4.6 trillion each year, according to the study’s estimate – “equivalent to more than 6% of global GDP”;\n- Of the various forms of pollution, toxic air contributed the greatest number of deaths, at 7.4 million, water pollution (this means sewage, most often) resulted in 1.8 million deaths, and workplace pollution, “including exposure to toxins, carcinogens and secondhand tobacco smoke,” resulted in 800,000 deaths.\n- Although the highest rates of pollution death are found among small developing countries, it’s India, with 2.5 million deaths, and China, with 1.8 million, that have the greatest number of deaths linked to pollution. Both Russia and the US are in the top ten as well.\nAccording to lead author Dr. Philip Landrigan, a pediatrician and professor of environmental medicine and global health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, stricter regulation of toxic chemicals can often benefit economies, which “puts the lie to what we hear that controlling pollution is going to kill jobs.” As an example, Landrigan cites the passage in the US of the Clean Air Act, which has brought air pollution levels down 70 percent in the intervening years, even as GDP has increased 250 percent.\n“Pollution is one of the great existential challenges of the Anthropocene era. Pollution endangers the stability of the Earth’s support systems and threatens the continuing survival of human societies.”\nThe Lancet Commission on pollution and health\nThe Lancet Commission on pollution and health\nThe study’s conclusions, along with a just-released report by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) which “found that costs [linked to climate change] may rise to as much as $35 billion per year by 2050,” are surfacing at a particularly transformative moment for the EPA – established the same year, 1970, that the Clean Air Act was amended to give the federal government much greater power to regulate chemical use. Administrator Scott Pruitt, who has not accepted scientific consensus around climate change, and who pressed President Donald Trump to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord, has “embarked on record-setting rollbacks,” which include “plans to repeal pollution in the nation’s waterways [and] delaying rules requiring fossil fuel companies to rein in leaks of methane and greenhouse gases.” Pruitt also refused to ban a farm pesticide, chlorpyrifos, that poses a health risk to children and farm workers, and that has already, since 2000, been banned from most household use. The list goes on: the EPA under Pruitt has moved to suppress research into – and even mention of – climate change, including removing references on its website, canceling public talks, and removing from advisory roles scientists who’ve received federal grants for studies, and politicizing the issue by creating “red team-blue team” exercises between scientists who doubt climate change and those who don’t. Such exercises create false equivalences on a topic that’s already got near-unanimous scientific consensus. Pruitt has also moved to repeal the Obama administration’s signature climate regulation, the Clean Power Plan, in an effort to bolster the coal industry, long in decline due to the rise of natural gas and renewables, and has tasked his agency to respond to permit requests in six months or fewer, which means big, complicated projects with difficult-to-predict outcomes could get the greenlight without receiving thorough vetting.\nWhat this amounts to, in the eyes of many folks on the left, is a full-on assault on the environment, but Pruitt and co. see themselves as reformers, trimming away at bureaucratic fat and demanding the science around disputed chemicals be utterly airtight before acting to regulate, rather than allowing what Dr. Nancy Beck, one of Pruitt’s top deputies, calls “phantom risks” to bottleneck industry. It’s a typically Republican approach, maybe more destructively so in this administration than in previous ones, although this may just be because there’s more to destroy: the Obama administration significantly expanded the role of the EPA in its efforts to address climate change, and also took a rather-safe-than-sorry approach to chemical regulation which, in light of The Lancet report, may prove to be the right one. As Wendy Cleland-Hamnett, who until her retirement last month was “the agency’s top official overseeing pesticides and toxic chemicals,” asserts,\nYou are never going to have 100 percent certainty on anything, but when you have a chemical that evidence points to is causing fatalities, you err more on the side of taking some action, as opposed to ‘Let’s wait and spend some more time and try to get the science entirely certain,’ which it hardly ever gets to be.\nThe New York Times’s The Daily podcast posted a fantastic episode on Tuesday about the perceptions each side of the EPA debate has of itself, which you can find here.\nA new study summarizing observations “across 63 German nature reserves” reveals a disturbing 76 percent decline in flying insect biomass.\n- The study’s authors aren’t sure why this happened, but speculate that pesticide use in adjacent areas, coupled with climate change, has played a significant role.\n- The authors also believe their findings to “be representative of much of Europe and other areas of the globe.”\n- A key quote: “Lack of insects is very likely to be detrimental to the entire ecosystem…insects play a crucial role in ecosystems, being responsible for plant pollination and nutrient recycling as well as acting as a food source for animals such as birds, amphibians, reptiles, bats and small animals.”\nAn 11-year-old motivated by Flint’s still-polluted (honestly, how?) water invented a lead-detecting device.\n- From NPR’s description of the device: “there is a disposable cartridge containing chemically treated carbon nanotube arrays, an Arduino-based signal processor with a Bluetooth attachment, and a smartphone app that can display the results.”\n- What we’d like to know: how does an 11-year-old get her hands on carbon nanotubes?\nChina’s new ban on 24 categories of recyclables and solid waste could mean that much of what we recycle ends up in the trash.\n- Why? “China is the dominant market for recycled plastic,” according to Christian Cole in The Conversation. Here in the US, we export around 1.4 million tons of recycled plastic to China.\n- Double bonus: a tiny Montana company with links to Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke just landed a $300 million contract to rebuild Puerto Rico’s electrical infrastructure. Whitefish Energy Holdings, which had just two employees when Hurricane Maria made landfall last month in Puerto Rico, is based in Zinke’s hometown and owned by a friend of his.\nThe first-ever floating wind turbines—these five turbines off the coast of Scotland have the potential to power, at peak, up to 20,000 homes.\nAccording to a brand new study in Nature Communications, “water rose rapidly, in punctuated bursts, rather than gradually over time” during the last global warming period more than 10,000 years ago. The researchers “suggest[ed] these past events could be viewed as a kind of ‘analog’ for the future.”\n- Double bonus: a new story in The Atlantic, summarizing the results of a different study, would seem to confirm this: “Climate Change Will Bring Major Flooding to New York Every 5 Years”.\nLet’s end this on a positive note: here’s a livestream from the inside of a little penguin burrow.\nMakayla Esposito contributed to this report.\nheader image: ""pollution,"" possan / flickr', '17 Wave Power Advantages and Disadvantages Explained\nWave power is a renewable form of power that is generated from wave energy, using mechanical and electromagnetic technologies. Wave power advantages and disadvantages are; reliability, renewable operation, sustainability, fossil fuel independence, high potential, versatility, flexibility, consistency, minimal maintenance (advantages); cost, usability, weather susceptibility, technical limitations, transmission challenges, navigation problems, geographic constraints (disadvantages).\nThe characteristics of wave power and wave energy can be analyzed simultaneously, since wave power is a product of the conversion of wave energy.\nThis article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of wave power, as outlined below;\n-Advantages of Wave Power (and Wave Energy)\n-Disadvantages of Wave Power (and Wave Energy)\nAdvantages of Wave Power (and Wave Energy)\n1). Wave Power is Reliable\nWhen compared to other types of renewable energy, wave energy is significantly reliable.\nThis is because, unlike solar and wind intensity which change continuously with geographic conditions, wave motion occurs almost on a consistent basis.\nAnother way to describe the reliability of wave power is to state that, although the amount of wave energy (which is the source of wave power) may vary at different times, it is hardly ever equal to zero. There is an average amount of wave energy that is always available.\nWave power is reliable mainly because it does not depend on one variable. Unlike fossil fuels, solar and wind, wave energy originates from different sources, including solar heat, wind current, and Earth rotation.\nThe role of gravity in producing wave energy is yet another reason why it is reliable. Gravitational forces cause waves to occur in the ocean, as they try to balance the distribution of momentum across the water body, and to restore equilibrium after the disrupting effects of wind and solar radiation.\nThis settling effect and gravitational pull constantly works against the disrupting forces, leading to wave energy production. As a result, wave power can always be generated, although it may vary in magnitude at different times.\n2). Wave Power is Renewable\nWave power is renewable because wave energy is produced from solar, wind gravity and water, which are all renewable resources.\nWhile other types of power and energy are affected by changes like fuel availability and global warming, the oceans will always exist, as well as wind, gravity and solar radiation.\nWhat this implies is that electricity generation from wave energy will always be possible.\n3). Fossil Fuel Independence\nBecause wave power is renewable and reliable, it can serve as a substitute to fossil fuels, in its own capacity.\nIn spite of the advantages of wave power, it is an underdeveloped renewable resource . One of the reasons for this is the fact that adequate effort is yet to be made toward the development of wave energy technology.\nFossil fuels, on the other hand, constitute the most developed energy sector. Over-dependence on fossil fuels has economic and environmental disadvantages, which can be reduced by increasing the prominence and effectiveness of wave power.\nThe word ‘sustainable’ resonates with some important concepts, such as sustainability and sustainable development.\nThere are different reasons why wave power is sustainable. These reasons span across the three aspects of sustainability, which are environmental, social and economic.\nWave power is considered by many environment-friendly. The conversion of wave energy does not typically have any negative effects on water, soil or air quality.\nWave energy technologies and mechanisms are relatively simple, and do not emit any hazardous byproducts like greenhouse gases, toxins, and wastes .\nThe aesthetic impact and spatial footprint of wave power plants are also small, because these plants do not occupy large portions of the ocean, are often partially submerged.\nWhat this means is that wave power generation is a conservative practice. Estimates suggest that a 30MW wave power plant will occupy less than half square mile in the ocean.\nBecause it is mostly done offshore, wave power generation does not cause any notable damage to the land. This is unlike fossil fuels, which are known to cause significant soil and water pollution , or wind turbines and bioenergy plants that may cause aesthetic or air pollution.\nWhat all of these implies is that wave power is not a potential cause of environmental degradation.\nOther advantages such as reliability and renewable production, suggest that wave power is also sustainable and beneficial from social and economic perspectives.\n5). High Potential\nWave power has a relatively high potential because wave energy can be produced in large quantities .\nA vast amount of wave kinetic energy is generated in the oceans on a consistent basis. A reason for this is the vast scale of the oceans, and the magnitude of wind, solar and gravitational forces that act upon the ocean water.\nThe result is a very high energy density and energy efficiency of waves.\nAt the same time, the vastness of the oceans implies that wave energy can be accessed in all parts of the Earth. With availability, reliability, efficiency and high density, it can be said that the potential of wave power is significant.\nThis potential can be put to use simply by developing efficient technologies to harness wave energy and generate electricity.\n6). Versatility and Flexibility of Wave Power Generation and Consumption\nWave power generation is a versatile and flexible practice for different reasons.\nThe flexibility of wave power arises from the fact that it can be generated under a variety of conditions.\nThere are different devices, mechanisms and technologies for converting wave energy to wave power. These include barrages, longitudinal buoys, point absorbers, hydraulic piston systems, among others.\nVarious locations on the ocean are suitable for installing wave power plants, because wave energy is widely distributed across the water body.\nThis reduces the environmental impact of the wave power generation process, as plants can be installed in locations where there us minimal environmental effect, such as offshore areas.\nThe scale of wave power generation is flexible as well. It can be scaled up or down based on the size and design of the wave energy converter or power plant.\nIn terms of versatility, there is a variety of possible uses, of wave power. These include desalination, seawater pumping, and electricity generation.\nCompared to other power and energy sources, wave power is fairly consistent.\nThis is because wave energy is reliable, and its magnitude of output can be estimated with some accuracy.\nIt can therefore be said that wave power is ‘predictable’, because of the existence of a consistent, average amount of wave energy at all times.\n8). Wave Power Requires Minimal Maintenance\nBecause wave power plants are relatively simple in their design, the amount of maintenance required by these systems is much less than that which is required by other power plants.\nWhile some wave power plants are expensive to design, construct and install, there are various avenues where cost is minimized during the operational life of the plant.\nThese include hazard control, fuel usage and vandalism, among others.\nDisadvantages of Wave Power (and Wave Energy)\n1). Capital Cost of Wave Power Plants\nThe capital cost of generating wave power is relatively high, mainly because it is an underdeveloped sector.\nSince there have not been many wave power plant projects so far, the cost of acquiring equipment and carrying out the design and construction of these plants, is yet to be optimized.\nAlso, most wave power plants at this time, are built as a result of intensive research and development projects that are directed toward improving the efficiency and performance of wave power.\nSuch research and development projects add significant expense to the wave power generation effort.\nAlthough the power plants are relatively simple and require minimal maintenance, they are susceptible to corrosion as a result of prolonged exposure to seawater .\nThis means that corrosion-resistant materials must be used for building wave power plants, and these exposed metal parts must be assessed routinely to ensure that they are not damaged.\n2). Scale of Usability\nAlthough the amount of wave power produced by a plant depends directly on the size of the plant, there has not been much progress so far in terms of developing and implementing a practical wave power generation plant.\nExisting wave power plants are generally not yet capable of delivering utility-scale power for domestic use. This is a major setback, and limits the actual utilization of wave power.\n3). Wave Power Plants are Susceptible to Weather Hazards\nWave energy capture devices and other technologies used in wave power generation, are constantly exposed to the elements.\nThis exposure means that the equipment can get damaged or impaired due to harsh circumstances of operation.\nAsides the risk of damage, exposure of wave power equipment to harsh weather elements may reduce the performance of these equipment . The efficiency and scale of electricity generation are therefore inhibited at such times.\n4). Impact on the Marine Ecosystem\nIn order to capture wave energy and generate wave power, facilities must be installed on the ocean.\nHowever, this can have some negative effects on the biotic and abiotic components of the marine ecosystem .\nIn addition to occupying the natural habitat of marine species, wave power plants have moving parts that can be dangerous to marine life. Since water is a conductive material, there is also the risk of electrocution by transmission systems that are linked to wave power plants.\nChemicals used to operate and maintain the wave power equipment, such as lubricants, can also act as toxins, and may negatively affect water quality in the marine ecosystem.\n5). Technological Limitations of Wave Power Technology\nWave power also has some technological limitations.\nThese limitations arise solely from the fact that wave power technology is still a developing field and has not seen sufficient inputs and modifications to optimize its potential.\nAlso, because there are relatively few wave power systems that have been developed so far, there is not much practical information available to serve as a reference point for improvement.\nThe result of these conditions is a low technical-efficiency form of wave power, which does not meet the existing energy needs.\n6). Wave Power Transmission Challenges\nThere are two main reasons why wave power is often challenging to transmit.\nOne of these is the fact that wave power technology has some practical limitations. As a result, the transmission mechanism for electricity produced by wave power systems, has not been well developed.\nAnother reason is the obvious fact that wave power is produced offshore. Aside applications like water pumping where wave power is used offshore, it must be transmitted over long distances to the shore where it is needed.\nSuch long-distance transport of electricity across the ocean to the land is a notable challenge that affects the use of wave power.\n7). Sea Navigation may be Affected\nWave power facilities that have been installed offshore can affect navigation on the sea.\nThis is because such facilities may become obstacles within the travel route of marine vessels of various types.\nThe effect of such circumstances can be bad for the economy, as they could affect the marine economy by reducing the speed and sustainability of export and import, sea travel, tourism, fishing, and other marine-based activities.\n8). Noise Pollution May Occur\nThe equipment needed to convert wave energy to power, usually consist of moveable parts and generators.\nThese components can be loud when operating, and can cause significant, continuous noise pollution, that may affect inhabitants of the surrounding environs.\n9). Geographical Constraints of Wave Power Generation\nThere are geographical constraints involved in the generation and consumption of wave power.\nTo begin with, wave power generation varies with location. While wave energy is always being produced, not every marine region may produce enough energy to be harnessed in a profitable manner.\nThere may also be restrictions to the installation of wave power plants in some areas. This is especially the case in places where the marine sector is a notable aspect of the economy.\nLastly, wave power can only be beneficial where there are usable and reliable transmission schemes to send the electricity to where it will be used. In many coastal regions, such schemes and facilities are not available.\nWave power advantages and disadvantages are as follows;\nAdvantages of wave power are;\n- Wave Power is Reliable\n- Wave Power is Renewable\n- Fossil Fuel Independence\n- High Potential\n- Versatility and Flexibility of Wave Power Generation and Consumption\n- Wave Power Requires Minimal Maintenance\nDisadvantages of Wave Power are;\n- Capital Cost of Wave Power Plants\n- Scale of Usability\n- Wave Power Plants are Susceptible to Weather Hazards\n- Impact on the Marine Ecosystem\n- Technological Limitations of Wave Power Technology\n- Wave Power Transmission Challenges\n- Sea Navigation may be Affected\n- Noise Pollution May Occur\n- Geographical Constraints of Wave Power Generation\n1).

For example, suppose we allocate an IntBuffer with a capacity of 8:\nIntBuffer buffer = buffer.allocate(8);\nFigure 14-1 is a graphical representation of this buffer that I'll use to demonstrate various points. The slots in the buffer are numbered like arrays, starting with zero and ending with one less than the total capacity of the buffer.\nFigure 14-1. An empty buffer with capacity 8\nA buffer's capacity is fixed when it is first created. Buffers do not expand or contract to fit the amount of data placed in them. Trying to put more data into a buffer than it has room for causes a BufferOverflowException. This is a runtime exception, since overflowing the buffer normally indicates a program bug.\nAs well as a list of indexed values, a buffer also contains a pointer into that list called the position . The position is the index of the next slot in the buffer that will be read or written. Its value is somewhere between zero and one less than the buffer's capacity. It is initially set to 0 and incremented as data is written to or read from the buffer. You can get the buffer's current position with the position( ) method:\npublic final int position( )\nYou can also change the buffer's position by passing the new position to this position( ) method:\npublic final Buffer position(int new Position)\nHowever, most of the time you don't do this explicitly. Instead, the position is updated automatically as data is put into the buffer or retrieved from the buffer. For example, suppose we put the value 7 into the buffer in Figure 14-1:\nThe int 7 is put in the buffer at position 0, and the position is incremented to 1, as shown in Figure 14-2.\nFigure 14-2. A buffer with position 1\nNext, we'll put the value 65 in the buffer at position 1, so the position is incremented to 2:\nThe buffer is now in the state shown in Figure 14-3.\nFigure 14-3. A buffer with position 2\nWe'll then put three more values in so the buffer is in the state shown in Figure 14-4:\nbuffer.put(-32); buffer.put(116); buffer.put(65);\nFigure 14-4. A buffer with position 5\nNow it's time to read the data out of the buffer. There's a get( ) method that corresponds to the put( ) method. However, if we began getting from the current position, we'd read the zeros in slots 5, 6, and 7. Instead, first we rewind the buffer:\nThis doesn't change any of the data in the buffer, but it resets the position to 0, as shown in Figure 14-5.\nFigure 14-5. A rewound buffer with position 0\nNow it's ready to be read. Call the get( ) method once to read the zeroth value from the buffer:\nint i1 = buffer.get( );\nNow the variable i1 has the value 7, and the position has advanced to 1. The buffer is in the state shown in Figure 14-6.\nFigure 14-6. After reading one value\nWe can read the next values from the buffer the same way:\nint i2 = buffer.get( ); int i3 = buffer.get( ); int i4 = buffer.get( ); int i5 = buffer.get( );\nAfter this is done, the variable i2 has the value 65, i3 has the value -32, i4 has the value 116, and i5 has the value 65. The position has once again advanced to 5, as shown in Figure 14-7. It's important to note, however, that the data is still in the buffer. Unlike when writing data to a stream, the data hasn't vanished, even if we haven't stored what we read anywhere. It's possible to rewind the buffer and read it all again, any number of times. This capability turns out to be surprisingly useful.\nFigure 14-7. The buffer after it's been drained\nWe could read three more times from the buffer:\nint i6 = buffer.get( ); int i7 = buffer.get( ); int i8 = buffer.get( );\nAgain, although we never put anything in those slots, they are initialized to 0. After reading these bytes, the position will now be 8, equal to the capacity. Any further gets at this point without first rewinding the buffer will throw a BufferUnderflowException. This is a runtime exception that usually indicates a bug in the program.\nBesides position and capacity, each buffer also has a limit pointer. This is initially the same as the buffer's capacity. That is, a new, empty buffer with eight elements looks like Figure 14-8.\nFigure 14-8. A new buffer at position 0 with its limit equal to its capacity\nHowever, the limit can be set to a different value to keep the buffer from being read or written past a certain point. You can set the limit explicitly with this limit( ) method:\npublic final Buffer limit(int limit)\nThe no-args version returns the current limit:\npublic final int limit( )\nFor example, you might initialize a buffer with a very large capacity, perhaps 2 MB, to make room for any possible data you might want to put there. You'd fill the buffer with as much data as you have. Then, before draining the data out of the buffer, you'd set the limit to the size of the data actually stored. For example, if you put five bytes in the buffer, you could set the limit to 5 and then reset the position back to 0:\nThis would allow the process to retrieve elements 0 through 4 from the buffer, but if it tried to read elements 5 through 7, a BufferUnderflowException would be thrown. Before reading, you'd check that the position is less than the limit:\nwhile (buffer.position() < buffer.limit()) buffer.get( );\nIn practice, we don't manipulate the buffer quite so directly. Instead, we use the flip( ) and hasRemaining( ) methods:\npublic final Buffer flip( ) public final boolean hasRemaining( )\nThe flip( ) method sets the limit to the current position and then sets the position to 0. The hasRemaining( ) method returns true as long as the position is less than the limit. Using these two methods, we can make the code a little simpler and more generic:\nbuffer.flip( ); while (buffer.hasRemaining()) buffer.get( );\nFor example, suppose we put three bytes in the buffer from Figure 14-8, like this:\nbuffer.put(5); buffer.put(23); buffer.put(5);\nFigure 14-9 shows the result.\nFigure 14-9. A buffer at position 3 with capacity 8 and limit 8\nBefore draining the data out of it, the buffer is flipped, like so:\nThis puts it in the state shown in Figure 14-10: the data is the same, but now the position is 0 and the limit is 3. As data is read out of the buffer, the position advances, but the limit stays the same.\nFigure 14-10. A flipped buffer\nYou read from the buffer only as long as the current position is less than the limit:\nwhile (buffer.hasRemaining()) buffer.get( );\nAfter this loop completes, the buffer is in the state shown in Figure 14-11, with the limit equal to the position.\nFigure 14-11.

891	I live in London and heard that air pollution used to be really bad here in the past. How does historical London smog compare to the air pollution problems in modern American cities?	Historical London smog at the turn of the century was caused by water vapor condensing on soot particles in the air, leading to thousands of deaths from pneumonia-like diseases. Modern American cities face a different type of smog - photochemical smog produced when nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds from vehicle exhausts react with sunlight. This modern smog affects many major U.S. cities, from California to the mid-Atlantic seaboard, causing health problems like breathing difficulties, asthma, and reduced resistance to lung infections. According to recent data, about 120 million Americans live in areas with unhealthy air, with people of color being 60% more likely to be affected by unhealthy levels of air pollution.	"['This activity lets students create artificial ""smog"" in a jar. Teachers can use this module as an introduction to a planned visit from an air-quality scientist, or as the basis for extended discussions on the health problems associated with smog.\nRecognize that invisible air pollutants and weather conditions are involved in creating smog.\nUnderstand that not all air pollution is visible.\nAppreciate that human activities can cause air pollution.\nGuest presenters could include EPA air quality monitoring specialists, state or local air quality managers, chemists, laboratory technicians, or meteorologists.\nTARGET GRADE LEVEL\n3RD - 5TH\nVolatile Organic Compounds\nClean, dry, wide-mouth glass jar (such as a mayonnaise jar)\nHeavy aluminum foil\nTwo or three ice cubes\nStop watch or watch with a second hand\nThe expression ""smog"" was first used in ""Turn-of-the-Century"" London to describe a combination of ""smoke"" and ""fog"". Smog occurred when water vapor in the air condensed on small particles of soot in the air, forming small smog droplets. Thousands of Londoners died of pneumonia-like diseases due to the poisonous air.\nToday, smog is usually produced photochemically, when chemical pollutants in the air (notably nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds (VOC\'s) from automobile exhausts) are baked by the sun and react chemically. Ground-level ozone is produced by a combination of pollutants from many sources such as automobile exhausts, smokestacks, and fumes (VOC\'s) from chemical solvents like paint thinner or pesticides. When these smog-forming pollutants (called ""precursors"") are released into the air, they undergo chemical transformations and produce smog. Weather conditions, such as the lack of wind or a ""thermal inversion"", also cause smog to be trapped over a particular area.\nSmog causes health problems such as difficulty in breathing, asthma, reduced resistance to lung infections, colds, and eye irritation. The ozone in smog also can damage plants and trees, and the haze reduces visibility. This is particularly noticeable from mountains and other beautiful vistas such as National Parks.\nSevere smog and ground-level ozone problems exist in many major cities, including much of California from San Francisco to San Diego, the mid-Atlantic seaboard from Washington, DC to southern Maine, and over most major cities of the South and Midwest.\nWHAT TO DO\nExplain that the class will perform and experiment in which they will create artificial ""smog"" in a jar. Make sure that students understand that the jar is only a model, and models by nature are limited. For example, the purpose of this model is to illustrate the appearance and behavior of smog, not the composition or effects. It is important to understand that smog is not just a ""smoky fog"", but a specific phenomenon.\nSelect students to perform the experiment. Have them cut a strip of paper about 6 inches by 2 inches. Fold the strip in half and twist it into a rope.\nHave them make a snug lid for the jar out of a piece of aluminum foil. Shape a small depression in the foil lid to keep the ice cubes from sliding off. Carefully remove the foil and set it aside.\nHave the students put some water in the jar and swish it around to wet all the inside of the jar. Pour out the extra water.\nHave them light the paper ""rope"" with a match and drop it and the match into the damp jar. Put the foil lid back on the jar and seal it tightly. Put ice cubes on the lid to make it cold. (The ice cubes will make the water vapor in the jar condense.) You must do this step very quickly, perhaps with some assistance.\nTAKE NOTE! Be careful to supervise students using matches. DO NOT let anyone breathe the ""smog"" produced in the experiment, and when the experiment is completed, be sure to release the ""smog"" outside.\nAsk students to describe what they see in the jar. How is this like real smog? What conditions in the jar produced ""smog""? (Moisture plus soot particles from the burning matches plus carbon dioxide and other solvent vapors.)\nAsk the students if they have ever seen smog (not fog). Have they ever breathed air outside that smelled funny?\nSUGGESTED EXTENSIONS (OPTIONAL)\nHave students put a glass thermometer (not plastic) into the jar before they do the experiment. Have them record the temperature before proceeding to step 4. Have them record the temperature during step 5. Ask them to describe what the temperature did and why. Let them try it again without adding water.\nFor grades 7-12, assign students to small groups to answer the following questions and report back to class in two weeks. One group will consider the physical and chemical sciences and the other group will consider the health and ecological sciences. Each group should consider referring to several sources of information to answer the questions. Students could possibly interview the weather reporter or meteorologist at the local television or radio station or airport, or interviewing a health scientist from the city or county health department or air quality agency.\n(a) What conditions are necessary to produce smog in the air? Under what circumstances will these conditions exist in the city? How often are they likely? Can they be predicted in advance?\n(b) What are the health effects of smog on people? On plants and trees? Why doesn\'t everyone in the city get sick or have similar symptoms from smog? What types of people are most sensitive to smog?', 'In the summer of this year the American Lung Association released a report titled, “Driving to Clean Air: Health Benefits of Zero-Emission Cars and Electricity.” Typically a person might not expect that driving personal transportation could result in clean air because gas- and diesel-powered vehicles using internal combustion engines produce unhealthy emissions that are harmful to people and the planet. The report presents a new vision, however, one that foresees an America running on clean, renewable electricity and people driving electric vehicles, meaning all-electric vehicles. This vision is important for a number of reasons, some of which may be surprising to those who are unaware of the harm caused by gas- and diesel-powered vehicle emissions.\nWilliam Barrett, National Senior Director of Advocacy for Clean Air at the American Lung Association, answered some questions about the report for CleanTechnica.\nQ: The report says that switching to 100% zero-emission new passenger vehicles and clean, non-combustion electricity generation by 2050 could result in about 89,300 fewer premature human deaths by reducing air pollution. How did you arrive at that total, and which Americans are most vulnerable to premature death from air pollution exposure?\nA: The report includes a target of 100% zero-emission new passenger vehicle sales by 2035, coupled with non-combustion electricity generation. Cumulatively, the health benefits shown through our modeling of this scenario hit nearly 90,000 premature deaths avoided because the air pollution from these sources will be greatly reduced, though not eliminated fully. We used a series of modeling tools to arrive at these results, and for the health benefits specifically, we used the US EPA’s COBRA model for health benefits analysis.\nQ: The switch to electric vehicles and clean electricity could also provide $978 billion in public health benefits. What are the benefits, and are they distributed across the U.S. or are there areas that will benefit more?\nA: The $978 billion is a national figure, but based in more localized results. For example, the report highlights state-by-state findings that vary depending on local sources of pollution from power plants, refineries or the size of the on-road vehicle populations. Every state shows benefits from this transition to zero-emission technologies. The benefits range from reduced asthma attacks to premature deaths avoided because the air would be cleaner as the result of more non-combustion technologies in the vehicle and power sectors.\nQ: The aforementioned switch could result in 2.2 million fewer asthma attacks. What forms of air pollution linked with gas and diesel-powered vehicles cause asthma attacks? How dangerous are asthma attacks?\nA: Both particle pollution and ozone pollution associated with vehicle exhaust can contribute to asthma attacks. In fact, the Health Effects Institute’s latest comprehensive study on the health harms of transportation pollution re-confirmed the link between the onset of new asthma cases and traffic pollution exposure. Asthma attacks can result in the need for increased medication, emergency department visits, hospitalizations and can be fatal.\nQ: The report also mentions that the switch could result in 10.7 million fewer lost workdays. Why is that the case?\nA: By reducing harmful pollution, workers would be less likely to be too sick to work. Whether that is due to asthma flare ups, cardiovascular illness or other impacts, cleaning the air can remove a significant health risk from people’s daily lives. While not included in the report, there is also a significant benefit in terms of improving children’s health that could mean parents don’t need to stay home from when the child is too ill to attend school, camp or other activities.\nQ: Heart attacks, strokes, and lung cancer can be caused by exposure to air pollution. Is the general public aware of this fact and that the source of the air pollution is combusting fossil fuels such as gasoline, diesel fuel and coal?\nA: The goal for our report is to do just that — to draw attention to the existing health risks posed by the transportation and power sectors. We want people to see the report and make the link to the unacceptable risk posed by fossil fuels in our daily lives, and what the health-related benefits could be through a transition to non-combustion, zero-emission technologies that are healthier, less costly and more efficient in the long run.\nQ: In general, does American air pollution impact people of color more than white people?\nA: Yes, and our State of the Air 2023 report puts a very fine point on this. There are almost 120 million Americans living in a community impacted by unhealthy air, and the majority of those affected are people of color. We found that a person of color in the United States is over 60 percent more likely to live in a community impacted by unhealthy levels of ozone and/or particle pollution than a white person. When we look at the communities with a failing grade in all three of the State of the Air categories, a person of color is 3.7 times more likely than a white person to live with the most unhealthy air. The US EPA has also noted this disparity in that 72 million Americans live in close proximity to a major transportation/freight corridor, and those living along those routes are more exposed to harmful pollution, have lower incomes and are more likely to be people of color.\nA Final Note For Context\n89,300 Americans dying prematurely is quite obviously a huge number of lost lives. The good news is that this enormous loss of life can be prevented. For some context, a little over 58,000 American soldiers lost their lives in the Vietnam War. Air pollution from gas- and diesel-powered vehicles is typically not that visible except for some moments when the vehicles accelerate and it is possible to see a surge of smoke or soot from a vehicle’s tailpipe, bus vertical exhaust pipe, or tractor trailer “smoke stack.” We don’t see most of the tiny, microscopic particulate matter, aka soot, nitrogen oxides, or ozone and so we might not be that aware of it or even think about it. It’s there though, wherever gas and diesel vehicles are being operated, especially in large cities, on and near freeways, and in or near ports. Exposure to toxic exhaust takes quite a toll on human health and results in far too many premature deaths. Eventually, as clean, renewable electricity and electric vehicles replace fossil fuels and the vehicles that use them our nation will be healthier.\nHave a tip for CleanTechnica? Want to advertise?

762	life expectancy treatment options als huntington comparison	Both ALS and Huntington's disease are currently incurable, but they differ in progression and treatment approaches. ALS typically progresses over 3-5 years, leading to respiratory failure, with riluzole being the only FDA-approved drug that can extend survival by a few months. Treatment mainly focuses on symptom management through various therapies. Huntington's disease has a longer progression, typically appearing in midlife (ages 30-45) and lasting 10-25 years. Treatment options for Huntington's include experimental procedures like neurotransplantation and Axokine treatment, which shows some promise in protecting nerve cells, though these are still under investigation.	"[""Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal type of motor neuron disease. It is characterized by progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain. It's often called Lou Gehrig's disease, after a famous baseball player who died from the disease. ALS it is one of the most devastating of the disorders that affects the function of nerves and muscles.\nALS does not affect mental functioning or the senses (such as seeing or hearing), and it is not contagious. Currently, there is no cure for this disease.\nALS most commonly affects people of any racial or ethnic group between the ages of 40 and 70, although it can occur at a younger age.\nThere are 2 main types of ALS:\nSporadic. This is the most common form of ALS in the U.S., making up 90% to 95% of all cases. These cases occur randomly, without any known cause, and there is no family history of ALS .\nFamilial. This form of ALS affects a small amount of people and is thought to be inherited.\nWhat causes ALS?\nExperts do not know the cause of ALS. In a few cases, genetics is involved. ALS research is looking into possible environmental causes of ALS.\nWhat are the symptoms of ALS?\nWith ALS, you may first have weakness in a limb that develops over a matter of days or, more commonly, a few weeks. Then, several weeks to months later, weakness develops in another limb. Sometimes the initial problem can be one of slurred speech or trouble swallowing.\nAs ALS progresses, though, more and more symptoms are noticed. These are the most common symptoms of ALS:\nTwitching and cramping of muscles, especially those in the hands and feet\nLoss of motor control in the hands and arms\nImpairment in the use of the arms and legs\nTripping and falling\nUncontrollable periods of laughing or crying\nSlurred or thick speech and trouble in projecting the voice\nAs the disease progresses, symptoms may include:\nThe symptoms of ALS may look like other conditions or medical problems. Always see your healthcare provider for a diagnosis.\nHow is ALS diagnosed?\nThere is no specific test to diagnose ALS. Your healthcare provider will consider your medical history and symptoms and will do certain tests to rule out other conditions including:\nLab tests. These include blood and urine studies and thyroid functioning tests.\nMuscle or nerve biopsy. In this procedure, your doctor removes a sample of tissue or cells from the body and examines it under a microscope.\nSpinal tap (also called a lumbar puncture). In this test, your doctor places a special needle into the lower back, into the area around the spinal cord. There he or she can measure the pressure in the spinal canal and brain. Your doctor will remove a small amount of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and test it for an infection or other problems. CSF is the fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord.\nX-ray. This test uses invisible electromagnetic energy beams to produce images of internal tissues, bones, and organs onto film.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This procedure uses large magnets, radiofrequencies, and a computer to produce detailed images of organs and structures within the body.\nElectrodiagnostic tests, such as electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction study (NCS). These studies evaluate and diagnose disorders of the muscles and motor neurons. Your doctor inserts electrodes into the muscle, or places them on the skin overlying a muscle or muscle group to record electrical activity and muscle responses.\nWhat are the complications of ALS?\nThere is no cure for ALS. Over a period of 3 to 5 years, the disease will progress, making voluntary movements of arms and legs impossible. In time, you will need help with personal care, eating, and mobility. Movement of the diaphragm for breathing is also impaired. You may need a ventilator for breathing. Most people with ALS die from respiratory failure.\nHow is ALS treated?\nFor most people with ALS, the main treatment may involve the management of symptoms, This may include physical, occupational, speech, respiratory, and nutritional therapies. Some medicines, and heat or whirlpool therapy may help relieve muscle cramping. Exercise, in moderation, may help maintain muscle strength and function.\nThere is no cure and no proven treatment for ALS. However, the FDA approved the medicine riluzole. This is the first drug that has prolonged the survival of people with ALS.\nManaging the symptoms of ALS is a process that is challenging for you, your caregivers, and your medical team. However, it’s important to know that there are many community resources available for support and assistance.\nResearchers are conducting studies to increase their understanding of genes that may cause the disease, mechanisms that can trigger motor neurons to degenerate in ALS, and approaches to stop the progress leading to cell death.\nLiving with ALS\nALS will eventually lead to disability and death. Although your ability to move and breathe independently will be affected, your intelligence and ability to think is not. You and your family will work closely with your healthcare provider to manage symptoms as they develop. Use of the medicine may prolong your life by a few months, particularly if you have trouble swallowing. Discuss ways to make living spaces more accessible, and use of mobility devices and wheelchairs. It’s very important to discuss end-of-life decisions with your loved ones.\nWhen should I call my healthcare provider?\nIt is important that you keep your healthcare provider informed about new symptoms so she or he can recommend therapies and community resources appropriately. Most importantly, call your healthcare provider if you start to have trouble breathing.\nALS is a fatal motor neuron disease. It is characterized by progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain.\nALS affects voluntary control of arms and legs, and leads to trouble breathing.\nALS does not affect intelligence, thinking, seeing, or hearing.\nThere is no known cure for ALS.\nTreatment of ALS focuses on managing or minimizing symptoms as much as possible.\nTips to help you get the most from a visit to your healthcare provider:\nKnow the reason for your visit and what you want to happen.\nBefore your visit, write down questions you want answered.\nBring someone with you to help you ask questions and remember what your provider tells you.\nAt the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you.\nKnow why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed, and how it will help you. Also know what the side effects are.\nAsk if your condition can be treated in other ways.\nKnow why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean.\nKnow what to expect if you do not take the medicine or have the test or procedure.\nIf you have a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit.\nKnow how you can contact your provider if you have questions."", 'to PHI 305 Home Page\nHuntington\'s Disease: Reproductive Decision-Making\nBredon Jones and Cynthia Lee\nWhat is Huntington\'s Disease?\n- Also called:\n- Huntington\'s Chorea\n- Lund- Huntington\'s Chorea\n- Setesdal jerks\n- An incurable, hereditary type\nof brain atrophy\n- A type of ""presenile dementia""\nWho does HD affect?\n- Affects 1 in 10,000\n- 150,000 are at risk in the U.S.\n- Children of those who have HD have\na 50/50 chance of inheriting the disease\n- Anyone who has not developed the gene\nhas no chance of passing it on to their children\nMental Symptoms of HD\n- Change in personality\n- Loss of memory\n- Reduced concentration\n- Loss of initiative\n- Irritability/ aggression\nNeurological Symptoms of HD\n- Involuntary flicking movements\n- These occur suddenly and irregularly\nwith chance distribution all over the body\n- Gait disturbances\n- Slow and long- lasting muscle spasms\n- Speech and language problems\n- Disjoint and indistinct speech\n- May not be able to answer questions\nOther Signs of HD\n- Increased muscle activity often makes\neating and swallowing difficult\n- Altered 24-hour schedule\n- Patient may become nocturnal\n- General lack of personal hygiene\nNormal Brain vs. Brain Affected by HD\n- Some common prenatal tests\n- Huntington\'s Disease\n- Tay- Sachs Disease\n- Muscular Dystrophy\n- Down Syndrome\n- Trisomy 18\n- Cystic Fibrosis\n- An estimated 200 of these tests are\nfor inherited disorders\nReasons for Having an Abortion\n- Jobs and income\n- Financial and lifestyle burdens for the family\n- Insurance discrimination\n- Legally inadmissible but a practical concern\n- How long can this be kept from the child?\n- Having child = child abuse\n- What kind of life will this child have?\n- How motivated will this person be to have a productive\n- The diseases will become less common and less of\nIs it the presence of life...\nŠor the quality of living it?\nWhy you shoulf NOT\nabort a fetus that has a strong chance of having Huntington\'s Disease in\nits adult life!\nA.

And as of yet he does not suffer from any tremors.\n- This procedure is not a cure both men must undergo therapy in the form\nof exercises-both for the body and the brain.\n- Quote from Sam, ""My body feels like it belongs to me again, before\nI felt like a big shaky bowl of jelly, I\'m starting to feel like myself\nagain, I can finally see a future without a wheelchair.""\nI\'m not going to disagree that Huntington\'s disease is not a terrible\ndisorder to have and for most people who are in the late symptoms of the\ndisease a possible cure is probably too late.\nBut we are talking about an unborn fetus and as statistics show the\nsymptoms of Huntington\'s disease doesn\'t even appear until midlife (30-45)\nAnd on top of that the symptoms may run anywhere from 10 to 25 years.\nSay for example, that the woman is pregnant now. That means it may be\n2028 at the earliest that this disease starts to show up. And given the\nevidence that these treatments I have just discussed who\'s to say that\nthere won\'t be a cure before this person start too show symptoms of Huntingtons\'s\nAlso I read that these genetic tests are about 95% accurate. And although\nthat pretty accurate there is still a 5% chance the test could be wrong.\nCase study- 2 women in England\n- 2 women entered the hospital the same day to have some tests\n- The hospital confirmed that one of the women baby had down\'s syndrome\n- So the women who thought she had a baby with downs syndrome elected\nto have an abortion.\n- It was only after the abortion that the hospital realized that they\nhad gotten the two women\'s lab results mixed up and had actually aborted\na healthy baby.\n- When the other women who thought she had a healthy baby found out the\ntruth she aborted her baby also.\n- 2 babies died when only 1 would have.\nSo with the information presented here by A.J. and I we see no reason\nwhy anyone should abort a fetus even if it shows strong evidence for developing\nMany core ethical issues were addressed\nin this topic: abortion, genetic testing, and various neurological diseases.\nBrian and I posed the argument that you should not abort a fetus based\non the fact that it has the potential to have Huntington\'s Disease later\nin life. In order for us to make this argument, we gave a background on\nthe clinical genetic testing and treatment that could be done in the case\nof Huntington\'s Disease. For example, in March of 1993 scientists announced\nthat they had found the gene which causes HD. Due to this somewhat recent\ndiscovery, many avenues of research are presently being investigated in\nthe search for a treatment or cure for HD. The gene discovery has also\nmade it possible for a new predictive test for HD which allows those at\nrisk to find out whether or not they will develop the disease. Because\nof these recent advances in the field of genetics, techniques in which\ngeneticists can determine if a fetus will be deformed or afflicted genetically\nare also being developed and modified. The advances in genetic testing,\nwhile remarkable, are also allowing devastating consequences: more and\nmore parents are choosing to abort their unborn children. The dilemmas\nposed by new genetic technology are nowhere more agonizing than for prospective\nparents who are increasingly faced with a bewildering range of opportunities\nand choices as they contemplate doing what used to be the most natural\nthing in the world, and who soon may find themselves having to decide whether\nor not to terminate a pregnancy because their child is at risk for Huntington\'s\nDisease. Carried one step further, the ability to find out whether or not\na child will be deformed or afflicted might cause the death of a normal\nindividual in a effort to be rid of a possibly genetically diseased fetus.\nWe need to closely examine the ways in which genetic technology affects\nour attitudes. Close to 100% of women who have tested positive from amniocenteses\nfor Down\'s syndrome have abortions. Aborting defective or diseased fetuses\nis widely sanctioned because if born, they are a burden....their families\nwould suffer, they may suffer, and society suffers. We have this need for\nperfection in our society..we need to detect and eliminate defective babies.\nWe have this warped mentality that we are in control of our very existence\nand that we can develop some sort of ""super-race"". We need to\nrecognize the limits of humanity and quit trying to play God. I found a\nquote from a woman whose fetus was at risk for HD and she refused genetic\ntesting. She states, ""In our success-oriented, beauty-obsessed culture,\nthe low intelligence or physical handicaps of defective, deformed, or diseased\nbabies leads us to assume that such an individual\'s life is not worth living.\nAnd yet we are appalled that anyone would abort a fetus just because it\nis a girl. But the Chinese and Indians routinely do so. To Indians, a female\nchild can be a lifelong burden; to be a female in China is to risk abandonment\nor even murder; it\'s not a life worth living. The point is that the value\nwe put on human life is socially and culturally conditioned. We may believe\nwe are doing the right thing, but are we?"" Should we abort every deformed,\ndefected, or diseased baby? If not all of them, then we just abort one.\nWe can select whose life is going to be more valuable than others, because\nevery single life has meaning and a purpose.\nBrian and I made several arguments opposed to abortion\nin this case. For example, if one does carry the gene for HD they have\na 50% of not getting the disease. In retrospect, they also have a 50% chance\nof developing symptoms. Even then one does not usually develop symptoms\nuntil the fourth or fifth decade. So one could live a completely normal\nlife until age 40 or 50. Many middle-aged men and women lead fulfilling\nlives and can contribute to society. HD usually progresses over a 10 to\n25 year period, so one would live for 60 or 75 years. In our opinion, 40\nyears is better than no years! In 40 years there could be a cure for all\nwe know! We all die sometime. If you knew your child was going to be in\na car accident and be a quadriplegic from age 16 on, would you abort him/her\nfrom birth...or would you just wait until he/she was handicapped and then\nkill them? Of course you wouldn\'t! You would love that person and that\nindividual would have probably contributed some meaning to your life. Suppose\nyour ""healthy"" child developed spinal meningitis, are your going\nto kill that child too because he is a burden? Every life has the potential\nto affect another\'s whether the individual is healthy, deformed, or diseased.\nTake a chance on life, your life and theirs.']"	['<urn:uuid:2a6457f8-acbf-4b40-a744-1f5bf26287eb>', '<urn:uuid:a93e134c-0427-4c51-80e2-cd723f323dd9>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-01T23:46:40.222380	7	92	3204
590	What happens when two different viruses infect the same cell?	When two viruses infect the same cell, one virus may prevent the other from replicating through a process called viral interference. This can occur through several mechanisms: by blocking cell receptors, competing for cellular resources, or triggering interferon production. Additionally, some viruses can swap genetic material to create hybrid viruses, particularly in the case of flu viruses.	"[""Genomics and Virology\nViruses are all around us. What are they and how can they affect human health?\nThe Big Picture\nViruses are bundles of genetic material wrapped in a protein coat that can infect living things. Viruses cause damage by hijacking a host cell's machinery to make copies of themselves, often disrupting normal cell function.\nViral vaccines can protect individuals from contracting and spreading common diseases caused by viruses, such as the flu, measles and COVID-19.\nWhat is a virus?\nViruses are tiny infectious particles that are halfway between living and nonliving organisms. They are so small (a millionth of a millimeter) that it would take hundreds to thousands of them to cover the end of a human hair. Each virus is composed of genetic material wrapped in a protein coat. Viruses that infect plants and animals also have a layer of fat molecules. Viruses cannot reproduce on their own. Instead, viruses replicate by infecting a host cell (such as humans, other animals, plants or bacteria), hijacking the host's biological machinery and turning the host cell into a virus-producing factory.\nWhat are viruses made of?\nMost viruses have the same basic structure:\na genetic information molecule in the form of nucleic acids such as DNA or RNA.\na protein layer, or coat, that surrounds and protects the nucleic acids.\nThe protein layer allows viruses to fuse with the outer layer of the cells they attack. The nucleic acid portion encodes genes to make proteins that are essential for the virus to function. These proteins direct viral replication and carry out other activities, such as evading host defenses.\nHow many viruses exist on Earth?\nResearchers estimate that 10 nonillion (10 followed by 30 zeroes) individual viruses exist on Earth. If all the 1030 viruses were organized in a single-file fashion, they would stretch for over 100 million light-years (a single light-year is 6 trillion miles) — which is four times the distance from Earth to the Canis Major Dwarf, our closest galaxy!\nBut only a tiny fraction of the viruses on Earth affect humans. Approximately 200 different viruses are known to cause disease in humans, including:\nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)\nViral agent: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\nViral agent: Poliovirus\nViral agents: Influenzavirus A, B, C or D\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nViral agent: SARS-CoV-2\nHow are viruses transmitted?\nViruses can be transmitted in many ways, including by:\nDirect contact with an infected organism, such as being bitten by a mosquito infected with the West Nile virus. When viruses (and other pathogens) move from one species to another, it is known as a spillover event.\nIndirect contact with someone who is infected, such as through respiratory droplets from a person who is coughing or sneezing.\nAirborne or surface transmission, such as touching a surface where infectious viruses are still located minutes to hours after they landed there, can also result in viral transmission.\nHow do viruses infect living organisms?\nViruses have proteins on their surface that typically latch onto a specific molecule on the surface of a host cell, called a receptor. The viral surface molecule can be likened to a specific key, while the host cell receptor is a lock. When the key meets the lock, it opens a door for the virus to enter the cell.\nViruses enter host cells as particles. Once a viral particle enters a host cell, its nucleic acid material interferes with the host cell's functions, essentially hijacking the proteins and other materials of the host cell to make more copies of the viral particles. One infected cell can release hundreds to thousands of new viral particles, with each of the new viral particles being capable of infecting another cell.\nOnce a virus successfully replicates itself, it leaves the host cell to infect other cells. Some viral infections cause no symptoms. However, when many viral particles infect an organism's cells at the same time, they may cause anything from uncomfortable symptoms to severe illness and even death.\nWhy don't all viruses cause human disease?\nThe exact reason why some viruses infect humans to cause disease and others do not remains a biological mystery. For example, humans usually die if infected by the rabies virus. But while human cells can be infected by circoviruses, they do not seem to cause disease. But circovirus infections in other mammals such as dogs and pigs can cause severe diseases.\nIf it is difficult for viruses to cause human disease, how are some able to do so?\nThere are a few major ways by which certain viruses can cause disease.\nViruses that encode information with RNA rather than DNA tend to have a higher rate of mutations. These mutations allow the viruses to be diverse in their genetic makeup, increasing the probability and pace by which they evade the human immune system.\nIn other cases, two different viruses interested in attacking the same host cell can swap regions of their nucleic acid and make a hybrid virus.\nSome viruses vastly benefit from staying inside their hosts for an extended period of time without being deadly. The lengthier the infection, the longer the virus has to adapt and spread to other hosts.\nFlu viruses can do both — mutate at a high rate and mix with other viruses.\nEach year, scientists measure and predict which versions of the influenza virus, or strains, will be prevalent around the world during the next flu season. Then, they produce an influenza vaccine that works against the new strains. These new strains usually acquire changes in their nucleic acid that make the viruses work differently in the host organism, such as by changing the viral protein coat slightly. That is why scientists must tailor vaccines to specific strains of viruses.\nHow does genomics help us understand viruses?\nGenomics is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on studying an organism's entire nucleic acid material (such as DNA or RNA), which is known as its genome. In 1977, researchers sequenced the first viral genome — phi X174, a virus that attacks bacteria.\nBut much progress has been made since then. For example, as of September 2021, there were 11,465 viral genome sequences available.\nIt is important to generate the complete genome sequence of viruses for several public health reasons. Knowing the viral sequence allows researchers to detect whether a virus is present in a host organism, and it provides clues for how a virus attacks and infects the host cell.\nViruses need to be able to use the functions of host cells to replicate themselves. Inhibiting some of the host cell's functions can potentially make viruses vulnerable. Researchers are studying genome sequences of both viruses and their hosts so as to target specific cell pathways that can be used for treatment.\nStudying viral genomes is key for understanding viral mutations and their evolution over time. Understanding viral genomes also helps researchers track outbreaks and consider how best to treat viral infections or vaccinate against a virus.\nHow can we reduce the spread of viruses?\nMasking, proper handwashing, use of hand sanitizers and social distancing reduce the spread of viruses of many viruses. Antiviral medications and vaccines can eliminate or reduce the severity of diseases caused by viruses.\nMedicines used to treat bacterial infections do not kill viruses.\nHow do viral vaccines work?\nPreviously, viral vaccines contained weakened or dead viruses, with both forms being incapable of causing disease. Now, scientists have an additional tool in their toolkit, producing vaccines using a virus's genome sequence. The viral genome has the information needed to create viral proteins, the active component of the vaccine to which the immune system responds. When injected, these DNA or RNA molecules are used by the host to produce specific viral proteins, and the immune system then recognizes the viral proteins as foreign, sparking a response from multiple types of white blood cells.\nOne such class of white blood cells, called B cells, produces a particular type of protein called an antibody. Antibodies bind to molecules on the surface of the virus and neutralize the virus to prevent it from replicating.\nOnce the human body successfully produces antibodies against a virus, its arsenal is ready for defense when the immune system comes in contact with the same virus in the future.\nWhy do some viruses affect certain people more negatively than others?\nThe exact reason why viruses affect people in different ways is under active study. Researchers attribute it to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. People with existing health conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease or cancer, are more vulnerable to a severe viral infection.\nSome individuals also have specific genomic variants that can influence how a virus interacts with their body. For example, some relatively rare genomic variants make people susceptible to severe viral and other infections. On the flip side, some genomic variants protect specific individuals from viral infections. Researchers continue to study these mechanisms, including the relationship between the level of viral infection and specific genomic variants.\nDoes our body have viral DNA that doesn’t cause disease?\nYes. The human genome contains a considerable amount of DNA that previously existed in viruses. These viral sequences are remnants of past viral infections. Most of these sequences originally came from retroviruses, a type of virus that can insert one copy of its genome into the DNA of a host organism (such as a human). As the host cells make copies of its own genome, it copies the viral DNA as well. These sequences can pass from one generation to the next, becoming a permanent part of the human genome (like a fossil record).\nAt present, DNA from these retroviruses accounts for about 9% of the human genome, but most are thought to be incapable of producing new viral particles.\nLast updated: November 12, 2021"", 'General Properties of Viruses\nWhat is virus?\nThe smallest infectious and acellular microbe.\nConsisting only one kind of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA), and which obligately replicate inside host cells.\nThe complete mature viral particles.\n(The intact infectious virus particles.)\n- The simplest: acellular microbes contain either DNA or RNA\n- The smallest: Pas through 0.2μm filters\n- Obligatory intracellular parasites.\nI.

1079	teabag invention accidental commercial development	Both documents describe the accidental invention of teabags. An American merchant sent tea samples in small sachets which customers mistakenly used as brewing bags. The German company Teekane copied this and supplied 'tea bombs' to troops. Later, Thomas Sullivan's tea samples in silken bags around 1908 led to commercial production, first with gauze bags and then paper ones.	['War produced new circumstances and technology that was used in combat and then found other purposes in peacetime.\nHere are some examples of common products that began or were popularised during the First World War.\nBandaids: Sterile wound dressings were pioneered by Johnson & Johnson during the war, using a method pioneered by French surgeon Alexis Carrell who estimated 80 per cent of amputations on the Western Front were due to wounds becoming infected. Carrel developed a sterile solution of chlorine and applied a dressing to injuries. After the war, Johnson & Johnson made the bandages adhesive. Bandaids were then advanced as sterile, in time for the Second World War.\nDoughnuts: American soldiers on the Western Front were known as ‘doughboys’, one theory being this was due to their love of doughnuts made by the Salvation Army women. Most cultures have a food based on deep-fried batter. In the United States, the dough confectionery appeared when Dutch settlers brought olykoek (‘oily cake’) to New York. The simple doughnut became a symbol of relief for Americans on the front line with Salvation Army workers making them in the field.\nPlastic surgery: Bullets and shrapnel left many soldiers disfigured and at risk of social stigma, prompting wartime surgeons to pioneer skin and bone grafts. The man who fixed faces was Harold Gillies from New Zealand. Dr Gillies was shocked by injuries he saw in the field and requested the British Army set up a plastic surgery unit. The unit in London treated 2,000 patients after the Battle of the Somme.\nTeabags: Teabags were invented by accident when an American merchant put tea in small sachets and sent them as samples to customers. The customers mistakenly believed they were trialling a new product. A German company, Teekane, copied the invention and supplied the “tea bombs” to troops.\nTissues: ‘Cellucotton’ was developed by paper mills in Germany and trademarked by American manufacturer Kimberly-Clark. When America entered the war and surgical cotton was in short supply, the product was used as surgical dressing and in filters for gas masks. An employee ironed the tissue and it was released as Kleenex, ‘handkerchiefs you can throw away’, in 1924.\nWristwatches: Synchronisation was vital during the war, and men had to have both hands free, so wristwatches replaced pocket watches. The French luxury brand Cartier even released its “Tank” watch in a shape inspired by the Renault tanks on the Western Front.\nVegan sausages: The British blockaded Germany from 1914 to 1919, restricting goods to enemy countries and causing malnutrition and deaths. The Mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer, responded to the crisis by making bread from rice, corn and barley and sausages from soy instead of meat. The “peace sausages” were patented by King George V when Germany declined to recognise them as ‘sausage’.\nZips: A Swedish engineer in the United States, Gideon Sundback, invented the zip in 1913 as the ‘hookless fastener’, a slider that locked two sets of teeth together. ‘Zippers’ became mainstream after the US Army and Navy used them in uniforms and boots. The name originated from B. F. Goodrich Company which used the fastener on its boots called ‘zipper’.\nStainless steel: Sheffield is famous for its steel and that is where metallurgist Harry Brearley discovered stainless steel as a hard alloy for rifles and aircraft. Brearley noticed that scraps of steel mixed with chromium did not rust. Stainless steel was then used in cutlery and surgical instruments.', 'We use them or consume them on a regular basis. Without them our lives would never be as convenient as we know them. Here is a list of 10 fascinating American inventions and how they came into being:\n1. Stop Sign\nOne of the most important traffic signs, the stop sign has not always been red! It was first conceived in 1890 by William Phelps Eno of Saugatuck, Connecticut. First used in Detroit, Michigan in 1915, the original stop sign had black letters printed on a white background. In 1922 the octagon shape was selected and in 1924 the background was set to yellow. With fade resistant coating available, the stop sign letters were changed to white on red background.\n2. Ice Cream Scoop\nIf you’ve ever grabbed ice cream from your fridge on a hot summer day, you’d appreciate Alfred L. Cralle’s invention. While working as a porter in Pittsburgh, Cralle noticed that ice cream was difficult to dispense, often requiring two hands and two or more implements to serve. On February 2, 1897 he filed a patent for an “Ice Cream Mold and Disher“. His design was strong, durable and could be constructed in almost any shape. Cralle’s design is still in use today.\n3. Teddy Bear\nThe beloved children’s toy was named after — believe it or not — former US President Theodore Roosevelt. During a hunting day in Mississippi in 1902, one of Roosevelt’s aides had caught an injured bear, tying it to a tree. The former US president ordered to end the bear’s suffering by shooting it (or, according to some versions, by setting it free). A political cartoon depicting the incident by Clifford Berryman inspired Brooklyn toy store owner Morris Mitchom to put together a stuffed bear cub, calling it (after getting Roosevelt’s approval) Teddy’s Bear.\n4. Windshield Wipers\nWhen Alabama-based Mary Anderson visited New York City in winter 1903, she noticed that drivers had difficulty to see through the sleet and the snow. Back home, she developed the first windshield wipers model. The driver would use a lever to wipe the snow off the windshield. Attached to a spring loaded arm with a rubber blade, the lever could be operated from the comfort of one’s warm vehicle. Automakers rejected Anderson’s idea but it was copied once her patent had expired.\n5. Tea Bag\nThe popular tea bag was not invented. It was actually born by accident! Around 1908 New York tea merchant Thomas Sullivan started sending tea samples to his costumers in small silken bags. Some costumers were using them instead of metal infusers, putting the entire bag into the pot rather than emptying out the contents. Growing in popularity, commercial bags were first made from gauze and later from paper.\n6. Pop-up Toaster\nWe like to talk about “the next best thing since sliced bread”. But sliced bread would never be so praiseworthy if it weren’t for the pop-up toaster! Tired of being served burnt toast in his company cafeteria, Minnesota mechanic Charles Strite patented a toaster that incorporated springs and a variable timer, thus eliminating the need for continual human attention. First intended for the restaurant market, the pop-up toaster has evolved and quickly became a mainstay in most American homes.\n7. BAND-AID® Brand Adhesive Bandages\nBack in 1920, newlywed Earle and Josephine Dickson were living together in New Jersey. Being a housekeeper, Josephine kept having cooking accidents resulting in cuts and bruises. Being a cotton buyer at Johnson & Johnson, Earle hit upon an idea one day: By placing cotton gauze squares along an adhesive strip he could prepare ready-made bandages. As a reward for the commercial success of BAND-AID®, Earle was promoted for vice-president in the company.\nThe usage of sunglasses can be traced back to the 12th century China. These darkened lenses did not provide UV protection but eased out the sun glare in the user’s eyes. Chinese judges were wearing these lenses in order to hide their emotions from the accused. In 1929, Sam Foster first put sunglasses in mass production and sold them on the Atlantic City Broadwalk. By 1930 sunglasses were all the rage.\n9. Shopping Cart\nOwner of the Piggly Wiggly supermarket chain in Oklahoma City, Sylvan Goldman had a problem: As the baskets became heavy with items, his costumers, particularly women, tended to stop buying. Inspired by a pair of folding chairs, Goldman developed the first shopping cart in the late 1930s. At it’s core, the cart consisted of two attached folding chairs on wheels, carrying two wired baskets. Goldman employed male and female models to push his invention around the store and eventually became a multimillionaire.\n10. Post-it Note\nOne of the five top selling office supply products worldwide, Post-it notes were actually invented by accident. Two accidents, to be exact. In 1968, while trying to create super strong adhesives for the aerospace industry, 3M chemist Spencer Silver accidentally put together a super weak, pressure sensitive adhesive. Fast forward to 1974. Art Fry, a 3M colleague, approached Silver with an idea of how his adhesive could be used. As part of his after-work choir practice in church, Fry had been looking for bookmarks for his hymnbook that would stick to paper without damaging it. In 1980, when released to the market, the Post-it was unstoppable.']	['<urn:uuid:e9e407d3-0273-45c7-84b9-21ecfab70da7>', '<urn:uuid:b0345d38-5e3f-4381-b11b-564529b2ef34>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-02T10:56:22.807332	5	58	1457
976	groundwater surface runoff pond differences management	Ponds can be fed by either groundwater springs/seeps or surface runoff, each requiring different management approaches. Groundwater-fed ponds tend to stay cooler in summer if spring flow is constant, and require protecting the land contributing to springs. Surface runoff ponds are typically located in depressions draining 10-20 acres per acre of pond, and need careful management of surrounding land use activities since water flows directly over the land into the pond. In both cases, establishing buffer strips and regular monitoring of water quality are essential management practices.	['Correct pond management methods near Water Valley need to always begin with an evaluation and also examination of the present problems in the fish pond. This website talks about some of the essential parts of a normal pond that ought to be determined as well as evaluated prior to dealing with fish pond administration problems.\nAn important first step in analyzing your pond is to establish the key objectives for your fish pond as well as recognize the limitations this will position on other uses. Fish ponds are frequently utilized in numerous ways to satisfy greater than one purpose. As an example, having water available in the pond for fire defense could satisfy one goal without conflicting or contravening other goals such as swimming or fishing. Several use ponds are great as long as the usages are compatible. When contrasting or incompatible uses are preferred, it is required to assign priorities to the owner’s purposes. As an example, the objective of providing for swimming could clash directly with the goal of having water available for watering. Irrigation demands may lower the water level to a factor where swimming is impossible, at once when swimming is most desired. Because of this, you should note and also prioritize details purposes for your pond. Analyzing the fish pond resources is a vital part of setting purposes. Through inspection as well as assessment of the fish pond framework, watershed, water sources, as well as ecology, you could guarantee that the pond sources suffice for your purposes.\nLots of fish pond usages as well as management techniques will need an understanding of the local Mississippi fish pond landmark and resources of water. The pond watershed includes the area of land bordering the fish pond that contributes water to it. Determining the pond watershed is essential since anything that takes place within this location could affect the pond. Finding a fish pond in an uninterrupted area or decreasing disturbance and land utilize adjustments within the fish pond landmark are important parts of shielding a fish pond.\nLots of fish ponds have actually been created where groundwater pertains to the surface as springs or seeps. Ponds fed by these groundwater sources may stay cooler throughout the summer season specifically if the flow from the springtimes is consistent. When possible, the land area contributing water to the springs ought to be determined and protected to make certain appropriate quantity and top quality of water for the fish pond.\nOccasionally fish ponds are built on or near a surface stream. The stream may simply stream through a constructed fish pond or a portion of the stream could be drawn away right into the pond. In this local Water Valley situation, the pond’s health counts totally on the quality and also amount of stream water. The entire land area draining the surface stream comes to be important to the health and wellness of the fish pond.\nWhere Mississippi groundwater or streams are not readily available, a fish pond could lie to record surface area runoff from the surrounding land. Surface area overflow ponds are normally located in anxieties usually draining pipes 10 to 20 acres of land for a one acre fish pond. Land usage activities around these ponds is specifically vital since water moves straight over the land to the fish pond. Care ought to be taken to stay clear of polluting tasks on the land around these ponds.\nNo matter the water resource in Water Valley, it is a good idea to develop a barrier strip of vegetation around the pond to trap debris, nutrients as well as various other toxins before they enter the pond. The barrier strip need to vary in width from 10 feet vast (for a gentle slope) to 50 feet wide (for a steep incline around the pond).\nAt least when every year you need to spend some time to evaluate the pond framework. Regular evaluation and regular maintenance protects a fish pond, keeps it attractive, as well as extends its valuable life. Lack of assessment and prompt repair of problems may trigger much more extreme damage that is either permanent or a lot more pricey to deal with.\nA Mississippi dam as well as any subjected banks need to be checked to make sure that they have full turf cover and also no disintegration. Lawn, weeds, brush as well as small trees should be sometimes cut from the dam and also financial institutions. Trimming smaller sized vegetation permits a visual evaluation of the surface to look for indicators of leakages or tunneling pets. Also evaluate as well as repair any kind of fencings that are made use of to keep animals from accessing the dam or pond embankments. Big trees already existing along the dam or financial institutions ought to be left alone. Reducing or killing large trees may cause leakages to establish around their rotting origins.\nThe pond water level must be consistently observed to check for early signs of leakage. A lot of fish ponds shed some water to below ground seepage and also evaporation. Ponds with little water inflow might shed several inches each day to dissipation in the summertime. Losses more than this may be attributed to a substantial leak that is often noticeable as a damp location outside the pond. Leakages might stem from muskrat burrows, decaying origins, or particles left in the fish pond dam. If you presume your fish pond is leaking, consult Repairing a Leaking Pondto find out more concerning methods to fix leaks.\nA common issue among older fish ponds is sedimentation. Depending on the source of water, fish ponds could fill up over time with debris. As debris fills out the pond, growth of water plants as well as algae will usually boost, due to enhanced sunlight passing through the shallower water.\nDebris levels in the fish pond should be observed as well as kept an eye on. If sedimentation is noticeable, actions must be taken to minimize sediment entering the pond. Examine the pond water resource to determine if subjected banks or upstream tasks are creating boosted sediment. If the fish pond gets extreme amounts of silt, erosion control methods ought to be carried out in the watershed. If you do not own upstream land, a little working out container just upstream from your pond could be developed to obstruct silt or debris. Sediment can be removed from the fish pond through dredging yet this process is typically time-consuming, expensive, as well as devastating to pond ecology.\nFish ponds, like any body of water, bring in both welcomed and also uninvited people. As component of your pond assessment, think about security features and tools to protect visitors. Remove trees, stumps, and also brush which could be a threat to swimmers. Keep the fish pond and also financial institutions without rubbish, cable, canisters, containers, and also other debris. Mark the swimming location and message safety and security rules for all allowed water uses. Area warning signs whatsoever recognized risk areas. If boating and swimming are permitted, consider developing a dock or pier. Connect lifesaving tools such as ring buoys, ropes, or long posts to a safety blog post situated near swimming areas. For additional information on pond safety concerns and devices, speak with the websites entitled Farm Fish pond Security.\nIn addition to safety equipment, several fish pond proprietors opt to lug comprehensive responsibility insurance policy on their residential property. You should talk to an attorney and also an insurance coverage agent for correct interpretation and also protection for the certain scenarios included with your fish pond.\nVarious other areas of fish pond assessment consist of careful dimension of pond location as well as volume. For more information on the best ways to do this, seek advice from Measuring Fish pond Area and also Volume.\nFish pond analysis ought to include regular testing of the fish pond water quality. Water examinations are valuable to record existing troubles and to monitor for vital changes in water high quality. The criteria that must be tested in your fish pond will certainly rely on your intended uses for the fish pond. For more details on pond water high quality, seek advice from Water High quality.\nIdentifying and also inventorying the marine plants and algae expanding in the fish pond throughout the summer season is important to figure out the existing health and wellness of the fish pond and also possible issues in the future. Get In Touch With A Guidebook to Common Water Plants for pictures and also drawings of usual water plants as well as algae that might help determine plants in your fish pond.\nAnalysis of existing fisheries in the pond is very important for future monitoring decisions pertaining to stocking, harvest, and habitat requirements. Fisheries assessment is achieved mainly by records maintained by anglers and visual observations of numbers and dimensions of fish from the pond bank. Expert fisheries biologists can additionally be worked with to conduct electrofishing studies of ponds as well as lakes to supply even more in-depth assessment info and administration strategies.', 'Appropriate fish pond monitoring techniques near Swedesboro need to constantly start with an evaluation and also assessment of the existing conditions in the pond. This website discusses some of the crucial parts of a normal pond that ought to be recognized as well as inspected before taking on fish pond monitoring concerns.\nA crucial primary step in evaluating your pond is to establish the primary objectives for your fish pond and also understand the constraints this will certainly position on other usages. Fish ponds are frequently used in a number of methods to satisfy more than one objective. For instance, having water readily available in the fish pond for fire protection might satisfy one purpose without interfering or contravening other goals such as swimming or fishing. Multiple use ponds are fine as long as the usages work. When contrasting or inappropriate usages are preferred, it is necessary to designate priorities to the owner’s objectives. For instance, the purpose of providing for swimming could conflict directly with the purpose of having water readily available for irrigation. Watering needs could decrease the water level to a point where swimming is impossible, at once when swimming is most wanted. Therefore, you ought to note as well as focus on details objectives for your fish pond. Examining the pond sources is a vital element of establishing purposes. With inspection and also assessment of the pond structure, landmark, water resources, and also ecology, you can insure that the pond sources suffice for your objectives.\nSeveral pond usages and administration approaches will call for an understanding of the local New Jersey fish pond landmark and sources of water. The fish pond landmark consists of the area of land surrounding the pond that adds water to it. Determining the fish pond watershed is important because anything that takes place within this area could impact the fish pond. Locating a fish pond in an undisturbed location or lessening disruption and also land use adjustments within the pond watershed are essential components of securing a pond.\nMany ponds have been created where groundwater comes to the surface as springs or seeps. Ponds fed by these groundwater sources might stay cooler during the summer specifically if the flow from the springtimes is relentless. Ideally, the land area adding water to the springs must be determined and also safeguarded to ensure ample quantity and quality of water for the fish pond.\nIn some cases ponds are created on or near a surface area stream. The stream might simply flow with a constructed fish pond or a portion of the stream may be diverted into the fish pond. In this local Swedesboro situation, the fish pond’s health and wellness depends entirely on the top quality and also amount of stream water. The entire acreage draining the surface stream becomes critical to the health and wellness of the pond.\nWhere New Jersey groundwater or streams are not offered, a fish pond may lie to capture surface runoff from the surrounding land. Surface area runoff fish ponds are generally discovered in clinical depressions typically draining pipes 10 to 20 acres of land for a one acre pond. Land use tasks around these ponds is specifically important given that water streams straight over the land to the fish pond. Treatment must be required to avoid polluting tasks on the land around these fish ponds.\nDespite the water resource in Swedesboro, it is a great idea to establish a barrier strip of greenery around the fish pond to catch debris, nutrients as well as other pollutants prior to they get in the fish pond. The buffer strip ought to vary in width from 10 feet vast (for a mild slope) to 50 feet wide (for a high slope around the fish pond).\nAt least as soon as annually you ought to take a while to evaluate the pond framework. Regular evaluation and also constant upkeep safeguards a pond, maintains it appealing, as well as extends its valuable life. Lack of evaluation as well as punctual fixing of issues might create much more severe damages that is either irreparable or extra pricey to take care of.\nA New Jersey dam as well as any subjected financial institutions must be checked to ensure that they have full turf cover and no erosion. Lawn, weeds, brush and also tiny trees should be occasionally cut from the dam and also banks. Cutting smaller plants enables a visual examination of the surface to check for signs of leaks or delving animals. Also inspect as well as repair any type of fencings that are used to maintain livestock from accessing the dam or pond embankments. Huge trees currently existing along the dam or banks need to be left alone. Reducing or eliminating huge trees might trigger leaks to create around their decaying origins.\nThe pond water degree should be regularly observed to check for very early indicators of leakage. A lot of fish ponds shed some water to underground infiltration and evaporation. Fish ponds with little water inflow might lose a number of inches each day to dissipation in the summertime. Losses above this may be attributed to a substantial leakage that is often visible as a wet location outside the fish pond. Leaks may stem from muskrat burrows, decaying roots, or particles left in the pond dam. If you believe your fish pond is leaking, speak with Taking care of a Leaking Pondto learn more regarding techniques to deal with leaks.\nA common issue among older fish ponds is sedimentation. Relying on the source of water, fish ponds may fill out gradually with sediment. As sediment fills out the fish pond, growth of marine plants and algae will usually boost, because of increased sunshine passing through the shallower water.\nSediment degrees in the pond should be observed as well as kept track of. If sedimentation is visible, steps should be taken to minimize debris getting in the pond. Examine the pond water source to figure out if revealed banks or upstream tasks are causing increased sediment. If the pond gets extreme amounts of silt, erosion control techniques ought to be executed in the watershed. If you do not own upstream land, a tiny resolving basin just upstream from your fish pond can be developed to intercept silt or particles. Debris could be gotten rid of from the fish pond through dredging yet this process is typically lengthy, pricey, and also devastating to pond ecology.\nFish ponds, like any type of body of water, draw in both invited and unwelcome people. As component of your fish pond examination, consider safety and security functions and also equipment to shield visitors. Remove trees, stumps, as well as brush which could be a threat to swimmers. Maintain the fish pond and financial institutions devoid of rubbish, wire, cans, containers, and various other particles. Mark the swimming area and also article safety guidelines for all allowed water usages. Place warning signs in all recognized threat places. If boating and swimming are permitted, think about building a dock or pier. Attach lifesaving tools such as ring buoys, ropes, or long poles to a safety article situated near swimming areas.

1293	oak wilt elm disease which worse	Both diseases have severely impacted trees, but Dutch Elm disease has had a more devastating impact. Dutch Elm disease has killed 80% of elm trees in Toronto, reducing them from being 90% of trees in U of T campus groves to just 158 trees compared to 1368 maples. Meanwhile, oak wilt, while serious and often fatal for red oaks within weeks of infection, has been detected in 45 Michigan counties and spreads more slowly in white oaks which are more resistant. Dutch Elm disease has historically been more catastrophic, leading to the death of millions of elms in North America and fundamentally changing urban forestry practices.	"['Lansing, MI -(Ammoland.com)- July 15 marks the end of the three-month window when oak wilt can be transmitted from diseased to healthy red oak trees.\nAlthough this time frame is coming to a close, the Department of Natural Resources reminds residents not to move wood from trees with oak wilt. Wood from oak wilt-killed trees can produce spores, which can infect healthy oaks if (the infected trees are) wounded between April 15 and July 15 the following year.\nAccording to Dr. Robert Heyd, forest health management program manager for the DNR’s Forest Resources Division, oak wilt is a serious disease of oak trees. It mainly affects red oaks, including northern red oak, black oak and pin oak. Red oaks often die within a few weeks after becoming infected. Because white oaks are more resistant, the disease progresses more slowly.\n“The normal time-tested advice is to prevent oak wilt by not pruning or otherwise ‘injuring’ oaks from April 15 to July 15,” Heyd said.\nHe added that the spread of oak wilt occurs during this time of year as beetles move spores from trees killed last year by oak wilt to wounds on healthy oaks.\nOak wilt has been detected in Alcona, Allegan, Alpena, Antrim, Barry, Benzie, Berrien, Calhoun, Cass, Cheboygan, Clinton, Crawford, Dickinson, Genesee, Gladwin, Grand Traverse, Iron, Kalamazoo, Kalkaska, Kent, Lake, Lenawee, Livingston, Macomb, Manistee, Menominee, Midland, Missaukee, Monroe, Montcalm, Montmorency, Muskegon, Newaygo, Oakland, Ogemaw, Oscoda, Ottawa, Roscommon, Saginaw, Shiawassee, St. Joseph, Van Buren, Washtenaw, Wayne and Wexford counties.\nAlthough oak wilt hasn’t been detected in every Michigan county, Heyd said the need for vigilance is present statewide.\nSpring is a popular time for people to move firewood to vacation properties and other locations. During this April-to-July period, Heyd said that it’s vital not to move wood from oak wilt-killed trees. These trees are often cut into firewood and moved, sometimes many miles from their original locations. Any wounding of oaks in this new location can result in new oak wilt infections.\n“With the transport of firewood and other tree-related activities, you have to assume the risk is present, whether you live in metro Detroit or in the Upper Peninsula,” Heyd said.\nOnce an oak is infected, the fungus moves to neighboring red oaks through root grafts. Oaks within approximately 100 feet of each other; depending on the size of the trees, have connected or grafted root systems. Left untreated, oak wilt will continue to move from tree to tree, progressively killing more red oak over an increasingly larger area.\n“There are other oak problems that can easily be confused with oak wilt,” Heyd said. “Unlike most other problems, oak wilt causes the tree to suddenly drop its leaves in July or August. The first step is to confirm oak wilt if present. If confirmed, you will be given information on treatment options.”\nTo report a suspected oak wilt site, email DNR-FRD-Forest-Health@michigan.gov or call 517-284-5895.\nTo get more information on the background, symptoms and prevention of oak wilt, visit Michigan SAF Forest Info.\nTo learn more about other forest health issues in Michigan, go to Michigan Forest Health.\nAbout The Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR)\nThe Michigan Department of Natural Resources is committed to the conservation, protection, management, use and enjoyment of the state’s natural and cultural resources for current and future generations.

This Latin phrase is U of T’s motto, and means “as a tree through the ages,” expressing the hope that U of T will grow large and impressive like a mature tree. So to locate the oldest tree on campus is thus to find the tree that best embodies the motto of the school, and to find U of T’s very own living, breathing, and unacknowledged arboreal mascot.\nThis quest initially seemed like it would be over in a few minutes. Within two minutes of my 11:47pm email, Stan Szwagiel, head of grounds at U of T St. George, emailed me back with an enjoyably definitive answer: the oldest tree on campus is the elm tree behind the UTSU building. An impromptu hike to this location revealed an appropriately large and beautiful tree, which I was surprised I hadn’t noticed before. This tree has street cred: a few minutes after I heard from Mr. Szwagiel, Terry Carleton, a professor at the faculty of forestry, independently told me that this tree was his bet for the oldest on campus. Mr. Szwagiel thought that the size of the tree indicated that it could even be as old as 165 years, which would make it one year older than U of T (which came into existence in 1850), and that it could well be even older.\nThrough Paul Aird, an emeritus professor of forestry who has written a book about ecological fables and nature tales, I learned that the U of T Archives has a 1910 topographical map that lists all the trees that were then on campus. I consulted this map – which is over 6 feet tall and requires two people to open – but, intriguingly, the elm is not on it. The map does have some irregularities; could the cartographers just have missed the tree? For the UTSU elm is visible in an aerial photograph of the campus taken in 1933, and partially visible in a 1924 image. So it is at least 90 years old, and the size of the tree in those photographs makes it seem like it must have been more than a teenager then. And Mr. Szwagiel told me about another large elm tree on campus that recently had to be cut down after disease killed it. That tree had a trunk that was much smaller than the UTSU elm. When it was cut an arborist counted its rings and it was well over 150 years old. It’s enormous stump is still visible beside the path between Whitney Hall and the back campus field.\nIn order to learn more about trees in general I contacted Jennifer Gagné, a former forestry student who now works for the ministry of the environment. She used to lead tree tours on campus and took me on one. Our first stop was the two little copses planted at the centre of the forestry department building. According to Gagné, the one on the north-side is meant to replicate a Carolinian forest (sample species: a tulip tree, a Kentucky coffee tree), and the other a boreal forest (spruce, tamarack). According to Gagné, being enclosed within these buildings is not protecting or helping the trees; the boreal trees especially are not shade tolerant, and random shrubs have taken over the undergrowth. I later learned from Tony Ung, a forestry researcher, that the copses had gotten out of control and that they had to urgently cut out some of the brush. “We feared for the safety of students. People were sleeping in there. We found needles,” he told me. But today it seemed benign, soggy, lonely to me. Though for Gagné, the important personalities, the trees, are still here. To know the names and life stories of trees is to be surrounded by their presences. Human beings depend on trees quite as much as on rivers and the seas; the ability to know them is meaningful. And every tree has a different method to identify it, some more heuristic than scientific, like when Gagné began plunging her palm repeatedly into a conifer’s needles. If it hurts, it’s a Red Pine. And it did hurt. Leaving the copses, Gagné showed me a recent building at New College that had a hole in the third-story concrete balcony to allow the tree to grow through the building. A high-minded design, or maybe because the building was right beside the forestry department, where it’s probably harder to get rid of a perfectly healthy tree.\nThere is an oak tree on U of T’s coat of arms (rounded leaves, hence, a white oak), but an elm tree was probably the most significant tree in U of T’s history, being the deciding factor in the location of U of T’s most iconic building. In 1856, before UC College was built, the governor general and the architect were surveying the grounds. The governor general wanted the building to face west, though to the architect–and to us today–it seemed obvious that it should face south. The decision was made by the fact of a tall elm tree which the governor general, calling it, “the handsomest tree about Toronto,” did not want cut. He is reported to have told the architect: “I am sure that you can never put anything up half so pretty."" So to save that tree, the building faced south. The tree was toppled in a storm the following year.\nU of T exists atop the ghosts of cut forests and lost trees. If you stood in front of the UTSU elm as time was rolled back a hundred and fifty years, you would see the UTSU building taken down, Soldier’s Tower unspooled, and Hart House deconstructed. You would arrive to see the elm growing beside a thicket of other trees, all nestled together around the banks of a small pond. The pond is McCaul’s Pond (the tree is still on a bit of hill: the rise that used to be the pond’s edge), which was drained in the summer of 1879. Back then, there were only about 200 students at U of T, and the college was a semi-rural retreat, somewhat removed from the city, and nature and trees were among the chief pleasures of the school. Students and professors spent the afternoons taking walks. “No professor,” a student at the time said, “if he could avoid it, lectured in the afternoon, which was reserved for recreation and walking.”\nPeople enjoy trees, but they also cut them down for heat and timber, and to make room for development. But perhaps the most destructive damage that people inflict on trees is accidental, though the spreading of disease. The UTSU elm is diseased with the scourge of elm trees, Dutch Elm disease, which spread to Ontario in 1951. Originating in the Himalayas, and named for the Dutch scientists who identified it, the disease is a fungal parasite. The effects of Dutch Elm are ruinous; Ms. Gagné explains that “elms almost kill themselves, because it triggers them to cut off the water system in their xylem, in order to get the fungus out.” In North America, elms have died by the millions. Many thought Dutch Elm would bring about the extinction of the American elm.\nElms used to be the dominant species at U of T, and now are among the more rare of native trees. There were more than 100,000 elms in metropolitan Toronto in the 1960s, 10 percent of all street trees, and 90 percent of the trees in the groves on the University of Toronto campus were American elm. There are currently 1368 maples to 158 elms. The main road into Kings College Circle used to be marked by a row of tall elms; now it has short young oaks. The introduction of Dutch elm disease in North America is the most significant event in the history of urban forestry. The disease altered urban forestry policy and law, and changed the public’s awareness of street tree management. Arborists trying to combat the devastation of this disease pioneered the profession of “tree health care,” opening up an entirely new industry for managing the care of urban trees. In fact, the term “urban forestry” was coined by a U of T professor, Erik Jorgensen, who was working on dealing with Dutch Elm disease. Even the current emerald ash borer pandemic is directly linked to Dutch Elm disease because most of the ash population are replacement trees for lost elms. In Toronto, 80% of the elm trees have been lost to Dutch Elm disease.\nMr. Szwagiel met me at the UTSU tree, and pointed out the tiny tell-tale holes at the base of the tree where it is has been injected with fungicide to stop the Dutch Elm. The tree gets hooked up to bottles of fungicide like a patient on an IV drip. If enough fungicide can be injected into the tree’s vascular system, then a spore introduced by a beetle won’t be able to germinate. Without this treatment, which is expensive, the tree could die within a year. Mr. Szwagiel also pointed out the extensive series of steel wires strung between the tree’s branches, which that add strength to it’s canopy and keep it from collapsing in storms. Without question this tree would be dead by now if it weren’t for the labour of the forestry professors, grounds crew, and arborists who contribute to it’s well-being. The university makes these efforts because these trees give campus much of its well-to-do, pastoral, collegiate identity. So perhaps trees should take as their motto “as a university through the ages.” The motto’s declaration to make the school like a tree—a line adapted from the roman poet Horace (Odes I.12, lines 45–46) “crescit occulto velut arbor aevo fama Marcelli”: Marcellus’ fame, its up-growth hid / springs like a tree—makes a fine picturesque image, but it does not reflect the fragility of our tree canopies in an age of globalized tree disease. The trees persist, but not without struggle and constant maintenance; which is also true enough for a university.\nU of T St. George currently has over 3,000 trees (more now than in 1910), and, though the UTSU elm is a strong suspect, the jury is out on which one of them is empirically the oldest. Tony Ung says that the only way to know for sure is to take a core sample of the tree. He showed me the apparatus, a sort of tree corkscrew—“from the 1940s, I think”—that he would use to get a sample; a process that, most likely, would not harm the tree. But it is still a risk and Mr. Szwagiel does not want to immediately pursue that option. The age of this tree will thus remain a mystery. But thanks to the care it receives, this elm could live another 300 years. We will send someone then to report on how the university is doing compared to the tree. In the meantime, we can enjoy it.']"	['<urn:uuid:ff4bffec-50a9-470a-ac24-0b8e52f20136>', '<urn:uuid:75273a8f-bf42-495d-bd61-3a5709b9e05c>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-02T11:45:30.494741	6	106	2400
451	What hardware components are essential to assemble a CNC machine?	A CNC machine typically requires both electrical and mechanical parts. The essential electrical components include a processor/control board (or PC), stepper shield, stepper drivers, and power supply. For mechanical parts, you need cutting tools, a frame, guides and supports, as well as basic hardware like spacers, washers, nuts, screws, and bolts.	['CNC machines have been around for decades, with their history stretching back to the 1950s. In that time, they’ve transformed the way we manufacture things. They’ve also helped to democratize the process, providing a way for budding engineers and makers around the world to create their own products. With such versatility on offer, you—yes, you!—might be wondering how to build your own CNC machine.\nIf this sounds like you, never fear—the team at Scan2CAD is here to help. We’re here to provide handy tips on building a CNC machine. We’ll include some great options for CNC kits, as well as details and resources covering how to build your own CNC machine from scratch. Let’s get started!\nWhat to look out for\nSo, you’re about to build your own CNC machine. But where do you start?\nBefore comparing kits or choosing components, it’s important to start answering some fundamental questions.\nWhat are you going to make with your CNC machine?\nOf course, CNC machines are versatile, and allow you to create a wide range of different products. However, different types of CNC machine are better for different projects.\nStart by considering the types of projects you’re likely to take on, and use this as a basis for the type of CNC machine you choose. This decision will also inform the components you need to produce your machine.\nHow much time do you have to build the machine?\nThe answer to this question will derive in part from whether you are interested in CNC as a hobby or as a potential business. After all, it’s worth spending longer on your machine if there are possible financial rewards at the end.\nHowever, this isn’t the only factor you should take into consideration. CNC Cookbook recommends that, if this is your first build, that you start with a simpler machine. This way, you’ll be more likely to get it done, rather than biting off more than you can chew and giving up.\nHow much are you looking to spend on your CNC machine?\nMuch as with the above question, your answer here will partly arise from whether you intend to use the machine for professional or personal use.\nIn both scenarios, however, it’s always worth trying to get the most for your money. As such, you should evaluate which parts and components are necessary for the machine you want to build. If you don’t need them, don’t buy them! Set yourself a budget you know you can afford, and stick to it.\nWhat skill sets do you have?\nIt’s easier to build your own CNC machine if you already have some of the necessary skills.

If you’d rather have the freedom to build your CNC machine your way, then building from scratch can be a great option.\nWhat you’ll need\nAs you may have already guessed, there are a vast array of possibilities when it comes to building a CNC machine. However, your CNC machine will likely include most, if not all, of the following parts:\n- Electrical parts, including:\n- Processor/control board (some machines may use a PC)\n- Stepper shield\n- Stepper drivers\n- Power supply\n- Mechanical parts, including:\n- Tools, such as cutting tools\n- A frame\n- Guides and supports\n- Spacers, washers, nuts, screws, and bolts\nOf course, figuring out which type of CNC machine to build will help to clarify which parts you’ll need. If you’re struggling to come to a decision, check out our comparison of CNC machines to find out which one’s right for you.\nThe exact assembly of your CNC machine will depend on the type of machine you choose to build, the custom options you choose, what you plan on making with the machine, and many other factors. Nevertheless, the key steps to build your own CNC machine will generally be as follows:\n1. Design your machine\nCreating a design for your CNC machine will help give you a clear idea on the finished project. You may choose to start out with a sketch, before converting the paper drawing to CAD using programs such as Scan2CAD. From there, you can extrude your 2D drawing into a 3D CAD model in programs such as SolidWorks (or one of our top affordable SolidWorks alternatives).\n2. Get the parts\nOnce you’ve designed your machine, you can then proceed to buying the parts for it. Use the list above as a guideline, but feel free to customize the machine to meet your requirements!\n3. Construct the frame\nYour frame is what holds together all the other parts of your machine. As such, it’s the first construction you’ll perform when you build your own CNC machine. Metals such as aluminum are good choices for your frame, as they will ensure stability and rigidity. This will, in turn, help increase the lifespan of your other hardware.\n4. Add the gantry\nNot all CNC machines will feature a gantry, but as one of the most popular design options, we’ve featured it here. A gantry allows your machining tool to move along the Y-axis; it will hold your tool in place above the workspace. Ensure to balance forces acting on your gantry to reduce the potential of machine deformation or shaking.\n5. Bring in the Z-axis…\nYour tool itself will be moving up and down along the Z-axis. You will, however, need a place to house your tool. You’ll mount this housing to the gantry, giving your tool a greater range of depth.\n6. …then the X-axis\nAdding bearings and guide rails will help to maintain the rigidity of your CNC machine, and will enable your tool to move forwards and backwards along the X-axis.\n7. Drive it!\nNow that you’ve added the parts that will allow your CNC to move forwards and backwards, it’s time to add those that will actually make it move on this axis. This is the drive system, typically made up of motors, pulleys, spindles, screws, bolts and nuts, amongst other parts.\n8. Introduce the electronic parts\nYou’re now ready to add the many electronic parts that will make up the heart of your CNC machine. Key to this is the motor that will, ultimately, drive the machining tool. In this case, you’ll have a choice of stepper and servo motors. However, this is far from the only important tool: you’ll also need to include a PSU, breakout board, drivers, and—of course—a processor or computer.\n9. Put the table top on\nYou can’t machine parts without having a place to put them! Your cutting table can be made of plywood, MDF or metal. Bear in mind, however, that not all of these materials will be suitable for the type of CNC machine you’re creating!\n10. From rotational to linear movement\nThe motor you’ve installed will cause the machine to spin. However, your CNC machine will typically require linear motion. A spindle converts the rotational motion of the motor to linear motion, meaning that your machining tool will be able to move up and down.\n11. Choose your controller\nA CNC controller is vital to the operation of a CNC machine. This is the part that interprets the signals given by your processor or computer, and transforms them into signals for the electronic parts of your CNC machine. As such, it acts as the “brain” of the entire system.\n12. Select your software\nYour machine is now almost operational! First, however, you’ll need to choose the software that controls your CNC machine. Most of these will use languages such as G-code to control the movement of your machine along its three axes, enabling you to perform the action of machining.\n13. Add your machining tool\nThere are a wide variety of machining tools available. Metal cutting tools are one of the simpler varieties, but more elaborate machines may use laser or plasma cutting tools.\n14. Start making things!\nYour machine is now complete, and you’re ready to start tackling your own projects!\nWhy build your own CNC machine?\nIf you’ve read this entire article, then chances are that you’re already sold on the benefits of building a CNC machine. However, if you’re still unsure, we’ll quickly run through some of the best reasons to build your own CNC machine:\n- Customizability. When you buy a CNC machine, it may lack features you need—or make you pay extra for features you don’t. If you build your own CNC machine, you have the ability to choose what (not) to include.\n- Save money. Purchasing a ready-made CNC machine can often set you back thousands of dollars. Building your own CNC machine instead can give you the same results for a much lower cost.\n- Create awesome things. Okay, so this applies to any CNC machine, regardless of whether you buy or build. But it remains true—building a CNC machine gives you the ability to manufacture your own amazing products. Whether you want to launch your own business, replace hard-to-find parts, or simply create custom products that aren’t available anywhere else, you can do it with a CNC machine. And where better to start as a maker than in building your own machine?']	['<urn:uuid:5737044f-d5b5-43b2-8676-ecec9e6dc9b0>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-01T22:47:46.423955	10	51	1834
720	I'm fascinated by local food traditions and heard about a big bean festival somewhere in Piedmont - could you explain what this event is all about?	The Carnevale di Santhià features Italy's largest fagiolata (bean festival), where around 20,000 portions of beans are distributed. This event begins with a unique wake-up call at 5 AM, when the Corpo Pifferi e Tamburi, one of Italy's oldest and most important bands, starts playing to wake up the townspeople, especially the Piazza commanders who run the bean festival.	"['The Carnival in the Province of Vercelli\nThis Carnival celebration is one of the most renowned in the Vercelli province and throughout Piedmont. The most typical characteristic of the Carnevale di Borgosesia - the Mercû Scûrot - first occurred in 1854 when a group of merrymakers did not want the fun to stop. On that day, elegant men held a sort of ""funeral” for Carnival on Ash Wednesday, and accompanied a casket containing a straw puppet representing Carnival through the streets of the Borgo.\nThe next year, the puppet was named ""Peru Magunella”: the first name derived from a dialectal pronunciation of the patron saint’s name (Saint Peter) and the second name came from ""Magoni”, the nickname used to identify people from Borgosesia. Only 30 years later, a person began to interpret the puppet and they also found the puppet a wife, called""Gin Fiammàa”. The Mercû Scûrot, considered to be a unique event in Europe, is held on Ash Wednesday, the day on which the Borgosesia Carnival finishes traditionally, unlike the other celebrations in surrounding towns, which end on Shrove Tuesday. According to tradition, in 1854 at the end of the Carnival celebrations, a group of German and Alsatian businessmen employed at a wool factory founded a few years prior - the first nucleus of what would evolve into Manifattura Lane Borgosesia - were unhappy that the celebrations were over, and decided to have a funeral for the festivity on the morning of Ash Wednesday. Dressed elegantly, they paraded a fake casket through the town in an improvised funeral procession and stopped for a drink in the osterie.\nThis tradition still continues today. Participants dress up in top hats and capes and carry wooden ladles that they use to drink wine that is distributed in specific locations along the procession route. They start their walk after lunch, and end the procession with a reading of the last will and testament of Peru Magunella. Then, they burn the puppet for good luck.\nCarnevale di Crescentino\nThe masks of the historical celebration Carnevale Storico Crescentinese, which has taken place since 1929, are ""Regina Papetta” and ""Conte Tizzoni”, who are crowned according to a particular rite on the day before the parade of allegorical floats. This Carnival tradition is linked to an actual event that happened in 1529, when a group of young Crescentino citizens, allied with the city of Vische, rebelled against and killed their despot ruler, Count Riccardo IV Tizzoni.\nThe legend starts with historical facts: in the year 1529, Count Riccardo IV Tizzoni added to the oppression that he already subjected the people to by imposing the ""ius primae noctis” law, or rather his right to sleep with brides on their wedding nights. During the night between 14 and 15 February 1529, as the town appeared to be quietly awaiting the last days of Carnival, the daughter of the miller from the Mulino Stella cut off the tyrant’s head as the people began a revolt signalled by the bell in the Torre Civica. According to tradition, the name ""Papetta” derives from the maize (corn) used to make cornmeal for polenta, since the girl was the miller’s daughter. The festival ends with a masked parade featuring allegorical floats, musical bands, folkloric groups, majorettes and flag throwers.\nCarnevale di Santhià\nThe Carnevale di Santhià is the oldest Carnival celebration in Piedmont. It was created by Abbadia, a lay association that used to organise dances and Carnival celebrations. The Abbadia is mentioned for the first time in a document dated 1338, but in the 15th century it was replaced by the Antica Società Fagiolesca, the predecessor of the current Comitato Carnevale.\nEvery year on 6 January, they open the celebrations: the main characters and rites connected with the event have maintained their significance over time. These are the characteristics of the Carnevale di Santhià, and they transform the festival into an essential event for that time of year.\nThe masks are Majutin dal Pampardù and Stevulin ‘dla Plisera, and they rule the city during the three-day celebration. According to legend, Stevulin and Majutin were two peasants, a farmer and his wife, who came to the city for their honeymoon. The local governor, with the townspeople’s consent, gave the keys to the city to the newly-weds and allowed them to administer justice and govern the city for three days. This fact is the origin of the modern ""key ceremony”, after which Stevulin reads a speech to the population in the local dialect, which contains humoristic commentary about current events.\nDuring the presentation ceremony of Stevu and Majot, the new couple receives the typical objects that make up their costumes: the ""caplin”, the ""cavagna”, the ""umbrela” for him and the ""spunciun, scusal and mantlin-a” for her, while the two actors from the previous year are inducted into the group of ""Stevu e Majot Früst”.\nSome of the most memorable moments and rites of this Carnival tradition include: the ancient rite of the Salamanda, in which a group of people dressed up like pigs form a procession in the city streets and distribute porchetta sandwiches; Italy’s largest fagiolata (bean festival) which involves distributing around 20,000 portions; the wake-up call at 5 am before the fagiolata, during which the Corpo Pifferi e Tamburi (one of the oldest and most important bands in Italy) starts playing at 5 o’clock to wake the townspeople up, especially the Piazza commanders who run the bean festival.\nThe final ceremony is the Rogo del Babciu, during which the papier-mâché puppet representing the essence of Carnival is burned and the statue of Ganduja is taken down from its throne.\nCarnevale di Varallo\nThe Carnevale di Varallo, one of the city’s oldest traditions, is called the ""day of the old Pasquetta” locally. It ends on the first day of Lent with the Processo al Marcantonio (Trial of Marcantonio, the main mask of the celebration).\nThe origins of this celebration date back to 1595, when a group of friars from the Sacro Monte di Varallo were discovered as they celebrated Carnival. Today, the masked group impersonating the spirit of Carnival consists of twelve people with two main characters, King Marcantonio and his wife, Cecca.\nIn the past ""Pasquetta” symbolised Epiphany, and was celebrated with a large bonfire to welcome the new year. It was a festival to bury the past and invoke prosperity for the New Year and the start of Carnival. Over time, the popular tradition turned ""Pasquetta” into the mother of Marcantonio and Carnival in general. This character is a perpetually fertile woman who, each year, is entrusted with birthing a new Carnival and a new child called Marcantonio, the King of the Dughi and Falchetti. The parade held each year on Epiphany features masks representing the ""vecchio Bacucco”, Pasquetta’s husband, and the ""Balia” (the wet nurse). Vecchio Bacucco is only Marcantonio’s nominal father, and this is the subject of the trial and bonfire for Pasquetta on the Mastallone.\nAnother unmissable event featured in the Varallo Carnival celebration is the ""Gran Bal dla Cecca” dance held at the Teatro Civico. ""Cecca” is the wife of Marcantonio, and the Queen of Carnival. Since 1950, tradition commands that Cecca is elected the night before the patron saint celebration, during the Gran Veglione di San Gaudenzio, and now she is chosen from one of the girls from Varallo, but her identity is kept secret until the night of the ""Ballo della Cecca” dance. On Sunday, Marcantonio receives the keys to the city, and then later a parade with the Carnival masks lightens the atmosphere in the streets of Varallo.\nVisitors should not miss the events on Shrove Monday, the ""Giurnàa ‘dla leugna” and the ""Bal ‘dla Lüm”. For this tradition, on this day, Varallesi from the Crevola frazione cross the bridge over the Sesia River to get wood from the inhabitants to cook the paniccia on the following day. The origin of this tradition is unclear, but the official reason is that in the past there was a sentence that had given the Varallesi a sort of feudal right over the community of Crevola. Now, this practice has become a custom. The day ends with a traditional dance called ""Lum”, after the old stable lights that provided light during vigils of Valsesian mountain people. Now, it is a symbol of the Carnevale di Varallo. The dance dates back to 1876 when the Osteria del Lupo in Varallo Vecchio organised a dance for Carnival with rustic decorations, including iron ""Lum” lamps to embellish the dining hall. Prizes are given during the evening for the best costume and the best masked group.\nTuesday celebrates traditional Paniccia, a nutritious soup with rice and vegetables prepared in enormous pots, which at one time was the only guarantee of a hot meal for the poor and needy. Tradition commands that the fires be lit at 6 AM in Piazza San Carlo.\nThese Carnival celebrations conclude with the Processo al Marcantonio (Trial of Marcantonio), and the bonfire on the evening of Ash Wednesday, with a performance that makes fun of the most important news of the city.\nCarnevale di Vercelli\nThe Carnevale di Vercelli has become an important celebration, well-known even outside the region. It starts with the presentation of the main masks of Vercelli, ""Bicciolano” and his consort ""Bela Majin”, and amid evening celebrations, bean festivals in the city rioni, and children’s dances, the most important moment of Carnival finally arrives: the parade with floats and groups of people in costume.\nThe story of the Bicciolano mask dates back to the end of the 1700s, when the French Revolution was coming to Piedmont. Vercelli was governed by a rich untouchable ruling class that imposed taxes and duties for personal reasons. In defence of the people, Carlin Belletti (nicknamed ""il Bicciolano”) a legendary figure at the time, started a protest. Imprisoned by the powerful rulers in the castle of Ivrea, Belletti was freed and then returned to Vercelli in triumph. His name went down in history linked with the ideals of justice and equality.\nThe most important events of Carnival - after the proclamation of the ""Bela Majin” - are the arrival of Bicciolano and his consort, with the symbolic Key Ceremony and the parade of allegorical floats. These unique moments contain the true spirit of Carnival and, for this reason, feature the participation of several Carnival committees from all over the province. This popular event records an increase in the number of visitors every year, because people want to enjoy this happy, carefree time of year in which everything is possible.\nBicciolano has been included in the list of official masks of the Associazione Centro Coordinamento Maschere Italiane.']"	['<urn:uuid:55b2af4a-eecc-4b4c-8f80-e989a9f7de72>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-01T23:21:14.341336	26	59	1777

Tom Trbojevic scored a hat-trick and James Tedesco delivered a masterful performance at full-back. The Blues showcased slick ball handling and dynamic outside backs, leading 18-6 at half-time before extending their lead in the second half.

704	compare shell weight heavy artillery world war railway guns versus warship guns massive projectile size	The railway gun 'Cleo' used shells weighing a third of a ton, while the Japanese 14-inch naval guns fired various projectile types including APC Type 91 weighing 1,485 lbs (673.6 kg), Common Type 0 HE weighing 1,378 lbs (625 kg), and Common Type 3 IS weighing 1,485 lbs (673.6 kg). Both types represented massive artillery pieces - the railway gun weighing 85 tons total and the naval gun weighing around 189,586 lbs (86,000 kg).	"[""Barrington's memories of the School of Artillery\nAfter some weeks at Young Officers’ Course at the School of Artillery at Larkhill, with all the practical training at Salisbury Plain, I saw on the order board that I was being posted to the School of Super Heavy Railway Artillery at Catterick in Yorkshire. Having trained at the Officer Cadet Training Unit (OCTU) on 13-pounder guns last used in the First World War and on 18-pounder field guns again of First World War vintage when I was in the T.A., I had no idea what “Railway Super Heavy” meant.\nA tiresome and lonely journey by rail at 19 years of age and under war time conditions saw me ending up on the station at Catterick. On enquiry to the Rail Transport Officer (RTO) as to the location of the School of Super Heavy Railway Artillery, I was somewhat mystified to be informed he had never heard of it! Such was the chaotic state of affairs in this country at that time that I was beginning to wonder whether I myself was not the victim of some subversive movement!\nHowever, this rather nice old RTO with First World War ribbons suggested I go to the Royal Corps of Signals Headquarters’ mess in Catterick where I would be given accommodation. After a week or so, I was joined by a distinguished Captain R.A. with First World War medals on his chest and Observer Wings. He too had been directed to join the school of Super Heavy Railway Artillery and no-one seemed any the wiser what this meant.\nIn the course of the next week we were conducted by a team of London N.E. Railway officials, led by a red hat Brigadier General R.A., to the railway sheds at Darlington. It was there that we were introduced to massive 84 ton guns which had last seen action on the Somme, together with guns which had been taken off warships in the interim period between the two world wars in accordance with several naval treaties decreeing that guns of such calibre were no longer to be employed. Allegedly, they had been destroyed but, in fact, were preserved, minus the gun sights and range tables, in mineral jelly in railway sheds,\nIn a matter of weeks we were joined by chaps from coastal batteries, mainly Territorials, who had been employed on coastal defence and, like ourselves, had no experience of these particular “railway guns”. Eventually, I found myself as a Second Lieutenant in command of “Cleo”, one of the first two 12 inch railway Howitzers, with orders to be ready with gun crews and Sappers (Royal Engineer locomotive crews) to make our way down to the Dover area - presumably to repel the threat, that was now becoming very real, of a German invasion. Needless to say, we still had no such things as range tables, no gun sights or the technical equipment required for firing such ordnance!\nWe were billeted under canvas on the moors outside Catterick. As Troop Commander, I was privileged to be housed in a bell tent (including a camp bed and basin which my father had sent).\nIt took some time to travel down south. It was an arduous and prolonged journey, not least because the gun itself on its carriage weighed 85 tons and various bridges had to be reinforced before we could cross them! On route we stopped off at Immingham, near the mouth of the Humber, and we did fire some rounds. Indeed, these were very precious because there were not more than about 21 rounds of 12 inch ammunition suitable for this particular gun in the U.K. For this particular calibration exercise I found myself at the Dock tower at Grimsby taking part in spotting the fall of shot in the Humber estuary.\nThe gun members were not instructed to use earplugs but we were told how important it was to breathe out and relax the stomach muscles when the gun was fired. However, the evening newspaper for Immingham and Stalingborough did warn the citizens to leave their windows open the following morning. Indeed, our calibrating rounds smashed all the lamps and windows on Stalingborough railway station and several in the village.\nThe Duke of Kent (later killed flying with the RAF) visited us unexpectedly sometime between June and July and had breakfast in the mess railway coach. I was Orderly Officer of the day and turned out the guard to salute the car flying its pennant.\nEventually, in late August, we arrived at a little railway halt near Dover, at a village called Shepherdswell approx 12 miles from Dover. We shunted the gun into a siding and pushed it into a tunnel where we protected its position with barbed wire and First World War vintage Lewis guns (the troops themselves being armed with Ross Canadian rifles) while wondering what our fate would be.\nIn fact, from Shepherdswell we were to take the gun by rail closer to the Dover area. The air combat in S.E. England, particularly over Kent toward Canterbury and London, was critical at that time. The Battle of Britain was being fought out: parachutes were coming down quite frequently from the battles in the air and we did have German airmen in our guardroom on two occasions.\nAs already mentioned, this 85 ton gun “Cleo”, was one of two – its sister gun was called “Sheba”. Together they formed what was called the Fifth Super Heavy Battery.\nThe shell weighed a third of a ton. It had to be hoisted on the loading cradle and rammed into the breech. The breech block was then closed and the loaded gun elevated. There were sixteen men per gun and the whole crew was housed in a train comprising two carriages, one being the Officers’ Mess for the Battery Commander, the Command Post Officer and the two Gun Position Officers. The second carriage provided quarters for the two Warrant Officers plus cooking facilities. The other ranks were housed in bunks fitted into the old type wagons marked “40 hommes” or “8 chevaux” (relics of First World War days.)\nNext page 'Invasion Beckons'"", 'This could well be said to be the best battleship gun built by Japan, as it was quite accurate and reliable. The original design was by the famous British armament firm of Vickers and guns manufactured by that firm were first used to arm the battlecruiser Kongô, built at the Vickers-Armstrong yard at Barrow.\nNomenclature for these weapons is somewhat complicated. The original design was submitted by Vickers to the Japanese in November 1910. In an effort to hide their true size, Vickers designated these guns on their internal documents as the 12-in Vickers Mark ""J"" and the Japanese documented them as the 12-in Meiji 43 Type (the 43rd year of the Meiji era being 1910). Later, the guns built by Vickers were known as the 14-in Vickers Mark ""A"" and to the Japanese as the 14-in 43rd Year Type (Model 1910). Guns manufactured in Japan were known as 14-in 41st Year Type (Model 1908). In 1917, when the Japanese converted to metric, all of these guns were then designated as ""36 cm"" (14.2 inches) but their bores remained unchanged at 14.0 inches (35.6 cm). For more information on Japanese designations, see Gun Data.\nIn addition to those guns on Kongô, Vickers supplied a number of complete guns and individual forgings to the Japanese for a few years but most guns were built by Kure Arsenal and by Japan Steel Works, LTD (Muroran Plant). A total of about 100 guns from all sources were produced. There were several versions of the Japanese type, but they and the Vickers guns had similar performance and can be considered together. The Vickers guns were the customary full-length wire wound type and used cannelured rings at the tube shoulders to reduce ""steel choke"" problems. The early 41st Year Type guns were similar, but later ones are believed to have had the inner A tube radially expanded into position.

These should not be confused with the Common Type 3 Incendiary Shrapnel (IS) rounds used during World War II. The original Type 3 had a shimose filler and had a tendency to detonate on impact, similar to British shells of the era. It is probable that APC and CPC shells were also imported from Britain at this time but I have been unable to confirm that hypothesis.\n- IS is my abbreviation for the incendiary shrapnel round (sankaidan) intended for AA use.\n- The APC Type 3 was adopted in 1917. Following World War I, the Japanese obtained some German AP shells and also purchased some British Hadfield AP shells in 1924. Examination of these examples and the results of their own extensive firing trials resulted in the APC Type 5 which was adopted on 15 June 1925. This was superseded by the APC No. 6 which was adopted on 17 November 1928. APC No. 6 was essentially similar to the Type 5 in terms of armor penetration but was better protected from premature detonation and had enhanced underwater performance. APC No. 6 was redesignated as the Type 88 on 6 April 1931. On that same date, the improved APC Type 91 was adopted.\n- Type 91 shells were all 6 / [infinity] crh with boat tail and two copper driving bands. The diameter of the bourrelet was 13.970 in (35.484 cm). AP Cap, cap head and windshield together weighed 229 lbs. (104 kg).\n- The propellant charge was in four bags.\n- Dye for AP shells was introduced in 1941\nand these projectiles were designated as Type 1.

A later increase in the 1930s was achieved by deepening the gun wells and lowering the revolving structure deeper into the ships. Ise and Hyuga lacked sufficient depth in the aftmost two turrets to allow this last change, so only the four forward and amidships turrets were modified for greater elevations. It should be noted that even the original +25 degree elevation was greater than that of contemporary British designs which were generally limited to +15 or +20 degree elevations.\n- Q turret on the Kongô class was in a more favorable position than those on earlier British battlecruisers, increasing its firing arc to about 60 degrees before the beam and 90 degrees abaft it on either side, although it could not fire directly aft at elevations below about 10 degrees.\n- These mountings used Kenyon Doors to transfer projectiles onto the turret stalks. Auxiliary electric power was provided. Magazines were above the shell rooms in the original British design, although later ships and the modernized Kongôs had this arrangement reversed, showing the influence of a similar change in British thinking of the 1920s. Compressed air runout was added in the 1920s rebuilds.\n- The gun axes were 90 in (229 cm) apart.\n- The weight differences was mainly the result of thicker armor on the battleship turrets.\n- During gunnery practice on 5 May 1942, the left gun breech of Turret #5 on Hyuga suffered a catastrophic failure and the resulting explosion and fire killed fifty-one officers and crewmen. During repairs at Kure over the next few weeks, Turret #5 was removed from the ship and replaced with a circular armor plate atop the barbette. Four triple 25 mm gun mounts were placed on top of the plate. Later during 1943, the after two turrets and barbettes on Ise and Hyuga were removed and these ships were then converted into hybrid battleship-seaplane carriers. See the Naval Technical Board essay The Japanese Ise and Hyuga Hybrid Battleship-Carriers for additional information.\n- The US Naval Technical Mission to Japan report O-47(N)-1 states that ""Japanese major caliber turrets (14 and 16-inch) are all of old design and were copied from the British-built turrets for the BB Kongô. In general arrangement and in most details, they are similar to the British 15-inch turrets, but some improvements have been made by the Japanese . . .[including] Better flash tightness in gunhouses and working chambers.

1366	carciofi alla giudea history jewish ghetto rome	Carciofi Alla Giudea is a century-old Jewish delicacy from Rome that flourished in the Roman Jewish Ghetto. In 1555, Pope Paul IV ordered the construction of 'Il Ghetto di Roma' where the Jewish community lived under restrictions. Despite these limitations, Roman Jewish cuisine thrived, with frying becoming a practical cooking method due to the simple requirements of a frying pan, fire, and olive oil. The dish was traditionally prepared by Jewish women for the feast of Kippur.	['Carciofi Alla Giudea, a century-old fried Jewish delicacy from the eternal city of Rome boasts centuries and centuries of history. Since ancient times, the Jewish women prepared this dish on the occasion of the feast of Kippur, the feast of atonement.\nWhen spring arrives, around Easter or before, many Romans take a walk from Piazza Venezia or Trastevere to celebrate the beginning of the artichoke season. It is also the time when demand for the Jewish style artichokes explodes in the heart of the former Jewish Ghetto. Carciofi Alla Giudia is a popular dish in Rome, and also happens to be one of our favourites.\nCarciofi alla giudea or carciofi alla giudia\nFor me, to eat the Jewish style deep-fried artichokes becomes a matter of some urgency during a spring visit to Rome. Not only are they delicious, but they also represent a splendid tribute to the local Jewish food tradition that boasts centuries of history.\nThe Jewish community in Rome is the oldest known in Europe. Already in the year 161 BC, Judas Maccabaeus send emissaries to the Roman Empire. The community expands significantly after 70 AD when the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem by Emperor Titus’ troops in 70 AD created a flow of refugees and slaves. *Tip\nForced to live in Trastevere from the 10th century, Pope Paul IV ordered the construction of ‘Il Ghetto di Roma’ in 1555 on the other side of the river Tiber, in Rioni. Not just severely restricted by the cramped living quarters in dark, crumbling dwellings, Pope Paul IV also revoked all earlier rights granted to the Roman Jews.\nRestricted, yet deliciously creative\nAnd yet, it was in this restricted setting that the Roman Jewish cuisine flourished. In these circumstances, frying was the most sensible thing to do. You need a frying pan, a fire, and olive oil, lot’s of it. In poorly lit, ill-equipped kitchens the Roman Jews turned to humble ingredients and made them into appetizing dishes.\nVegetable fries or ‘fritto misto’\nFor the Roman Jewish ‘fritto misto’ -simple, fried, vegetable dishes- a wonderful chickpea batter (a local told me) was used to make them light, airy, and crispy. Fries were not only a means to eat kosher, non-cooked dishes on the Sabbath, selling ‘fritto misto’ or running a ‘friggitoria’ are one of the few means open to Roman Jews to earn some money.\nThe iconic ‘Alla Giudea’\nOf all the dishes you can eat in the Roman Jewish quarter, the artichoke received an iconic status. In ancient times, the Jewish women prepared this dish on the occasion of the feast of Kippur, the feast of atonement. Carciofi Alla Giudea – artichokes in the Jewish way is actually quite a simple dish if you use the right type of artichoke.\n‘Mammola’, and ‘Cimarolo’ artichoke\nIt is precisely for this reason that the ‘Mammola’, and ‘Cimarolo’ variety of artichoke is used. Roman artichokes are now PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) grown and protected.\nBoth cultivars do not have the classic thorns, thorns that must be removed in many other varieties. They are round and entirely edible. The softness of the leaves makes them perfect for frying as a whole. Some people prefer to use the smaller artichokes, located lower on the stalks, called ‘Figlioli’ – children- or even the tiny ones called ‘Nipoti’, grandchildren in English.\nPreparing the artichokes\nThe artichokes are trimmed with a knife to eliminate the outer leaves and the reddish tips. Some people then placed them in a bowl with water and lemon for 10 minutes. Take them out of the water, dry them, and season with salt and pepper. Two methods are used.\nHow to prepare carciofi alla giudia\nBeat two artichokes against each other. Then gently tap each artichoke on the work surface. This is necessary to remove the water and to facilitate the opening of the flower during cooking. Or bang the blossom of the artichoke down to loosen the tender leaves and coax the leaves to open slightly. The artichokes are then fried once in olive oil and left to rest.\nOthers think that to be truly Alla Giudia, the artichokes should be fried in oil (about 8-10 minutes). The oil should reach a temperature of about 130-150 °C, warm, but not boiling. Once cooled, the leaves should be coaxed gently to open outwards with a fork. Seasoned them inside with a little salt and pepper.\nServe hot eat whole\nAfter at least 10-15 minutes out of the oil, the artichokes are fried for a second time. Place the artichokes -again- in hot oil around 180 °C. The artichokes must be fried at a higher temperature than that the first fry. Fry them for a few minutes, don’t burn them. Remove from the oil and drain the artichokes on absorbent paper. Serve hot. Eat them whole.\nCarciofi & wine\nThink about a white wine such as a Vermentino di Gallura from Sardinia, a Traminer from the Alsace in France, a dry Muscat from Austria, or a dry Frascati Superiore. A red is a less good match because of the clash of tannins present in the wine, with tannins found in artichokes\n*Tip -Go and see the Arch of Titus, located on the Via Sacra, Rome. Titus’ arch depicts Romans carrying the spoils taken from the Temple in Jerusalem, including a Menorah, sacred trumpets and a showbread table']	['<urn:uuid:e6011d65-ca15-439c-91ed-26c49afbcbb6>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-02T11:45:30.494741	7	77	896
691	How much higher is the cancer risk with Lynch syndrome?	People with Lynch syndrome have significantly elevated cancer risks compared to the general population. They face a 20-fold greater risk of colorectal cancer, a 30-fold greater risk of endometrial cancer, a 19-fold higher risk of ovarian cancer, an 11-fold greater risk of kidney cancer, a 10-fold greater risk of pancreatic, stomach, and bladder cancers, and a four-fold greater risk of breast cancer.	"['Cancer risks associated with Lynch syndrome discovered\nAn international study led by the University of Melbourne has provided a clearer understanding of the cancer risks associated with the genetic mutation Lynch syndrome, a finding that could lead to earlier detection of a wide range of cancers in sufferers.\nPeople with Lynch syndrome have a genetic mutation that gives them a high risk of several types of cancer including bowel cancer. The genes that are damaged can’t repair any errors that occur in our DNA.\nThe study, which has been published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, confirmed the increased risk of cancers already known to be associated with Lynch syndrome, including colon, uterus, ovary, kidney, stomach, and bladder cancers. They also found those with Lynch syndrome faced a moderately increased risk of developing breast and pancreatic cancer.\nThe researchers, led by Dr Aung Ko Win, and Associate Professor Mark Jenkins, at The University of Melbourne’s School of Population Health, followed 450 people with a mutation in one of the four mismatch repair genes associated with Lynch syndrome, and more than 1000 of their relatives who were not carriers of these mutations. Study participants were evaluated every five years at recruitment centres affiliated with the Colon Cancer Family Registry in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US.\nAfter five years, those with Lynch syndrome had a 20-fold greater risk of colorectal cancer; a 30-fold greater risk of endometrial (uterine) cancer; a 19-fold higher risk of ovarian cancer; an 11-fold greater risk of kidney cancer; a 10-fold greater risk of pancreatic, stomach, and bladder cancers; and a four-fold greater risk of breast cancer. People with Lynch syndrome also tended to be diagnosed with these cancers at an earlier age than people in the general population.\nThe researchers said their findings regarding breast cancer were unexpected. They said further studies were needed to determine if ages at mammographic screening or methods such as use of MRI should be recommended for people with Lynch syndrome. Currently, individuals with Lynch syndrome typically undergo colonoscopy at an earlier age than the general population, but no other special screening regimens have been agreed upon.\nThis is also the largest study to date of cancer risk for non-carriers of family specific mutations.\n""Our study revealed that these people have an average risk of developing cancer as opposed to the high risk of their mutation-carrying close relatives and hence do not need to worry unnecessarily and over screen to detect cancer,"" said Associate Professor Jenkins.\n""While not a common condition, approximately 20,000 Australians have Lynch syndrome and a very high risk of cancer. Over time, as improved screening methods become available, the findings may help doctors refine screening guidelines for breast, uterus, colon and other cancers among patients with Lynch syndrome. In the meantime, genetic testing will give people a clearer indication of their real risk level and clarify what they could or should not do to reduce their risks of cancer.""\nPeople who think they might be at increased risk for cancer due to family history should attend a Family Cancer Clinics for genetic testing and advice so cancers can be detected and treated as early as possible.\nSource: University of Melbourne\nHave your say...\nThe approval of your comment is at the discretion of this article\'s publisher.

669	I'm curious about different ways that humans used animals for transportation in the past - what are some examples of how animals were used for moving people and goods?	Animals have been used in several ways for transport. People could either ride the animals directly, use them as pack animals to carry goods, or harness them alone or in teams to pull sleds or wheeled vehicles.	['Mode of transport is a term used to distinguish between different ways of transportation or transporting people or goods. The different modes of transport are air, water, and land transport, which includes Rails or railways, road and off-road transport. Other modes also exist, including pipelines, cable transport, and space transport. Human-powered transport and animal-powered transport are sometimes regarded as their own mode, but never fall into the other categories. In general, transportation is used for moving of people, animals, and other goods from one place to another. The means of transport, on the other hand, refers to the (motorized) vehicles necessary for transport according to the chosen mode (car, airplane, ship, truck and rail). Each mode of transport has a fundamentally different technological solution, and some require a separate environment. Each mode has its own infrastructure, vehicles, and operations.\nAnimal-powered transport is the use of working animals for the transport of people and/or goods. Humans may use some of the animals directly, use them as pack animals for carrying goods, or harness them, alone or in teams, to pull sleds or wheeled vehicles.\nA fixed-wing aircraft, typically airplane, is a heavier-than-air flying vehicle, in which the special geometry of the wings generates lift and then lifts the whole vehicle. Fixed-wing aircraft range from small trainers and recreational aircraft to large airliners and military cargo aircraft. For short distances or in places without runways, helicopters can be operable. (Other types of aircraft, like autogyros and airships, are not a significant portion of air transport.)\nAir transport is the fastest method of transport, Commercial jets reach speeds of up to 955 kilometres per hour (593 mph) and a considerably higher ground speed if there is a jet stream tailwind, while piston-powered general aviation aircraft may reach up to 555 kilometres per hour (345 mph) or more. This celerity comes with higher cost and energy use, and aviation’s impacts to the environment and particularly the global climate require consideration when comparing modes of transportation. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates a commercial jet’s flight to have some 2-4 times the effect on the climate than if the same CO2 emissions were made at ground level, because of different atmospheric chemistry and radiative forcing effects at the higher altitude. U.S. airlines alone burned about 16.2 billion gallons of fuel during the twelve months between October 2013 and September 2014. WHO estimates that globally as many as 500,000 people at a time are on planes. The global trend has been for increasing numbers of people to travel by air, and individually to do so with increasing frequency and over longer distances, a dilemma that has the attention of climate scientists and other researchers, the press, and the World Wide Web. The issue of impacts from frequent travel, particularly by air because of the long distances that are easily covered in one or a few days, is called hypermobility and has been a topic of research and governmental concern for many years.\nHuman powered transport, a form of sustainable transportation, is the transport of people and/or goods using human muscle-power, in the form of walking, running and swimming. Modern technology has allowed machines to enhance human power. Human-powered transport remains popular for reasons of cost-saving, leisure, physical exercise, and environmentalism; it is sometimes the only type available, especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions.\nAlthough humans are able to walk without infrastructure, the transport can be enhanced through the use of roads, especially when using the human power with vehicles, such as bicycles and inline skates. Human-powered vehicles have also been developed for difficult environments, such as snow and water, by watercraft rowing and skiing; even the air can be entered with human-powered aircraft.\nLand transport covers all land-based transportation systems that provide for the movement of people, goods and services. Land transport plays a vital role in linking communities to each other. Land transport is a key factor in urban planning. It consists of 2 kinds, rail and road.\nRail transport is a means of conveyance of passengers and goods by way of wheeled vehicles running on rail track, known as a railway or railroad. The rails are anchored perpendicular to railroad train consists of one or more connected vehicles that run on the rails. Propulsion is commonly provided by a locomotive, that hauls a series of unpowered cars, that can carry passengers or freight. The locomotive can be powered by steam, diesel or by electricity supplied by trackside systems. Alternatively, some or all the cars can be powered, known as a multiple unit. Also, a train can be powered by horses, cables, gravity, pneumatics and gas turbines. Railed vehicles move with much less friction than rubber tires on paved roads, making trains more energy efficient, though not as efficient as ships.\nIntercity trains are long-haul services connecting cities; modern high-speed rail is capable of speeds up to 430 km/h (270 mph), but this requires a specially built track. Regional and commuter trains feed cities from suburbs and surrounding areas, while intra-urban transport is performed by high-capacity tramways and rapid transits, often making up the backbone of a city’s public transport. Freight trains traditionally used box cars, requiring manual loading and unloading of the cargo. Since the 1960s, container trains have become the dominant solution for general freight, while large quantities of bulk are transported by dedicated trains.\nA road is an identifiable route of travel, usually surfaced with gravel, asphalt or concrete, and supporting land passage by foot or by a number of vehicles.\nThe most common road vehicle in the developed world is the automobile, a wheeled passenger vehicle that carries its own motor. As of 2002, there were 591 million automobiles worldwide. Other users of roads include motorcars, motorcycles, buses, trucks, bicycles and pedestrians, and special provisions are sometimes made for each of these. For example, the use of bus lanes give priority for public transport, and cycle lanes provide special areas of road for bicycles to use.\nMotorcars offer high flexibility, but are deemed with high energy and area use, and the main source of noise and air pollution in cities; buses allow for more efficient travel at the cost of reduced flexibility. Road transport by truck is often the initial and final stage of freight transport.\nWater transport is the process of transport that a watercraft, such as a barge, boat, ship or sailboat, makes over a body of water, such as a sea, ocean, lake, canal or river. If a boat or other vessel can successfully pass through a waterway it is known as a navigable waterway. The need for buoyancy unites watercraft, and makes the hull a dominant aspect of its construction, maintenance and appearance. When a boat is floating on the water the hull of the boat is pushing aside water where the hull now is, this is known as displacement.\nIn the 1800s, the first steamboats were developed, using a steam engine to drive a paddle wheel or propeller to move the ship. The steam was produced using wood or coal. Now, most ships have an engine using a slightly refined type of petroleum called bunker fuel. Some ships, such as submarines, use nuclear power to produce the steam. Recreational or educational craft still use wind power, while some smaller craft use internal combustion engines to drive one or more propellers, or in the case of jet boats, an inboard water jet. In shallow draft areas, hovercraft are propelled by large pusher-prop fans.\nAlthough slow, modern sea transport is a highly effective method of transporting large quantities of non-perishable goods. Commercial vessels, nearly 35,000 in number, carried 7.4 billion tons of cargo in 2007. Transport by water is significantly less costly than air transport for transcontinental shipping;short sea shipping and ferries remain viable in coastal areas.\nMicromobility is the collective name for small electric powered vehicles.\nPipeline transport sends goods through a pipe, most commonly liquid and gases are sent, but pneumatic tubes can also send solid capsules using compressed air. For example liquids/gases, any chemically stable liquid or gas can be sent through a pipeline. Short-distance systems exist for sewage, slurry water and beer, while long-distance networks are used for petroleum and natural gas.\nCable transport is a broad mode where vehicles are pulled by cables instead of an internal power source. It is most commonly used at steep gradient. Typical solutions include aerial tramway, elevators, escalator and ski lifts; some of these are also categorized as conveyor transport.\nSpace transport is transport out of Earth’s atmosphere into outer space by means of a spacecraft. While large amounts of research have gone into technology, it is rarely used except to put satellites into orbit, and conduct scientific experiments. However, Man has landed on the moon, and probes have been sent to all the planets of the Solar System.\nUnmanned aerial vehicle transport (drone transport) is being used for medicine transportation in least developed countries with inadequate infrastructure by an american based start-up Zipline.Amazon.com and other transportation companies are currently testing the use of unmanned aerial vehicles in parcel delivery. This method will allow short-range small-parcel delivery in a short time frame.\nComponents of a mode of transport\nA transport mode is a combination of the following:\n- Transportation infrastructure: thoroughfares, networks, hubs (stations, bus terminals, airport terminals), etc.\n- Vehicles and containers: motor vehicles, automobiles, motorcycles, trucks, wagons, trains, ships, and aircraft\n- A stationary or mobile workforce\n- Propulsion system and power supply (traction)\n- Operations: driving, management, traffic signals, railway signalling, air traffic control, etc.\nPurpose of Transport : Freight & Passenger movement and mobility are core components of a transport system.\nComparison of the transport mode by distance travelled\nWorldwide, the most widely used modes for passenger transport are the Automobile (16,000 bn passenger km), followed by Buses (7,000), Air (2,800), Railways (1,900), and Urban Rail (250).\nThe most widely used modes for freight transport are Sea (40,000 bn ton km), followed by Road (7,000), Railways (6,500), Oil pipelines (2,000) and Inland Navigation (1,500).\n|GDP (PPP) per capita (€)||19,000||28,600||26000||7500|\n|Passenger km per capita|\n|Air (domestic except World)||860||2,800||580||480|\n- Cooper et al., 1998: 281\n- Swine flu prompts EU warning on travel to the US.

1316	how virtual switches handle data plane without specialized hardware	Virtual switches, while lacking specialized hardware for a high-speed data path, still maintain a data plane by using software techniques such as special data structures and optimized kernels to provide the forwarding path.	['Control and Data Planes\nLast Updated: [last-modified] (UTC)\nThe control and data planes do not describe data itself. Rather, these planes describe how the device handles the data. For example, does the device process a packet itself, or does it forward it to another device?\nTo make matters more tricky, each device may see the traffic ins a different way. One device may classify traffic as data plane traffic. Another may classify the same traffic as part of the control plane.\nThe lines between the control and data plane can get blurry sometimes. The following sections will attempt to separate the two.\nThe control plane is generally considered to be where a router or switch makes its decisions. This is software based, and uses the CPU rather than specialised hardware, such as an ASIC.\nFor this reason, many people call the control plane the ‘slow path’.\nRemember how the planes refer to how a device handles traffic? Well, traffic sent to a device or generated on a device is control plane traffic. An example of this is when a router forms neighbour relationships in OSPF or EIGRP. Or, when switches share BPDU’s for spanning-tree.\nControl Plane traffic is sent to a device, or generated on a device\nAnother function of the control plane is to assign resources to the data plane. An example of this is using the data from the RIB to populate the FIB.\nA logical subset of the control plane is the Management Plane. Any management traffic for the local device (such as SSH) is part of the management plane. This is because the destination of the management traffic is the local device.\nThe data plane (or forwarding plane) is the high speed path through the router/switch. Packets that pass through the device use the data plane, as opposed to packets directed to the device. For this reason, the data plane is also called the forwarding plane.\nData Plane traffic is forwarded through a device\nThe data plane need to provide a high speed and low latency path. To achieve this, a lot of data plane implementation is in hardware. This includes performing CEF lookups/caching, and using special ASICs. The FIB and LFIB are part of the data plane.\nWant to see how ASIC’s work?\nVirtual switches are a little bit different. They don’t generally have specialised hardware to create a high-speed data path. This does not mean that they don’t have a data plane. Software techniques, such as special data structures and optimised kernels, provide the forwarding path.\nBut what about management traffic? What if it passes through a switch or router, destined for another device? This traffic is being forwarded, so for this device, it uses the forwarding plane (or data plane).\nA few quick examples;\n- SSH to a router; Control Plane\n- Passing SSH traffic through to another device; Data Plane\n- BGP neighbour relationship; Control Plane\n- Forwarding BGP traffic; Data Plane\n- OSPF neighbourships and building the LSDB; Control Plane\nA special case would be when the control and data planes span across a ‘fabric’. An example of this is a spine/leaf topology in a data centre. In this case, BGP EVPN provides a distributed control plane. But that’s a topic worthy of its own article.']	['<urn:uuid:4e79bdb8-5e04-4ac3-933b-87b56fca8236>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-02T11:45:30.494741	9	33	545
993	What does research show about the patterns of transmission for people who get infected with West Nile virus compared to those with measles-related brain inflammation?	West Nile virus encephalitis does not spread easily from person to person, although it can be spread by transfusion or organ transplant. In contrast, measles encephalitis spreads very easily among unvaccinated people.	['Meningoencephalitis, Viral encephalitis, West Nile encephalitis\nIntroduction to encephalitis:\nWest Nile virus frightens many parents because it can cause a type of infection called encephalitis.\nWhat is encephalitis?\nMeningitis is primarily an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord, and sometimes of the brain itself. Encephalitis is primarily an inflammation of the brain.\nMost of the time, the inflammation is caused by viral infections. West Nile virus rapidly spread across the United States at the turn of the 21st century as a cause of encephalitis, but enteroviruses are far and away the most common cause. Arboviruses and herpes are also common. West Nile virus is an arbovirus.\nWho gets encephalitis?\nAnyone can get encephalitis. It tends to be more common in the summer and fall. Some types are found in those who are bitten by infected mosquitoes or other insects. Some types are found in those who get infected stool particles in their mouths. Some types are found in those who just spend time in the same room as someone infected with the virus.\nWhat are the symptoms of encephalitis?\nThe symptoms of encephalitis can vary quite a bit, from those of a very mild illness to coma or sudden death. A severe headache is usually the central symptom. Often there is sensitivity to light. There may be a fever, vomiting, fatigue, and/or irritability. With some viruses there is a characteristic rash. Neck pain, back pain, and leg pain are common.\nIn some, there are severe seizures, hallucinations, and loss of bowel or bladder control. Even these children may recover completely with no lasting problems.\nIs encephalitis contagious?\nSome types of encephalitis, such as that caused by West Nile virus, do not spread easily from person to person, although they can be spread by transfusion or organ transplant. Other encephalitis viruses, such as measles, spread very easily among unvaccinated people.\nHow long does encephalitis last?\nThese infections may be brief or prolonged. Children may recover completely or suffer lifelong consequences.\nHow is encephalitis diagnosed?\nThe diagnosis is suspected based on the history and physical examination. Lab tests of the spinal fluid or blood may be helpful. EEGs or imaging studies of the brain may help in making the diagnosis and evaluating the severity of the disease. Sometimes specific viral studies are helpful.\nHow is encephalitis treated?\nEncephalitis may be so mild as to require only rest, fluids, and something for the headache — or it may require intensive care and full life-support.\nSome types of encephalitis, such as that caused by herpes, require specific antiviral therapy.\nHow can encephalitis be prevented?\nMeasles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, and even rabies encephalitis may be prevented by appropriately timed vaccines. Other types of encephalitis may be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites.\nFecal-oral transmission precautions are the best way to prevent enteroviral infections, the most common cause of encephalitis in places where vaccines are commonly used. Careful hand washing before eating and after toileting or diaper changes is essential. This is an important hygiene lesson to teach our children.\nRelated A-to-Z Information:\nAirborne Transmission, Arboviruses, Arthritis (Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, JRA), Body-Fluid Transmission, Chickenpox (Varicella), CMV (Cytomegalovirus), Cold Sores (Herpes simplex), Coxsackievirus, Deafness, Dehydration, Enteroviruses, Epilepsy, Exanthems (Childhood rash), Febrile seizures, Fecal-Oral Transmission, Headache, Herpes Simplex, HIV, Human Herpesvirus, Lyme Disease, Measles, Meningitis, Mononucleosis (Mono), Mumps, Polio, Rabies, Rubella (German measles), Smallpox, Ticks, Vomiting']	['<urn:uuid:0d7f1082-5924-41d9-b224-96054345bbdf>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-02T10:56:22.807332	25	32	561
831	What are the key differences between how a Property and Financial Affairs LPA and a conservator handle someone's financial matters?	A Property and Financial Affairs LPA can manage finances and property including buying and selling property, managing investments, paying bills, and collecting benefits, based on the authority granted by the donor. A conservator has more specific and court-regulated powers - they can perform many financial tasks without court authorization (like investing funds, depositing money, making repairs, and paying taxes), but need prior court authorization for certain actions like operating a business or disposing of real estate. Additionally, conservators must file an inventory within 90 days of appointment and provide accountings to the court at least every three years, while LPAs don't have these specific reporting requirements.	['What is a Lasting Power of Attorney?\nA Lasting Power of Attorney allows your loved ones to take care of you and your finances if you become unable to do so yourself.\nThere are two types of LPA:\n- A “Property and Financial Affairs” Lasting Power of Attorney gives your Attorney the authority to deal with buying and selling your property, your bills, bank accounts and investments.\n- A “Health and Welfare” Lasting Power of Attorney covers decisions about health and care and even deciding where someone is to live. This can only be used if someone is incapable of dealing with such matters themselves.\nAn LPA ensures that, should you be unable to manage your own affairs, the people you have appointed can manage your financial life on your behalf. This can save a great deal of money and distress, and will ensure that, as a vulnerable person, your affairs will be handled correctly and quickly.\nIf you lose mental capacity without an LPA in place, it will be necessary for your family to apply to the Court of Protection to have a deputy appointed to deal with everyday financial matters. This is a slow and very expensive process, costing thousands of pounds.\nJoint bank, building society and business accounts can be severely restricted if ONE of the account holders loses mental capacity and there is no registered LPA in place. The 2013 British Bank Association booklet entitled “Guidance for People Wanting to Manage a Bank Account for Someone Else”, states: ‘If one joint account holder loses mental capacity, banks and building societies can decide whether or not to temporarily restrict the use of the account to essential transactions only’ .\nThe restricting of a joint account has severe implications as the joint owner cannot freely withdraw what is their own money without an order from the Court of Protection. This could be devastating, especially if the joint owner has their only form of income, such as their pension, paid into this joint account.\nWhat can we help you with?\n- Property sale\n- Paying bills\n- Benefit or income collections\n- Dealing with financial affairs on your behalf\n- Providing care in the event of an accident\nIn addition to power of attorney, we can provide legal advice regarding probate laws and trusts.\nWho can be your power of attorney?\nAs we grow older, we become prone to illness and need a power of attorney to handle our financial matters efficiently. You can choose your close friend, relative or a legal professional as your lasting power of attorney. It’s important that you choose your power of attorney very carefully because he or she will act on your behalf regarding your financial and personal welfare matters.\nLasting Powers Of Attorney\nThere may be a time when you may need someone to help you manage your property and affairs or personal welfare. This could be due to age, ill health or a loss of capacity.\nAn LPA is a legal document that lets you (the Donor – also known as ‘the person giving this Lasting Power of Attorney’) choose a person/persons (Attorney/Attorneys) that you trust to make decisions on your behalf at a future time when you may not be able to make such decisions due to mental incapacity or simply no longer wish to make such decisions.\nYou can create two types of LPA:\n• Property and Financial Affairs LPA\n• Health and Welfare LPA\nProperty & Financial Affairs LPA\nThis allows the Donor to appoint an Attorney to manage their finances and property. An appointed Attorney can make any decision the Donor could make about his or her property and affairs such as buying and selling property, managing investments, paying bills, collecting benefits or other income – unless restrictions are included to the contrary.\nThese are also useful documents for business owners who are sole traders, partners and also sole directors/shareholders.\nHealth & Welfare LPA\nThis allows the Donor to appoint an Attorney to make decisions about personal welfare. This document can only be used when the Donor has lost mental capacity. Unless restrictions are included, the Attorney can do anything the Donor would have done regarding personal welfare, for example:\n• Where you should live and who with\n• Day to day care\n• Consenting and refusing medical treatment\n• Arranging treatments such as dentists, doctors etc\n• Life sustaining treatment decisions can also be given to the Attorney, but only if the Donor directs\nWho Can Make An LPA?\nAnyone aged 18 years or over with capacity.\nWho Can Act As My Attorney(s)?\nAnyone can be appointed as a person’s Attorney so long as they are over the age of 18 years, have capacity and are not bankrupt. You can appoint more than one person to act. If you choose to appoint more than one then you have to decide how to appoint them. You can also appoint a substitute just in case something happens to an Attorney in your lifetime.\nAttorneys should be trustworthy and have a duty to act in your best interests and consider your needs and wishes so far as this is possible.\nWhat Happens If I Don’t Have An LPA?\nIf you lose the capacity to be able to manage your affairs for whatever reason without a valid LPA then your personal affairs will become the responsibility of the Office of the Public Guardian. In these cases a person’s affairs are placed under the jurisdiction of the Court who appoints a Deputy to act on your behalf and the Deputy is therefore answerable to the Court.\nThis can be an expensive route as Court approval is required for any act to be carried out, accounts have to be submitted to the Court every 12 months and financial decisions are not carried out by close family or friends.', 'Conservators and Guardians\nWhat is a Conservator?\nA person who is appointed by the court to manage the property of a minor or incapacitated person.\nWho is an incapacitated person?\nA person who is unable to manage property and business affairs because of:\n- Mental Illness\n- Mental Deficiency\n- Physical Illness\n- Infirmities accompanying advanced Age\n- Chronic Use of Drugs\n- Chronic Intoxication\n- Detention by Foreign Power\nWho can serve as a conservator?\nA family member or any interested person with the priorities as follows:\n- A conservator appointed in another jurisdiction\n- A person designated by the incapacitated person\n- A person designated by an incapacitated person’s power of attorney\n- Adult Child\n- Relative with whom ward has lived for the last six months\n- Nominee of a person caring for an incapacitated person\n- General guardian or sheriff\nWhen can a Conservator be appointed?\nA conservator may be appointed when an incapacitated person meets the following criteria:\n- Is unable to manage property and business affairs\n- Has property that will be wasted without proper management (or) Funds are needed to support the incapacitated person or one entitled to support from the incapacitated person.\nWhat are the powers and duties of a conservator?\nWithout court authorization the conservator may:\n- Invest and reinvest funds\n- Retain assets\n- Receive additions\n- Acquire undivided interest\n- Deposit funds in financial institutions\n- Acquire property\n- Dispose of personal property\n- Make repairs to a building\n- Enter leases up to 5 years\n- Enter mineral leases\n- Grant options up to one year\n- Vote securities\n- Pay assessments\n- Sell or exercise stock options\n- Deposit stocks and bonds\n- Consent to reorganization, a merger of a business\n- Insure assets\n- Borrow to protect estate\n- Settle claims\n- Pay reasonable annual compensation to the conservator\n- Pay taxes and expenses\n- Allocate expenses to income\n- Pay sum for benefit of the protected person or his family\n- Employ attorneys, auditors\n- Prosecute or defend claims\n- Execute and deliver appropriate instruments\n- Hold securities (court may limit powers of a conservator)\nWith prior court authorization the conservator may:\n- Continue or participate in operating business\n- Demolish improvements\n- Dispose of real estate\n- Subdivide, dedicate land\n- Leases greater than 5 years\n- Grant an option for more than one year\n- Take an option to acquire property\nAm I required to have a Lawyer?\nThe legal complexity of guardianships and conservatorships normally necessitates having an attorney since the Probate Judge cannot advise you of the law or provide you with forms.\nWhat is the difference between a guardian and a conservator?\nThe guardian looks after the person and their welfare while a conservator looks after their estate.\nWhat are the steps followed in appointing a guardian or conservator for an adult?\n- Petition filed\n- Appointment of guardian ad litem\n- Examination by physician\n- Appointment of court’s representative\n- A jury at hearing if demanded\n- Bond for conservator\n- Order granting petition\n- Letters of guardianship and/or conservatorship\n- Inventory of property for the conservator\nIs a bond required?\nYes, a bond is required for conservatorships unless the bond requirement was waived in a Will or Power of Attorney.\nIs an inventory required?\nEach conservator must complete an inventory of the estate immediately and file it with the court within 90 days after the appointment.\nAre accountings required?\nYes, a conservator must give an accounting to the court at least every three years.

1229	required steps joining catholic church new member	For those who have never been baptized, the path follows the Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults (RCIA). It begins with an 'Inquiry' period to learn about Catholic Church teachings, meet people, and experience parish life. This is followed by an extended period of deepening understanding, including participation in Sunday Mass and weekly gatherings.	"[""For adults, there are two paths for becoming Catholic. One is for those who have never been baptized, and the other is for those who have been validly baptized in another Christian Denomination and who now wish to consider living their baptismal life according to the belief and practice of the Roman Catholic Church.\nPath For Those Who Have Never Been Baptized\nThe path for those who have never been baptized follows what is called the Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults (RCIA). This is the norm for the entire Catholic Church and is the restoration of the way people in the early Church were prepared for full initiation. It begins with a period called “Inquiry” which is a time to look at the main teachings of the Catholic Church, to get to know some of the people and to begin to experience the life and prayer of the local church which is the parish. It is also the time for you to look at your life to see if this is the time for you to move further along the path of committing your life to Jesus in faith and living that faith as a member of the Catholic Church.\nIf this is your desire, you will begin an extended period of time to deepen your understanding of salvation which is offered to us through Jesus. Participation in Sunday Mass is essential as well as weekly gatherings to help you grow in understanding about living as a committed follower of Jesus according to Catholic belief and practice.\nFull membership in the Catholic Church takes place through the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation and Eucharist which are channels of God's life and help coming to us. These sacraments are celebrated together each year at the Easter Vigil which begins after dark the night before Easter. They bring us fully into the life and mission of Jesus as lived by the Church.\nPersonal Experience of Being Baptized and Living the Catholic Way of Life\nLun grew up in a Buddhist environment and came to the United States as an adult. She gradually learned about Christianity from those around her. She was Baptized, Confirmed, and received her First Communion during the Easter Vigil in 2014. She gave Sister Mary Catherine permission to put her story on this website.\nPath For Those Validly Baptized in Another Christian Denomination\nThis path varies from parish to parish. We have a group here that we call Pilgrim's Progress because we are all pilgrims on the journey of faith. This group consists of people who are baptized and are seeking to grow in their understanding of what it means to live as a baptized follower of Jesus.\nAmong the participants in the group are those from various Christian Churches who are exploring what it would mean for them to live their baptismal life according to Catholic belief and practice. The length of preparation time depends on the extent of their Christian background. When they are ready, they are received into the Full Communion of the Catholic Church at one of the weekend Masses by making a Profession of Faith, being Confirmed, and receiving Holy Communion.\nPersonal Experience of Coming into the Catholic Church\nMary was baptized in another Christian denomination and her husband Rob was baptized Catholic as a baby, but was not confirmed and was away from the active practice of his faith for awhile. Mary was received into Full Communion of the Catholic Church, Confirmed and received her First Communion at a Sunday Mass in 2014. Rob was Confirmed when Bishop Bradley came to the parish in May 2014 to celebrate Confirmation for those who were baptized Catholic. They gave permission to Sister Mary Catherine to put their story on this website.""]"	['<urn:uuid:6ec192df-c782-498e-8dda-cbf463a119ab>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-02T11:30:12.866257	7	54	626
962	Did forensics involve cameras before bullet analysis?	No, forensic photography was first used in the nineteenth century by Alphonse Bertillon, while the first documented use of bullet comparison in law enforcement was in 1835 by Henry Goddard of Scotland Yard who traced a bullet back to its mold.	['There are many methods of solving crime. Forensic Photography plays a vital role in solving a crime or narrowing down the investigation. Reproduction and reconstruction of the crime scene have an aspect to solve the crime. When a crime occurs and there is a crime scene, one of the first things that must have done is to take pictures of the actual crime scene even before the evidence is even touched. It forms a permanent visual record of the crime scene. The first use of forensic photography was in the nineteenth century by Alphonse Bertillon. This makes him the first forensic photographer. Forensic photography helps the investigator to solve or prevent crime or any further tampering of evidences from the sealed scene of the crime by the accused or any suspect and exonerate the innocent. It can also capture evidence that can’t physically be collected. The crime scene is photographed to minimize the risk of conflicting statements. Attempting to decipher numerous photography evidence taken at the crime scene presents a multitude of questions and, through investigating the answers, helps to reach the suspect. A forensic photographer must photograph everything, in case it will need to be used as evidence in court. All the photography must take place before the evidence has the chance to be disturbed.\nFactors to consider include identification, background lighting, color, scale, perspective, orientation, cropping, case number, evidence number, north indicator, etc. Once a crime scene has been established, it is important that all evidence is collected, categorized, and recorded for further reference. This task is normally performed by the crime scene officer and is carried out using a variety of methods. The means by which crime scenes are photographed are such that the most intricate details can be recorded and there are many types of lens, camera, and indeed light that can be used for this purpose and even light that can be used in certain scenarios. Basic steps include securing the incident scene, evaluation of conditions, shooting the scene, photographing the victims, photographing critical victims later, capturing the evidence by placing evidence marker, re-shoot for new evidence, imaging and lighting techniques setting include a macro lens, micro-lens, alternate light sources, oblique angle lighting.\nAll crime scene photograph photographs must contain three elements: the subject, a scale, and a reference object, and also overall forensic photography must be shown a neutral and accurate representation. Required equipment for photography include:\n- Camera: The crime scene photographer uses a high-quality digital camera or 35mm camera.\n- Normal lens: It provides the best perspective. 55mm lens is considered a normal lens for a 35mm camera.\n- Wide-angle lens: It is needed when photographing small rooms or other space constricted areas. A 28mm lens is considered a wide-angle lens for a 35mm camera.\n- Close up lens: close up accessories include 1:1 adapter, extension tubes, bellows, reversing rings or close up filters.\n- Filters: A polarizing filter is often needed for photographing through the glass and into water. Coloured filter is useful for some types of evidence with black and white films.\n- Electronic flash: It provides additional light that is often needed when photographing indoors, outdoors at night, filtering in shadows in bright daylight scenes and lighting evidence.\n- Tripod: Tripods are necessary to steady the camera for long exposure and for positioning the camera during certain types of evidence photography.\n- Film: Medium-speed color print film is most often used for crime scene photography. Black and white film is used for a certain type of photography.\nThe forensic photographer starts by taking overall overviews of the scene, providing a context, and they slowly move in to take midrange shots and closeups of specific areas of interest. They must frame images carefully to retain relevance and scale, and they may include evidence of markers, rulers, and other tools to provide context and references. Crime scene photographers try to work without disturbing the scene so that detectives can see an untainted scene, and they also document the investigation of the crime scene, including the tagging and removal of evidence. Certain factors are necessary to yield proper photographs. They are:\n- Camera International Standards Organisation (ISO)\n- Flash or external light source\n- Depth of the field\nTypes of photography include:\n- Surveillance: photographing in secrecy of person, activity, or location.\n- Mobile: taking a picture from a mobile phone using inbuilt features such as wide-angle mode, panorama, etc\n- High dynamic range: Zoom lens, Ultra-wide-angle lens is used. It reproduces a greater dynamic range of luminosity.\n- Macro-photography: macro-lens is used.\n- Micro-photography: micro-lens is used.\n- Infrared photography: IR filter through a narrow aperture, slow shutter speed is required. Biological waste such as urine, blood and sperm can also be seen despite being invisible to the naked eye.\n- Ultraviolet photography: By using light from UV spectrum, 2 types: 1) Reflected UV 2) Induced fluorescence photography. Bruises, tattoo marks, etc can be revealed.\nCrime scene investigators rely on forensic photos to continuous investigate the crime. Sometimes they can get narrow the investigation by seeing crime photos. It will refresh the memory of the investigator by seeing the photos of crime. It is important for showing a jury the same thing so that they can have more of a feel for what the evidence looked like at the crime. The photographer must be able to use the best photographic techniques in order to obtain the result. Investigators are finding new ways to use photography both as a tool for investigation and as a means to record data quickly. Photography can produce evidence much faster and evidence produced is unbeatable and beyond any doubt.\n- S.L.

1271	how scientists track monitor bee movement behavior research methods	Scientists use multiple methods to track bee behavior. Traditionally, they painted bees with color codes and monitored their movements via cameras. Now, they use radio-frequency identification (RFID) micro-sensor 'backpacks' measuring 2.5mm x 2.5mm and weighing about 5 milligrams, which record when bees pass checkpoints. Additionally, tools like Beescape.org allow researchers to monitor bee movement patterns up to 5 kilometers away from their hives and assess landscape quality factors affecting their health.	['Introducing Beescape: A new online tool and community to support bees\nUNIVERSITY PARK– A new online tool and community, called Beescape, enables beekeepers, or anyone interested in bees, to understand the specific stressors to which the bees in their managed hives, home gardens or farms are exposed, according to researchers at Penn State.\n“Pollinators, particularly bees, play a vital role in supporting ecosystems in agricultural, urban and natural landscapes,” said Christina Grozinger, Distinguished Professor of Entomology and director of the Center for Pollinator Research in Penn State’s College of Agricultural Sciences. “Nearly 90 percent of flowering plant species use pollinators to set seed and fruit, which animals — including humans — rely on for food.”\nYet Pennsylvania beekeepers lose nearly 50 percent of their honey bee colonies each winter, Grozinger added, and several wild bee species — including the bumble bee Bombus pensylvanicus — are threatened or endangered. These trends are occurring across the United States and around the world.\n“We know that bee populations are declining because of several key stressors, including exposure to insecticides, reduced abundance and diversity of the flowering plants that bees depend on for their food, and loss of nesting habitat for wild bees,” she said.\nGrozinger noted that bees travel large distances — several kilometers from their hives in the case of honey bees — to find food for their babies. But it has been nearly impossible for a beekeeper, or anyone interested in understanding what the bees in their backyards or farms are experiencing, to know what stressors their bees might encounter during their trips.”\nGrozinger and her colleagues designed Beescape.org to answer these questions. Previous work by members of the research team created methods to estimate the forage quality, nesting habitat quality and insecticide load in a landscape.\nBeescape.org allows users to select a specific location — the apiary where they house their honey bee colonies, their home garden or their farm — and obtain these landscape-quality scores for the surrounding region, up to 5 kilometers away. Users also can examine the crops that are being grown in the areas around them.\n“Beescape allows people to see the world as a bee, which will help them make decisions about where to place their colonies or steps they and their neighbors can take, such as planting pollinator gardens or reducing insecticide use, to make the landscape more friendly for bees,” said project collaborator Maggie Douglas, an assistant professor at Dickinson College in Carlisle.\nImportantly, noted Grozinger, Beescape enables researchers to partner with beekeepers and gardeners to gather information about how their bees are doing. The data generated from this partnership and community of collaborators will help researchers to better calculate how these landscape-quality scores translate to health outcomes for bees.\n“With data provided by beekeepers from agricultural, rural and urban landscapes across multiple states, we will be able to develop high-quality predictive models that will be included in the website in the future,” said Melanie Kammerer Allen, a graduate student in ecology at Penn State, who is involved in the project. “This will allow beekeepers to determine if they should provide the bees with supplementary food, for example, or for a grower to decide if they should add pollinator nesting habitat near their crops.”\nThe team collaborated with Azavea, a Philadelphia-based company that designs civic geospatial software and data analytics for the web, to develop the site.\nThe site currently has map information for Pennsylvania, Indiana and Illinois, and the team plans to include additional states in the future. Beekeepers and individuals with wild bee hotels in their backyards are encouraged to join the Beescape.org community and help provide information on the health of their bees.\nBeescape is a partnership led by Penn State’s College of Agricultural Sciences, Center for Pollinator Research and Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences. Other collaborators include Eric Lonsdorf, a lead scientist at the University of Minnesota’s Institute on the Environment; Harland Patch, research scientist, Doug Sponsler, postdoctoral fellow, and Kate Anton, research technician, all with the Penn State Department of Entomology; Adam Dolezal, assistant professor at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign; and Brock Harpur, assistant professor at Purdue University.\nThe research was supported by funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, the Foundation for Food and Agricultural Research, and the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center.\nTo learn more, visit Beescape.org or Penn State’s Center for Pollinator Research at https://ento.psu.edu/pollinators.', '- Micro-sensors attached to thousands of bees to help investigate their health.\n- Bees are under threat globally from pathogens, pesticides and agriculture intensification.\n- Monitoring the behavior of these pollinators can combat population decline.\nThere’s a big buzz coming from the land down under. Researchers from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in Australia are harvesting big data from micro-sensors on thousands of bees in the state of Tasmania. The research program is the first of its kind and is part of the Global Initiative for Honeybee Health, an international collaboration of researchers, beekeepers, farmers, and technology companies.\nBees play a vital role in pollinating food crops. Roughly one third of the food humans consume each day relies on the little creatures, amounting to billions of dollars in the global economy. However, bee populations are facing threats from a number of factors including pathogens, pesticides, and agriculture intensification.\nDown under, biosecurity is a serious issue. Because of Australia’s geographic isolation and subsequent fragile ecosystem, imports are tightly regulated. One of the pests that Australia is trying to keep out is the Varroa mite – a parasite that transmits pathogens which can rapidly lead to the death of bee colonies.\nDue to their size, monitoring how bees spend their time has traditionally been a struggle for scientists. Researchers have tried painting individuals with color codes and monitoring their movements via cameras – a tedious task. But with the new radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags the process is much easier. The micro-sensor ‘backpacks’ – measuring 2.5mm x 2.5mm and weighing about 5 milligrams each – are attached in a matter of seconds and record when the bees pass checkpoints.\nThis data is then shared with scientists worldwide via the cloud to build models revealing how bees interact with the environment. Researchers use this information to analyze the effects of stressors such as disease, pesticides, air pollution, water contamination, diet, and extreme weather on the bee’s ability to pollinate.\n“These RFID tags usually only work within a few mm-range. So, bees need to almost touch the antennas that are installed in places where they will certainly pass, for example, the entry of the hives,” says Paulo de Souza, head of the research group behind the development of the technology. “We managed to increase the range of reading in a few orders of magnitude. This allows us to read the signals more efficiently, reduce the loss in readings and be more flexible with the setup.”\nBees are considered fairly predictable in their behavior hence deviations can indicate stress or environmental changes. Modeling the bees’ movements therefore can help to identify the cause of the change and protect the colony.\nThe CSIRO are now working with Brazil’s Vale Institute of Technology to utilize the sensors in the Amazon so they can compare behavior between the regions.\nFurther work is being done to make even smaller sensors – 1.5mm x 1.5mm – which will interfere less with the bees’ behavior. But the reduced size of the sensors presents a new problem – small battery technology is not powerful enough.\n“The solution we came up with was an energy device that harvests energy from the movements of bees and a battery that is built on a 3D-structure,” says de Souza. “This structure increases the energy density to be stored. A bumble bee can produce as much as 0.5W in one hour of buzz-pollination.”\nThe researchers plan to make small enough sensors to be used on fruit flies and mosquitoes in the future, enabling information to be captured all around the world in unprecedented density.']	['<urn:uuid:b2e07e2b-1f59-42b7-8e8b-3550ab0df9e0>', '<urn:uuid:8fcf56d3-a1b5-4cde-ad60-f9c555f84998>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-02T11:30:12.866257	9	71	1336
653	What security measures should be taken for parking and vehicle safety?	For parking and vehicle safety, you should park in well-lit secured areas, use a locking gas cap, visually check passenger compartments before entering, keep doors locked while driving, and avoid parking lots where keys must be surrendered. Additionally, be alert for vehicles following you and park in busy areas near busy bus stops. Lock your car immediately upon entering or leaving it, and always check the back seat before entering.	['Power Through Partnership…\nTaking Back Control of Your Life\nThis booklet will provide you with some practical guidance, including information to help you deal with a situation you may have previously thought was controlling your life. It will help you realize you are not alone; that there are countless resources available to you, just for the asking. However, the contents are by no means all-inclusive.\nAs a victim of stalking, you certainly realize that it is not only your life that is being impacted, but your family, friends, and/or co-workers as well. Therefore, relevant information contained herein should be shared with all concerned parties.\nYou may or may not have experienced some frustration in the past with the response from the police, or other agencies you have contacted, to help you with your situation. Hopefully, that frustration will shortly be alleviated. Herein lies the “Power Through Partnership” aspect of taking back control of your life. However, for proper management of your case, it is extremely important that you cooperate fully with the police, the detective assigned to your case, and any subsequent judicial proceedings along the way.\nThis booklet is meant to educate you in understanding the dynamics of stalking, as well as providing some common behavioral modifications that will assist in your case management.\nWHAT IS STALKING?\nAccording to California Penal Code Section 646.9, a stalker is “Any person who willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follows or harasses another person and who makes a credible threat with the intent to place that person who is the target of the threat in reasonable fear for his or her safety, or the safety of his or her immediate family and made with the apparent ability to carry out the threat.”\nSimply speaking, stalking involves one person’s obsessive behavior toward another person, causing that victim to fear for his/her safety. The stalker usually begins his stalking behavior with annoying, threatening, or obscene telephone calls or written communications. The stalker may ultimately follow the victim of his obsession, often staking out the victim’s home and/or workplace.\nWHO CAN BECOME THE TARGET OF A STALKER?\nAnyone. Targets, as well as stalkers, traverse all economic, ethnic, and religious boundaries. The stalker’s actions rarely affect only the target. Family, friends, and co-workers are also impacted. A victim can be stalked from several days to many years.\nA few victims are picked at random by their stalker, but most stalking victims know their stalker, usually having had some type of past or present relationship. These are often referred to as Domestic Violence Stalkers. Although we often hear of celebrities who are being stalked, they constitute less than 15% of reported stalking victims, and involves a different type of stalker than most. Domestic Violence Stalkers are far and above the most dangerous and lethal type of stalker.\nWhat Should a Stalked Victim Do?\n- Get a restraining order. Keep a copy with you at all times.\n- Do your best to safely avoid all contact with the stalker.\n- Inform family, friends, and co-workers of what is going on in regard to the stalking.\n- Report the stalking to the police in your area and follow their advice.\n- Keep an accurate journal or log of all incidents connected to the stalking.\n- Keep all letters, packages, taped telephone messages, etc…received from the stalker.\nThe following are some suggestions on how you can enhance your security arrangements:\n- Be alert for any suspicious person.\n- Positively identify callers before opening doors. Install a wide angle viewer in all primary doors.\n- Install a porch light at a height which would discourage removal.\n- Install dead bolts on all outside doors. If you cannot account for all keys, change door locks. Secure spare keys. Place a dowel in sliding glass doors and all sliding windows. Engage these locking devices without fail when leaving the residence for any period of time, as well as when household members are at home.\n- Keep garage doors locked at all times. Use an electric garage door lock.\n- Install adequate outside lighting.\n- Trim shrubbery. Install locks on fence gates.\n- Keep fuse box locked. Have battery lanterns in residence.\n- Install loud exterior alarm bell that can be manually activated in more than one location.\n- Maintain an unlisted telephone number. Alert household members to unusual and wrong number calls. If such activity continues, notify local law enforcement agency.\n- Any written or telephone threat should be treated as legitimate, and must be checked out. Notify the appropriate law enforcement agency.\n- All adult members of the household should be trained in the use of any firearm kept for protection. It should be stored out of the reach of children.\n- Household staff should have a security check prior to employment and should be thoroughly briefed on security precautions. Strictly enforce a policy of the staff not discussing family matters or movement with anyone.Be alert for any unusual packages, boxes or devices found on the premises. Do not disturb such object, instead call the authorities.\n- Maintain all-purpose fire extinguishers in the residence and in the garage. Install a smoke detector system.\n- Tape emergency numbers on all phones.\n- When away from the residence for the evening, place lights and radio/TV on a timer.\n- Prepare an evacuation plan. Brief household members on the plan procedures and test them periodically. Provide ladders or rope for two-story residences.\n- A family dog is one of the least expensive, but most effective, alarm systems.\n- Know the whereabouts of all family members at all times.\n- Children should be accompanied to school or bus stops.\n- Routes taken, and time spent walking should be varied.\n- Require identification of all repairmen and salesmen prior to permitting them entry into the residence.\n- Inform a trusted neighbor regarding the situation. Provide the neighbor with a photo and good description of the suspect and any possible vehicles.\n- Inform trusted neighbors of any anticipated vacations, business trips, etc. and arrange for them to pick up mail, papers, etc.…\n- If residing in a complex with on-site manager, provide the manager with a photo of the suspect. If in secured building, provide information to the doorman or valet.\n- Central reception should handle visitors and packages.\n- Office staff should be alerted of suspicious people, parcels, and packages that do not belong in the area.\n- Establish key and lock control. If keys possessed by terminated employees are not retrieved, change the locks.\n- Park in secured area if available.\n- Have your name removed from any reserved parking area.\n- If there is an on-site security director, make him/her aware of the situation. Provide him/her with suspect photo and information.\n- Have a secretary of co-worker screen calls if necessary.\n- Be aware of anyone possibly following you to/from work.\n- Do not accept any package unless you personally ordered the item.\n- Park vehicles in well-lit areas. Do not patronize parking lots where car doors must be left unlocked and keys surrendered; otherwise surrender only the ignition key. Allow items to be placed in, or removed from the trunk only by your presence.\n- When parked in the residence garage, turn the garage light on and lock the vehicle and garage door.\n- Equip the gas tank with a locking gas cap. The hook-locking device should be controlled from inside the vehicle.\n- Visually check the front and rear passenger compartments before entering the vehicle.\n- Select a reliable service station for vehicle service.\n- Keep doors locked while vehicle is in use.\n- Be alert for vehicles that appear to be following you.\n- When traveling by vehicle, plan ahead. Know the locations of police stations, fire stations, and busy shopping centers.\n- Always park in a secured garage when possible.\n- Remove home address on personal checks and business cards.\n- Utilize a private mailbox service to receive all personal mail.\n- Place real property in a trust, and list utilities under the name of the trust.\n- File for confidential voter status or register to vote utilizing mailbox address.\n- Destroy discarded mail.\n- Telephone lines can be installed in a location other than the person’s residence and call-forwarded to the residence.\n- Place residence rental agreements in another person’s name.\n- The person’s name should not appear on service or delivery orders to the residence.\n- Do not obtain a mailbox with the United States Post Office.\n- Mailbox address now becomes the person’s official address on all records and in all rolodexes. It may be necessary or more convenient to list the mailbox as “Suite 123” or “Apartment 123”, rather than “Box 123.”\n- File a change of address card with the U.S. Post Office giving the mailbox address as the person’s new address.\n- Send postcard to friends, businesses, etc. giving the mailbox address, and requesting that they remove the old address from their files and rolodexes.\n- All current creditors should be given a change of address card to the mailbox address. (Some credit reporting agencies will remove past addresses from credit histories if a report is made. We recommend this be done.)\n- File a change of address with DMV to reflect the person’s new mailbox address. Get a new driver’s license with the new address on it.', 'Safety During an Explosive Incident\n- If an argument seems unavoidable, move to a room with easy access to an exit – NOT a bathroom, kitchen or anywhere near weapons.\n- Identify which door, window, stairwell or elevator offers the quickest way out of your home – and practice your route.\n- Find neighbors you can tell about the violence, and ask that they call the police if they hear a disturbance.\n- Devise a code word to use with your children, family and friends when you need the police.\n- Decide and plan where you will go if you have to leave home, even if you don’t think you will need to.\n- Use your best instincts and judgment. Think of how best to keep safe until help arrives. If the situation is very dangerous, consider giving your abuser what he/she wants to calm him/her down. You have the right to keep yourself safe until you are out of danger.\nSafety When Preparing to Leave\n- Identify a safe place. Determine who will be able to let you stay with them or lend you some money.\n- Have a bag packed and ready. Keep it hidden but easy to get to – for instance, at the house of a trusted friend or relative.\n- Leave money, an extra set of keys, copies of important documents, extra medicines and clothes with someone you trust so you can leave quickly. (See the Checklist of items to take with you.)\n- Get information about protective orders from the House of Ruth, Domestic Violence Legal Clinic, your local police, victim assistance or the court.\n- Call a domestic violence hotline. They can help you with support information and housing.\n- Remember - leaving your batterer is the most dangerous time. Review your safety plan as often as necessary so you know the safest way to leave.\nSafety at Home: After You Have Separated\n- Change the locks and install safety devices on windows.\n- Change your phone number and request to have an unlisted phone number.\n- Develop a safety plan, and discuss it with your children, explain to your children what is going on in an age appropriate way. Review the plan as often as possible.\n- Make sure your children’s school, day-care or camp knows who has permission to pick up your children.\n- Tell your neighbors and landlord that your abuser no longer lives there, and ask them to call the police if they see that person near your home.\n- Before you get back into a potentially abusive relationship, discuss alternatives with someone you trust.\n- Get a Protective Order or Peace Order from the Circuit Court or District Court.\nWays to Make Travel Safe\n- Always park in well-lit area/use busy bus stops.\n- Always lock your car right away (when you leave or enter it).\n- Ask someone to walk you to your car/bus stop.\n- Always check the back seat before you enter your car.\n- Never wait alone at a bus stop.\n- Always carry pepper spray or mace with you.\n- Use different streets to drive home.\n- Look around at every stop light and before you get out of your car.\n- If you see that your abuser is following you or waiting for you, go away and get to a phone and call 911.']	['<urn:uuid:4088d2e7-a0f0-48d1-aa37-f7d6f9cad043>', '<urn:uuid:6012f83c-7c2e-4076-8c23-d283b1caf3cd>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-01T23:21:14.341336	11	70	2123
970	preferred structures habitat fish locations	Murray cod can be found around various types of structure including fallen timber (especially root systems and V-shaped branch formations), small trees and shrubs in fluctuating water levels, large standing timber, rocky shorelines, ledges and drop-offs, river and creek systems within lakes, and weed beds and shoreline vegetation (particularly willow tree roots and cumbungi-lined banks). These structures provide essential habitat and holding areas for Murray cod.	['Catching Murray cod on lures within our lakes can be challenging and rewarding at the same time. There are a huge number of anglers each season who spend large amounts of time targeting Murray cod in many Victorian and New South Wales lakes systems.\nWhether you are fishing Lake Eildon, Lake Hume, Lake Eppalock, Kangaroo Lake or Lake Mulwala all of this locations have their own sets of challenges and with the terrain being very different from one location to another it often takes a considerable amount of skill and knowledge to be able to produce consistent results when targeting Murray cod in different locations.\nLike any other form of fishing it is critical to have a good understanding about the characteristics of the species of fish you are targeting as an angler.\nMurray cod are a species that are very lazy in their nature. Their level of aggression is hugely affected by the barometer. They can be very territorial one day, but not the next. They are ambush feeders and will often ambush prey from a wide variety of structure.\nMurray cod will take a lure out of three main responses. The first is a feeding response. This is when a lure is presented to the Murray cod in such a way that it represent a food source. The Murray cod then comes out and strikes the lures in order to eat it.\nThe second is a territorial response. This is when repetitive casting or trolling of lures past resident Murray cod provokes a strike, often the strike from the Murray cod is intended to chase the intruder away.\nThe third is an instinctive strike. This is when a perfect cast is placed very close to a resident Murray cod and without hesitation instinct kicks in and the Murray cod inhales your lure. The size of this strike zone can vary greatly from day to day. On some of the toughest days fishing that strike zone can be a small as a few centimetres.\nUnfortunately this is a mistake that is commonly made by many anglers. Some very good Murray cod anglers fall into the trap of fishing their favourite locations too often on a regular basis. This is human nature if you have had good success at a particular location, then you go back there thinking you will catch more fish at this same location.\nMurray cod are susceptible to fishing pressure. I believe Murray cod do get educated. I believe that every time a Murray cod is caught and released they learn from that experience and they become harder to fool with an artificial lure in the future.\nMurray cod are no different to people, some fish are smarter than others. Managing to catch a large Murray cod is a great test of your skill and knowledge as an angler. A good location only remains a good location if it receives minimal fishing pressure. My job as a fishing guide relies on my ability to read the water and fish new areas on a regular basis so clients can manage to catch Murray cod. Thus the name of our business is Cod Hunter Fishing Tours. The hunter being the most significant word as this is what we try and teach our clients - the ability to read the water and continue to hunt new areas in search of Murray cod.\nWhen targeting Murray cod in our lakes structure is a very critical ingredient for anglers if they want to catch Murray cod. Timber is a favourite form of structure. This timber can be of several different forms.\nFallen timber or lay me downs as I like to call them provide great habitat for Murray cod and often have several key holding points where Murray cod will take up residence. The most productive holding areas are on the root systems of the fallen timber. Any areas where two branches separate and create a V are excellent holding areas. Also if there are any cross up timber (this is where you have a combination of vertical and horizontal timber meeting) is always worth a look.\nSmall trees or shrubs can be productive structure for targeting Murray cod. This can often be found in lakes that experience large fluctuations in water levels like Lake Eildon. After periods of decreasing water levels followed by good rises in water levels, usually during late spring and early summer, these new forms of structure can provide great habitat and are excellent holding areas for Murray cod.\nLarge standing timber is also very good habitat for Murray cod. However this form of structure is often ignored by many lure fishers to the detriment of their catch rates.\nRock structure can be prevalent in some locations, yet non existent in other lakes. The most common form of rock structures are rocky shorelines. These areas can be productive locations to cast or troll when targeting Murray cod with lures.\nLedges and drop offs are areas that are not often targeted by many anglers when chasing Murray cod. They can be prevalent in some lakes where there are many points or changes in direction around the shoreline.\nRiver and creeks are prevalent within the majority of our lakes systems. These areas can be difficult to locate when they are inside the lake. These river and creeks systems do provide current flows throughout many of our lakes and therefore carry good volumes of food and are favourite holding areas where good concentrations of Murray cod can be located.\nWeed beds and shoreline vegetation are terrific areas to target Murray cod. Many anglers choose not to fish these areas as they can be difficult to fish with weed often fouling lures. Skilled anglers know the inconvenience of regularly clearing lures is worth the effort as some terrific Murray cod are caught off this soft vegetation. Shoreline vegetation can be very productive; this vegetation can be of a wide variety. The root systems of willow trees and cumbungi lined banks are a couple of my favourite types of shoreline vegetation.\nThis is often determined by water temperatures and whether water levels are rising or falling within the lake.\nOften early in summer water levels are still rising and water temperatures are increasing. During this period the best concentrations of bait is in these shallower margins. This is where the greatest concentration of Murray cod will be located. In locations like Lake Mulwala this can be in depths as shallow as 3-6’.\nDuring the middle of summer water temperatures can get very warm and combined with a reduction in water levels the concentration of Murray cod reduces in these shallower margins. In autumn we will often see a short period where good concentration of Murray cod move back into these shallow margins again. Then in late autumn and winter the cooling water temperatures produce a migration of bait from these shallow margins into deep water and the Murray cod follow. There is a common saying amongst anglers: Find the bait, find the fish! This is true for many species.\nThere are a wide variety of lures that are currently on the market for anglers who are targeting Murray cod.\nMy recommendation for anglers is to buy a good selection of different types and styles of lures so their options are covered.\nWhen fishing spinnerbaits for Murray cod I prefer to use small low profile spinnerbaits. Over two decades of fishing this style of lure I continue to produce my best results when fishing single bladed spinnerbaits. Copper blades have been a terrific option for me over the years. Bassman is my preferred brand and Glen Casey is a master of making these lures. His range of colours is very impressive and has an option available for any conditions.\nI also use the Jackall range of lures when targeting Murray cod and a couple of my current favourite options are the Doozer and TN65 models. The Jackall range of lures continues to grow and many of their models such as the Jackall Squirrel and Mascle Deep are very productive, but under used by anglers targeting Murray cod.\nA favourite hard body brand continues to be Custom Crafted lures made by Steve Kovacks. Steve is a master of his trade and he is one of only a few who are still making timber hardbody lures. Models such as the small Hammerhead and Lumo Diver have been consistent over the years. I am looking forward to using some of Steve’s new models which I have had some input into the design and development of these lures for the 2014 season.\nThere are also a growing range of surface lures available for targeting Murray cod.

This project also incorporated video production and online sharing, demonstrating how makerspaces can combine practical creation with critical 21st century literacy skills.	['In 2011, a faculty member wanted to bring in a summer school program for some of our gifted and talented students. Called “Camp Invention”, students spent a week taking apart computers and creating new worlds with peers. I had never seen students more engaged in learning than during this experience.\nAfterward, something nagged at me: the program was not intentional about incorporating reading and writing into the curriculum. I could understand the rationale. Educators are always trying to stuff literacy into anything students are doing. Yet are these two areas – innovation and literacy – mutually exclusive?\nHalverson and Sheridan tease out the complex nature of the maker movement in education (2014). They define it through three lenses: “making as a set of activities, makerspaces as communities of practice, and makers as identities of participation” (501). In literacy, students are (or at least should be) constantly making. For example, consider the verbs we use to describe writing. We craft an essay, develop a narrative, and build an argument. These actions cross the line between the tinkering, creating and iterating that happens in makerspaces and the drafting, revising and publishing that is synonymous with language arts. Halverson and Sheridan also see the possibilities.\n“Learning through making reaches across the divide between formal and informal learning, pushing us to think more expansively about where and how learning happens. In this way we can talk about the who, what, and how of learning without getting hung up on the rules and constraints that govern different settings” (498).\nA question that frequently comes up in education circles is, “How do we get started with makerspaces?” Teachers usually follow this up with concerns about time, resources and administrative support. Now in my second district, and having visited several more, I can say that makerspaces are unique from school to school. Some buildings house makerspaces in their libraries, while others have a separate, dedicated space. When it is not a building initiative, makerspaces find space in teacher’s classrooms under the guise of “Genius Hour”.\nWhat they all have in common is they are personalized to the needs of the students. The kids direct the learning. In response, the adults often adjust their roles to that of a coach and guide on the side. The observed result is higher levels of student engagement in school, which tends to spill over into the core academic areas. Gershenfeld has found increased engagement to be true, noting how personalization is “a market of one person”. In makerspaces, students might start creating something of their own interest, but a lack of purpose and audience might propel them to start thinking about how they can make an impact in the broader world.\nFor instance, 6th grade teacher Chris Craft has led his students in South Carolina to print more than 150 prosthetic human hands for people in need using a 3-D printer (Herold, 2016). This work includes video production and online sharing, all critical literacy skills for the 21st century. This example and others similar show how schools can “decentralize enthusiasm” (Gershenfeld, 57) in the goal of creating engagement in learning through doing real work while applying core competencies. Literacy appears to lend itself way to many of these opportunities.\nGershenfeld, N. (2012). How to make almost anything: The digital fabrication revolution. Foreign Aff., 91, 43.\nHalverson, E. R., & Sheridan, K. (2014). The maker movement in education. Harvard Educational Review, 84(4), 495-504.\nHerold, B. (2016). What It Takes to Move From ‘Passive’ to ‘Active’ Tech Use in K-12 Schools.

422	I've been studying civil rights history and I'm curious about Martin Luther King Jr.'s time in Birmingham jail - what was his response to the white clergymen who criticized him for breaking the law?	In his classic 'Letter from Birmingham Jail' written on April 16, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. responded to eight white clergymen from Alabama who had chastised him for breaking the law. In his response, King argued that it is the duty of people to break unjust laws. He pointed out that everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was 'legal' while everything the freedom fighters did in Hungary was 'illegal.' He famously wrote that 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'	"[""Join the Conversation\nTo find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs\nCivil Rights History: MLK writes 'Birmingham Jail' letter\nApril 16, 1862: Congress abolished slavery in the District of Columbia, with compensation to loyal owners, and appropriated money for the voluntary removal of African Americans to Haiti, Liberia or other countries.\nApril 16, 1963: Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his classic “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” responding to eight white clergymen from Alabama who had chastised him breaking the law. King reminded them that everything that Adolf Hitler did in Germany was “legal” and everything the freedom fighters did in Hungary was “illegal.” “It is the duty of people to break unjust laws,” he wrote. “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”\nApril 17, 1960: The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee was formed in Raleigh, North Carolina, at the Shaw University Conference organized by Ella Baker. SNCC helped coordinate sit-ins and other direct action. SNCC workers who played important roles in the civil rights movement included Diane Nash, future U.S. Rep. John Lewis, longtime NAACP leader Julian Bond and Stokely Carmichael, who left SNCC to become a leader for the Black Panthers. At the conference, Guy Carawan sang a new version of “We Shall Overcome,” which became the national anthem of the civil rights movement. Workers joined hands and gently swayed in time, singing “black and white together,” repeating, “Deep in my heart, I do believe, we shall overcome some day.”\nApril 18, 1688: Four Quakers in Germantown, Pennsylvania, drafted the Germantown Quaker Petition Against Slavery — the first American document to protest slavery. The document marked one of the first such written declarations of such human rights, saying liberty should be extended to all people, regardless of color, and that other people should be treated the same way we wish to be treated.\nApril 18, 1941: Bus companies in New York City agreed to hire 200 African-American workers after a four-week boycott by riders led by Adam Clayton Powell Jr., a pastor for Harlem’s Abysinnian Baptist Church, the largest Protestant congregation in the U.S. He became the first African American elected to Congress from New York and was reelected 10 more times. During his service through 1971, he supported legislation that helped attack poverty, desegregate public schools and expand higher education opportunities for all Americans.\nApril 18, 1959: About 26,000 students took part in the Youth March for Integrated Schools in Washington, D.C. They heard speeches by Martin Luther King Jr., A. Phillip Randolph and NAACP leader Roy Wilkins. “In your great movement to organize a march for integrated schools,” King told them, “you have awakened on hundreds of campuses throughout the land a new spirit of social inquiry to the benefit of all Americans.”\nApril 19, 1977: Alex Haley was awarded a special Pulitzer Prize for Roots. His book was later transformed into an epic television mini-series seen by 130 million Americans.

Grant signed the Ku Klux Klan Act, otherwise known as the Civil Rights Act of 1871. The act gave the president the authority to suppress terrorist organizations by force and to impose harsh penalties on them. The act also gave victims the choice of going to federal courts instead of Klan-influenced local courts. In 1882, the U.S. Supreme Court declared this act unconstitutional.\nApril 20, 1939: Jazz singer Billie Holiday stepped into a 5th Avenue studio and recorded “Strange Fruit,” a song written by a high school teacher upset about the lynchings of African Americans. Weeks earlier, she had sung it for the first time at the Café Society in New York City. When she finished, “there wasn’t even a patter of applause,” she wrote in her memoir. “Then a lone person began to clap nervously. Then suddenly everybody was clapping.” The song sold more than a million copies, and jazz writer Leonard Feather called it “the first significant protest in words and music, the first unmuted cry against racism.” After her 1959 death, both she and the song went into the Grammy Hall of Fame, Time magazine called “Strange Fruit” the song of the century, and the British music publication Q included it among “10 songs that actually changed the world.”\nApril 21, 1865: Abraham Lincoln’s funeral train left Washington, D.C., heading for Illinois. Mourners collected near the track and the train headed on its 1,700-mile trip. In Philadelphia, the line of mourners stretched three miles long. Thousands of African Americans traveled for days to attend the funeral, where Bishop Matthew Simpson spoke of the slain president: “Mute though thy lips be, yet they still speak. Hushed is thy voice, but its echoes of liberty are ringing through the world, and the sons of bondage listen with joy. … We crown thee as our martyr — and humanity enthrones thee as her triumphant son. Hero, Martyr, Friend, Farewell.”\nApril 21, 1966: Milton Olive III became the first African American to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in the Vietnam War. Olive and fellow members of the 3d Platoon of Company B had been making their way through the jungles to locate Viet Cong operating in the area. As the soldiers pursued the enemy, a grenade was thrown into the middle of them. Olive grabbed the grenade and fell on it, absorbing the blast with his body. His actions saved the lives of his platoon members. Olive’s parents received the medal on his behalf.\nApril 22, 1892: Fiery civil rights pioneer Vernon Johns was born in Darlington Heights, Virginia, which is in Prince Edward County. He taught himself German and other languages so well that when the dean of Oberlin College handed him a book of German scripture, Johns easily passed, won admission and became the top student at Oberlin College. In 1948, the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, hired Johns, who mesmerized the crowd with his photographic memory of scripture. But he butted heads with the middle-class congregation when he chastised members for disliking muddy manual labor, selling cabbages, hams and watermelons on the streets near the state capitol. He pressed civil rights issues, helping black rape victims bring their cases to authorities, ordering a meal from a white restaurant and refusing to sit in the back of a bus. No one in the congregation followed his lead, and turmoil continued to rise between the pastor and his parishioners. In May 1953, he resigned, returning to his family farm. His successor? A young preacher named Martin Luther King Jr. James Earl Jones portrayed the eccentric pastor in the 1994 TV film, “Road to Freedom: The Vernon Johns Story,” and historian Taylor Branch profiled Johns in his Pulitzer-winning “Parting the Waters; America in the King Years 1954-63.”\nApril 22, 1922: Legendary jazz bassist Charles Mingus was born in Nogales, Arizona. Fourteen years after his 1979 death, the Library of Congress acquired his scores and papers in what they called “the most important acquisition of a manuscript collection relating to jazz in the library’s history.” In 1997, he posthumously received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\nApril 22, 1957: All the baseball teams in the National League integrated.

402	nose blockage and yellow mucus not going away with cold medicine what could this mean	These symptoms suggest you may have sinusitis. When you experience a prolonged cold with a stuffy nose and yellow or green mucus coming from the nose, this indicates a sinus condition. This occurs when the sinuses become inflamed and mucus gets stuck, creating a breeding ground for bacteria. The condition may require specific treatment - antibiotics are typically used for acute sinusitis and are usually given for about two weeks, though more aggressive cases may require longer courses. Decongestants and humidifiers can also help manage symptoms.	['Almost all sinus problems begin inside the nose. The sinuses (described below) connect with the internal lining of the nose via small tubes. These tubes must stay clear otherwise sinus obstruction occurs, leading to various unpleasant and stubborn medical conditions. Patients of whatever age with long standing nose and sinus problems worsen during the change of seasons March/April and September/October.\nSinuses are cave-like pockets in the skull and are lined with much the same material as our respiratory tracts. The function of sinuses is uncertain but theories include humidifying air, providing cushioning for the skull and increasing resonance of the voice. Cynics claim:\nSinuses only exist to make ENT surgeons and allergists rich!\nSinuses can become inflamed as a result of infection or an allergic challenge.\nTiny hairs along the respiratory tract push mucus up towards our nose and mouth. When the lining of the sinuses swells this mucus becomes stuck and causes uncomfortable pressure. It also produces a perfect breeding ground for bacteria.\nThere are four types of sinuses found on the face called the maxillary, frontal, sphenoid and ethmoid. When each (or all) is inflamed from infection or allergic challenge different symptoms are experienced.\nWhat might I experience when my sinuses become inflamed or infected?\nThe green colour marks the maxillary sinuses, located just behind the cheekbones on the face.\nIf you have an inflammation of the maxillary sinuses you may experience:\n- Cheek pain/pressure\nThe red colour identifies the frontal sinuses, located just above the bone at the centre of each\neyebrow. If you have an inflammation of the frontal sinuses you may experience:\n- Pain around and behind the eyes\nThe orange colour identifies the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses. The ethmoids are located between the eyes and just behind the bridge of the nose. Behind the ethmoid sinuses, tucked in behind the eyes are the sphenoid sinuses. If you have an inflammation of either or both you may experience:\n- Pain/pressure between and behind the eyes\n17 year old male with long history of nasal obstruction, headaches and runny nose. Photo shows grossly swollen nasal lining obstructing the sinus openings. X-ray showed that the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses were thickened from long term obstruction.\nOther symptoms associated with Sinusitis:\n- Prolonged cold with a stuffy nose\n- Green, yellow or blood streaked mucus coming from the nose\n- Pain in the head that worsens when lying back-down or bending over\nThe condition of Rhinitis (ailment of the nose) is associated with Sinusitis as the inflammation of the nose (streaming and persistent sneezing amongst other symptoms) can progress into the adjoining sinuses.\nIn the digital image there is severe swelling of all the lining in the nasal cavity causing symptoms such as blockage, mouth breathing, diminished sense of smell and taste and ‘wheeziness’. Treatment involves first restoring the nasal lining to normal, then stabilising the area and deciding what the cause is. In this case it was an aggressive allergy to dust mites and grass pollens. This patient would benefit greatly from a new treatment called Rhinolight U/V phototherapy combined with immunotherapy (full details elsewhere in this website).\nFungal Sinusitis was once considered a rarity but may be more common than previously realised. Symptoms are often similar to those of bacterial sinusitis and the fungal infection may trigger fleshy (benign) growths inside the nose called polyps. People who are allergic to fungi are often more susceptible to this particular form of sinusitis. A CT scan commonly determines whether or not a fungal infection has occurred and standard procedures such as endoscopic surgery are considered to clear the offended fungus and resume normal sinus drainage.\nNose polyps. These are benign fleshy, grape-like growths that form inside the nose and sinuses. There is no agreement on the causes of nose polyps but some US researchers believe that an allergic response to fungal spores may be one explanation.\nAntibiotic medications are used to treat acute sinusitis. These medications are usually given for about two weeks, but aggressive sinusitis may require longer courses. Decongestants, or the short-term use of decongestant nose sprays, can be useful. Analgesics decrease the associated pain and headache. Also, running a humidifier can prevent mucus within the nasal passages from drying out uncomfortably, and can help soothe any accompanying sore throat or cough.\nChronic sinusitis is often treated initially with antibiotics. Steroid nasal drops and sprays may be used to decrease swelling in the nasal passages. If an anatomic reason is found for chronic sinusitis, it may need to be corrected with surgery. If a surgical procedure is necessary, samples are usually taken at the same time to identify any organisms present which may be causing infection.\nFungal sinusitis will require surgery to clean out the sinuses. Then, a relatively long course of a strong antifungal medication may be offered.\nAllergic nose and sinus issues my now be treated using the latest non-medical technique Rhinolight.\nWe take your sinus issues seriously. When you attend you will be quizzed about symptoms such as:\n- Mouth breathing\n- Dry mouth every morning after sleep (suggesting night time mouth breathing)\n- Runny nose\n- Post nasal drip\n- Blood stained mucus\n- Diminished (or lost) senses of smell and taste\n- Associated asthma or shortness of breath or night cough\n- Associated skin hives (medical term is urticaria)\n- Aspirin or dispirin or similar pain killer allergy\nThis information gives us valuable insights as to what type of sinus problem you have. We then inspect the nose and sinuses with an Olympus ENF fiberscope (see photo below). This is a 3mm in diameter fiberoptic instrument that allows us visually check the breathing tract from the tip of the nose to the vocal cords. Our fiberscope is connected to an LCD screen that allows the patient follow the procedure. The screen can display an image ‘freeze’ so we can discuss an area of particular importance.\nOlympus fiberscope in action. The flexible tip measures 3 mms and passes easily along the nose, into the back of the throat and down to the vocal cords. On the screen all areas can be viewed. Specific zones of interest can be photographed and recorded to assess treatment strategies. This has been used on children as young as 5 years and adults over 80 years.\nWe combine this with a full allergy screen.\nFull allergy test and fiberoptic assessment of the nose, sinuses and throat: €290. Follow up fee where necessary is €80.\nBelow are examples of images we captured on patients illustrating just how troublesome their sinus problems were at the first consultation.\n25 year old with the internal surface of the nose so allergically challenged fluid is beginning to swell the lining. Left untreated the shiny bubble-like area at 8 o’clock will become a polyp. In long standing nose and sinus allergic challenge, if an infection sets in ON TOP of the background changes considerable extra damage can be inflicted on the soft tissue.\nA nasal polyp. This is a benign but nuisance growth inside the nose that causes symptoms of obstruction, loss of senses of smell and taste and may trigger asthma.\nEven in children as young as 5 years considerable swelling can occur within the nasal cavity. This in turn obstructs the sinus openings causing sinus problems. And in turn this may trigger off asthma. If the nose and sinus problems are corrected the asthma usually abates significantly.']	['<urn:uuid:03d12e4c-b45c-4f22-ac6e-15bd9bb32282>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-01T22:47:46.423955	15	86	1236

The bear markets following the Nifty Fifty crash in the mid-70s and Black Monday of 1987 had average losses of about 40 percent and lasted 240 days, while the dot-com and credit crises lost on average about 52 percent and lasted over 430 days.

It is therefore with something close to despair that we ask: What is it about risk taking that so eludes our understanding, and our control?\nPart of the problem is that we tend to view financial risk taking as a purely intellectual activity. But this view is incomplete. Risk is more than an intellectual puzzle — it is a profoundly physical experience, and it involves your body. Risk by its very nature threatens to hurt you, so when confronted by it your body and brain, under the influence of the stress response, unite as a single functioning unit. This occurs in athletes and soldiers, and it occurs as well in traders and people investing from home. The state of your body predicts your appetite for financial risk just as it predicts an athlete’s performance.\nIf we understand how a person’s body influences risk taking, we can learn how to better manage risk takers. We can also recognize that mistakes governments have made have contributed to excessive risk taking.\nConsider the most important risk manager of them all — the Federal Reserve. Over the past 20 years, the Fed has pioneered a new technique of influencing Wall Street. Where before the Fed shrouded its activities in secrecy, it now informs the street in as clear terms as possible of what it intends to do with short-term interest rates, and when. Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Fed, declared this new transparency, called forward guidance, a revolution; Ben S. Bernanke, her predecessor, claimed it reduced uncertainty and calmed the markets. But does it really calm the markets? Or has eliminating uncertainty in policy spread complacency among the financial community and actually helped inflate market bubbles?\nWe get a fascinating answer to these questions if we turn from economics and look into the biology of risk taking.\nONE biological mechanism, the stress response, exerts an especially powerful influence on risk taking. We live with stress daily, especially at work, yet few people truly understand what it is. Most of us tend to believe that stress is largely a psychological phenomenon, a state of being upset because something nasty has happened. But if you want to understand stress you must disabuse yourself of that view. The stress response is largely physical: It is your body priming itself for impending movement.\nAs such, most stress is not, well, stressful. For example, when you walk to the coffee room at work, your muscles need fuel, so the stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol recruit glucose from your liver and muscles; you need oxygen to burn this fuel, so your breathing increases ever so slightly; and you need to deliver this fuel and oxygen to cells throughout your body, so your heart gently speeds up and blood pressure increases. This suite of physical reactions forms the core of the stress response, and, as you can see, there is nothing nasty about it at all.\nFar from it. Many forms of stress, like playing sports, trading the markets, even watching an action movie, are highly enjoyable. In moderate amounts, we get a rush from stress, we thrive on risk taking. In fact, the stress response is such a healthy part of our lives that we should stop calling it stress at all and call it, say, the challenge response.\nThis mechanism hums along, anticipating challenges, keeping us alive, and it usually does so without breaking the surface of consciousness. We take in information nonstop and our brain silently, behind the scenes, figures out what movement might be needed and then prepares our body. Many neuroscientists now believe our brain is designed primarily to plan and execute movement, that every piece of information we take in, every thought we think, comes coupled with some pattern of physical arousal. We do not process information as a computer does, dispassionately; we react to it physically. For humans, there is no pure thought of the kind glorified by Plato, Descartes and classical economics.\nOur challenge response, and especially its main hormone cortisol (produced by the adrenal glands) is particularly active when we are exposed to novelty and uncertainty. If a person is subjected to something mildly unpleasant, like bursts of white noise, but these are delivered at regular intervals, they may leave cortisol levels unaffected. But if the timing of the noise changes and it is delivered randomly, meaning it cannot be predicted, then cortisol levels rise significantly.\nUncertainty over the timing of something unpleasant often causes a greater challenge response than the unpleasant thing itself. Sometimes it is more stressful not knowing when or if you are going to be fired than actually being fired. Why? Because the challenge response, like any good defense mechanism, anticipates; it is a metabolic preparation for the unknown.\nYou may now have an inkling of just how central this biology is to the financial world. Traders are immersed in novelty and uncertainty the moment they step onto a trading floor. Here they encounter an information-rich environment like none other. Every event in the world, every piece of news, flows nonstop onto the floor, showing up on news feeds and market prices, blinking and disappearing. News by its very nature is novel, adds volatility to the market and puts us into a state of vigilance and arousal.\nI observed this remarkable call and echo between news and body when, after running a trading desk on Wall Street for 13 years, I returned to the University of Cambridge and began researching the neuroscience of trading.\nIn one of my studies, conducted with 17 traders on a trading floor in London, we found that their cortisol levels rose 68 percent over an eight-day period as volatility increased. Subsequent, as yet unpublished, studies suggest to us that this cortisol response to volatility is common in the financial community. A question then arose: Does this cortisol response affect a person’s risk taking? In a follow-up study, my colleagues from the department of medicine pharmacologically raised the cortisol levels of a group of 36 volunteers by a similar 69 percent over eight days. We gauged their risk appetite by means of a computerized gambling task. The results, published recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that the volunteers’ appetite for risk fell 44 percent.\nMost models in economics and finance assume that risk preferences are a stable trait, much like your height. But this assumption, as our studies suggest, is misleading. Humans are designed with shifting risk preferences. They are an integral part of our response to stress, or challenge.\nWhen opportunities abound, a potent cocktail of dopamine — a neurotransmitter operating along the pleasure pathways of the brain — and testosterone encourages us to expand our risk taking, a physical transformation I refer to as “the hour between dog and wolf.” One such opportunity is a brief spike in market volatility, for this presents a chance to make money. But if volatility rises for a long period, the prolonged uncertainty leads us to subconsciously conclude that we no longer understand what is happening and then cortisol scales back our risk taking. In this way our risk taking calibrates to the amount of uncertainty and threat in the environment.\nUnder conditions of extreme volatility, such as a crisis, traders, investors and indeed whole companies can freeze up in risk aversion, and this helps push a bear market into a crash. Unfortunately, this risk aversion occurs at just the wrong time, for these crises are precisely when markets offer the most attractive opportunities, and when the economy most needs people to take risks. The real challenge for Wall Street, I now believe, is not so much fear and greed as it is these silent and large shifts in risk appetite.\nI consult regularly with risk managers who must grapple with unstable risk taking throughout their organizations. Most of them are not aware that the source of the problem lurks deep in our bodies. Their attempts to manage risk are therefore comparable to firefighters’ spraying water at the tips of flames.\nTHE Fed, however, through its control of policy uncertainty, has in its hands a powerful tool for influencing risk takers. But by trying to be more transparent, it has relinquished this control.\nForward guidance was introduced in the early 2000s. But the process of making monetary policy more transparent was in fact begun by Alan Greenspan back in the early 1990s. Before that time the Fed, especially under Paul A. Volcker, operated in secrecy. Fed chairmen did not announce rate changes, and they felt no need to explain themselves, leaving Wall Street highly uncertain about what was coming next. Furthermore, changes in interest rates were highly volatile: When Mr. Volcker raised rates, he might first raise them, cut them a few weeks later, and then raise again, so the tightening proceeded in a zigzag. Traders were put on edge, vigilant, never complacent about their positions so long as Mr. Volcker lurked in the shadows. Street wisdom has it that you don’t fight the Fed, and no one tangled with that bruiser.\nUnder Mr. Greenspan, the Fed became less intimidating and more transparent. Beginning in 1994 the Fed committed to changing fed funds only at its scheduled meetings (except in emergencies); it announced these changes at fixed times; and it communicated its easing or tightening bias. Mr. Greenspan notoriously spoke in riddles, but his actions had no such ambiguity. Mr. Bernanke reduced uncertainty even further: Forward guidance detailed the Fed’s plans.\nUnder both chairmen fed funds became far less erratic. Whereas Mr. Volcker changed rates in a volatile fashion, up one week down the next, Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke raised them in regular steps. Between 2004 and 2006, rates rose .25 percent at every Fed meeting, without fail... tick, tick, tick. As a result of this more gradualist Fed, volatility in fed funds fell after 1994 by as much as 60 percent.\nIn a speech to the Cato Institute in 2007, Mr. Bernanke claimed that minimizing uncertainty in policy ensured that asset prices would respond “in ways that further the central bank’s policy objectives.” But evidence suggests that quite the opposite has occurred.\nCycles of bubble and crash have always existed, but in the 20 years after 1994, they became more severe and longer lasting than in the previous 20 years. For example, the bear markets following the Nifty Fifty crash in the mid-70s and Black Monday of 1987 had an average loss of about 40 percent and lasted 240 days; while the dot-com and credit crises lost on average about 52 percent and lasted over 430 days. Moreover, if you rank the largest one-day percentage moves in the market over this 40-year period, 76 percent of the largest gains and losses occurred after 1994.\nI suspect the trends in fed funds and stocks were related. As uncertainty in fed funds declined, one of the most powerful brakes on excessive risk taking in stocks was released.\nDuring their tenures, in response to surging stock and housing markets, both Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke embarked on campaigns of tightening, but the metronome-like ticking of their rate increases was so soothing it failed to dampen exuberance.\nThere are times when the Fed does need to calm the markets. After the credit crisis, it did just that. But when the economy and market are strong, as they were during the dot-com and housing bubbles, what, pray tell, is the point of calming the markets? Of raising rates in a predictable fashion? If you think the markets are complacent, then unnerve them. Over the past 20 years the Fed may have perfected the art of reassuring the markets, but it has lost the power to scare. And that means stock markets more easily overshoot, and then collapse.\nThe Fed could dampen this cycle. It has, in interest rate policy, not one tool but two: the level of rates and the uncertainty of rates. Given the sensitivity of risk preferences to uncertainty, the Fed could use policy uncertainty and a higher volatility of funds to selectively target risk taking in the financial community. People running factories or coffee shops or drilling wells might not even notice. And that means the Fed could keep the level of rates lower than otherwise to stimulate the economy.\nIT may seem counterintuitive to use uncertainty to quell volatility. But a small amount of uncertainty surrounding short-term interest rates may act much like a vaccine immunizing the stock market against bubbles. More generally, if we view humans as embodied brains instead of disembodied minds, we can see that the risk-taking pathologies found in traders also lead chief executives, trial lawyers, oil executives and others to swing from excessive and ill-conceived risks to petrified risk aversion. It will also teach us to manage these risk takers, much as sport physiologists manage athletes, to stabilize their risk taking and to lower stress.\nAnd that possibility opens up exciting vistas of human performance.']	['<urn:uuid:5fd8b5fa-5b7e-454a-8861-2c54acc16970>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-01T22:36:12.692263	22	54	2191
1212	What different observations require a thorough sputum specimen collection?	Sputum specimens are collected for three main purposes: 1) culture and sensitivity testing of microorganisms, 2) cytology to examine the origin, structure, function and pathology of cells including cancer detection, and 3) acid-fast bacillus (AFB) testing to identify TB and assess the effectiveness of TB treatment. The proper amount for collection should be 1-2 tablespoons or 15-30 mL.

688	How do both community gardening projects and flexible work arrangements contribute to better mental health and community wellbeing?	Both initiatives significantly improve mental health and community connections. Living in greener neighborhoods has been shown to improve mental health and increase life spans, with patterns indicating lower crime rates in greener areas. Guerrilla gardening helps create a sense of belonging and ownership in neighborhoods, particularly beneficial for young urbanites who often feel disconnected from their communities. It brings people together and lifts spirits by adding life to otherwise grey areas. Similarly, the 4-day workweek has demonstrated remarkable benefits for mental wellbeing, with studies showing that 78% of staff report being happier and 70% experiencing reduced stress levels. Employees with 4-day workweeks also took fewer sick days, and 25% of employees stated they would use their extra day off to volunteer in their communities, further strengthening community bonds.	"[""Meet the guerrilla gardeners of Europe. Their form of climate activism transforms neighbourhoods and brings local communities together.\nClimate activism has become increasingly synonymous with rebellion. International groups like Zero Hour and Extinction Rebellion summon huge crowds of protestors and find headline-baiting ways to express their anger.\nBut what if there was a way to advocate for the environment in your local neighbourhood through small, everyday actions?\nGuerrilla gardening is the act of cultivating plants in a public place, usually in a spot that is not otherwise being cared for, often with the aim of improving the surroundings and protecting the environment. It has a range of benefits from improving biodiversity to helping to keep temperatures low.\nJenny van Gestel, coordinator of Guerrilla Gardeners NL, explains how transforming one street can have a far-reaching impact on the environment.\nIs guerrilla gardening illegal?\nMany people assume that guerrilla gardening is illegal - and sometimes it is. For Ellen Miles, climate activist and founder of social enterprise Dream Green, guerrilla gardening is definitely an anarchic form of protest.\n“It’s direct action against nature deprivation and depletion - highlighting the issue of biophobic urbanisation while fighting it,” explains Ellen.\n“It’s fighting for people, plants, and the planet by taking action into your own hands. It’s anarchic, in the purest sense, and is challenging the status quo of what we’ve been taught cities should look like, and who can have the power and right to shape them.”\nBut it doesn’t have to be illicit activity. Part of Jenny’s work with Guerrilla Gardeners NL is to reassure people that there are ways to take part in this form of activism legally, even with the blessing of local authorities.\nShe regularly works with the municipal government where she lives in the Netherlands, identifying greening projects together with local civil servants. She also tries to encourage locals to get involved in areas near them.\n“One of the things I've been doing here is trying to get people that have [tree pits] in front of their house or near their house to garden in them,” Jenny says. “There's so much you can do just by cooperating with the authorities.”\n“You do not need an organisation. Just as an individual, there's so much you can do...Start small. You don't have to start with a huge garden, just start by removing one paving stone, add one plant, and then just see how it goes. See how the neighbours respond, see how the plant starts growing, and maybe you can develop it from there.”\nGetting started with guerrilla gardening\nJenny believes that anyone can get started with guerrilla gardening - even if there’s no organised group near you. If you spot a neglected area of public space that no one else is using, it’s a prime opportunity to get involved.\nIf you’re nervous about whether it’s allowed, you can reach out to your local government, but both Jenny and Ellen say they rarely run into obstacles when planting on otherwise unused spots.\n“Part of the guerrilla gardening concept is asking for 'forgiveness not permission' but I’ve only ever received positive responses from people, so no forgiveness needed,” explains Ellen.\n“It’s mainly about where you plant. First, you want to avoid planting on anyone’s private property or a protected spot (like a National Trust site or nature reservation).”\nEllen explains that tree pits are a great way to start. Although they don’t advertise it, many councils will allow you to plant here as long as you don’t damage the tree.\n“I’ve never had any trouble just using common sense to see what’s a neglected, bare spot of soil that was meant to have plants in but now doesn’t. If the council aren’t going to look after it, why shouldn’t a resident name themselves its gardening angel?”\nRemember that dogs, people and various hazards might bother your patch. So when you pick what to plant it needs to be hardy, resilient and able to cope with the climate without too much assistance from you. Otherwise, you’ll have to keep coming back to tend to the plants, meaning less time to spend on new areas.\n“When choosing plants, we also take into account what would [attract] wild bees, what would attract butterflies, and so on,” explains Jenny. “That's another aspect and they're often indigenous species.”\nWhy is greening important?\nAside from the environmental benefits, now more than ever, caring for our local areas is beneficial for ourselves and our communities.\n“It's interesting to note that the movement is growing again,” says Jenny. “Because of the previous year that we've had and people [being] stuck inside...there's a renewed interest in our own neighbourhoods.”\nEllen also sees the connection between guerrilla gardening and community. She notes that living in greener neighbourhoods improves mental health, life spans increase and that there are patterns indicating that crime is less common in greener areas.\n“I find it empowering to positively impact my local environment and have a sense of ownership of the place I live,” explains Ellen. “There’s a real issue of young urbanites not feeling they ‘belong’ in their neighbourhood, and it’s clear why - cities just aren’t designed for people.\n“Guerrilla gardening puts the power to transform the streets that people live in in the hands of the people who live there. It lifts the spirits seeing bright patches of life in otherwise bare, grey spots and I love knowing that I’m helping the local ecosystems and community.”"", ""The 4-day workweek is likely one of the most successful work schedules that I have implemented in my career in terms of employee engagement, employee development, team readiness, and employee delight. Put simply, employees love 3-day weekends, and these can be created by a 4-10 work schedule. Let me explain.\nYears ago I ran a 24x7 operation with a central station and monitored services worldwide. We experimented with many different shift types and schedules. The worst of all schedules was the 3x12s, where a worker spends three days at work in 12-hour shifts, and barely has time to get home and get rested before they return to work; they were tired, angry, sleepy, error-prone, and not fit for work after a series of these challenging 3x12s. However, the 4x10s were almost magical. To cover our 7-day schedule, we overlapped two 4x10s, where every employee worked one weekend day. Employees could choose to work from Sunday through Wednesday, or Wednesday through Saturday. We used Wednesdays as team training days, employee development days, and planning days. Our team was so trained up, so communicative based on being together on Wednesdays, that it ignited the creativity, collaboration, and goodwill of our team members. They were also highly grateful for the addition of the regular 3-day weekends to their schedule. I don’t think I’ve had a happier group of employees than those who were on the 4x10 schedule. Importantly, this saved us money (in terms of office space) and gave us great flex capacity to expand work with multiple shifts of well-rested and highly trained employees. That was my experience and I highly recommend it for consideration to others. Now, what does independent research say about the 4x10 work week?\nSome businesses in the UK are currently experimenting with operating on a 4-day workweek. Spurred on by The 4 Day Week Campaign, businesses such as the Earth Science Partnership, Social Enterprise Direct, and The UPAC Group (Scotland's largest independent packaging supplier), have all implemented 4-day workweek standards (The4DayWeek, n.d.). Are these businesses venturing into the unknown, or is there data that supports a shortened workweek? What are the benefits and drawbacks of the 4-day workweek? What should managers and business leaders consider when implementing or leading shortened workweeks? Continue to find out.\n“To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.” - Winston Churchill\nDefining a 4-day workweek\nIn order to examine the effects of a 4-day workweek, we must first have a clear definition of a 4-day workweek. The 4 Day Week Campaign defines a 4-day workweek as “a 32-hour working week (or less) worked over 4 days with no reduction in pay.” For The 4 Day Week Campaign, a 4-day workweek is not 4 days of 10-hour shifts. However, not all organizations look at the 4-day workweek the same way. For example, companies in Japan are encouraged to allow their employees to work 4, 10-hour days (Harter &Pendell, 2021). This is an important difference to consider when examining the available data and considering the implementation of a 4-day workweek.\nBelow we review some of the key data points and statistics regarding a 4-day workweek.\nHenley Business School UK 2019\n⅔ of businesses with a 4-day workweek “reported improvements in staff productivity”\n⅓ of business leaders believe that switching to a 4-day workweek will be “important for success in the future”\n¾ of surveyed Brits support a 4-day workweek\n67% of Gen Z Brits claim that when job searching, the proposition of a 4-day workweek, would “help them pick a place to work”\n4-day workweeks “could save UK businesses an estimated £104 billion annually”\nIncreased productivity via increased staff mental and physical health\nA 4-day workweek can reduce environmental output\n78% of staff state that they are happier with a 4-day workweek\n70% of staff experienced reduced levels of stress\n62% of staff took fewer days off due to illness\n63% of employers said that having a 4-day workweek “has helped them to attract and retain talent”\n25% of employees stated that they would use their extra day off to volunteer\n40% of employees would use the extra time off to “up-skill or develop professional skills”\n72% of survey participants said that a 4-day workweek would be a “firm driver” when job searching\nThe 4-day workweek does not increase employee engagement\nThe 4-day workweek is associated with an increase in “thriving wellbeing”\n“The percentage of actively disengaged workers was highest for those with 4-day and 6-day work weeks”\nQuality of workplace experience has “2.5 to 3 times the impact” on “overall wellbeing” than the “number of days or hours worked” (Harter & Pendell, 2021).\nNote: these statistics are based on organizations that work at least 35 hours per week during a 4-day workweek\nSociety of Human Resource Management\n45% of survey respondents said that they “were interested in working an alternative work schedule”\n80% of employees claim that “they would be more loyal to their employers if they had flexible work options”\n23% of organizations run on a “true 4-day workweek”\n60% of organizations that operate on a 4-day workweek express “gains in employee satisfaction and productivity resulting from fewer meetings”\n39% of U.S. workers have a “distaste for the 4-day workweek”\nCommon reasons for disliking the 4-day workweek include the “inability to maintain social aspects of work, limited productivity, and fear of distractions from their work”\n“Time management is a misnomer, the challenge is to manage ourselves.” - Stephen R. Covey\nBenefits of the 4-day workweek\nFewer workplace distractions\nIn an article by AdeccoGroup, “Andrew Barnes, the owner of New Zealand law firm Perpetual Guardian” reported that employees were less distracted from work after implementing a 4-day workweek program. Employees spent “35% less time on non-work websites” and they believe it is because they had more time to manage their “household life and responsibilities outside of work” (AdeccoGroup, 2021). Other organizations such as TimeCamp state that when employees are more relaxed and less stressed due to the extended 3-day weekend, they are less likely to be distracted (Rybacka, 2021). This assumption is backed by The Anxiety Center’s president Jim Folk who states that “being easily distracted is a common indication of persistently elevated stress” (Folk, 2021). By giving employees more time to fulfill their household responsibilities, rest, de-stress, and invest in their relationships with friends and family, 4-day workweek businesses are helping their employees focus on work when at work and home when at home.\nClosely related to the increased focus of 4-day workweek employees, 4-day workweeks have also been associated with an increase in productivity. After examining over 250 global workplaces that have implemented a shortened workweek, the Henley Business School states that “two-thirds of UK businesses operating on a four-day week reported improvements in staff productivity” and that this was due to the increased mental health and wellbeing of staff (HenleyBusinessSchool, 2019). Furthermore, the Society of Human Resource Management reports that 60% of organizations that operate on a 4-day workweek increased their “productivity” due to the reduced amount of “meetings” (Agovino, 2020). According to Deutsche Welle, in 2019, Microsoft Japan experimented with giving all employees Fridays off, resulting in a 40% increase in productivity (Imran, 2021).\nIncreased attraction of new employees\nThe 4-day workweek is especially attractive to employees. According to Henley Business School, 67% of Gen Z Brits claim that when job searching, the proposition of a 4-day workweek would be a driving force that helped them pick where they wanted to work. They also report that 75% of Brits, in general, are in support of a shortened workweek (HenleyBusinessSchool, 2019). A survey done by the Society of Human Resource Management reported that 45% of people are interested in an “alternative work schedule” (Agovino, 2020). Since the COVID-19 pandemic, employees have become increasingly concerned with their quality of life and work/life balance. According to PWC’s workforce pulse survey findings, “employees deeply value extra paid time off, including dedicated time to upskill or volunteer, as so important they’d give up part of their future earnings to get it.” Employees are searching for careers with increased “flexibility” and “personalization” (pwc, 2021). By offering a 4-day workweek, employers can increase the flexibility they offer their employees, ultimately attracting more employees.\n“It’s about getting the best people, retaining them, nurturing a creative environment & helping to find a way to innovate.” - Marissa Mayer\nIncreased retainment of employees\nNot only does a 4-day workweek increase the attractiveness of an organization to potential employees, but it also helps them retain the employees they already have. According to surveys done by the Henley Business School, 63% of employers reported that having a 4-day workweek “has helped them to attract and retain talent” (2019). TimeCamp also states that 4-day workweeks can prevent employee burnout (Rybacka, 2021). The Society of Human Resource Management also states that “80% of employees claim that they would be more loyal to their employers if they had flexible work options” (Agovino, 2020).\nIncreased employee wellness\nThere are a myriad of benefits to employee wellness that a 4-day workweek offers. Surveys by the Henley School of Business reported that for 4-day workweek businesses, 78% of staff are happier, 70% of staff experienced reduced levels of stress, and 62% of staff took fewer sick days compared to the standard 5-day operation (2019). Research by Gallup also reported increased rates of employee wellbeing (Harter & Pendell, 2021). Owl Labs summarizes this well by stating that the increased flexibility and work-life balance afforded by the 4-day workweek “helps employees be healthier and ready to work” (Duff, 2020).\nEnvironmental and economic benefits\nBy transitioning to a 4-day workweek, employers can reduce their carbon footprint and save money. Research from the University of Massachusetts indicates that employers who transition to a 4-day workweek could reduce their carbon footprint by almost 30% (Knight et al., 2012 & Smedley, 2019). Furthermore, the Henley School of Business estimates that by implementing 4-day workweeks, UK businesses could save approximately £104 billion or $142.52 billion per year (2019). Microsoft Japan’s 4-day workweek also provided a 23% reduction in electricity costs. They also reported using 60% less paper (NPR, 2019). 4-day workweeks not only reduce the cost of overhead but also reduce the cost of commuting for employees (Rybacka, 2021).\nDrawbacks of the 4-day workweek\nWhile most researchers support the implementation of the 4-day workweek, there are some drawbacks to consider.\nPotential for decreased engagement\nResearch by Gallup indicates that although a 4-day workweek is associated with thriving and wellbeing, it also represents a decrease in workplace engagement. They claim that “the percentage of actively disengaged workers was highest for those with 4-day and 6-day work weeks” (Harter & Pendell, 2021). However, their study was done with companies that have implemented a 4-day workweek while maintaining at least 35 hours of work. The companies surveyed did not reduce their hours to the traditional 8-hour workdays and added at least 45 minutes per day and at most 2 hours per day to their employees' daily work hours. This could indicate a difference between the results of a compressed 4x10 workweek versus a shortened 4x8 workweek.\nRegardless, Harter and Pendell of Gallup conclude that employers should first focus on the quality of the workplace and state that by “working fewer days per week, employees who already feel disconnected from their employer, team, or manager are more likely to drift even farther away—from tolerating their jobs to hating them” (2021). By first examining the workplace, employers can best determine what type of 4-day workweek is most beneficial and effective for their employees.\nMuch of the benefits of a 4-day workweek extend from how employees use their extended time off. One concern for managers is that their employees will get second or third jobs to fill up their additional free time. Instead of taking the extra time off to recuperate, some employees could return to the workplace more tired than they were in the previous week. Encouraging employees to use this time to rest, recuperate, volunteer, spend time with friends, invest in family, gain new skills, and develop new hobbies can prevent these concerns as well as corporate-wide policies regarding additional jobs.\nNot for everyone\nNot all industries can adopt a 4-day workweek policy. For example, medical centers and emergency response teams need staff 24/7. This could cause scheduling challenges or conflicts if a 4-day workweek policy were implemented (Rybacka, 2021).\nLess time to complete tasks\nSometimes, when implementing a 4-day workweek, employees are given less time to do the same amount of work. This can be particularly stressful for some employees with many duties and responsibilities (Shenton, 2021). However, it is important to note that on average, the 8-hour workday does not equal 8 hours of continuous work. A survey of 1,989 adults by VoucherCloud, revealed that only 2 hours and 53 minutes out of an 8-hour workday were devoted to “actual productivity” (VoucherCloud, n.d.). By encouraging employees to monitor their time well and having clear expectations for employees and their roles, this drawback to the 4-day workweek can be effectively managed.\n“An hour of planning can save you 10 hours of doing.” -Dale Carnegie\nThings to consider\nWhen examining the potential adoption of a 4-day workweek, it is important to consider how your business will function within these 4 days. Will employees be expected to work 10 hours or the traditional 8 hours per day? Will vacation time be reduced in light of the new 3-day weekend? Will employees' pay be affected? Can your organization transition to a 4-day workweek? The Society of Human Resource Management outlines several important questions below:\nWhy are you considering a 4-day workweek? What are your goals?\nHow will you determine if a 4-day workweek is effective for your business?\nWill your entire business adopt the 4-day workweek or only some staff?\nHow will the 4-day workweek affect clients and customers? (Agovino, 2020)\nA key thing to remember when implementing a 4-day workweek is the importance of “deep work” or “the specializations and expertise that define careers and helps businesses grow” (Nagele, 2021). By encouraging employees to concentrate on completing important tasks and also providing them the resources they need to focus (quiet rooms, optional break areas, etc.), employers can help employees complete their traditional 40-hour workload in a more time-efficient manner.\n“When people tell me they’ve learned from experience, I tell them the trick is to learn from other people’s experience.” - Warren Buffett\nAs more companies transition to a 4-day workweek, businesses are sharing their experience and outcomes. Below is a list of available case studies and examples of companies that have implemented 4-day workweeks.\nThe main takeaway\nThe results reported by businesses that implemented a 4-day workweek are promising. With a variety of positive outcomes, it is currently a policy that many employers are testing. It is important to consider the differences between various 4-day workweek policies and adjust your own policy so it fits your industry, employees, and business. When implemented with precision and clarity, the 4-day workweek inspires employees to recoup, relax, and effectively use their time.\n“It is not enough to be busy… The question is: what are we busy about?” - Henry David Thoreau\n4 Day Week.

446	how much percentage entertainment agents charge from performer earnings	Agents take 10% of your fee.	"['As an actor, being represented by a talent agency means that an outside entity has a vested interest in advancing your acting career. It is a win-win situation for both. An acting education and talent are the basic components agencies look for, but to be signed by an agency you also need to understand the business of ""the business,"" be equipped with the right materials, and be prepared to compete for coveted agency spots. The more prepared you are as an actor, the better the impression you will make on an agent and his agency, and the sooner you may be signed as a working actor.\nGet a degree or training from a respected theatre college or local acting school. If neither is available, find any acting training that is available in your area. Contact your community college for a catalogue of acting classes. Join a local theatre group. Volunteer for any acting position available. Agents insist on seeing past and continuous training for any actor in which they express interest.\nEducate yourself on the different agency types. Agencies who cover acting talent for film, television and theatre are known as ""across the board"" agencies. Agents in these agencies specialize. You will rarely have the same agent for television that you have for theatre. It is important to know which facet of the industry you want representation in, and to focus your attention on that area. Never respond to an agent who asks: ""What do you do best?"" by replying, ""I can do everything."" Know your own talent and be specific.\nGo to a photographer located in the market in which you want to work, and one who is experienced in taking headshots. Agents look at a headshot for five seconds before making a decision to look at the resume on the back. If you are looking for a commercial or a television agent, take a headshot that shows good teeth and a dazzling smile. Attracting a film agent means showing a face with depth of character. Projecting a story in a headshot will grab the attention of a “legit” (theatrical) agent.\nBuild your resume with concise and honest information. Be sure it has all your necessary contact information. Include any “extra” work you have done, but not more than five appearances. Education is vital, and continuing education is a must. Special skills are especially helpful to television agents. If you ride a horse, that may be the skill that will get you an audition for a western-themed commercial or television pilot. Be sure the resume is the same size as the headshot and is stapled to the headshot in all four corners.\nKnow your industry. Stay informed by reading “Backstage” (either East or West) and the “Ross Reports,"" which give auditioning advice and updates on who’s who in the agency business. Agents move agencies frequently and these industry publications will help keep you up-to-date. They also list casting calls.\nTake your acting jobs seriously. Every acting job is another addition to your resume and an education as well. Offer your services to a local company for their advertising campaign. Maybe you won’t get paid, but it gives you training to list on your resume. Invite local agents to watch your performances and follow up with a hand-written note of thanks if they do attend.\nMake a DVD of your acting appearances. Keep it short – three minutes in total. Send it to agents with a short cover letter and a headshot/resume. Do not call for follow up. Keep sending headshots every six weeks with updates on your career, or invitations to showcases.\nThere is no specific formula for attracting an agent. The majority of the work is done by you. Narrow your targeted list of agents to the discipline that is your strongest. Work that list weekly.\nGet in front of agents. Perform in showcases and local theatre.\nHeadshots are vital. Use a photographer who knows the medium of taking headshots. Your face is what is important. Do not put your fingers on your face, or your hand under your chin. Do not stretch your arm over your head. Armpits are not attractive. Do not wear a turtleneck sweater in any of the above as it hides your neck and the look goes directly from your chin to your chest. An expansive look is what will attract an agent\'s eye and encourage him to flip the headshot over to the resume and become more acquainted with you as an actor.\nNever pay a fee to an agent for his representation. He gets paid when you work.\nAgents take 10% of your fee. A talent manager can attach whatever percentage you agree to. Be aware that if you have a talent manager and an agent, you are giving up a large percentage of your income. Choose one or the other until you are so successful you need someone managing your career. Then you can name your own percentage.\nIf an agent asks to “freelance” with you for a certain period of time, do it. This is your “dating period” and your opportunity to land jobs that will encourage him to “engage” you.\nWhen interviewing an agent, ask how many others “like you” are on his books. If the competition is deep, find another agent. You don’t want to be a small fish in a big sea.\nDon’t set your sights on the large agencies. They get their talent from the smaller agencies. Go small for the greater chance of success.']"	['<urn:uuid:1b1758ab-644b-4526-bc8f-8727e89788e7>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-01T22:47:46.423955	9	6	920

601	gary atkinson bill bentley music business experience compare	Gary Atkinson and Bill Bentley had different paths in the music business. Atkinson started as a blues fan and collector from age 13, later working in marketing and sales for magazines, and eventually becoming an agent for blues artists before acquiring Document Records in 1999-2000. Bill Bentley had a more diverse career in the music industry, serving as music editor at publications like Austin Sun and L.A. Weekly, forming a band with notable musicians, and spending 20 years at Warner Brothers Records handling major artists like Los Lobos, Elvis Costello, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.	"['Interview with Gary Atkinson of Document Records\nGary Atkinson is the current owner of Document Records, a label that specializes in hard-to-find Blues recordings.\nDocumenting our past: Interview with Document Records’ Gary Atkinson Part I\nDocument Records is providing an important service to all of humanity.\nDocument is doing what most American record labels have failed to do: Helping to preserve the rich cultural history of the United States, and carry on the rich legacy that this country has contributed to musical innovation. Document is committed to keeping the music of black culture from the early 20th century alive and available.\nAll of the label’s nearly 900 titles are in print, and available to the public. Document has a treasure trove of music that is endless in depth. The releases of their artists are meticulously catalogued and released in chronological order. They do not skip any selections, and their goal is to make the most possible music available to the public.\nThe current owner of Document is Gary Atkinson, who runs the label with his wife Gillian. Atkinson has been a lifelong fan of the music and was indoctrinated to blues culture from an early age.\n“My father was a jazz and blues fan, so I was very aware of everyone from King Oliver to Big Bill Broonzy,” he said. “When I was only about 13, I had an older brother who also became interested in the music, and he was going out and watching various musicians playing both acoustic and electric blues. The combination of my father’s records and brother’s records ended up inspiring me to get involved. I then began to play the guitar, and collect records, I amassed a pretty decent-sized collection of records over the years.”\nAtkinson’s musical tastes led him to be a bit of misfit when it came to popular culture.\n“The strange thing is when I was 13 and heavily into the likes of Blind Willie McTell and Barbecue Bob, guys in school were liking Queen and Led Zeppelin. I was into names like Black Ace, Kokomo Arnold, and Memphis Minnie among others. Consequently, school lunch time could be a very lonely experience.”\nAtkinson said he was first introduced to Document in his teens, while looking for records.\n“I was buying LP’s at the time, things from (record labels like) Origin, Biograph, and Yazoo,” he said. “There was a peculiar record label called Roots, which had nothing but track listings and a strange address in Austria. The whole thing was being produced and compiled by a name, Johnny Parth. I was around 13 at the time, and if someone said to me in years to come, ‘you will own this company,’ I would’ve been amazed. I mean I’m still amazed now.”\nAtkinson eventually began doing work in marketing and sales at various magazines around his hometown. Around 1987 he left his hometown, and became an agent for some blues artists from the states. He also began to do review work for different magazines and record companies, one of which was Document.\n“So I struck a relationship there,” he said. “In the year 2000, 1999, the former owner of Document offered the company to me.”\nAtkinson was a little shocked at the offer, but immediately jumped at the opportunity.\n“In his broken English, Johnny (Parth) asked me, ‘Do you want everything?’” Atkinson said. “By that time I had amassed quite a collection of Document CD’s, so I just assumed he meant develop the whole collection. So I said, ‘Well it’s OK Johnny, I got quite a lot of it.’ And he said, ‘No, no, I mean everything, all of it.’ I said, ‘Well you know I’ll just take it as it comes along, that’s fine.’ Well the penny dropped, and I realized that he was actually offering me the whole company, and he gave a price. I instantly said, ‘yes.’”\nThe irony that a British label holds almost all of this American music is not lost on Atkinson.\n“Yes, I suppose it is a very big catalogue,” he said. “Sometimes labels are sized by their catalogue depth. If an independent has something like 300 or 400 titles in their catalogue they’re deep in the well. Document has now close to 900 titles, and something like 22,000 to 23,000 tracks.”\nAtkinson credits Parth for blazing the trail, stating that “what Johnny did was basically a step ahead of what a lot of the guys were doing back in those days, in the ’60s.”\n“The music was not so readily available as it is now, and so collectors would put stuff onto tape and they would swap tapes and records. It was a very active community, not only nationally but worldwide. It’s in the collectors mentality and to, particularly in those days, to try and get the pieces of the jigsaw together and then put the thing together. It was in that way that they could get a profile of these musicians behind the extraordinary names that appeared on the labels. Very little was known about those musicians then, and this was the way of putting the pieces together.”\nThe expanse of the Document titles is almost overwhelming. Atkinson said that all the CD’s are not “have to have” things, but they are aimed at what he calls, “serious collectors of the most frightening kind.” He described them as “the kind of guys that if you put out three volumes, and they’ve got volume one, and they’ve got volume three, even though they don’t know what’s on volume two they can’t sleep at night because they haven’t got it.”\nAtkinson also noted that it was important to have these titles available because “as far as African-Americans are concerned, there is documentation of very different sides of their social life,” and that the records “do a lot of coloring in of the picture.”\nAccording to Atkinson, the music has universal appeal; it has the ability to be relevant to anyone with an open mind.\n“If you just go back to the beginning of all of this, my father was well into the music, but he was a white guy living on the northeast of England, he just had a natural affinity with the music,” Atkinson said. “He was able to relate to what came out of the speakers. ... The music cuts through cultures, through geographical boundaries. It cuts through politics, through religion, through everything.”\nThanks to TOMASZ LESICZA and The Athens Messenger', 'Record and Music Industry Executives who shared their insights for Johnny Winter\'s definitive biography include Bill Bentley, Rick Dobbis, Bruce Iglauer, Mike and Richard Vernon, and John Wooler.\nWhen I interviewed Bill Bentley from his office in Los Angeles, he worked in publicity at Warner Brothers Records. Bill has an impressive background in the music industry. He was a music editor at the Austin Sun and L.A. Weekly, and formed a band with Speedy Sparks (bass player for the Sir Douglas Quintet) and Will and Charlie Sexton (Arc Angels, Bob Dylan) in the late 1970s. He spent 20 years at Warner Brothers handling major artists, including Los Lobos, Elvis Costello, the Blasters, Green Day, X, Lou Reed, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, R.E.M., the Barenaked Ladies, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, and Wilco.\nA native Texan, Bill was living in Houston, but traveled to Austin to see Muddy Waters with opening act Johnny Winter at the Vulcan in August 1968. Bill was blown away by Johnny\'s performance. He shared his memories of the Vulcan Gas Company, that fateful night with Muddy and Johnny, the excitement of Johnny\'s performance, and the impact it had on Muddy. ""You could tell opening for Muddy was a big thing for him and he didn’t hold back at all,"" Bill said. ""From the very first song, he went for it. He was so good it was unbelievable . . . I think he scared Muddy a little bit . . .""\nRick Dobbis is another heavy hitter in the music business that worked with Johnny. During his 35 year career, he has been President of Sony Music International, President of PolyGram Records, and Senior Vice President of Arista Records. He currently runs an independent Global Business Management Company, where his client list includes the Rolling Stones and Yanni. Rick also produces the TV show Americana Roadhouse 411, and is a partner in Dream Jam World, a children’s entertainment company.\nIn 1974, when Johnny\'s manager Steve Paul started Blue Sky Records, a specialty label promoted and distributed by Columbia Records, he hired Rick as executive vice president and general manager. Rick explained the inner workings of the Blue Sky label, his role as a liaison between Blue Sky and Columbia, and his experiences both in and out of the studio with Steve Paul and Johnny.\nI interviewed Bruce Iglauer in Tunica, Mississippi, not far from Robinsville, where Robert Johnson spent much of his life. Bruce is founder and president of Alligator Records, with a catalog of over 200 titles and the distinction of being the largest independent blues label in the world. Bruce met Johnny in 1978 at a Son Seals show and the two clicked immediately. In 1984, he signed Johnny to his label, which released Guitar Slinger (1984), Serious Business (1985), and Third Degree (1986).\nBruce candidly shared his experiences having Johnny as a house guest, and of a live recording at the Wise Fools Pub in Chicago where Johnny sat in with Son Seals. He explained his relationship with Johnny in the studio during the sessions for the first two Alligator releases and why Johnny requested that he not be involved in the production of Third Degree. Bruce also offered insight into Johnny\'s personality, as well as the relationship between Johnny and Teddy Slatus and how Slatus\'s inability to act as an authoritative manager affected Johnny\'s s record sales and reputation.\nThe leading producer of British blues bands in the late 1960s, Mike Vernon produced the legendary Bluesbreakers John Mayall with Eric Clapton LP released by the Decca label in Britain in July 1966. He also produced the Bluesbreakers’ only album with Peter Green, and records by Chicken Shack, Duster Bennett, Savoy Brown, and Ten Years After. Mike and his brother Richard founded Blue Horizon Records, the successful British blues label that released two Fleetwood Mac albums in 1968. During the late 60s and early 70s, the label released dozens of blues records including albums by traditional blues artists such as Elmore James, Johnny Shines, Sunnyland Slim, Earl Hooker, Lightnin’ Hopkins, B.B. King, and Otis Rush. Producer\nWith Mike in the U.K. and Richard traveling back and forth from Brazil to Spain, we did our interviews through the mail. Mike and Richard shared their memories of the 1968 trip that Johnny and Keith Ferguson made to England to find a blues label willing to record a white blues artist. The Vernon brothers remembered their initial meeting and impressions of Johnny, and explained the deal they made with Johnny and how it would have taken place if a serendipitous story in the December 7, 1968 issue of Rolling Stone hadn\'t immediately changed Johnny\'s life.\nI interviewed John Wooler from his offices in Los Angeles, where he works as a music consultant and producer at Exolution Entertainment and as a music professor at Cal Poly Pomona. The president of Pointblank Records, a Virgin blues/roots imprint label he launched in 1989, Wooler was working on a deal with John Lee Hooker when he signed Johnny to the label in 1991. With 26 Grammy nominations and five wins, Wooler was well known for his expertise in the record business. He had joined Virgin Records UK as Deputy Head of A&R in 1984; within ten years he became Senior Vice President of Virgin Records US. He signed all the Pointblank artists, including John Lee Hooker, Charlie Watts, Van Morrison, John Hammond, Pops Staples, Larry McCray, Albert Collins, The Kinsey Report, and Walter ""Wolfman"" Washington.\nJohnny signed with Pointblank after Wooler assured him he would have complete creative control and the ability to do straight blues. Johnny\'s Pointblank recordings include Let Me In (1991), ""Hey Where\'s Your Brother?"" (1992) and Johnny Winter Live in NYC \'97 (1998). Producer Dick Shurman extolled John Wooler for the free rein he gave him and Johnny over those projects. Wooler shared his experiences with Johnny on a personal level and in the studio, talked about promotion for those recordings, and explained why then manager Teddy Slatus\'s attempt to start his own imprint label for Johnny never came to fruition.']"	['<urn:uuid:f90d1324-8c59-47ec-8480-d38f6f6501c1>', '<urn:uuid:5d8c1a7e-119f-4d0f-a738-4fdb5baea417>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-01T22:36:12.692263	8	96	2090
996	What should clients verify about contractors' qualifications and insurance?

Additionally, when hiring contractors, clients should check references from recent customers and evaluate their track record to ensure satisfaction, while also confirming their understanding of local construction laws and regulations.	['Just as any employer would interview a prospective job candidate, you’ll need to do the same before you employ a contractor to build or remodel your home. Vetting a prospective construction company is crucial to understanding the type of service you will receive and is a major indicator of how satisfied you will be upon the project’s completion.\nTo properly understand what kind of service you will be getting from a prospective contractor, it is necessary to ask them a series of questions to gain an understanding about the company.

Can I See It?\nSeeing that and how contractors are insured are of equal importance. You’ll want to make sure whatever builder you hire is not just insured but properly insured, as they should have both liability insurance and workers’ compensation for all construction and remodeling projects.\nWhat Are Your Strengths And Weaknesses?\nAsking a prospective builder about their strengths and weaknesses can help to tailor their services to the needs of your project.

Legal issues related to construction activities can arise from local, state and federal laws. Federal statutes such as employment laws, workplace safety and regulation and changes in the worksite hiring practices. Some states may impose additional regulations on existing federal laws. County and city ordinances may also impose additional restrictions on construction noise and zoning.\nBefore you begin any construction process, it is essential that you understand the construction laws in your area. All levels of the government play a role in construction regulation and issues can arise in many ways. Common construction-related disputes at workplace include construction defects, injuries, accidents, contact issues and problems associated with obtaining planning and building permits.\nFinancial issues are some common legal issues that may arise during a repair or construction project. Some construction projects can go over budgets because of unexpected material or labor costs. Alternatively, some clients may refuse to pay the construction companies for products that do not meet their expectations.\nWhat If Legal Issues Arise?\nWhen such legal issues arise, the contractor should have a good grasp of construction law. Many constructors will seek help when such financial problems occur and it is imperative that you understand construction law to prevent incurring further costs and financial difficulties.\nThe existing government plays an integral part in construction law. When bidding, the contractors must pay close attention to job specifications to ensure compliance and the laws relating to the project. A construction contract provides a legally binding document between the builder and contractor. The contract covers how the job will be done and amount of the compensation or the total cost of the project.\nThere are different types of construction contracts in the industry. The details about specific terms such as quality, duration and specifications are some of the common aspects that cannot be underestimated in any construction activity. Construction law indicates that there should be a clear indication of the contract type.\nA fixed price contract includes overall construction related activities and may include other benefits such as early termination, liquidated damages and late termination fees. Lump sum fees are preferred when there is a defined scheduled and clear close.\nThe contract is used when risks is transferred from the builder to the owner and in cases where the builder want to avoid change orders for unspecified work. However, the contract must include some percentage in monetary terms for the risks involved in carrying out such a risk.\nCost-plus contracts usually cover payments of the actual costs, expenses and other purchases that are generated from the construction activity. Cost plus contracts have specific information about the re-negotiated amount to include material and labor costs. The costs must be detailed and put under the classification of indirect or direct costs.\nMaterial and time contracts are used when the scope of the project is not clear or it has not been defined. The owner of the contract must establish daily or hourly rates which include additional expenses that could arise during the construction process. The costs should be classified as markup, direct, indirect and all information on the construction law should be considered\nWhy Do I Need To Know Construction Law?\n- Why Do I Need To Know Construction Law?\nIt is important to get a grasp of construction law because it will help you from having to cover unnecessary costs that may occur during the process. A construction attorney will perform a number of functions which include review of documents to determine if there are any potential risks for the clients.\nMoreover, he will ensure that all provisions included in the construction laws protect your interest. When dealing with home or commercial real estate property, some lenders will require that you have an attorney or construction lawyer.\nThis will help in relieving burden of proof especially on the builder. The lawyer will define for you the functions of each party. The construction lawyer will help you understand the aspects that are covered in the contact in relation to sale or purchase of commercial or real estate properties.\nThe essence of having construction law knowledge cannot be underestimated. You should protect your own interest if your are constructing a building. Especially if you have borrowed the money, you cannot pay huge interest costs and still make a mistake in dealing with the construction of the property.\nWhy You Should Have All The Information Through The Construction Process?\nYou should have all the information to help you through the construction process. In some jurisdictions, it is a legal requirement that you include a construction lawyer in the transaction. These states provide lawyers who are authorized to practice construction law. These states will require that you provide a lawyer before the construction process begins.\nSome challenges during the construction process include costs, labor, and noise, environmental issues, among others. You may not be able to deal with all these alone. When you have a construction law professional, you will be able to make the right choice.\nUnderstating the complexities involved throughout the construction process is a feature that any building or commercial real estate owner will want to know. You should know all the information on zoning disputes, historical properties, water rights, gas rights, and adverse possession of claims, among others. Having a construction attorney will save you money in the end because you can deal with emerging issues quickly and clearly. In addition, you are likely to have a high value property when you involve a construction lawyer during the process.']	['<urn:uuid:c2e595f8-50ce-40d7-bb11-7effe60d9d1e>', '<urn:uuid:7085eee7-c91a-4dc8-a454-847e3f8c99d4>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-02T10:56:22.807332	9	77	1772
1084	Could you explain the evolution of Agana Heights from its pre-World War II status to its current state as a modern community, including how its population and infrastructure have developed?	Before World War II, Agana Heights was primarily farmland used by residents of Hagåtña. After World War II ended in 1944, it became a resettlement community for many residents of old Hagåtña. The area has since transformed into a thriving cosmopolitan community. Today, the village features a mix of beautiful homes with gated and manicured lawns, quaint residential homes, apartment complexes, and various religious buildings. The village hosts major institutions including the U.S. Naval Hospital Marianas, multiple churches, and organizations like the Elks Club and the Shriners Club. As of the 2000 U.S. Census, the population was recorded at 5,200 people. The village is now divided into several sections: As Apugan, Tipugan, Fonte, Hilaan, Taigigao and Charito.	['Get to know Guam: Agana Heights a good place to start\nGet to know Guam: Agana Heights a good place to start\nEtitor’s note: The U.S. territory of Guam is comprised of 22 villages, many with their own distinct character, history and points of interest. Stripes Guam and Guampedia have joined forces to present this weekly feature on each of them in the hopes that it will help our readers get out – and get to know – our gracious hosts. To learn more about Guam’s people, history, culture and places, visit: guampedia.com\nAgana Heights sits just above the capital city of Hagåtña and was a resettlement community for many residents of old Hagåtña after World War II ended in 1944. Agana Heights is one of two villages (the other is Santa Rita), that does not derive its name from a Chamorro word.\nBefore it was a village, many say the area was called Tutujan. Some village elders say that the place name Tutujan is derived from the Chamorro word “tutuhon” which means ‘to begin,’ ‘start,’ or ‘set out.’ However, other elders say the tutuhan name is derived from the name of a trail along the cliffline between Fort Santa Agueda (also known as Fort Apugan) and Government House.\nBefore World War II, Agana Heights was primarily farm land for the residents of Hagåtña. It was also the site for the Spanish militia’s “lookout” for incoming ships and possible danger.\nThat site today is Fort Santa Agueda, also known as Fort Apugan, which is a popular tour site because of its panoramic view of the island’s capital city, bay of Hagåtña, the Philippine Sea, and the sheer northern clifflines of Oka Point and Urunao Point.\nBefore World War II, the U.S. military used the area where the U.S. Naval Hospital Marianas now stands for officer’s quarters and a sick bay. During the war, the Japanese military used the facilities for training carrier pigeons as a means of communication. After the recapture of the island by U.S. forces, the facilities were utilized as an internment camp for prisoners of war.\nToday, Agana Heights is home of two of the island’s oldest organizations, the Elks Club and the Shriners Club. It also has all the major religious churches; the Agana Heights General Baptist Church; Our Lady of the Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church; the Seventh Day Adventist Church; the Scottish Rite Temple; and the Christian Science Church.\nAgana Heights is also the birthplace of Little League Baseball on Guam where in 1955, the first Little League game was played. The Agana Heights team won three consecutive championships in 1955, 1956 and 1957.\nThe Agana Heights Cougars, a major league team, also won the first Guam Major League Baseball Championship which was held in 1974. Today, many baseball teams continue to play for the village.\nThis village at a glance\nPopulation: The U.S. Census in 2000 listed Agana Heights population at 5,200. As of November 09, 2010 official census population figures are unavailable.\nVillage officials: The current mayor is Paul M. McDonald who was first elected in 1992, making him one of the two longest serving village mayors.\nCommissioners/Mayors: Paul M. McDonald, Mayor, 1993-Present; Frank M. Portusach, Commissioner/Mayor, 1977-1992; Juan E. Garcia, Commissioner, 1969-1977; Juan L.

The sections of the village are As Apugan, Tipugan, Fonte, Hilaan, Taigigao and Charito. Fonte River divides Agana Heights from Maina village and Taigigao Street is the boundary separating Agana Heights from Ordot/Chalan Pago. Sinajana village and Agana Heights village are also separated by a shared roadway.\nPrior to World War II, Agana Heights was a farming community for residents who lived in Hagåtña. Today, sprinkled throughout the village are some beautiful homes with gated and manicured lawns, quaint residential homes, apartment complexes, and a row of buildings that serve as homes to different religious denominations and organizations. Agana Heights has been transformed into a thriving cosmopolitan community.\nAgana Heights is home to historic Fort Apugan, also known as Fort Santa Agueda, located next to Government House. The village of Agana Heights also features Tutujan Park, completed in 2002, also known as “Triangle Park” for the triangular shape it takes as it located at the fork – in the middle of the road – that separates San Ramon Hill from Pale’ Kiernan Drive.\nPOINTS OF INTEREST\nFort Santa Agueda: This bateria (battery), built during the administration of Spanish Governor Manuel Muro (1794-1802), was developed for tactical purposes. It sits atop Apugan Hill and is also commonly called Fort Apugan. It is one of the few surviving Spanish forts on Guam. It provides a commanding view of the capital village of Hagåtña, the Philippine Sea, and the sheer northern clifflines of Oka Point and Ritidian Point. The fort is also in a prime location to study the northern topography of the island with its raised limestone plateau.\nFonte River: This river is the border of Agana Heights and Maina. A bridge across the Fonte River is the the topic of a local ghost story about the “White Lady.” It is also the location of the first dam built on Guam, the Libugon Dam. This dam was the main source of fresh water for the capital city of Hagåtña prior to World War II. The Fonte Valley River remains a popular swimming spot and hiking trail.\nSgt. Pedro C. Pangelinan Baseball Field: One of Guam’s first and oldest baseball fields is the Agana Heights Sgt. Pedro C. Pangelinan baseball field, named after the Guam soldier killed in action in 1968 in Vietnam. The ball park was developed in 1949 and completed in 1951 and was the site of the first Little League Baseball game on Guam.\nThe Cliff: Seated along one of Agana Height’s clifflines, The Cliff, is one Guam’s first hotels. It was established in Agana Heights in 1959. It has more recently become a business and residential condominium.\nTutujan Park: Tutujan Park, also known as “Triangle Park”, complete with water and power was built in 2002, funded by the A.B. Won Pat Guam International Airport Authority. For a small fee, the park can be reserved for private functions through the Agana Heights mayor’s office.\nAgana Heights Elementary School: This school is one of 27 elementary schools within the Guam Public School System’s current (as of 2010) inventory of forty-one public schools. It was opened in 1958 and has grades kindergarten through fifth.\nArchbishop’s Residence: The Archbishop’s Residence was constructed in the early 1960’s. The late Catholic Bishop Apollinaris W. Baumgartner was the first to take residency. Archbishop Anthony Apuron currently resides at this cliffside residence.\nElks Club: The Elk’s Club is one of Guam’s oldest organizations established before World War II. The club house was located in Hagåtña and was relocated after the war to its present site in Agana Heights.\nGeneral Baptist Memorial Church: One of the island’s first Baptist churches, this church was built in 1955. It is one of the first buildings located among a row of religious institutions along one of the village’s main roads.\nGovernment House: The architectural design of the governor’s official residence incorporates elements of both Chamorro and Spanish-cultural heritage. Its design was completed in 1951 by renowned architect Richard Nuetra. The structure has undergone several renovations as new governors took office and after the island was devastated by typhoons.\nMaria Artero Catholic Pre-School and Kindergarten: Nestled in the middle of the village, this school is one several Catholic Schools of the Archdiocese of Agana’s school system.\nOur Lady of the Blessed Sacrament Church: The Agana Heights Catholic Church, dedicated in 1951, sits in the center of the village. It underwent a major renovation in 1995 after the structure was continually damaged by series of typhoons in the early 1980s and a powerful earthquake in 1993. The annual village fiesta of Our Lady of the Blessed Sacrament is celebrated in November.\nScottish Rite Masonic Center: This organization was formed in 1899.

1054	For fire departments looking to implement safety drills, what are the essential steps in practicing self-contained breathing apparatus maintenance and connection?	The training drill requires an SCBA, spare cylinder, and face piece. The process involves: checking the SCBA's working condition, changing out the cylinder and tugging back to verify connection, donning the SCBA on the firefighter's back, fully opening the cylinder, connecting the MMR to the face piece and starting air flow by breathing, tugging on the MMR to verify face piece connection, and finally doffing the regulator and shutting down the SCBA. The drill should be repeated as necessary.	['Photos by author\nSome self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) manufacturers are designing their cylinders to have a quick connect for the cylinder to be attached to the high-pressure hose feeding the reducing block. This quick connect allows for a faster change time between cylinders and to make the process easier. Most SCBA cylinders will have a threaded valve that will screw right into the high-pressure hose, making an airtight connection. It does take a few turns to make the connection and this process does add a bit if time. There is also a potential for cross threading if done in a hurry or in an improper manner. The threaded type of connection ensures that you have an airtight and locked connection.\nRELATED FIREFIGHTER TRAINING\nThe quick connect as shown in the two pictures has one inherent problem, namely the possibility of the connection not snapping in correctly. The lights and sound may activate, indicating the connection, only to have the valve pop back out once the cylinder is opened. Ensure that your connection is made by pulling back on the cylinder valve, as an attempt to pull it back out. If connected properly, it should not come out.\nThe majority of SCBAs also have a mask-mounted regulator (MMR) that connects the low-pressure air hose to the face piece, which allows the firefighter to breathe. The MMR is a technological advancement in the SCBA, replacing the belt-mounted regulator of the older generation of SCBAs. In photo 3 below, you can see one type of SCBA MMR connected to the face piece. The MMR is connected correctly to the face piece and you can see that there is no gap between the MMR and the face piece receptacle.\nIn photo 4, you will see an improperly connected MMR to the face piece. You can see a gap present between the MMR and the face piece. The problem that can occur here with the MMR is that air flow will be initiated upon inhalation by the firefighter, but the connection is not complete. The MMR will pop back out once any physical movement occurs. There have been times in training and an emergency scene where the MMR has popped back out due to a faulty connection. To ensure that the connection has been made correctly, pull back on the MMR to try and pull it back out. If connected properly, it will pull the face piece with the MMR.\nA simple training drill is to practice the changeout of a SCBA cylinder as well as donning and doffing the MMR from the mask.\nEquipment needed: SCBA, spare cylinder, face piece\nGoal: To practice and become familiar with “the SCBA tug.”\n- Check in the SCBA to make sure that it is in working condition.\n- Change out the cylinder. Put a new cylinder in and, once connected, tug back on the connection to ensure that it is connected\n- Don the SCBA on the back of the firefighter, open the cylinder fully, and go on air.\n- When connecting the MMR to the face piece, start the flow of air by breathing.\n- Take one hand and tug on the MMR away from the face piece to ensure that it is connected to the mask.\n- Once done, doff the regulator and shut down the SCBA.\n- Repeat as necessary.\n- When connecting a quick connect or snap-in cylinder, gently pull back on the connection to ensure it is connected.\n- When connecting the MMR to the face piece, tug back on the regulator to ensure a connection.\nMark van der Feyst has been in the fire service since 1999 and is a full-time firefighter in Ontario, Canada.

1258	What do Lusitania's exploration difficulties and organic farming's yield issues share?	The Lusitania exploration faced severe challenges including limited visibility for divers examining the wreck and dangerous storms that threatened the expedition. Similarly, organic farming faces significant yield limitations compared to conventional farming, with documented lower per-acre yields due to limited pesticide options and difficulties meeting peak fertilizer demand, which could increase pressure for land-use conversion.	"['“To me she was my dream ship. I saw her first when in her regal beauty she sped along the surface of the Clyde upon her trials. My boyish heart went out to her in admiration.”\nThat was Albert Arthur Bestic\'s first impression upon seeing the new Lusitania. The next time he saw her, he was on a small windjammer. As he looked up at the liner, he saw, ""a photographic impression of four big funnels, tiers of decks, fluttering handkerchiefs, the name \'Lusitania\' in gold letters, and a roaring bow wave."" When the ship ""streaked by"", it created a large wave that sent all the men into the lee scuppers. The sailors began cursing at her, but not Bestic. He vowed one day that he would stand upon the bridge of that ship!\nBestic itself is not a name of Irish origin. The branch that Albert descended from was originally from the Huguenot French in the Normandy region of France. He was the second child of Arthur and Sarah Stephenson, born on August 26, 1890. He had an older sister Olive who was born in 1888. The family resided in Donnybrook, Dublin South. His father was a banker and a wood worker. He was educated at the Portsmouth Grammar School and the St. Andrew\'s School.\nThe sea called to Bestic in 1908 and he joined the sailing ship, Denbigh Castle, of the Robert Thomas & Co, as an apprentice. It sailed from Cardiff, Wales and it\'s destination was Peru. As soon as he was aboard, he was told his new nickname would be \'Paddy\' as he was from Dublin. Very much the novice, he nearly strangled the Captain with the rope from the ship\'s flags by making as he called it, \'a slippery hitch.\' Although he expected the worse, the Captain took pity and the punishment was minimal. The ship, which was delivering patent fuel, had a treacherous crossing. The Denbigh Castle suffered many storms and at one point a sailor on board said that Davy Jones had been ""foiled again"". It was feared lost until it finally sailed into Fremantle, Australia and proceeded to it\'s final destination of Peru. It had taken well over a year to get there. This did not deter Bestic and he continued to work his way up. He also became acquainted with Annie Queenie Elizabeth Kent, originally of Belfast but living in England. They continued their courtship and were married in early 1915.\nHe sailed to the US as an officer aboard the Leyland liner, Californian. To his great surprise, he was informed that his next assignment would be as the junior third officer of the Lusitania- his dream ship! Ironically, the next name after Bestic on the seaman\'s discharge book that also lists substitutes engaged was David Craig McCormick, who was became the Lusitania\'s junior telegraphist. Looking around at his new surroundings, he thought to himself, ""Would not fate put me in command of her someday?""\nQuick introductions were made to his fellow officers. He found Staff Captain Jock Anderson to be friendly and that put him at ease. First officer Arthur Rowland Jones of Flintshire had a ""grim"" appearance, but was most likely concerned with duties that needed to be done. His relaxation was perusing his five volumes by Conrad in his cabin. Percy Hefford, like himself had only been recently married. One bit advice he was given was to avoid socializing too much with the passengers, especially the ladies.\nThe boat drill was held but as he later noted, his lifeboats were not lowered due to a coal barge directly underneath them. The ship set sail and the junior third officer settled into his duties which included, his watches on the bridge, completing meteorological forms, the log book, late night tours with Hefford, and baggage room, which he detested. He was there to make sure nothing was ""pilfered"" while crew searched for a passengers trunk. His off duty activity was playing bridge in the officer\'s smoke room with whichever officers might be available. He remembered one game being interrupted by a knock on the door. ""The quartermaster appeared at the door with a four-stranded Turk\'s Head in his hand. \'Captain\'s compliments and he says he wants another of these made.\' The bridge had to be stopped and we spent the rest... trying to remember how it was made.""\nOne night before the disaster always stuck out in his memory.\n""Looking into the ballroom where dancing and gaiety held sway, my thoughts flew to that famous dance given by the Duchess of Richmond in Brussels on the eve of Waterloo... I still wonder if it was a premonition of disaster.""\nThe day of the disaster dawned and Bestic went about his duties. He was on the 8-to-12 watch and took the soundings due to the intense fog. He also telephoned down about the fire drill. Ex-Chief Stevens then took his place and Bestic left and had his lunch as always at 1 o\'clock. Soon after, baggage master Crank came to him and informed him that, ""he was about to get the baggage on deck preparatory for discharge on our arrival at Liverpool, and that already a working party awaited my arrival."" Realizing that he was in his good uniform, he went back to change into his old one that he used for such occasion. He had just finished and was in the officer\'s smokeroom when the Lusitania was struck.\n""I heard an explosion... and went out on the bridge and I saw the track of the torpedo. It seemed to be fired in line with the bridge and it seemed to strike the ship between the second and third funnels as far as I could see... the possibility of the Lusitania being doomed never entered my head. A crippled engine maybe, followed by a limp into Queenstown would be, to my mind, the climax of disaster. Then inexorably, the facts were forced into my brain. The heavy list, the settling down by the bows... I heard the order, \'hard-a-starboard\' and I heard Captain Turner saying, \'lower the boats down to the level of the rail and I went to my section of boats... My section was from 2 to 10.""\nResearchers have relied on a book that purports to quote Bestic as having said that the list caused the lifeboats on the portside to drop onto the deck and slide down towards the bow. The effect of this was leaving bloody and broken bodies in their wake. However, reading through Bestic\'s testimony and many accounts that he wrote- he never said such a thing. Whether he added this to his MS, \'Waveswept\' or authors added this to add to the story is unclear. As it stands, no chaos like that ever occurred on the ship.\nStaff Captain Anderson was by Bestic\'s side trying to assist in getting the boats away. They were trying to lower boat 10, but it didn\'t quite make it over the side of the deck. ""Captain Anderson was beside me and he said, \'Go to the bridge and tell them they are to trim her with the port tanks.\' I made my way to the bridge and sung out that order to Mr. Hefford, the second officer. He repeated it and came back again and no. 10 boat was on the deck. We tried to push it out but could not."" He later noted that when trying to lower the port boats they would scrape down the side of the ""sloping hull"" rendering them unseaworthy.\n""A dreadful cry arose which chilled my heart and blood. I turned rapidly and looked aft. The stern of the mighty vessel had risen out of the water. Like a flash I whipped around. The bow was gone."" Peering over the side, he saw that the boat deck was only a few feet above water. He stepped over the side, with no lifebelt, and began swimming away. Thinking he had escaped, he found him self being drawn down in a ""hole"" in the ocean. He was going downward and downward in the whirlpool. Finally, he felt the suction had ceased and he began his swim upwards. He broke the surface, but was briefly pulled back down again by a drowning person. The next time he came up he cracked his head. Unable to sea, he wondered if he was blind, but soon realized he was underneath an upturned boat. Diving downwards, he came up alongside the boat and was pulled in by a crewman named Quinn. No sooner did he began to get his bearings, he realized many people were trying to clamber aboard. The craft was in danger of sinking, so he took to the water again. Using a side stroke, he took off and swam right into a collapsible. It was awash, but nearby he found some floating water tanks to help the buoyancy of his refuge. ""I knew I was saved.""\nHe helped rescue other people from the water and a few hours later was picked up by the trawler Bluebell. He soon found himself face-to-face with Captain Turner. Their encounter was brief and the officer congratulated his captain on his escape. Turner, in his gruff way, turned to Bestic, whom he always called Bisset, said, ""You aren\'t that fond of me."" Bestic was back in his native land, but under tragic circumstances. The return was short and soon he was back in England preparing for his testimony before Lord Mersey. They questioned him on the seaworthiness of the lifeboats. Although he said he checked the gear, he was unaware of the condition of the boats themselves. This put the Lusitania behind him for the time being.\nA year after the sinking, his wife gave birth to their first child, Desmond Arthur. The war was raging and Bestic was serving in the Royal Navy aboard minesweepers. He suffered a few losses when his mother died in 1917 and his sister ran away with a boy she met at college when both families disapproved of the match. They disappeared without a trace, much to his regret. His second son, George Stephenson was born in Scotland in 1919. His career at sea continued as a captain of several relief vessels with the Commissioners of Irish Lights. His last child, Alan Kent was born in 1922 in Richmond. The Lusitania was never far from his mind and in 1932, the Railey expedition contacted him to join them to explore the wreck. Unfortunately, it never really went anywhere. However, a few years later, a Captain Henry Russell financed by the Argonaut Corporation invited him and fellow survivor Robert Chisholm to join him in exploring the wreck. He joined the expedition as chief officer aboard the ship, Orphir. He noted there would be a number of false trails, but he was confident that Lusitania would be located using Cunard data, Captain Turner\'s notes and his own memories. They were using a new marconi detecting device that would aid them in finding her. Remarkably, he predicted that since the ship would be on it\'s side, due the pressure it would be somewhat flattened. The Orphir encountered such a horrific storm that Bestic ordered the wireless operator to prepare to send a message. Visibility was non-existant and huge green waves washed over the decks. The howling wind increased as it whipped through the mast and roared down the ventilators. As it was twenty years ago, the former Lusitania officer was in charge of the port side boats and ordered his crew to stand-by. Heading back to Kinsale, they had a near collision with a Dutch boat, Parnevele, when it crossed the Orphir\'s bows.\nThe divers would be Jim Jarrett and Ernest Pope. A reporter, Gilbert McAllister, on board the expedition described the diving gear as ""weirder than Frankenstein"". The news that traveled back home fascinated people. Survivor Robert Timmis was now blind, but listened to daily radio reports of the expedition while, Lady Rhondda declared she would like to dive to the Lusitania herself. A barrister named James Burke was interviewed as he had seen the Lusitania sink from the shore. His room-mate at University College, Cork was Dr. McDermott who was drowned. He added the curious fact that the locals refused to eat fish for over a year as the fish had been ""feeding"" off the Lusitania victims.\nThe expedition turned perilous as Jim Jarrett was diving. An anchor was caught by the currents and flung against his suit, just missing the glass of his helmet. He was raised back to the surface after his near-death experience, but soon asked to try again. Sadly, in the midst of the expedition, Bestic was fired by the owners as he refused to give up his book rights. He went ashore in September of 1935. Finally, in October, the ship was believed to be found. The new chief officer Horn requested that the Orphir of 500 yeards out of its limits, ""just for luck"". The able seaman at the helm soon shouted, ""There\'s something Sir."" The graph showed an outline of a large shipwreck. Jarrett finally dove to the wreck, he saw painfully little due to limited visibility, but had the remarkable experience of walking across the liner\'s ""slime covered plates"". Though the ship had been located, dreams of finding and recovering gold supposedly aboard the sunken vessel were unrealistic and the expedition was ended.\nBestic kept himself busy, and in an exclusive interview he wrote for the New York Times, he talked with Captain William Turner aboard their experiences aboard the shipwreck. Turner was ""certain"" the ship was struck twice and said there was no gold, but ""alot of money and jewelry in the pursers safes.""\nHe found his former commander to have the same ""alertness of manner and the same quick penetrating look in his sharp blue eyes. But his quarterdeck manner had softened considerably."" He also wrote that Turner said he was ""distinctly worried"" about being torpedoed on that voyage. Bestic made the error of saying he was the only surviving officer, which prompted a newspaper rebuttal by the senior third officer, John Idwal Lewis.\nA final near disaster nearly killed Bestic. He was serving as commander aboard the Light ship Isolda when in December 1940, she was bombed and sunk. Six men were killed, but not Bestic. Poor vision and a touch of heart trouble forced him to retire from the sea and he found himself writing more articles as a new career. He helped Adolph Hoehling with certain details of the 1915 shipwreck, for a book called, Last Voyage of the Lusitania. His own book about his adventures aboard the Denbigh Castle called, Kicking Canvas was published a few years later and was well received. He now lived in Bray and was considered a local authority on the sea. He also wrote an article about a documentary he was involved with regarding the Light exploration of the Lusitania. It also became a reunion of several survivors, some of whom he had not seen since 1915. It was entitled, So I Shall See the Lusitania Again. He was finally able to see footage of his lost ""dream ship."" As Christmas time approached, Bestic took ill and passed away on December 20, 1962. He was buried in family vault in St. Michan\'s Parish Church in Dublin.\nPhoto of Albert Bestic courtesy of his descendants.\nPhoto of Lusitania boat deck (1915) courtesy of Michael Poirier.\nRelates to Ship:\nLeave a comment\nAdd a new story to Encyclopedia Titanica\nLink and cite this article\nPlease link to this page using the following URL\nOr copy the link text below\nIf you need to cite this page please copy the following and adapt as necessary for your referencing system:\nMichael Poirier and Jim Kalafus (2010) Lest We Forget : Albert Arthur BesticGare Maritime (ref: #11557, accessed 9th March 2014 04:11:08 PM)\nURL : http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/lusitania-bestic.html\nAdded to Encyclopedia Titanica Monday 2nd August 2010, last updated Sunday 9th March 2014.', 'The guiding principal of organic is to rely exclusively on natural inputs. That was decided early in the 20th century, decades before before the scientific disciplines of toxicology, environmental studies and climate science emerged to inform our understanding of how farming practices impact the environment.\nAs both farming and science have progressed, there are now several cutting edge agricultural practices which are good for the environment, but difficult or impossible for organic farmers to implement within the constraints of their pre-scientific rules.\nThere was one window during which the rules for organic might have been adjusted to reflect a more modern understanding. In 1990 the US Congress charged the USDA with the task of setting a national standard for what products could be legally sold as Organic. That agency was inclined to include more science in a definition of “what is safest for us and for the environment,” but the organic community of that day was adamant that the rule should only reflect the purely natural definition embraced by their existing customer base. Long before the final Organic Standards were published in 2002, it was clear that the industry preference had prevailed and that the rules of organic would still reflect their pre-scientific origins. That is why the following six environmental issues exist for organic farming.\n1. Less Than Optimal Fungicides\nOrganic farmers use pesticides, but only those qualified as sufficiently natural. Thus, copper-based fungicides are among the few options available to an organic grower for the control of fungal plant diseases. These are high-use rate products that require frequent re-application and which are quite toxic to aquatic invertebrates. There are much more effective, and far less toxic, synthetic fungicide options without environmental issues, and which, unlike copper, break down into completely innocuous materials. Organic growers can\'t use those fungicides. Similarly there are many environmentally benign, synthetic insecticides and herbicides which cannot be used.\n2. A Surprisingly High Carbon Footprint for Compost\nThe greatest original contribution of the early organic movement was its focus on building soil health. One of the main ways that organic farmers do this is by physically incorporating tons of organic matter into the soil in the form of composts. Unfortunately, during the process of composting a substantial amount of methane is emitted which means that broad use of this soil-building approach would be problematic from a climate change point of view.\n3. Practical Barriers to Implementing No-till Farming\nThe best approach to building soil quality is minimizing soil disturbance (e.g. no plowing or tilling) combined with the use of cover crops. Such farming systems have multiple environmental advantages, particularly with respect to limiting erosion and nutrient movement into water. Organic growers frequently do plant cover crops, but without effective herbicides, they tend to rely on tillage for weed control. There are efforts underway to find a way to do organic no-till, but they are not really scalable.\n4. Difficulties Implementing Optimized Fertilization\nFertilizers are associated with many of the biggest environmental issues for agriculture because of the challenges in supplying all a crop needs without leading to movement of those nutrients into surface or ground water or to emissions of the highly potent greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide. The best practice is to “spoon feed” the nutrients through the irrigation system at levels designed to closely track the changing demands of the crop throughout the season.\nDrip Irrigated and Fertilized Grapes\nThis requires water-soluble forms of the nutrients and that is very expensive to do for the natural fertilizer sources allowed in organic. Since the plants absorb those nutrients in exactly the same molecular forms regardless of source, this cost barrier is a non-scientific impediment to doing the best thing from an environmental point of view. Organic fertilizers like composts or manures are also much less practical for variable rate application, an environmentally beneficial option for rain-fed crops in which different amounts of fertilizer are applied to different parts of the field based on geo-referenced soil and yield mapping data. Finally, the organic avoidance of ""synthetic fertilizers"" would mean that these growers would not be able to use what appear to be promising small-scale, carbon-neutral, renewable energy-driven systems for making nitrogen fertilizers.\n5. Lower Land-Use-Efficiency\nThe per-acre yields of organic crops are significantly lower than those for conventional. This has been well documented both by meta-analysis of published research comparisons and by public data generated through USDA commercial production surveys.\nThe shortfall is driven by limited pesticide options, difficulties in meeting peak fertilizer demand, and in some cases by not being able to use biotech traits. If organic production were used for a significant proportion of crop production, these lower yields would increase the pressure for new land-use-conversion - a serious environmental issue because of the biodiversity and greenhouse gas ramifications.\n6. Lack of an Economic Model to Move Beyond Niche Status\nFinally, agriculture needs to change in ways that accomplish both productivity and environmental goals. That optimal farming approach must become the dominant system over time. Even if organic had maintained its growth trend from 1995 to 2008, organic acreage in 2050 would still have represented less than 3% of US cropland.\n|Trend line for US organic cropland as of of 2008|\nThen, between 2008 and 2011, USDA survey data showed no net gain in US organic acreage. Environmentally desirable ""conventional"" practices like no-till, cover cropping and a variety of other precision agriculture innovations are already practiced on a much broader scale and have the potential to be economically attractive for farmers without any price premium mechanisms. Innovations in farmland leases could greatly accelerate the conversion process if growers could be guaranteed long-term control of fields so that they could profit from their investments in building soil quality.\nConsumers Who Want To Do The Right Thing\nThere are many consumers who are willing to spend more for organic food because they believe that they are making a positive difference for the environment. While it is commendable that people are willing to do that, the pre-scientific basis for the organic rules means that the environmental superiority of organic cannot be assumed. While “only natural” is appealing as a marketing message, it is not the best guide for how to farm with minimal environmental impact. Between rigorous, science-based regulation, public and private investments in new technology development, and farmer innovation, modern agriculture has been making excellent environmental progress. That trend, not organic, is what we need to encourage.\nYou are encouraged to comment here and/or to email me at email@example.com\nPennsylvania farm image from USDA Images. Vineyard image Agne27.

462	As an aviation engineer, what causes ice formation on aircraft and how is it monitored for safety?	Ice forms when supercooled water droplets impact aircraft surfaces, most severely at temperatures just below 0°C. The severity depends on droplet size and quantity, with larger droplets producing more concerning clear/glaze ice. For safety, aircraft undergo mandatory inspections before flights, with busy planes checked multiple times daily and grounded if issues are found. Maintenance procedures are conducted monthly for minor checks and every two months for major inspections.	"[""If you wish to contribute or participate in the discussions about articles you are invited to join SKYbrary as a registered user\nIce Formation on Aircraft\nThis article aims to address the basics of ice formation on aircraft and in their engine air inlets. It does not consider the formation of frost which is created by sublimation, the process by which water vapour freezes directly onto sub zero surfaces. With this exception, the formation of ice attached to the external surface of an aircraft or to the surfaces within its engine air intakes, requires that liquid water drops impact the surface involved. Usually, that moisture must be supercooled, that is it must be in liquid form below 0°C273.15 K\n491.67 °R. There are a couple of specific variations in this general scenario which will be considered later:\n- issues relating to the difference between the temperature of the aircraft skin and the temperature of the air through which it is, has been or will be passing, especially during climb and descent and in the temperature range +/-10 degrees Celsius.\n- issues arising from the temperature and/or pressure difference between the ambient air and air within engine air inlets, most often reductions in air pressure or increases in air temperature.\nIce from Supercooled Moisture\nIce which accretes on the external parts of an aircraft is most often the result of the impact of supercooled water droplets of various sizes on that aircraft. This may happen within cloud or when flying through precipitation. The reason why water droplets do not all freeze as soon as the ambient temperature falls below 0°C273.15 K\n491.67 °R is the release of latent heat as water changes state to ice. So much latent heat is released that the change of state is slowed down so that it takes place progressively as temperature continues to fall. This continues until, by about -20°C253.15 K\n455.67 °R, most of the by now supercooled water has turned to ice. Ice grains which have already fully formed and are dry when they impact an aircraft do not adhere but simply bounce off. Therefore, the relative severity of ice accretion can be expected to progressively decrease as ambient temperature reduces below 0°C273.15 K\n491.67 °R so that little, if any, risk of accretion remains below -20°C253.15 K\n455.67 °R. Two factors are important in respect of supercooled water droplets:\n- the extent of their presence, which will affect the rate of any ice accretion; and\n- their size, which will affect the severity of that accretion by adversely influencing its rate.\nBoth the quantity and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the droplet sizes of supercooled water in cloud are greatest at temperatures just below 0°C273.15 K\n491.67 °R and both decrease as temperature falls. The size of the supercooled water droplets is very important in respect of the potential to induce ice accretion. Larger droplets have greater inertia and are less influenced by the airflow around the aircraft than smaller droplets so they will impinge on more of the aircraft surface than smaller droplets. This is especially the case in respect of the in-flight air flow around the leading edge of wings and empennage. It is also the larger droplets which produce clear or glaze ice which is well recognized as the ice form of most concern and is often also the most difficult to detect visually.\nClouds and Supercooled Moisture\nThe majority of supercooled droplets in clouds are between 1 micron (0.001mm) and 50 microns (0.05 mm) in diameter. [For comparison, the thickness of the average human hair is approximately 100 microns]. Layer (stratiform) clouds typically contain average droplet diameters of up to 40 microns. Vertically developed (cumuliform) clouds of moderate scale typically have average droplet diameters of up to 50 microns (0.05mm) but large Cumulonimbus clouds often contain much more liquid water, including large quantities in droplets with diameters up to and beyond 100 microns (0.1mm).\nFreezing Rain and Freezing Drizzle\nPrecipitation droplets that are clear of cloud are much larger than those within cloud and, if they are supercooled, they are described as creating Freezing Drizzle where droplets have a diameter of between 50 and 500 microns (0.05mm and 0.5mm) and Freezing Rain where the droplets exceed 500 microns (0.5mm) in diameter. Freezing Rain often has much larger droplets of 2mm diameter or more, although if they get much beyond 6mm in diameter, they will tend to break up.\nFreezing rain below cloud forms when rain droplets are supercooled by passage through a layer of air which has a sub-zero temperature. Since air temperatures normally increase as altitude reduces, freezing rain implies the existence of an air temperature inversion. Such conditions can occur below an advancing warm front or a warm occlusion where a relatively warm air mass is overrunning colder air. The existence of freezing rain normally means that there will be warmer air (above 0°C273.15 K\n491.67 °R) above.\nThe smaller supercooled droplets of freezing drizzle can also form in this way but it is generally considered that they more commonly arise by a different process called the collision-coalescence process. When, through condensation, some droplets in a cloud grow to approximately 30 micrometers in diameter, they begin to settle, falling fast enough so that they collide with some smaller droplets. If the droplets then coalesce, a larger droplet is produced and this now has an even better chance of ‘capturing’ smaller droplets. Under favorable conditions, this process can produce drizzle-size drops in a supercooled cloud, usually near the top, where the largest droplets generally are found in any cloud. Data capture has varied but some studies have reported that freezing drizzle in non-convective clouds forms more than 80 percent of the time by the collision-coalescence process. So, importantly, when in freezing drizzle, it cannot be assumed that warmer air (above 0°C273.15 K\n491.67 °R) will exist above it.\nThe term ‘icing severity’ is essentially about the rate at which significant ice accretion occurs. The descriptions of supercooled water droplets so far have been in terms of their size. These comparative diameters are important - typical drizzle droplets have a diameter 10 times that of typical cloud droplets and typical rain droplets have a diameter 100 times that of typical cloud droplets. Size as described by diameter is, though, not what matters most in terms of the potential for ice accretion through impact. What really makes the difference is the volume (or mass) of water contained in a droplet since this is what controls the amount of water which will impact the aircraft and also how far aft of the airflow stagnation point ahead of a leading edge surface that droplets will strike the aircraft. This latter point is of considerable importance since large droplets may impact far beyond the leading edges in areas which are not anti iced or de iced and may also turn to ice as they are flowing aft in contact with the surface initially hit.\nIt is important to note that the volume of a droplet is not proportional to its diameter but to approximately the cube of half the diameter (i.e. the radius). Therefore, if 20 microns (0.02 mm) is taken as a typical diameter for a cloud droplet and 2000 micrometres (2mm) is taken as the typical diameter of a freezing rain droplet, then although the diameters of these droplets differ by a factor of only 100, their volume, and therefore their mass, differ by a factor which is of the order of 1,000,000.\nIt is this vastly greater mass of supercooled water droplets in freezing precipitation compared to those in cloud, even cumulonimbus cloud, which precludes any aircraft undertaking a significant period of sustained flight - and in most cases any flight - in freezing precipitation clear of cloud.\nDifferences between ambient and aircraft skin temperature\nThere are a number of factors which vary the propensity for ice to accrete on an aircraft:\n- When any aircraft moves through the air, the resultant kinetic hearting due to both compression at points of air obstruction and friction at surfaces of air passage raises the aircraft skin temperature above that of the ambient air in the vicinity. The extent to which this occurs, and therefore the extent of its significance to ice formation, has been calculated to be directly proportional to the square of 1/100 x the true airspeed in knots. Pilots will be aware of the consequent difference between SAT and TAT which can be observed to increase with speed since the effect of TAS increase is greater than the opposite effect of air density decrease.\n- If an aircraft is climbing into colder air and frozen or semi frozen deposits are resting on the upper surfaces of the wings or horizontal tailplane surfaces or in related flight control hinge gaps, the possibility exists that these deposits might freeze fully and attach to the airframe in situ. However, this will usually only be a significant problem if the climb is made concurrently into conditions likely to produce independently significant ice accretion.\n- When an aircraft is descending from high altitude, the increase in the structure surface temperature as the ambient air warms is likely to lag behind the ambient air temperature increase, especially in the case of wings used as fuel tanks which still contain a significant quantity of fuel. This will particularly apply where fuel is ‘tankered’ for use on the next flight sector in preference to uplifting at the initial destination. The significance of fuel is its tendency for temperature to recover from prior cold soak more slowly than the structure containing it. One particular effect of this is the formation of ‘fuel ice’ on the lower surface of a wing because this is where the cold fuel is in direct contact with the wing structure. Such clear ice is often still present during the subsequent turnaround even when OAT is several degrees above freezing.\nEngine Air Inlet Icing\nAll aircraft certificated for flight in icing conditions are fitted with anti-icing systems. These prevent air intake lip and guide vane ice formation by use of electrically heated mats, circulated hot engine oil or bleed air extracted from the engine. However, further inside an air inlet, ice can form in unprotected areas even when an aircraft is not flying in icing conditions as presently defined for engine certification purposes. There are two such circumstances: the cooling of moist air above freezing temperature by pressure reduction in piston engines; and the melting of ice crystals which are warmed after entering turbine engines.\nIn the first case, moist air entering a piston engine intake at a temperature above 0°C273.15 K\n491.67 °R is then accelerated by a suction effect through a reduced channel. This ‘venturi’ effect reduces its temperature causing the moisture load to condense out and be precipitated on the walls of the air channel as ice. See Piston Engine Induction Icing for more detail. This article also describes two other types of induction icing which occur in piston engines.\nIn the second case, high densities of very small ice crystals in very cold, high altitude air are ingested into high bypass gas turbines. They then either temporarily freeze and detach as larger pieces of ice causing engine airflow disruption, or cause mechanical damage either as pieces of ice or via discrete throughputs of liquid water. For further information, refer to High Level Ice Crystal Icing: Effects on Engines.\nThere are no definitions for absolute icing severity in aviation forecasting. However, the relative qualifications light, moderate and severe are generally used (in respect of airframe icing risk only) in a way which has at least reasonable consistency regionally in the context of the type of forecast in which they are used. It is understood by most forecasters that a term like ‘light icing’ will be interpreted rather differently by a commercial transport flight crew and a private pilot wondering whether they are likely to be able to undertake their planned flight clear of all icing conditions. As a consequence, low level icing forecasts are usually presented in such a way that they are specifically accessible to pilots of light aircraft vulnerable to the effects of any icing. However, the forecasts provided primarily for commercial air transport will use moderate and severe icing in terms which reflect their likely significance to aircraft which are certificated for routine flight in ‘icing conditions’ because they are equipped with appropriate ice protection systems. This use of higher level forecast presentations by general aviation can produce misunderstandings about the icing conditions that might be expected, and sometimes lead to inappropriate flight planning. The point is that the relative forecasts of icing severity cannot and do not take account of their user and the aircraft they are flying, so the interpretation of forecasts is as much a matter of judgement as monitoring the apparent icing reality once in the air.\nWith all the above caveats, a brief look at the usual ‘descriptions’ and ‘definitions’ of icing conditions used by forecasters may still be helpful. The descriptions all assume that an aircraft is certificated for “flight in icing conditions”.\n- Light Icing is often described as conditions such that ‘no change of course or altitude is necessary and no loss of airspeed occurs. It has been more rigorously defined by some as a rate of ice accretion per hour on outer wing of between 0.25 inch and 1 inch (0.6 to 2.5 cm).\n- Moderate Icing has been typically described as ice accretion which continues to increase but not at a rate sufficient to affect the safety of the flight unless it continues for an extended period of time, but air speed may be lost. A definition based upon an ice accretion rate per hour on the outer wing of 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.5 cm)\n- Severe Icing has been variously described as ice accretion:\n- in which either the icing rate or ice accumulation exceed the tolerance of the aircraft;\n- which continues to build and begins to seriously affect the performance and manoeuvrability of an aircraft;\n- at a rate such that ice protection systems fail to remove the accumulation of ice and ice accumulates in locations not normally prone to icing;\n- such that an immediate exit from the condition is necessary to retain full control of the aircraft.\nIt is generally accepted that, although aircraft certification for flight in icing conditions rarely includes any stated restrictions, no aircraft is approved for flight in severe icing conditions, and that severe icing conditions may occur at any ice accumulation rate.\nIn North America, the terms clear, rime or mixed are more often used in forecast material than elsewhere and are both intended and taken as a proxy for droplet size regardless of other factors such as temperature and liquid water content. In this use, a forecast of rime icing indicates smaller drop sizes and a forecast of mixed or clear icing indicates larger drop sizes but with only a vague and undefined boundary between the two.\nFinally, a “clean aircraft” at rotation is an essential requirement for flight in or into icing conditions for those aircraft so approved. It is achieved by the use of appropriate ground de-icing or anti-icing fluids which have a sufficient holdover time for the prevailing conditions. Anti Icing is nearly always achieved by thickened fluids which adhere to the airframe and then progressively shear off during the take off roll so that they have all been shed by 100KIAS. There is no approved fluid protection against freezing rain or freezing drizzle conditions and so departure in them is generally not possible.\n- In-Flight Icing\n- Icing - Collection Efficiency\n- Aircraft and In Flight Icing Risks\n- Piston Engine Induction Icing\n- Freezing Rain\n- Aircraft Ground De/Anti Icing\n- Ice Protection Systems\n- High Level Ice Crystal Icing: Effects on Engines\n- Extract from Transport Canada Aviation Safety Letter 1/2007: The Adverse Aerodynamic Effects of Inflight Icing on Airplane Operation\n- Aircraft Icing Handbook, Version 1 by Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand\n- Appendix C 'Icing Conditions' to CFR 14 Part 25, FAA, 2014"", 'Safety while flying elicits a lot of attention from all those who venture to fly. As much as statistics show that travelling by cars is more dangerous than aircrafts, flying is more feared due the loss of control that people feel as a result of being suspended in the air. Many regulatory bodies look at aviation safety seriously as much as passengers. These bodies are tasked with the enforcement of rules and standards that address safety of the passengers while on board a moving aircraft from liftoff up to landing.\nThe aviation industry is one of the most highly regulated. All players from the manufacturers of the giant jumbos to the suppliers of the smallest parts are required to adhere to a wide range of standards. Each part that is made is tested so as to verify whether it is compliant with predetermined tolerance limits failure to which it must be done away with. There are approved third parties who are empowered to certify companies that engaged in the aircraft industry (Krause, 2003).\nAll companies that are involved in air travel are closely monitored to ensure they are competent. This is not only expected of manufacturers of parts but also those companies that assemble aircrafts. After the assembly every plane is tested so as to ascertain whether it complies with regulatory requirements. The tests include flying so as to establish whether it is operating properly and safely (Krause, 2003).\nDuring a test flight only a small portion of the crew is taken on board. New models are examined through a battery of tests that are designed to simulate real flight conditions. This process can take over a year to be completed. Production runs of a particular model are also subjected to lesser demanding tests but test flights are always conducted on every produced unit. Regulations are also enforced when a plane is in service. Actually, the rules become stricter through a schedule of maintenance and inspections before every flight (Stolzer & Goglia, 2011).\nIf an aircraft deviates from a set-out schedule it may be grounded. Every busy plane is usually inspected for more than one occasion every day. Those that fly occasionally are inspected after a few days or weekly. If a plane fails an inspection it is immediately grounded until all required repairs are completed. Minor maintenance procedures are done at least one time a month or after a few days. On the other hand major maintenance is done as required or at least one time after every two months. The regulations that govern how safe aircrafts are also applied to the crew.\nAs far as the crew is concerned, the major bone of contention is the number of crew members that are included in each flight as well as how experienced they are and for how long that they have flown. This is extended to how much sleep pilots have before entering into a cockpit every time. As much as most people worry about how safe they are aboard an aircraft is one of the safest activities that anyone can engage in (Krause, 2003). Rules and procedures are enforced so as to reduce the number of airborne accidents to the minimum by ensuring that all aircrafts are in proper working order at all times.\nEvery passenger who boards a plane always expects that it is well equipped with devices for utilization during an emergency situation. In many modern aircrafts such devices extend beyond procedures for ensuring that passengers are safe to warning systems that are designed to avoid accidents. These systems have to be correctly installed and constantly maintained (Stolzer & Goglia, 2011). Devices that are considered as basic for ensuring that each and every flight is safe are standards that must be adhered by each plane whether it is the smaller planes to the huge commercial jets. Large jets have a deployable slide that is used to evacuate passengers from the sides very quickly in case of an emergency. If such devices are not there, evacuation may not be feasible which portends that a jet would hit the ground while passengers are aboard which would lead to catastrophic results (Rodrigues & Wells, 2012).\nParachutes are a primary requirement in the smaller aircrafts. This device is one of the foremost precautions that is available in every plane and should be maintained adequately to ensure that it is in proper working condition and it can be deployed without damaging the parachute. Parachutes are rarely used during an accident but they still remain an option that is considered seriously (Huang, 2009).\nThere are computerized equipments that are installed in aircrafts and calibrated to avoid occurrence of accidents altogether. These are recent developments and pilots consider them as important ways of controlling planes and helping them to understand problems as they develop during a flight, thereby giving them sufficient time to appropriately react.\nThe aircraft industry has seen the enforcement of so many standards that are geared towards ensuring that all flights are safe. Companies have to hire highly experienced personnel to fly and manage their planes. Such personnel should have an established record of safety as well as in implementation of best practices. One of the most basic ways of ensuring that a plane flies and lands without interruption is that every cockpit must have two pilots just in case one of them becomes deactivated during a flight.\nStatistically the number of aircraft accidents is low as a result of developments that have enhanced the performance of aircraft through superior engine design as well as adequate training of pilots which are deemed to be the focal points of ensuring that each plane lifts off and lands without any incidences. International organizations that govern manufacture and management of aircrafts always recommend that all national authorities should implement safety regulations.\nSince the advent of flying planes have crashed leading to very serious results. This is a result of the flight nature which is unforgiving as a small medium is suspended in air to support a large mass whose failure does not give an option but quick descent with catastrophic eventualities (Stolzer & Goglia, 2011). Due to this planes are designed with an emphasis of reducing the chances of mechanical malfunctions and pilots are intensively trained.\nIn the earlier developments in aircraft technology there were those who have been of the view that a plane should be designed with consideration of how it would endure an accident. However, such a design would lead to the manufacture of the very heavy model that would be more susceptible to crash as a result of the added weight. As a result of this it is not uncommon to find the nonstructural parts of planes, especially the small ones are very light and when such planes crash devastating results follow.\nFlying in private jets is more dangerous in comparison to the scheduled flights. This is partly attributable to less maintenance and training. In most cases privately owned aircrafts do not have system redundancy to be utilized if a system failure occurs. Therefore it can be presupposed that it is safer to fly using commercial airlines (Rodrigues & Wells, 2012).\nAir traffic can be considered to be intense as there are usually ten thousand planes in flight at the same time. Despite this accidents are rarely sighted given the high number of operations. Statistically flying by scheduled airlines in the developed world is at least ten times safer than driving. However, this is not the case in many African nations and Russia. Plane accidents make headlines throughout the world when they occur (Rodrigues & Wells, 2012). The perceived impact of such accidents has magnifying effect. The main reasons that lead to the airborne accidents are flaws in the design, pilot’s errors and improper maintenance procedures.\nThere are inspectors whose sole mandate is to ensure that regulations regarding performance and quality of aircraft including personnel are adhered to. These professionals are specialized in the inspection of either single or multiple engine aircrafts or commercial carriers. Other inspectors perform inspections on the operation of airlines where they evaluate commercial carriers as well as air operations. In addition inspectors also certify flight instructors, pilots as well as ensure verification of flight training facilities and programs.\nThe aeronautical profession is very dynamic and highly technical. There are numerous technologies that emerge with a view to improve travelling through airborne means. Every flight implies that many lives are at stake at any one time which places a very high demand on the crew and pilots to be highly trained and constantly updated with new developments (Rodrigues & Wells, 2012).\nThe training of pilots must be very intensive so as to ensure that the passengers aboard their aircraft are safe. Prior to being allowed to fly an actual aircraft an aviator is required to hone his skills using simulators that emulate real flight conditions. This is intended to prepare the pilots to deal with many types of scenarios that may present themselves while in flight mode. A pilot is certified after amassing a certain number of flight hours.\nPilot trainers are also constantly put to speed with every new development so that they pass on the knowledge to their students. Aircraft mechanics and engineers are also required to be equally competent as pilots and are held responsible in case a plane develops mechanical problems while in flight (Huang, 2009). This is intended to ensure that they carefully do their work so as to prevent aircraft accidents that usually cause multiple deaths.\nPlanes do not fly a lot during winter. However, the importance of proper winterizing a plane should not be understated as it is a matter of safe flying as well as enhancing the useful life of an aircraft. Manuals usually spell out how a plane should be winterized. One basic thing that should be done is to cover the canopy, windows, prop blades and the horizontal tail as these are the most crucial external parts. Covering reduces damage that is caused by snow, ice, rain and cold which are experienced during winter.\nIn order to enhance the welfare of all passengers it is important for a pilot to be very observant about pressure and oil temperature while flying in cold conditions as such features oscillate significantly when in flight as well as while not in flight. Repairs should be immediately done in case an oil cooler bypass occurs (Stolzer & Goglia, 2011).\nOne of the most basic things to do so as to ensure that flight is completed successfully is checking that the fuel tank is full and that the valves are properly closed. Emptiness in the fuel tank of a plane leads to condensation during winter which may cause corrosion that leads to complications during flight. When flying during cold weather, a pilot should establish whether his plane requires the use of isopropyl alcohol that is added to the fuel while operating in low temperatures.\nMany regulations in aircraft management are usually precipitated by catastrophic events. Such rules have gone long way in preventing other air disasters. The ability of a pilot is one of the most crucial factors during the occurrence of accidents. Pilots are properly evaluated so as to ensure that accidents do not occur as a result of easily avoidable things like fatigue. Aviation safety will continue to be an important matter for all national and international air travel regulators. This will ensure that travelling by air continues to be the safest mode of transport in comparison with others like motor vehicle transportation (Huang, 2009).']"	['<urn:uuid:feb0abc0-d768-40b0-ab94-269ded9eeac1>', '<urn:uuid:a11a4a5c-c4dd-4710-a236-e71f5f39cb79>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-01T22:47:46.423955	17	68	4621
935	non hiking access methods machu picchu peak	Visitors who prefer not to hike can access Machu Picchu through multiple convenient options. They can take a train from Cusco to Aguas Calientes, followed by a 30-minute bus ride to reach the citadel. The Belmond Hiram Bingham train specifically caters to those who want to visit the UNESCO World Heritage Site without undergoing too much physical activity.	"['Culture & Living\nFrom the Island Express, which takes you to the southernmost point of India, to the Jacobite Steam Train that leads you right into Harry Potter universe, these are some of the most beautiful train journeys you can take\nThere’s something so very special about train journeys—they’re reminiscent of simpler times, and the perfect companion for unhurried holidays. Train rides are for reading, playing board games with the entire family and, most importantly, stumbling upon small junctions and quaint towns that you’d never even heard of before. The more romantic way to travel, trains allow its passengers to watch the world go by and really savour the journey.\nIf you’d like to relive the joy that train rides bring, we’ve curated a list of 10 stellar experiences you can hop on board for. From passing by the Grand Canyon to travelling across Russia from east to west, these are the some of the most scenic train journeys you can take.\nBuilt between 1879 and 1881, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (or the Toy Train, as it is known) is a two-feet gauge railway running between New Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling in West Bengal. Passing through snow-capped mountains, verdant forest, tea plantations and villages, it’s one of the most scenic experiences you can undertake. The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was first declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999. Today, the accreditation is also extended to include the Nilgiri Mountain Railway and the Kalka Shimla Railway—the three are called Mountain Railways of India together, and are a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nWith a round trip that covers 210km, the Grand Canyon Railway offers breathtaking views of the iconic national park in the US. Opened in 1901, the restored rail cars feature different classes of service. The train departs from Williams, Arizona, and passes through a wide variety of landscapes—including Ponderosa and Pinion pine forests, the prairie, and the highest elevation in Arizona, San Francisco Peaks—before reaching the Grand Canyon National Park.\nMake sure to book a window seat on the Glacier Express for unparalleled views. The route goes through three cantons of Switzerland—Valais, Uri and Graubünde, starting from St Moritz and coming to an end in Zermatt. The entire journey takes eight hours to complete, crosses 291 bridges and 91 tunnels, and reaches a highest elevation of 2,033m .\nEver thought about witnessing the scenery of southern British Columbia from the comfort of a luxurious carriage? Thanks to the Rocky Mountaineer’s First Passage to the West, it’s possible. The route starts at Vancouver and concludes at Banff, and provides panoramic views at every interval, including the Fraser Canyon’s Hell’s Gate and the Canadian Rockies.\nBeginning at Christchurch, the TranzAlpine takes you through the fertile fields of the Canterbury Plains before going up the mountains to pass by Staircase Viaduct, and crossing the beautiful snow-capped mountains of Arthur’s Pass National Park. The journey continues through sub-tropical rainforests with the last stop being the historic former gold-mining town, Greymouth.\nOne of the world’s longest train journeys, the Trans-Siberian is an eight-day journey covering almost 9,290km. It begins at the westward terminus in Moscow and takes you across the country all the way to Vladivostok in the east. On this journey, you will be going travelling through Ural Mountains, the Siberian forest and the magnificent Lake Baikal, the world’s oldest freshwater lake that was formed 25 million years ago.\nSouth Africa is known for breathtaking landscapes, so of course we had to add a train journey through the country to this list. The Rovos Rail’s Namibia Safari departs from Pretoria and goes through Kimberly (home to the Big Hole, one of the world’s largest hand-dug mines), crossing the Northern Cape, the Fish River Canyon and Namibia, before coming to a stop at the coastal city of Swakopmund.\nThough some of you might want to climb Machu Picchu, the Belmond Hiram Bingham is great for those who want to visit the UNESCO World Heritage Site without undergoing too much physical activity. The journey begins in the ancient capital city of Cusco and passes through the Sacred Valley of the Incas, as well as a tiny village called Ollantaytambo. The final destination is obviously the cherry on the cake—Machu Picchu, the ancient Inca citadel set high in the Andes Mountains.\nDescribed as one of the greatest railway journeys in the world, the Jacobite Steam Train’s route from Edinburgh to the Highlands at Fort William passes the deepest seawater loch in Europe, Loch Nevis, the highest mountain in Britain, Ben Nevis, and the deepest freshwater body in the British Isles, Loch Morar. On the bucket list of true Harry Potter fans, the train journey retraces the 135km journey that the boy wizard takes to reach Hogwarts at the start of every school year. While you may not actually make it in time for Dumbledore’s welcome address, you’re still guaranteed a pretty magical train ride.\nZipping past beautiful villages, plantations and lush countryside, The Island Express takes you through the picturesque landscape of south India over a 19-hour journey. Train No 16526 goes from Bengaluru to Kanyakumari (the southernmost point of India), and offers stunning views of the Pamban Bridge, which held the title of India’s longest bridge until the Bandra-Worli Sea Link in Mumbai became operational. Meanwhile, Train 16525, which runs in the reverse direction, journeys through Kerala, taking you through Kottayam, Trivandrum and Palakkad.', ""ESSAY MACHU PICCHU\nTourists from all around the world -- many ready for some serious high altitude hiking -- flock to the mysterious ruins of Machu Picchu. Hidden nearly 8,000 feet above sea level in the Andes Mountains of Peru, the ancient Inca city remained lost to modern civilization until 1911. Although its purpose and place in the Inca culture remain a mystery, the accomplishments of its builders and the beauty of its surrounding make Machu Picchu one of South America's top archeological and tourist destinations.\nArriving by train from Cusco\nAdventurers begin their journey in the Incan capital city of Cusco, (more than a 24-hour drive or about an hour flight from Lima), where they board a train for the 4-hour trip through the Andes to Aguas Calientes. The final ascent to the top of the 500-meter cliff,\nwhere Machu Picchu overlooks the Urubamba River canyon, can be completed by a 30-minute bus ride. More adventurous travelers can forgo the bus and hike up the Inca trail to the citadel.\nThose who choose to hike the mountain follow the trail established by the original Inca inhabitants of the Sacred Valley below Machu Picchu. The trail -- made entirely of fitted stone rocks -- served as a trade and communication link between Incan strongholds. With\nmost of the original stones gone, today's trail is a dirt path with intermittent steps and stone areas. The trip up the mountain can take from one to five days. For the longer treks, hikers disembark at kilometer 88 in the town of Qorihuayrachina. One-day hikers depart at\nkilometer 104 at the Incan ruin of Chalcabamba.\nThe mystery of Machu Picchu\nOnce at the summit, a day pass to the city allows visitors to explore the ruins on their own or with a tour guide. The entire site, which covers about five square miles and is more than 500 years old, contains homes, irrigation channels and farming terraces. The Incas' unusual building technique of precisely joining stone blocks without cement or mortar has\nimpressed scholars since Hiram Bingham, an archaeologist from Yale University who discovered the ruins in 1911. The Incas also used complex mathematics to study astronomy and lay out the site, though the city's place in Inca society and the fate of its inhabitants remains a mystery.\nTaking walking trips from the city site -- no matter how visitors reach the peak -- is a popular way to explore more about Incan culture. The well-preserved ruins at Huinay Huayna, left, -- approximately a 4-hour hike from Machu Picchu -- provide an example of the farming terraces the Incas used to cultivate crops.\nThe Sun Gate\nHikers without the time or energy for a 4-hour trek have many options for shorter trips. A popular 1-hour hike takes adventurers along the well-preserved road from Machu Picchu to Intipunku, the Sun Gate. The gate originally served as the entrance to the city from the Inca trail.\nAnother option is a hike up to Huayna Picchu, the skyward peak behind the ruins. This challenging trek takes an average of one and a half hours. But the view is worth the walk. The peak of Huayna Picchu has a postcard-perfect view, shown left, of the entire lost city nestled beneath the towering Andes.\nCopyright © A. L.

499	What's the difference between getting a regular parking ticket and a serious traffic violation, and how can someone deal with the mental pressure of each situation?	A parking infraction notice is generally less serious and can be resolved by simply paying the ticket, which is essentially pleading guilty, or contesting it by requesting a trial date. However, a serious traffic violation results in a summons that requires mandatory court appearance and could lead to criminal penalties like license suspension, fines, or jail time. To manage the mental pressure of these situations, several strategies can help. For temporary stress, exercising, listening to relaxing music, doing hobbies, and surrounding yourself with supportive people can be beneficial. For longer-term stress, techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, and mindfulness can help calm both body and mind. It's also important to manage automatic negative thinking through self-compassion and reducing perfectionism, as these approaches can help reduce anxiety and worry about the situation.	"['Wondering what is a traffic summons?\nYou received a court summons for speeding or traffic violation laws and are looking to find out what it entails.\nWhat’s a summons from a police and what’s the consequence?\nIn this article, we go over the traffic summons in detail so you know all there is to know about it.\nLet’s dive right in.\nTable of Contents\nWhat is a traffic summons\nA traffic summons is a summons issued by the police or a peace officer compelling someone to appear in court so his guilt or innocence can be determined on a charge.\nIf you received a traffic summons, your court presence is mandatory.\nIt also means that the traffic offense for which you are summoned to court is of relative importance requiring you to appear in court and defend your case in front of a judge.\nYou cannot just ignore the traffic summons, you need to make sure you appear in court.\nWhat’s a summons from a police\nSummons or citations are issued by the police when there is a traffic violation or behaviour that can constitute a crime.\nWhen someone is caught in violation of the traffic laws or criminal laws while driving, the police will write a citation against the person to appear in court.\nOften, the citation is issued directly on the scene at the moment the police noticed and apprehended you for traffic violations.\nWhat is a court summons for speeding\nA speeding summons is a traffic summons issued as a result of a speeding offense.\nIf a speeding summons has been issued to someone, they will need to appear in court and answer to the speeding charges outlined in the speeding ticket summons.\nIf the court finds the person innocent, the speeding summons will be dismissed.\nIf the court finds the person guilty of the speeding offense, then the court will define the appropriate penalty and sanctions to issue to the person charged with speeding.\nTherefore, a court summons for speeding ticket is issued only when speeding was at issue and required that you appear in court.\nTypes of traffic tickets\nDepending on your jurisdiction, you may have different types of summons for traffic violations.\nYou can get any of the following:\n- Parking infraction notice\n- Offense notice\nParking infraction notice\nA parking infraction notice is generally not that serious and you’ve probably got many of them.\nWith the parking infraction notice, the owner of a car is informed that they parked in a prohibited place.\nBy paying the parking ticket, you are essentially pleading guilty and resolving the ticket.\nYou can also contest the parking ticket and ask for a trial date to dispute the ticket.\nWhen you get an offense notice, this means that you have been in violation of traffic laws going from minor severity to major one.\nYou can receive an offense notice for speeding, missing a stop sign or driving through a red light.\nA summons is issued for serious offenses with criminal consequences.\nWhen you are issued a traffic summons, you are asked to appear in court to answer to the accusations made against you.\nYou can face sanctions such as the suspension of your driver’s license, fine and even jail.\nYou must make sure you give the summons issued to you all the importance it deserves as you can end up with a criminal record.\nWhat is contained in the traffic summons\nIf you have received a citation to appear from a police officer, it must contain some important information.\nYou should have the name of the court where you are asked to appear along with the court’s address.\nYou should also find an indication as to when is your initial court appearance date and time.\nGenerally, you should also find some information about the offense you’ve been charged with as well.\nAre you guilty when the traffic summons is issued\nIt’s important to note that you are not necessarily guilty because of the fact that a traffic summons was issued to you.\nA police officer who issued the summons to you had reasons to believe that you committed a violation of the traffic laws or criminal laws.\nThe police provided you with the summons so you have the opportunity to answer the charges laid against you before a judge.\nWhen the court will ultimately hear your case, the judge will make the final decision on your level of guilt.\nThe judge can either dismiss the traffic charges or find you guilty.\nConsequences of ignoring a court summons for speeding\nA speeding summons, just like any other type of summons, is an important legal document.\nYou are asked to present yourself to court so it can be determined if you should be held responsible for the traffic violation or not.\nRemember, some traffic violations can result in criminal penalties such as:\n- Careless driving\n- Reckless driving\n- Driving under the influence of alcohol\n- Driving under the influence of drugs\n- Crash causing material or bodily harm\n- Street racing\nIf you do not show up to court on the date required, the court may issue an arrest warrant against you.\nThe warrant for your arrest is a mandate given to the police to find you and detain you until you appear in front of a judge to answer the charges laid against you.\nThis also called a “bench summons” as the judge sitting on the bench issues the summons commanding the police to find and arrest the offender.\nNot respecting a traffic summons can be significant.\nA parking summons, or a non-moving violation, does not force you to appear in court unless you elect to contest the traffic ticket.\nIf your parking ticket has a parking summons date, you can fully resolve it by paying the ticket before the court appearance date.\nIn some jurisdictions, the parking ticket will not have a traffic fine summons and will rather ask you to either pay the ticket, and acknowledge you were guilty, or send a written request to contest it.\nIf you send a written request, then you’ll receive a summons to appear in court and contest the traffic ticket.\nYou received a summons for a traffic ticket and now you must appear in court.\nHow serious is this?\nThe summons to court for speeding, traffic law violation or even the violation of the criminal laws can be serious.\nYou should read the traffic summons carefully to understand when you are asked to appear in court and what are the charges laid against you.\nThe mere issuance of a court summons does not mean that you are guilty of the charges outlined in it.\nYou have the opportunity to go to court and contest the charges.\nIf you are not sure how deal with the summons, you should contact a lawyer experienced in the field to give you guidance.\nWe hope this article helped you better understand what is a traffic summons.\nWe would love to hear your feedback on this article.\nDrop us a comment!', 'Stress and Anxiety Management Skills\nWhat is Stress and Anxiety?\nThe first step in managing stress is to understand it. Although the terms stress, worry, and anxiety are used interchangeably by many people, they do have differences.\nStress involves reacting mentally and physically to a specific experience in your daily life, such as moving away from home, final exams, or lack of money to pay bills that month. After taking action or the stress passes, a normal mood returns. Even positive events such as winning an award or getting married can be temporarily stressful. It is important to recognize that not all stress is bad. A good type of stress, called eustress, keeps people motivated and excited about life. It can enhance an individual\'s performance in studying for an academic exam, or competing in an athletic event, or dealing with a difficult interpersonal situation.\nWorry is a form of thinking involving apprehensive expectations. It can be constructive when it leads to a positive solution, but it can become toxic when it paralyzes an individual. Key components of excessive worry are that it is non-productive and repetitive. Individuals may think about a problem over and over again as though running in place on a treadmill, going nowhere, but may never jump off the treadmill to resolve the problem.\nAnxiety, on the other hand, is what happens when stress continues without the stressor. In the brain, it is most closely related to fear and feelings of impending doom. It tends to be chronic involving excessive worrying about vague fears such as harm to loved ones, being unsuccessful in life, or fear of the future. Individuals may also worry about many small things that are not worth worrying about. If it does not go away, it may become chronic. Stress is not a psychiatric condition, but when pervasive stress and worry continue for over 6 months, it can become an anxiety disorder.\nThe anxiety disorders are the most common mental health problem in America. In any given year, anxiety affects about 18.1 percent of U.S. adults, and many more U.S. adults will experience it across their lifespan. New and better ways to handle both stress and worry before they become long-term problems are essential. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has succinct and helpful publications on the five major types of anxiety disorders. The Stress Recess site below has an excellent interactive program about stress and anxiety.\nCommon Responses to Stress and Anxiety\nStress affects each of us differently. Below are some common responses to stress and anxiety.\n- Feelings: worry; guilt; embarrassment; irritability; anger; fear; moodiness; feeling overwhelmed.\n- Thoughts : poor concentration; self-criticism; perfectionism; difficulty making decisions; forgetfulness; repetitive negative thoughts; fear of failing; worrying about the future.\n- Behaviors: acting impulsively; being irritable with others; using drugs, alcohol, or smoking to excess; crying; avoiding people or places.\n- Symptoms: tight muscles in neck, shoulders, and face; stomach distress; fatigue; trembling; appetite and sleep problems; dry mouth; heart pounding; sweating.\nTips for Managing Your Temporary Stress\nStress management is a personal journey. What works for one person may not work for another. As you try different approaches, it is important to allow your body and mind to tell you what is working for you.\nFor brief periods of stress, you may find the following helpful in reducing stress: exercising; listening to relaxing music; taking a warm bath or shower; doing hobbies and creative projects; managing your time better; surrounding yourself with supportive family and friends; getting your feelings out; laughing; and focusing on the positive.\nTips for Managing Your Longer-Term Stress and Anxiety\nOver time you may find you need additional tension reducing exercises. These are the state-of-the- art therapeutic approaches for reducing both stress and anxiety. They can be helpful when performed on a daily basis for a few minutes, as well as utilized in the middle of a stressful experience. They can lead your body and mind to calm down. They may also lead you to be less reactive to stress within a few weeks. (See the Virtual Relaxation Room on this site for downloadable exercises for most of these strategies).\n- Deep Breathing: The most basic relaxation exercise is slow, rhythmic breathing from your abdomen to calm yourself. When you are stressed or worried, your breathing tends to be shallow and fast. When your breathing is deep and slow, you tend to relax at a physiological level.\n- Progressive Muscle Relaxation: By alternately tensing and relaxing the major muscle groups throughout the body, you can achieve a deep sense of relaxation. After practicing this for several weeks, you may be able to move on to a ""Body Scan"" exercise where you notice the tension in the muscles but do not need to tense them.\n- Visualization or Guided Imagery: Imagery is a powerful way of achieving relaxation. By being transported to a soothing scene, you are free to let go of all tension and anxiety. You employ your visual sense but also your senses of taste, smell, touch, and sound.\n- Mindfulness of Thinking: Mindfulness is remaining aware of your feelings and thoughts in the here-and-now moment while suspending judgment or evaluation of yourself and your experience. By staying calm and focused without judgment, you can soothe and quiet yourself.\n- Meditation: Meditation is a proven method for relaxation of the mind and body. Meditation can bring you into the present by focusing your attention on your breathing, a few repeated words, a single repetitive action, or the flickering light from a candle. Many different types of meditation exist, so you need to do research to pick the one best for you.\nTips for Managing Your Automatic and Negative Thinking\nThese approaches are very helpful for changing the automatic and distorted negative thinking that can lead to long-term worry and anxiety. (See the Virtual Relaxation Room on this site for self-compassion exercises and the Stress Recess resources below for an explanation of the role of cognitions and beliefs in causing anxiety)\n- Self-Compassion: Self-compassion is the way to achieve well-being and relaxation through responding to yourself with kindness and understanding when you struggle with feelings of inadequacy, embarrassment, and other negative feelings. Self-compassion reduces the negative feelings caused from being relentlessly self-critical and may even lead to improved performance. This approach uses meditation and positive affirmations.\n- Reducing Perfectionism: By setting impossible goals and failing to meet these goals, you may end up with feelings of guilt, anxiety, disappointment, and lowered self-esteem. Frequently, you may set a new unrealistic goal because you believe achieving it will blot out the original sense of failure. More failure is usually the outcome. Reducing Perfectionism and substituting Healthy Striving is crucial to improving the sense of self and achieving personal peace.\nStress and Anxiety Management\nIf you want to learn more about stress and anxiety management skills, you may find additional information at the following links:\n- Anxiety and Self-Esteem (UT/Austin)\n- More Tips for Managing Stress (UT/Austin)\n- Publications about Anxiety Disorders (NIMH)\n- Stress Recess, (UT/Austin)\n- Vicious Cycle of Perfectionism vs. Healthy Striving (Stress Recess)\n- Cognitive Distortions (Stress Recess)\nIf you are struggling with stress, worrying, or anxiety and need more than the exercises above, help is available.

885	difference between large and small diaphragm condenser microphones frequency response high end	Small diaphragm condensers (1-1.5cm) have superior wide frequency response, especially in high frequencies. Large diaphragm condensers have less even high frequency response with frequencies dropping off beyond 10kHz, though manufacturers often add HF boost extending down to 2kHz.	['If you already own a selection of mics, or you’ve been able to borrow some mics off friends then you will already be on the right path to keeping your costs down for running a cheap multitrack recording session. The mics that you have will probably include some dynamic mics and maybe a few others, which are most likely to be condenser mics. There are other types of mics you might come across of course such as contact mics and boundary mics, but these are much more specialised and are unlikely to be sitting in the back of a mate’s cupboard. They are easy to recognise because they don’t often look like conventional microphones. You might be lucky and come across some ribbon mics, but the chances are slim so we’ll cover those in a later post when we look at buying new mics.\nSo, back to condensers and a quick overview of how they operate;\nA condenser mic works by sound waves changing the air pressure immediately next to the diaphragm, causing it to move a small amount. The diaphragm is placed very close to a metal backplate and a DC voltage is applied across the two (which is why they require phantom power). The diaphragm and backplate become the two plates of a capacitor. As the diaphragm is moved further away from or closer to the backplate, the capacitance changes and a current flows that is proportional to the movement of the diaphragm. Hey presto, you’ve got a condenser capsule!\nThis is a much more delicate arrangement than the capsule you will find in a dynamic microphone, and so they need to be treated with care. If you drop it and the two plates are knocked or moved, then that’s probably the end of the capsule, whereas if you just drop an SM58 (which I’m not advising) the grill might dent but should still work fine!\nCondenser mics generally come in two different flavours; those with large diaphragms and those with small diaphragms. I’m not going to go into great detail as to how the technical differences between the two affect their response, because DPA have already written an excellent page with all the info on it here that would take some doing to surpass.\nSmall Diaphragm Condensers\nThese tend to have a diaphragm diameter of maybe 1 to 1.5cm, and have a superb wide frequency response, in particular their hf response is generally better than large diaphragms. This is really useful when you want to pick up something with a lot of high frequency content like cymbals, so try them out as drum overheads! Generally they can handle higher sound levels too and have a good dynamic range, i.e. loud stuff = no problem. (see the DPA link above)\nTheir high frequency response makes them a very popular choice in the classical recording world, because without that nice flat top-end a recording can easily become dull-sounding. So if you are recording a piano or acoustic guitar, a small diaphragm will give you a nice crisp and bright high end.\nLarge Diaphragm Condensers\nThese typically have a less even high frequency response, as the physical size of the diaphragm means that high frequencies will ‘break up’ across the diaphragm rather than moving it all in one go, like a piston. So high frequencies usually drop off pretty quickly beyond about 10kHz. That might sound pretty high and maybe not worth considering, but to get the high top-end back, manufacturers often put in a little hf boost, which will extend down much lower than 10kHz, probably down to about 2kHz. This isn’t a bad thing, in fact it can be really useful on something like vocals to bring out the singer’s tone and can sound very flattering. They are also more sensitive than small diaphragm mics, and are less noisy i.e. very quiet stuff = nice and clean, again useful for things like vocals.\nMost large diaphragm condensers will come with a -10dB pad on them, because if they are subjected to high sound level they distort more easily than small diaphragms. So if you decide to try them out on something like drums then put the pad in. They are also more likely to have a switch-able directivity pattern, so you can for example put them in cardioid to reject some of the room if you want them on an acoustic guitar, or in omni if you want a nice deep low end on an upright bass.\nSo, once again, it would seem the key to getting the most out of the mics you have available, is to have a bit of an understanding of how they work and what they are likely to work well with, and of course a whole lot of experimentation. You will probably find that auditioning the mics before you use them to be a useful trick, more info on that with the page on dynamic microphones.\n[image via recordinghacks]']	['<urn:uuid:f239ae66-14eb-4143-9670-2cabdf14ef7f>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-01T23:55:16.606337	12	38	827
982	I love learning about traditional drinks - what's the main difference between how sake and sherry are aged, particularly the manzanilla type?	While manzanilla sherry undergoes a 'biological aging' process beneath a protective layer of yeast called flor, sake is more similar to beer in its production process, where starch is first converted to sugar and then to alcohol.	['Since the early years of the cocktail revival, bartenders have been re-discovering sherry—the central ingredient in many 19th-century classics from the flip to the cobbler—and praising it for its versatility. In San Francisco, 15 Romolo was among the first bars to embrace these fortified wines and, in the years since, has led the charge with its sherry-centric cocktail program, which calls on the full range of styles in a variety of different applications.\nThere’s one style of sherry, however, that the bar cites as being especially well-suited to mixing: manzanilla, the driest style of sherry, alongside fino. Manzanilla is primarily characterized by the flavors it develops during the “biological aging” process, as it matures beneath a protective layer of yeast known as flor. Typically a bit leaner and more saline than fino (which is essentially the same wine made in El Puerto de Santa María and Jerez de la Frontera, rather than Sanlúcar de Barrameda), manzanilla has the unique ability to bring perceived acidity and dryness to a cocktail. These two styles are among the world’s driest wines.\n“Manzanilla is an amazing wine because of its dryness and high acidity,” says 15 Romolo bar manager Andrew Meltzer, who fell in love with manzanilla about five years ago. What makes it such a standout ingredient in cocktails, he explains, is that it elevates other elements in the drink; the salinity of manzanilla can make flavors pop, much like “bringing a pinch of salt to the table.”\nThough he notes that it shines alongside both dark and light spirits in everything from shaken sours to stirred Martini riffs (like the 19th–century Bamboo or Tuxedo), Meltzer finds that manzanilla plays well with tequila, particularly in a drink like the Margarita. “It is the salt in a sour-style cocktail,” he says.\nBesides being an ideal complement to just about every spirit, manzanilla can easily take the place of a spirit in a drink built to be low-proof. But the best place to get to know how manzanilla behaves in a drink is to begin by subbing it for dry vermouth, says Meltzer, in “nearly any recipe.”\nManzanilla, Three Ways\n“Manzanilla is great in stirred drinks because it adds a mouth-watering quality,” explains Meltzer. In his Jabberwocky—adapted from the Jabberwock, which originally appeared in 1930’s The Savoy Cocktail Book—he combines manzanilla, gin and Lillet Blanc in equal parts for a delicate, floral drink.\nIn shaken drinks, manzanilla does particularly well as part of a split base—provided it’s used in a measure greater than one ounce, to prevent it from being overpowered by an accompanying spirit. “The benefit of doing a split base,” explains Meltzer, “is it allows manzanilla to shine hand-in-hand with whatever you’re pairing it with.” Here, Meltzer uses manzanilla to complement blanco tequila as the base of a sloe gin- and ginger-infused take on a classic sour.\n15 Romolo’s Sherry Cobbler\n“Manzanilla is risky in long drinks,” Meltzer cautions; given its low proof, it runs the risk of being over-diluted in a traditional Collins formula. However, bolstered by both amontillado and cream sherries, manzanilla holds up to a mound of crushed ice and fresh citrus in this take on the classic Sherry Cobbler.', 'A growing number of people are discovering and exploring Japanese sake nowadays. But in spite of its growing popularity, there is still more to this brew than meets the eye.\nHow much do you really know about sake? Scroll down and find out.\n1. Sake is Made from Rice\nThe rice used for making sake is a special variety called Saka Mai (Sake Rice).\nImage Credit:Nara Prefecture\nLeft: Sake Rice\nRight: Food Rice\nIts grain is larger in size than that of food rice. Its prominent white core is the most essential component of sake. To retrieve this white core, the rice is often polished. The more polished it is, the more delicious and delicate the taste becomes.\n2. It is More Like Beer than Wine\nSake is often referred to as rice wine because of its similarities in aroma and taste with wine. But as to fermentation process, it’s actually more like beer. Both beer and sake begin with starch, which is first converted to sugar, then to alcohol.\n3. Its Alcohol Content is Slightly Higher than Wine\nAt 15-16% alcohol by volume, sake is stronger than both beer and wine. At this level, its rich and strong aromas are best expressed, so sake is diluted from around 18%. But also, Japanese liquor tax applies lower tax to lower alcohol sake, and this pushes breweries to dilute sake, too.\n4. It can be Enjoyed Hot or Cold\nSake is best enjoyed at temperatures ranging from 40℉ (5℃) to 130℉ (55℃). But keep in mind that excessive heating may diminish its taste and delicateness. Conversely, heating at just the right temperature can intensify the aroma and savoriness of other types of sake.\n5. Ginjo Sake is Rare\nAmong the different types of sake, Ginjo-types have the highest quality. It uses highly polished rice, and takes long time for fermentation under strict temperature control. The resulting sake is very aromatic and has pure and clear taste. Ginjo comprises only 13% of the entire sake production volume in Japan. When you get to try one, it won’t disappoint you.\n6. Price is Quality\nThe price of sake is dependent on how polished the rice grains are. Sake rice can be expensive and a high rice polishing ratio is key to its quality. The general principle is the more expensive the sake, the more delicate and finer the taste.\n7. It goes well with various dishes\nMany think that they should consume sake with sushi or Japanese foods only. Sure, it might not go well with strong, spicy, or heavy dishes because they tend to be overpowering. But it’s not a bad idea at all to pair sake with common food items such as, pizza, cheese, and marinated seafood. Refer to the image above for our recommended food-sake pairings.\nKeep in mind that there is no rule in food-pairing, and you are free to combine as you wish.\n<Flavor of sake and possible pairings>\n8. Brewery Tours are Available\nSome sake breweries in Japan provide free tours, and they’re in English too. If you’re a sake fan and have an opportunity to visit Japan, there’s no reason why you should miss this.\nImage Credit:Ishikawa Brewery\n<Recommended sake brewery tours around Tokyo: >\nFree tours in English: Ishikawa shuzo*Ask for English tour in advance\nTours with a fee: Anchorman Inc.\nSake is gaining popularity both among enthusiasts and the general public. But there are still a few things about it most people don’t know yet.

1133	I'm fascinated by exotic fish breeding behaviors. What are the typical spawning patterns and egg development processes across different tropical fish species?	Oscar eggs are distinctive, having a cloudy off-white nearly tan color, unlike most cichlid eggs which are clear or light amber. The eggs hatch in 3-7 days depending on temperature. When they hatch, oscar fry initially appear as eyeless blobs with wiggling tails attached to slate by invisible threads. They take longer than most cichlids to absorb their yolk sacs and become free-swimming. In comparison, zebra angelfish lay around 1000 eggs on clean surfaces, with eggs hatching after 3-4 days. Their fry become free-swimming in about a week. For successful breeding of both species, specific conditions are needed - for zebra angelfish this includes maintaining pH around 6.5, water hardness of 5° dGH, and temperatures between 80-85°F. Both species' fry initially feed on baby brine shrimp.	['Oscars Chapter 5\nMisc Frogs II\nMisc Frogs III\nMisc Frogs IV\nMisc Frogs V\nPet World Visit\nGood looking fish with the start of a bad eye. He needs a water change now.\nNeeds Space. Oscars not only need elbow room, they will take it from their tank mates (by killing or eating them). This applies to other oscars in limited quarters. You can uncomfortably house a single in a 20-gallon tank. They really need 30+ gallons. Two adults will co-exist in a 55. They need a 70. Four can live in the 70, but expect lots of arguments.\nMr. Personality. New oscars pout. They lie on one side and look up at you with one untrusting eye. They’ll do the same if you redecorate their tank or move them to new quarters. When you net your oscar, expect to get a free shower. Some thrash so much they “foam” up their net. When you put him in the new tank, he’ll extend his hard rays and make it difficult for you to get him out of the net. Just like a freshly hooked bluegill. Don’t touch him unless absolutely necessary. His top and bottom fins are “stabbers.” You will find this out the first time you try to pick him up after he jumps out on the floor. Use a wet net, not your bare hands.\nNew Oscars. Resident oscars consider new oscars intruders invading their living room. The current occupant will try to evict the new tenant. The bigger the oscars, the bigger the fight (and the bigger the splash).\nLike to Argue. Oscars also fight because they feel good, want to breed, or just want a little exercise. Their French web site calls them “toujour agressif.” Very aggressive describes oscars quite aptly.\nFighting or Spawning? Oscars fight by slapping each other while facing head to tail. They also lock lips and wrestle each other and try to bite chunks out of each other. (Typical pre-spawning behavior also.) Expect these arguments. If they get too violent, put in a divider. Add NovAqua to “bandage” their wounds and abrasions.\nGood Fighters. Wild oscars in Florida escaped from flooded fish farm ponds or were released by fishermen who saw their fighting potential as a game fish. Their pugnacious natures make them a great fish to catch on hook and line. They put the “game” in game fish. They fight better than bass. They taste better, too.\nBig Bruisers. Oscars break heater tubes, power filter intakes, under gravel filter stems, and floating thermometers. Some they break by running into them accidentally. Others they break on purpose. They consider these items “oscar toys.” If you replace them, your oscar will probably break them again. Use suction cup holders to reduce breakage and figure out less superfragilistic ways to replace broken equipment. If you want to give them a toy, toss in a ping pong ball occasionally. Forget the paddles.\nDécor. Forget beautifully decorated planted aquaria like Amano-san constructs. Oscars rarely tolerate live plants. Use plastics. Weight the bottoms so they look normal when your oscars move them. (And they will.) Epoxy a gob of gravel on their base. Use the same gravel as their tank substrate. When they move them, the plants still look planted. Avoid rough rocks and sharp pieces of wood. Why ask for trouble? Arguing oscars can very easily injure themselves on sharp objects.\nGrowth Variation. If you start with equal-sized oscars, sometimes one grows faster. The big one gets most of the food and then grows even faster. Whip out your divider and separate them. Reduce the rations going into the large guy and give the extra to the little guy. He’ll catch up (usually). If you move one to a different tank, put the bigger guy in the smaller tank.\nPreventing Stunting. You’ve heard many people say “fish grow to the size of their tank.” You can stunt an oscar in a 10-gallon tank. But why put one of these potentially huge fishes in a little tank? Get a neon tetra. Okay, so you had no idea how big he’d get and he’s in your 10-gallon tank. How do you keep from stunting him? Stunting results from the waste products in the water – not from bouncing off the glass walls. Just change the water more often and/or make larger changes. You can grow a huge (and very uncomfortable) oscar in a 10-gallon tank, if you change enough of his water often enough. So reach under your mattress and extract enough of your tax refund to house him right. Or get him a home equity loan.\nBreeding Oscars. You won’t breed them in a 10. You need (minimum) a 55-gallon tank (70 gallons would be better). In fish farms they use a large diameter concrete pool two feet deep -- very similar to a kid’s wading pool in a public park, but with steep sides. They put in lots of large oscars and let them select their own mates. The breeder adds several large pieces of slate (some on the bottom, some leaning against the sides). The slates are checked frequently for spawns. Slates of eggs are removed and hatched artificially under controlled conditions. You can get bit walking thru these breeding ponds -- especially when extracting egg-filled slates.\nBreeding Tank. In your breeding tank partially bury a large slab of slate. Let them dig it out themselves. (If they spawn on the filter plate, the eggs and fry get sucked under.) Take out the eggs. Do it at night, if you fear oscar hickies. You will have better results rearing the eggs artificially.\nOscar Eggs. Put the slate in a well-filtered 10-gallon tank and add a slow bubbling airstone as their surrogate mama. Add methylene blue to taste (circa 2 ppm). Most cichlid eggs are clear or a light amber color. Oscar eggs are a cloudy off-white nearly tan color. As they develop, a line divides the eggs in half. They hatch in three to seven days depending upon temperature.\nHatched Eggs. Oscar eggs hatch into an eyeless blob with a wiggling tail attached to the slate by an unseen thread. They look nothing like oscars (or fish). As they absorb their yolk sacs, they lose their sticky thread and fall to the bottom in a sticky clump. Most cichlids absorb their yolk sacs fairly quickly and turn into hungry baby fishes. Oscars take much longer and grow into much larger and hungrier fry. Once they grow eyes and fins, they will start swimming (and eating). They cannot eat until they become free swimming.\nOscar Fry. Very small oscars sport a black line down their sides (typical of predator fishes who tend their young in schools). If you’ve ever seen a male largemouth bass tending his pit of fry, you’ve seen the obvious relationship between our North American centrarchids and the South American cichlids. Oscar fry eat newly hatched brine shrimp – lots of it and often. You will not believe how much they can eat. You will need to change their water often.\nOscar Babies. You find that 1,000 oscars eat mondo quantities of baby brine shrimp -- way past the glass tube quantity. Once they hit an inch or so, they lose their schooling line and develop a mottled pattern.

This makes them an excellent choice for beginner fish owners or people who don’t have time for a more high-maintenance companion.\nIn this article, we’ll go over everything you need to know about caring for zebra angelfish, including the best diet, habitat, and tank mates.\n|Scientific Name||Pomacanthus semicirculatus|\n|Minimum Tank Size||30 gallons|\n|size||10 inches (25 cm)|\n|Ease of Care||Moderate|\n|pH||6 – 7.4|\n|Temperature||79 – 83 degrees|\nZebra Angelfish Origins & Habitat\nZebra Angelfish (Pterophyllum scalare) is native to the Amazon River Basin, Orinoco Basin, and other tributaries of South America’s Guiana Shield.\nThey can be found in swamps and flooded regions with dense vegetation around clear or silty water in their natural environment.\nThese beautiful angels prefer marshes and underwater bushes, where they can swiftly hide. Also, they are a relatively calm, sociable species that may be observed congregating in large groups while swimming.\nWhat Are the Features of Zebra Angelfish?\nZebra angelfish have long, triangular dorsal and anal fins, a lengthy forked tail, a tiny mouth, and a spine positioned on the lower cheekbone.\nThe female zebra angelfish is light blue with a black band around her eyes and black vertical stripes on the top and bottom of her tail.\nHowever, the male zebra angelfish is pale blue with a zebra pattern of numerous thin, dark vertical lines.\nAlso, zebra angelfish species can be found in other hues, including:\n1. Silver Zebra Angelfish\nThey have dark brown or black longitudinal stripes and are generally black, gray, or silver body.\n2. Blue Zebra Angelfish\nThis fish has a blue body with a large striped pattern.\nZebra angelfish grow to a length of up to 10 inches (25 cm).\nIs Zebra AngelfishAngelfish Hardy?\nZebra angelfish (pterophyllum scalare) are relatively hardy and easy to keep and can tolerate a wide range of water conditions. This is one of the reasons why they are such a popular choice for aquariums.\nHow to Care for Zebra Angelfish?\n1. Water change\nAlthough they are hardy fish, high water quality is still essential for their health.\nYou should change at least 10-15% of the water in your aquarium every week. Also, make sure to remove any uneaten food or waste from the tank before doing a water change.\n2. Water Temperature\nThe Zebra Angelfish, like most South American cichlid species, prefers soft waters with a temperature range of 79 to 83 degrees Fahrenheit.\nBecause this aquatic creature cannot survive significant changes in water temperature, it’s critical to keep a consistent environment by utilizing an aquarium heater.\n3. pH Level\nSince fluctuations in pH levels can stress them out and cause health problems, you should use a pH test kit to keep the pH level stable.\nZebra Angelfish grow big and tall, so they need a lot of space to swim and explore. A minimum tank size of 30 gallons is ideal for a single fish.\nHowever, if you want to house them in a group of three species or more, you’ll need a tank aquarium of at least 55 gallons.\n2. Tank Decoration\nZebra angels prefer to hide in aquarium plants and river rock formations since they will feel safer.\nAmazon sword plants (Echinodorus) or other large-leaved plants like elodea would be ideal for providing cover, nesting spots, and keeping the fish calm.\nIn addition, you can add sandy or fine gravel substrate, driftwood roots, and small caves to make their environment more natural and comfortable.\nZebra Angelfish thrive on excellent water quality and gentle water movement. Therefore, to maintain suitable water quality and retain beneficial microorganisms, you should install a high-quality filtration system.\nThis species will benefit from using an external canister filter, which has a tiny powerhead to provide gentle water movement.\nZebra Angelfish Compatibility\nThe zebra angelfish (pterophyllum scalare) is a sociable species that live in groups.\nAs juveniles, they are peaceful schooling fish. However, when Zebra angel fish reach maturity, they pair off and become more territorial.\nHowever, it is not suggested to keep them with other tiny fish since zabra angels will feed on any other fish that may fit in their mouths, such as neon tetras and mosquito danios.\nZebra Angelfish Diet\nThe zebra angelfish is a species of omnivore that should be fed a variety of meats and vegetables.\nGenerally, their diet should consist of:\n- Tubifex Worms\n- Flake foods\n- Frozen meals\nWhen it comes to feeding frequency, they should be fed twice a day in the amount of food that they will consume in 5 minutes.\nHowever, if they are kept in an aquarium with many other fast-swimming species, it would be necessary to feed them three times a day.\nZebra Angelfish Breeding\nZebra angelfish are egg layers that dwell in nuclear families. They are open breeders and lay their eggs on submerged leaves in the wild.\nIn captivity, they are ready to breed when they are 6 to 12 months old, generally around 2 inches long.\nWhen you notice that two fish paired off and the male is chasing the female, it’s a good indication that breeding is about to happen.\nTo induce spawning, there are a few things you can do:\n- Place a flowerpot, a piece of slate, or a leafy plant in the tank for the pair to lay their eggs on\n- Feed a diet of protein-rich foods\n- Maintain a pH level of 6.5\n- Maintain water hardness of about 5° dGH\n- Keep the temperature between 80 and 85° F\nAfter that, the female will lay around 1000 eggs on a clean surface when ready to breed. Then the male embraces her and fertilizes them.\nIf the parents don’t devour the eggs right away, they’ll hatch after three or four days and the little fry will be free swimming in around a week.\nFor the first few weeks, you can feed the fry newly hatched baby brine shrimp until they can consume finely crushed flake food on their own.\nZebra Angelfish Gender Difference\nThe way a zebra angelfish behaves and its size are the only ways to distinguish between male and female zebra angelfish.\nAs zebra angelfish mature, males grow larger and more aggressive, while females become smaller and more docile.\nIf a male dies or is removed from the leadership of his group by an external force such as illness then it’s possible that the next zabra angel in line for power could turn into a male.\nPossible Diseases and Prevention\nWhite Spot Disease\nZebra Angelfish are susceptible to the same diseases that affect other saltwater angelfish in captivity, particularly if their habitat is disrupted or they are housed with unsuitable tankmates.\nThe most common disease affecting tangs and angelfish is white spot disease, also known as Marine Ich, Saltwater Ich, and Crypt.\nThe most prominent signs of Marine Ick include constant scratching that leads to a large number of white patches.\nThe velvet disease, Oodinium ocellatum (also known as Amyloodinium ocellatum or Branchiophilus Maris), is a flagellate that affects fish.\nMarine Velvet symptoms include:\n- Peppery covering and hooked fins\n- Respiratory difficulties (breathing rapidly as seen by frequent or rapid gill movements)\n- Eye cloudiness\n- Possible weight loss\nParasites on aquarium fish kept in tanks with live rock or in a reef tank are notoriously hard to get rid of.\nZebra angels infected with parasites will show the following symptoms:\n- Loss of appetite\n- Scratching on rocks or decorations\n- Excessive mucus production\n- Weight loss\nMetronidazole and other anthracyclines are effective and safe in the treatment of a variety of protozoan and anaerobic bacterial infections.\nAlso, you can raise the temperature of your tank gradually for external parasites to at least 82° F (28° C) since this will prevent the parasite from completing its life cycle.\nHow Big Do Zebra Angelfish Get?\nZebra angels can grow up to 10 inches long.\nWhat Is the Difference Between Male and Female Zebra Angelfish?\nThe main difference between male and female zebra angelfish is their size. Males are larger and more aggressive, while females are smaller and more docile.\nWhat Do Zebra Angelfish Eat?\nZebra angels are omnivores and will eat a variety of food, including live, frozen, and flake foods.\nHow Many Eggs Do Zebra Angelfish Lay?\nFemales can lay up to 1000 eggs which will hatch in 3-4 days. The fry will be free swimming in around a week.\nWhat Is the Minimum Size for a Zebra Angelfish Tank?\nThe minimum tank size for a zebra angelfish is 30 gallons.\nZebra angels are a beautiful and popular saltwater fish that make a great addition to any aquarium.\nThey are relatively easy to care for, but there are a few things to keep in mind, such as their minimum tank size and their diet.\nWith proper care, your zebra angel will thrive and provide you with years of enjoyment.\nWe hope you enjoyed reading this and found it helpful.

684	what happens integrity selfworth student caught cheating academic dishonesty institutional procedures consequences	When caught cheating, there are both personal and institutional consequences. On a personal level, cheating lowers self-esteem by implying one isn't smart enough to handle learning, causes stress from fear of getting caught, and compromises personal integrity. Institutionally, the Ethics Committee will investigate the case within 60 days and may issue penalties ranging from a warning notice to suspension of grants. In minor cases, they may demand a Letter of Apology, while serious misconduct can result in salary deductions or contract suspensions.

No Covered Party may take unfair advantage of another person through harassment, manipulation, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other unfair practice.\n- Covered Parties must maintain the confidentiality of confidential information entrusted to them, except when disclosure is authorized by an appropriate officer of the College or required by law.\n- Investigator has to discover the relevant research problem and prepare a project proposal.\n- The proposal has to submit to a funding agency through K-RIC.\n- The Principal Investigator (PI) leads the project and keep track of the experimental process.\n- Principal Investigator has to ensure that the results are published in the form of reports or research papers in journals.\n- Principal Investigator should also inspire young researchers.\nRESPONSIBILITIES OF A RESEARCH STUDENT\n- Initially, the Research Student should consult his mentor/expert before conducting the research.\n- After consulting his/ her mentor, student must thoroughly discuss the research design, program of research, questionnaire etc.\n- Research student should be conscious of issues which are pertaining to plagiarism, intellectual property (IP), and falsification of data, and unnecessary delays in completion of their research work.\nWHAT CONSTITUTES MISCONDUCT?\nMisconduct does not include honest error or honest differences in interpretation or judgment in evaluating research methods or results, or misconduct unrelated to the research process.\nIn case of misconduct or deviation of recommended ethical practices by a research investigator or a research student, disciplinary action can be taken against them if their guilt is proved.\nThe acts which are considered as research misconduct comprises:\n- Fabrication – Reporting of experiments never conducted\n- Falsification – Misrepresentation or suppression of data to project a desired result\n- Plagiarism – Reporting another’s data as one’s own\n- Fraud – Deliberate and wilful suppression of previous work in publications to claim originality or to avoid quoting previous publications contrary to present results.\n- Breach of confidentiality - Presenting as one’s own ideas or data obtained from privileged access to original grants, manuscripts etc. is also considered as misdemeanour in the same category.\n- Violation – Violation of intellectual property rights;\n- Misuse of Funds – Misuse of research funds or resources provided by the University or an external sponsor.\nREPORTING OF CASES OF MISCONDUCT\n- Anyone has the right to report an observed, suspected or apparent misconduct to the members of the Ethics Committee when he or she becomes aware of it.\n- If an individual is unsure whether a suspected incident of misconduct falls within the definition of Misconduct, he or she should discuss this with the members of the Ethics Committee informally.\nREPORTING AND EVALUATION OF THE COMPLAINT\n- The charge of misconduct has serious effects for all concerned. Therefore, investigation related to the review of suspected misconduct will be kept confidential to the maximum extent possible.\n- The Committee should conduct a preliminary review of the report and provide an immediate opinion to the Principal Investigator.\n- If the Principal decides to set up an investigation committee, the Ethics Committee should recommend its members to the Principal to form an Investigation Committee.\nThe scope of the committee shall be:\n- To investigate the accuracy of charge of misconduct\n- To assess the extent and nature of alleged misconduct\n- The committee is expected to complete the investigations and report submission within a period of 60 (sixty) days.\n- Upon completion of investigation, the Ethics Committee should decide whether or not to take or recommend disciplinary action(s).\n- In a case of minor misconduct, the Ethics Committee is authorized to issue a Notice of Warning to or demand a Letter of Apology from an individual who is responsible for the misconduct.\n- In a case of serious misconduct, the Ethics Committee should decide whether or not to endorse consents. The consents may include, but are not restricted to:\n- Resubmission of a research work;\n- A letter of warning issued by the Principal Investigator which may or may not be recorded in the personal file of the individual;\n- Deduction from salary;\n- Suspension of grant/contract;\nThe right to interpret the provisions hereof rests with the Governing Council of the Institution. The Governing Council may give authorization to the Ethics Committee to interpret the provisions on its behalf as well.', '6.5 The Honest Truth\n- Understand the importance of academic integrity and the consequences of dishonesty.\n- Identify most common types of academic dishonesty.\nThroughout this book we have focused on the active process of learning, not just on how to get good grades. The attitude of some students that grades are the end-all in academics has led many students to resort to academic dishonesty to try to get the best possible grades or handle the pressure of an academic program. Although you may be further tempted if you’ve heard people say, “Everybody does it,” or “It’s no big deal at my school,” you should be mindful of the consequences of cheating:\n- You don’t learn as much. Cheating may get you the right answer on a particular exam question, but it won’t teach you how to apply knowledge in the world after school, nor will it give you a foundation of knowledge for learning more advanced material. When you cheat, you cheat yourself out of opportunities.\n- You risk failing the course or even expulsion from school. Each institution has its own definitions of and penalties for academic dishonesty, but most include cheating, plagiarism, and fabrication or falsification. The exact details of what is allowed or not allowed vary somewhat among different colleges and even instructors, so you should be sure to check your school’s Web site and your instructor’s guidelines to see what rules apply. Ignorance of the rules is seldom considered a valid defense.\n- Cheating causes stress. Fear of getting caught will cause you stress and anxiety; this will get in the way of performing well with the information you do know.\n- You’re throwing away your money and time. Getting a college education is a big investment of money and effort. You’re simply not getting your full value when you cheat, because you don’t learn as much.\n- You are trashing your integrity. Cheating once and getting away with it makes it easier to cheat again, and the more you cheat, the more comfortable you will feel with giving up your integrity in other areas of life—with perhaps even more serious consequences.\n- Cheating lowers your self-esteem. If you cheat, you are telling yourself that you are simply not smart enough to handle learning. It also robs you of the feeling of satisfaction from genuine success.\nResist the temptation to cheat by using material from the Internet.\nThomas Favre-Bulle – Working on UML – CC BY-NC 2.0.\nTechnology has made it easier to cheat. Your credit card and an Internet connection can procure a paper for you on just about any subject and length. You can copy and paste for free from various Web sites. Students have made creative use of texting and video on their cell phones to gain unauthorized access to material for exams. But be aware that technology has also created ways for instructors to easily detect these forms of academic dishonesty. Most colleges make these tools available to their instructors. Instructors are also modifying their testing approaches to reduce potential academic misconduct by using methods that are harder to cheat at (such as in-class essays that evaluate your thinking and oral presentations).\nIf you feel uneasy about doing something in your college work, trust your instincts. Confirm with the instructor that your intended form of research or use of material is acceptable. Cheating just doesn’t pay.\nExamples of Academic Dishonesty\nAcademic dishonesty can take many forms, and you should be careful to avoid them. The following list from Northwestern University is a clear and complete compilation of what most institutions will consider unacceptable academic behavior.\n- Cheating: using unauthorized notes, study aids, or information on an examination; altering a graded work after it has been returned, then submitting the work for regrading; allowing another person to do one’s work and submitting that work under one’s own name; submitting identical or similar papers for credit in more than one course without prior permission from the course instructors.\n- Plagiarism: submitting material that in part or whole is not entirely one’s own work without attributing those same portions to their correct source.\n- Fabrication: falsifying or inventing any information, data or citation; presenting data that were not gathered in accordance with standard guidelines defining the appropriate methods for collecting or generating data and failing to include an accurate account of the method by which the data were gathered or collected.\n- Obtaining an Unfair Advantage: (a) stealing, reproducing, circulating or otherwise gaining access to examination materials prior to the time authorized by the instructor; (b) stealing, destroying, defacing or concealing library materials with the purpose of depriving others of their use; (c) unauthorized collaboration on an academic assignment; (d) retaining, possessing, using or circulating previously given examination materials, where those materials clearly indicate that they are to be returned to the instructor at the conclusion of the examination; (e) intentionally obstructing or interfering with another student’s academic work; or (f) otherwise undertaking activity with the purpose of creating or obtaining an unfair academic advantage over other students’ academic work.\n- Aiding and Abetting Academic Dishonesty: (a) providing material, information, or other assistance to another person with knowledge that such aid could be used in any of the violations stated above, or (b) providing false information in connection with any inquiry regarding academic integrity.\n- Falsification of Records and Official Documents: altering documents affecting academic records; forging signatures of authorization or falsifying information on an official academic document, grade report, letter of permission, petition, drop/add form, ID card, or any other official University document.\n- Unauthorized Access to computerized academic or administrative records or systems: viewing or altering computer records, modifying computer programs or systems, releasing or dispensing information gained via unauthorized access, or interfering with the use or availability of computer systems or information.\n- Being dishonest can have major consequences that can affect not only your college career but also your life beyond college.\n- “Everybody does it” and “It’s no big deal at my school” are not valid reasons for cheating.\n- When you cheat, you are primarily cheating yourself.\nWhat are the most common forms of academic dishonesty you have heard about at your school? What should be done about them?\nWhat resources do you have on campus to learn about correct forms of referencing other people’s work in your own?\nUndergraduate Academic Conduct Committee of Northwestern University, “Definitions of Academic Violations,” http://www.northwestern.edu/uacc/defines.html (accessed July 13, 2010).']	['<urn:uuid:8a078e9e-378b-460f-95d0-b7a7b3379b36>', '<urn:uuid:5e6da88e-6651-41fc-9512-1be65bbcbd5e>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-01T23:21:14.341336	12	82	2135
681	I love gardens and fountains, and I heard the park at the Palace of Caserta is beautiful. What can you tell me about the fountains and water features there?	The park at the Palace of Caserta stretches for 120 hectares and features a long alley with artificial fountains and cascades. There are several notable fountains along a wide straight canal that runs to the horizon, including the Fountain of Diana and Actaeon, the Fountain of Venus and Adonis, the Fountain of the Dolphins, the Fountain of Aeolus, and the Fountain of Ceres. These water features were designed with architecture and hydraulics by Luigi Vanvitelli, and they were considered to rival those at Peterhof outside St. Petersburg.

We will call you back right away!!!\nClick and discover how to visit Caserta staying at the Hotel Olimpico >>\nPalace of Caserta\n18th-Century Royal Palace at Caserta with the Park, the Aqueduct of Vanvitelli, and the San Leucio Complex *\nUNESCO World Heritage Site Der bourbonische Königspalast in Caserta.\nThe Royal Palace of Caserta (Italian: Reggia di Caserta) is a former royal residence in Caserta, southern Italy, constructed for the Bourbon kings of Naples. It was the largest palace and one of the largest buildings erected in Europe during the 18th century. In 1997, the Palace was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, described in its nomination as ""the swan song of the spectacular art of the Baroque, from which it adopted all the features needed to create the illusions of multidirectional space"".\nThe construction of the palace was begun in 1752 for Charles VII of Naples, who worked closely with his architect Luigi Vanvitelli. When Charles saw Vanvitelli\'s grandly-scaled model for Caserta it filled him with emotion ""fit to tear his heart from his breast"". In the end, he never slept a night at the Reggia, as he abdicated in 1759 to become King of Spain, and the project was carried to completion for his third son and successor, Ferdinand IV of Naples.\nThe political and social model for Vanvitelli\'s palace was Versailles, which, though it is strikingly different in its variety and disposition, solves similar problems of assembling and providing for king, court and government in a massive building with the social structure of a small city, confronting a baroque view of a highly subordinated nature, la nature forcée. The Royal Palace of Madrid, where Charles had grown up, which had been devised by Filippo Juvarra for Charles\' father, Philip V of Spain, and Charlottenburg Palace provided models. A spacious octagonal vestibule seems to have been inspired by Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute in Venice, while the palatine chapel is most often compared to Robert de Cotte\'s royal chapel at Versailles.\nThe king\'s primary object was to have a magnificent new royal court and administrative center for the Kingdom in a location protected from sea attack.\nVanvitelli died in 1773: the construction was continued by his son Carlo and finished in 1780.\nThe palace has some 1,200 rooms, including two dozen state apartments, a large library, and a theatre modelled after the Teatro San Carlo of Naples.\nMain façade of the palace.\nThe Honour Grand Staircase.\nThe throne room.\nThe Diana and Actaeon Fountain at the feet of the Grand Cascade.\nThe population of Caserta Vecchia was moved 10 kilometers to provide a work force closer to the palace. A silk manufactory at San Leucio resort was disguised as a pavilion in the immense parkland.\nA monumental avenue that would run 20 kilometers between the Palace and Naples was planned but never realized.\nIn April 1945 the palace was the site of the signing of terms of the unconditional German surrender of forces in Italy. The agreement covered between 600,000 and 900,000 soldiers along the Italian Front including troops in sections of Austria.\nThe palace has a rectangular plan, measuring 247 x 184 m. The four sides are connected by two orthogonal arms, forming four inner courts, each measuring more than 3,800 m2 (40,903 sq ft).\nBehind the facades of its matching segmental ranges of outbuildings that flank the giant forecourt, a jumble of buildings arose to facilitate daily business. In the left hand arc was built as barracks. Here, later, during World War II the soldiers of the US Fifth Army recovered in a ""rest centre"".\nOf all the royal residences inspired by the Palace of Versailles, the Reggia of Caserta is the one that bears the greatest resemblance to the original model: the unbroken balustraded skyline, the slight break provided by pavilions within the long, somewhat monotonous facade. As at Versailles, a large aqueduct was required to bring water for the prodigious water displays. Like its French predecessor, the palace was intended to display the power and grandeur of an absolute Bourbon monarchy. A solecism at Caserta is that above the piano reale, the King\'s floor, is another floor of equal magnificence. The enfilades of Late Baroque saloni were the heart and seat of government, as well as displays of national wealth. Caserta provided a royal refuge from the dust and factions of the capital, just as Versailles had freed Louis XIV from Paris. The inland location was more defensible than the old Royal Palace in Naples, which fronted the Bay of Naples and hence was vulnerable to attack from the sea. To provide the King with suitable protection, troop barracks were housed within the palace.\nThe wide central entrance carriageway has, today, been incorporated into the city\'s automobile circulation.\n The park\nThe garden, a typical example of the baroque extension of formal vistas, stretch for 120 ha, partly on hilly terrain. It is inspired by the park of Versailles, but it is commonly regarded as superior in beauty. The park starts from the back façade of the palace, flanking a long alley with artificial fountains and cascades. There is a botanical garden, called ""The English Garden,"" in the upper part designed in the 1780s by Carlo Vanvitelli and the London-trained plantsman-designer John Graefer, recommended to Sir William Hamilton by Sir Joseph Banks. It is an early Continental example of an ""English garden"" in the svelte naturalistic taste of Capability Brown.\nThe fountains and cascades, each filling a vasca (""basin""), with architecture and hydraulics by Luigi Vanvitelli at intervals along a wide straight canal that runs to the horizon, rivalled those at Peterhof outside St. Petersburg. These include:\nThe Fountain of Diana and Actaeon (sculptures by Paolo Persico, Brunelli, Pietro Solari);\nThe Fountain of Venus and Adonis (1770–80);\nThe Fountain of the Dolphins (1773–80);\nThe Fountain of Aeolus;\nThe Fountain of Ceres.\nA large population of figures from classical Antiquity were modelled by Gaetano Salomone for the gardens of the Reggia, and executed by large workshops.']"	['<urn:uuid:21768f5c-7d6a-4b1b-85b6-a6b7309f0d6d>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-01T23:21:14.341336	29	87	1039
1044	How do temporary installations enable artistic experimentation and ensure accessibility standards?	Temporary installations like those at music festivals allow testing of experimental concepts that permanent cities may not be ready for politically, economically, socially, or architecturally. For instance, the 227788c collective creates inflatable installations that challenge architectural assumptions and facilitate new behaviors. However, even temporary installations must meet accessibility standards, including minimum clear widths of 1,500 mm for paths, firm and stable surfaces that won't impede mobility devices, and proper slopes or ramps for any change in level. These requirements ensure that all people, including those with disabilities, can safely access and navigate these spaces.	['Melbourne-based collective 227788c works “across and between” architecture, art, events and technology. Founded in 2015 by graduate architects James Bowman Fletcher and Alexander Gibson and architect Jack May, the collective has created a number of inflatable installations that both entertain and challenge assumptions about architecture. The group has exhibited pieces at a number of music festivals – as well as hosting their own Blow-Up Festival in collaboration with the pneumatic structures unit at RMIT University in 2016. Most recently, they exhibited at the Folk Architects-designed Watchmaker satellite exhibition space for the National Gallery of Victoria’s (NGV) Melbourne Design Week. ArchitectureAU spoke to 227768c about their work and what it attempts to say about architecture.\nYou’re architecturally trained and you’ve inflated massive plastic envelopes at music festivals – this is slightly unusual. How did you get here? How does architecture fit into this work?\nIn terms of how we got here, we were commissioned to produce a spatial installation for a festival. Our project Music Apparatus 1 consisted of an envelope which separated an artificially created haze from the open-air festival environment. In allowing festival patrons to block or homogenize their visual field, the apparatus would draw one’s attention to the music, not the visual milieu of the festival.\nIn this case the inflated membrane merely became an envelope to contain haze and for us the project is the haze and the music, not the envelope.\nAlthough the lineage of architecturally designed structures at music festivals is well established, it doesn’t form part of our collective consciousness. For some reason, the discipline of architecture doesn’t seem very interested in recognizing it.\nOn this note, we just completed a work as part of the NGV’s Melbourne Design Week, whereby we transplanted the essential components of our project Apparatus 4c into an exhibition context, in an attempt to highlight the potential feedback this kind of work can have and its influence on other areas of architecture.\nWe believe our work has many consequences upon the architectural discipline, whether tectonic lessons or explorations into how ideas can be materialized outside of more conventional architectural modes where they may not yet survive. We are already undertaking domestic scale projects that have inherited knowledge from our temporary structure projects.\nIs there something you’d like architects to learn or take away from your work?\nThe thing we want architects to take away is within each project and also dispersed across all of them.\nWe are interested in work that facilitates behaviour that was not previously facilitated, whilst also provoking reflection relating to the absence and presence of those behaviours.\nOur recently completed Apparatus 4b project attempted to create a machine that is not efficient or convenient but has value. The value of machines, within architecture and outside of architecture, is always attributed to their capacity for compliance in performing tasks desired and determined by the master.\nOur machine uses an algorithm to alter the form of an inhabitable surface through the raising and lowering of linear actuator columns supporting the surface. This algorithm is not responsive, it merely choses time intervals haphazardly from number sets that enable the actuators to manipulate the surface, making it difficult to determine what will move next and for how long. The algorithm creates a situation whereby the form of the surface is not a slave to the user or master’s comfort. Users are required to continuously reevaluate and adapt their posture and location in relation to the structure and others as the actuators subtly shift their bodies, causing unforeseen and unintended physical relationships between users.\nWhat is it about the music festival that suits your work?\nWe understand the music festival context as a temporary or draft-like city and therefore it is well suited to our desire to test slightly more dubious concepts that a more permanent city may not yet be politically, economically, socially or architecturally ready for.\nThe sight of your Performative Canopy, a luminous dirigible floating over a backyard in Brunswick, is striking. What is it about a suburban setting that interests you?\nWell, for us it is less of an interest in the suburban and more of an interest in the questionable site of domesticity.\n“Domestic-ness” was once considered to be tied to the physical entity of the house. Reyner Banham’s Un-house, among other works, shattered that notion as domesticity expanded to almost anywhere. The Californian bungalow where our event [in Brunswick] took place is a house that enables living, but we also think it can enable a number of other things with very minor formal and even non-spatial components which can influence the activity and behaviour within the environment. This led us to become interested in the medium of event and how it work[s] in tandem with a series of designed interventions to repurpose a domestic setting of a Californian bungalow into an event environment.\nThis project was the result of research undertaken as part of a subject we ran in RMIT’s architecture program in 2016.', 'Under the Design of Public Spaces Standard of the AODA, cities and other organizations building or reconstructing exterior paths of travel, such as sidewalks and walkways, must make those paths accessible to travellers with disabilities. Rules for accessible exterior paths of travel apply to private organizations with 50 or more workers and all public sector organizations.\nAccessible Exterior Paths: What You Need to Know\nBefore building, organizations must consult the public and people with disabilities about the need for rest areas. Rest areas are locations where travellers can step out of the flow of traffic for a short time. Cities that have municipal accessibility advisory committees must also consult their committees about rest areas before building or redeveloping paths.\nThe Standard lists minimum requirements for many aspects of exterior paths. Entrances must have clear openings of at least 850 mm. Moreover, paths must have minimum clear widths of 1,500 mm. This width allows room for mobility devices or service animals going both ways along a path. However, parts of a path that connect to a curb ramp can be 1,200 mm wide. In addition, paths must have minimum head room clearances of 2,100 mm. This height ensures that paths are free of obstacles overhead that white canes cannot detect, like signs or tree branches. If part of a path does not have this clearance, that section should have a cane-detectable railing or barrier around it.\nPaths must have firm, stable, and slip-resistant surfaces that canes, crutches, or the wheels of mobility devices will not sink into. Likewise, if there are openings in a path’s surface, they must be smaller than 20 mm. This size prevents mobility devices from getting stuck in the openings. Long, narrow openings should be at right angles to the direction of travel. Finally, Any change in the level of a path must have a slope or ramp. Similarly, sidewalks with steep or depressed curbs must have curb ramps. All slopes and curb ramps must comply with the requirements for them listed in the Design of Public Spaces Standard.\nAccessible pedestrian signals provide audio or tactile information about whether it is safe to cross at intersections or crosswalks. Signals must have locator tones to help travellers find them. These tones must be different from the walk indicator tones that tell travellers when it is safe to cross. In addition to the audible walk indicator tones, signals must vibrate so that travellers who are deafblind will know when they should cross.\nMoreover, signals must be no more than 1,500 mm away from curbs. The push-buttons on the signals must be no higher than 1,100 mm off the ground. The arrow-shaped buttons must be tactile and point in the direction that travellers should cross. Furthermore, signals should function both manually, when someone presses the button, and automatically. Two signals on one corner should be at least 3,000 mm apart. When there is not enough room on a corner and the two signals must be on the same post, verbal announcements must clearly state which street is safe to cross.\nRamps and Stairs\nMany of the minimum requirements for flat paths also apply to ramps. The Design of Public Spaces Standard provides additional detailed technical requirements for the construction of ramps, handrails, and landings.\nThe Standard also gives detailed technical requirements for stairs. Stairs can never be the only way of changing levels on a path because some travellers always use ramps. However, many other travellers with disabilities need or prefer to use stairs. When stairs are included on an exterior path, they must be slip-resistant and have closed risers. Furthermore, stairs in the same flight must be the same size. Additionally, they must have good colour contrast all the way along the edge of every step. Good contrast ensures that travellers with low vision can see where each step is. Likewise, there should be a tactile change in a path’s surface at the top of each flight. Tactile surfaces indicate to travellers who are blind that the flight is approaching.\nWhy do we need Accessible Exterior Paths of Travel?\nSidewalks, walkways, and other paths are everywhere in Ontario. Accessible exterior paths of travel ensure that everyone in the province has basic freedom of movement: across the street to visit a neighbour, around the corner to the local convenience store, or a few blocks away to catch the bus.']	['<urn:uuid:8b665300-9024-4aa5-a111-e352c35549ae>', '<urn:uuid:64883394-e8e8-4ed7-8bc2-d3521297016a>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-02T10:56:22.807332	11	94	1559
431	inherited grandma antique ring make it bigger possible problems	Antique rings can be resized, but there may be some discoloration around the repair area, particularly with older white gold rings. The cause of discoloration isn't always known by jewelers, though they make efforts to minimize lines or discoloration. Usually, such imperfections are only noticeable with a magnifying glass.	['People resize rings for many different reasons. For some it is weight loss or weight gain, and for others it is simply to be able to wear the ring on a different finger. Resizing is very common and can be done on most rings, but there are some exceptions. To better understand when sizing can and cannot be done, one must understand the process.\nMaking a Ring Smaller\nDecreasing the band size on a ring is fairly easy when done by a jeweler. For the ring to be made smaller, the jeweler must cut out a small portion of the band. The ring must then be reshaped to the proper circular shape and then it can be soldered back together. The jeweler must make a weld that is virtually invisible, and it must then be polished and smoothed so that no indication of the sizing is visible.\nThis method can easily be used for rings with a plain shank or band. Rings which are ornate or have a design which carries around the complete band will need to be rebuilt over the sizing. There is sometimes an area on ornate rings which has been left for resizing. This area, however, is usually used for making the ring larger instead of smaller.\nSome rings have jewels all around the band or are channel style less than half way around the band, and may require the jeweler to remove the gems before sizing. This depends on the setting and pattern. For rings being made smaller, the diamonds or gems may be moved to balance the setting of the ring.\nMaking a ring larger\nIncreasing the size of a ring can be done two ways. When a ring needs to be made just slightly larger, sometimes a jeweler can stretch the ring to the desired size. The ring needs to be cut and an additional piece of the shank or band soldered in if the size increase is a half size or larger. If a jeweler needs to resize an ornately patterned ring, or one with jewels throughout the band, the sizing can pose a problem. The jeweler will discuss options with you which may include changing the setting.\nRings not to re-size\nYou should not try to re-size a ring which has channel set stones more than half way around the band. If the ring has an elaborate setting or certain types of gems, some of the stones may need to be removed and reset before the ring can be sized. If the ring is an antique or is an older white gold ring, there may be some discoloration around the repair area. It is not always possible for the jeweler to know the cause of the discoloration. Most jewelers will make every effort to minimize lines or discoloration on the ring. Usually it is only noticeable with the use of a magnifying glass. It is imperative that you discuss options with your jeweler.\nCeltic rings with the design all the way around the band can be made slightly larger or smaller without distorting the pattern. Increases or decreases of a significant amount are usually not successful without distortion to the pattern.']	['<urn:uuid:d65ef033-2636-43a1-bc38-de00dbb34064>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-01T22:47:46.423955	9	49	530
981	bag manufacturer seeking specialized machinery options workspace efficiency requirements proper safety protocols	For efficient bag manufacturing, there are three main machine options: Cylinder Arm (ideal for large bags with space under horizontal arm), Flat Bed (built into table with flat surface), and Post Bed (upright arm for tight corners). Regarding workspace safety protocols, all machines require safeguards that prevent contact with dangerous moving parts, are securely attached, protect from falling objects, and don't create interference with operations. The safeguards must be durable, firmly secured, and allow safe lubrication. These measures protect against hazardous mechanical motions while maintaining production efficiency.	"['Before I get into my very first ‘serious’ blog post about making handbags, I wanted to take the opportunity to say how grateful and overwhelmed I am for all the support I’ve received on my venture into blogging! You guys are seriously awesome, thank you so much for coming along on this journey with me into the unknown!\nSo moving on….my first post. This post is for Vicky, who messaged me last week to ask about sewing machines for bag making. There are many and varied tools you need for bag making but the key one you need is the sewing machine…..\nI originally published this post and it was MASSIVE – you seriously needed one, maybe even two cups of coffee, to get through it! So I’ve now broken it up into three, more manageable parts.\nPART 1: Sewing Machines for Bag Making… is a great starting point. I talk generally about the different types of machines and what they are called and introduce you to what I use for bag making. This part continues below.\nPART 2: What Bag Making Sewing Machine for me?…. picks up on your new basic knowledge of different sewing machines used for bag making. It includes considerations you need to make about which machine is going to suit you, your general sewing goals, space availability and finances….all of which are relevant when deciding on a machine to suit you best. If you are looking for this, please click here.\nPART 3: Buying a Bag Making Sewing Machine… having considered and identified what machine suits you and your bag making goals, it’s now time to go and test drive. Part 3 gets you ready to go and test drive, and arms you with things to take with you, what to look for and questions to ask. If you are ready to purchase a machine and are looking for this post, please click here.\nSo here we are, at the beginning and what are the different machines in bag making. Read on…\nBAG MAKING SEWING MACHINES:\nFor me, the Cylinder Arm is the most ideal sewing machine you can use for leather bag making. It is industrial machines that go by this name and it’s called at Cylinder Arm because of the cylinder shaped arm that extends out horizontally from the main body of the machine. With a Cylinder Arm, you will also find the needle is positioned right at the very end of the arm. At university in the handbag making rooms, all but a few machines were Cylinder Arms. These are ideal, particularly for making large handbags, with the amount of space available underneath the horizontal arm to manipulate the bag around while sewing. Some Cylinder Arms will also come with part of the table cut out allowing you to sew even larger bags.\nMy Pfaff 335 Cylinder Arm Machine with Walking Foot, who I call Percy\nAs the name suggests, the sewing area of the Flat Bed machine is flat. This machine is typically built into the table so it’s all one flat surface. Larger bags can still be made on this machine but it will need more manipulation, and depending on the type of bag and how they are constructed, some areas you won’t be able to get into with a flatbed. More consideration will need to go into what bags you make and how you make them, in order to do them from beginning to end on a Flat Bed.\nPfaff 135 Flat Bed\nThe last type of sewing machine for bags is a Post Bed. Again this is a name used for industrial machines and it is called this for the single arm that stands upright on the machine like a fence post. Traditionally a Post Bed machine is used in footware manufacture, but they are also very useful in bag making as they can get into some very tight corners that you wouldn’t be able to get into with the Cylinder Arm or Flat Bed. Indeed there are some bag makers that make entire bags with a Post Bed machine and prefer them over other machine types, it’s all a matter of preference.\nMy Pfaff 191 Post Bed Machine with Roller Foot, affectionately known as Patsy\nAll of the above machines can be used exclusively for making bags. However, having a combination machine opens up more options in your bag making. The most common combination machine is a Cylinder Arm and a Flat Bed, and there are three ways they can be achieved.\n1) The most common way is with a domestic table-top sewing machine. These machines have a flat area, smaller compared to a dedicated Flat Bed machine, but still big enough to hold most sewing projects flat. Then by removing the storage compartment, a ‘free arm’ will be revealed. This arm will be more square, the needle will be position further in on the free arm and the distance between the bottom of the arm and the table will be smaller than a dedicated Cylinder Arm machine….. but with some manipulation, it will still allow you room to manoeuvre larger bags around the machine. An additional table top attachment can also be purchased and added to make a larger flat service for sewing.\nBrother NS30 Domestic Sewing Machine – Flat Bed to Free Arm to table top Extension\n2) The next way is to use a specially designed sewing table or sewing cabinet for a table top domestic machine. These sewing tables and cabinets have a lever system, where the machine can be positioned in two locations, therefore making a Flat Bed or a Cylinder Arm equivalent. Locking the lever, where the top of the machine is level with the top of the table, a Flat Bed machine has been made. An extra extensions can also be purchased to close up any gaps between the table and the sewing machine. The machine can also be completely raised so the base of the machine is at table top level, just as it would be if you didn’t have a cabinet and were sewing on the dining room table. Remove the storage compartment to access the free arm and again you will have two machines in one.\nA Horn Sewing Cabinet ‘Cub Plus’, in a flat bed position (with extension)\nHorn Sewing Cabinet ‘Cub Plus’ in a table top position.\n3) Lastly you can convert your industrial Cylinder Arm to a Flat Bed through a table top extension for your Cylinder Arm. This table top will fit around the arm and lock into place, providing you with a large flat work area. With a little bit of searching, you can find this attachment to purchase for your type of machine, or if you are clever enough you can make it yourself.\nA purchased Cylinder Arm table top extension\nA home-made Cylinder Arm table top extension\nSEWING MACHINES I USE\nI sew bags combining different leathers and fabrics, and I am fortunate enough to have a dedicated studio for making my bags. My handbag making studio is made up of:\n- Industrial Cylinder Arm (Pfaff 335), with a walking foot;\n- Industrial Post Bed (Pfaff 191), with a rolling foot;\n- Very basic table top domestic machine, (Brother NS30), with flat-bed attachment;\n- Domestic overlocker (Brother 3034D).\nIn addition, I have a leather Skiving Machine in the studio and another domestic Brother NS30 sewing machine that I keep at home for odd jobs. The only machines I purchased new were one of the Brother NS30’s and the overlocker….all the rest were second-hand.\nI don’t have an industrial Flat Bed machine. Instead, I have crafted my own table top extension to fit around my Cylinder Arm, converting it to a Flat Bed. I’ve done this with a cardboard box, which is a cheap and very effective option. It’s only now, after having the machine for 10 years, that I’ve had to re-do my cardboard box flat bed extension as the sticky tape gave out!\nMy cardboard table top Flat Bed extension for my Cylinder Arm Machine\nNow in terms of what I use most for bag making, I use my Cylinder Arm (with and without cardboard box extension) 85% of the time, table top domestic 10%, Post Bed 4% and lastly the overlocker 1% of the time. As you can see – a big fan of the Cylinder Arm!\nAll my leather work is done on either the Cylinder Arm or Post Bed – depending on the design of the bag and which machine is the best fit. I use my domestic machine to make all the bag linings, as the Cylinder Arm and Post Bed would just make a mess of the cottons I use in the linings. The Overlocker is for the linings as well.\nAnd that’s where I’ll cut Part 1 off, with a basic knowledge of the different types of sewing machines used in Bag Making and which machines I use. Part 2 continues after this with what considerations you need to make when purchasing a machine for making handbags.\nUntil then, have a wonderful day and happy sewing.', ""Moving machine parts have the potential to cause severe workplace injuries. Crushed fingers or hands, amputations, burns, or blindness can be prevented through machine safeguards. Simply put, any machine part, function, or process that may cause injury must be safeguarded.\nWhere Mechanical Hazards Occur\nDangerous moving parts in these three basic areas need safeguarding:\n- Point of Operation: is the area where work is being done on a material, such as cutting, shaping, boring, or forming of material.\n- Power Transmission Apparatus: is the area of the mechanical system that transmits energy to the parts of the machine performing the work. These components include flywheels, pulleys, belts, connecting rods, couplings, cams, spindles, chains, cranks, and gears.\n- Other Moving Parts: include all parts of a machine that move while the machine is operating. These parts can be rotating, reciprocating, or transversing. Feed mechanisms and auxiliary parts of the machine are considered other moving parts as well.\nHazardous Mechanical Motions and Actions\nMany mechanical motions and actions present hazards to the worker.\nThe following types of motions and actions are common to nearly all machines and recognizing them and their danger is essential to worker protection.\n- Rotating: Rotating parts are dangerous because they can grip clothing or skin, forcing an arm or hand into a dangerous area.\n- Reciprocating: Reciprocating motions are dangerous because a worker may be struck or pinned during the back and forth or up and down motion.\n- Transverse: Transverse motion is movement in a straight continuous line. The danger in transverse motion lies in the possibility of a worker getting caught in a pinch point or dragged by the part itself.\n- Cutting: The cutting action may involve all three motions and is dangerous at the point of operation. While the cutting action can be dangerous to fingers, limbs, torso and head, flying chips or debris pose a serious danger to the eyes and face.\n- Punching: The punching action results when pressure is applied to the ram for the purpose of stamping metal or other materials. The danger occurs at the point of operation when the material is inserted, held and withdrawn by hand.\n- Shearing: Shearing action involves applying power to a slide or knife to trim or shear metal or other materials. Like the punching actions, the hazard occurs at the point of operation.\n- Bending: The bending action occurs when power is applied to a slide to draw or stamp metal or other material. The hazard occurs at the point of operation, similar to punching and shearing.\nIn order to protect the machine operator, safeguards must meet minimum general requirements.\n- Prevent contact: The safeguard must prevent hands, arms, and any other part of an operator's body from making contact with dangerous moving parts. A good safeguarding system eliminates the possibility of the operator or another worker placing parts of their bodies near hazardous moving parts.\n- Secure: Operators should not be able to easily remove or tamper with the safeguard because a safeguard that can easily be made ineffective is no safeguard at all. Guards and safety devices should be made of durable material that will withstand the conditions of normal use. They must be firmly secured to the machine.\n- Protect from falling objects: The safeguard should ensure that no objects can fall into moving parts. A small tool dropped into a cycling machine could easily become a projectile that could strike and injure someone.\n- Create no new hazards: A safeguard defeats its own purpose if it creates a hazard such as a shear point, a jagged edge, or an unfinished surface that could cause a laceration. The edges of guards, for instance, should be rolled or bolted in such a way to eliminate sharp edges.\n- Create no interference: Any safeguard that impedes an operator from performing the job quickly and comfortably might soon be overridden or disregarded. Proper safeguarding may actually enhance efficiency since it relieves the operator's apprehensions about injury.\n- Allow safe lubrication: If possible, workers should be able to lubricate the machine without removing the safeguards. Locating oil reservoirs outside the guard, with a line leading to the lubrication point, will reduce the need for the operator or maintenance operator to enter the hazardous area.\n- Concepts and Techniques of Machine Guarding , US Department of Labor\n- OSHA Machine Guarding: eTool\n- OSHA Machine Guarding: Safety and Health Topic Page\n- OSHA Guarding of Portable Powered Tools (29 CFR 1910.243""]"	['<urn:uuid:8293cb9b-d533-4018-9b9b-0b0e832e09f4>', '<urn:uuid:ef54e330-945d-4577-bdf6-3daf00e5322a>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-02T00:52:13.802434	12	87	2271
699	What makes gophers come into people's yards and gardens in the first place?	Gophers move onto properties because landscapes supply them with abundant food sources, including garden crops, vines, ornamental plants, shrubs, trees and more to feed on. Additionally, real estate expansion and property development into suburban areas drives increased gopher activity.	['Gopher traps are one of the more reliable and tested forms of gopher control used to get rid of gophers. A key step however in using gopher traps is to keep in mind that gopher traps usually differ from mole traps. In fact, very few traps are effective for both ground mole control and gopher control. Accurately determining the type of burrower in your lawn is a critical step.\nWhy We Need Gopher Control\nGophers move onto our property and into our lawns because our landscapes supply to them a cornucopia of garden crops, vines, ornamental plants, shrubs, trees and more to feed on. Adding to the this, real estate expansion and other types of property development into once suburban areas only drives additional gopher activity.\nHow Do You Get Rid of Gophers?\nMany experts and professionals deem pocket gopher traps to be one of the more effective forms of gopher control and ways to get rid of gophers. Instrumental to the art of gopher trapping, however, is to first understand the biology and behavior of these creatures. Understanding gopher behavior helps property owners improve their efficiency in using gopher traps. You become enabled to more accurately develop strategies on how to trap gophers.\nGopher Biology and Behavior\nThe pocket gopher is active throughout the year and is a herbivore. As herbivores, a gopher’s standard diet includes a wide variety of vegetation, but generally herbaceous plants, roots, shrubs and trees. In many yards it is often common for these ground creatures to completely destroy the roots and the fleshy portions of plants encountered while tunneling. Hence, if you are trying to determine where to find gophers in your lawn, you should typically first start in areas of dense vegetation. As mentioned in our yard mole trapping article, this is similar to one of those “in order to make money, you must follow money” theorems.\nLike that of yard mole traps, gopher traps can be deployed during any time of the year. Gophers are active year round and do not hibernate. Therefore, do not immediately conclude that you have gotten rid of all the gophers simply because you fail to see new gopher mounds or runs.\nNOTE: You may indeed no longer have a gopher control issue. We at Gopher and Mole Control HQ simply want to inform you that it has been a common occurrence in the past for people to no longer see surface tunnels, often leading property owners to believe they have obtained gopher control, when in reality the gophers have only gone deeper underground.\nWhy Gopher Traps are Effective\nGophers unlike yard moles do not leave behind visible surface tunnels. However, gophers too create vast networks of underground tunnels and often their feeding tunnels lay only about five inches below the ground. Should you not understand the difference between mole and gopher mounds, please be sure to take a quick look at our article on the difference between gopher mounds and mole mounds for a brief lesson on the topic.\nAs gophers often use networks of feeding tunnels as tools for acquiring food, the burrowing herbivores are often compelled to keep such tunnels open.\nTHIS VERY FACT IS THE BASIS FOR GOPHER TRAPS AND IS WHAT MAKES THE GOPHER TRAP MOST EFFECTIVE!\nTo be effective, the trap must be set to catch the gopher underground. The goal is to trap (kill) the gopher when it travels through or attempts to plug one of its tunnels. As the gopher maneuvers through its’ gopher tunnel, the idea is to have it trigger the trap by having it press against the trigger pan. In triggering the pan, the gopher trap is released and the gopher is skewered or crushed by the trap. A frequently asked question is why would gophers attempt to plug tunnels that appear to be tampered with or open? The short answer to this question is because pocket gophers are not fond of light in their tunneling systems.\nThe Key to How to Trap a Gopher and Tunnel Selection\nThe key to how to trap a gopher is to first determine where the active gopher tunnels are. As mentioned above, gophers dig systems of deep tunnels with the exception of feeding tunnels. The issue is that most feeding tunnels are only used temporarily. Therefore, the feeding runs may not always be the ideal location to set good pocket gopher traps. Permanent or deeper tunnels typically yield the best results since these gopher tunnels may be used several times daily.\nTo identify such tunnels in your yard or property, look for freshly plugged gopher mounds. In doing this, remember that gopher mounds are not symmetrical like ground mole mounds; instead they are unique fan-like shapes. Gopher mounds are formed in this manner because as gophers dig tunnels and push dirt to the surface, they do so at an angle resulting in crescent and irregular shaped mounds. Also, recognize that you will rarely be able to see gopher tunnels running throughout your yard unlike yard moles.\nNOTE: Should you like to view the manner in which pocket gophers tunnel, you can do so by watching our video of a pocket gopher digging.\nProbing for the Gopher Tunnel\nHere are the three basic steps to probing for a gopher tunnel:\n- Purchase a gopher probe or fashion one from a long pipe or metal rod. Tools such as screw drivers can also be effective. In the event that you choose to create your own probe, add something sturdy to the end of the shaft such as a small piece of metal. This modification enlarges the tip of the gopher probe and makes probing the surrounding dirt easier.\n- Use the probe to dig into the earth 6 to 12 inches deep, approximately 8 to 12 inches on the opposite side of the hole or plugged opening of the mound. This will help you to locate the active tunnels off of the main gopher burrow. When you locate the main burrow, you will notice a sudden drop of the probe of approximately two inches. This is a great sign that you have discovered the gopher tunnel.\n- Keep poking around until you find the main burrow. This can require patience. However, once you have located the tunnel, you will have access to the best tunnels to set your gopher traps.\nSelecting a Gopher Trap\nThere are several different types of gopher traps available on the market. The most common types of traps used for gopher control are the two-pronged pincer-style traps and the choker-style box trap. Popular brands include Macabee, Cinch, Gophinator and Victor.\nGopher trap manufacturers often provide detailed instructions, which should be followed carefully.\nAs gopher traps are fairly expensive, people often choose to only buy one. One gopher trap may very well solve the problem, but increasing the number of gopher traps used can greatly impact the speed and overall success of your gopher trapping program.\nHow to Set a Macabee Pincer-Style Gopher Trap:\nPincer traps are best when set in one of the pocket gopher’s feeding tunnels. Feeding tunnels usually span anywhere from one to twelve inches underground. The Macabee pincer trap is a pocket gopher trap that allows you to dig into an active tunnel to place the trap directly into the gopher tunnel.\nThe following steps should be taken:\n- Swing trigger wire up from under frame.\n- Spread jaws, using thumbs, by pushing up downward.\n- Use left index finger to guide trigger wire hook over the end of the frame.\n- Continuing to push down on the frame, place the straight end of the trigger wire through the small in hole on the silver plate.\n- Place the set trap into the pocket gopher hole.\nAdditional Pocket Gopher Trapping Notes:\n- Use shovels or garden trowels to open gopher tunnels wide enough to set gopher traps in pairs. Such gopher traps placed in pairs should face opposite directions. This method of trapping increases success as it threatens the gopher from two directions. Nevertheless, only using one gopher trap will not compromise your gopher trapping system.\n- Most gopher tunnels will have a circumference of roughly three to four inches allowing the use of pincer traps. Should you find that your pincer style traps do not fit within the tunnels and you are not comfortable further modifying the tunnel, the box style trap will likely be the optimum solution.\n- It is not necessary to bait gopher traps although different professionals claim that baiting yields better results. Should you want to bait your gopher trap, try applying peanut butter, alfalfa greens, carrots or lettuce. A yard mole poison (or talprid poison) could even be used.\n- Last, but not least, be sure to exclude all light from the tunnel after setting your gopher trap or traps. There have yet to be scientific studies conducted to determine whether this last step is absolutely crucial. Nonetheless, we at Gopher and Mole Control HQ believe re-covering the rigged tunnels provides for the best results. You can cover tunnels by laying plywood over the openings or by covering with dirt clogs.\nTo find out more information and resources about gopher control, continue reading here at the Gopher and Mole Control HQ Learning Center.']	['<urn:uuid:cf53abe6-8683-4f80-afa8-4c0e10961ffe>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-01T23:21:14.341336	13	39	1545
1071	telerobotic grasping benefits purpose assistive technology	Telerobotic grasping enables faster and easier object manipulation through intention recognition and assistance, while assistive technology's broader purpose is to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of people with disabilities, making things possible rather than just easier.	"['Degree Granting Department\nHidden Markov Model, human in the loop, human robot interaction, machine learning, robotics, teleoperation\nIn this dissertation work, a methodology is proposed to enable a robot to identify an object to be grasped and its intended grasp configuration while a human is teleoperating a robot towards the desired object. Based on the detected object and grasp configuration, the human is assisted in the teleoperation task. The environment is unstructured and consists of a number of objects, each with various possible grasp configurations. The identification of the object and the grasp configuration is carried out in real time, by recognizing the intention of the human motion. Simultaneously, the human user is assisted to preshape over the desired grasp configuration. This is done by scaling the components of the remote arm end-effector motion that lead to the desired grasp configuration and simultaneously attenuating the components that are in perpendicular directions. The complete process occurs while manipulating the master device and without having to interact with another interface.\nIntention recognition from motion is carried out by using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) theory. First, the objects are classified based on their shapes. Then, the grasp configurations are preselected for each object class. The selection of grasp configurations is based on the human knowledge of robust grasps for the various shapes. Next, an HMM for each object class is trained by having a skilled teleoperator perform repeated preshape trials over each grasp configuration of the object class in consideration. The grasp configurations are modeled as the states of each HMM whereas the projections of translation and orientation vectors, over each reference vector, are modeled as observations. The reference vectors are the ideal translation and rotation trajectories that lead the remote arm end-effector towards a grasp configuration. During an actual grasping task performed by a novice or a skilled user, the trained model is used to detect their intention. The output probability of the HMM associated with each object in the environment is computed as the user is teleoperating towards the desired object. The object that is associated with the HMM which has the highest output probability, is taken as the desired object. The most likely Viterbi state sequence of the selected HMM gives the desired grasp configuration. Since an HMM is associated with every object, objects can be shuffled around, added or removed from the environment without the need to retrain the models. In other words, the HMM for each object class needs to be trained only once by a skilled teleoperator.\nThe intention recognition algorithm was validated by having novice users, as well as the skilled teleoperator, grasp objects with different grasp configurations from a dishwasher rack. Each object had various possible grasp configurations. The proposed algorithm was able to successfully detect the operator\'s intention and identify the object and the grasp configuration of interest. This methodology of grasping was also compared with unassisted mode and maximum-projection mode. In the unassisted mode, the operator teleoperated the arm without any assistance or intention recognition. In the maximum-projection mode, the maximum projection of the motion vectors was used to determine the intended object and the grasp configuration of interest. Six healthy and one wheelchair-bound individuals, each executed twelve pick-and-place trials in intention-based assisted mode and unassisted mode. In these trials, they picked up utensils from the dishwasher and laid them on a table located next to it. The relative positions and orientations of the utensils were changed at the end of every third trial. It was observed that the subjects were able to pick-and-place the objects 51% faster and with less number of movements, using the proposed method compared to the unassisted method. They found it much easier to execute the task using the proposed method and experienced less mental and overall workloads. Two able-bodied subjects also executed three preshape trials over three objects in intention-based assisted and maximum projection mode. For one of the subjects, the objects were shuffled at the end of the six trials and she was asked to carry out three more preshape trials in the two modes. This time, however, the subject was made to change their intention when she was about to preshape to the grasp configurations. It was observed that intention recognition was consistently accurate through the trajectory in the intention-based assisted method except at a few points. However, in the maximum-projection method the intention recognition was consistently inaccurate and fluctuated. This often caused to subject to be assisted in the wring directions and led to extreme frustration. The intention-based assisted method was faster and had less hand movements. The accuracy of the intention based method did not change when the objects were shuffled. It was also shown that the model for intention recognition can be trained by a skilled teleoperator and be used by a novice user to efficiently execute a grasping task in teleoperation.\nScholar Commons Citation\nKhokar, Karan Hariharan, ""Human Intention Recognition Based Assisted Telerobotic Grasping of Objects in an Unstructured Environment"" (2013). Graduate Theses and Dissertations.', 'What is Assistive Technology?\nAssistive technology (AT) is any product, equipment, software program and/or system that enhances learning, working, and daily living for persons with disabilities. The goal of assistive technology is to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of people with disabilities (ATIA).\nBasically, AT enables independence and function for people with different abilities. There’s an often-re-quoted statement that I often use to explain why technology with a defined purpose is so life-changing for people with disabilities:\n“For most of us, technology makes things easier. For a person with a disability, it makes things possible.”\nAssistive technology makes things possible. We all benefit from technology but people with disabilities may require technology to participate, show what they know, or be more independent!\nWho Conducts an Assistive Technology Evaluation?\nSo, you know you have the need to consider assistive technology - maybe your “why” is due to motor, visual, auditory, cognitive, language, or social-emotional difficulties that limit your abilities. Before you identify the appropriate assistive technology tools, it is important to thoroughly explore all of the factors related to why you are looking at AT in the first place! That’s when you consult an assistive technology evaluator.\nAn assistive technology evaluation is typically conducted by an Assistive Technology Practitioner (ATP), AT Specialist, or AT Consultant. The last two terms are not regulated by licensure or credentialing so requesting additional information about the evaluator’s background and training is important to better frame their level of expertise in regards to what you’ll need out of an AT evaluation. Some AT specialists or consultants are clinicians with backgrounds in other areas like speech and language therapists, special education teachers, or occupational therapists who have additional training in assistive technology.\nClinicians who are designated as Assistive Technology Practitioners, or ATP, have demonstrated competency with the clinical standards set forth by the Rehabilitation Engineering & Assistive Technology Society of North America (RESNA). Along with this competency comes expectations for professional development to keep current on AT trends, product innovations, and research supported interventions. ATPs can also be OT, speech, special education, or rehabilitation-based clinicians.\nRegardless of whether you find an ATP, AT Specialist, or AT Consultant who does assistive technology evaluations in your area, it is important to know your “why” and to find an evaluator whose expertise matches your needs. Some AT evaluators are specialists in mobility, seating and positioning, communication, access and design, educational AT applications, and/or sensory systems (vision, hearing). You wouldn’t see your ophthalmologist for tooth pain, so make sure you select your AT evaluator with an idea of the problem in mind - and whether or not they have the skills to help you!\nWhat is an Assistive Technology Evaluation?\nA thorough assistive technology evaluation will take a holistic, team approach throughout the process. Assistive technology services do not end when the evaluation report is submitted, so the input and collaborative approach to the evaluation helps to define meaningful goals and appropriate tools and services needed. An AT evaluation can include input from doctors, teachers, speech therapists, rehabilitation engineers, OT’s, and other related specialists - all of their data and expertise helps to form a complete picture of the person, his/her strengths, and barriers to independence or performance.\nThere are a few frameworks that advise the AT evaluation process - for more information, read this article here. The person’s needs and skills should advise the selection of the appropriate evaluation tool so regardless of what framework is used, AT evaluations are comprehensive in identifying the person’s strengths, weaknesses/barriers to performance, needs, environments, tasks, and routines. An evaluation may or may not include additional assessments for related skills such as language or motor skills testing (depending on the evaluator’s expertise and file review history).\nOnly after the data has been collected, observations and AT trials completed, and thorough evaluation process completed, does the conversation about specific assistive technology tools happen. The recommended AT tools should be specific to the student’s abilities, needs, tasks, and environments where the AT tools are being used.\nAssistive Technology Tools\nIt’s impossible to list all of the tools that can be characterized as assistive technology. It’s best to think of it in terms of the quote mentioned above: is it necessary for one or is it beneficial to all?\nAn example of this is a trampoline in a preschool classroom. You wouldn’t look at the trampoline as being out of place in the classroom - little ones all enjoy jumping and it helps them to get the wiggles out! All children in the class are benefitting from the movement opportunities that the trampoline provides. However, that same trampoline may be the equipment that allows one little boy to self-regulate in order to complete tasks at the table with his peers, or join his peers sitting on the carpet for a class lesson. In this case, the trampoline is his AT tool and without it in his classroom, the little boy would not be successful in managing his self-regulation needs.\nWhen you consider that example, the possibilities for what may enable function for a person with disabilities could potentially be endless. So, here’s what you need to know about assistive technology tools:\nAT tools can range from low tech to high tech\n(i.e. pencil grip, reading window, adapted spoon versus computer-based software, voice-output device, motorized wheelchair)\nAT tools can be off-the-shelf products or customized to meet individual needs.\nThe AT tools selected should match the needs, tasks, skills, and priorities/goals of the person using the assistive technology.\nMore than one assistive technology tool may be recommended!\nMore Resources on Assistive Technology\nKnow your “why” in exploring assistive technology and check out some of these additional resources for finding AT specialists, exploring exciting products, and reviewing new research. The field of assistive technology is comprised of innovative professionals who are dedicated to maximizing the independence and capacity of people of all abilities!\nRESNA - Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America AOTA - American Occupational Therapy Association ASHA - American Speech and Hearing Association CEC - Council for Exceptional Children']"	['<urn:uuid:ef42eb51-cf16-40e6-bb6e-856b3d7648ac>', '<urn:uuid:e8ba5889-eead-4f6e-8c34-67a1d7674565>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-02T10:56:22.807332	6	37	1849
458	How did ancient leaders die while defending their lands?	Two ancient leaders died defending their territories in different ways. In Egypt, King Seqenenre Tao II was killed in battle against the Hyksos around 40 years old. CT scans revealed he was captured with his hands tied behind his back and executed by multiple attackers using different weapons like axes, spears, and daggers. In biblical times, Aaron died on Mount Hor after being stripped of his priestly robe, which was given to his son Eleazar, as punishment for disobeying God at Meribah.	"[""Water from a Rock 20 1The people of Israel arrived at the Zin Desert during the first month[F] and set up camp near the town of Kadesh. It was there that Miriam died and was buried. 2 The Israelites had no water, so they went to Moses and Aaron 3and complained, “Moses, we'd be better off if we had died along with the others in front of the LORD's sacred tent.[G] 4You brought us into this desert, and now we and our livestock are going to die! 5Egypt was better than this horrible place. At least there we had grain and figs and grapevines and pomegranates.[H] But now we don't even have any water.” 6Moses and Aaron went to the entrance to the sacred tent, where they bowed down. The LORD appeared to them in all of his glory 787-8and said, “Moses, get your walking stick.[I] Then you and Aaron call the people together and command that rock to give you water. That's how you will provide water for the people of Israel and their livestock.” 9Moses obeyed and took his stick from the sacred tent. 10After he and Aaron had gathered the people around the rock, he said, “Look, you rebellious people, and you will see water flow from this rock!” 11 He raised his stick in the air and struck the rock two times. At once, water gushed from the rock, and the people and their livestock had water to drink. 12But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you refused to believe in my power, these people did not respect me. And so, you will not be the ones to lead them into the land I have promised.” 13The Israelites had complained against the LORD, and he had shown them his holy power by giving them water to drink. So they named the place Meribah, which means “Complaining.” Israel Isn't Allowed To Go through Edom 14Moses sent messengers from Israel's camp near Kadesh with this message for the king of Edom: We are Israelites, your own relatives, and we're sure you have heard the terrible things that have happened to us. 15Our ancestors settled in Egypt and lived there a long time. But later the Egyptians were cruel to us, 16and when we begged our LORD for help, he answered our prayer and brought us out of that land. Now we are camped at the border of your territory, near the town of Kadesh. 17Please let us go through your country. We won't go near your fields or vineyards, and we won't drink any water from your wells. We will stay on the main road[J] until we leave your territory. 18But the king of Edom answered, “No, I won't let you go through our country! And if you try, we will attack you.” 19Moses sent back this message: “We promise to stay on the main road, and if any of us or our livestock drink your water, we will pay for it. We just want to pass through.” 20But the king insisted, “You can't go through our land!” Then Edom sent out its strongest troops 21to keep Israel from passing through its territory. So the Israelites had to go in another direction. Aaron Dies 22After the Israelites had left Kadesh and had gone as far as Mount Hor 23on the Edomite border, the LORD said, 24“Aaron, this is where you will die. You and Moses disobeyed me at Meribah, and so you will not enter the land I promised the Israelites. 25Moses, go with Aaron and his son Eleazar to the top of the mountain. 26Then take Aaron's priestly robe from him and place it on Eleazar. Aaron will die there.” 27Moses obeyed, and everyone watched as he and Aaron and Eleazar walked to the top of Mount Hor. 28 Moses then took the priestly robe from Aaron and placed it on Eleazar. Aaron died there. When Moses and Eleazar came down, 29the people knew that Aaron had died, and they mourned his death for 30 days.\nContemporary English Version / ©1995 American Bible Society About"", 'CAIRO - 17 February 2021: Renowned Egyptian archaeologist Zahi Hawass posted on his Facebook page a scientific paper on the death of the Egyptian Pharaoh Seqenenre Tao published by Frontiers in Medicine, and carried out by Hawass in cooperation with Sahar Selim, a professor of radiology at the Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University.\nThe study says modern medical technology helped tell the story of an ancient Egyptian king, who died to reunify Egypt in the 16th century BC. It revolves around examining the second mummy of King Seqenenre Tao II by CT scan.\nSeqenenre Tao II, dubbed “The Brave”, ruled southern Egypt during the Hyksos occupation that seized the delta in northern Egypt for a century (1650-1550 BC). His mummy was discovered in the Deir el-Bahari cache in 1881, was examined for the first time at the time, and was studied by X-ray in the 1960s.\nThese examinations indicated that the deceased king had suffered several serious head injuries, but there were no wounds on the rest of the body.\nTheories have differed as to the cause of the king\'s death; some believe that the king was killed in a battle, perhaps at the hands of the Hyksos king himself; others indicate that some may have conspired to kill Seqenenre Tao II while he slept in his palace, and others suggested that the mummification may have been carried out in a hurry far from the royal mummification workshop, in light of the poor condition of the mummy.\nCT scan technique is one of the medical imaging techniques used to, safely and without interference, study archaeological remains, including mummies, which helps maintain them. CT scans helped study many Egyptian royal mummies, determining age at death, gender, and cause of death.\nIn their research, the two Egyptian researchers Zahi Hawass and Sahar Selim presented a new interpretation of the events before and after the death of King Seqenenre Tao II, based on two and three-dimensional CT images that were installed using advanced computer technologies.\nThe deformation of the arms revealed that Seqenenre Tao II was indeed captured on the battlefield, with his hands tied behind his back, which prevented him from repelling the fierce attack to his face.\n""This indicates that Seqenenre Tao II was really on the front line with his soldiers, risking his life to liberate Egypt,"" said Selim.\nA CT scan of the king’s mummy revealed subtle details of the head injuries, including wounds that had not been discovered in previous examinations as they were skillfully hidden by embalmers. The research also included a study of various Hyksos weapons preserved in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, including an ax, spear and several daggers, which showed compatibility with the wounds of Seqenenre Tao II.\nThe results indicate that Seqenenre Tao II was killed by several Hyksos attackers who surrounded him from different angles and with different weapons. His killing appears as a ceremonial execution.\nFurthermore, the CT scan determined that Seqenenre Tao II was about 40 years old at the time of his death, based on the shape of the bones detected in the images, providing the most accurate estimate so far.\nThis study provides important details about a pivotal point in Egypt\'s long history.\nIn a painting known as the Carnavaron stela, found in the Theban Temple at Karnak, the battles the son of Seqenenre Tao II fought against the Hyksos are recorded. Seqenenre Tao II’s son, Camus, fell a martyr during the war against the Hyksos, and Ahmose, the second son of Seqenenre Tao II, was the one who completed the expulsion of the Hyksos.\nHe fought them, defeated them and chased them to what is known as Gaza today (Palestine). He also succeeded in unifying Egypt.']"	['<urn:uuid:e7ee0b9f-b0de-497b-bdad-b120cdd4c11b>', '<urn:uuid:63329205-7d18-4e31-9ccb-bf028f0cc7df>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-01T22:47:46.423955	9	82	1299
667	I'm trying to understand weather impacts on my outdoor retail business - is there any way to show weather data alongside my sales information on a map?	Yes, using the custom tile layer feature in Azure Maps for Power BI, you can overlay weather data on top of your sales data. For instance, you can display sales data as a bubble layer while showing current weather radar from Azure Maps as a tile layer underneath. This has been demonstrated with a case of sunglass sales, where the visualization clearly showed lower sales occurring in areas experiencing rain.	['The Azure Maps visual for Power BI will be releasing as a preview this week. Power BI is a powerful analysis and visualization tool. Azure Maps is an important tool for gaining geospatial context and insights that can be used in decision making.\nThis initial release includes the following visualization layers:\n- Bubble layer\n- 3D bar chart layer\n- Reference layer\n- Custom tile layer\n- Real-time traffic overlay\nIn addition to these visualization layers, this visual also leverages built-in Power BI features, such as tooltips, color themes, as wells as filter and slicer support.\nBubble layer—represent location data as scaled circles\nBubble layers are a great way to represent location data as scaled circles on the map. Customers can use a linear scaling method or customize the scaling logic using a logarithmic or Cubic-Bezier curve. Additionally, users can pass a value into the legend field and have the fill color of the circles dynamically set; and, outline the circles with a single color or enable the high contrast outline option to have a high contrast variant of the fill color assigned to the circle to help ensure the circles are clearly visible regardless of which style the map is set to. Allowing the user to easily visualize two metrics for each location on the map, scale, and category.\nFor example, the following image shows bicycle accident locations in North Carolina. The color indicates the speed limit of the road the accident occurred on and the size is based on the number of individuals involved in the accident.\n3D bar chart layer—visualize location data as 3D bars or cylinders\n3D bar charts are useful for taking data to the next dimension by allowing visualization of location data as 3D bars or cylinders on the map. Users can tilt and rotate the map by holding down the right mouse button and dragging or use one of the navigation controls to view your data from different perspectives.\nSimilar to the bubble layer, the bar chart later can easily visualize two metrics at the same time using color and relative height. The following map displays store locations with bar heights representing the revenue generated from each location, colored by sales region.\nReference layer—overlay additional data layers to add more context\nPower BI currently allows a single data set to be connected to a visual. However, when working with maps, its often desirable to be able to overlay additional data layers to add more context to a report. With this feature, a GeoJSON file containing custom location data can be uploaded and overlaid on the map. Properties in the GeoJSON file can be used to customize the style of the shapes.\nFor example, the following map image adds a GeoJSON file of census tract boundaries colored by population below a layer of addresses colored by real estate value. This provides insights on how population density is related to property values.\nCustom tile layer—superimpose images on top of Azure Maps base map tiles\nOverlay a custom tile layer on the map to add an additional layer of context. Tile layers allow you to superimpose images on top of Azure Maps base map tiles. Overlay weather data from the Azure Maps weather services or bring your own tile service.\nThe following map displays a bubble layer of sales data of store selling sunglasses above a tile layer showing current weather radar from Azure Maps. In this case, we can easily see that less sales of sunglasses are occurring where it is rain.\nReal-time traffic overlay—see how traffic congestion relates to your data\nUsers can overlay real-time traffic flow data to see how traffic congestion relates to their data. For example, the following map is showing the position of field technicians rendered as a bubble layer on the map colored by their experience level and scaled by the amount of remaining time on their current job. Real-time traffic is overlaid on the map and provides a quick visual reference of which technicians are most likely be delayed getting to their next job due to traffic congestion.\nGet started with the Azure Maps visual for Power BI\nTo get started using the Azure Maps visual, first enable it in the Power BI desktop app. To do this, open the options panel though File > Options and settings. Go to the Preview features options and select the Azure Maps visual. Once this is done you will also be able to use this visual in the Power BI website.\nThis is just the beginning! We have lots of exciting new features planned. Have a feature request? Let us know or vote for an existing request on our feedback site.\nLearn more about the Azure Maps Power BI visual.']	['<urn:uuid:99f31d40-0a04-42f9-9945-3b39436ed55c>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-01T23:21:14.341336	27	70	789
459	Which is older, Levittown suburb or the Delaware Aqueduct bridge?	The Delaware Aqueduct bridge is older, having been built in 1849, while Levittown was completed in 1951. The Delaware Aqueduct is actually the oldest wire suspension bridge in the United States, designed by John Augustus Roebling who later engineered the Brooklyn Bridge. Levittown, on Long Island, is considered the nation's first true suburb.	"['Action Speaks!, the panel discussion series at Providence art space AS220, wraps up its fall run with a look at the American adventure in suburbia.\nParticipants will consider the effect of suburban growth on our economy and culture and address some pressing questions: Can the suburbs, built on what once seemed an end-less supply of oil, turn green? Can bastions of “white flight” reflect the nation’s growing diversity?\nAction Speaks! discussions, produced by Cheryl Kaminsky and moderated by Marc Levitt, use an underappreciated date in history as a springboard for chatter on contemporary affairs. This time it’s 1951 and the completion of Levittown (in photo), a Long Island community widely considered the nation’s first true suburb.\nThe event, scheduled for October 28 at 5 pm at AS220, 115 Empire Street, is free and open to the public.\nPanelists will include V. Elaine Gross, president of ERASE Racism, a Long Island-based non-profit that promotes racial equity through research, policy advocacy and education; Alyssa Katz, a freelance journalist who teaches at New York University and author of Our Lot: How Real Estate Came to Own Us; and Paul Lukez, a Boston-based architect and author of Suburban Transfor-mations.\nWe caught up with Lukez for a Q&A via e-mail. Answers are edited and condensed for length.\nYOU SUGGEST, IN SUBURBAN TRANSFORMATIONS, THAT WE SHOULD BUILD ON WHAT WE HAVE IN SUBURBIA RATHER THAN START ANEW — AND ERASE HISTORY — WITH EACH SUCCESSIVE DEVELOPMENT. WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?\nThere are several reasons for selectively and intelligently transforming suburbs instead of erasing them completely.\nFirst, it is often more sustainable to reuse or transform existing buildings (their materials and systems) than to send them to the landfill. In fact, we should be building struc-tures that will last for 100 years-plus, but are designed to accommodate changing users’ needs over time. There are many examples of such structures. Boston’s Quincy Market is a great example of a building that has survived for two hundred years because of its adaptable design. Its façade and floor plans were continually changed over its life before being “historically restored” in 1976.\nSecondly, we don’t have to tear all the buildings in the suburbs down to improve the quality of spaces and environment. Many mistakes were made in the original design of suburbs. Buildings were often placed in the wrong place relative to the street and adjacent buildings. By reconstituting the scarred landscape, improving the roads/infrastructure and thoughtfully adding new structures, a denser suburb integrated with nature can evolve over time, repairing many of the mistakes of the past.\nThirdly, leaving traces of past buildings and urban interventions adds a unique quality to a community that cannot be replicated by other communities. Because the way in which each community is transformed will be the result of time and circumstance. If each community erases all traces of its past, each community will tend to look the same. At the end of his life, psychiatrist Carl Jung looked at his house on Lake Zurich which he had built over his adult life, transforming its original tower-like structure over time through multiple additions and transformations. He recognized in the idiosyncratic transformations the structure of his life, one that could not be replicated. Embracing idiosyncrasy and circumstance can contribute to creating a unique identity for each community.\nAnd finally, we can’t afford to tear down our suburbs and start over. We need to make the most of what we have, which in turn can yield surprising and inventive results.\n: This Just In\n, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Urban Planning, New York University, More', ""Two hours southwest of Hudson, on the New York-Pennsylvania line, lies one of the most remarkable bridges found anywhere. Somehow, I hadn't heard of the Delaware Aqueduct, the oldest wire suspension bridge in the United States, until a couple months ago. It was designed by John Augustus Roebling, the engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge. But as remarkable as the Brooklyn Bridge is, the Delaware Aqueduct might be more amazing.\n|The aqueduct carries vehicular traffic today.|\nThe aqueduct was built in 1849 as an improvement to the earlier, 106-mile long Delaware-Hudson Canal. The privately financed canal had been completed in 1828 to carry coal from northeastern Pennsylvania to the Hudson River at Kingston, New York. Most of the coal apparently continued to New York City via the Hudson River, helping fuel the city's growth. I haven't yet grasped the canal's whole story (... e.g., why such a circuitous route to NYC?!), but apparently boat traffic on the canal originally crossed the Delaware River via the river itself. I'm guessing the canal boats were lowered via locks, floated across the river, and raised again to continue on their way. In any event, the canal traffic had to negotiate commercial timbers being floated down the river, presenting not only an inconvenience but a danger. Hence, the Delaware Aqueduct was built to carry the canal and its boats over the river.\nRunning an artificial waterway over a river strikes me as a pretty cool thing; doing it with a suspension structure is even cooler. And the suspension system is extraordinary, as the main cables are so low in profile as to be contained almost entirely within the height of the cross trusses. An unobservant passerby might mistake the very complex structural system for something simpler. Here's a cutaway view showing how it works:\n|The canal as originally designed and constructed in 1849|\n|One of the approximately 80 cross trusses|\nEventually, the commercial viability of the canal was superseded by rail. The canal was abandoned and filled, and the aqueduct was decommissioned in 1898. The aqueduct was then purchased by a local businessman who removed the canal side walls and the upper tow paths (thus exposing the cables) and installed a vehicular roadway. He used his new bridge to transport timber from his forests in New York to the rail lines in Pennsylvania. He allowed the public to use the bridge for a fee, payable at a new toll house built on the New York side. Several generations of toll keepers lived in the house until the 1970s.\n|The original road conversion|\n|The current roadway with the canal sides restored|\nThe bridge doesn't get a lot of traffic. In the 45 minutes I was there, about six cars crossed. It's probably busier during vacation season. But driving and walking across it are unique experiences. The one lane roadway is tightly framed by the canal sidewalls, creating a tunnel effect for drivers. Crossing on foot, on the old tow paths, gives the pedestrian a bird's eye view of the river as well as the roadway 9 feet below. Here's a video showing what it's like to drive across the bridge.\nI'm hoping to visit it again soon... perhaps via a raft ride next time.""]"	['<urn:uuid:c4b31098-c16b-4981-a3c7-4dae9d9a00be>', '<urn:uuid:dae4cb51-6892-4294-89d7-b258a2e76d38>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-01T22:47:46.423955	10	53	1137
710	Between Foster's Beijing airport and Creative Group's Goa terminal, which has the bolder roof design?	Foster & Partners' Beijing airport has a more ambitious roof design, being the world's biggest building under one roof when completed in 2008. In comparison, Goa's terminal features a simpler semi-circular design with a half arch and steel portal frames, though it does incorporate an iconic wave-like solid roof with skylights.	['Listen to this article\nAt a press conference earlier this year, listening to architect Luis Vidal talk about his design for Heathrow’s new £2.5bn Terminal 2, I heard the word “destination” and my nerves began to jangle. Vidal suggested that this was a new generation of airport, that this was a “gathering place”, a “piazza”, a place people would want to come to whether they were flying or not. He compared the amount of retail space with Covent Garden. By now my teeth were grinding and I wanted to scream: who the hell wants to spend any more time in an airport than they have to?\nBy the following day I’d calmed down. After all, I thought, airport architects face an invidious conundrum. They are designing a building type that, like a prison, no matter how luxuriously appointed, everyone wants to escape as soon as possible.\nAs long ago as the 1960s, the French cultural theorist Paul Virilio suggested that the airport concourse would replace the city square as the fundamental site of urban and international interchange. It hasn’t. Few meetings take place in airports. Instead people flying in for even a few hours make great efforts to get away from them – even if it entails hours in traffic or an anonymous airport hotel. People dislike being in airports. And the more they travel, the more they dislike them.\nWhich gives everyone designing one a problem. All the carefully wrought metaphors of wings and flight, the great curving roofs mirroring the landscape, the views of planes and sky and the intuitive way-finding don’t really matter because, ultimately, they all end up feeling pretty much the same anyway.\nPartly this disillusion with the airport as a building type is due to the rapid transformation of flight over the past half-century from exotic treat to everyday annoyance – airports are victims of their own success. A big chunk of the problem is the process of being processed, the small humiliations of exposing your toiletries, of standing beltless in your socks being patted down, the queues, the nagging fear of missing your flight, the overpriced, overfamiliar products in shops which can only survive because they have a captive market comforted by the soothingly familiar act of consumption.\nPartly, though, it is also due to the increasingly ubiquitous architectural language which effectively disorients us, desensitising us to where we are. And that is something that architects could control. There is an assumption that glass walls, soaring roofs, stainless steel details and terrazzo floors are the de facto finish for the modern airport. But are they? Why? Why do airports need to look like malls?\nThe question, then, is what should architects do? Should they just design the most functional, well-engineered spaces possible? Should they attempt to design impressive gateways embodying national pride? Or should they be doing something else entirely?\nA slew of airport openings and newly commissioned designs should allow us to take the temperature of the genre, to detect emerging trends.\nOne rather elegant type is what we might call “airport orientalism”. Just as it was in art, orientalism is chiefly an invention of the Occident (pace Edward Said) and mostly then the British, who have managed an incredible dominance of international airport design. Leading that charge is London-based architectural practice Foster & Partners, which started with Stansted, in Essex, and ended with world domination – almost. Its Beijing international airport in particular is an extraordinary structure. When it was completed in 2008, it was the world’s biggest building under one roof.\nLast year the firm completed Jordan’s lovely Queen Alia airport, a cool space beneath a roofscape of domed parasols, a space somehow simultaneously shaded and perfectly naturally lit. The same architects’ designs for Kuwait international airport feature elegant concrete vaults, a blend of Grand Central Station’s Roman arches, a Middle Eastern bazaar and Eero Saarinen’s expressionist concrete at JFK’s 1960s TWA terminal.\nAnother British architect, Sir Nicholas Grimshaw, recently released designs for Istanbul’s new six-runway airport (due to open in 2018 and destined to be the world’s largest terminal under one roof). Here, slender concrete columns support a series of filigree vaults, vaguely Islamic and very elegant.\nGrimshaw has also designed the delicate golden origami roofs of St Petersburg’s Pulkovo airport which opened earlier this year; glittering oligarch bling toned down – just enough.\nAlongside airport orientalism is the space age, another emerging oeuvre (taking its cue from a 1960s techno-futurism). On top of the heap is Italian architect Massimiliano Fuksas’s astonishing Shenzhen Bao’an airport. A set of perforated tubes, the structure creates a mind-bending landscape, something strikingly unfamiliar. Skidmore, Owings & Merrill’s new sci-fi Terminal 2 at Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji international airport, with its Mughal mushroom columns and waffle roof, does something similar, if a little more conventionally.\nPossibly most impressive of all, however, is the weird and wonderful world of Georgia’s aesthetically integrated transport infrastructure. Here almost the whole caboodle has been entrusted to German architect J Mayer H. Everything from border crossings to motorway service stations have been turned into opportunities for audacious national branding. Mestia’s Queen Tamar airport might be a tiddler, with its terminal building bent upwards like a paper clip to create a viewing tower, but it is also a symbol of a country that is using airports – and everything else it builds – to signal an identity.\nDutch architect UNStudio was also brought in and its design for the red-and-white Kutaisi international airport, with its folded planes and bulging fractal ceiling, is anything but conventional.\nPerhaps the most intriguing recent airport story has been about Berlin’s disused Tempelhof, which had become so beloved in its overgrown state that plans to redevelop it were thrown out and its runways will now be turned into a public park.\nFirst built in 1923 and rebuilt in its present form by the Nazis in 1934, it is a rare survivor of the era. Designed in the shape of an eagle (already a heavy piece of symbolism), Tempelhof has a fiercely charged history, as the site of the 1948 Berlin airlift. Its form is that cold yet also rather elegant blend of art deco, modernism and classicism that characterised the Nazi era, a cocktail of limestone, marble and brass. A huge curving canopy sweeps passengers in (this is Foster’s favourite airport and he copied this gesture in Beijing). It had the mass, articulation and permanence of a city station, a place always alive and as solid as the city itself, of which it was determinedly a part.\nThis old-fashioned airport was, despite its history, hugely popular. Why? In part because it was merely a few minutes from the city centre, so the building felt part of the urban fabric. But it was also that its architecture gave it a scale related to the city, and its materials reassured with their familiarity and a sense of calm (if rather formal) permanence. It was the architecture of the museum and not the mall, a place that reassured and inculcated a sense of place, which allowed travellers to locate themselves somewhere specific (albeit many travellers might not want to locate themselves in Nazi Germany). Only a handful of other airports have done something similar as successfully, such as Budapest’s now-defunct Ferihegy 1 and Copenhagen’s beautiful timber-encased airport.\nIn the 1930s there were all kinds of proposals for city-centre airports. One was proposed over London’s King’s Cross station and it was envisaged that airships would dock on the crowns of New York skyscrapers. Now it seems that airports will never return to the city centre (though cities are growing outwards to meet them).\nPerhaps, however, architects, engineers and airport authorities need to stop thinking in the language of the generic and instead build airports as if they were embedded elements of the metropolis, as grand and solid as the stations once were, buildings scaled to city streets and civic architecture rather than to the blank expanse of runways or to the mega-malls they increasingly resemble.\nEdwin Heathcote is the FT’s architecture critic\nWhere waiting for a flight is fun\nSauna From August, passengers at Helsinki airport will be able to enjoy a classically Finnish treat while waiting to leave the country, writes Kasia Delgado. Finnair is due to open a unisex sauna in its new business class lounge, as well as private showers. Although Finns traditionally go nude, towels are provided, along with Finnish forest berry-based shampoos and lotions. Other airlines’ passengers can pay €48 to use the sauna.\nGolf Seoul’s Incheon airport has an 18-hole golf course five minutes away – a free shuttle bus connects it to the terminal. But for those in a hurry, there’s also a “golf town” within the airport boundaries, offering a 330-yard driving range and 18-hole putting course. Hong Kong International also has a nine-hole course between Terminal 2 and the Marriott airport hotel. Hole seven of the Nine Eagles course even features a green on an island in a man-made lake.\nSwimming Numerous airport-perimeter hotels offer pools, and there’s one inside the airside G-Force health club at Dubai International, but Singapore’s Changi airport is in a different league. It boasts a Balinese-themed pool on the roof of Terminal 1, with a whirlpool, cabana beds, a poolside bar and views over the apron. Entry costs S$13.91 (£6.50).\nArt Airports often feature work by local artists, but Amsterdam’s Schiphol offers a rather more highbrow take, with an airside offshoot of the city’s celebrated Rijksmuseum. It is currently closed as the airport is refurbished but an improved version is due to reopen next year. Meanwhile Terminal 2E at Paris’s Charles de Gaulle airport has an Espace Musées which displays a revolving collection from some of the city’s best galleries and museums. It is currently showing 17th-century tapestries and furniture. Both are free.\nIce skating For those who still have energy left after their round of golf, Seoul’s Incheon airport also offers the Ice Forest skating rink. Skate hire costs Won4,000 (£2.30).\nPhotographs: Corbis; LHR Airports Limited; Getty; Nigel Young; Nakanimamasakhlisi; AFP; Reuters; Robert Polidori; Nakanimamasakhlisi; Nigel Young; Marcus Buck; AFP; Yuri Molodkovets; LHR Airports Ltd\nGet alerts on Travel when a new story is published', 'Modern and Bold Designs of Airports in India\nDesigning an airport is a complex task – while symbolically the designs need to embody the city’s and country’s identity by acting as the first and last handshake; the key factors of the sensitive nature and security concerns of airports also have to painstakingly taken in consideration in the designs. In recent times with terror attacks hounding the country, Airport designing has become all the more critical and vital.\nAirport designing for any city also leads to the enhancement and development of the city, what with metro links/stations and retail centres planned around them. Sites for such projects have to bear in mind the proximity to existing highways, to possess a location away from the hub of the city due to security factors and the availability of such a huge expanse of land. With the escalating air traffic in India, a number of airports are looking to expand or set up new terminals to accommodate the growing number of passengers. A look at the new modern and bold forms of airports with imposing roof structures and you realise that India’s coming of age.\nDelhi based Architect Charanjit S Shah apart from adorning the very famous hat of being the creator of ‘The Indian Time Savers Standard’ has been credited with highly acclaimed architectural projects practiced under his 41 years old firm Creative Group. The firm takes a special interest in green initiatives in architecture and works on diverse projects related to Architecture, Planning, Urban Design, Structural Design, Interiors, Project Management & Valuation. The firm has won a lot of design competitions, four of them being major airports of India – Chennai, Goa, Vadodara and Raipur. Prof Shah, a widely travelled architect while admitting that Modern Airport Designs in India imitate the western world designs, cites his favourite approach to airport designing as ‘transparency and a simplistic approach for proper functionality of the building’.\nCreative Group collaborates with New York based Frederic Schwartz & Associates as the global partner for all their Joint venture projects and the Chennai and Vadodara airport projects have been the outcome of their collaborations along with Gensler – a global architecture, design, planning and consulting firm.\nOn airport designing Prof Shah adds, “Besides aesthetics, it is thefunctionality of the building which is very important and involves the proper segregation of visitors, passengers and the baggage system. As one has to stay for a longer period in hold areas, queuing immigration and check in areas, proper care is desired for providing good visual effect within the building. Minimizing heat gain and maximizing day light through passive strategies of good planning should be emphasized while designing Airport Terminal Buildings.”\nOn design constraints he mentions the redevelopment of such airports on the existing premises and the limitation of site areas available on city side developments as challenges. Lighting forms an important part of such projects as besides the day factor, it is the night illumination which is of utmost importance too. In these following airports, the architect has used a combination of local and international light fixtures which besides optimizing the count of the fixtures also increase the illumination outputs. “Lighting typology and patterns have been carefully selected to define different public spaces without any physical segregation. Even though it is a wide known fact that the terminals by virtue oftheir nature are energy guzzlers, but with due diligence the lighting power load has been kept to 1W/sqft in most of the areas,” informs Architect Shah. This has been done by using CFL’s andT5 in all the areas and metal halides in combination with CFL’s for high ceiling areas.\nWhile designing airports, one has to understand that the design needs to be in regional as well as global context- a challenging combination to conceive and execute. The mantra definitely is to think globally and to act locally. Discourses still exist to which Prof Shah explains, “In today’s global context and keeping in the overall international trend of Airport Planning, modern large span steel structures have overshadowed the ethnic/ heritage buildings. Heritage does play a vital role and goes with the overall vocabulary of the city development but technological advancement has overpowered it. Contemporary designs are well suited and are in line with public’s aspirations.” Admirably, in all the airports that Creative Group are designing, while elements have been taken out of the regional character of the cities, the execution and technology adapted produce the outcome fitting for the global context.\nNo doubt, Chennai is the most enthusiastic city in India when it comes to practicing green architecture. In the same line, the Chennai airport is going to be the first green airport in the world. The brief of the design in Phase 1 included a domestic terminal, extension of the existing international terminal and associated departure flyover. Phase 2 will include face-lifting of existing terminals, multilevel car park, metro stations and city side development.\n|ARIAL VIEW of Chennai domestic terminal|\nA 1700sqm central green spine comprising two green courtyards acts as the fulcrum around which the H shaped domestic terminal building evolves. Divided into two halves, the first half of the building is into the landside while the other half is into airside programmed operations related spaces (connected with a central security checkpoint for departure), and has two elliptical glass tubes on either side of the building for arriving passengers (which will connect the landside with the airside operations though the Central Courtyard).\nThe beautiful landscaping of the courtyards with tall palm groves, colourful indigenous plantings, shallow pools and vertical garden infuses freshness into the building inducing an exterior-interior dialogue. The airport is the first in the world to have gardens visible throughout the terminals. The terminal has a dramatic hovering wing like roof in tubular steel truss (37m high and 30m wide) with a cantilever of 24m – the largest in any airport building previously. The 260m long column free structure revelling in the glass curtain walls and skylights add to the spaciousness. A precast elevated departure flyover is supported on 76 ‘V’ columns and visually demarcates the departure lounge on the upper level from the arrival lounge on the lower level.\nThis sustainable green airport called for an extensive research of materials. The parking area is totally devoid of hard surface which has 95% of water runoff and no percolation. Use of Green pavers (Polypropylene Pavers) with over 90% porosity recharges the ground water that is the cause of immense concern, with water table dropping every year. Bricks have been replaced with AAC blocks (Aerated Autoclaved Concrete Blocks) which ensure thermal insulation. Sustainability aspects further include restoration of the native landscape, passive energy conservation strategies, material selection, onsite storm water detention, on site waste water treatment and dispersal systems. A parking garage with a green roof will create what the designers describe as a “green gate” to the terminal.\nAmongst other unique features are a vertical garden (a stainless steel structure lattice providing support for hanging plantings with vibrantly coloured lush vegetation) which will be visible in the inner green spine while passing through the arrival glass tube.\nThe Creative Group was awarded the Goa Integrated Terminal Building at Dabolim which they like to term as ‘The Wave’ that thematically denotes the ‘aspirations of a nation which is quickly becoming a technological and economic giant in the global platform’. Simultaneously, it represents the freedom that Goa is basking in, in being a global tourist hub. ‘The Wave’ is also emblematic of ecstasy – the ecstasy which no individual visiting Goa can miss. Eventually, it represents the city known for its sea and beaches and also symbolises the site location that is surrounded by sea on one side.\nWith Goa being a favourite tourist hub, the challenge was to have an airport building catering to various needs including chartered and civil flights, which was overcome by making the terminal flexible in terms of integration of both international and domestic passengers.\nThe form has been derived from a circle where the terminal forms a semi-circle resting on ground with a half arch emerging from one end of the semi-circle. With a bold, sleek, transparent and iconic form, the design of the airport successfully captures the vibrancy of the Goan spirit. Steel portal frames constituting the basic building envelope (leading to column free interior spaces) convey a bold look. The long curved glass facades (of a specially made double glass unit providing thermal and sound insulation with a protective blue tinge film reflecting the water proximity) and a free flowing form of solid roof (with skylights) resembling a wave make the structure iconic. A large overhang covering the kerb achieves natural light through the sun breaking louvers.\nThe vibrant interiors include specially designed types of glasses, back lit double height feature walls near the escalators and staircase (aiding in directing the vertical flow of passengers), texture granite stone flooring, wall hangings and sculptures (representing the Goan flavour) and wall cladding of Compact Laminated panels (a recyclable green material).\nTo fight the limited scope of expansion, the terminal has been designed to accommodate maximum built up area for limited ground coverage by introducing more floor slabs in the same volume, making it economically more efficient. Also through the planning of service equipment in the basement and their cooling towers and AHU’s on the open-to-sky mezzanine, saving of space has been done on the main floors. The multi-level parking has been accommodated in the basement.\nA new integrated terminal building has been conceived to aid the handling of passengers and introduce international services with a challenge posed of bringing art into the functionality of the terminal building.\nVadodara having been developed as an industrial hub with the development of automobile, engineering, chemical and other industries, its airport needed to be an ultra modern structure. The airport responds with a single arching, sweeping roof sheltering the North and South sides through 18 m overhangs while wrapping around the east and west side. The archway corresponding to an aerodynamic roof with circular skylights brings in much light apart from that received through the curtain walls on the North and South facades. From a distance, the building is visually nothing short of an ‘aerodynamic volume’ rising above the landscape. The RCC framed structure of the Terminal Building has steel tubular trusses covered with self-supported concealed Galvanized Metal Sheeting standing-seam double skin roofing systems with acoustical treatment and thermal insulation to meet as close to GRIHA/ECBC requirements on noise and echo reduction.\n|View of the Vadodara Airport|\nThe terminal sticks to its green features with ample natural ventilation, a careful implementation of materials in compliance with the ECBC code (AAC blocks, flat seam metal panels concealing the east-west facades, interior finishes of GFRC panels etc).\nThe sub surface car parking for 250 cars enjoys complete view of the terminal from the roadway system. On one hand while the airside and landscape spaces are clearly demarcated, the terminal is connected visually around the central zone in the absence of any partitions. Proper planning has been made to avoid mingling of the domestic and international travellers.\n|Dates of Commencement of Construction|\n|Date of Completion|\n|Chennai||–||Dec 2011 (domestic terminal); Sep 2012\n(International and City Side development)\n|Built Up Areas|\n104.000sqm (Multi Level Car Parking)\nThe emphasis in this integrated passenger terminal for Raipur was not only on the airport’s iconic form, but also in the space modulated to conform to the needs of the passengers to make them most comfortable.\nAn indigenous design with a 3-Dimensional curvilinear roof consisting of 12 trusses (supported by steel ‘tree columns’ with flaring arms) with skylights brings about a floating effect. The organic form has a sliced dome at the centre (that maximises the daylight and emits light at night) and multiple wings elevating the roof profile. The form is akin to a bird set to take off with its wing raised high while the rear side (airside) design is inspired from a spaceship. Looking at such structures one wants to thank technology for the advancement it has got in today’s designs. Giving it full credit Architect Shah avers that being an important tool for all advancement and innovations, with adequate know-how and proper understanding oflatest technology, the variety of usages can be adopted to achieve the best of results in terms of properutilization of materials.\nThe aesthetics of the interiors have been intelligently dealt with. Circular stainless steel columns in the volumetric arrival and departure lounges have props in the upper end that serve as architectural and structural elements of expression. Care has been taken to combine services with the aesthetic elements of the building. For example, these columns serve in integrating the vertical AHU system. Indoor landscape courtyards and water bodies provide relief while the strategic planning of mounds and contours camouflage the ongoing traffic movement.\nWith building services aptly planned in the underground trenches, the building has been made ‘Green’ by incorporating elements of energy conservation, waste water and resource management. Dwelling further on green aspects, Architect Shah adds, “Materials of the building envelope, heat loads, indoor air quality, air conditioning equipment, insulation materials, its wrappings and duct leakage rates are all in conformity with the recommendations of ASHRAE / IES STANDARD 90.1/IECC to minimize the energy demand of the building. All joints in the building, door and window frames, which are potential source of air leakage, have been sealed and the systems have been aimed f\n- Chennai’s Second International Airport (chennaifocus.wordpress.com)\n- Modernized Domestic Airport to Open for Public on April 14 2012 (chennaifocus.wordpress.com)']	['<urn:uuid:93662120-5b1c-4317-812d-9d7b726b6750>', '<urn:uuid:9bde939f-6cf8-453e-8c7e-fc4d7d099550>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-01T23:21:14.341336	15	51	3964
