1	origins kwara state public library	The Kwara State Public Library was established after the creation of Kwara State in 1967, following the decentralization of the Northern regional library in Kaduna. It initially began operations in an area court building with inherited materials from the defunct northern region and a 300-pound budget for additional books. The library commenced public services on April 1st, 1968, but faced accommodation challenges for two decades. A purposefully-built library was finally commissioned on November 21st, 1990, by military president Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida. After falling into disrepair, it was renovated and recommissioned on July 1st, 2006.	"['Date of this Version\nLibrary Philosophy and Practice 2012\nThere are many kind of libraries for different purpose. Unlike the other types of libraries that are meant for specific group of users, public libraries are not restricted to any group of users. They are more or less a universal library; as some perceive them as the ""poor people\'s university""; expected to serve all kinds of people including young children, the physically challenged and those who, for one reason or the other, are incapacitated, such as the hospital patients and the prisoners. Public libraries serve the general needs of cities, towns, villages and some larger areas and are saddled with the responsibilities of serving the entire group of users of a community where they are located, regardless of age, sex, religion, complexion and profession.\nWhen the librarian accepts holdings into his repository, it implies taking the responsibility for their custody. All this may be jeopardized, if the library is damaged or lost as a result of a disaster. Viewed from the point of view of the library, a disaster can be anything or event which directly or indirectly affects the normal administration of the library i. e. the disruption of services to readers on either a short-time or a long-time basis. This is different from the normal nature of events that are termed or described as disasters. Natural events like earthquakes, flood, and volcanic eruption are termed disaster because of the effects they have on human beings as well as their normal way of occurrence. Also, man-made events like fire, acts of war and terrorism, structural (building) deficiencies and chemical spills are termed disaster; because of their effects on materials and properties of the library. However, criminal acts, like book theft and mutilation are also termed as physical disasters.\nIt can be argued that the classification of disasters into natural and man-made has very little importance for the identification of what actually is a disaster. Thus, an event becomes a disaster, only when man and the environment he has created or lived in, are affected; whereby the environment can be a nation, community, business organization, office, museum, or library. The moment these settings are disturbed and normal services are disrupted, the situation can be termed as a disaster. Hence, a disaster as an unexpected consequences to the holdings or materials in the custody of the librarians stressing that it can be a small-scale incident or a full-blown emergency; even though in both cases, the event or situation requires prompt action to limit damages.\nAlegbeleye (1993) defined disaster as an event that ""results in the sudden removal of records and documents from accessibility and use""; stating further that the disaster can be regarded as an occurrence that temporarily or permanently render information contained in document inaccessible. A disaster can be seen as an overwhelming ecological disruption occurring on scale sufficient to require outside assistance. Indeed, disasters are exceptional events which suddenly kill or injure large number of people and damage properties. Looking at disaster in a generic information management context, it can be viewed as any incident which threatens human safety; and/or damages or threatens to damage a library\'s buildings collection (or items therein), equipment and system.\nThere are varied causes and for that matter classification of disaster. Alegbeleye (1993) agreed that the simplest and most common are the grouping into natural and man-made categories. They stated further that natural disasters are happenings, over which man has very little or no control and are generally initiated by such events as floods, earthquakes, storms, cyclones and hurricanes; among others. Man- induced disasters include war-time destruction, bombings, rioting, malicious vandalism, arson, negligence, power surges and failures. Irrespective of sources of disasters, the destruction and devastation they cause or threaten to cause to library resources and the provision of library services remain a critical factor in the management of libraries.\nAlegbeleye (1993) also mentioned two commonly recurring causes of library disasters to include floods and fires. Anderson and McIntyre (1985) however added vandalism, theft, earthquake, insect infection and the effect of light and temperature to the list of causes of disasters in libraries. Ngulube (2005) noted that although humankind tend to associate the term \'disaster\' with devastating floods, hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, risks and hazards to documentary materials, which include insects and rodents, mould and humidity, tornadoes, forest fire, volcanic eruption etc. can occur anytime without notice.\nMeanwhile, a disaster plan, according to Lyall (1993), is a document which describes the procedures devised to prevent and prepare for disasters, and those proposed to respond to and recover from disasters when they occur. The responsibility for performing these tasks is allocated to various staff members who comprise \'the disaster team\'. The plan should be comprehensive enough to consist several independent yet interrelated smaller plans, recognizing that every disaster has three phases; before, during and after. A number of plans is required to cope with each of the phases namely: \'before phase\', should encompass two types of plan viz: preventive and preparedness; implying everyday routine operations. Whereas preventive plans recommend actions to prevent most disasters; such as the repair of leaking roofs, the improvement of maintenance and the upgrading of security, preparedness plans aimed at ensuring that identified disasters can be managed recommending actions such as the identification of important items in the collection, the purchase of plastic sheeting, the provision of freezing facilities and the training of staff to enable them to respond to different disasters. The \'during phase\' requires a response to the disaster; the effectiveness of which is hinged on the thoroughness of the preparedness plan. The \'after phase\' is where the recovery plans are implemented; though not in details; given the unique nature of every disaster.\nIn each of the preventive, preparedness, response and recovery plans, priority attention should be given to possible areas to be affected by the disaster. These areas are:\n- personnel including staff, users and visitors\n- collections and records including all categories of archival records, serials, monographs, manuscripts, maps, sound recordings, computer discs, optical and video discs, pictorial materials, and their related catalogues.\n- It is also important to consider the protection of the institution\'s vital records. These are usually considered to be those records without which the institution could not operate. All legal documents, essential files and financial records are included in this category\n- building and equipment including equipment, vehicles, air conditioning plant, plumbing, electrical services and computers (Lyall, 1993).\nThe desired that the plan be prepared by a team and not an individual is due to the fact that such a plan must naturally apply to the building and all its contents, including people, collections, records and equipment. Thus, preparing the plan involves five main steps viz:\n- conducting a risk analysis\n- identification of existing preventive and preparedness procedures\n- making recommendations to implement additional preventive and preparedness procedures\n- allocating responsibilities\n- devising procedures to respond to and recover from disasters (Lyall, 1993).\nOn their part, Newey, Lepschi & Croft (2008) identified the objectives of the disaster plan as including to:\n- minimise damage to the collections;\n- recover and repair any damaged collection materials; and\n- return the library and archival services to normal.\nThese objectives are facilitated by the plan through provision of a framework and guidelines for the following:\n- rapid and effective response to an emergency;\n- good communication;\n- ensuring staff are well trained;\n- ensuring appropriate equipment and materials are available; and\n- enabling assistance from outside organisations. Historical Background of Kwara State Public Library, Ilorin\nAfter the creation of Kwara State along with others in 1967, the need for a public library service in it became pressing. The Northern regional library, Kaduna was decentralized for the new States to establish their own. The area court building was chosen as a suitable place that could accommodate the new library, before it moved to its location in October 1967. Apart from the inherited library materials from the defunct northern region, a total sum of 300 pounds was released to the Interim Administrative Council to purchase more books for the library. On 1st April 1968, the Kwara State Library commenced services to the public after which it was realized that the borrowed building was quite unsuitable due to its closeness to the central market. The problem of accommodation persisted for two decades during which the library moved from one building to the other. The lack of a befitting infrastructure was a setback to the library and frantic efforts were made by many to secure a suitable and permanent building for the library. In November 1987, the then military Governor, Lt. Col. Ahmed Abdullahi laid the foundation of a purposefully-built library where it presently occupies. The completed building was commissioned by the then military president, Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida on 21st November 1990. Between 1990 and 2001, the teeming reading population in the State made use of the library. Within a decade and half, the building got dilapidated, its stock became out-dated and irrelevant to the information needs of users. On assumption of duty as Governor, Dr. Bukola Saraki visited the dilapidated library and promised it a face-lift. Renovation started on 23rd November, 2005. The transformed library building was commissioned and put back to use 1st July 2006 (Kwara State Library Handbook, 2006). Like other libraries, it comprises the Administrative, Technical Services and Reader Services, Acquisitions, Cataloguing/Classification, Circulation, Reference, Automation, Children and Serials divisions as well as an Internet café. Electronic resources are available through dedicated websites for the library while it uses ALICE for windows for its automation and an electronic device system for the security of its collection. The library was established primarily to serve as local center of information that will make all kinds of knowledge and information readily available to its numerous users irrespective of their age, sex, race, religion, nationality, language or social status. However, there is no total claim to it that the library has fulfilled these service provision obligations to its numerous patrons.']"	['<urn:uuid:435806ec-bd89-47fe-acaf-9326861433e4>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-01T23:33:07.948974	5	94	1670
2	brown headed cowbird breeding survival threats	Brown-headed Cowbirds have remarkable breeding and survival strategies. Females lay up to 36 eggs per season in other birds' nests, with each female potentially mating with multiple males. They've developed aggressive tactics like the 'cowbird mafia' behavior where females destroy nests that reject their eggs. Despite being parasitic, cowbirds have thrived with an estimated 56 million individuals across the Western Hemisphere. However, they face general wildlife threats including habitat loss, climate change, and accidental deaths from collisions with buildings and vehicles.	"['THE ""BLACK VAGABOND""\nCome April each year, we\'re always delighted as the first spring migrants begin appearing at Hilton Pond Center. Blue-gray Gnatcatchers, Eastern Phoebes, Indigo Buntings, and Ruby-throated Hummingbirds are among our earliest arrivals, and there\'s always a big spike in the number of Chipping Sparrows visiting our feeders--although we haven\'t determined if these little rusty-caps migrate in or are local residents with sudden yearning for white millet. Another species that seems to crave millet is one whose presence we welcome because of its fine plumage but would rather not have around due to its lifestyle. We speak here of a ""Black Vagabond""--the Brown-headed Cowbird--a social parasite whose proclivity for depositing eggs in other birds\' nests can have significant impact on songbird populations.\nAll text & photos © Hilton Pond Center\nBrown-headed Cowbirds (male, above) have been seen around Hilton Pond in all months of the year, but never predictably nor in large numbers. During cold weather they tend to congregate with other blackbirds, so it\'s not unusual a few times each winter to have a flock of a thousand Common Grackles, Rusty Blackbirds, and cowbirds descend on the property to plow through dead leaves in search of seeds and invertebrates. Usually, about 95% are grackles and sometimes a few European Starlings are in the mix. When spring approaches, these foraging flocks disintegrate as former participants start hanging with their own kind. Most of the blackbirds eventually pair off, but Brown-headed Cowbirds have a different social system--one in which both sexes are promiscuous. In fact, we\'ve found one of the best ways to catch male cowbirds is to use live females as bait. Many times a female in one of our ground traps have attracted the attention of a half-dozen or so males who got snared themselves when they tried to get at a potential mate.\nIt may be that a female cowbird (above) HAS TO have more than one male, for in a given breeding season she lays an egg a day for perhaps 10-12 days, takes a few days off and lays a dozen more, and then recycles once again before finishing with a total of up to three dozen eggs. This fecundity is much greater than typical passerines and is a significant accomplishment for a bird that doesn\'t even build a nest. It seems the female Brown-headed Cowbird is quite adept at watching another bird construct a nest into which she places her own cowbird egg before moving on to lay her next day\'s egg in some OTHER victim\'s nest. Indeed, the cowbird\'s scientific name alludes to this failure to establish its own nest as a home base and to its appearance; the generic name Molothrus means ""vagabond,"" while the species epithet ater is Latin for ""black,"" referring to body plumage of the male.)\nAlthough some birds remove cowbird eggs from their nests, many such as vireos and warblers simply incubate the cowbird egg with their own. The cowbird egg develops--often getting a head start by hatching a day ahead of its nestmates--and the cowbird chick quickly becomes the dominant bird in the brood. Since surrogate parents feed the aggressive cowbird first, it grows more rapidly and achieves maximum size--perhaps two or three times that of its foster mother and father. If you\'re a diminutive warbler, it may take all your energy to raise this giant, gluttonous interloper--especially since a cowbird fledgling (left) will continue to beg for food and might prevent foster parents from having a second brood. This scenario has caused birds such as the once-common Yellow Warbler to undergo significant population reductions--so much so that some songbird species have vanished from parts of their original range.\nBirdwatchers and environmentalists sometimes debate whether Brown-headed Cowbirds are ""native"" to the Carolinas, or whether human activity has drawn them in from elsewhere. We frequently refer to them as ""buffalo birds"" to emphasize they likely originated in the Great Plains, where they followed American Bison from place to place, eating insects stirred up by grazing herds. (As a reflection of this, Lewis and Clark referred to cowbirds as ""buffalo-peckers."") However, there WERE expanses of prairie in the Carolina Piedmont--especially in the vicinity of the modern-day counties of York (SC) and Mecklenburg (NC); there also were a good many bison in the Carolinas prior to the arrival of European settlers. It\'s quite interesting that when the Brown-headed Cowbird was first described by science, the description was based on a specimen collected in South Carolina by early French explorers and written up by naturalist Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton (1716-1800). He called the cowbird Troupiale, de la Caroline--the Carolina Oriole--an appropriate name because brightly colored orioles, like cowbirds, are in the Blackbird Family.\nEven before Daubenton, Mark Catesby in his 1731 edition of Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahama Islands rendered a female ""Cowpen Bird""--shown above right with a male ""Towhe-bird."" Catesby wrote:\nNOTE: We wonder if Catesby depicted together the Eastern Towhee (which he called Passer Niger, Oculis Rubris or ""black bird with red eye"") and the Brown-headed Cowbird (Passer Fusca or ""dusky bird"") because he thought they were somehow related. In reality, towhees are sparrows (Emberizidae) and cowbirds are blackbirds (Icteridae), but because both have black bills that are more or less conical, these two ground-feeding birds might look superficially similar.\nObviously, based just on the work of Catesby and Daubenton, there were at least small populations of cowbirds present in Colonial America, but we suspect across the eastern U.S. they are much more common today than 275 years ago. Humans have altered the landscape significantly, cutting down dense forest and replacing it with farmland and grazeland more suitable to cowbirds. Most important, habitat fragmentation has enabled cowbirds to enter areas where they did not occur historically; not only is there more space but now they can parasitize nests of new species they never encountered on the Great Plains or Piedmont Prairies. Unlike prairie nesters, these new victims--especially woodland breeders--did not evolve with cowbirds as social parasites, so they likely have no natural defenses against such parasitization.\nAlthough some birders have knee-jerk reactions against the cowbird\'s parasitic behavior, having the bird in the hand gives a different perspective. The seemingly black dorsal plumage of the male Brown-headed Cowbird becomes a metallic abstraction (above), with shades of cobalt blue and green glinting like gun steel. The female\'s back feathers (below)--more loosely structured--are drab by comparison, but even they have hints of greenish iridescence. Nonetheless, the overall mousey gray-brown color of the female cowbird undoubtedly makes her less noticeable as she spies on potential nests in which to place her eggs.\nSo how did Brown-headed Cowbirds become social parasites in the first place? One hypothesis is that following buffalo herds made cowbirds true wanderers; such a lifestyle interfered with nest-building and made it advantageous to be able to lay eggs that other species would end up tending. However, other kinds of birds also have been known to lay an egg in the nest of foster parents, and none of them follow grazing animal herds. It seems more likely social parasitism arose because gravid female birds have to put the egg somewhere; if a female is far from her own nest when her egg is ready--or if her nest was destroyed by a predator or weather--the female might seek out another\'s nest for the deposit. If her chick then survives under care of foster parents, over time such serendipitous egg-laying might become the norm and, eventually, a necessity. Any bird that lays an ""extra"" egg in the nest of another pair is technically a social parasite; cowbirds merely take the behavior to the extreme, including not ever building a nest of their own.\nThere\'s no question their non-nest-building lifestyle has enabled Brown-headed Cowbirds to do pretty well in a changing environment. Experts with Partners In Flight estimate there are 56 million cowbirds in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and parts of the Caribbean, placing them in the category of ""Least Concern"" with regard to survivability. And many cowbird individuals are assertive--witness our need to wear a leather glove to photograph one especially aggressive male (below left)--which means they get at least their share of food when they flock together with other blackbirds and starlings. Females are careful observers of other species when they need nests in which to lay their eggs, but cowbirds are even more resourceful than one might think--as discovered recently by Jeffrey Hoover and Scott Robinson. The two ornithologists described a ""cowbird mafia,"" i.e., female cowbirds that ""trash"" nests from which the host bird has removed a cowbird egg. Such behavior ""encourages"" protective host birds not to mess with a cowbird egg lest their own future progeny get roughed up. Furthermore, some female cowbirds destroy a nest and steal the host\'s eggs BEFORE laying their cowbird eggs, thereby forcing the host to build a new nest. Since second clutches are typically smaller, this may mean fewer host bird nestlings are present to compete when the cowbird finally lays her own egg in the newly constructed nest.\nLove \'em for the color and unusual gurgling song, or hate \'em because they lay eggs in the nests of other birds, one has to admire Brown-headed Cowbirds for their resourcefulness and survival skills. With 56 million of them scattered around the Western Hemisphere, we suspect they are here to stay, so we might as well study them a little more closely to see what other secrets they might reveal. To that end we\'ve banded 361 cowbirds at Hilton Pond Center since 1982, with 90 of those captured between January and June 1988; none ever returned in a later year or showed up elsewhere.\nOne thing we wonder is whether--with all those male cowbirds trying to breed promiscuously with all those females--who actually gets to mate? Can younger, second-year males--identifiable in-hand by the pale and sometimes ragged condition of their underwing coverts (above)--still impress a female when they spread their wings in courtship display, or do only older males have the right moves to win over a female long enough to copulate? To us these are interesting questions whose answers might be easier to acquire at Hilton Pond if our Brown-headed Blackbirds weren\'t such vagabonds with no place they call home.\nAll text & photos © Hilton Pond Center\nComments or questions about this week\'s installment?\nBe sure to scroll down for an account of all\nThanks to the following fine folks for recent gifts in support of Hilton Pond Center for Piedmont Natural History and/or Operation RubyThroat: The Hummingbird Project.

Wildlife are forced to either adapt to life with humans or face extinction.\nWhen we expand our territories, we invade wildlife’s territories. When forests are cleared and fields subdivided, wildlife is affected. Some species that can not evade bulldozers, like salamanders and turtles, may die outright. Others, like birds and some mammals, are forced into adjacent patches of habitat. That habitat may not be suitable for them to survive. Then we force our wildlife to navigate onto roads, across power lines, and around wind turbines.\n- Habitat Loss\n- Climate Change\n- Invasive and Exotic Species\n- Illegal Trapping and Poaching\n- Accidental Deaths\nThe survival of every species of wildlife is critical to preserving our state’s rich biodiversity and unique natural history. Over time, we have altered our landscape to mostly benefit people and our civilization. We cut down forests for agriculture and housing developments, we introduce exotic species, and we change natural processes by releasing pollutants and greenhouse gases. The major threat to wildlife in New Jersey is habitat loss. However, wildlife face a variety of threats that include climate change, invasive/exotic species, pollution, illegal trapping, and accidental deaths.\nHabitat loss is the destruction of habitat. Habitat fragmentation is the degradation, destruction, or alteration of once continuous habitat when we alter and “chop up” the environment. Humans are the main cause for the loss of habitat. Wildlife that used to live there are usually displaced or killed. It is the leading cause for the loss of species from extinction.\nThe effects can be devastating. Gaps and breaks in large patches of habitat create suitable habitat for less desirable species and unsuitable habitat for native species. For example, in North America before European settlement the Brown-headed cowbird only occupied the Great Plains region. Today, its range has dramatically increased. Over time land use-land change practices fragmented forested habitat and created optimal cowbird habitat. Habitat fragmentation has allowed the cowbirds to expand their range to most of the continent south of the Arctic.\nHabitat loss is the leading cause for the loss of species from extinction.\nMany migratory songbird populations have declined because they are very susceptible to cowbird parasitism. Songbirds that nest in forested areas near cowbird habitat (open areas) are the most vulnerable. The cowbird is a generalist parasite (the female relies on other birds to raise its young). It lays its eggs in other smaller bird’s nests. Most birds can spot the different egg, but most do not notice and keep incubating. Generally, the cowbird’s egg hatches first (warblers’ eggs hatch in 12-14 days; cowbirds’ eggs usually hatch in 10-13). This slight advantage gives the cowbird nestling a head start. The cowbird nestling almost always outcompetes the other nestlings for food.\nClimate Change or global warming is the overall increase in average temperatures on Earth. The rate of warming has increased dramatically due to the increased outputs of greenhouse gases (particularly carbon dioxide) since the industrial revolution. Its effects on wildlife are dramatic. Entire populations will be effected. Many species are already in jeopardy of becoming extinct, like the Polar bear. Other species will have to adapt to a warmer planet. It is believed that many ecosystems will shift north. Our climate in New Jersey will be like the climate in South Carolina if nothing is done to reduce our impact on our planet. Climate change may also significantly alter the chemical balance of the seas, off-shore currents, and plankton distribution and abundance, thereby affecting migration routes of marine species and impacting the entire food web.\nInvasive and exotic species are species that were introduced to North America that reduce biodiversity of native species. Many exotics were accidentally introduced during the colonial times when many plants (from other continents) were used as packing materials on ships. Animals from other continents may have also hitched a ride in those same ships or they were intentionally brought to North America. Invasive plants choke out natives and do not provide the same functions in the ecosystem. Exotic species can wreak havoc on native populations of wildlife by displacing them or altering their habitat.\nMost exotics are able to quickly adapt to our environment. For example, house cats are not native and can have devastating effects on bird populations. Surveys have shown that only 35% of the known 77 million pet cats are kept indoors (American Bird Conservancy). Feral cats compete with native predators, reproduce quickly, and transmit disease. It is estimated that hundreds of millions of birds and billions of small mammals are killed by feral cats each year (American Bird Conservancy). Cats are opportunistic and kill a variety of birds. Common birds like Cardinals and endangered birds like the Piping plover all can fall prey to feral cats.\nPollution is man-made waste or by-products that are released into the environment. Pollutants can change ecosystems and can have severe effects on people, wildlife and the natural environment. Many organisms ingest or absorb harmful toxins that ultimately get passed along through the food chain. Persistent pollutants, like DDT, PCBs, and heavy metals bio-accumulate (are stored in fat) in predators. All of the effects, especially over the long-term, are unknown. In many species bio-accumulation can be associated with reduced reproduction or death.\nFor example, the widespread and heavy use of persistent pesticides (DDT and DDE) in the 1950’s caused severe declines in many species of raptors. At the time, the effects of DDT on wildlife and the environment were unknown. It was quickly absorbed into soils and the environment and it was found to persist for a very long time. It caused egg shells to thin by inhibiting the production of calcium, which reduced their rate of reproduction. DDT is highly toxic to fish. It accumulates and gets concentrated through the food chain. When they were consumed by fish-eating raptors the DDT contributed to their decline. Since then, many pollutants have been banned in the U.S.; however, trace amounts are still found in many raptors and large fish.\nNon-point source pollution can also have major impacts, but it is hard to measure because it comes from all across our landscape. When the rain falls and washes our roads clean, for example, the runoff carries car oil, metals, sediment, trace toxins, and litter (and even heat) down the storm drains and into nearby streams and rivers. It washes fertilizers, pesticides, pet waste and grass clippings from our lawns; farm fields give up soil, nutrients, and chemicals too. Fish spawning habitat may become smothered with silt. The extra nutrients and higher temperatures can cause oxygen-stealing blooms of algae and eutrophication in water bodies. Even the road salt that helps keep us safe in winter will accumulate in wetlands, causing problems for amphibians, aquatic animals, and plants. On the plus side, non-point source pollution is one threat we can all do something about, with a little care and education.\nPersistent marine debris, such as plastic bags and bottle caps, balloons, discarded fishing line, and medical waste threatens many forms of marine life. Such items may entangle and suffocate, drown, or otherwise restrict the movement of marine life or may be ingested and ultimately lead to the death of that animal. Such debris may take several hundred years to break down, thereby threatening wildlife for many years.\nAnother form of pollution is noise pollution. Whales’ primary means of communication, navigation, locating food, locating mates, and avoiding predators and other threats is through their sense of hearing, which is much more highly developed than that of humans. Noise pollution created by ship traffic or offshore construction may negatively impact whales by disrupting their normal behavior. Active sonar, such as that used by the Navy, also threatens marine mammals by disrupting navigation, foraging and communication abilities. There have been instances of whale stranding and death caused by acoustic trauma. This may be due to a fatal injury within the structure of the ear, or may result from the distressed animal surfacing too rapidly and developing nitrogen bubbles within their blood (decompression sickness).\nWildlife trafficking is thought to be one of the most profitable illegal trades in the world.\nIllegal trapping, poaching, and other demands for wildlife are a huge problem throughout the world. Many species are sought for their use as valuable products. Snakes are sought for their skins, elephants for their ivory tusks, and birds for their feathers. Wildlife are also trapped or taken from wild populations to be sold or bred in the pet trade. The worldwide demand for pets and medicinal products drives the illegal trade of wildlife, especially rare species. Sadly enough, wildlife trafficking is thought to be one of the most profitable illegal trades in the world.\nIn many parts of the world, people kill wildlife for food or to protect their food source. Northern South America is where Ospreys winter. They catch and eat fish, sometimes from fish farms. People will shoot ospreys to protect fish farming operations in these areas where they are not protected. You can help protect Ospreys by not supporting fish that are farmed in these regions.\nAccidental deaths and collisions pose considerable threats to vulnerable species. An unknown number of deaths are caused by this worldwide. Accidental entanglement in fishing nets and collisions with ships pose major threats to marine mammals, especially whales. Vehicles strike birds and other wildlife when driving along roads. Large buildings, towers, and wind turbines also injure or kill many different species of wildlife.\nWildlife Viewing Map\nLearn the best sites to view wildlife in New Jersey.
