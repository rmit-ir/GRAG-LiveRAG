1	what defines behavioral asset pricing model difference from traditional model reading economics paper	The basic difference between behavioral and traditional asset-pricing models lies in their assumptions about agents' preferences, particularly those of a hypothetical representative agent. Behavioral models depart from the assumption of time-stationary expected utility (Savage rationality) and may incorporate concepts like loss aversion, hyperbolic discounting, or state-dependent utility functions.	"[""آیا مدل های رفتاری قیمت گذاری دارایی، ساختاری است؟\n|کد مقاله||سال انتشار||مقاله انگلیسی||ترجمه فارسی||تعداد کلمات|\n|10775||2002||14 صفحه PDF||سفارش دهید||5988 کلمه|\nPublisher : Elsevier - Science Direct (الزویر - ساینس دایرکت)\nJournal : Journal of Monetary Economics, Volume 49, Issue 1, January 2002, Pages 215–228\nThe recent increase in interest in so-called behavioral models of asset-pricing is motivated partly by the desire to have models that appear realistic in light of experimental evidence, and partly by their success in moment-matching exercises. This paper argues that the attention given to these two criteria misses perhaps the most important aspect of the modeling exercises. That is, the search for parameters that are invariant to changes in the economic environment. It is precisely this invariance that motivates the use of a tightly parameterized general equilibrium model. Assessing a model on this dimension is difficult and, as the paper argues through the use of suggestive examples, will undoubtedly require strong subjective judgments about the reasonableness of preference assumptions. Such judgments are routinely made about the reasonableness of assumptions about stochastic endowments. The paper suggests that more effort be applied to understanding aggregation in these models and to the exploration of behavioral assumptions in a less flexible but less corruptible time-stationary recursive class of preferences.\nThe recent successes of behavioral asset-pricing models provide new hope for the quantitative research program started by Mehra and Prescott (1985) following the theoretical work of Lucas (1978). That is, there is a renewed interest in the ability of a tightly parameterized, representative-agent, general-equilibrium model to explain the salient features of historical asset-market data (e.g., large equity premium, excess volatility, etc.). What makes an asset-pricing model “behavioral” can itself be the subject of debate. For the purposes of this paper, I will lump all asset-pricing models that endow agents with preferences that do not adhere to the assumption of time-stationary expected utility (i.e., “Savage rationality”), into the category of “behavioral”. Many of these preference assumptions are directly motivated by evidence from experimental psychology and behavioral decision theory, e.g., loss aversion (Epstein and Zin, 1990; Benartzi and Thaler, 1995; Barberis et al., 1999), or hyperbolic discounting (Luttmer and Mariotti, 2000; Krusell and Smith, 2000). Also falling within this broad definition, however, are models that may depart from classical assumption by allowing for state-dependent utility functions, but that are less formally motivated by behavioral evidence, e.g., habit formation (Abel, 1990; Constantinides, 1990; Campbell and Cochrane, 1995; Wachter, 2001). These examples are suggestive and are in no way an exhaustive list of behavioral asset-pricing models. Indeed as more experimental evidence filters into economics from various fields of psychology, this list continues to grow at a rapid rate. This paper takes a sympathetic view of these recent behavioral approaches and tries to identify what these models have yet to accomplish before they can claim success and presumably supplant more traditional approaches. Particular attention is paid to the need for structural models, and whether behavioral models are more or less likely to achieve the sort of “deep structural excavation” called for by the rational expectations revolution in dynamic macroeconomics. The methodological guidelines laid out by Friedman and Lucas in the two quotes above, cast a very different light on the current debate about the usefulness of behavioral versus more traditional models of asset markets, than what one might hear in academic circles and even in the popular press. From this perspective, traditional models cannot be viewed as inherently better because of their reliance on well-understood Savage rationality. Likewise, behavioral models cannot claim superiority simply based on experimental evidence of individual departures from this definition of rationality, and the sense of modeling realism that this evidence invokes. If this debate can be settled, then following Lucas’ advice, it can only be settled by determining which approach to building a mechanical, imitation economy provides “better imitations” of real asset markets. It is now common for behavioral models to adopt the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium approach of Lucas (1978) and Mehra and Prescott (1985) as a framework for understanding the consequences of alternative behavioral assumptions on observables in asset markets. In other words, the basic difference between the two approaches can be thought of as differences in assumptions about agents’ preferences — most often a hypothetical representative agent. Therefore, the common use of dynamic general equilibrium endowment economies by both approaches provides a common framework for comparison. The use of these general equilibrium models highlights an implicit desire to obtain structural models. In this case, “structural” is used to differentiate between purely statistical descriptions of empirical evidence (which may or may not use economic theory to suggest functional forms and factors), from models that derive their empirical predictions directly from the structure of a parametric version of an economic theory. The obvious implication being that like more traditional models, behavioral models can potentially provide useful guidance for understanding the likely consequences of changes in the economic environment. That is, they can be used to make forecasts about situations in which we have no (or at least very little) historical evidence. If that was not the desire of behavioralists in finance, then behavioral arguments could be safely relegated to a relatively minor role in the design and interpretation of reduced-form econometric models. Predicting responses to changes in the economic environment, e.g., changes in government policy, therefore, are precisely the “particular questions” for which we seek “better imitations”, using Lucas’ words, or the “sufficiently accurate predictions”, using Friedman's words. The primary reason for using tightly parameterized general equilibrium models to characterize asset-market outcomes is precisely the need for identifying policy-invariant structural parameters. Behavioral models have an obvious and important advantage over traditional models: their parameters can be calibrated so that various moments of particular interest of the distribution of asset prices generated by these models, will closely match their sample counterparts in historical data. That is, they do a better job imitating the large equity premiums, volatility, and persistent dynamics that are so puzzling from the perspective of traditional models. Clearly, this data-fitting exercise seems like a necessary condition for evaluating the usefulness of any equilibrium model. We would have little confidence in any model's ability to forecast outcomes in new environments when it is incapable of forecasting in the current environment. These conclusions, however, require a fair bit of judgment on the part of the modeler. Section 2 outlines judgments that modeler's working in this area typically make about the reasonableness of assumptions about the stochastic properties of exogenous variables. A simple example demonstrates that poorly fitting Savage-rational models can be made to fit empirical evidence by making assumptions about higher-order moments of the distribution of endowments. Most people would object to this strategy, however, since these assumptions might not seem reasonable given their prior beliefs. Where these beliefs come from is unspecified. They may derive from beliefs about the deeper micro-foundations of production, or they may derive from personal experience, or they may be purely whimsical. Direct statistical evidence about these higher-order-moment assumptions is likely to be misleading, or at best inconclusive, so we are left with non-sample-based judgments about the reasonableness of these assumptions. Section 3 of the paper looks at a similar sort of reasonableness criterion for preference assumptions. Unfortunately, unlike the case of assumptions about endowments, we are not yet at the stage where there is a consensus about what types of preference assumptions are unreasonable. The examples in Section 3 demonstrate that virtually any well-fitting, reduced-form empirical model of asset pricing can be incorporated into the representative agent's preferences so that a purely statistical model could be viewed as the outcome of what one could claim to be a structural general equilibrium model. Naturally, there is no guarantee that a model constructed in this way will have parameters that are invariant to the types of structural change for which these models must provide guidance. Analogous to the case for reasonableness of endowments, the modeler is forced to make judgments about the reasonableness of the preference assumptions. It is clear that fitting historical data is not a sufficient criterion for determining the usefulness of particular preference assumptions for delivering a structurally stable model. Likewise, without some explicit aggregation results, individual-level experimental evidence will also be insufficient. The main conclusion of this paper is straightforward: the parameters of asset-pricing models including behavioral models must be invariant to changes in the economic environment. This is not a very original conclusion and it is not likely to be very controversial. What is controversial and quite difficult, is assessing whether this goal has been met. Econometric testing for structural stability is notoriously problematic, especially in small samples. Moreover if the type of structural change under investigation has no historical counterpart, then purely statistical testing will be uninformative. The examples in 2 and 3 of the paper suggest that any assessment of the structural stability of a model will require the use of both non-sample information and the researcher's judgment. Accounting for historical evidence is not enough. The researcher is forced to evaluate the reasonableness of the assumptions on preferences and technologies under which the asset-pricing model can both account for historical evidence and maintain its basic structure in the face of significant changes in the economic environment. If aggregation results are available, then preferences of the representative agent that appear unreasonable given individual-level evidence would certainly be a cause for concern. These results also suggest that maintaining time-consistency as a basic axiom for preferences, and avoiding the introduction of arbitrary state variables in the utility function, will help eliminate much of the scope for well-fitting but non-structural empirical asset-pricing models to pass as deeper structural models.\nنتیجه گیری انگلیسی\nThe purpose of trying to characterize asset-market data using a tightly parameterized, representative-agent, general-equilibrium model is to try to uncover deep structural parameters. This is equally true of behavioral models as it is of more traditionally expected utility models. This is not a simple task and, as the examples in this paper suggest, fitting historical data is not sufficient to insure structural stability. Evaluating a model in this dimension will always require an element of subjective judgment of the reasonableness of the assumptions of the model. This is perhaps even more true of behavioral asset-pricing models than more traditionally expected utility models. The reason is that behavioral evidence may suggest the inclusion of state variables in the utility function and the relaxation of the stationarity assumption of intertemporal preferences. This exposes these models to the risk of being reverse engineered to fit the data, without serious consideration of whether the parameters of the model can be deemed structural. Econometric testing for structural stability is likely to be problematic, especially in small samples. In addition, statistical test will be uninformative if the types of change to the economic environment being contemplated has no natural analog in historical experience. A better understanding of how behavioral models aggregate provides some hope for reaching a consensus about reasonableness, since this will allow inference about the representative agent's preferences based on individual-level experimental evidence. Finally, since the use of behavioral models often opens the door for claims of reverse engineering, it seems prudent to work harder to avoid these criticisms. Maintaining assumptions on recursivity and time-stationarity of intertemporal preferences, while incorporating behavioral concepts is both feasible, as shown in Epstein and Zin (1990), and desirable given the discipline that this will naturally enforce on the modeling exercise.""]"	['<urn:uuid:417fbc69-80f9-4b53-8b5c-1c9cdd2bb0e9>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	novice	2025-04-22T14:43:01.810270	13	48	1901
2	As an architectural photographer, I notice my building shots often have exposure issues with bright skies. What's the best way to handle this common problem with auto settings?	When the camera automatically exposes for the sky, it can leave the building too dark. To solve this, you have two options: if your camera has exposure adjustment, try increasing the exposure by about one stop and take another shot. If that doesn't resolve the issue, try taking the picture from a different angle while minimizing the amount of sky in the frame.	"['Learning patterns/Improving your building photography/ja\nWhat problem does this solve?\nYour photos of buildings don\'t seem to come out as well as you\'d hoped. Is it your camera? Is it the way you take the photos?\nWhat\'s the solution?\nHere\'s the good news: the quality of those photos can be greatly improved if you keep in mind a few simple tips. You don\'t need an expensive camera to take good shots – just a little knowledge and care when taking the image.\nよくある失敗 - カメラの構え方\nTake care to keep the camera straight. Spending ten seconds on composition (how the visual elements are arranged in the photo) and alignment can greatly improve your picture quality. And in spite of what you may see others doing, always hold your camera or your mobile phone in both hands when composing and taking the picture.\nCamera tilt is the single biggest problem with mobile phone uploads, and it\'s worth repeating: always hold your camera or your mobile phone in both hands when composing and taking the picture.\nWhile there are applications for later editing pictures by rotating them, it\'s much better to get it right in the first place.\nBuilding partly obscured\nTry to avoid objects that obstruct the view of your subject. Choose a different angle, or (if the obstruction – especially parked cars – might go away) come back later. If you absolutely can\'t avoid cars, for privacy reasons ensure that numberplates are not visible (the number plates had to be blurred out to display this image).\nIf your camera creates a timestamp watermark, please turn off that feature beforehand.\nDon\'t chop off the top of the building or, as some people like to say: ""make sure you get the cross on top of the steeple"". It can ruin a good picture if the viewer expects to see something that has been chopped off.\nThink about how far the edges of the building are from the frame. If the entire building won\'t fit in the frame, walk back if you can, or try a different angle. If there\'s nowhere from which you can take a good picture, concentrate on something else instead, such as some of the smaller architectural details.\nDon\'t chop off the bottom of the building unless it\'s unavoidable. It\'s easy to forget the bottom when you point your camera up to get the top of the building.\nIf the entire building won\'t fit in the frame, move back if you can, or try a different angle. If there\'s nowhere from which you can take a good picture, concentrate on something else instead such as some of the smaller architectural details.\nAvoid pointing the camera too close to the sun. The amount of flare in this photo makes the picture unusable, even though the sun itself is outside the frame.\nTo avoid camera movement, especially in dark church interiors, use the font or a pillar as a support. Blurred images such as this are of little use. Even outside, occasionally we\'re lucky enough to have something solid like a bench or fence conveniently located; if so, try resting your camera on it for greater stability, and see if the composition and alignment work from that angle.\nThis picture seems to have been taken one-handed; remember the rule about always holding your camera in two hands? Notice the annoying chopped-off candle holder on the left; again, think about each element in relation to the edges of your photo.\nCommon errors – auto settings\nThe camera has automatically exposed the sky correctly, but that leaves the building much too dark. If your camera has exposure adjustment, increase the exposure by about one stop and try again. If that doesn\'t solve the problem, take the picture from another angle and try to keep the amount of sky to a minimum.\nOverexposure like this is not very common on modern cameras. If you see it, check your camera settings: the ""exposure compensation"" may have been set incorrectly.\nCheck what your camera is focusing on\nHere, the camera autofocus has latched on to the lamp to the left, rather than the building.\nCommon errors – subjects\nPlease don\'t take photos of signs\nPlease don\'t upload photographs of posters, noticeboards, signs, modern murals, or anything else having text or two-dimensional images that might be copyright-protected. That applies even to text or images in a public place – even if everyone else is taking pictures of them. Ancient wall paintings in churches are fine: they have no copyright protection.\nHere, the copyright-protected text and images have been blurred out.

3	what methods does phoenix youth performing arts use respect hip hop authenticity	Rising Youth Theatre in Phoenix ensures hip-hop authenticity through several key methods: They partner with CYPHERS the Center for Urban Arts, which provides expertise in the five elements of hip-hop (B-boying, MC-ing, DJ-ing, Graffiti Art, and Knowledge). They involve the hip-hop community directly through story circles and require community approval of scripts. They perform in public spaces creating a 'Block Party' setting that pays homage to original hip-hop street battles from the 1970s Bronx. Their dramaturgy involves experts from multiple hip-hop disciplines and focuses on all elements of hip-hop culture rather than using it merely as a trendy addition.	['Respecting Hip Hop in Rising Youth Theatre’s production of antonia\na latina hip-hop Antigone\n“Rap is something you do, Hip-Hop is something you live.”—KRS-One\nThe mission of Rising Youth Theatre is to create youth driven theatre that is not only riveting and relevant, but also challenges audiences to hear new stories, start conversations, and participate in their communities. Heading into their fifth year anniversary, Co-Artistic Directors Xanthia Angel Walker and Sarah Sullivan have successfully promoted these ideals with a number of diverse communities throughout Phoenix, Arizona.\nRising Youth’s programming has touched on several important issues affecting today’s youth, such as high school dropout rates, juvenile incarceration, the foster care system, and immigration. For the first show of its 2015/2016 season, the organization reached out to the youth of the hip-hop community. With every show Rising Youth produces, the creative team engages with youth in the community through story circle interviews that focus on the community’s relationship to the issue being explored. From this interaction the playwright involved creates a play. For the first show of the season, the resulting project was an adaptation of a Sophocles’ play titled antonia: a latina hip-hop Antigone. Both the playwright and director felt that the themes in the play, such as power, fate vs. free will, rules vs. order, and feminism vs. gender, were relatable to hip-hop culture and the lives of the youth participating in the project.\nThe success of a TYA hip-hop performance is dependent on a communal form of dramaturgy that is similar to hip-hop’s cypher, or artistic gathering.\nIn the process of creating antonia, Rising Youth has made a conscious effort to respect hip-hop culture by avoiding the appropriation of hip-hop, which is present in numerous productions of theatre for young audience (TYA) across the United States. This cultural appropriation has manifested in hip-hop theatre, lending itself to bad and disingenuous theatrical experiences. The danger of unauthentic hip-hop theatre is that it is a false reflection of what hip-hop is and works towards keeping the culture marginalized. Expanding on this sentiment, Rising Youth’s goal with antonia is to create theatre that explores hip-hop and its origins. Director Xanthia Angel Walker states, “In the field of TYA, I have observed ‘hip-hop’ being inserted into plays as a trendy way of being ‘accessible’ to young people. There is little to no regard for the elements and principles of hip-hop that serve as a powerful community building tool and emancipatory force. This force is often disregarded and disrespected in ways that continually feed the dominant narrative of the Caucasian, middle class youth experience.”\nWith this production of antonia, Rising Youth decided to perform the piece in a public space, which promotes the idea of making theatre accessible to those who have little to no knowledge of theatre and/or hip-hop by creating a gathering space where audiences participate in a “Block Party” setting. As a result, Rising Youth breaks away from the traditional proscenium stage, while paying homage to the origins of hip-hop culture by mimicking the “battles” that occurred on the streets in the early 1970’s in The Boogie Down Bronx. Therefore, creating a community space where ritual becomes the driving force. The audience does not only watch a play, but also participates in an experience.\nI recommend that TYA theatres take note of Rising Youth’s process to mitigate the risks of creating unauthentic hip-hop theatre. I believe antonia models how to effectively and ethically create and produce hip-hop theatre. Three factors needed for producing hip-hop theatre are partnerships, dramaturgy, and community.\nFor antonia, Rising Youth is partnering with CYPHERS the Center for Urban Arts, founded by Danny “Skooby” Morales. This organization is dedicated to educating youth about the five elements of hip-hop: B-boying, MC-ing, DJ-ing, Graffiti Art, and Knowledge. This relationship was created with the understanding that CYPHERS offers an expertise of hip-hop culture that Rising Youth lacks. This partnership also ensures that the interests of youth participants are protected. Furthermore, the goal is to establish a common vocabulary that will allow both partners to benefit from the collaboration in a meaningful fashion, while educating each other in their respective mediums. TYA theatres wishing to produce hip-hop theatre should seek out partnerships with organizations that promote and maintain hip-hop culture. Without these types of partnerships, the risk of hip-hop culture being exploited on stage increases.\nIn the field of TYA, I have observed ‘hip-hop’ being inserted into plays as a trendy way of being ‘accessible’ to young people. There is little to no regard for the elements and principles of hip-hop that serve as a powerful community building tool and emancipatory force. —Xanthia Angel Walker\nThe approach to dramaturgy is another important factor in the production of hip-hop theatre. In antonia, Rising Youth focuses on how the themes in the original source material connect with the elements of hip-hop. The creative team includes a dramaturg and experts from multiple disciplines within the hip-hop community. TYA theatres must focus on dramaturgy that considers the interdisciplinary nature of hip-hop and its improvisational foundation. Dramaturgy should not focus on one element, but rather all elements of hip-hop. This essentially calls for a creative collaboration and exchange of ideas that goes beyond the formal director-dramaturg relationship. The success of a TYA hip-hop performance is dependent on a communal form of dramaturgy that is similar to hip-hop’s cypher, or artistic gathering.\nLastly, acknowledging the importance of community members is key in the process because the hip-hop community continually gets misrepresented. This directive serves the production of antonia quite well, but should be a goal for any TYA theatre wishing to reach wider audiences like traditionally marginalized groups. Rising Youth holds itself accountable to the community-at-large. It does not produce a script of which community participants do not approve. This theatre believes that the community of youth will directly shape the content of its work. Rising Youth hopes to create art that converses with community members, instead of talking down to them. In regards to hip-hop culture, TYA theatres must evaluate how they approach this culturally sensitive subject. TYA theatres must also acknowledge that they have a moral obligation to do so.']	['<urn:uuid:9dceb9b3-ea9b-4ccc-b3f5-a5c828007a62>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	novice	2025-04-22T14:43:01.810270	12	99	1024
4	need help when can person legally die peacefully oregon first usa state allow	Oregon became the first state in the United States with an open practice of aid in dying (AID) in 1998. This occurred after Oregon voters adopted the first AID statute in 1994, though implementation was delayed for several years due to a lawsuit challenging its validity.	"['California adopted the End of Life Option Act (EOLOA) in October 2015, establishing statutory permission for aid in dying (AID), the medical practice in which a physician provides a mentally competent terminally ill patient with a prescription for medication that the patient may ingest to achieve a peaceful death. California was the fourth state to adopt such a statute, following Oregon, Washington and Vermont. Recently, Colorado and the District of Columbia adopted similar measures. All impose a number of burdens and restrictions on accessing AID.\nThe first state to vote on a measure intended to empower terminally ill patients with physician-assisted dying was Washington in 1991. California unsuccessfully tried a similar measure the next year. Opponents argued that there were insufficient ""safeguards"". Voters were swayed by this concern, despite strong public support for AID. Learning from these attempts, Oregonians embraced a \'throw in the kitchen sink\' approach and put forth a measure thick with ""safeguards."" In 1994 Oregon voters adopted the first AID statute in the United States. Implementation of Oregon’s law was delayed for several years, until a lawsuit challenging its validity was resolved late in 1997. Beginning in 1998 Oregon became the first state with an open practice of AID.\nIn 2015 California legislators adopted an Oregon-style AID measure, though slightly more restrictive. While in some ways the EOLOA can be considered a step forward, in others it represents a step backwards. The ""step forward"" perspective recognizes that California is the largest, most populous and most demographically diverse state to adopt an AID law. The ""step backward"" can be seen in the fact the EOLOA imposes all of the burdens and limitations as does the original Oregon Measure and goes beyond in imposing both an additional restriction and a sunset provision.\nOregon’s nearly 20 years experience with AID has been closely watched and studied. The State annually reports on implementation of the program, and a plethora of articles examining and discussing the data have been published. The consensus has emerged that availability of AID improves end-of-life care and presents no risk.\nAccordingly, it would be appropriate for the practice to become more normalized within the practice of medicine, with less government oversight and regulation. The regulation of the practice of medicine is not commonly governed by statute; rather it is primarily governed by professional practice standards as they evolve in practice; in other words—by standard of care. However, the EOLOA is ""Oregon Plus"": imposing all of the intrusive, burdensome government involvement into medical practice that the Oregon statute requires and adding some additional burden and limitation. The obstruction faced by patients is apparent in accounts of families of patients who have attempted to run the gauntlet of requirements in order for the dying patient to achieve a more peaceful death through aid in dying.\nPrior to enactment of the EOLOA, two cases had been filed in California seeking clarification of the reach of California’s statute that makes a crime of ""assisting"" a ""suicide."" Brody v. Harris, Donorovich-O\'Donnell v. Harris. Plaintiffs, patients and physicians, argued that this law should not apply to physicians providing AID because the choice of a dying patient for a peaceful death is not “suicide”; alternatively, plaintiffs argued that the choice at issue deserved protection under California\'s constitutional guarantees of privacy and equal protection. Adoption of the EOLOA mooted the statutory scope claim, as it made clear that physicians who provide aid in dying cannot be prosecuted for ‘assisted suicide.’\nNeither of these cases reached the California Supreme Court. Hence the question of whether state constitutional protection extends to the choice of a dying patient for a more peaceful death through AID has not been resolved. It is this commentator\'s view that the Donorovich court applied law incorrectly and its opinion ought not be persuasive to the California Supreme Court.\nCalifornia courts have repeatedly held that the scope of California\'s constitutional right of personal autonomy privacy is greater than that protected by the federal Constitution. California’s privacy jurisprudence has often been ahead of that of the SCOTUS. California\'s Supreme Court recognized “[t]he fundamental right of [a] woman to choose whether to bear children” in invalidating its ban on abortion four years before the SCOTUS recognized this right in Roe v. Wade.\nJurisprudence concerning reproductive freedom may be especially relevant to AID. California decisions have held the right of a woman to control her body and to choose to terminate a previable pregnancy as ""clearly among the most intimate and fundamental of all constitutional rights."" The right of a woman to control her body has been grounded in the right of privacy. The decision of a dying patient about how much suffering to endure prior to death is of a similar profoundly personal nature, concerning one’s own body, medical treatment, and life course. Because the only life at issue in AID is that of the dying patient, the greatest complexity present in the abortion context—the potential life of the fetus—is absent. Respecting this decision does not result in a reality where doing so ends a potential life with no voice in the decision. Principles that compel respect for a woman’s decision to control her body through abortion apply with equal force to the decision of an individual regarding how much suffering to endure in the final throes of terminal illness, and hence whether to choose AID.\nUnder this approach, the California Supreme Court ought find a privacy or equal protection interest in choosing AID, and hold legislation constraining exercise of this choice to the standard articulated in American Academy of Pediatrics. The State would be required to prove that it has a compelling interest at stake, that it achieves its interest in the least intrusive way, and that the restrictions are narrowly drawn to impinge upon the constitutionally protected area no more than is necessary. It is unlikely that several of the EOLOA provisions could meet this exacting test, including the fifteen-day waiting period. The state might argue that it has an interest in ensuring that a patient’s choice of AID is carefully considered and enduring, and that this interest is served by the waiting period. In the reproductive rights arena at the federal level waiting periods of much shorter duration have been allowed—most commonly twenty-four hours. And, notably, a medical emergency exception to mandatory waiting periods are included, which the EOLOA lacks.\nIn Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the court upheld a state’s twenty-four hour abortion waiting period stating that “only where state regulation imposes an undue burden on a woman\'s ability to make this decision does the power of the State reach into the heart of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.” The court stated that an undue burden exists if “a state regulation has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.” The Court elaborated on the “substantial obstacle” test, stating “the means chosen by the State to further the interest in potential life must be calculated to inform the woman\'s free choice, not hinder it.”\nThe fact that the statute contained an emergency exception to the waiting period was significant, as was absence of findings that a twenty-four hour waiting period created “appreciable health risks.” The EOLOA’s failure to include an emergency exception renders it vulnerable, and certainly imposing a wait period causes the patient harm, as additional suffering must be endured or, even worse, sometimes the patient dies exactly the sort of death hoped to be avoided during the long waiting period.\nA state might assert an interest in ensuring that a patient choosing AID is not acting impulsively and that this interest is served by a waiting period —though why, specifically, the state has an interest in this is unclear. Even if the state establishes an interest, it could be served by a much shorter period. Patients choosing aid in dying do so because they find themselves in an unbearable dying process, where the cumulative burden of suffering imposed by their end stage terminal illness is overwhelming. Forcing them to suffer longer, and possibly be forever denied the right to access aid in dying, seems unjustifiable.\nIf the California Supreme Court reviews restrictions imposed by the EOLOA under a strict scrutiny standard, its jurisprudential history suggests it would almost certainly invalidate a fifteen-day waiting period, and likely other of the EOLOA’s burdensome restrictions. Under the strict scrutiny standard laid out in Roe v. Wade, prior to the undue burden standard expressed in Casey, the court recognized only two state interests as sufficiently compelling to justify governmental restrictions on abortion: the state\'s interests “in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman” and “in protecting the potentiality of human life.” Neither of these sorts of interests are addressed by the restrictions on AID. There is no “health” to protect, as terminal illness by definition destroys health, and there is no potential life interest at stake. Under a strict scrutiny standard, AID regulations would not survive. Even if the more permissive undue burden analysis were to be applied, the fifteen-day waiting period is likely to fail.\nOther elements of the EOLOA may not survive scrutiny: requiring patients to make a written request in addition to the two oral requests, and that they see a consulting physician to confirm diagnosis, prognosis, and competence, delay access to AID. Delays always force additional unwanted suffering and sometimes prevent patients from access entirely, given the progressive nature of their illnesses.\nThe restrictions imposed on AID by the EOLOA will likely be challenged and ultimately examined by the California Supreme Court, which ought find this choice to be protected by privacy and/or equal protection guarantees under the California constitution, and that various restrictions contained in the EOLOA do not survive constitutional scrutiny. Those who believe it is the individual who ought be vested with autonomy to make their own informed decisions about profoundly personal matters involving their own body, life course and medical treatment will applaud such an outcome.\nKathryn L.

5	I heard that gastroenteritis is caused by viruses - can you tell me which specific viruses are responsible for causing it?	Viral gastroenteritis can be caused by several viruses including rotaviruses, toroviruses, adenoviruses, caliciviruses, and astroviruses. Rotavirus is a major cause of gastroenteritis worldwide, while norovirus is a major cause in the United States. About 75% to 90% of gastroenteritis cases are caused by viruses, with the remaining 5% caused by parasites.	"[""Gastroenteritis is one of the serious illnesses that have a significant impact on infants and babies. It occurs when the stomach and intestines are inflamed. In the case of viral gastroenteritis, inflammation is caused by infection with a virus, often accompanied by vomiting or diarrhea. Learn about infantile gastroenteritis.\nGastroenteritis is an infectious disease that affects the gastrointestinal tract. It occurs when pathogens attack the gastrointestinal tract and cause inflammation of the digestive system. This causes the gastrointestinal dysfunction leading to gastroenteritis.\nInfection, especially from the stomach to the colon, can affect all parts of the digestive system. A myriad of bacteria and viruses infect babies.\nA gastroenteritis-causing virus\nViral gastroenteritis is not caused by influenza viruses. Instead, it can be caused by a variety of viruses including rotaviruses, toroviruses, adenoviruses, caliciviruses, and astroviruses.\nAs a result, only about 75% to 90% of the cases of gastroenteritis caused by the virus alone occur. Among them, rotavirus is a major cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. Norovirus is a major example of gastroenteritis in the United States. And the other 5% is caused by parasites.\nThe main pathogens of gastroenteritis are contaminated food and water. There is also a greater risk of infection among babies who consume a variety of other foods than those who breast-feed. Pathogens are usually excreted through the stool when food and water come in contact with infected stools.\nAlso, contaminated items such as toys and toilet seats also carry viruses that cause gastroenteritis. The virus flourishes on these surfaces for several days. And if someone in the family has gastroenteritis, touching the baby 's goods without washing their hands can be transmitted. In conclusion, when infants are infected with pathogens or viruses from all these factors, symptoms of the disease soon appear.\nViral gastroenteritis, however, is not a very serious disease. Even if most of them are sick, they usually recover soon after a certain period of time without long-term problems or side effects. In children, the rate of recovery can vary depending on which virus you have.\nHowever, in order to replace vomiting or diarrhea caused by sickness, a sufficient amount of water should be available for drinking. Otherwise, it can develop into a serious disease. Especially those who can not take care of themselves because of their babies, the elderly, or the disabled are at high risk of dehydration and should pay more attention.\nPeople with impaired immune systems may also have more severe symptoms than healthy people. Vomiting or diarrhea is more frequent. This can also lead to dehydration risk. If some symptoms are severe, you may need to be hospitalized to prevent dehydration.\nViral Gastroenteritis Treatment\nViral gastroenteritis in children and adults is usually treated with dehydration prevention. Dehydration means a lot of body fluids are lost. When a child has enteritis symptoms, parents should ask their doctor how to prevent dehydration and get advice.\nHowever, water is not always a sufficient remedy. Of course water is good in itself, but in some cases it may not be enough. For example, water can not replace electrolytes such as salt, sugar, and minerals that can be lost when the body is dehydrated. Beverages that can replace salt or minerals can be purchased at pharmacies, such as electrolytic solutions or oral water supply solutions. Some sports drinks also have the ability to replace electrolytes. Of course, it contains a lot of sugar, but it does not give much to most school-aged children.\nOn the other hand, milk should be kept away. Milk can make gastroenteritis worse. In addition, it is preferable to avoid beverages or caffeinated beverages containing a lot of acid because they can cause discomfort.\nAnd when you feed such a drink containing water and various electrolytes, it is advisable not to enter too quickly. If it is absorbed into the body too soon, it can worsen vomiting and should be taken as slowly as possible. The best way to do this is with a teaspoon every 4-5 minutes.\nFood should also be adjusted to eat slowly. Once you have had a good drink, you should try adding soft foods such as banana, bread, rice, apple sauce or toast. Chicken soup and noodles with noodles are also good. And if the condition improves gradually, you can feed the cooked meat or vegetables. However, fried or spicy foods, greasy or sour foods should not be eaten for a while.\nIt is good to skip medicines during the treatment period. Although you may think you should take a prescription-free medicine, gastroenteritis can eventually be resolved over time. Most medications also have a different risk of worsening the condition. With vomiting and diarrhea, the body fights infection while eliminating everything in the body. It is desirable to make the process self-healing by retaining sufficient water without stopping with the drug.""]"	['<urn:uuid:d7c6cf83-351d-40b8-8216-34098c592495>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	novice	2025-04-22T14:43:01.810270	21	51	803
