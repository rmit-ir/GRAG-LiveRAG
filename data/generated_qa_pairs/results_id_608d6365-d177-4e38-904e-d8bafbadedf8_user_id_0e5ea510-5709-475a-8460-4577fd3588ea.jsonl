{"question":"brain damage effects personality speech processing consequences","answer":"Brain damage can have profound effects on both personality and speech processing. This is demonstrated by two notable cases. First, Phineas Gage, who suffered damage to his left frontal lobe, experienced dramatic personality changes from being mild-mannered to becoming mean-spirited and vulgar, despite maintaining physical functions. Second, damage to the temporal lobe, particularly around Wernicke's area, can cause transcortical sensory aphasia, which severely impacts language comprehension. People with this condition can still produce fluent speech but may use ungrammatical constructions and invented words. They can repeat what others say but cannot understand the meaning, and may experience reading difficulties and naming problems.","context":["Containing an average of 86 billion neurons, the brain is one of the most complex and inexplicable organs in the human body. In this article, you\u2019ll be learning about the major lobes of the brain and their respective functions.\nFun fact: It\u2019s not true that we use 10% of our brain. No study has ever claimed that. We actually lack the full knowledge of the brain\u2019s capabilities and it keeps us from understanding its true potential.\nWe\u2019ve yet to uncover a deeper understanding of the brain, and in the future, we might be able to access some hidden brain functions.\nSo, let\u2019s uncover a bit of what we know today and learn about the lobes of the brain and their functions.\nWhere \u201cYou\u201d Reside \u2013 a Break Down of the Lobes of the Brain\nEver wonder what makes you, well\u2026you! Your brain is where your mind and consciousness are thought to be located. Everything you are from your thoughts, memories, feelings, and behaviors are sitting in that magnificent brain of yours.\nBefore we jump on the topic of the lobes of the brain, we\u2019ll need to first get a grasp on just how much your mind has physical roots in your brain.\nThe case of Phineas Gage\u2019s brain injury\nIn 1848, a man named Phineas Gage was working on the railroad, tamping gunpowder into a blasting hole with an iron rod, and accidentally ignited the gunpowder.\nThe explosion caused the rod to shoot through the left side of his face and through his head, destroying much of his brain\u2019s left frontal lobe.\nAmazingly after the accident, he stood up, walked over, and described what had happened \u2013 all while being conscious.\nThe doctor that examined him at the time refused to believe that a rod had shot through his head until Gage coughed out what was described to be a teacupful amount of brain.\nSurprisingly after a few months, he was healed up and moving around just fine. However, his friends reported that he was no longer like himself.\nThe old Gage was mild-mannered and pleasant. After the accident though, he became mean-spirited and vulgar, or as his friends and coworkers described him \u201cno longer Gage.\u201d\nYour brain essentially encompasses everything about what makes you a person, from personality to your thinking. Phineas Gage\u2019s story is an example of how much we are yet to understand our brain\u2019s functions and capabilities.\nThe 4 Major Lobes of the Brain and Their Functions\nThe cerebral cortex is the outermost layer of the brain. It is divided lengthways into two cerebral hemispheres and is connected by a band of nerve fibers (corpus callosum) that allow both sides to communicate with one another.\nEach of the hemispheres is divided into four parts: frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe.\nAlthough most of our brain functions rely on multiple regions communicating in conjunction with one another, each lobe of the brain is thought to carry out the bulk of a certain set of functions.\nThe frontal lobe is where most of your everyday planning and self-management take place, such as emotional regulation, higher planning, and problem-solving. It helps facilitate body movement and memory consolidation.\nMoreover, the left frontal lobe is in charge of speech production and word comprehension.\nThe parietal lobe is responsible for signals of pain perception, sense of touch, and feelings of pressure. The ability to perceive different sensations played a great role in our evolution. Without the feeling of pain, our bodies can\u2019t let us know that we are in a dangerous situation.\nToday, we know about congenital insensitivity to pain or CIP, a condition when a person can\u2019t feel any pain which can be quite dangerous for their wellbeing. So, as you can see, the proper function of the parietal lobe is quite important.\nThe main task of the temporal lobe is to transmit and process signals coming to the primary auditory cortex. In other words, it allows us to make a distinction between different types of sounds or languages. But what does the temporal lobe do that the other lobes of the brain cannot? It allows us to learn, feel, and remember.\nThe temporal lobe consists of the left temporal lobe and the right temporal lobe. The primary function of the left temporal lobe is to manage sight and sound processing, while the right side controls visual memory and language comprehension.\nThe primary function of the occipital lobe is to decode the visual information it receives by processing it and sending it back to our eyes. The main vision center is located in the occipital lobe, and it allows us to distinguish the shapes and ranges of the objects we see.\nFor a moment, acknowledge and honor all that you are instead of all that you are not.\u2014 Jim Kwik, trainer of Mindvalley\u2019s Superbrain Quest\nThese are the main functions of each lobe of the brain. Without any of them, a human being is not able to function adequately in the physical world.\nApart from lobes, we should also give a mention to the sensory cortex. It lies within the parietal lobe and plays an important role in \u201cconnecting\u201d all our senses together.\nAlso located within the frontal lobe is the motor cortex. The primary role of the motor cortex function is to define the way we move. All of these areas work together with our four lobes to help us interact with our physical environment.\nThe brain, the master of organs, one that encompasses all the things you were, are, and eventually will be. We are still so far from having a deep understanding of this marvel and the complex mysteries that lay within.\nSoon the day will come when we\u2019ve learned to tap into the full power of the brain, and only then will we be able to take advantage of its full capacity and potential.","There are many types of aphasia, which is a communication disorder caused by neurological injury. One type of aphasia, called transcortical sensory aphasia, can cause poor auditory comprehension. It most commonly occurs after damage to the temporal lobe.\nFortunately, the nervous system has a natural ability to heal and rewire itself after injury. This means that speech difficulties like transcortical sensory aphasia can often be rehabilitated, and this guide will walk you through the process.\nUse the links below to jump straight to any section:\n- Causes of Transcortical Sensory Aphasia\n- Transcortical Sensory Aphasia Symptoms\n- Diagnosing Sensory Aphasia\n- Management of Transcortical Sensory Aphasia\n- Understanding Transcortical Sensory Aphasia\nCauses of Transcortical Sensory Aphasia\nThe process of language is complex. Different areas of the brain control different aspects of language, such as processing spoken words or understanding written words, for example.\nThe part of the brain responsible for comprehending language is known as Wernicke\u2019s area and is located in the left temporal lobe.\nWhen a temporal lobe stroke or brain injury damages the tissue surrounding Wernicke\u2019s area, this can isolate it from the rest of the brain. As a result, problems with language comprehension can occur. Doctor\u2019s call this type of language difficulty transcortical sensory aphasia.\nThe most common cause of transcortical sensory aphasia is a watershed stroke, which is a stroke that affects one or more of the watershed regions of the brain. These regions are located far from the major cerebral arteries in the brain. Because they are so isolated from the arterial supply, they are especially vulnerable to a decrease in blood flow.\nThe carotid artery is one of the main arteries that supply blood to the areas surrounding Wernicke\u2019s area. Therefore, when a stroke occurs in this artery, it can severely damage these areas and lead to sensory aphasia.\nTranscortical Sensory Aphasia Symptoms\nTranscortical sensory aphasia (TSA) is essentially the opposite of motor aphasia. With this type, the person can still produce fluent speech. However, their speech might be ungrammatical and peppered with invented words. This can make it nearly impossible for others to understand.\nTSA is most similar to Wernicke\u2019s aphasia in that it impairs a person\u2019s ability to comprehend spoken language. Unlike Wernicke\u2019s aphasia, however, the person can repeat what they hear another say, although they do not understand it. Therefore, if you asked the person to say \u201cI would like some water\u201d they could repeat that phrase almost verbatim, but they would not comprehend what any of those words mean.\nSensory aphasia is caused by damage to the parts of the temporal lobe that surround Wernicke\u2019s area. Other symptoms of transcortical sensory aphasia include:\n- Reading difficulties\n- Naming problems\n- Paraphasia (error-prone speech)\n- Echolalia (compulsively repeating what others say)\nLike transcortical motor aphasia, TSA can vary in severity, depending on how extensive the brain damage is. For example, some patients might only have difficulty understanding long or complex sentences, while others might be unable to understand even simple words.\nDiagnosing Sensory Aphasia\nSensory aphasia cannot be diagnosed using imaging techniques, because the results are often inconclusive. Therefore, neurologists or speech pathologists will typically administer oral speech evaluations to determine the patient\u2019s type of aphasia.\nOne test commonly used in diagnosis is the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Exam, which specializes in determining the severity of sensory aphasia. Therapists engage in conversation with the patient and observe their responses.\nOnce a diagnosis is made, the course of treatment can begin.\nManagement of Transcortical Sensory Aphasia\nTherapists use a variety of techniques to improve auditory comprehension in transcortical sensory aphasia patients. These techniques include:\n- Using common words\n- Focusing more on concrete nouns rather than adjectives or adverbs\n- Using gestures\n- Using concise and grammatically simple sentences\n- Speaking slowly and repeating themselves several times\nIt is critical for patients to begin speech therapy right away, as the sooner they begin therapy, the more likely they are to recover their language comprehension.\nThis can occur because the brain possesses a natural repair mechanism known as neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity allows the brain to rewire itself and transfer functions from damaged areas to healthy ones. This can enable the person to regain their lost function.\nThe most effective way to engage neuroplasticity is through intensive repetition. Therefore, by practicing speech therapy, the patient can increase their chances of recovering their language comprehension.\nTo practice speech therapy every day, it can help to use speech therapy apps, such as the CT Speech & Cognitive Therapy App. This app was specially designed by speech therapists to improve a patient\u2019s language production and comprehension skills and features over 100,000 customizable exercises.\nUnderstanding Transcortical Sensory Aphasia\nDamage to the temporal lobe surrounding Wernicke\u2019s area can lead to transcortical sensory aphasia and cause a person to lose their ability to understand language. They also will struggle to produce meaningful words and phrases. However, they can still repeat words and phrases that they hear.\nPeople with sensory aphasia might not realize they have any deficits, and might be confused about why they can no longer communicate. If left untreated, this can lead to feelings of isolation and depression.\nIf symptoms do not improve on their own, a speech therapist can help you find tactics to increase the person\u2019s language skills. Intensive practice of speech therapy drills are the most effective ways to accomplish this, but there may also be other techniques that your therapist can suggest."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"factuality","category_name":"open-ended"},{"categorization_name":"premise","category_name":"direct"},{"categorization_name":"phrasing","category_name":"long-search-query"},{"categorization_name":"linguistic_variation","category_name":"distant-from-document"},{"categorization_name":"multi-doc","category_name":"multi-aspect"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"expertise-categorization","category_name":"novice"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f346d068-d89c-4ca4-8bba-df4233f5dac5>","<urn:uuid:05248082-fbed-4894-9ab6-665250eb0c16>"],"error":null}
{"question":"form u4 arbitration provisions compared transportation worker arbitration agreements legal status differences","answer":"Form U-4 arbitration provisions in the securities industry can be circumvented by participating in class actions under FINRA rules, while transportation worker arbitration agreements can be avoided completely under FAA section 1 exceptions if the worker is engaged in interstate commerce, regardless of whether they are an employee or independent contractor. These represent different legal frameworks for avoiding arbitration, with FINRA rules being specific to class actions and the FAA exceptions providing broader protection for transportation workers.","context":["In an apparent case of first impression, Judge Harold Baer of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, denied defendants\u2019 motion to compel the arbitration of a collective and class action for overtime pay filed by financial advisors under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d) and the New York Labor Law (\u201cNYLL\u201d).\nIn Zeltser, et. al v. Merril Lynch, 13 CV 1531, Judge Baer rejected motions to compel arbitration filed by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc; and Bank of America Corporation. In Zeltser, former and current Financial Solutions Advisors (\u201cFSAs\u201d) alleged that they were entitled to overtime pay for working overtime hours. FSAs were required to register with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) and sign a Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer, which is referred to as a \u201cForm U-4.\u201d\nForm U-4s contain an arbitration clause requiring registered representatives, like the FSAs, to \u201cagree to arbitrate any dispute, claim or controversy that may arise between [the registered representative] and [his or her] firm. . . .that is required to be arbitrated under the rules, constitutions or by-laws of [FINRA]. . . .\u201d However, FINRA rules, which also govern Form U-4s, provide that an agreement to arbitrate may not be enforced against any registered representative who is a \u201cmember of a certified or putative class action with respect to \u201cany claim that is the subject of the certified or putative class action until: [t]he class certification is denied, [t]he class is decertified; [t]he member of the certified or putative class is excluded from the class by the court; or [t]he member of the certified or putative class elects not to participate in the class or withdraws from the class according to conditions set by the court, if any.\u201d\nIn addition, FINRA Rule 12304(b)(4) provides that \u201c[a] member or associated person may not enforce an agreement to arbitrate in this forum against a member of a certified or putative collective action with respect to any claim that is the subject of the certified or putative collective action until the collective action certification is denied or the collective action is decertified.\u201d These rules clearly preclude the enforcement of the arbitration provisions at issue to class action participants. Nevertheless, defendants argued that the FINRA Rules were preempted (or superseded) by the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d), and that therefore the FAA, which permits arbitrations of class disputes, trumped the FINRA Rules prohibiting them. Judge Baer rejected this argument, stating that \u201c[n]either the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit has held that FINRA is preempted by the FAA in a fact pattern such as the one before me.\u201d\nIn recent years, courts have strongly favored the enforcement of pre-dispute arbitration clauses, which generally prevent a claimant from going to court in favor of a private arbitration. Zeltser demonstrates, however, the enforcement of such clauses is not without limits, and that in order to hold a party to an arbitration clause, the claim at issue must also be deemed arbitrable under all relevant statutes, rules and regulations.","New Prime v. Oliveira: What Does It Mean For Arbitration Agreements?\nOn January 15, 2019 the United States Supreme Court released its decision in New Prime v. Oliveira, and for what was likely the first time in almost two decades, the Court did not enforce an arbitration agreement. In its unanimous decision, the Supreme Court expanded the reach of the Federal Arbitration Act\u2019s section 1 exceptions, allowing a bigger group of individuals to circumvent their arbitration agreements and bring their claims directly to court.\nSo, what does this case mean for business owners and employees? Arbitration around Phoenix is a popular legal topic, especially when it comes to employment agreements and disputes. Does this new case render arbitration agreements worthless? Do employees suddenly have the upper hand when it comes to their arbitration agreements? This article will fill you in on everything you need to know about this decision, whether you are an employer or an employee.\nBackground: the FAA and New Prime\nThe New Prime case has to do with the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d), which enforces contractual arbitration provisions. Most commonly, and relevant here, this includes arbitration clauses found in employment agreements, which are widespread today. In New Prime, Mr. Oliveira was hired by New Prime as a truck driver. Initially, Mr. Oliveira was hired as an independent contractor, and signed an employment agreement with New Prime that stated that in the event of a dispute between them, the matter would go to arbitration instead of going to court. Additionally, the agreement held that an arbitrator, not a court, would determine whether potential disputes could be arbitrated. During his employment with New Prime, Mr. Oliveira was regularly paid in such a way that he was not receiving the minimum wage required by law, and so he brought suit against New Prime in a class action lawsuit. New Prime brought up the arbitration provision in the employment agreement, saying the case needed to be taken out of court and arbitrated. Mr. Oliveira pointed to section 1 of the FAA, which exempts \u201ctransportation employees\u201d involved in interstate commerce. New Prime countered that Mr. Oliveira was an independent contractor, not an employee. However, New Prime argued that pursuant to their agreement, an arbitrator should decide whether the issue was subject to arbitration, and whether section 1 of the FAA applied. These two issues made their way to the Supreme Court, where the Court held that the language of the FAA indicated that independent contractors as well as employees could be considered \u201ctransportation workers,\u201d and therefore exempt from the arbitration requirements of the FAA. The Court also held that a court, not an arbitrator, should decide whether section 1 of the FAA applied, regardless of any arbitration agreement, because if section 1 applied in the first place, those workers were exempt from arbitration, even to determine whether arbitration was appropriate.\nWhen the decision was handed down by the Court, some commentators discussed the possibility that this case would be a basis for allowing massive amounts of employees to be exempted from compulsory arbitration under FAA section 1. They pointed to Justice Ginsberg, who had agreed with the decision but also filed a concurring opinion in which she stated that the policy goals of the FAA were to exclude a much wider group of employees from compulsory arbitration agreements, even if the text of the statute was less clear. This was not the first time that Justice Ginsberg had voiced this opinion, and legal commentators have commented that New Prime might be the case to begin exempting more and more employees from arbitration agreements.\nWhat New Prime does and what it does not do\nNew Prime does expand the section 1 exceptions of the FAA. It does not, however, expand them as far as many might have feared. New Prime in no way changed or overruled the class of workers, \u201ctransportation workers,\u201d that are excluded under FAA section 1. Workers need to be \u201ctransportation workers\u201d engaged in interstate commerce to be exempted from arbitration requirements under the FAA.\nNew Prime does, however, expand FAA section 1 exceptions to independent contractors who are transportation workers engaged in interstate commerce. Under the case, the modern technical differences between an employee and an independent contractor do not matter when it comes to determining whether a worker is exempt under FAA section 1. This means that many more people will be exempt from FAA arbitration requirements. However, this will be limited to industries involved in interstate transportation only and will not affect all industries involved in interstate commerce, which would be essentially every modern American business.\nWhat does it mean for you or your business?\nThe reality is, unless you are working in the interstate transportation industry, New Prime probably is not a huge deal for you. The decision is an important one from the Supreme Court and could be an indication of future changes in arbitration jurisprudence, but all of that is speculation. Concretely, New Prime will impact only businesses and workers involved in interstate transportation.\nIf you do happen to be a business owner or employer working in the interstate transportation industry, you do need to be aware of this case and its implications. Prior to New Prime, workers could be employed as independent contractors to keep them out of the FAA section 1 exception. Now, those workers\u2019 status as independent contractors will be considered equivalent to an employees\u2019 exempt status. Therefore, all of your workers, regardless of technical status as independent contractor or employee, will have the option to avoid any potential arbitration agreements and bring their claims directly to court. This is something you need to be aware of as a business owner, especially if you have relied heavily on arbitration in the past. Although arbitration may still be an option if workers are willing to arbitrate, following New Prime those workers have the right to bring their claims to court and avoid arbitration if they so choose.\nIf, on the other hand, you are employed in the interstate transportation industry as an independent contractor or other worker, New Prime means that you may no longer be bound by any arbitration agreements you may have entered into with your employer. If you have claims you may want to bring to court, New Prime now allows you to do so and avoid arbitration. Now that the FAA section 1 exceptions extend to you, you cannot be bound to compulsory arbitration and may bring claims against your employer directly in court, including through a class action suit.\nNew Prime is undoubtedly a big Supreme Court case, and has a very real and significant impact, but only for a limited range of businesses and individuals in America. For those businesses and individuals working in interstate transportation, this case will certainly cause significant changes in the way disputes between employers and workers are resolved. By extending the FAA\u2019s section 1 exceptions to a wider class of transportation workers, arbitration will no longer monopolize dispute resolution, and workers will be better able to bring claims against their employers in court.\nSince New Prime is such a new case, however, it is difficult to know exactly the impact it will have on businesses and workers. Skilled business attorneys with experience dealing with arbitration matters can assist you in navigating this new arbitration framework, whether you are a business owner or an employee. The attorneys at Denton Peterson Dunn, PLLC have been handling business and arbitration matters for decades, and have the experience and skill needed to make sure you are protected under the law."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"factuality","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise","category_name":"direct"},{"categorization_name":"phrasing","category_name":"long-search-query"},{"categorization_name":"linguistic_variation","category_name":"similar-to-document"},{"categorization_name":"multi-doc","category_name":"comparison"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"expertise-categorization","category_name":"expert"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:fe2e50f4-e020-41ec-8ae7-cd2d739b8aa6>","<urn:uuid:2c3c7c8a-0c40-42b8-b2b6-65c704ef8625>"],"error":null}
{"question":"motor neuron disease treatment prospects inheritance","answer":"While there is currently no effective treatment for ALS and its causes are known in only 10% of patients with inherited forms, recent research has identified the SYT13 gene as a promising therapeutic candidate that protects motor neurons regardless of genetic causes. For SMA, which is caused by SMN1 gene mutations, two new therapies have recently been approved, though new complementary treatments are still needed. Carrier screening is recommended for all couples considering pregnancy, with carrier frequencies varying significantly among ethnic groups.","context":["Gene found to protect motor neurons against degeneration\nResults of an international collaboration show promise for the future of motor neurone disease treatment efforts, as protective gene is identified.\nResearchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and the University of Milan in Italy have identified a gene in human neurons that protects against the degeneration of motor neurons in two of the progressive motor neuron diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Mouse models have demonstrated the success of gene therapy in preventing cell death and increasing life span in these diseases.\nALS and SMA are characterised by a gradual loss of motor neurons, which manifests in loss of muscle function, including paralysis, for which there is currently no treatment. However, some motor neurons are more sensitive than others: those in the spinal cord, for example, are extremely sensitive to degeneration, while the ocular motor neurons in the brain stem, which we use to move our eyes, are highly resistant.\nThe Europe-based researchers have identified a gene, Synaptotagmin 13 (SYT13), that is relatively abundant in resistant oculomotor neurons in mice, rats and humans compared with the sensitive motor neurons in the spinal cord. SYT13 codes for a protein that belongs to a group of membrane proteins.\nIn experiments with human motor neurons produced from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) taken from ALS and SMA patients, the researchers were able to show that cells were protected when the SYT13 gene was introduced.\nThe gene promoted a protective effect regardless of the genetic causes of the diseases.\n\u201cThis is extremely useful from a therapeutic perspective, since the mechanisms behind neuronal loss are largely unknown in 90 percent of all ALS patients and can differ from one individual to another,\u201d says Eva Hedlund, researcher at the Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet and one of the senior authors of the study.\nOn conducting gene therapy experiments in animal models of ALS and SMA, the team was then able to show that the introduction of SYT13 saves sensitive motor neurons from degeneration in both diseases. The treated mice also lived up to 50 percent longer in the case of SMA and 14 percent longer with ALS.\n\u201cOur results suggest that SYT13 is a very promising gene therapy candidate for patients with motor neuron disease,\u201d says Monica Nizzardo, researcher of the Centro Dino Ferrari, University of Milan, IRCCS Fondazione Ca\u2019 Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, and first author of the study.\nThere are currently no effective treatments for ALS and its causes are known in only the 10 percent of patients with the inherited form of the disease. SMA, however, is caused by mutations in a gene called survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1), for which two new therapies have recently been approved.\n\u201cNew complementary treatments for SMA and a form of therapy that helps all patients with ALS, regardless of pathogenesis, are needed,\u201d says Stefania Corti, researcher of the Centro Dino Ferrari, University of Milan, IRCCS Fondazione Ca\u2019 Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, and other senior author of the study.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue looking for additional factors that are unique to resistant motor neurons, and thus identify more potential therapeutic targets,\u201d says Eva Hedlund.\nThe study was published in Acta Neuropathologica.","Background: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the most common inherited lethal disease of children. Various genetic deletions involving the bi-allelic loss of SMN1 exon 7 are reported to account for 94% of affected individuals. Published literature places the carrier frequency for SMN1 mutations between 1 in 25 and 1 in 50 in the general population. Although SMA is considered to be a pan-ethnic disease, carrier frequencies for many ethnicities, including most ethnic groups in North America, are unknown.\nObjectives and methods: To provide an accurate assessment of SMN1 mutation carrier frequencies in African American, Ashkenazi Jewish, Asian, Caucasian, and Hispanic populations, more than 1000 specimens in each ethnic group were tested using a clinically validated, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that measures exon 7 copy number.\nResults: The observed one-copy genotype frequency was 1 in 37 (2.7%) in Caucasian, 1 in 46 (2.2%) in Ashkenazi Jew, 1 in 56 (1.8%) in Asian, 1 in 91 (1.1%) in African American, and 1 in 125 (0.8%) in Hispanic specimens. Additionally, an unusually high frequency of alleles with multiple copies of SMN1 was identified in the African American group (27% compared to 3.3\u20138.1%). This latter finding has clinical implications for providing accurate adjusted genetic risk assessments to the African American population.\nConclusions: Differences in the frequency of SMA carriers were significant among several ethnic groups. This study provides an accurate assessment of allele frequencies and estimates of adjusted genetic risk that were previously unavailable to clinicians and patients considering testing.\nStatistics from Altmetric.com\nIf you wish to reuse any or all of this article please use the link below which will take you to the Copyright Clearance Center\u2019s RightsLink service.

This is considerably higher than other populations and results in a SMA carrier adjusted risk estimate that is five times greater than that of the Caucasian population.\nThis study provides accurate estimates of allele frequency and adjusted genetic risk for five major ethnic groups in North America.\nWith an incidence of 1 in 6000 to 1 in 10 000 live births, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the most common lethal genetic disease of children.1 SMA is a neuromuscular disorder that leads to progressive, proximal muscle weakness and atrophy. Sixty per cent of individuals affected with SMA have the most severe form, type I, also known as Werdnig\u2013Hoffman disease (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) 253300), with clinical onset usually occurring before 6 months and death by respiratory failure before the age of 2 years. Clinical onset of type II SMA (OMIM 253550) usually occurs by the age of 15 months with most cases surviving beyond 10 years of age. Type II patients may learn to sit, but never gain the ability to walk. Type III SMA (OMIM 253400) is a milder form with onset typically occurring between 2 and 17 years of age. An adult form of SMA (type IV, OMIM 271150) has also been described.\nSMA is caused by mutations in the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) gene.2 The SMN1 gene resides in a duplicated region of chromosome 5q13 telomeric to the near identical homologue SMN2. More than 90% of the functional SMN protein is contributed by SMN1. Comparably SMN2 produces only a small fraction of SMN due to a point mutation in exon 7 that disrupts an exon splice enhancer site, preventing normal post-transcription processing.3 4 In the general population the copy number of SMN1 and SMN2 genes varies. Published information suggests that 85\u201395% of the population has one copy of the SMN1 gene per allele; however, individuals with more than one copy per allele have been identified.5 6 7 8 9 10 Ninety-four per cent of affected individuals possess bi-allelic mutations involving various deletion mutations that share the loss of SMN1 exon 7. Of the remaining 6% of SMA cases, most are attributed to a variety of rare molecular lesions distributed throughout the gene, including point mutations, small insertions, and deletions. A minority of cases may involve genes other than SMN1.11 Additionally, there is an inverse correlation between SMN2 copy number and disease severity, such that affected individuals with three or more copies of SMN2 typically have milder forms of the disease.12 This mutation spectrum permits sensitive detection of carriers through the analysis of SMN1 exon 7 copy number by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).5 13 14 In calculating the mean from the results of their own and other published research, Ogino et al reported a frequency for one-copy carriers at approximately 1 in 40 individuals in the general population.15 In addition to the low prevalence mutations distributed across the gene, another small subset of carriers cannot be identified by exon 7 copy measurement since they have one allele with two SMN1 copies paired with a zero-copy allele (hereafter referred to as \u201c2+0\u201d genotype). By exon 7 quantification these individuals are indistinguishable from wild-type (or \u201c1+1\u201d genotype). It has been estimated that approximately 1 in 600 apparent two-copy specimens may be \u201c2+0\u201d carriers.16\nRecently published guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) recommend universal carrier screening for SMA.17 Before this guidance, carrier screening in the USA was offered primarily to family members of individuals diagnosed with SMA. SMA is considered to be pan-ethnic; however, published studies to date have involved small and heterogeneous sample sets.5 6 7 8 15 16 Even the few studies addressing specific races provide insufficient information to support the calculation of carrier frequencies and risk assessments with the precision warranted by widespread carrier screening.14 18 19 20\nTo address this need for accurate allele frequency data, more than 1000 samples from five major ethnic groups, African American, Ashkenazi Jewish, Asian, Caucasian and Hispanic, were tested for SMN1 copy number. These ethnicities are relevant since they comprise >95% of the North American population at large and the North American patients electing to participate in genetic testing (2006 US Census estimates).\nSamples were collected from residual material following routine clinical testing of individuals presumed to have no family history of SMA. All specimens were made completely anonymous before testing in accordance with approved institutional protocols. Ethnic assignment relied upon patient reported data that were not collected as part of complete family histories. However, these ethnic assignments, which reflect clinical practice, are therefore highly representative of the anticipated clinical experience for SMA carrier screening. The assessment of SMN1 exon 7 copy number employed a clinically validated, real-time, quantitative PCR assay specific for the single nucleotide change in exon 7 (cd 840 c>t). All reported results could be assigned to validated, non-overlapping genotype groups of 1, 2 or 3 SMN1 copies (the three copies group includes samples with three or more SMN1 gene copies).\nSignificant differences in the frequencies of SMN1 genotypes were observed among several ethnicities (table 1). The highest one-copy carrier rate was identified in specimens from the Caucasian group with a frequency of 1 in 37 samples (2.7%). This result agrees closely with those previously reporting on European populations.6 7 The 1.8% carrier frequency detected in the Asian sample group is comparable to the 1.6% and 1.9% that have been reported in Southern Chinese populations.14 20 The African American and Hispanic groups had statistically significant lower one-copy carrier genotypes when compared to Caucasians, at 1 in 90 (1.1%, p = 0.0089) and 1 in 125 (0.8%, p = 0.0007), respectively. These are the lowest SMN1 carrier frequencies reported for any population or ethnic group at this time. For all but the African American group, the two-copy genotype was more than five times more prevalent than the three-copy genotype group. This result is consistent with all previously published data showing the two-copy genotype to be predominant. Surprisingly, the African American population departed significantly from this genotype distribution, revealing similar frequencies for the two- and three-copy genotypes (52.1% and 46.8% respectively), suggesting a much higher frequency of alleles with two or more SMN1 copies than the other four ethnic groups. These unexpected results in this group were confirmed by retesting 10% of the samples using multiplexed ligation dependant probe amplification (MLPA, MRC Holland, The Netherlands) as an alternate technique. All MLPA results were concordant with the original real-time PCR data.\nUsing the observed genotype data and assuming Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium, maximum likelihood estimation was employed to determine frequencies for alleles and allele pairings within all sample groups (tables 2 and 3). These calculations reveal that the expected frequency of alleles with two or more copies of SMN1 in the African American group is 3.4 to 8.4 times more prevalent when compared to the other ethnic groups. The preponderance of the two-copy allele in the African American group also suggests a much higher frequency of individuals with the SMA carrier \u201c2+0\u201d genotype compared to other ancestries.\nAdjusted carrier risk assessment estimates have been previously published based on aggregate results of several studies.15 16 These estimates calculate the probability of being an SMA carrier when an individual without a family history of SMA receives a test result showing two or more SMN1 copies. These calculations account for rare mutations undetectable by the method described here, and model the \u201c2+0\u201d carrier genotype. Adjusted carrier risk was calculated for each ethnic group based on its unique allele frequencies (table 4). The result for the Caucasian population (1:632) is similar to that previously reported by Smith et al (1:648).16 In that report calculations were based on data from a compilation of studies from countries in Europe, USA, and Australia. The adjusted risk estimate in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (1:350) is approximately two times higher than the Caucasian group because of the higher frequency of two-copy alleles. As expected, the unusually high frequency of two-copy alleles in the African American population produces an adjusted risk factor more than five times greater than that of Caucasians or Asians. Additionally, a \u201c3+0\u201d genotype carrier has been previously inferred but not been formally demonstrated by molecular techniques.15 The adjusted carrier risk calculations for the three-copy genotype are presented in the right hand column of table 4. Finally, using these calculated frequencies, the negative predictive value and detection rate were determined for real-time PCR quantification of exon 7 as a screening method for each ethnic group (table 5).\nThe genetic basis for the unusually high SMN1 copy number in the African American population is unknown. Previously published data have shown that individuals with higher copy numbers of SMN1 tend to have fewer copies of SMN2.22 It has been suggested that this correlation indicates that SMN2 may have converted to SMN1; however, the inverse may also be true. Alleles with multiple copies of SMN1 may be the ancestral form of the duplication, with conversion to SMN2 a more recent mutation event. An assessment of SMN2 copy number is currently underway to understand the SMN1\/SMN2 correlation in this sample set.\nPrediction of disease phenotype in SMA is complicated by the modifying effects of SMN2 copy number, as well as other genes such as plastin 3.23 Additionally, there is not a completely predictive correlation between phenotype and modifiers. Similar to other autosomal diseases with variable phenotypes, SMA carrier screening results cannot predict the disease phenotype for offspring. Although this study has demonstrated that significant differences exist in SMA carrier frequency between several ethnic groups, an assessment of pregnancy outcomes data for these populations will be needed to determine if disease frequencies or phenotype incidences also vary. More widespread carrier screening will aid in identifying couples at risk of having SMA offspring and allow for appropriate follow-up to answer these questions.\nThe recent ACMG guideline for SMA carrier screening17 recommends that since SMA is present in all populations, carrier testing should be offered to couples regardless of race or ethnicity who are pregnant or considering pregnancy. The results from this study provide precise estimates of allele frequencies and genotypes that vary significantly among ethnic groups. The implications of this work are most significant for Hispanic patients who carry lower risks of SMN1 mutations and for African American patients who bear increased frequencies of two-copy alleles. These data will facilitate the accurate interpretation of clinical testing results and provide additional information for genetic counselling.\nCompeting interests All authors, except C S, declare the potential for duality of interest because they are employed by, and receive salaries from, Genzyme Genetics, the institution that funded this research.

{"question":"likelihood of gaining versus losing money with blue chip long call options","answer":"For an out-of-the-money long call on a blue-chip stock, with a breakeven price requiring a 12-point increase, the probability of being profitable at expiration is only about 12%. This means the odds are about 88% that you will lose money, and about 81% that you will lose all your money if held until expiration.","context":["- Trading always involves some level of risk, but \u201crisk\u201d can be defined in many different ways.\n- Is it the probability of profit compared to the probability of loss? Or is it the amount you could earn compared to the amount you could lose?\n- Plus, how do you quantify risk? Is it the number of shares or the dollar amount?\nIs options trading risky? This is a harder question to answer than you might think, because it depends upon how you define \u201crisk.\u201d\nMost traders define risk in one of two ways. The first method is the probability of earning a profit versus the probability of incurring a loss. The second way is the amount of money you could lose compared to the amount of money you could earn. Let\u2019s look at both.\nProbability of profit vs. probability of loss\nFor traders who define risk as the probability of profit vs. probability of loss, the amount at risk is generally a lesser consideration, because a loss is not anticipated. This type of trader will typically focus on strategies in which the probability of profit is much higher than the probability of loss. Assuming the trader\u2019s forecast on the underlying security is ultimately correct, a single use of any of the following strategies would generally be considered low risk:\n- Any buy\/write strategy\n- A deep in-the-money long call\n- A deep in-the-money long put\n- A far out-of-the-money naked call\n- A far out-of-the-money naked (or cash secured) put\nAmount you could lose vs. amount you could earn\nThis is also sometimes called the risk-to-reward ratio. For traders who define risk this way, the fact that a profit of any kind is unlikely, is generally a lesser consideration, because the amount at risk is considered very small. This type of trader will typically only consider trades in which the potential gain is much higher than the potential loss. Assuming the trader\u2019s forecast on the underlying security is ultimately correct; a single use of any of the following strategies would generally be considered low risk:\n- An out-of-the-money long call\n- An out-of-the-money long put\n- An out-of-the-money long strangle\n- A lottery ticket\n- A long position in a penny stock\nNote: For the purposes of all following examples, assume that the probability of expiration and the breakeven point are at the moment the trade is placed. All profits and losses are before commissions.\nLet\u2019s look at an example and see whether it\u2019s a \u201crisky\u201d trade. Our hypothetical example is a buy\/write of XYZ, a highly rated, \u201cblue-chip\u201d stock:\nBuy 100 shares XYZ @ 108.70\nSell 1 XYZ 05\/17\/2017 105 call @ 7.45\nNet debit = 101.25 ($10,125)\nThis option is initially more than $3 in-the-money, and it has a Delta of .61. This theoretically implies that (at the moment the trade is placed) there\u2019s a 61% chance that the option will expire in the money, resulting in assignment and a profit of $375 (105 strike price \u2013 101.25 initial cost x 100 shares) before commissions. This is the maximum profit that can be earned.\nAdditionally, because the breakeven price is $101.25, the stock has to drop 7.45 points by expiration for the trade to result in a loss (before commissions). With a $101.25 breakeven price (at the moment the trade is placed), the probability is about 75% that the strategy will earn at least some profit at expiration.\nIf you define risk as the probability of profit vs. probability of loss, you might consider a 75% chance of earning at least some profit on a highly rated stock (that has to drop more than 7 points to lose money), a relatively low-risk trade. However, if you define risk as the amount you could lose vs. the amount you could earn, you might be concerned that you are risking $10,125 (max loss) to earn only $375 (max gain). While this means you could earn about 3.7% in six months, you may find the risk-to-reward ratio of about 27:1 way too high.\nLong call example\nMany traders would consider the following long call trade a relatively low-risk strategy if XYZ was a highly rated, \u201cblue-chip\u201d stock with a current price of 108.70:\nBuy 1 XYZ 05\/17\/2017 120 call @ 1.37\nNet debit = 1.37 ($137)\nIf you define risk as the amount you could lose vs. the amount you could earn, you may not think this trade is overly risky. XYZ is a highly rated stock and this option has about six months until expiration, which may be plenty of time for it to increase in price. Besides, the option doesn\u2019t have to go in the money for you to sell it at a profit; it just has to increase in price quickly enough to offset time decay. Additionally, the maximum loss on this trade is only $137. This trade theoretically has unlimited upside potential so you may consider it a relatively low-risk trade, as the risk-to-reward ratio is extremely small.\nHowever, this option is initially more than $11 out of the money and has a Delta of only .19, or a 19% probability that the option will expire in the money. This option also has a Theta of about -0.015, which implies that it will initially lose about $1.50 per day in time value, even if the stock price does not change at all. Finally, the breakeven price is $121.37 (120 strike price + 1.37 option premium), meaning that the stock has to increase by more than 12 points for this trade to result in any profit if held until expiration.\nWith a $121.37 breakeven price, the probability that the strategy will be profitable at expiration is only about 12%. In other words, while $137 may be a relatively small amount to risk, the odds are about 88% that you will lose money\u2014and about 81% that you will lose all of your money on this trade, if you hold it until expiration.\nHow do you quantify risk?\nAnother question that sometimes troubles traders is: How do you quantify risk? Is it the number of shares or the dollar amount? Traders who substitute a stock strategy with an option strategy that controls the same number of shares vs. an option strategy that risks the same amount of money, are likely taking on significantly different amounts of risk.\nConsider these hypothetical scenarios for XYZ\u2014a highly rated, blue-chip stock with a current price of 105.80:\n- Stock trade: Buy 100 shares of XYZ at $105.80 for a total cost of $10,580\n- Alternative option trade 1 (controls the same number of shares): Buy 1 XYZ 05\/17\/2017 105 calls @ 5.90 for a total cost of $590\n- Alternative option trade 2 (risks the amount of money): Buy 18 XYZ 05\/17\/2017 105 calls @ 5.90 for a total cost of $10,620\nNote that strategies involving no stock position (options only) do not entitle the trader to certain benefits often associated with stock ownership, such as dividends (if any), voting rights, and no expiration date.\nThis option used in both alternative option trades is initially almost right at the money so it has a Delta of about .50, or a 50% probability that the option will expire in the money. It also implies that initially the call options will increase (decrease) about $0.50 if XYZ increases (decreases) by $1.00.\nStock trade versus option trade 1\nIn alternative option trade 1 (which controls 100 shares of stock):\n- The option position purchased would initially be expected to increase or decrease by only about half of the dollar value of the stock.\n- However, due to its lower overall cost, this trade would move significantly more on a percentage basis, making the risk-to-reward ratio significantly lower than the purchase of 100 shares of stock.\n- Additionally, the maximum loss in alternative 1 is only about 5% of the maximum loss of the stock trade. Some traders may consider this trade less risky, even though the characteristics will change over time and the option could eventually expire worthless.\n- Further, the likelihood of sustaining maximum loss on the option trade is significantly higher than with the stock.\n- The option will sustain maximum loss if the stock is below 105 at expiration; the stock has to drop to zero to sustain maximum loss.\nStock trade versus option trade 2\nIn alternative option trade 2 (which has about the same dollar amount at risk as alternative 1):\n- Eighteen call options are purchased in lieu of the actual stock.\n- Initially a $1.00 increase (decrease) in the price of XYZ would be expected to result in about $900 profit (loss) before commissions, compared to only $100 profit (loss) for the stock trade.\n- While the initial cost of both options trades is very similar, alternative 2 would be considered far more risky by most traders because the options are initially about right at the money, with a Delta of about .50.\n- This theoretically implies a 50% probability that the options will expire in the money.\n- This also means there is about a 50% chance they could expire worthless, resulting in a 100% loss.\nWe can determine that with a $110.90 breakeven price, if you hold the options until expiration there\u2019s a 29% chance this strategy will be profitable. In other words, the odds are about 71% that you will lose money on this trade. A comparable loss on the stock trade would require XYZ to go to 0, whereas the options would expire worthless if XYZ is below 105.\nSo are long calls riskier than long stock? If you trade in units of capital (dollars), they can be. However, if you trade in units of stock (shares), long calls are less risky than a long stock position.\nTrading always involves some level of risk, but \u201crisk\u201d can be a very ambiguous term and it can be defined in many different ways. When products, strategies, markets, and account features are described as high risk, low risk, or moderate risk, make sure you understand how the risk is being defined, before you risk your own money.\nRandy Frederick can be contacted at Schwab Center for Financial Research"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"factuality","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise","category_name":"direct"},{"categorization_name":"phrasing","category_name":"long-search-query"},{"categorization_name":"linguistic_variation","category_name":"distant-from-document"},{"categorization_name":"multi-doc","category_name":"single-doc"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"expertise-categorization","category_name":"expert"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:eb97fe85-5a1f-43a8-bb01-f3df72659b0c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How many housing units does Andrew's Glen provide?","answer":"Andrew's Glen provides 40 housing units, with twenty units dedicated to formerly homeless Veterans and twenty units for formerly homeless individuals and families.","context":["Architect: SMR Architects\nLocation: Bellevue, Washington, USA\nProject Team: John Woodworth, Paul Hanson, Scott Starr, Leah Ericksen\nClient: Imagine Housing\nContractor: WG Clark Construction\nStructural and Civil Engineers: Coughlin Porter Lundeen\nPhotographs: Courtesy of SMR Architects\nAt Andrew\u2019s Glen, SMR Architects partnered with Imagine Housing to provide 40 units of transitional housing to an Eastside community deeply in need. St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal Church initiated the project, with a vision to help struggling individuals get back on their feet in a tangible way \u2014 and whose large, central site was a perfect fit. The team collaborated over the course of two years to create the right program and the right building to suit the need and the site. Today, twenty units and support services are dedicated to the needs of a formerly homeless, and largely disabled, population of Veterans, while an additional twenty units help stabilize the community in providing for formerly homeless individuals and families.\nThe site is designed to continue a campus feel for the three established uses: Church, Housing, and Thrift Store. The new apartments definethe street edge, and establish both the pedestrian and vehicular connections to all three uses. Pedestrian activity is now focused on an active community space in between the church and the apartments, central to the site, and directly connected to public transportation. This spine gathers uses \u2014 meeting spaces, laundry, and play areas, both indoors and out \u2014 while embracing the steep hillside across the site.\nThe exterior is simple and modest, respectful of the larger community in massing, color and materials. The richly mottled concrete common room walls, flanking the bright, welcoming doorway, define the entry. An open parking garage fronts the remaining two-thirds of the street and maintains the existing on site parking. A mesh screen teases as it reveals and masks the parking garage beyond, while opaque panels break the rhythm of the garage columns, and of the units above. An opportunity for delight is formed from what might have been a long, bleak wall.\nUnits include many universal design features to increase their accessibility to a variety of tenant needs. This includes a soothing and contrasting interiors color pallet to help the visually impaired; full turning circles and removable vanity cabinets in most bathrooms; and providing accessible appliances, fixtures and hardware everywhere.\nFull-height windows make for a unique experience, designed in proportion with the human body. This additional height allows light to penetrate deep into the unit, while the low sills expand and frame the territorial views. The sun connects to the floor immediately, and traces its daily path \u2014 natural light makes such a big difference in our lives through the long, dark months of the year.\nInterior common rooms look out onto covered exterior spaces, which in turn lead to areas open to the sky. In our climate it is wonderful to be able to choose the space that suits you need as the weather changes: spaces that are cozy and warm; spaces that focus and embrace the sun; spaces that let you experience the cold, crisp air, while sheltered from the rain."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"factuality","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise","category_name":"direct"},{"categorization_name":"phrasing","category_name":"concise-and-natural"},{"categorization_name":"linguistic_variation","category_name":"similar-to-document"},{"categorization_name":"multi-doc","category_name":"single-doc"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"expertise-categorization","category_name":"novice"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dea3ffa4-d4e5-4916-91f6-8e865c41ed89>"],"error":null}
