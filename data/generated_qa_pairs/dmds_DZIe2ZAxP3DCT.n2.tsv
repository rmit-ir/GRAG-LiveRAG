2	who perfected found object art concept	Marcel Duchamp perfected the concept when he made a series of ready-mades - completely unaltered everyday objects selected by him and designated as art.	['A large number of artists in the Landfillart project have incorporated found objects in their artworks to make statements about re-cycling. Some of the especially interesting examples in the Landfillart Collection can be seen in the post from May 24.\n“The use of ‘found objects’ has been incorporated into fine art since the early 1900s — long may it continue. Maybe this great project will educate the world in general about recycling, re-use and a way of seeing these ‘useless objects’ consigned to the trash bins.” Mary Bridget Cooke, Cork, Ireland\nAll That Glitters Isn’t Gold\nby Mary Bridget Cooke, from the LandfillArt Collection\nPart of a fascinating tradition in modern art…\nOriginally coming from the French term objet trouvé, found object describes art created from undisguised, but often modified, objects or products, not normally considered art.\nBefore the 20th century unusual objects were collected in cabinets of curiosities, but it was only in the early 20th century that found objects came to be appreciated as works of art in their own right. In fact Picasso was the first publicly to use the idea when he pasted a printed image of chair caning onto his painting titled Still Life with Chair Caning (1912).\nIt is generally accepted that Marcel Duchamp perfected the concept several years later when he made a series of ready-mades — completely unaltered everyday objects selected by him and designated as art.\nObjets trouvés are often used as raw material in assemblages, and Antoni Gaudí, for example, used broken pieces of pottery to cover exterior surfaces in the Park Güell buildings (1900–14) in Barcelona.\nThe Development of Collage in Cubism also saw more use of found objects\nPicasso and Braque, in particular, used real items in their paintings and constructions as a way of commenting on the relationship between reality, representation and illusion.\nJoseph Cornell’s mysterious and highly personal box constructions, which consisted largely of objets trouvés, were first presented in the context of Surrealism at MOMA in New York.\nThe use of found objects was quickly taken up by the Dada movement, being used by Man Ray and Francis Picabia who combined it with traditional art.\nArtists associated with Dada, especially Hans Arp and Kurt Schwitters, used damaged and reclaimed materials as a strong image of the futility of World War I. Schwitters, in particular, wanted to redeem the beauty and history of everyday items.\nA Popular Tradition Today\nSo using found objects, or objets trouvés in the creation of art is part of a popular tradition today and connects with the desire to recycle materials from landfills and dumps.\nThe resurgence of interest in using found objects is taking many forms — some recycling and using reclaimed rubbish, relying on expendable materials, and in assemblages. However, as an art form, there is usually some degree of modification of the found object, although not always to the extent that it cannot be recognized.\nMany modern and contemporary artists are well known for using found objects in their art. Some of the most important incloude Arman, Joseph Beuys, Traey Emin Damien Hirst, Tony Cragg, and Nam June Paik.\n“Recycling and reusing materials in artwork has been an ongoing process and philosophy for me in my work for years…Using found objects gives me, as an artist, the opportunity to challenge my viewers to think about the world around them and how our actions affect our environment…” Neal Bociek\nPropulsion Of The Nympho\nby Neal Bociek, from the LandfillArt Collection']	['<urn:uuid:f5a541e8-18b4-4c95-9fab-a851a6135820>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	novice	patient	2025-04-22T14:43:01.846439	6	24	581
