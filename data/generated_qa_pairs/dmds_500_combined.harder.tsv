65	how are modern vinyl floorcloths made	Modern vinyl floorcloths are created through a detailed process that begins with stretching cotton duck canvas on a wooden frame. The canvas is then sealed with six coats of exterior-grade latex. After light sanding, an artist hand paints and uses custom stencils to apply artwork. The piece is finished with three coats of clear acrylic and a top layer of bowling alley wax to prevent cracking, warping, and rolling.	['Walkable Art | Vinyl Floorcloths\nPhoto: Beija Flor, Available at Bailey Grey Interiors.\nWhat once was old is new again. With a rich history of adorning floors in the south, vinyl floorcloths are making a comeback. More casual, durable and easily maintained than rugs, vinyl floorcloths protect floors from grime and wear, while dressing up spaces with versatile design options that can be vintage, modern or whimsical. Floorcloths are popular today even with buyers who aren’t tethered to history. Because any pattern that you can imagine is possible, creative design freedom is truly within reach, with product designs that feel personal rather than mass-produced. Since every inch is hand-made by an artist, the addition of a floorcloth to your spaces sums to art, geometry, and history combined.\nFloorcloths are about as vintage as you can get for a good reason—they are wonderfully durable and lie flat on the floor; these classics are easy to clean and bring a burst of color and fun to any space. Non-slip vinyl floor cloths are perfect for kitchens, dining areas and laundry rooms.\nThough elemental in early American design heritage, the textile tradition of painting canvas floorcloths originated in France in the 1400s. These early pieces were small and generally used on tabletops as decoration, considered too precious to place on the floor. In the 1700s, American colonists took the idea one step further and transformed old ship sails into floorcloths. The cloths proved to be an inherently great product—they were durable and stood up to insects, heavy foot traffic and muddy boots. Floorcloths were also easy to clean and helped to control the interior climate by blocking out cold drafts in winter and staying cool underfoot in summer. Floorcloths were used in every area of Colonial homes—in entryways, under dining tables, in kitchens and bedrooms.\nOriginally, floorcloths were designed to resemble imported woven rugs and expensive marble and parquet floors. Primarily imported from England and usually with just one color, early cloths were produced using stencils; eventually, the palette grew to include chrome, blue, black, vermilion and malachite green.\nFloorcloths used a common material of the era—sturdy woven cotton—to address an equally common problem—protection and adornment of bare wood floors. The design staple had extra appeal in the sweltering South, where floorcloths often replaced heavy wool rugs in summer and were used as insulation under carpets in colder months.\nPresident Thomas Jefferson had at least two floorcloths—one in the great hall at Monticello and another in a small dining room—in his words, “to secure a very handsome floor from grease and the scouring that it necessitates.” George Washington had a cloth at Mount Vernon, and John Adams listed floorcloths in his exit inventory when he left the White House. These original, historic floorcloths are rare—literally worn to pieces; only fragments remain to be found, primarily in museums. The Golden Age of the American floorcloth spanned the late 1700s through the mid-1800s; when Sir Frederick Walton invented cheaper, mass-produced and easily available linoleum in the 1850s, it cornered the market.\nThe process of creating an old-style floorcloth in modern times is not lost; each is a work of art. Each floorcloth begins with stretching cotton duck—the tightly woven canvas used in awnings and theater sets—on a simple wooden frame. The canvas is sealed and stiffened with six coats of exterior-grade latex. Period floorcloths used linseed oil mixed with pigments and turpentine, but weren’t as durable and adept at handling high traffic and humidity as modern products.\nNevertheless, the traditional art form survives. After a light sanding, an artist hand paints and employs custom stencils to apply artwork; Greek keys, compass roses, and faux marbling are mainstays. Finally, three coats of clear acrylic and a top layer of bowling alley wax make the one-of-a-kind floor art resistant to cracking, warping, and rolling.\nWalk on the wild side\nIf you’re a do-it-yourselfer, you might want to make your own floorcloth; consider buying a remnant of vinyl flooring and painting your design on the underside. Remnants are easy to cut to size, extremely affordable and have no need of special edge treatment. It’s a fun process, but the tricky part can be coming up with an original design. A few hints: keep it simple or free-form; use two colors or multiple hues. Above all, make the process an expression of your creativity. Any good acrylic paint will work for your design, but don’t forget to protect your work of art with a couple of coats of Trewax once you’ve finished. Most purchased floorcloths come with a skid-proof backing already applied. If you are making your own, use clear silicone painted around the backside edges to keep your floorcloth from slipping.\nPhotos: Spicher and Company\nEverything old is new again\nMiriam Riggs is an area artisan who recently created three traditional floorcloths for the bedchambers at Point of Honor in Lynchburg. A veteran of her craft, Riggs has been making floorcloths for 35 years now, many of them custom designed for historic interiors. For her inspiration at Point of Honor, Riggs looked to laurel wreaths on the carved mantle detail as well as colors and styling from the custom wallpaper found in the house. Riggs explains, “In historic houses such as Point of Honor, I always seek to make the floorcloth based on historically appropriate designs and colors, while also adapting the design to the interior decoration currently in use.”\nMiriam Riggs doesn’t just create historical floorcloths. She also makes modern custom designs based on her clients’ specifications; those floorcloths can be very personal. In her words, “I see my custom designs often as an extension of the client’s imagination. I can help them visualize a concept, and turn it into a functional piece of ‘walkable art.’”\nSandusky House in Lynchburg also has a floorcloth worth a visit to see first-hand. The floorcloth now in the grand entry was designed by Jennifer Frantz of Americana Floorcloths at her studio in Ohio; it was transported from her workshop to Sandusky and installed as a wallto- wall piece.\nMoyanne Harding, owner of Estates and Consignments in downtown Lynchburg is a great fan of new floorcloth styles, preparations and products available, and is especially fond of using them in kitchens, mudrooms, and laundry rooms. In her words, they belong, “Anywhere kids, animals or husbands might bring in dirt.” She says floorcloths have come back en vogue due to their availability in a variety of sizes, patterns and colors. Further, because of their thin profile, modern vinyl pieces present no trip hazards. In her design studio, she showcases samples from a number of lines; pieces can be ordered outright or custom-made, with pricing typically from $20 to $40 per square foot. A leader in the vinyl floorcloth design space, Spicher and Company of Carlisle, Pennsylvania has a fantastic line of vintage-inspired vinyl floorcloths designed by Kolene Spicher.\nBailey Grey Interiors carries the Beija Flor line of vinyl floorcloths; Beija Flor specializes in traditional designs recreated in a contemporary medium; their floorcloths are produced from high quality, layered vinyl sheets. These beautiful pieces are strong, flexible and movable; they are made partly from recycled materials and finished with finely printed designs using a sand embossing technique. ✦']	['<urn:uuid:f8d01a0b-41a3-4e5c-a9ac-f833a65e3114>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-01T22:47:46.423955	6	69	1204
97	How did New South Wales perform in the rugby match at Perth?	New South Wales achieved a dominant 38-6 victory over Queensland in Perth. Tom Trbojevic scored a hat-trick and James Tedesco delivered a masterful performance at full-back. The Blues showcased slick ball handling and dynamic outside backs, leading 18-6 at half-time before extending their lead in the second half. The match was played in front of a record crowd of 59,721 fans at Perth Stadium.

116	Did both Kimetto and Kipchoge set their records in the same city?	No, they set their records in different cities. Dennis Kimetto set his record of 2:02:57 in Chicago, Illinois in 2014, while Eliud Kipchoge set his world record of 2:01:39 at the Berlin Marathon in 2018.	['No Products in the Cart\nIn 2014, at thirty years old, Dennis Kipruto Kimetto, (b. Jan 22, 1984) a long-distance runner from Kenya set the marathon record of 2:02:57 (two hours, two minutes and 57 seconds) in Chicago, Illinois. He was the first man to ever run under 2:03.\nHe held the record for four years. It was then broken by Eliud Kipchoge (b. Nov 5, 1984), another Kenyan long-distance runner. Kipchoge is now the world record holder in the marathon with a time of 2:01:39, which he set Sept. 16, 2018, at the 2018 Berlin Marathon.\nKipchoge also ran the marathon distance at a special event in Vienna, Austria, and achieved a time of 1:59:40. The run did not count as a new marathon record, however, because it was not an open event and the standard competition rules for pacing and fluids were not followed, but he did become the first person to ever run a marathon in less than two hours. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Kipruto_Kimetto and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliud_Kipchoge)\nWhen someone does the seemingly impossible, everyone’s interest is heightened and they, too, want to improve. For the most part, to run long distances it takes the right genetics along with having the correct limb lengths and, of course, at least 70 percent Type 1/slow twitch/slow oxidative muscle fibers, but you also must train efficiently.\nThe most efficient way to improve is to gain muscular endurance. At the end of a marathon it is the legs that give out, not the lungs. Most will incorrectly try to increase their VO2 max, but it cannot be increased by top athletes as it cannot be raised after 12 or 18 months in endurance runners. This leaves only one way and that is to raise muscular endurance by maximally training strength endurance.\nIf one simply runs a set distance at a set body weight at the same pace, then you are not increasing your work. You must become more powerful. For example, by becoming stronger you can deliver greater ground force that can reduce ground contact time. A study by Leema Paavolainen concluded that reduced ground contact time is the most important for faster running times no matter the distance.\nThe study on 5K racers who had an average stride length of two meters found they would use 2500 strides to cover a 5K. A one one-hundredth of a second reduction in ground contact time would reduce their 5K time by 25 seconds. More on this topic can be found in Underground Secrets to Faster Running by Barry Ross.\nWhy is increasing strength so important? This is a simple physics equation. First, let’s look at what is work. In physics, work is defined as the product of the net force and the displacement through which that force is exerted, or W=Fd.\nLet’s look at power. Power is defined as work done divided by the time used to do the work (P=wt). This simply says that the more powerful you are, the faster you can do the work; the work in this case being 60, 100, or 25,000 meters or even a marathon.\nIf you are just running and not strengthening your body you have most likely developed a speed barrier where you can no longer cover your distant faster. That’s the definition of the biological Law of Accommodation—that your body adapts to a constant continued stimulus by decreasing its response. So just by running you won’t eventually run faster. To break that speed barrier, you must train other activities such as special exercises for the running muscles—the calves, hamstrings, hips and glutes, and of course, some upper body work for strength and balance. Westside uses weight sleds to build running muscles.\nFor strength endurance training instead of doing the same amount of work with just body weight, the runner should use three weights on a weight sled that is connected to your body with a strap. This does not effect your running technique when using 15, 25 and 35 pounds.\nThrough experimentation Westside found that long-distance runners lack maximal strength. For instance, one long-distance runner could parallel box squat 65 pounds for 100 reps, but could only squat 100 pounds for one rep. By doing interval training with a weight sled with three different weights, strength endurance was built. Westside established 25, 35 and 45 pounds in a three-week wave will build strength endurance.\nBy doing interval training with a weight sled with three different weights to build strength endurance. But experimenting Westside has established 25, 35 and 45 pounds in a three-week wave will build strength endurance.\nFor races up to 10,000 meters one can pull a weight sled for 30 minutes or just over the world record for that length race. For the very fit, two trips can be performed. Time between trips will depend on your level of preparedness, meaning letting your heart rate get back to your normal range and then repeat. Pull the sled two times a week, but remember to cut your running back by at least 30 percent.\nA 16-ounce bottle holds 16 ounces and no more, so when you include weight sled work you have to cut your running back.

If you slow down you lose … period.\nIf you run a full marathon, start with four trips using the interval method, meaning powerwalk for 30 minutes. Let your heart rate return to normal and repeat.

215	martin gerlach photographer and sigmund freud work timeline comparison vienna	Martin Gerlach relocated his photography publishing house to Vienna in 1872, while Sigmund Freud began offering therapy to patients in Vienna in 1886, showing they both worked in Vienna during overlapping time periods in the late 19th century.	"['Festoon made from vegetables and beets, from Festons und Decorative Gruppen aus Pflanzen und Theiren, or, Festoons and decorative groups of Plants and Animals, published in Vienna in 1893 by Martin Gerlach. Images courtesy of the Museum für Kunst und Gerwerbe, Hamburg\nThese festoons with their sumptuous cascades of ripe fruits and fragrant roses suspended from a striped silk ribbon resemble at first glance sections of stone ornament, or plaster moulding. But closer inspection reveals the roses to be cabbages, the delicious looking fruits are in fact beetroots and onions, the elaborate silk bow is a curtain cord, and a wooden finial has been pressed into service as a classical-looking prop, hiding the ends of plant stems at the top of the arrangement.\nAll the festoons, swags, garlands and other embellishments in Festons und Decorative Gruppen aus Pflanzen und Theiren, or, Festoons and decorative groups of Plants and Animals, are constructed using similarly inventive combinations of flowers, vegetables, taxidermy and domestic objects. Published in Vienna in 1893 by Martin Gerlach, this book of elaborate photographic collages was intended both as reference and inspiration for artists working across a range of crafts using pattern, from wood carving, plaster work, textiles, illustration and wallpaper design.\nJudging by the seasonality of the plant materials Gerlach used, the photographs were taken over the course of many months. Early spring blossoms of apple and cherry with nesting birds give way to the lilac, roses and hollyhocks of summer, while autumn provides a profusion of gourds, sweetcorn, grapes, apples and pumpkins. Winter is represented by arrangements of pine cones and stuffed squirrels placed amongst evergreen conifer branches.\nSome of the most effective designs use only leaves – the winding stems of creeping cinquefoil form a delicate narrow border, while larger sprigs of oak leaves and acorns could be imagined as infill sections for fabric or wallpaper. Peony flowers and leaves carefully spaced over a diamond grid background would have been helpful for an artist designing a repeat pattern.\nGarlands of citrus fruits are shown in half-sections, the smaller fruits at the edges, gradually increasing in size towards the middle. Some of the most elaborate festoons include tools and musical instruments – in one example a gardener’s spade intersects with a watering can, while a straw basket (or maybe an upturned straw hat?) overflows with produce, celebrating the bounty of harvest.\nFrom the middle of the 19th century photographers such as Adolphe Braun (1812 – 1877) and Charles Aubry (1811 – 1877) saw a commercial opportunity to produce still life studies of flowers as reference material for artists. Although photographs could not entirely replace living specimens, it must have been an immense advantage to be able to see forms of flowers, their leaves and the growing patterns of stems and branches throughout the year, especially in winter, when it was not possible to observe these from life. Gerlach produced a number of reference books in this genre, including plant forms, trees, examples of wrought iron and other architectural details.\nMartin Gerlach (1846 – 1918) was born in Hanau, Germany and trained as an engraver. He established a jewellery business in the 1860s but this enterprise was unsuccessful. Having become interested in photography, Gerlach started a publishing house in the 1870s in Berlin which produced his reference books and a crafts magazine, Die Perle. He re-located his company to Vienna in 1872 and continued his work there, eventually publishing more than forty books about design and a series of books for children including songs, poems and fairytales.\nBy the end of the 19th century decorative motifs like those celebrated in Festons und Decorative Gruppen, and popular in Europe since Roman times, were soon to be swept away by new ideas and fashions associated with Modernism. Today Gerlach’s plant and vegetable festoons and garlands have almost a contemporary feel to them – it’s not hard to imagine a photographer inspired, perhaps, by carvings or plaster work in a historic house, deciding to re-create them with real materials as a post-modern photographic project.

This act, passed by Congress in 1990, provides payments to individuals who developed certain cancers and diseases due to radiation exposure from above-ground nuclear weapons tests or uranium mining. Celestial became ill after participating in post-war nuclear waste cleanup at Enewetak Atoll, and now works to document the history of nuclear testing and its health impacts in the region.

But memory is moral; what we consciously remember is what our conscience remembers. If one no longer has land but has memory of land, then one can make a map.\n--- Anne Michaels, Fugitive Pieces\n> PROTESTING CARTOGRAPHY: PLACES THE UNITED STATES HAS BOMBED\nProtesting Cartography: Places the United States has Bombed is an ongoing series of more than fifty drawings begun in 1999. They are first and foremost protest drawings,taking as their subject US military interventions utilizing the geography, politics, history, cartography, art, and the language of war as their source material. Each drawing is based on a rendering of a place, almost always viewed from the air, which has been targeted by US bombers.\nAn important common formal element in the drawings is that each one begins with ink or watercolor dropped onto the wet paper. When it dries this becomes the foundation or “blank page” upon which to tell a violent story. I chose this common ground of abstract swirling or bleeding to depict the manner in which bombs do not stay within their intended borders. Depleted uranium and other chemical agents contaminate the soil, traveling in water and currents of air for decades. Mines and unexploded bombs lay in wait for unsuspecting victims who were not even alive during the war. Bombs penetrate the planet’s surface and lay the groundwork for genocide, cancer, more war, terrorism, widows, orphans, and a vengeful populace on all sides of conflict. All this seems impossible to comprehend, much less change. However, Protesting Cartography attempts to do just that by illuminating US foreign policy, by making it visually accessible and by graphically revealing its part in the dire situation in which we find ourselves today.\nPlate 1: World Map, Protesting Cartography: Places the United States has Bombed, 2002–ongoing (Detail), with pins marking each bombed site for which there is a corresponding drawing. Photo credit: Karen Malinofski and Christopher Ciccone, North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh.\nAs an interdisciplinary artist, studio art professor, activist, and an American, I am compelled to confront difficult and complex issues in my work out of a deep sense of responsibility. I work from the privileged position of an American academic, but I am filled with guilt, shame, and horror due to my government’s policies and actions. The American media fails us day in and day out by providing propaganda and half-truths. Although I do not believe that people are tired of knowing the truth or incapable of empathy, I understand that it may be easier for most Americans to choose a state of denial. Protesting Cartography is my personal creative response, my attempt to confront and unravel this criminal knot of lies.\nArt has had a traditional role as a catalyst for change. Lewis Hine’s photographs of children toiling in factories in the early twentieth century were instrumental in bringing about child labor laws. Picasso’s infamous painting of Guernica continues to provoke international and governmental debate about war and peace, the use of violence against civilians, and the power of art itself. From German artist Kathe Kollwitz’s expressive drawings and prints done during the First World War to Hans Haacke’s Vietnam-era antiwar pieces, protest art has utilized a variety of strategies to provoke viewers into becoming actively engaged participants rather than remaining passive receptacles of (mis)information.\nSue Coe, one of the most important political artists today, prod-uces graphic and dark images of homelessness, AIDS, the American meat industry, labor, protest, war, and more wars. She creates biting illustrations for magazines such as The Progressive, Rolling Stone and Mother Jones,(1) providing incentives for turning people into vegetarians and activists. If one is already an activist or vegetarian, her work provides courage to persevere. While Sue Coe’s work has inspired me since childhood and has had perhaps the most influence on me as an artist, I use an entirely different strategy in my own work.\nSue Coe, US Military Successfully Bombs a Mental Hospital in Grenada, 1984, Oil on paper, 44 × 37.5”, Collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Courtesy of the artist.\nFor example, Coe’s painting of the US bombing of a hospital in Grenada (plate 2) is far more representational than any of my bomb drawings. Red flames leap across the high horizon line. There is a dark and tragic sense of perspective. A person on fire falls to his death into the hellish pit where civilians cower and embrace their wounded loved ones. A corpse missing a right foot lies at the base of the stairs while planes fly over another figure hanging from a gallows on the horizon. Coe never shies away from gory details, bringing to mind such artists as Goya and Kollwitz. But for Protesting Cartography I deliberately choose the different visual strategy of colorful abstraction, a form I had never before employed. I chose relative abstraction (“relative” since the drawings are literally maps and include recognizable cartographic symbols and forms, as well as some architectural and geographical details) to reach people who otherwise might turn away from the bloody realities that Coe depicts. People are apt to approach abstraction with fewer defenses. Since the drawings are intentionally beautiful, they seduce the viewer into taking a closer look at the accompanying information that explains the horror beneath the surface.\nEach drawing is distinctive in color, form, and tone. Some are purely abstract and expressive; others like the World Map, which opens this field report, with pins marking each bombed site for which there is a corresponding drawing (plate 1), and Haiti (plate 3), are recognizably and semiaccurately cartographic, whilst Shifa Pharmaceutical Plant, Sudan (plate 4), for example, depicts specific topographical details like landed planes, buildings, and roads.\nSources for these drawings include surveillance imagery, military websites such as the US Department of Defense battle plans, aerial photography, mass media, and maps. Also, to further my intention of seducing the viewer, I choose to make these drawings by hand rather than to employ photographic or other mechanical, less visceral means, in the hope that people will take their time with them and not just quickly turn the page, change the channel, or close the website.\nWhile working on this project I have communicated about its form and content with a group of scholars, playwrights, geographers, art historians, anthropologists, writers, veterans, activists, historians, and participants in or witnesses to the bombings I have depicted in the drawings. They have contributed writings that often become part of the title information.(2) The variety of perspectives – from ex-soldiers and bombardiers to survivor-activists and geographers – presents a complex story to accompany the “illustrations” of bombsites.\nMost of the people with whom I am in dialogue about this project are Americans, except for Chilean exile Ariel Dorfman, British expatriate in France John Berger, Swedish writer Sven Lindqvist, and Guam citizen Robert Celestial.\nAriel Dorfman, author of Death and the Maiden, for instance, was invited to speak at the first American teach-in days after September 11th that I organized with a few members of the Progressive Faculty Network at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. We naïvely thought that we could stop our government from bombing Afghanistan (plate 5) in retaliation. (Subsequently, I and two other organizers of the event received death threats, calls for our termination, and appeals for us to be tried for treason.) In his address, Dorfman linked the American September 11th in 2001 to the Chilean September 11th in 1973 when Chile lost its democracy in a military coup supported by the United States. John Berger, meanwhile, has compared September 11, 2001 to the bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 (plate 6). He writes, “The differences of scale and context are of course enormous. Both attacks, however, were planned as announcements.”(3)\nAnother contributor to my project, Robert Celestial, a citizen of Guam and retired US army sergeant, who was assigned to the Enewetak Atoll to participate in the postwar clean-up of nuclear waste, became sick from cleaning up the toxic residue and from living “downwind” of the tests. Celestial is spearheading the current advocacy to include Guam in the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act.4 As an activist and survivor, he tries to provide a historical account of nuclear testing – not just on the Enewetak Atoll but also on the Bikini Atoll (plate 7) and elsewhere – and the subsequent fallout and cancer clusters to anyone who will listen and who could possibly help.\nIt is no accident that Protesting Cartography comes into being at a time when US bombing campaigns are being carried out relentlessly. While we may imagine and try to believe that the wars are happening “over there,” they are always begun here at home. The first nuclear test was in Alamogordo, New Mexico. The cancer rate on Vieques Island, Puerto Rico (plate 8), is ten times that of the national average due to decades-long nuclear testing by the US government.\nWhen I exhibit these drawings there are always people who ask me if I worked for the CIA or where I found all this information, because they never knew we bombed so many places. This project is an attempt to provide: a comprehensive and more humane acknowledgement of war; a revelation and analysis of our own complicity and passive acceptance of things as they are; different and multiple ways to access, interpret, and act on the magnitude of war and its aftermath; the truth; an uncovering of covert operations; a remembrance of the dead for the living.\n1.

230	hitler otto great leadership differences similarities	Hitler and Otto the Great both achieved leadership positions in Germany/Germanic territories but through vastly different means. Otto I became King of the Lombards in 951 through military intervention in Italy and was later crowned Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire in 962 by Pope John XII, establishing legitimate rule. In contrast, Hitler gained power through political manipulation during the Great Depression, when German unemployment reached 43%. He was appointed Chancellor in 1933 and used the Reichstag fire to persuade President Hindenburg to grant him emergency powers, eventually establishing dictatorial control through the Enabling Act and dismantling all opposition to create a one-party state.	"['What were the significant events that took place as Nazism became powerful?\nThe first significant event in the rise of National Socialism (""Nazi"" was a pejorative term) was the failed Beer Hall Putsch in which Hitler and other National Socialists attempted to take over the government of Munich by coup, much as Mussolini had taken over the Italian government. Upon the failure of the Putsch, Hitler was sent to prison where he wrote his political testament, Mein Kampf. The National Socialists were aided by the Great Depression when German unemployment reached 43 per cent.\nOther political ideologies at the time were the Communists and the Social Democrats.The Communists refused to cooperate with the Social Democrats even though the two parties together outnumbered the Nazis in the Reichstag. German Communists were blinded by the hatred of socialists and by the belief that Hitler’s fascist ideas represented the last throes of capitalism and a communist revolution would soon follow. Social Democratic leaders pleaded with the Communists for a temporary alliance to stop Hitler, at one point even posing their pleas at the Soviet Embassy, but there was no use. This lack of cooperation was exacerbated by a fire which destroyed the Reichstag. The fire was blamed on a young Communist radical who was subsequently guillotined. There was substantial thinking among historians for many years that the Nazi’s had started the fire to intensify the dispute with the Communists; however recent historical evidence indicates that the young man was indeed a Communist agent intent on bringing down the government by any possible means. Ironically, his actions played into the hands of Hitler.\nHitler was an expert in dirty backroom politics. He gained the support of people in the army and big business, who thought they use him to their own advantage. Conservative and nationalistic politicians also thought that they could use him. Thus, when Hitler demanded that he be named Chancellor as a condition of joining the government, they accepted his demand. On January 30, 1933, President Hindenburg named Hitler as Chancellor. The Reichstag fire, after a particularly raucous election, played easily into Hitler’s hands. He used the fire to persuade President Hindenburg to invoke the Emergency Powers provision of the Constitution, which allowed rule by decree. Emergency acts were passed which practically abolished freedom of speech and assembly as well as most personal liberties. When the Nazi’s won only 44 per cent of the Reichstag seats Hitler outlawed the communist party and had its representatives in the Reichstag arrested. On March 23, 1933, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act which gave Hitler absolute dictatorial power for four years. Under the guise of legality, the Nazi’s slowly dismantled the opposition, and Germany was soon a one party state in which only the National Socialist Party was legal.\nThere were a number of significant events in Germany as the Nazi Party rose to power.\nThe first was the Beer Hall Putsch in Munich. This attempted rebellion did not work, but it pushed the Nazis to prominence.\nThe second was the election of 1930. In this election, the Nazis gained enough seats in the Reichstag to become the second largest party in German politics.\nThis led eventually to the third, and most importatnt, event in the Nazis\' rise to power. That event was the appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor of Germany. This happened in January of 1933.\nOf course, behind all of this was the economic and social turmoil that was rocking Germany in the years after WWI. There are no single important events in that process, but the turmoil allowed the Nazi ideology to become popular and allowed the Nazis to rise to power.', 'Two things of historical significance took place that day\nBy Joe Cannavo\nAlmost every month Italy has a public or national holiday that celebrates a religious or political event. For workers it means a paid day off. September is one of three months that does not have any such “official” holiday. However, two events occurred on Sept. 23 that have historical significance, one of which could have resulted in the breakup of a united Italy just 82 years after its unification in 1861.\nThe first one is the least known of the two and occurred on Sept. 23, 951, long before Italy’s unification in 1861. It all began in 949 when Italy fell into political chaos. One year later with the death, possibly by poisoning, of Lothair of Arles, the Italian throne was inherited by a woman, Adelaide of Italy, the respective daughter, daughter-\nin-law, and widow of the last three kings of Italy. A local noble, Berengar of Ivrea, declared himself king of Italy, abducted Adelaide, and tried to legitimize his reign by forcing Adelaide to marry his son Adalbert. However, in 951 Adelaide escaped to Canossa and requested German intervention. Otto I, traditionally known as Otto I the Great, the German king, invaded Italy. He received the homage of the Italian nobility, assumed the title “King of the Lombards” and in 952 forced Berengar and Adalbert to pay homage, allowing them to rule Italy as his vassals. Having been widowed since 946, he married Adelaide himself.\nOtto’s later years were marked by conflicts with the Papacy and struggles to stabilize his rule over Italy. Reigning from Rome, Otto sought to improve relations with the Byzantine Empire, which opposed his claim to emperorship and his realm’s further expansion to the south. To resolve this conflict, the Byzantine princess Theophanu married his son, Otto II, in April 972. Otto finally returned to Germany in August 972 and died at Memleben in 973. Otto II succeeded him as Emperor. In 962 Otto was crowned Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire by Pope John XII in Rome.\nThe other Italian historically significant event that took place on Sept. 23 could have undone the 1861 “Risorgimento” unification of Italy.\nOn that date in 1943, Benito Mussolini, deposed dictator of Italy, fashions a new fascist republic, by the leave of his new German masters, which he ruled from his headquarters in northern Italy.\nIn July 1943, after the Italian Grand Council’s vote of “no confidence,” Mussolini was thrust from power and quickly placed under house arrest. The Italian masses, who had so enthusiastically embraced him for his promises of a new Italian “empire,” now despised him for the humiliating defeat they had suffered during the war. But Mussolini still had one fan, Adolf Hitler.\nGen. Pietro Badoglio, who had assumed authority in Mussolini’s absence, knew there might be an attempt to break the former Duce out of his confinement, and so moved him to a hotel in the Apennine Mountains. Despite the presence of an entire army of armed police, German commandos in a bold move swept onto an Apennine mountain peak from the air, overran the hotel, and flew Mussolini to Hitler’s headquarters on the Russian front.\nMussolini could not sit still long and wanted to return to Italy to reassume power. But his German “patrons” had no intention of allowing him, whom they regarded as incompetent, to return to the scene of the disaster. So in order to pacify and control him, he was set up in a German-controlled area of northern Italy, Gargnano, on Lake Garda. Mussolini set about creating a reformed version of fascism, one that supposedly had learned from past mistakes and included elections and a free press. His “Verona Manifesto” was the blueprint for this new fascist republic, the Republic of Salò where his government departments had fled in light of the Italian surrender to the Allies.\nThough in theory there were to have been “free and fair” elections, there were never any elections in the new fascist republic, or for that matter, freedom of anything. Salò was little more than a police state clogged with aging Black Shirts — corrupt, viscous and delusional. And Mussolini, geographically removed from Salò, ensconced at Lake Garda as he was, controlled nothing. He was little more than a puppet of the Germans, spewing anti-Allied propaganda and avenging himself and his masters on traitors to the party by ordering the executions of former Grand Council members, including his own son-in-law, Count Ciano. Eventually, the Allied advance into northern Italy, and the brave guerilla warfare waged by the Italian partisans, spelled the end of Salò and its paper ruler, Benito Mussolini.\nWhen even Mussolini realized that all was lost, he conceded: “I am close to the end … I await the epilogue to this tragedy in which I no longer have a part to play.”']"	['<urn:uuid:7805bf01-b6d4-4718-8ee2-aa4a999a406c>', '<urn:uuid:fde16587-5f61-4216-9155-05064b8b6c82>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-01T22:36:12.692263	6	104	1423
232	how many residents michigan wind farm opt out	More than 50 residents signed documents requesting to be removed from the commercial wind overlay district, with signatures dated between April 6 and April 14. According to Jeff Smith, the county's building and zoning director, the county has never had so many opt-outs.	['BAD AXE – The county is considering lawyering up in response to a list of more than 50 residents asking to be excluded from an area being primed for a batch of 50 to 70 wind turbines.\nCounty attorney Stephen Allen this week said county commissioners should hire outside legal counsel to determine whether allowing that many residents to opt out would create spot zoning.\nSpot zoning, which many sources say is generally a bad practice, can occur when officials zone a small area or parcel for uses contrary to surrounding areas.\nThe zoning could conflict with a county’s master plan and allow for land use not afforded to the large majority of nearby parcels.\nPut simply, officials say it creates a zoning area that looks like Swiss cheese.\nSpot zoning is typically ruled invalid if challenged in court, according to the nonprofit Michigan Association of Planning. Michigan’s Zoning Enabling Act of 2006 and Planning Enabling Act of 2008 make no mention of the term.\nJohn Nugent, a county commissioner and planner, says there will be a resolution on the board of commissioners’ agenda next week to spend up to $2,500 to clarify whether Huron’s scenario would create spot zoning.\nNugent says the list of residents wanting out of the project creates an “extraordinary situation.”\nDocuments included in a packet for a board of commissioners meeting read: “We the undersigned residents of Lincoln Township hereby request to be removed from the commercial wind overlay district. Signed April 2016.”\nThe documents list more than 50 signatures with addresses, dated between April 6 and April 14. Some are from landowners already under easement with DTE, including Lincoln Trustee John Wisneski.\nJeff Smith, the county’s building and zoning director, says the county has never had so many “opt-outs.”\nSmith also asked why some who signed leases with DTE now want out of the project, without giving explanation – considering some may have already cashed checks, he said.\nAllen says he’s worked as corporate counsel for the board of commissioners since 1999, but that he doesn’t get involved in the wind energy overlay process.

242	What characteristics defined Sergeant Baker as a soldier?	SGT Baker was described as agile and physically strong despite his short height. He was characterized as quiet, respectful, punctual, hard working, and dedicated to the Army and his battery.	['By Colonel Eric Robyn, Aide to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, 1983-1985\nA Day with Sergeant John Baker,\nMedal of Honor Recipient\nAs a Field Artillery Battery Commander assigned at Herzo Base (a former Luftwaffe base near Erlangen and Nuremberg) in Germany in 1973, I was used to preparing for, and enduring, all manner of inspections and visits from higher headquarters routinely. One inspection that always added stress to my life was the old-fashioned, compliance-oriented Annual Inspector General (IG) Inspection, made especially stressful because my unit was a nuclear-armed Honest John Rocket firing battery. Every aspect of the battery would be scrutinized in detail: not only soldiers, weapons, equipment, barracks, and vehicles, but also all written training records, manuals, forms, and files had to be in perfect order.\nAbout a month prior to one of those IG inspections in 1973, a new soldier was assigned to my battery as Training NCO. His name was SGT John Baker.\nSGT Baker had been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor (MOH) in 1968 for actions in Vietnam on 5 November 1966. In fact, his company commander, CPT Robert Foley (USMA ’63), was also awarded the MOH for actions that same day. SGT Baker told me that when President Lyndon Johnson made the presentations, he looked down at SGT Baker, at 5’2” the shortest MOH recipient, and up at CPT Foley, at 6”7’ the tallest MOH recipient, and exclaimed, “You two look like Mutt & Jeff!”\nKnowing that a dreaded Inspector General (IG) Inspection was coming up, and painfully aware of how many training aids and various updated training publications we needed, I planned a trip to the USAREUR Publications and Training Aids Center in Frankfurt. I asked SGT Baker to compile a list of everything we needed, and invited him to accompany me. In those days, we wore fatigues every day, so I was surprised when SGT Baker hopped into my car the next day wearing his Army Greens with the distinctive Medal of Honor ribbon showing five white stars on a field of blue. Noticing my puzzled look, he said, “Don’t worry, Sir, you’ll see.” During our long drive to and from Frankfurt, we had plenty of time to talk and of course, he told the story of that day in November 1966. His citation for valor is well worth reading: http://homeofheroes.com/moh/citations_living/vn_a_baker.html.\nWhen we arrived at the huge supply warehouse, manned primarily by active and retired NCOs, I confidently strode up to the counter and handed my long requisition list to the NCO in charge. He took my list, and looking it over, said it would take some time to gather all the materials and to prepare for a long wait because they were very busy that day. SGT Baker, who had been standing unseen behind me, then stepped to my right and up to the counter. I watched the look of complete surprise on the face of the NCO and others standing around as they recognized the venerable blue ribbon. They immediately came to attention and asked SGT Baker how they could be of service to him. When SGT Baker said he was with me and we needed the materials on the list right away, the response was awe-inspiring: “Not a problem, Sergeant, we’ll get everything right away! What else can we do to help you?” Not that I needed to be reminded of this simple fact, but that day I pleasantly observed how the MOH trumps a captain’s bars. With SGT Baker’s quiet – but visible – assistance, we returned with more than we needed and did well on the IG inspection.\nAlthough short in height, SGT Baker was agile and physically strong. He was quiet, respectful, punctual, hard working, and dedicated to the Army and my battery. To this day, I don’t know how he ended up in my unit, but I was, and am, very thankful for him!']	['<urn:uuid:a48f65e1-f4f5-4419-b77b-c419be6fb53c>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-01T22:36:12.692263	8	30	650
329	I'm fascinated by local food traditions and heard about a big bean festival somewhere in Piedmont - could you explain what this event is all about?	The Carnevale di Santhià features Italy's largest fagiolata (bean festival), where around 20,000 portions of beans are distributed. This event begins with a unique wake-up call at 5 AM, when the Corpo Pifferi e Tamburi, one of Italy's oldest and most important bands, starts playing to wake up the townspeople, especially the Piazza commanders who run the bean festival.	"['The Carnival in the Province of Vercelli\nThis Carnival celebration is one of the most renowned in the Vercelli province and throughout Piedmont. The most typical characteristic of the Carnevale di Borgosesia - the Mercû Scûrot - first occurred in 1854 when a group of merrymakers did not want the fun to stop. On that day, elegant men held a sort of ""funeral” for Carnival on Ash Wednesday, and accompanied a casket containing a straw puppet representing Carnival through the streets of the Borgo.\nThe next year, the puppet was named ""Peru Magunella”: the first name derived from a dialectal pronunciation of the patron saint’s name (Saint Peter) and the second name came from ""Magoni”, the nickname used to identify people from Borgosesia. Only 30 years later, a person began to interpret the puppet and they also found the puppet a wife, called""Gin Fiammàa”. The Mercû Scûrot, considered to be a unique event in Europe, is held on Ash Wednesday, the day on which the Borgosesia Carnival finishes traditionally, unlike the other celebrations in surrounding towns, which end on Shrove Tuesday. According to tradition, in 1854 at the end of the Carnival celebrations, a group of German and Alsatian businessmen employed at a wool factory founded a few years prior - the first nucleus of what would evolve into Manifattura Lane Borgosesia - were unhappy that the celebrations were over, and decided to have a funeral for the festivity on the morning of Ash Wednesday. Dressed elegantly, they paraded a fake casket through the town in an improvised funeral procession and stopped for a drink in the osterie.\nThis tradition still continues today. Participants dress up in top hats and capes and carry wooden ladles that they use to drink wine that is distributed in specific locations along the procession route. They start their walk after lunch, and end the procession with a reading of the last will and testament of Peru Magunella. Then, they burn the puppet for good luck.\nCarnevale di Crescentino\nThe masks of the historical celebration Carnevale Storico Crescentinese, which has taken place since 1929, are ""Regina Papetta” and ""Conte Tizzoni”, who are crowned according to a particular rite on the day before the parade of allegorical floats. This Carnival tradition is linked to an actual event that happened in 1529, when a group of young Crescentino citizens, allied with the city of Vische, rebelled against and killed their despot ruler, Count Riccardo IV Tizzoni.\nThe legend starts with historical facts: in the year 1529, Count Riccardo IV Tizzoni added to the oppression that he already subjected the people to by imposing the ""ius primae noctis” law, or rather his right to sleep with brides on their wedding nights. During the night between 14 and 15 February 1529, as the town appeared to be quietly awaiting the last days of Carnival, the daughter of the miller from the Mulino Stella cut off the tyrant’s head as the people began a revolt signalled by the bell in the Torre Civica. According to tradition, the name ""Papetta” derives from the maize (corn) used to make cornmeal for polenta, since the girl was the miller’s daughter. The festival ends with a masked parade featuring allegorical floats, musical bands, folkloric groups, majorettes and flag throwers.\nCarnevale di Santhià\nThe Carnevale di Santhià is the oldest Carnival celebration in Piedmont. It was created by Abbadia, a lay association that used to organise dances and Carnival celebrations. The Abbadia is mentioned for the first time in a document dated 1338, but in the 15th century it was replaced by the Antica Società Fagiolesca, the predecessor of the current Comitato Carnevale.\nEvery year on 6 January, they open the celebrations: the main characters and rites connected with the event have maintained their significance over time. These are the characteristics of the Carnevale di Santhià, and they transform the festival into an essential event for that time of year.\nThe masks are Majutin dal Pampardù and Stevulin ‘dla Plisera, and they rule the city during the three-day celebration. According to legend, Stevulin and Majutin were two peasants, a farmer and his wife, who came to the city for their honeymoon. The local governor, with the townspeople’s consent, gave the keys to the city to the newly-weds and allowed them to administer justice and govern the city for three days. This fact is the origin of the modern ""key ceremony”, after which Stevulin reads a speech to the population in the local dialect, which contains humoristic commentary about current events.\nDuring the presentation ceremony of Stevu and Majot, the new couple receives the typical objects that make up their costumes: the ""caplin”, the ""cavagna”, the ""umbrela” for him and the ""spunciun, scusal and mantlin-a” for her, while the two actors from the previous year are inducted into the group of ""Stevu e Majot Früst”.\nSome of the most memorable moments and rites of this Carnival tradition include: the ancient rite of the Salamanda, in which a group of people dressed up like pigs form a procession in the city streets and distribute porchetta sandwiches; Italy’s largest fagiolata (bean festival) which involves distributing around 20,000 portions; the wake-up call at 5 am before the fagiolata, during which the Corpo Pifferi e Tamburi (one of the oldest and most important bands in Italy) starts playing at 5 o’clock to wake the townspeople up, especially the Piazza commanders who run the bean festival.\nThe final ceremony is the Rogo del Babciu, during which the papier-mâché puppet representing the essence of Carnival is burned and the statue of Ganduja is taken down from its throne.\nCarnevale di Varallo\nThe Carnevale di Varallo, one of the city’s oldest traditions, is called the ""day of the old Pasquetta” locally. It ends on the first day of Lent with the Processo al Marcantonio (Trial of Marcantonio, the main mask of the celebration).\nThe origins of this celebration date back to 1595, when a group of friars from the Sacro Monte di Varallo were discovered as they celebrated Carnival. Today, the masked group impersonating the spirit of Carnival consists of twelve people with two main characters, King Marcantonio and his wife, Cecca.\nIn the past ""Pasquetta” symbolised Epiphany, and was celebrated with a large bonfire to welcome the new year. It was a festival to bury the past and invoke prosperity for the New Year and the start of Carnival. Over time, the popular tradition turned ""Pasquetta” into the mother of Marcantonio and Carnival in general. This character is a perpetually fertile woman who, each year, is entrusted with birthing a new Carnival and a new child called Marcantonio, the King of the Dughi and Falchetti. The parade held each year on Epiphany features masks representing the ""vecchio Bacucco”, Pasquetta’s husband, and the ""Balia” (the wet nurse). Vecchio Bacucco is only Marcantonio’s nominal father, and this is the subject of the trial and bonfire for Pasquetta on the Mastallone.\nAnother unmissable event featured in the Varallo Carnival celebration is the ""Gran Bal dla Cecca” dance held at the Teatro Civico. ""Cecca” is the wife of Marcantonio, and the Queen of Carnival. Since 1950, tradition commands that Cecca is elected the night before the patron saint celebration, during the Gran Veglione di San Gaudenzio, and now she is chosen from one of the girls from Varallo, but her identity is kept secret until the night of the ""Ballo della Cecca” dance. On Sunday, Marcantonio receives the keys to the city, and then later a parade with the Carnival masks lightens the atmosphere in the streets of Varallo.\nVisitors should not miss the events on Shrove Monday, the ""Giurnàa ‘dla leugna” and the ""Bal ‘dla Lüm”. For this tradition, on this day, Varallesi from the Crevola frazione cross the bridge over the Sesia River to get wood from the inhabitants to cook the paniccia on the following day. The origin of this tradition is unclear, but the official reason is that in the past there was a sentence that had given the Varallesi a sort of feudal right over the community of Crevola. Now, this practice has become a custom. The day ends with a traditional dance called ""Lum”, after the old stable lights that provided light during vigils of Valsesian mountain people. Now, it is a symbol of the Carnevale di Varallo. The dance dates back to 1876 when the Osteria del Lupo in Varallo Vecchio organised a dance for Carnival with rustic decorations, including iron ""Lum” lamps to embellish the dining hall. Prizes are given during the evening for the best costume and the best masked group.\nTuesday celebrates traditional Paniccia, a nutritious soup with rice and vegetables prepared in enormous pots, which at one time was the only guarantee of a hot meal for the poor and needy. Tradition commands that the fires be lit at 6 AM in Piazza San Carlo.\nThese Carnival celebrations conclude with the Processo al Marcantonio (Trial of Marcantonio), and the bonfire on the evening of Ash Wednesday, with a performance that makes fun of the most important news of the city.\nCarnevale di Vercelli\nThe Carnevale di Vercelli has become an important celebration, well-known even outside the region. It starts with the presentation of the main masks of Vercelli, ""Bicciolano” and his consort ""Bela Majin”, and amid evening celebrations, bean festivals in the city rioni, and children’s dances, the most important moment of Carnival finally arrives: the parade with floats and groups of people in costume.\nThe story of the Bicciolano mask dates back to the end of the 1700s, when the French Revolution was coming to Piedmont. Vercelli was governed by a rich untouchable ruling class that imposed taxes and duties for personal reasons. In defence of the people, Carlin Belletti (nicknamed ""il Bicciolano”) a legendary figure at the time, started a protest. Imprisoned by the powerful rulers in the castle of Ivrea, Belletti was freed and then returned to Vercelli in triumph. His name went down in history linked with the ideals of justice and equality.\nThe most important events of Carnival - after the proclamation of the ""Bela Majin” - are the arrival of Bicciolano and his consort, with the symbolic Key Ceremony and the parade of allegorical floats. These unique moments contain the true spirit of Carnival and, for this reason, feature the participation of several Carnival committees from all over the province. This popular event records an increase in the number of visitors every year, because people want to enjoy this happy, carefree time of year in which everything is possible.\nBicciolano has been included in the list of official masks of the Associazione Centro Coordinamento Maschere Italiane.']"	['<urn:uuid:55b2af4a-eecc-4b4c-8f80-e989a9f7de72>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-01T23:21:14.341336	26	59	1777
347	who were first people interviewed monthly newsletter eso 2019	The 2019 interview series began with Alastair Webb from the University of Oxford, UK, followed by Anita Arsovska from the University Ss Cyril and Methodius, Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia.	['Each month, the PR Committee interviews an ESO Fellow (FESO) to feature in the newsletter.\nTo qualify as an FESO, members must demonstrate scientific quality and a willingness to actively volunteer in ESO. There are no age requirements, but FESO must meet minimum standards. FESO receive additional benefits, including participation in the Council of Fellows. Visit our website for more information on how to distinguish yourself as a FESO.\nWe hope you will enjoy getting to know the Fellows who participate in the 2019 interview series and thank them in advance for taking the time to share with our readers. The series began with Alastair Webb, University of Oxford, UK, next we interviewed Anita Arsovska, University Ss Cyril and Methodius, Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia.\nThis month, we present Francesco Corea, Stroke and Neurology Units, Ospedale San Giovanni Battista Foligno, Italy. He is an active FESO, Chair of the ESO Social Media Committee and a member of the Telestroke Committee.\nWhat are your main fields of interest in stroke medicine and research?\nMy interest on Stroke started in the late 90s during Medical School. Initially, the main work was in the acute phase. I had the privilege to be involved in pivotal RCTs from Ancrod to Alteplase. This brought me from initial deep frustration to the final exciting success. Later once Stroke Units became the standard of care I found new challenges in the rehab field. I was always interested in innovative technologies from diagnostics to therapy. Internet and telemedicine where promising tools for Stroke doctors in the 2000s. Many were still skeptical that either could become a high-profile medical subject. Now working with e-health is more and more a reality.\nWhat is the role of ESO in facilitating and promoting the projects you are coordinating or where you are involved?\nThe working market in Europe changed dramatically in the last decade.The shortage of physicians with specific profiles lead to the emergence of a new generation of dynamic Stroke doctors. The chance of being involved in ESO was thereby crucial in my career.\nThe place for Stroke professionals to share practice standards and update their competence is ESO (Summer/Winter Schools, main ESOC). In ESO, I found the right contacts to develop an efficient regional Telestroke network. This would have been impossible otherwise. The ESO international panel of experts on Telestroke succeeded to produce a unique recommendation paper on the topic (1). This lead to encourage the standardization in the field at continental and national levels.\nRecently ESO members joined their efforts in the Social Media committee. What role do social media play in Stroke medicine? We have tried to understand the drivers of interest on the web with an Infodemiology analysis. What are the effects of global Stroke campaigns on internet public ? (look for our presentation in Milan ESOC19). Where else it would be possible other than in ESO ?\n(1) Hubert, Gordian J, Gustavo Santo, Geert Vanhooren, Bojana Zvan, Silvia Tur Campos, Andrey Alasheev, Sònia Abilleira, and Francesco Corea. “Recommendations on Telestroke in Europe.” European Stroke Journal, (October 2018). doi:10.1177/2396987318806718.\nWhat do you expect from ESO in the future to support research?\nThe best strategy to find resources for stroke is to invest in a renewed care pact. To gain the attention not only of traditional mass media but also of the web public. The access to stroke care and research funding is not homogeneous in large areas of Europe. Further efforts must be made for a renewed alliance between health care professionals and citizens. This will empower the community that supports the fight against stroke in Europe.\nWhat do you think a mentor should do to support the projects and the career of a mentee and, conversely, what should a mentee expect from a mentor?\nLong time ago I participated in a consensus (2) suggesting a model for harmonizing Stroke training in Europe. The topic of mentoring and environment was central. Seen the wide curricula needed for Stroke experts (e.g.: from diagnostics, to acute phase and rehabilitation) the team-work model was the main solution guaranteeing results. We wrote: “Whatever the main background the most important aim is to ensure that the stroke trainee is competent in practicing Stroke medicine and that he or she can function effectively as a Stroke specialist leading a hospital stroke team”. As a mentee generally I expected to receive solid knowledge, as a mentor I encourage to build organizational skills to develop an effective leader.\n(2) Corea F, Gunther A, Kwan J, Petzold A, Debette S et Al.

Phil and Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge. I am a committee member for the Association for Environmental Archaeology and in my spare time I enjoy cycling, walking and reading.\nI am currently involved in a number of research projects involving the Neolithic of southwest Asia.\nI have recently been awarded an AHRC, Early Career grant in collaboration with Dr Carol Palmer (CBRL), Prof John Grattan (University of Aberystwyth) and Dr Helen Smith (Bournemouth University). The aim of this project is to develop a combined phytolith and geochemical method to help us understand how space was used in early Neolithic sites through the ethnographic analysis of Bedouin camp sites and traditionally built villages in Jordan (http://research.bournemouth.ac.uk/2014/07/inea-project-2/).\nI work on the WF16 project (a PPNA site in southern Jordan), the Eastern Fertile Crescent Prehistory Project (EFEC) which explores the transition from foraging to farming in the Kurdistan Region of northern Iraq, the Boncuklu Project and the Çatalhöyük Project.\n- Cucchi, T., Jenkins, E. et al., 2020.

405	I've heard about the Progressive Automotive X Prize competition - what was the winning innovation and has it made it to the market?	The $5 million grand prize went to a startup called Edison2 for their Very Light Car, which weighs just 830 pounds and achieves 100.3 miles per gallon. Despite setting records for aerodynamic efficiency at a General Motors wind tunnel and achieving an EPA-accredited 350 miles per gallon-equivalent rating in an electric version, the car hasn't made it to market yet. Although Edison2's team has had numerous discussions with U.S. and foreign automakers, no manufacturer has licensed their design or invested in the company. The auto industry and car buyers appear hesitant to embrace such radical change, despite the vehicle's breakthrough efficiency.	['The Best Ideas Money Can Buy\nThe prize pool for environmental innovation challenges increased twelvefold in the past ten years—and shows no sign of easing up. But does crowd-sourcing solutions pay off for the world as well as for the winners?\nBy Marc Gunther\nThe ceremony had all the pomp of the Oscars, minus the gowns. Musical fanfares greeted each presenter. Politicians delivered windy speeches. A global audience watched live (and a prime-time special followed on The Discovery Channel) as the winners of the Progressive Automotive X Prize were announced on September 16, 2010, in Washington, D.C.\nThe $5 million grand prize went to a startup company called Edison2, whose founder, Oliver Kuttner, had assembled a team of professional motor-racing engineers to rethink the fundamentals of the automobile. Their winning entry, aptly named The Very Light Car, weighs just 830 pounds, travels 100.3 miles on a gallon of gas, and represents a radical departure from any other car on the road today. “That’s what this competition is all about: advancing the science behind automotive technology to create revolutionary change,” declared Glenn Renwick, chief executive of Progressive Insurance, which put up $10 million in total prize money. Peter Diamandis, founder and chief executive of the X Prize Foundation, was characteristically effusive. “We’re living in a day and time where literally anything is possible,” he declared, “where a man or woman who is passionate and driven can go out and build a spaceship or a 100-mile-per-gallon car. This is only the beginning.”\nBut the beginning of what? Don’t expect to see the Edison2 on the roads anytime soon, if ever; so far, no auto-maker has stepped forward to license the design. When it comes to prizes, though, we’re well past the beginning. Thanks in part to the influence of Diamandis and the X Prize, nonprofits, governments, and corporations are turning to prizes to spur innovation—particularly environmental innovation.\nIt’s not hard to see why. Unlike conventional research and development, prizes pay for performance, not just the effort. They call attention to important issues. And they open up problems to anyone with a good idea (or a bad one), getting beyond insiders or accredited professionals. “There are so many more ideas and possible solutions out there in the world than any given company or organization can tap into,” says Beth Trask, who oversees prizes for the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund. Some people call this Joy’s Law—after Bill Joy, a founder of Sun Microsystems and a venture capitalist who once said: “No matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else.”\nOften, though, it takes insiders as well as outsiders to solve big problems, as Edison2’s travails suggest. Prizes can clearly drive technological innovation, but big environmental problems such as climate change and biodiversity loss are shaped by politics, economics, and culture as well as by science and engineering. And that raises a question: Once the buzz dies down, can prizes generate solutions that scale up to deliver lasting environmental change? Put another way, do they pay off for the world as well as for the winners?\nHistory tells us that prizes can deliver big social benefits. Before the growth of research universities and global corporations with R&D labs, prizes were the pathway to solving many scientific problems, according to Karim Lakhani, a faculty member at Harvard Business School who studies open innovation. The Longitude Prize, established in 1714 by the British government, inspired clockmaker John Harrison to develop the marine chronometer, enabling ships to know their locations at sea. In 1795, Napoleon offered a 12,000-franc prize for a method of food preservation to feed his army when “an invaded country was not able or inclined to sell or provide food,” according to Knowledge Ecology International. The 1809 winner, French confectioner Nicolas Appert, invented the basic method of canning food still in use today. Nearly a century later, America’s biggest manufacturer of billiard balls, Phelan & Collander, offered $10,000 in gold to anyone who could come up with a substitute for the elephant ivory used in billiard balls. That may have been the first prize designed to promote environmental protection—although the solution turned out to be celluloid, one of the first industrial plastics.\nMost famously, Charles Lindbergh flew the Spirit of St. Louis from New York to Paris in 1927 to win a $25,000 prize offered by New York hotelier Raymond Orteig. It was Lindbergh’s story that inspired Peter Diamandis, who has had a lifelong fascination with space travel, to announce the first X Prize in St. Louis in 1996. Eight years later, aerospace designer Burt Rutan, financed by Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen, won what had become the $10 million Ansari X Prize for developing a private spacecraft—after 26 teams from seven nations spent more than $100 million on the competition. Since then, another $1.5 billion in private and public funds has been invested to build a private spaceflight industry. Says Diamandis: “We’re on the verge of the greatest exploration that the human race has ever known.”\nA 50-year-old philanthropist and entrepreneur who earned an MD degree from Harvard but never practiced medicine, Diamandis has become the world’s leading evangelist for the power of prizes. The success of the space-travel prize led him to organize prizes in environment, genomics, and health care; his team is currently working on prizes in education and global development, too—on the theory that no problem is too big to be solved by the collective intelligence of mankind. “Out there in the world today, there are billions of innovative people,” Diamandis says. “How do you get them to spend their time working on your problem? When you’re looking for a needle in a haystack, an X Prize allows the needle to come to you.”\nThe X Prize phenomenon has set off a boom in the prize business. A 2009 McKinsey and Company report identified 219 prizes worth at least $100,000, more than 60 of which had debuted since 2000. (1) Total prize money: $315 million. (Some prizes reward past achievement, but most are competitions focused on a future goal, the report says.) Last year, the Obama administration created challenge.gov, a portal that lists government prizes ranging from a NASA green-flight challenge to build a super-efficient aircraft, to an EPA essay contest inviting contestants to write Six Words for the Planet. McKinsey said 80 major prizes are devoted to energy and the environment.\nSome have already delivered results. When Congress enacted legislation in 2007 to create a $10 million prize for an efficient light bulb to be manufactured in the U.S., Philips, the world’s largest lighting company, accelerated its work on LED technology. Last year, a Philips 60 watt–equivalent LED bulb was awarded the L Prize. The new bulb went on sale on Earth Day 2012. “Would it have happened anyway?” asks Ed Crawford, president of Philips North America. “Absolutely. But we’re at least two years ahead of where we would have been.” The Philips LED bulb, which had to meet rigorous Department of Energy standards to win, is 83 percent more efficient than a traditional incandescent bulb and lasts 20 to 30 years, depending on usage. It should save customers money, despite a steep $50 price tag. “It really is a breakthrough product,” Crawford says.\nLast fall, with the support of environmental philanthropist Wendy Schmidt, the X Prize Foundation awarded $1.4 million in prizes to improve the ways oil is cleaned up after spills. Elastec Marine, a private company, won the $1 million first prize in the competition by developing technology that sucked up oil at a rate of 4,670 gallons per minute—more than three times the industry norm. In the meantime, the World Wildlife Fund has been running its International Smart Gear competition since 2004, awarding prizes for fishing gear that reduces the capture of unwanted marine life—commonly known as bycatch. Several winning entries have been commercialized, and a couple of inventions have become mandatory in selected fisheries.\nNone of those competitions cast a wide net (if you’ll pardon the pun) in the search for solutions. It was almost a given that a lighting company would win the L Prize, and no landlubber is going to invent “greener” fishing gear. But other prizes are now using the power of the Internet to crowd-source solutions. InnoCentive, a company spun off from pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, acts as a clearinghouse for companies and nonprofits, including Environmental Defense Fund, to tap into its community of more than 250,000 problem solvers from all over the world who compete for cash prizes. “Challenge-driven innovation,” it’s called, and it seems to work. When Harvard’s Lakhani studied InnoCentive, he found that its diverse community of Internet-connected scientists and engineers found solutions to about “one-third of a sample of problems that large and well-known R&D-intensive firms had been unsuccessful in solving internally.” So-called outsiders, he found, did best because they looked at problems with fresh eyes.\nLast year, for example, in a challenge put forth by Environmental Defense Fund, Patrick Fuller, a graduate student in chemical and biological engineering at Northwestern University, won $5,000 for an idea about capturing agricultural runoff and using the nitrate-rich water to feed algae. Iowa soybean and corn farmers will now try it out. Environmental Defense Fund is also using the InnoCentive platform to address two problems associated with electronics recycling. Together with the Consumer Electronics Association, they sponsored a competition to find creative ways to repurpose old cathode-ray picture tubes. And with EMC Technologies, a major Massachusetts-based firm, they are offering a prize for technologies that keep track of discarded electronics to ensure they are handled responsibly. “Within those big, gnarly, system-wide problems,” EDF’s Beth Trask says, “we can carve out discrete questions that need to be solved, often of a technical or scientific nature.” Focus is the key to managing challenge-driven innovation, explains Dwight Spradlin, CEO of InnoCentive. “If I had 60 minutes to save the world,” he says, “I’d spend 55 minutes asking the right question.”\nFor General Electric, which invited entrepreneurs to propose new business ideas and technologies through a competition called the Ecomagination Challenge, the key to making profitable use of the ideas is what happens after prizes are awarded. Initially, GE and four venture-capital firms put up $200 million to find and fund promising technologies for the smart grid and to promote energy efficiency; they attracted more than 1,500 business plans and invested $85 million in startups.\nThen, according to Mark Vachon, vice president of GE Ecomagination, GE set out to test the new technologies with customers and, if needed, bring its own know-how to bear. “We have an amazing infrastructure,” he says. “Five global research centers, 1,500 PhDs, as well as access to thousands of customers.” So, for example, GE invested in a company called Oblong Industries, which surfaced during the Ecomagination Challenge and makes “gesture-based operating systems” such as those seen in the movie Minority Report. GE also licensed Oblong’s technology for its Smart Grid software, which it is testing with utility companies. “The prize can get ideas into a funnel, but it can’t get them to scale,” says Vachon. Only big companies, governments or consumers can do that.\nGetting new technologies to scale, as Vachon notes, takes more than a contest. That’s the challenge facing the X Prize Foundation, which has proven that it can uncover and showcase breakthrough innovation, such as private space travel or The Very Light Car. But Diamandis and his team have no desire to run the equivalent of a high-school science fair for well-to-do entrepreneurs; they want to change the world. Diamandis likes big, attention-getting ideas not for their own sake, but because he wants X Prizes to have an impact on “hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people,” he told me. The trouble is, well-entrenched industries such as the auto industry may resist breakthrough ideas because they’re tied to old ways of doing things. The automakers, after all, know how to build small, fuel-efficient cars; they haven’t done so to this point except when forced to by the government, because they don’t think consumers will buy them.\nEdison2 and its Very Light Car have yet to overcome those institutional obstacles. Eighteen months after winning the X Prize, Edison2’s engineers are still hard at work, trying to design a car that will be efficient and affordable, with all the comfort and safety buyers have come to expect. The Very Light Car set a record for aerodynamic efficiency at a General Motors wind tunnel, and an all-electric version achieved an EPA-accredited 350 miles per gallon–equivalent rating. But, although Oliver Kuttner and his crew have had numerous conversations with U.S. and foreign automakers, none has yet stepped up to license their car design for manufacturing. Nor has any manufacturer invested in Edison2. It’s not clear that the auto industry—or car buyers—is prepared to embrace the kind of radical change embodied by The Very Light Car and encouraged by the X Prize.\nA new environmental X Prize under development could run into similar obstacles. A $10 million prize for carbon capture and recycling aims to do nothing less than transform the energy and climate landscape by turning carbon dioxide emissions from a waste stream into an asset. It’s being designed to uncover ways that carbon can be beneficially and efficiently re-used—as a feedstock for fuels, plastics, chemicals, fertilizers, building products, or other valuable materials. If all goes according to plan, the prize would solve a problem that has stumped the federal government: although Congress has appropriated $6 billion to develop ways to capture CO2 and store it underground, its efforts have stalled because there’s no way to pay for carbon capture and sequestration. Recycling carbon, by contrast, would generate revenues—at least in theory.\nTri-State Generation and Transmission, a wholesale electric-power supplier owned by 44 electric cooperatives in the West, has agreed to put up $10 million for the carbon prize. The company generates most of its electricity by burning coal and natural gas. “We’ve been looking at what do we do with carbon,” says Jim Spiers, a senior vice president at Tri-State. “We’re looking for a totally different capture solution that will create a monetizable by-product.” The X Prize Foundation is now trying to raise the money needed to run the competition. Success in carbon capture and recycling will require shaking up the heavily regulated, slow-moving utility industry, which will be no easy feat.\nLong odds don’t deter Diamandis. He is an inveterate optimist. (His new book Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think is not for the cynical among us.) Along with its environmental work, the foundation is developing challenges in agriculture, education, and health care in the global South, aiming at discovering scalable ways to “create wealth and uplift entire populations from poverty.”\nIsn’t that a lot to ask of a prize? I ask Diamandis. Maybe, he replies, but we don’t know yet what prizes can or cannot do. “Can they change rules and regulations? Can they change a marketplace? Can they change human behavior? We’re going to experiment. We’re going to find out.” ❧\n1.

481	What unique symbol marks the pilgrimage trails in Norway?	The Pilgrims' Way is marked by a square emblem the size of a cocktail napkin showing a red-on-black or red-on-gray Celtic-like cross (the St. Olav's Cross) bisected by a cloverleaf.	"[""Hiking the pilgrimage trails of Norway and Scandinavia: Ancient footsteps with a modern twist.\nThe pilgrimage trails collectively known as St. Olav's Ways cross Scandinavia on their way to Trondheim. While not as famous as some pilgrimage routes, they still attract people from all over the world.\nIn a land where hiking is second only to skiing as a national pastime, many Norwegians are unaware that the longest and oldest of Norway's recognized walking trails crosses not only mountains, streams and forests but also Oslo, barley fields, the E6, and in some cases people's backyards.\nFrom Oslo to Nidaros\nPilegrimsleden, or The Pilgrim's Way, stretches 643 km from the ruins of Mariakirken in Oslo's Gamlebyen to Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim.\nIn addition, several historical feeder trails connect with the main route, including a segment from Tønsberg northward to Oslo, and a route from Selånger on the Bothnian Sea in Sweden westward to Trondheim via Stiklestad (known also as St. Olavsleden).\nAn experience like no other\nThe Pilgrim Way offers a hiking experience like no other because of its sheer variety and historical back-story. It is a walk through culture and time as well as nature, embracing the human-built environment as much as wilderness and highlands.\nIt all came about because a Norwegian king, Olav Haraldsson, got himself martyred at the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030, and canonised not long thereafter.\nMiracles attributed to St. Olav drew penitents and pilgrims from all parts of Europe to Nidaros, where the slain king was buried after some grave-shifting.\nThe Cathedral was later erected on the spot. At its medieval heyday, the journey to Nidaros became the northern apex of a pilgrimage matrix extending south to Rome, east to Jerusalem, and west to Santiago de Compostela.\nThis carried on until the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century. After Norway became predominantly Lutheran, the Pilgrims' Way fell largely into disuse and was all but forgotten for the next 450 years.\nIn the 1990s, some prominent proponents of friluftsliv and Norway's Deep Ecology movement, along with church leaders, persuaded the government to join in an effort to rediscover and reestablish the old pilgrim routes.\nAfter five centuries of human activity and imprint this meant that where once stood only woods, footpaths and the occasional river, now there were motorways, homes, and golf courses directly on the places history said St. Olav's devotees trod.\nBecause the project planners of the resurrected pilgrimage routes wished to hew to the original walks as much as possible, the modern-day pilgrim/hiker traverses everything from city streets and freeway underpasses to steep forests and the Dovrefjell plateau.\nThe real Norway\nAlong the way you can expect to see iconic Norwegian stave churches, farms, towns, cities, lakes, rivers, mountains, valleys, ruins, historical monuments, the settings of Peer Gynt and Kristin Lavransdatter, wildlife, and many, many sheep.\nMost importantly for navigation purposes, you will have your eyes peeled for a square emblem the size of a cocktail napkin: a red-on-black or red-on-gray Celtic-like cross (the St. Olav's Cross) bisected by a cloverleaf, the symbol that marks the Pilgrims' Way.\nThis little homing beacon appears in numerous forms, from sturdy fence-post plates to dangling sticks from tree branches to stickers on traffic poles.\nIf you look closely on a stroll around Trondheim or Oslo, you will likely come across it in the vicinity of the oldest churches, and various other seemingly random places.\nRecently I found Pilgrims' Way markers while wandering around Oslo's Ekeberg sculpture park!\nAccommodation on the route\nWhereas DNT huts provide shelter to hikers on most trail networks in Norway, travelers on the paths that make up the Pilgrims' Way can bed down for the night in a stabbur, farmhouse, youth hostel, tourist hotel, church hall, community center, or school, among other pilgrim-designated lodging options.\nThe option to camp\nCamping-oriented hikers and those wanting to save on expenses can, of course, put up a tent in campgrounds or just about anywhere that isn't close to someone's house or in a cultivated field.\nWhen I walked the Pilgrim Way from Oslo to Trondheim with a friend, we did a mix of camping with our own gear and paying to stay at indoor places.\nRead more: Camping in Norway\nI would highly recommend staying in at least some of the pilgrim-oriented lodging along the way for an opportunity to talk with the hosts and learn more about the areas you are walking through.\nThree truly memorable examples of this are the Sygard Grytting farm in Sør-Fron, welcoming pilgrims since the 13th century; Hæverstølen Gardstun in Rennebu, run by one of the founders of the revived Pilgrims' Way; and Munkeby Hostel on the way from Stiklestad to Trondheim, close to a monastery which produces what many regard as Norway's finest cheese.\nCustom-build your ideal hike\nHiking the entirety of the main Oslo-Trondheim route or the trans-Sweden Selånger-Trondheim route will take upwards of a month, but a great feature of the Pilgrim Way is that it lends itself to customization depending on one's interests and available time.\nBecause the pilgrim paths go right through several population centers, you can pick your own start and end points with easy access by train or bus.\nAn ever-increasing number of guided group tours for segments ranging from one day to five weeks is also available.\nWhether you are spiritually-minded or just enjoy walking, every day and every part of the Pilgrim Way presents different joys and challenges – just as it must have done for the first travelers nearly a thousand years ago.""]"	['<urn:uuid:65de2a4d-90e9-45ae-8414-949a79f65b9b>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-01T23:55:16.606337	9	30	924
482	mazda rx7 first version power specs	The first Mazda RX-7 used a 12A rotary engine displacing 1.2 liters and producing around 105 horsepower. It could accelerate from zero to sixty in ten seconds.	"[""Image credits: © Mazda.\n1982 Mazda RX-7 news, pictures, specifications, and information\nIn 1969 Mazda Project engineer Akio Uchiyama began work on a two-seater sports car. Internally it was called project X020A and eventually became known as RS-X. The idea was to share a chassis from a production saloon thus saving on production costs and limiting the time-to-market. This project continued until 1973 when the oil crisis finally put an end to the car.\nAround 1975 Sinpei Hanaoka, a Mazda board member and former banker, recommended that a rotary engined sports car be developed. Soon after Project X605 began. This was different from the prior attempt, in that a new chassis was developed for the sole purpose of accommodating the rotary engine's compact dimensions. Akio was tasked with assisting Sumio Mochizuki, the Chief Project Engineer, in designing the chassis. Styling was handled by Yasuji Oda and Matasaburo Maeda. The creation of the rotary engine design was given to Kenichi Yamamoto.\nThe rotary engine was compact, small, and helped in the 50/50 weight distribution resulting in exceptional handling. Instead of focusing on maximum horsepower, a fuel-efficient 12A version was opted chosen. The engine was placed in the front and designed to power the rear wheels. To reduce production costs, the suspension was borrowed from the production vehicles. The front had McPherson struts and coil springs and the rear was a live axle with coil springs. The steering was re-circulating ball. Disc brakes were placed in the front while the rear brakes were drums. The chassis was comprised of monocoque which helped reduce weight while increasing structural rigidity. The rear window was originally a one-piece wrap around sheet but was replaced in favor of a cheaper and more reliable 3-peice design. During wind tunnel testing it was revealed that the design had an excellent aerodynamic drag, equivalent to a Porsche 924. With the headlights exposed, the drag was reduced from 0.36 to 0.38 CD, similar to the Datsun 280Z.\nThree transmission were available; a three-speed automatic, four- and five-speed manual.\nThe 12A rotary engine, with the help of modifications, was able to produce five extra horsepower and three more pounds-feet of torque. Fuel injection was attempted but did not work with the exhaust thermal reactor and would not have complied with United States safety and emission regulations. A characteristic of the engine is that it is very quiet. It is smooth and 'torqy' offering loads of performance.\nThe front seats were buckets with plaid designs and the rear was a bench seat. The instrument panel featured a 130 mph speedometer. The rev counter had dual purposes, first it reported revolutions per minute and when the ignition was on but the engine had not yet started, it served as a voltmeter. This was later changed to separate gauges.\nIn 1977 the prototype was finished and a year later in March of 1978 the RX7's were being produced at the Ujina plant. The RX-7 was introduced to the members of the press at Hiroshima and later debuted to the United States in April of 1978. The RX7, a.k.a. Project X605, was an immediate hit.\nThe Mazda RX7 was a practical sports car, highly competitive, and offered at a low price. Supply could not keep up with demand and many potential buyers were often offering more money above sticker price just to own one. There were initial quality problems but all issues were quickly resolved. By 1980 nearly 140,000 examples had been produced. Using a 12A rotary engine displacing 1.2 liters, it was capable of producing around 105 horsepower. Zero to sixty was accomplished in ten seconds.\nIn 1984 a more powerful 1.3 liter rotary engine was introduced, the 13B. The 13B produced 135 horsepower and was placed in the 'special edition' cars called the GSL-SE. The GSL-SE were given disc brakes on all four corners and a Limited Slip Differential. The zero to sixty time improved to just under nine seconds.\nThe main complaint for the car was its steering. Many believed that the recirculation ball should be replaced with a rack-and-pinion unit which could better keep up with the cars excellent performance and offer superior handling. Besides this, the car was given excellent reviews by all automotive magazines.\nThe RX7 was eligible for class C racing in the United States. Under IMSA's classification, it was eligible for 2.5 liter racing. After its domination on the racing circuit, the IMSA re-classified the RX7 at a higher minimum weight limit which allowed it to run in the more competitive GTX class.\nThe RX7 production continued until 1986. As time had progressed and as a bi-product of racing, the RX-7 had been much improved. However, the field of affordable sports cars was increasing and the RX-7 was in need of a replacement.\nThe Second Generation RX7\nChief Project Engineer Akio Uchiyama had traveled to the United States to become better acquainted with the demands of the RX-7's largest market. His interviews and the comments and suggestions received from the owners and prospective owners influenced the design of the second series of the RX-7.\nBy June 1981 the project was started. Akio Uchiyama chose the name P747 to represent this task. Various designs were created, each targeting different markets. The designs were labeled 'Realistic Sports Car', 'Technologically Advanced Sports Car', and a 'Civilised Sports Car'. The designs ranged from a hard-core sports car to designs that offered plush amenities and hints at its sporty-roots. The price of these potential cars were estimated to fall between $9000 through $13000 depending on the design chosen. In total there were around twenty designs created each representing different ideas of the next generation RX7. Two designs were chosen as 'favorites' and full-size clay models were developed and shown to consumers.\nBy February of 1983 a design was chosen. Takashi Ono was tasked with designing and building the exterior of the vehicle. Most of the demands made by Ono were carried through but a few needed to be redesigned based on consumer reaction and to accommodate mechanical components. The resulting prototypes achieved a 0.29 CD of aerodynamic efficiency. This was the result of a low hood and a 63.5 degree angle windshield.\nJiro Maebayshi was tasked with designing the suspension. The resulting mechanics was borrowed from a truck suspension created by Takao Kijima. The front and rear suspension were independent with the front incorporating McPherson struts. To make the car more maneuverable, four wheel steering was experimented with but unfortunately the results were not promising. Instead a system was adopted that allowed a small degree of rear steer to be created by the rear suspension during cornering. The rear wheels would steer in the same direction as the front increasing stability at high speeds. At low speeds the rear wheels would steer in the opposite direction of the front wheels. The system was dubbed the 'Dynamic Tracking System Suspension' and 'Triaxial Floating Hub'. The system did increase noise so to compensate the final drive system and rear suspension were mounted separately on the rear subframe. To reduce the noise caused by the subframe and the chassis, Rubber bushings were used. The rack-and-pinion steering and the updated suspension addressed the major pitfall of the first generation RX-7.\nThe second generation came with options, such as brake sizes and wheels. Standard were 9.8 inch ventilated disc brakes with the 10.3 inch disc with single piston floating iron calipers offered as optional equipment. Anti-lock braking system was not offered at the introduction of the vehicle but became available at a later date. The RX-7 could be purchased with a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission. A turbocharger system increased torque by nearly 30 percent.\nA luxury version was offered outfitted with cruise control, air conditioning, leather seats, power windows and a security system.\nThe 13B engine had been introduced in the first generation RX-7. It produced 135 horsepower and by reshaping the plenum, 11 extra horsepower was achieved. The plenum was curved again for the P747 in increase the power even further. Other modifications included the addition of a second fuel injection, new rotor apex seal, digitally controlled Bosch L-Jetronic, larger air cleaner, and wider throttle intake and valves. Through these and other efforts, more horsepower and better fuel economy was achieved, and the engine became more durable. At the end the engine produced nearly 150 horsepower and 138 foot-pounds of torque. This meant the vehicle could propel from zero to sixty in just eight seconds and top speed was achieved at nearly 130 mph. The turbocharged 13B version was rated at 182 horsepower and 183 foot-pounds of torque. The fuel economy was nearly identical to the non-turbo charged version, 17 city and 23 highway.\nThe interior was convenient, ergonomic, and modern. There were orange instrument needles, red lettering, 8000 RPM tachometer, four auxiliary dials for oil pressure, battery charge, fuel level and coolant temperature. The turbocharged versions had a boost gauge in place of the battery charge.\nThe RX-7 was offered in two-seater and 2+2 configuration, however the rear seats were small and was best used for luggage rather than transporting extra passengers.\nAfter design and development of the prototype P747 and before official approval to begin mass development the P747 ran into a problem. The United States would enforce a tax on all vehicles that weighed over 2875 pounds and did not meet a 22 mpg combined city/highway rating. P747 was too heavy and did not meet the combined gas rating and nearing the point where the project would be discontinued. Upper management allowed one month to reduce the weight and to improve fuel economy.\nEvery designer and engineer began removing items, replacing others with a lighter material, and searching for ways to reduce the weight. The cast iron wheel hubs were replaced with alloy and the spare tire jack was replaced with an aluminum unit. The final drive cover was replaced with an aluminum material and the suspension arms became forged aluminum. The weight-saving measures continued and in the end P747 weighed 2630 pounds, still a hundred pounds more than the first generation RX7 but it did include many mechanical and electrical improvements and features. The major downside to using the lightweight material was that it was more expensive than the steel that it replaced.\nThe name RX-7 was retained, although many believed that it would have been given the name RX-8, the next logical succession in the Mazda naming convention.\nIntroduced in 1986 it was immediate successful. Sales were strong and higher than any other year for the RX-7. The 13B 1.3 liter rotary engine producing 146 horsepower was standard as was the four-wheel disc brakes. The turbo version, named the 'Turbo II', increased the horsepower to 182 horsepower. Zero to sixty was achieved in 6.8 seconds in the turbocharged version while the naturally aspirated engines achieved 60 mph in 7.7 seconds.\nFor 1987 sales slowed but this was expected. Improvements were added, defects were fixed, and the RX-7 continued to evolve. The luxury and turbo versions were outfitted with antilock brakes as standard equipment. A convertible option became available from the factory. The rear window was made of glass and had a defrost mechanism built-in. In America the Convertible option came with the naturally aspirated engine and a manual gear box. Anything more and the car would have been too heavy, qualifying for the Gas Guzzler Tax. In other countries, the RX-7 Convertible could be purchased with the Turbo and other optional equipment.\nThroughout the years Mazda introduced various specialty versions to commemorate special occasions, to offer an exclusive line-up, and to improve sales. A tenth Anniversary special edition honored the ten years of production for the RX-7.\nBy the close of the 1980's, the 13B naturally aspirated engine had been improved to produce 160 horsepower, the turbo version producing as high as 200 horsepower. The axle and gear ratios were improved to handle the increase in power. The gear shift mechanism was changed in favor of a shorter-throw unit. Steering was improved through the use of engine speed sensing instead of the prior speed-sensing steering.\nIn 1989 the Mazda Miata was introduced, revitalizing sales for the small, simple, two-seater sports car market. Many believe it stole sales away from the RX-7, which for 1990 saw sales slowing down. The RX-7 was still the choice for sports car performance while the Miata became the cheap sports car options.\nBy 1992 the production of the second generation RX-7 had came to an end. 1990 was the final year for the GXL 2+2 hatchback. From 1991 onward all Mazda RX-7's were two seaters. Since the redesigned 1993 RX-7 model was introduced early, there were no official 1992 RX-7's.\nThe Third Generation RX7\nDebuted in 1993, the third generation Mazda RX-7 was available only as a two-door hatchback. Under the hood was a new twin-sequential turbocharged 13B-REW rotary engine producing an astonishing 255 horsepower. A five speed manual and four-speed automatic were offered. On all four corners were Anti-Lock disc brakes. Safety was improved with the introduction of a drivers-side airbag.\nWeighing 190 pounds less than its predecessor and offering 50/50 weight distribution, the powerful and redesigned third generation RX-7 was a performance machine.\nThe RX-7 was offered with two packages that could not be combined. The first was the R-1 designed for those searching for the ultimate performance from their RX-7. The package added body spoilers and dual oil coolers. The Touring Package was offered for those seeking luxury from their sports car. This package added leather seats, Bose speakers, steering wheel mounted cruise control, and a power sunroof.\nIn 1994 safety was enhanced with the addition of a passenger side airbag. Map pockets and a revised dashboard were also new for 1994. The performance package was now called the R-2. A new package was offered called the Popular Equipment package. This included power sunroof, rear cargo cover and leather seats.\nCompared to the prior versions, the third generation RX-7 was short lived. Its performance, handling, low weight, and styling continued the legacy established by the first and second generation. The downfall for the third generation RX-7 was its sticker price costing over $35,000 in 1995. 1995 would be the last year the RX-7 was produced. Ending a legacy and bringing to end the production of the rotary engine, at least for a while. With the introduction of the Rx8, the rotary engine has been reintroduced. A new chapter is beginning.By Daniel Vaughan | Sep 2007\nThe most famous aspect of this vehicle is probably the engine. It was a revolutionary engine created by Felix Wankel and named the 'Wankel Rotary Engine.' Inside an elongated chamber, a rotor with three curved sides revolves around a central driveshaft. Air and fuel enter from the sides and are compressed as the rotor spins. The result is the equivalent of a conventional combustion chamber.\nDuring the design and planning of the engine it was believed to have so much more to offer than the traditional engine. It has fewer moving parts and no pistons making power delivery smoother. There were very high-hopes for it. However, after it was built it was plagued with technical problems mainly leaks in the combustion chamber and rotor tip wear. These issues were addressed but they took time. Many of the issues were ironed out by the time the RX-7 was ready for production. The next issue was poor fuel economy and inadequate power at lower speeds.\nThe design was done by Mazda's Matasaburo Maeda. It was very appealing, sleek, and sporty. This, coupled with the new engine created a successful combination.\nThe first-generation was in production for seven years. During that time only minor aesthetic changes were introduced. Mechanical enhancements, on the other-hand, were more frequent. In 1981 the car was given more horsepower, and then again in 1983 with the electronically fuel-injected limited edition Turbo. During its production run, nearly half-a-million units were built.\nThe second generation RX-7 came into existence in 1985.By Daniel Vaughan | Sep 2007\nFor more information and related vehicles, click here""]"	['<urn:uuid:0e3e5e1f-8dae-4be3-afe4-9a905c7a24e1>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-01T23:55:16.606337	6	27	2679
