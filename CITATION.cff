  This paper presents the RMIT-ADM+S participation in the
  SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge. Our
  Generation-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG) approach
  relies on generating a hypothetical answer that is used in
  the retrieval phase, alongside the original question. GRAG
  also incorporates a pointwise large language model
  (LLM)-based re-ranking step prior to final answer
  generation. We describe the system architecture and the
  rationale behind our design choices. In particular, a
  systematic evaluation using the Grid of Points (GoP)
  framework and N-way ANOVA enabled comparison across
  multiple configurations, including query variant
  generation, question decomposition, rank fusion
  strategies, and prompting techniques for answer
  generation. Our system achieved a Relevance score of 1.199
  and a Faithfulness score of 0.477 on the private
  leaderboard, placing among the top four finalists in the
  LiveRAG 2025 Challenge.
