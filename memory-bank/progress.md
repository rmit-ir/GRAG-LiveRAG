# Technical Progress: LiveRAG

## Implemented Components

- Basic project structure and organization
- Vector database integration with Pinecone
- Vector database integration with OpenSearch
- Embedding utilities for text-to-vector conversion
- AWS utilities for cloud integration
- DataMorgana client for Q&A generation
- Path utilities for file management
- Test notebooks for index evaluation

## Components To Be Implemented

- Complete RAG pipeline integration
- Falcon3-10B-Instruct LLM integration
- Prompt engineering for effective context utilization
- Response generation with 200-token limit
- Evaluation framework for relevance and faithfulness
- Comprehensive testing with DataMorgana-generated Q&A pairs
- Optimization for challenge metrics
- Documentation and examples

## Current Technical Status

The project is in active development with core vector search capabilities implemented and tested. The focus is currently on evaluating different index providers and embedding strategies before moving on to the complete RAG pipeline implementation.

## Technical Issues

- Main.py is currently a placeholder and needs to be updated
- No error handling for API rate limits and service disruptions
- Limited documentation for the implemented services
- No comprehensive evaluation framework yet
- No integration with Falcon3-10B-Instruct LLM yet
